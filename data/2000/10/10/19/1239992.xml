        <p>With just a month or two before their proposed merger is expected to be consummated, America Online and Time Warner each posted quarterly earnings yesterday that were largely as expected. But the top management of both companies spent much of the day trying to counter the pessimism on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>They argued that they would not be hurt by any slowdown in advertising by Internet companies and indeed had already discovered ways that their combination would accelerate their growth.</p>
        <p>''We will be able to achieve more value creation for shareholders together than either of us could achieve alone,'' Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chief executive, said in a two-hour meeting with analysts yesterday morning at the Time Life Building in Manhattan to discuss Time Warner's results. That was followed by a lunch for journalists and an hourlong conference call yesterday afternoon to discuss America Online's results.</p>
        <p>The executives were reacting to the increasing doubts about the companies' prospects implicit in their stock prices. On Tuesday, Time Warner's shares fell 16 percent and America Online's shares fell 17 percent. Both media and Internet stocks have been hard hit as investors worry that economic uncertainties, particularly the dot-com downturn, could hurt ad sales.</p>
        <p>Stephen M. Case, the chairman of America Online, argued that the advertising client lists of both companies were quite diversified, with established companies outnumbering start-ups. ''We have looked at our vulnerability to the dot-com sector, and only a few percentage points are potentially at risk,'' Mr. Case said in an interview. ''Some businesses don't succeed, but other ones come to take their place. That's no different on the Internet than on television or with billboards.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, as media company shares gained but most Internet companies saw their stocks fall further, the shares of Time Warner and America Online rebounded. Time Warner's stock rose $3.69, to $69.25, and America Online was up $3.31, to $46.91. After hours, America Online's shares rose as high as $51.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin also sought to reassure investors that the companies were ''highly confident'' that they would pass their review by federal regulators without debilitating conditions and would close the deal before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Last week, the merger was approved by European regulators, but only after Time Warner withdrew its proposed joint venture in music publishing with EMI. Mr. Levin said the companies hoped to renegotiate a deal with EMI and submit it again to European regulators next year.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the results posted by both companies were mixed but generally on track with expectations. Both slightly beat their earnings-per-share forecasts. But Time Warner fell short of expected revenue. And America Online's closely watched advertising backlog -- a measure of contracts for revenue in future quarters -- showed no growth in the quarter. But in a period when companies big and small are announcing significant shortfalls, analysts took that as good news.</p>
        <p>''In this market coming in at expectations is significant when so many companies are not able to do that,'' said Paul W. Noglows, an analyst at Chase H&amp;Q.</p>
        <p>Specifically, America Online earned $345 million, up from $181 million a year earlier, an increase of 91 percent. Its revenue grew 34 percent, to $2 billion.</p>
        <p>Excluding one-time items and certain tax breaks, the company earned 14 cents a share, higher than the 13 cents analysts expected.</p>
        <p>Time Warner earned $85 million, down 76 percent from a year earlier. Last year, Time Warner had a number of unusual items including a $477 million gain related to the sale of cable systems. Its revenue was $6.9 billion, up 3 percent, but substantially shy of Wall Street's expectations of $7.3 billion.</p>
        <p>On a per-share basis, excluding one-time items, the company earned 7 cents a share, higher than the 4 cents that Wall Street expected.</p>
        <p>In any case, the company prefers for investors to look at its operating cash flow -- earnings before taxes and some noncash accounting charges -- adjusted to remove one-time items. By that measure, the company's operating cash flow was  $1.27 billion, up 13 percent.</p>
        <p>The companies said they had completed a joint business plan and budget, in anticipation of the merger, and they reiterated their aggressive targets for future growth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin said the combined company wanted its operating profit to increase 30 percent next year and 25 percent in subsequent years.</p>
        <p>''It's significant, given everything that is happening in the market, that they didn't back away from their forecasts,'' Mr. Noglows said. ''This company wants to grow faster than other diversified media companies, which have growth rates in the high teens and low 20's.''</p>
        <p>Both companies said advertising represented their fastest-growing source of revenue. Time Warner's advertising revenue grew 17 percent, to $1.3 billion. The same category at America Online increased 80 percent, to $649 million.</p>
        <p>Subscriber growth at America Online continued to be brisk, despite even more aggressive competition from Microsoft's MSN service. Its flagship America Online service added 1.4 million subscribers in the quarter to 24.6 million worldwide, as international growth made up for a slowdown in the United States.</p>
        <p>At Time Warner, cable systems and networks, which include HBO and CNN, were the strongest divisions. Cash flow declined 6 percent in the company's movie studio, its largest division by revenue. But its Warner Music division, which has been struggling, increased cash flow by 10 percent.</p>
