        <p>Mike Tyson's tour of Detroit continued today with an entertaining workout at the gym where Joe Louis once trained, a modest brick facility at the doorstep of the city housing project where Diana Ross and the Supremes were raised.</p>
        <p>Tyson, preparing for his fight with Andrew Golota on Friday, said he had been filled with the spirit of Louis, the great heavyweight from Detroit.</p>
        <p>''He had tears in his eyes just looking at the place,'' said Stacy McKinley, a Tyson assistant trainer and a former Michigan boxing champion who suggested using the old gym.</p>
        <p>Louis actually trained in a now dilapidated downstairs section of the Brewster/Wheeler Recreation Center, a spot Tyson visited.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, Tyson had erected his own boxing ring. On the way in, he passed a small sign outlining some guidelines of conduct that read: ''No profanity. No spitting. No verbal abuse.''  During an hourlong workout, and especially in a seven-minute interview session afterward, Tyson broke all three rules.</p>
        <p>''I feel very happy here but I know I'm the bad guy,'' Tyson said. ''I'm always the bad guy. But I enjoy it. I've never been loved and if I have been loved it's not enough to make me happy.''</p>
        <p>Tyson also said, in an offhanded way, that Friday's fight might be his last. And later, in an attempt to make an analogy, he made a coarse comment about domestic abuse. So, in many ways, it was a public performance typical of Tyson.</p>
        <p>''This could be my last fight,'' Tyson, 34, said. ''You never know. Everybody wants to talk to me about Lennox Lewis or whatever my next fight is. I've got one fight. Who knows after that?''</p>
        <p>Tyson's talk this week about being the bad guy, along with episodes of menacing behavior filled with profanity and invective, has been routine but brief. It has been much more common to see Tyson, who is taking a new unnamed antidepressant, smiling and relaxed.</p>
        <p>He waved to people attending today's spirited workout, signed autographs in the parking lot afterward and posed for pictures with children who came to the gym.</p>
        <p>And yet, in a recent Detroit television appearance, Tyson was on edge and churlish. When one of the show's hosts put his hand on Tyson's shoulder, Tyson slapped it away.</p>
        <p>Although Tyson said he has already been paid the nearly $10 million he is to receive for the fight, his behavior may be an act to help sell tickets in Detroit and for the nationwide pay-per-view broadcast. The fight will be staged in a Detroit suburb, at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich., which seats 20,000 for boxing. The gate is expected to be several thousand tickets short of a sellout.</p>
        <p>Thomas Hearns, the former boxing champion from Detroit, is one of the promoters of the fight.</p>
        <p>At Tuesday's news conference, when Tyson announced that he had already been paid, and Golota's handlers shouted, ''We got our money,'' Hearns interrupted, saying, ''Well, let's get it straight so I can get mine.''</p>
        <p>Hearns picked Tyson up at the airport Sunday and has tried to serve as something of an ambassador to the city for both Tyson and Golota. It was Hearns who also gave a telling response when asked if he thought Tyson's behavior was a put-on to help sell the fight.</p>
        <p>''Is it real or an act?'' Hearns said. ''Probably a little of both. He knows you must have showmanship. He comes across as angry, but I think that's just his way of getting people to listen.''</p>
        <p>One thing seems certain. However Tyson conducts himself, he always seems in character.</p>
        <p>Today, far from the gleaming office and hotel towers along the downtown Detroit River, Tyson was a cheerful presence working out in the humble quarters where Louis once toiled.</p>
        <p>''I have so much respect for this place,'' Tyson said after the session, sitting on the edge of the ring. ''It's almost like something out of fiction.''</p>
        <p>Less than a minute later, outraged at a reporter's question, he suggested he had to stop the interview before he hurt someone. Tyson then jumped off the ring's apron and stormed out of the gym.</p>
