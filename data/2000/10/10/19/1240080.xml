        <p>Burdened by overdue payments for its high-speed Internet services, Covad Communications reported a third-quarter loss of $190 million, or $1.22 a share, more than three times its loss in the period a year earlier. The company attributed the results to late payments from nine large clients. Several brokerage firms downgraded their recommendations on Covad stock to hold from buy, and the shares dropped 59 percent, to $3.56. Covad's difficulties underscore how numerous providers of broadband services are coming under financial strain even as they aggressively expand their customer bases and increase their revenue.</p>
