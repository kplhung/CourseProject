        <p>The National Music Publishers Association has reached a licensing agreement with the embattled digital music site MP3.com. If it is approved by the association's 25,000 members, the three-year agreement will permit distribution of more than a million digital music files on MP3.com's download service, which stores music files that subscribers have already paid for. ''This will enable the public to reach out and get their music, and the publishers to get their payment,'' said Ed Murphy, chief executive of the association. MP3.com has settled copyright violation cases with four major record labels. It is facing $100 million in damage payments after being found liable for infringing copyright owned by Seagram's Universal Music Group.</p>
