        <p>ORDERING furnishings from London, or anywhere in Europe, takes work, time, and, of course, money. Companies that make furniture to order like Twentytwentyone may require a 50 percent deposit, a final payment before shipping, and may not allow returns. Make sure that the final price includes shipping (from two weeks by air to 12 weeks by sea). For example, Inflate's Snoozy bed sells for $850, plus a $73 air freight charge; the Robin Day Avian armchair from Twentytwentyone will cost $1,703 plus $412 for air freight and Manhattan delivery, or $225 sea freight and Manhattan delivery.</p>
