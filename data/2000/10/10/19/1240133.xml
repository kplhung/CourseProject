        <p>KLEINMAN-Herbie Edward. Untimely passing October 17, 2000, just shy of his 30th birthday on November 1. Wonderful light of all our lives. Adored son of Nedra and Louis; best friend of brother Eric; beloved friend to so many people from childhood through his adult years. Everyone who met you, loved you Herbie. You enjoyed sports, rock music, and life itself. All of us enjoyed every minute of the time you spent with us. Your laughter and your love has always been our most joyful and treasured inspiration. Your leaving is unbearable for us but your life and love will stay within us in memory and with enduring love. Memorial service to be held at 12:45 PM on Friday, October 20 at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street (at Amsterdam Avenue) in New York City.</p>
