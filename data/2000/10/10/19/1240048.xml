        <p>If the Mets, who will play the Yankees in the World Series beginning Saturday night, were placed against the Mets, who played the Yankees in their first interleague series in 1997, the image would be startling.</p>
        <p>Only five players remain from the Mets' roster on those three days in June. The Yankees, who during George Steinbrenner's ownership have been notorious for rapid turnover of their roster, have more players left from that series.</p>
        <p>But then, the Yankees were already winners. The Mets had yet to figure out how to compete, either in their division or in New York.</p>
        <p>Exactly one month after the Mets won that first game with the Yankees behind Dave Mlicki's shutout pitching, the Mets changed general managers, firing Joe McIlvaine and promoting his assistant, Steve Phillips. Fred Wilpon, one of the team's co-owners, had lost confidence in McIlvaine and his philosophy.</p>
        <p>McIlvaine believed the Mets could win by building with young players, but the plan was not working. Because he stuck to his plan, McIlvaine wouldn't trade any of those youngsters for veteran players.</p>
        <p>''Joe was reluctant to trade young players for established guys,'' a baseball executive said yesterday. ''Like the Piazza trade the Mets made the following season, giving up three pretty good young players. There had been a reluctance to do that, but the mind-set changed.''</p>
        <p>At the urging of Nelson Doubleday, the other co-owner, Phillips aggressively pursued a trade for Piazza and succeeded in snaring him from the Florida Marlins on May 22, 1998. The previous winter Phillips acquired Al Leiter and Dennis Cook from the Marlins for five minor leaguers.</p>
        <p>Who knows? If the World Series champion Marlins had not decided to decimate their team, the Mets might have never overcome the plan to win with youngsters. Few teams succeed with that strategy. The Oakland Athletics and the Chicago White Sox reached the playoffs this year with basically young teams, but they were the first to do so in some years and they didn't last long in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The Steinbrenner Yankees, of course, have never built a winning team with young players. In fact, until Gene Michael, the general manager during the years Steinbrenner was suspended in the early 90's, halted the practice, the Yankees more often than not traded some of their best young players for veterans, and not always good ones. But now the Yankees have a nucleus of home-grown talent: Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera.</p>
        <p>Those five players are among a dozen remaining from the Yankees roster for that first interleague series with the Mets.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, who had won the World Series the previous October, won the second and third games of the first Mets-Yankees series, then won two of three the following season.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Bud Selig had looked at the intense interest that accompanied those Mets-Yankees series and saw that it was good, and he proclaimed that if one series was good, two would be better.</p>
        <p>Thus, in 1999, the teams played three games in each park, the home team winning twice in each series. They tried that format again this year, but the third game at Yankee Stadium was rained out. The postponement led to a unusual event. In the middle of the second series, the teams played a Saturday doubleheader, an afternoon game at Shea Stadium and a night game at Yankee Stadium. In the night game, Roger Clemens hit Mike Piazza in the head with a pitch.</p>
        <p>The Mets are not expected to get a clean shot at Clemens in the World Series because he will most likely pitch at Yankee Stadium, where the designated hitter will be in effect, and not Shea and therefore will not bat. The Mets would most likely not try to retaliate, anyway. Too much is at stake. But because so much is at stake, Clemens can be expected to knock somebody down as an attempt at intimidation. He did it with Alex Rodriguez of Seattle in the American League series. That's his style.</p>
        <p>The best way for the Mets to retaliate is to hit Clemens hard. They have beaten him three times in the last two years, with Leiter winning all three times.</p>
        <p>Pitching should determine the outcome of the series. The Yankees have an edge in top-flight starters, with Pettitte, Clemens and Orlando Hernandez lining up against the Mets' pair, Leiter and Mike Hampton. The Yankees also have an edge in closing relief. As good as Armando Benitez has been for the Mets, he is more likely to give up a big hit at a critical time (see J. T. Snow's three-run home run in Game 2 of the division series) than Rivera.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees could encounter difficulty with other segments of their bullpen.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre clearly seemed to be reluctant to call on Jeff Nelson or Mike Stanton Tuesday night when Hernandez was getting up in his pitch count. Torre let Hernandez start the eighth inning and then brought in Rivera when he couldn't get an out. The Mets' relief corps has also given up key runs at times, but it is deep in numbers and often in effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Pitching alone won't win the series and lose it. The Yankees, for example, have to neutralize Edgardo Alfonzo, whose penchant for driving in big runs has become well known. They also have to find a way to keep Timo Perez, the Mets' new leadoff batter, off base. He was a sensation in the St. Louis series, being the first batter to reach base in five of the seven innings in which the Mets scored in the last two games.</p>
        <p>Perez was so new the Cardinals hardly had time to figure him out, but Yankees scouts have had six additional games to scrutinize him and concoct a way to dilute his effectiveness.</p>
        <p>The Mets won't know where the Yankees' offensive threat might develop each night -- even Paul O'Neill stroked two singles and drove in three runs Tuesday night -- but they would do well to keep David Justice's fly balls in the park.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have one factor the Mets cannot match, and that is their postseason experience. The Yankees came back against the Mariners in Game 6 because they know how to do that sort of thing. For the Mets to win, their pitchers will either have to shut down the Yankees' hitters completely or their hitters will have to batter the Yankees' pitchers like no one else in the last three postseasons.</p>
        <p>And in case anyone was wondering, the five players left from the Mets' roster for that first interleague series are Alfonzo, Bobby J. Jones, Rick Reed, John Franco and Matt Franco.</p>
