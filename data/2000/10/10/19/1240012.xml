        <p>A day after meeting in Egypt, Israeli and Palestinian leaders took their first promised steps to avert further violence, with Israel pulling back some troops and reopening border posts and the Palestinian Authority pledging to ''work on calming the situation.''</p>
        <p>But these initial moves toward the truce negotiated on Tuesday were accompanied by continuing skirmishes between soldiers and rioters, and by Israel's reported capture of Palestinians it accuses of taking part in the mob killing of two of its soldiers last week.</p>
        <p>Israeli authorities tonight would not confirm local reports that they are holding as many as eight Palestinians, including several police officers, who were photographed at the beating and stabbing death of the two armed Israeli reservists on Thursday at Ramallah's central police station. But they also did not deny it, and they repeated warnings that those involved in the killings would be found and punished.</p>
        <p>Ephraim Sneh, the deputy defense minister, told Israeli television tonight, ''I say in the most unequivocal way possible: justice will reach those people who perpetrated this act, just like it reached those who perpetrated the Munich massacre,'' referring to the siege of the 1972 Summer Olympics in which two Israeli Olympians were killed by Palestinian terrorists and nine Israelis died later in a gunfight.</p>
        <p>He added, ''I only ask, please don't ask me to divulge details, because that is liable to ruin things.''</p>
        <p>The report of the arrests was cheered by Israelis but denounced by Palestinians, who accused Israel of abducting the men from Palestinian territory. ''If this is true, it would be a sure violation'' of the agreement reached at Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, Abu Abdul Rachman, chief of staff of the Palestinian Authority cabinet, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Though armed clashes continued in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the 20th straight day -- rioting was intense in Gaza, where scores of Palestinians were injured -- the Israelis this time did not accuse the Palestinian leadership of deliberately fomenting the violence. And the Palestinians did not level their familiar charges that the Israelis were using reckless force to repress the protests.</p>
        <p>In perhaps the most striking change, Palestinian leaders began publicly urging an end to the street battles with Israeli troops that have left more than a hundred Palestinians dead in three weeks.</p>
        <p>''We don't want any more blood to be spilled,'' Mahmoud Abbas, the veteran P.L.O. leader, better known as Abu Mazen, told a group of Palestinian journalists tonight. The Palestinian leadership hopes that peace talks can resume within a month, but that will require stricter control of protests and the ''security chaos'' created by armed militias on Palestinian streets, he said.</p>
        <p>''The demonstrations inside our towns, nobody can stop,'' he said. ''But the clashes, with more loss of life, this is too much and it must end.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, a senior official of the Clinton administration said it was satisfied with the actions both sides took today.</p>
        <p>Most important, said the official, ''both sides believe that the other side has fulfilled the statement requirements of Sharm.'' Still, with tensions so high, he said, it was impossible to ''prejudge the next few days.''</p>
        <p>Israeli and Palestinian security chiefs met today to coordinate further reciprocal actions to reduce tensions, including the removal of Israeli troops and weapons from crossroads and other flash points that have been the scene of recurring clashes in the past 20 days of street violence.</p>
        <p>After the meeting, Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced he was ordering the reopening of the international border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. He said he was also easing the ban on travel by Palestinians between the major Palestinian cities of the West Bank, though Israelis are still denied entry into the Palestinian territories, and most Palestinian laborers cannot get permits to work in Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's office said that if violence subsides over the next two days, Israel will take further measures to relax internal border strictures, and it will withdraw from other zones of confrontation.</p>
        <p>''From our point of view, the first steps toward the implementation of the Sharm statement have been taken,'' said Nachman Shai, Israel's chief press spokesman. ''From this point begins the countdown of the 48 hours in which both parties have to take a number of measures in order to produce calm and a cessation of violence.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, in a three-hour leadership meeting of Yasir Arafat's Fatah movement, top political and military aides discussed ways to keep the faction's street protests from escalating into armed confrontations. Among those attending the closed-door session of the Fatah Revolutionary Council were Jibril Rajoub, the chief of Palestinian security services in the West Bank, and Ismail Jaber, commander of the uniformed Palestinian forces there.</p>
        <p>''We discussed it, and we will deliver our report to the president,'' said Mr. Abbas, who is outranked in the Fatah movement only by Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>Leaving the meeting early was a clearly disgruntled Marwan Barghouti, the leader of the movement's West Bank militia, which Israel accuses of courting violent retaliation by interspersing snipers and bomb-throwers in crowds of protesters. The Fatah militia organized demonstrations across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip today to protest the Sharm el Sheik accords.</p>
        <p>''It is not important what they are discussing inside, because the Sharm summit was a failure,'' he said, heading off to a Fatah protest march he had organized.</p>
        <p>But the demonstration was smaller and more subdued than most recent protests here, and marchers largely stayed clear of the Israeli checkpoint at the edge of town that been the scene of near-constant street battles in the past three weeks.</p>
        <p>Despite the renewed communications and signs of mutual restraint, distrust remains acute.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Barak, who issued a statement promising to abide by the agreement, had refused to proceed with the truce arrangements until Mr. Arafat made a similar declaration.</p>
        <p>Israel said it did not recognize as such a statement issued this morning by the Palestinian cabinet and P.L.O. Executive Committee that expressed disappointment that the Sharm el Sheik pact ''did not meet the expectations of the Palestinian people and the Arab nation.''</p>
        <p>The Palestinians then put out a second statement -- released by Mr. Arafat's office, but attributed to ''a Palestinian official source'' -- that circuitously noted that the Palestinian Authority had already endorsed the Egyptian agreement, which requires both parties to ''refrain from taking any action that might lead to tension and violence, and to work on calming the situation.'' Mr. Barak said that would do, and ordered the army to begin removing roadblocks and tanks from several checkpoints.</p>
        <p>In one marked change of tone, Israeli officials were no longer asserting that Mr. Arafat exercises near-monolithic control over Palestinian protesters, or even over his own security forces. Officials predicted it could take days or weeks for Palestinian leaders to restore order.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinian side, as we know, is not an organization with a clear hierarchy of power,'' said Gen. Yom Tov Samia, who commands Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>''I told the Palestinian leaders at the beginning of the riots two and a half weeks ago: Keep in mind that the people who are out of your control today, giving us a hard time, will be out of your control tomorrow, giving you a hard time,'' he said. ''And that has already started.''</p>
