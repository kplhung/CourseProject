        <p>AS the owner of five large Victorian houses divided into more than a dozen apartments here, Jackie Craven finds herself telling a painter how to do the trim on an 1880's stick-style Victorian. Then again, Ms. Craven, a guide to architecture and home repair on the Web site www.about.com, gives a lot of instructions all the time, in addition to answering questions both easy (''How do I fix a dripping faucet?'') and hard (''What color should I paint my house?'').</p>
        <p>Ms. Craven, 49, has become one of the Internet's reigning authorities on buildings and architecture, a resource for people who want to know about plumbing, Frank Gehry or the Taj Mahal. She is one of about 700 experts at About.com, an Internet portal that offers information and links on everything from gambling to grapefruit. She answers questions from students writing term papers on Le Corbusier. ''They tell me if I don't answer in two hours, they're going to flunk,'' she said. She tells them where to look it up. . She gets requests for house plans for the disabled and leads discussions on subjects like ''Why aren't there more women architects?''</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, Ms. Craven was an English teacher who had moved from Virginia to upstate New York. She bought her first of five Schenectady houses -- some of them with partners -- in 1984 and became a serial renovator.</p>
        <p>''You think you're just going to paint, and before you know it you're knocking down walls,'' she said. In 1996, Ms. Craven, by then writing a home renovation column for a local newspaper, signed on to the Internet for the first time. She auditioned to be a guide and soon learned how to build Web pages. At the end of 1998, she began her current spot on www.about.com. To find her, go to ''home/garden'' and then click on architecture.</p>
        <p>About.com guides are paid according to the number of times their pages are viewed each month. Luckily, Ms. Craven said, ''architecture is a nice, broad topic.'' Although she doesn't do as well as some of her colleagues (pregnancy and Southern cooking are much more popular at about.com, which recently ranked as the seventh-most-visited Web site), she does better than some. Think chemistry.</p>
        <p>The payment plan gives Ms. Craven an incentive to lure readers into her pages. Her main page now offers such inducements as ''Star Wars Architecture'' -- an architectural tour of three planets featured in ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' And she pronounced September Skyscraper Month, after discovering that three pioneers of tall buildings -- Louis Sullivan, William Holabird and William Le Baron Jenney -- had September birthdays.</p>
        <p>Ms. Craven writes new pages (she has about 1,000 of them available), creates links to other sites and runs interactive forums. Although she has the ability to delete intemperate language, she says she has not had to; architecture buffs, she says, ''are pretty even tempered.''</p>
        <p>The most popular subject on her home page is building plans, she said. After some people complained that most of the plans they find are for big houses, she assembled a library of small-house plans. In addition, telling the age of your old house does well, she said.</p>
        <p>''My site is really architecture for just plain folks,'' she said. ''It's nonpretentious.''</p>
        <p>Still, she has written about the architect Rem Koolhaas, not because there were requests, but because she said she found the subject intriguing. And the most popular architect on her site would be? In one recent week, Frank Lloyd Wright came in first, Michael Graves second and Frank Gehry third.</p>
