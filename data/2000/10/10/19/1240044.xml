        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would seek changes in state and federal medical assistance programs to offer city residents more protection against having their assets seized when the government is paying for a spouse's nursing home care.</p>
        <p>The mayor's comments followed emotional criticism, most recently before a City Council committee on Tuesday. The Public Advocate, Mark Green, and advocates for the elderly have charged the city with cruelty in enforcing state medical assistance rules.</p>
        <p>For married people who refuse to pay the nursing home bills of their spouses, state law allows the city's Human Resources Administration to seize all personal assets that exceed $84,120. The couple's home is exempt from that. The law also lets the city garnishee all of the affected couple's monthly income that exceeds $2,103.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said the law was unfair because it excluded people's homes from seizure by the government but not their cash, stocks or other disposable assets. Fewer New York City residents own their homes than elsewhere in the nation, he said, adding, ''I would like them to work out a formula that would treat people who don't own homes equitably.''</p>
        <p>The mayor did not provide details but said the change would enable New York City renters to keep more of their cash and disposable assets than current laws allow.</p>
        <p>Critics have focused mainly on the city's own policies, saying that the Human Resources Administration has the legal discretion to void financial claims against the poor and the elderly, including homeowners, who are already under severe duress.</p>
        <p>In his comments to reporters yesterday, Mr. Giuliani focused only on state and federal rules, and made no mention of the city's own collection policies. But an adviser to the mayor, who insisted that his name not be used, said Mr. Giuliani would instruct the Human Resources Administration to use more discretion with people who do not own their homes, and in some cases file claims for less of their assets than is currently dictated by state law.</p>
        <p>But the proposal did not satisfy Mr. Green, who responded in a prepared statement late yesterday.</p>
        <p>''The mayor's idea would help in the long run, but H.R.A. can and should do more right now,'' he said.  ''The mayor's own agency is targeting the life savings of elderly widows without regard to how much they can live on.''</p>
