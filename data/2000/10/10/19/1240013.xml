        <p>Party Prescriptions Elude Patients</p>
        <p>The model and former MTV D.J. KAREN DUFFY says that several hundred invitations to the party for her book, ''Model Patient,'' were not delivered, and she suspects the messenger made off with them.</p>
        <p>The ones that she sent by mail made it, she says, but the rest are probably being sold on some street corner somewhere.</p>
        <p>The problem is that the invitations looked like prescription bottles, with the phrase ''You are prescribed to have a good time'' where the medication, dosage and doctor's name would normally appear. Each bottle was filled with pink and white licorice-flavored candies that looked like pills, the kind one would probably need a prescription to obtain if they contained something stronger than candy.</p>
        <p>''Some people do their job too well,'' said Ms. Duffy, who appeared in several Woody Allen films and is now a correspondent for MICHAEL MOORE'S television program ''The Awful Truth.''</p>
        <p>''Maybe I worked a little too hard to make it look authentic. But I wonder: Are there a bunch of people at nightclubs ingesting my invitations? I mean, I worked three years on this book, and my mother-in-law and my sisters and friends who are all talking to each other didn't get invited, and I'm trying to get myself out of the doghouse.''</p>
        <p>Her manager, PEG DONEGAN, said that Ms. Duffy's guest list had 500 names; Ms. Duffy said that 400 were to be delivered by a messenger service.</p>
        <p>''We started calling the list,'' Ms. Donegan said. ''More than half don't seem  to have gotten to their rightful people. She sent a bunch to her doctors at New York Hospital, and they didn't get through. HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S didn't get through. I didn't even get mine.''</p>
        <p>Conroy and Citadel Lay Down Arms</p>
        <p>PAT CONROY'S alma mater, The Citadel, banned his first book and refused to let cameras on campus for the film version of another. But now Mr. Conroy and The Citadel, in Charleston, S.C., have gone beyond the truce or cease-fire stage. Tomorrow, The Associated Press said, The Citadel will confer an honorary degree on Mr. Conroy.</p>
        <p>''It comes as a shock, but a nice one,'' he told A.P. Then Mr. Conroy, 55, who graduated in 1967, added: ''I never penciled this in on the lists of awards I'd get in my life. I didn't want to be 70 years old and fighting with my college.'' His 1980 novel ''The Lords of Discipline'' was about a cadet's first year at a renowned military institute in -- where else? -- Charleston, S.C.</p>
        <p>Remembering A Prime Minister</p>
        <p>The napkins were printed with sayings from the hostess's grandfather: ''All men are worms -- I am a glowworm!'' and ''I have never promised anything but blood, tears, toil and sweat.''</p>
        <p>The hostess was EDWINA SANDYS. Her grandfather was Winston S. Churchill. And the napkins were for a party at (appropriately enough, considering the hostess) the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, on East 58th Street near Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>The party was for the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library in the United States, which is in Fulton, Mo.</p>
        <p>The historian JAMES HUMES recalled meeting Churchill in 1953, when Mr. Humes was an 18-year-old schoolboy. ''He put his hand on mine and said, 'Study history. In history lie all the secrets of statecraft,' '' Mr. Humes said. ''So I went back to my room and tore down the picture of Ted Williams and put up one of Winston Churchill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Humes saw Churchill again in 1959, at Andrews Air Force Base.</p>
        <p>''It was raining, and there was a crowd to see him off, people like Walter Lippmann, who wouldn't cross the street to see General Eisenhower,'' Mr. Humes said.</p>
        <p>He moved across the floor in an imitation of Churchill going across the tarmac and climbing the steps to the airplane. ''He turned and said, 'Farewell to the land of my . . . mother,' with that exquisite pause. I'm a coward, but I'd have charged the trenches on that one. Lippmann had tears in his eyes.''</p>
