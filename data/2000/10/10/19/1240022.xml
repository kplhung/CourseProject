        <p>Seventeen of those prized catches of the political season -- undecided voters from a swing state -- munched on a buffet dinner of chicken and meatballs before the presidential debate on Tuesday as a CNN anchor and then a CNN news executive gave them their marching orders for the night.</p>
        <p>''I'd like you to be as honest and open and candid as you can be,'' said the anchor, Wolf Blitzer. Lucy Spiegel, the network's vice president for weekend political programming, added: ''We want your stories. We want how you feel, how you react. Just be yourselves, and that's just fine with us.''</p>
        <p>The 17 Michiganders -- carpenters and secretaries and homemakers from places like Pontiac and Westland and Inkster -- were about to make their bows as participants in  the latest fad in television journalism: the on-air focus group.</p>
        <p>Say goodbye to the man on the street. Television wants the crowd on the set.</p>
        <p>Eager to outpace their rivals in gauging instantaneous reaction to convention speeches, campaign addresses and presidential debates, broadcast and cable news networks are gathering voters by the roomful as never before and extracting from them visceral responses to an event that has only just ended.</p>
        <p>Newspapers do this sort of thing, too, as The New York Times did on Tuesday night with some 20 viewers in Michigan. Some have even used such panels to pick a debate winner. USA Today, for instance, assembled 10 undecided voters from the Chicago area to watch and respond on Tuesday night. (The result: most liked the vice president.) On its front page today, The Detroit News provided the second installment in its coverage of the post-debate reactions of a panel of Oakland County residents. (A dead heat.)</p>
        <p>And it is not only group discussions that are providing instant opinion from small numbers of the electorate. Snap poll results are being reported on CBS, ABC and CNN within minutes of a debate's conclusion, and online focus groups are being used by the Fox News Channel for real-time analysis.</p>
        <p>The incessant probing and sampling have contributed to something like a rush to judgment, some pollsters say, and the trend worries them. This week, in fact, the American Association for Public Opinion Research, an organization representing 1,500 academic, governmental and commercial pollsters, took the unusual step of publicly criticizing several news outlets for what it called mistakes and misrepresentations in the way they have used focus-group techniques.</p>
        <p>The association's president, Murray Edelman, editorial director of the Voter News Service, which conducts exit polling on Election Day for a consortium of major networks, said the most troubling aspect of the craze surrounding focus groups was the effort to draw larger conclusions about the electorate as a whole.</p>
        <p>''I think they're very useful tools for humanizing stories that journalists want to cover,'' said one polling expert, Michael Traugott, a political science professor at the University of Michigan who has conducted focus groups for the news media. ''The problem arises when a journalist makes a statement that attempts to generalize, or to say that based on these 12 people, Bush won or Gore won.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Traugott, a former president of the pollsters' association, pointed, for example, to NBC News's characterization of a focus group in Tampa, Fla., on the night of the second presidential debate as representing a fairly good cross-section of undecided voters in northern Florida.</p>
        <p>The problem? The group consisted of six people, a number that Mr. Traugott said was representative of nothing. To which Mr. Edelman added: ''It's faulty on all sorts of levels. There's no statistical basis to conclude anything.''</p>
        <p>The criticism flabbergasted some officials at NBC and its cable sister MSNBC, which conducts focus groups with the Republican pollster Frank Luntz.</p>
        <p>''This group seems to think we're in the same business as they are,'' declared Stephen Capus, executive producer of ''The News With Brian Williams.'' ''I can only come to the conclusion that they feel threatened by seeing the faces and hearing the voices of real voters, and they would much rather we put people to sleep with charts and graphs.''</p>
        <p>From the video chronicle of game-show combatants on a deserted island off Malaysia to the public relations tactics of George W. Bush and Al Gore, ''real people'' is the mantra of the moment, and producers and editors are in businesses obsessed with trends. Their professions have also long sought better and better methods of tracking the vox populi, and with polls showing that this presidential election could be the tightest in 40 years, there is added pressure and interest in identifying and talking to voters who have yet to make up their minds.</p>
        <p>In addition, the embrace of the focus group reflects a desire by the networks to turn the camera for a few minutes from the legions of talking heads that dominate political discourse on television. Joshua King, vice president for national affairs at Speakout.com, an opinion sampler that staged online ''Rate the Debate'' sessions with the Fox News Channel, says giving viewers the option of evaluating the candidates as they speak by registering responses on the Internet intensifies viewer interest in the democratic process.</p>
        <p>What he monitors closely, Mr. King said, is how the network anchors and commentators interpret what these unscientifically self-selected focus-group participants are saying. ''I watch that they say that this is not a scientific sample, that these are just the people watching the debate on Fox News, and it's only one part of the story.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Traugott and Mr. Edelman said they had no problem with the use of focus groups as long as such caveats were clearly expressed. In fact, both said that in debate analysis on Tuesday night, some networks seemed to take greater pains than before to explain to viewers that the focus-group results bore no particular relation to the views of voters in their state or region.</p>
        <p>Here in Warren, a blue-collar city about 45 minutes north of downtown Detroit, CNN brought together a group of voters it called ''undecideds'' and ''persuadables,'' the latter being those who might be persuaded to alter their leanings. They were located for the network by the Gallup Poll, which surveyed voters in the Detroit area and asked whether they would mind if CNN contacted them. The network invited about 20 to Warren; a few did not show up.</p>
        <p>Frank Newport, the poll's editor in chief, said focus groups, long a market research tool in industries trying to learn more about consumers' tastes, were a natural for journalism. ''It's a valid place to give real feeling behind the numbers,'' he said. ''It allows you to follow up and probe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blitzer, the CNN anchor, presided over the network's three post-debate focus groups, convened in highly contested states: Florida, Missouri and Michigan. At a production meeting on Tuesday afternoon in Warren, he and the focus-group segment's executive producer, Sue Bunda, talked over how to ensure that the views of the participants, who would watch the debate together on the CNN set in a historic one-room schoolhouse, were not contaminated by the assessments of television analysts.</p>
        <p>''I don't want these people to be influenced and say, 'Oh, that Jeff Greenfield is a very smart guy,' '' Mr. Blitzer said.</p>
        <p>The decision was made to turn off the volume on the television after the debate ended and before the analysts could weigh in.</p>
        <p>The participants, jittery at first, clutched pens and pads and took pages and pages of notes during the debate. As the cameras prepared to beam them to the nation, they fell utterly silent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blitzer's first on-air question was, ''Tell me who you think won the debate.'' When the anchor mentioned Mr. Gore, 14 hands went up; 3 went up for Mr. Bush. Mr. Blitzer did not mention the count, and today Mr. Traugott, the Michigan professor, applauded the absence of any such tally on the air. Asking for a show of hands, Mr. Traugott said, was an acceptable way to stimulate discussion. The polling expert's verdict:  ''I'd say they were clean last night.''</p>
        <p>The participants seemed pleased, too. Adriana Valdes Vlasic, a legal-aid lawyer, said the experience had taught her a thing or two about how she might better assess candidates in the future. Perhaps through a neighborhood focus group.</p>
        <p>''I think maybe in the future my husband and I should hold a gathering in our home,'' she said, ''and watch the debate that way.''</p>
