        <p>Delta Air Lines plans to demolish the former Pan Am Worldport, built as New York's gateway to the jet age, to greatly expand its presence at Kennedy International Airport, more than tripling the number of its daily flights there by 2005.</p>
        <p>Delta announced yesterday that it would build 10 new gates at the far end of Terminal 2, which was constructed in 1961 for Northwest Airlines, and add 26 gates to the vast International Air Terminal, Terminal 4, that is now under construction. Delta's $1.6 billion project would be completed in 2004.</p>
        <p>To create a pedestrian and baggage bridge between the buildings, Delta would tear down Terminal 3, the 40-year-old Worldport, whose umbrellalike roof once made it the most distinctive terminal at Kennedy after Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. Flight Center.</p>
        <p>Demolition of the Worldport would clearly mark the end of the first-generation of buildings that made up ''Terminal City,'' developed in the 1950's and 60's to serve the  fledgling jet set.</p>
        <p>The pride of New York in its days as Idlewild, but long since the bane of world travelers, the airport was hobbled by a plan in which each airline had its own distinct terminal or ticketing area, most of them too small to accommodate the jumbo jets that arrived in the 1970's comfortably.</p>
        <p>After years of failed promises, the airport began undergoing an incremental transformation in the mid-90's that has sometimes compounded the misery of travel with construction barricades, rerouted traffic and makeshift quarters.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, out of this jumble, a different Kennedy has begun to emerge: one with sleekly spacious terminals, more stores and longer concourses, all to be linked by a light-rail system called AirTrain, whose concrete outlines, in the form of an elevated guideway, are now visible.</p>
        <p>Delta's expansion project was announced yesterday by Gov. George E. Pataki and Leo F. Mullin, the chairman and chief executive of the airline.</p>
        <p>The governor called it a ''capstone'' of the $9 billion makeover of Kennedy, one that would create 6,000 permanent jobs and signal to the aviation industry that ''New York has re-emerged as a home for aviation.''</p>
        <p>The Delta proposal has to be reviewed and approved by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs Kennedy under a longterm lease from New York City.</p>
        <p>Last month, 57 Delta airliners took off daily from Kennedy for 43 cities.</p>
        <p>A year after completion of the terminal expansion, in 2005, the airline estimates, it would send out 175 flights daily.</p>
        <p>The airline's domestic flights would operate from Terminal 2, which would grow to 20 gates from 10 gates. International flights would operate from an expanded concourse at the International Air Terminal, No. 4, the first phase of which is to be completed next May.</p>
        <p>It is being developed privately by a consortium of Schiphol USA, an affiliate of the company that runs the Amsterdam airport; the LCOR Inc. development company and Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>Terminal 4 was designed from the outset to be expanded in modular fashion, said David Sigman, the development general manager for the consortium, which has been negotiating with Delta for about two years.</p>
        <p>Construction, renovation and expansion projects are occurring all around the airport.</p>
        <p>The AirTrain system, which is to open in 2002, will connect the airport to the Long Island Rail Road and subway in Jamaica, Queens, and to the subway in Howard Beach, Queens.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Port Authority board approved the construction of a new United Airlines terminal on part of the site occupied by Saarinen's T.W.A. building, Terminal 5, which is protected as a city landmark.</p>
        <p>That project will be made possible by the construction of a two-level roadway between the new United terminal and the existing Saarinen building, said Barry Abramowitz, the assistant director of the aviation capital program at the Port Authority. A new garage will be constructed in front of Terminal 5.</p>
        <p>The authority board has also authorized design work for the reconstruction of Terminal 6, originally the National Airlines Sundrome, now used by United and JetBlue.</p>
        <p>An expansion of the British Airways terminal, No. 7, is to be completed next year.</p>
        <p>American Airlines began the ground work earlier this year for its colossal new building, Terminal 8, which will have 57 gates and the first midfield concourse at Kennedy, reached by an underground tunnel. It is to be finished in 2006.</p>
        <p>Terminal 1, built by Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Lufthansa, opened in 1998.</p>
        <p>All this activity has left the older buildings looking ever more outdated.</p>
        <p>The $12 million Worldport was designed by Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy &amp; Stratton and built by Pan American World Airways in 1960. Boeing 707's, those white-hulled, globe-girdling jetliners that Pan Am called ''clippers,'' could nose in under the four-acre elliptical concrete canopy that covered the building, hung on spidery cables that resembled those of a suspension bridge.</p>
        <p>''It was the ultimate in jet-setting cool,'' said Barnaby Conrad III, author of ''Pan Am: An Aviation Legend'' (Woodford Press, 2000), an illustrated history.</p>
        <p>''At its peak in the 1960's, Pan Am was the greatest airline in the world,'' Mr. Conrad said yesterday. ''The blue globe logo was the icon of America's imagination, power and global destiny. If you could dream of a faraway place, Pan Am could get you there. For Americans, the Worldport was the gateway to the world.''</p>
