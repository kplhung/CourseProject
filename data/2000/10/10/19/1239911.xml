        <p>A Vine of Plenty</p>
        <p>Q. Last spring, I planted Dutchman's-pipe and morning glories for an instant privacy screen. Growth was vigorous beyond expectations. I realize that they are completely intertwined with each other and that only the Dutchman's-pipe is a perennial. Should I pull up the morning glories now? Cut back everything next spring?</p>

        <p>A Vine of Plenty</p>
        <p>Q. Last spring, I planted Dutchman's-pipe and morning glories for an instant privacy screen. Growth was vigorous beyond expectations. I realize that they are completely intertwined with each other and that only the Dutchman's-pipe is a perennial. Should I pull up the morning glories now? Cut back everything next spring?</p>
        <p>A. The standard advice on Dutchman's-pipe is to prune it in early spring, but if you are the tidy type, you don't have to wait that long. Just cut everything to the ground as soon as the vine goes dormant, which will probably happen sometime in November. You won't have to look at a bunch of brown stems, and the Dutchman's-pipe, which is not so much perennial as immortal, will have less of a head start next year.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, you could just do nothing. Giving the Dutchman's-pipe a head start on next year obviously has advantages in the privacy department, and though a lacework of brown stems is less lovely than a wall of green, it does offer some winter protection from prying eyes.</p>
        <p>There is also a third way. Put up with the mess until February; by that time, most of the morning glory will have rotted away. Cut the Dutchman's-pipe back to about two feet from the ground. When it resumes growth in late spring, it will branch more heavily, thus making a denser covering.</p>
        <p>The advantage here is that those late-winter prunings are wonderful in the vase. The long, dark, fancifully curled bare stems add interest to flower arrangements, and they can also be forced into graceful and delicate growth. Put the cuttings in a jar of cool water and put them in a cool area, away from bright sun. Change the water every few days. After two or three weeks, the buds will swell into perfect green hearts, summer leaves in miniature.</p>
        <p>Sometimes that's it, but with luck, two weeks or so after the leaves, there will be blossoms, the jazzy little brown and green saxophones for which the plant is named.</p>
        <p>Saving Bean Seeds</p>
        <p>Q. This year we grew Provider bush beans. As we were pulling up the plants while cleaning up the garden, I noticed several very fat pods that had been overlooked. The beans inside look almost like dry beans, but they are still soft. Can I dry them and save them for seed?</p>
        <p>A. The basic criteria have been met: Provider is not a hybrid (hybrids don't come true from seed). And since you grew only the one kind, you've avoided the small chance it could cross with a neighboring variety. As long as the beans are fully mature and have not been damaged by frost, you can save them for seed.</p>
        <p>But before you start what could become a long-term relationship, you might want to re-evaluate your intended. Though Provider is popular, early, reliable and prolific, it isn't particularly tasty.</p>
        <p>More flavorful alternatives, including Bush Blue Lake, Kentucky Wonder (bush) and Tendergreen Improved, are easy to find in garden stores. Specialty catalogs offer dozens of others, each more interesting and delicious than the last.</p>
        <p>That said, if you're keen on Provider, by all means proceed. Hang the whole plants upside down in a warm, dry place. When the pods are crisp, remove the beans. If they're wrinkled, put everything in the compost bin and add bean seeds to the shopping list.</p>
        <p>If the beans are plump, smooth and hard enough to break when hit with a hammer, you're in business. Pack them in airtight jars and freeze for a week, to kill any lurking bean weevils, then let the jars return to room temperature unopened. Store in a dark, cool, dry place.</p>
