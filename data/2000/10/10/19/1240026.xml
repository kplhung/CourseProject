        <p>Keith Van Horn heard the sickening, telltale pop. As he lay on the court and pain coursed through his lower left leg, he was sure.</p>
        <p>In the second quarter in Orlando on Tuesday night, Van Horn, the New Jersey Nets forward, landed awkwardly after going up for an offensive rebound and fractured his left fibula in two places.</p>
        <p>Tonight, before the Nets lost their third straight preseason game, 99-90, to the Charlotte Hornets, Van Horn was seated somberly in the visiting locker room at the Charlotte Coliseum with his left leg in a hard cast, crutches on the ground next to him. He will be out four to six weeks, and will probably miss the first month of the Nets' regular season, which begins Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>Van Horn was too distraught to speak to reporters on Tuesday night. But this morning in Charlotte, he had a second X-ray that confirmed what he had found out Tuesday night in Orlando: he had nothing worse than a broken bone. After a day of reflection, Van Horn was much calmer in describing his injury; his frustration had turned into a resignation that has become commonplace in the Nets' injury-ravaged recent history.</p>
        <p>''This definitely isn't as bad as it could have been,'' Van Horn said. ''It's something that I might miss the first few weeks of the season. But it's a long season, as we all know. The first month is important, but it doesn't make or break the season.''</p>
        <p>Last year, when shooting guard Kerry Kittles missed all but two games in November while recovering from a knee injury, the Nets started out 2-13.</p>
        <p>Nets Coach Byron Scott took comfort that Van Horn's injury was not more serious. ''I'm pretty happy that he'll only be out four to six weeks, instead of three to four months,'' Scott said today. ''I told Keith this morning that sometime in December we'll look back at this and be laughing. All the guys will be healthy and we'll be together and we'll be playing the way we're capable of playing.''</p>
        <p>For now, the Nets' roster is depleted by five key players. And that does not count Jayson Williams, who retired before the season because of complications from a broken leg he sustained in April 1999. Tonight, Kendall Gill, the starting shooting guard, sat out his second straight game with a scratched left cornea. He hopes to play against the New York Knicks next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>With forward Jamie Feick recovering from surgery on his left Achilles' tendon that will probably sideline him until January, and with the backup shooting guard Lucious Harris recovering from hernia surgery that will keep him out until December, the Nets have had to shuffle their personnel. Johnny Newman, the veteran small forward, started alongside the rookie power forward Kenyon Martin tonight. Neither was a factor. Martin scored 4 points and had 5 rebounds and Newman had only 3 points.</p>
        <p>For the second straight game, the rookie free agent Stephen Jackson led the team in scoring, with 23 points. Without Van Horn,  Aaron Williams, a 6-foot-9-inch free-agent forward, will play more minutes, and in a team-high 31 minutes tonight, he had 13 points and 7 rebounds. Because of Van Horn's injury, the quick development of Martin becomes more urgent. Martin recovered from a broken right fibula he sustained in March while playing for the University of Cincinnati. ''I don't wish that on anybody,'' Martin said. ''When I saw him go down, I was like, 'No, this can't be.' ''</p>
        <p>Van Horn said he could not watch replays immediately after he was hurt, but he had since seen a tape on ESPN that showed his left foot might have caught the edge of Bo Outlaw's foot. The injury was worse than the ankle sprain Van Horn sustained in a preseason game in 1997, his rookie year. He missed the first 17 games of that season before coming back to lead the Nets in scoring and earn a selection to the All-Rookie team.</p>
        <p>The Nets will start the season with four players out for at least the first month. Nets General Manager John Nash said he had spoken today with Rod Thorn, the team's president, about applying for an injury exception, which allows four players to be on the injured list at one time instead of three.</p>
        <p>As for replacing Van Horn with a trade or free-agent pickup, Nash said: ''You don't find a player of Keith Van Horn's caliber available. What you hope to do is find a way to bridge. But we are not going to be without the services of Keith for probably more than a month. I'm not sure if it behooves us to overreact.''</p>
