        <p>DISOBEDIENCE  By Jane Hamilton  273 pages. Doubleday. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Jane Hamilton's new novel describes what happens after 17-year-old Henry Shaw accidentally invades the e-mail of his mother, Beth, and discovers that she has a second life parallel to the one she spends with her family. Under the vixenish e-moniker Liza38, 38-year-old Beth is locked in a damply literary correspondence with a man named Richard Polloco. ''Hello my screech owl, my foghorn on a misty night, my kettle rattling on the stove, my pot of spilled India ink, my mail-order Hatteras hammock, webbed with dew on a damp fall morning,'' Polloco has written to Henry's mother, in an early message that the son intercepts. Beth in turn addresses her Ukrainian-born lover as ''Dear Kreplach'' in another dispatch.</p>
        <p>It's characteristic of the earnest, intense ''Disobedience'' to have Henry think that it is impossible to resist a man who writes that way. And the book makes another of Polloco's virtues the fact that he lives in a replica of Abraham Lincoln's birthplace, complete with checked pillows, gingham curtains and straw hats hanging from hooks near the log cabin door. In writing that is rich as syrup, Ms. Hamilton ascribes such a middle-aged, womanly sensibility to her characters (Henry uses phrases like ''gussied up'' and describes the ''tang'' of frying butter) that a certain degree of preciousness colors all of the proceedings here. When Henry, sounding uncharacteristically irreverent, describes Beth's misbehavior as ''some great big Anna Karenina jumps off the bridges of Madison County sort of thing,'' he isn't entirely off the mark.</p>
        <p>Unlike Ms. Hamilton's novel ''A Map of the World,'' in which the accidental drowning of a child has cataclysmic consequences for the book's heroine, ''Disobedience'' is not openly eventful. Yet it manages to encompass a wide range of psychological and thematic terrain. One of the book's concerns is the kind of transgression described by its title; another is history, with Henry's father and younger sister piquantly caught up in the idea of re-enacting the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Hamilton sometimes strains to fuse these two strains (''You could say that the Civil War was nothing more than a marriage spat, the thing in the middle of the long years together, the midlife crisis followed by forgiveness, habitual bickering, old age and amnesia''), she does create fine-tuned echoes and reverberations within the peculiar history of the Shaws. Indeed, within the sort of kaffeeklatsch book club that holds meetings in the Shaws' living room, there will be much to discuss about the haunting if arbitrary way that Ms. Hamilton makes past and present, love and war, loyalty and treachery all intersect.</p>
        <p>The Shaws are a family of strong, eclectic interests, as witnessed by the choice of the younger child, Elvira, to attend a wedding dressed in a First Maine Artillery uniform complete with saber (she thinks of herself as Elviron at such times) or Beth's career as a pianist versed in folk traditions like English clog dancing. Until the point at which the story begins, Henry has perhaps allowed himself to think that these insular tastes are enough to bind them together. But when he discovers his mother's secret and realizes that at least part of what she yearns for is a life free from family domesticity, he falls into a well-described morass of anger and frustration. ''I was 17 and did not know very much,'' he explains, ''although I had the weight of the world on my shoulders. I thought that if I'd been a pet, I would have barked and barked at my mistress's heels, trying to keep her from drinking the poisoned water, keeping her from danger. In those days my heart, I guess it was, sank more or less every day. I was no longer a boy, not yet a man, nowhere near as industrious as a dog. I had nothing in me then but useless sorrow.''</p>
        <p>That lovely, resonant passage captures Ms. Hamilton at her brooding best. And there is much writing of similar gravity and beauty here. But ''Disobedience'' is also a miniaturist's story, gripped by inertia and tightly focused on the Shaws' particular forms of restlessness. Without the wonderfully quirky, single-minded details of Elvira's Civil War obsession (''Elvira made hardtack when it was her turn to provide the snack''), and without the convenient parallel of a first love for Henry just as his mother's heart goes astray, the book's central crisis seems thin and even treacly. ''Richard gives me exactly what I need, conversation and whimsy and passion and attention,'' Beth tells a friend, sounding an awful lot like a personals ad in a literary magazine.</p>
        <p>When ''Disobedience'' concentrates on Henry's stifled fury and on his efforts to make sense of love and loyalty in the face of his mother's rebel streak, this keenly wrought but unfocused book comes closest to striking a raw nerve. Henry thinks bitterly of his mother as ''alone in this world if you don't count her two offspring and perfectly good husband.'' He sees how his own passions are inextricably linked with hers.  And he becomes this book's true author as he exerts the strength that finally means most here, the redeeming power of an artist's imagination.</p>
        <p>''To picture my mother a lover,'' he says, ''I had at first to break her in my mind's eye, hold her over my knee, like a stick, bust her in two. When that was done, when I had changed her like that, I could see her in a different way. I could put her through the motions like a jointed puppet, all dancy in the limbs, loose, nothing to hold her up but me.''</p>
