        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Mars and Venus, Online'' (Oct. 12), about the stereotypes perpetuated by the use of male and female computer voices, was interesting. But even though the article said many people thought male voices were best for conveying authoritative information, I seem to remember that the Air Force preferred a cool female voice for pilots' warning messages. So maybe there's more to this story.</p>
