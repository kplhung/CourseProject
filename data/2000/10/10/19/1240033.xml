        <p>It is the unavoidable subtext of the World Series, a memory bubbling just under the surface. The Hall of Fame-bound pitcher fires a fastball. The Hall of Fame-bound catcher, struck on the emblem of his helmet, crumbles to the ground. The Yankees' Roger Clemens will face the Mets' Mike Piazza again very soon.</p>
        <p>''I think we all have something we'd like to do about that,'' said Mets reliever Turk Wendell. ''I don't know, did Roger ever say he was sorry?''</p>
        <p>The Mets will not get an apology from Clemens, who has said he never tried to hit Piazza on purpose. Piazza has not forgotten, and neither have his teammates, who worked out at Shea Stadium yesterday in preparation for Game 1 of the World Series on Saturday at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>In July, the day after he was hit, Piazza said he had lost respect for Clemens because he believed Clemens threw at his head. Piazza is doing his best to play down that incident now, but he knew he would be deluged with questions at the workout.</p>
        <p>''I put it behind me,'' Piazza said. ''I think it's irrelevant, really, what my feelings are. My feelings are to win the games. There've been a lot of guys, personally, you either agree with or disagree with. That's irrelevant to trying to do my job. That's the approach you have to take. You have to be a professional. I said what I said and I moved on. It's already history.''</p>
        <p>There is little history of beanballs in the World Series, at least since 1980, when George Brett's Kansas City Royals were interrupted on their way to pulling even with the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the 1980 World Series. In the fourth inning that day, Dickie Noles, a brash 23-year-old reliever, knocked Brett to the ground with perhaps the most famous brushback pitch in Series history. Noles was upset at how the Royals had celebrated their early lead that day. He was ahead in the count on the future Hall of Famer, 0-2, and did not appreciate the time it took Brett to return to the batter's box. Noles needed to back Brett off the plate, and he did much more than that.</p>
        <p>''I made my decision at that point,'' Noles said this week, from his home in Aston, Pa. ''This is the guy I'm going to undress.''</p>
        <p>The Kansas City fans were silent for a moment, their hero sprawled on the ground. Then they let loose with the loudest booing Noles had ever heard. Noles received a warning and struck out Brett when the game resumed, but the Royals never threw at a Phillies player. They also never won again in that series.</p>
        <p>''George wanted to come up against me again and hit one off my face,'' said Noles, who now works in the Phillies' employee-assistance program. ''He never got a chance to hit off me again until I got traded to the American League three years later.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, who is 7 for 12 with three homers in his interleague confrontations with Clemens, gets his chance just three months later. Yesterday, he praised Clemens as a ''formidable pitcher,'' and asserted that he will ''definitely have a clear mind'' in the batter's box, just as he did in his first at-bat after being beaned by Pedro Martinez in an interleague game with Boston several years ago.</p>
        <p>After the waves of reporters had subsided yesterday, Piazza was asked if he remembered the Noles-Brett incident, the stuff of legend in the Philadelphia area, where Piazza grew up. Piazza recalled it vaguely. Did the Royals retaliate, he asked? What was the impact of the pitch?</p>
        <p>When told that some people credit the pitch with shifting the momentum of that series, Piazza was skeptical. If the Royals had gone on to win, he said, people would have probably said that Noles was foolish to fire them up.</p>
        <p>Piazza's point was that Clemens's pitch would probably have no impact on this World Series. The chances of the incident mushrooming were highest the next night, July 9, when the Yankees and Mets met for the final time in the regular season, and the Mets won an uneventful 2-0 game behind the pitching of Mike Hampton. The chances of a Clemens-inpired brawl in October would seem to be slimmer than they were in July.</p>
        <p>In fact, even as hitters have become more sensitive to pitches up and in, there has not been a memorable October beanball-type incident in the 20 years since Noles dusted Brett.</p>
        <p>But the Mets nearly had one on Monday night, when the St. Louis right-hander Dave Veres beaned Mets center fielder Jay Payton with two outs in the eighth inning of the final game of the National League Championship Series. Payton bolted up from the ground and stalked toward Veres, but two steps into his march, Payton said, he knew he would not throw a punch. Too much is at stake.</p>
        <p>Clemens will probably not pitch at Shea Stadium in the World Series. The Yankees have not announced their rotation, but he seems very likely to start Games 2 and 6 at Yankee Stadium, where the designated hitter will be in effect and he will not have to bat. But his presence will heighten the tension, and every pitch he throws will have more meaning attached to it because of recent history.</p>
        <p>When Piazza was hit in July, Mets pitcher Glendon Rusch plunked Tino Martinez in the rear end the next inning. Neither team spilled onto the field, no brawling took place. Mets reliever Dennis Cook said he did not expect further retaliation in the World Series, but whatever the situation, Cook said, the Mets would continue to protect their marquee player.</p>
        <p>''Circumstances sometimes arise,'' Cook said. ''Obviously, if Piazza gets hit in the head, it doesn't matter what time of year it is. I just think you have to protect your big guys, and the guys on the other side would say the same thing.''</p>
        <p>As for Wendell, he said he was disappointed Clemens is not pitching at Shea, where he would have to bat.</p>
        <p>''This whole thing of not pitching him at Shea Stadium -- why not?'' Wendell said. ''Is he afraid he's going to get hit or something? It would show me a lot if he wanted to pitch here. It would show me he's not afraid.''</p>
        <p>Wendell said there has been no talk about Clemens in the clubhouse, except when reporters bring him up. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, who criticized Clemens sharply in July, said ''Who cares?'' yesterday, before opening up a bit.</p>
        <p>''If anybody thinks it's the biggest thing going on here, that's inaccurate,'' Valentine said. ''And if anybody thinks it's forgotten totally, that's also inaccurate. It's part and parcel of what our season's been about.''</p>
        <p>But is that chapter of the season over, or will the Mets and Yankees be grappling on the Bronx green this weekend? If a brawl did not happen in 1980, it will probably not happen now.</p>
        <p>''Thank God we didn't have one,'' Noles said. ''And I don't think there's going to be one this year, either.''</p>
