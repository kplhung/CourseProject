        <p>The Senate today overwhelmingly approved a bill easing nearly four decades of sanctions on the sale of food to Cuba, all but assuring the measure will become law.</p>
        <p>But in doing so, the lawmakers added restrictions that will make it difficult, perhaps impossible, for food shipments to be made to Cuba in the near future, many farmers, lobbyists and trade group officials said of the 86-to-8 vote.</p>
        <p>Politically powerful agricultural interests, eyeing a potential market, pressed hard for the removal of sanctions against food sales. But when it came to altering this abiding vestige of the cold war in an election year, opponents pushed back.</p>
        <p>Anti-Castro Cuban-Americans in Florida, a hotly contested state in the presidential election, were able to win new restrictions on travel to Cuba and prohibitions on United States government credit and private financing for any sales.</p>
        <p>''Wait till these farmers who think that they were given a great new market to deal in, wait till they try to get a visa to go there or try to get financing, they're going to be furious,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, who voted for the bill.</p>
        <p>The easing of sanctions passed by the Senate today was contained in a $78 billion agriculture spending bill approved by the House on Oct. 11.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has indicated that he will sign the bill, despite reservations over language he views as infringing on executive authority by barring a president from imposing sanctions on food and medicine without Congress's permission.</p>
        <p>Cuban government officials have been sharply critical of the legislation, portraying it as a missed opportunity and stating flatly that Cuba has no plans to buy food from the United States.</p>
        <p>In Havana today, President Fidel Castro led a large protest against the bill, which he called insulting.  ''They have included a load of restrictions which are humiliating for the country, and make it impossible in practice,'' Mr. Castro said before the demonstration. [Page A9.]</p>
        <p>Indicative of the political sensitivity of the issue, the campaign of Vice President Al Gore had no immediate comment on today's vote, and his rival, Governor George W. Bush, condemned the Senate action. ''Governor Bush opposes changing the sanctions against Cuba until Fidel Castro or the Cuban government allow free elections, free speech and freedom for political prisoners,'' said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The agriculture bill includes a measure to allow pharmacies and wholesalers to reimport cheaply priced American-made prescription drugs that had been exported, with certain restrictions.</p>
        <p>In addition to the provision on Cuba, the bill permits the sale of food and medicine to Iran, Sudan, Libya and North Korea, transactions that are in large part already permitted. Those countries may request United States government credits and private financing, conditional on a presidential waiver.</p>
        <p>Cuba may not ask for such a waiver, but farmers and agribusiness officials nonetheless described the bill as ''a crack in the door,'' in the words of Van Yeutter of Cargill Inc., a large commodities company.</p>
        <p>Advocates of more open trade with Cuba foresee returning to the issue next year when the tricky politics of the presidential campaign have passed.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you'll have the political dynamic with Florida and the Cuban-American community and their basic impact,'' said Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who strongly supports easing sanctions. ''You're talking about 7 percent of the electorate in a state that has very close elections for the House, the Senate and the presidency.''</p>
        <p>The United States government first imposed a ban on trade with Cuba in 1962, after the Communist government seized more than 6,000 American-owned properties. While Cuba is a small market -- 11.2 million people -- its nearness to the United States and the fact it imports most of its food makes it an enticing market for American farmers.</p>
        <p>Choosing their words carefully, farmers -- along with most Democrats and some farm-state Republicans -- said they would have much preferred the Senate's original version of the bill. That version lifted sanctions on food and medicine outright and received a large bipartisan vote in the Senate. A similar bill also was initially approved by wide margins in the House.</p>
        <p>But House Republican leaders succeeded in weakening the final bill, drafted by Representative George Nethercutt, a Washington Republican, at the behest of two Republican Cuban-American lawmakers from Florida. The two lawmakers -- Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen -- claimed victory on the issue.</p>
        <p>Under the compromise in Congress, Cuba would be barred from receiving United States government credit and private financing to buy food from American farmers. Instead, Cuba, a considerable credit risk, must either persuade a foreign bank to lend it money or pay cash.  ''The fact of the matter is it's going to be a difficult road in putting together business,'' Mr. Yeutter said. ''Financing is a big issue. The country doesn't have much money today.''</p>
        <p>Cuba withdrew from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the 1960's and so is barred from any financing from them. And while Cuba now imports a number of goods from France, Canada, China, Mexico, Argentina and other countries, the sales are heavily subsidized.</p>
        <p>''Which banks will want to take the risk of the Cubans defaulting?'' asked Wayne Hammon, director of government relations for the National Association of Wheat Growers.</p>
