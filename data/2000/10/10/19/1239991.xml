      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In declaring in a report today that Hillary Rodham Clinton gave ''factually false'' sworn testimony minimizing her role in the firing of employees of the White House travel office, the independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, released segments of grand jury testimony and other sworn statements by Mrs. Clinton and others.</p>
        <p>The report found ''overwhelming evidence that she in fact did have a role in the decision to fire the employees,'' through her contacts with David Watkins, a senior White House aide, and Thomas F. McLarty III, the White House chief of staff, who was known as Mack.</p>
        <p>From Mr. Watkins</p>
        <p>In testimony before a federal grand jury on Feb. 28, 1995, Mr. Watkins was asked: ''Did Mrs. Clinton ever tell you that officials in the White House travel office should be fired?''</p>
        <p>He answered: ''She said, 'Well, you know, we need to have our people in there.' She said, 'I have talked to many people that have been in the White House before, and there are just too many people. If you don't have your own people in -- there are too many leftovers that can create and cause us problems.' ''</p>
        <p>From Mr. McLarty</p>
        <p>In grand jury testimony on April 25, 1995, Mr. McLarty was asked if he had ever discussed the travel office staff with Mrs. Clinton. He replied:</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Clinton did visit with me about the matter for about five minutes.''</p>
        <p>''Once she understood that I had been apprised of this situation and was going to fully evaluate it, that was the basic point of her comments about the travel office, simply to make sure I was aware of what she felt was a situation that certainly needed to be carefully reviewed and probably changed.''</p>
        <p>From Mrs. Clinton</p>
        <p>In a sworn deposition by the independent counsel's office on July 22, 1995, Mrs. Clinton was asked who decided to fire the employees.</p>
        <p>She answered, ''The best I know is David Watkins and Mack McLarty, I assume, based upon what I have learned since and read in the newspapers.''</p>
        <p>Asked if she had any role in the firings, she replied: ''No, I did not.''</p>
        <p>Asked if she had ''any input with either Mr. McLarty or Mr. Watkins as to that decision,'' she replied: ''I don't believe I did, no.''</p>
