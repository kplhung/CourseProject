        <p>Vin and Sprit, Swedish state-owned company, has joined forces with Bacardi International Ltd and Brown-Forman Corp to bid for liquor business of Seagram Co; Vin and Sprit is prepared to contribute $1 billion in cash to a bid that could exceed $7 billion (M)</p>

        <p>In a move that promises to redefine what had largely been considered a two-horse race, Vin and Sprit, the Swedish state-owned company that owns the rights to the Absolut vodka brand, has joined forces with Bacardi International Ltd. and the Brown-Forman Corporation to bid for the drinks business of the Seagram Company, people close to the companies said today.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Vin and Sprit is prepared to contribute $1 billion in cash to a bid that could exceed $7 billion, a person close to the company said. Vin and Sprit's financial muscle -- as a wholly owned entity of the Swedish government, its contribution could grow -- lends credibility to the Bacardi-Brown-Forman partnership, which analysts had criticized as a lightweight compared with the likes of Allied Domecq P.L.C., the British beverage conglomerate, and Diageo P.L.C. of Britain, which has paired with Pernod Ricard S.A. of France.</p>
        <p>Up until now, it had been unclear how Bacardi and Brown-Forman could assemble the money needed to make a bid for the Seagram collection of brands that includes Chivas Regal scotch and Martell Cognac. Vivendi, the French media conglomerate that bought Seagram, is selling the liquor and keeping Seagram's Universal film, music and entertainment businesses.</p>
        <p>Bacardi, the rum maker based in Bermuda, shied away from an initial public offering last year. Brown-Forman, the company based in Louisville, Ky., that owns the Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort brands, is controlled by members of the co-founding Brown family.</p>
        <p>The current agreement between Vin and Sprit and its partners excludes the Absolut rights, which the Swedish company is retaining in the event its bid for Seagram's drinks business fails. If that happened, Vin and Sprit could cut a new deal to license the vodka brand.</p>
        <p>''By splitting up the rights to Absolut, you're not at the whim of any one group's decision,'' said the executive close to Vin and Sprit.</p>
        <p>So far Allied Domecq is the only company to bid alone. While its independence gives it the freedom to negotiate unhampered, that independence could turn into a liability should the price of the deal escalate, starting a bidding war.</p>
        <p>''In order to get this deal done, partnerships need to form,'' said one person involved in the process who insisted on anonymity. ''The market hasn't focused on how difficult it is for Allied to do this deal alone.''</p>
        <p>Vivendi, which intends to use the proceeds of the Seagram sale to pay down debt, is likely to want cash.</p>
        <p>Yet, financing a deal of this size by borrowing could hurt Allied Domecq. Its interest coverage ratio, a calculation of a company's ability to make debt payments, could weaken to 2.7, compared with the current level of 5.8, according to the estimates of Graeme Eadie, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. Investors typically prefer that an interest coverage ratio exceed 3.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Diageo, in addition to having a partner in Pernod Ricard that is willing to shoulder some of the financial burden, is cash rich with about $:1 billion, or about $1.41 billion at current exchange rates, and has  relatively low debt.</p>
