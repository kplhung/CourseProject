        <p>The Museum of Modern Art, which is to close in the summer of 2002 for a full architectural overhaul, unveiled the design for its temporary home in Long Island City, Queens, yesterday.</p>
        <p>How long the museum will display its artworks at the provisional site, a former Swingline stapler factory, depends on how long it takes to finish  its Midtown Manhattan renovation, designed by the Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi. That project, which won unanimous approval yesterday from the City Planning Commission, is scheduled to be completed in late 2004 or early 2005.</p>
        <p>During the intervening years, the former factory will become a mini-museum, a kind of architectural understudy where part of the permanent collection will be displayed and temporary exhibitions housed. At 45-20 33rd Street, off Queens Boulevard, it is just outside the 33rd Street subway stop on the No. 7 line.</p>
        <p>The Queens building is to open in the summer of 2002 with an exhibition of some of the Modern's best-known masterworks. Other shows planned include a major Matisse-Picasso show that is to run from mid-February 2003 through May of that year.</p>
        <p>Designed by the Los Angeles architect Michael Maltzan, the Queens building will provide 25,000 square feet of temporary galleries. Most of it will be almost raw warehouse space, with 20-foot ceilings and walls that will be rearranged on an exhibition-by-exhibition basis. The columns of the original factory will remain as echoes of the building's former life.</p>
        <p>A mezzanine with a cafe and a gift shop will open out onto an airy foyer with 22-foot ceilings and a long, leisurely S-shaped ramp leading from the street entrance to the building's ticket booth.</p>
        <p>But many visitors' first glimpse of the building will be a giant rooftop  ''MoMA'' sign visible from the elevated No. 7 train as it nears the 33rd Street station from Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''From the No. 7 train, the roof is the first facade,'' said Mr. Maltzan. ''I was trying to create a museum space that is iconographically very different, very modern, that is not a destination but a threshold where the movement of the visitor doesn't stop until you come up to the art itself.''</p>
        <p>Once out of the subway station, visitors will cross Queens Boulevard and walk under a 150-foot-long canopy that will run above the sidewalk, leading to the temporary museum's entrance on 33rd Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maltzan, 40, a Long Island native who was formerly a senior associate with the firm of the Los Angeles architect Frank O. Gehry, said he wanted the building to reflect what he called the ''middle landscape'' between the urban and the suburban.</p>
        <p>''I was trying to walk a fine line between the anonymous architecture of the area and the clear identity of the museum,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Modern's expansion project,  the most ambitious by a New York museum in decades, will cost $650 million, 10 percent of it provided by the city.</p>
        <p>The museum estimates the cost of the Swingline building conversion, including its purchase price, at $28.7 million.</p>
        <p>When the artworks return to 53rd Street, the Swingline building will become a study and conservation center, office space and a storehouse for artworks now stored around the city.</p>
