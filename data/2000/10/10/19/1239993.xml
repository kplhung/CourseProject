        <p>POOR Bobby Valentine, the emperor with no contract, who now must manage against a man even George Steinbrenner would dare not fire.</p>
        <p>''It's only a distraction when I have to answer questions,'' Valentine said last week regarding his uncertain status for next season, one day before a newspaper reported that the Mets were keeping a recruitment eye on the vanquished Dusty Baker.</p>
        <p>This also sounded like a potential distraction, though, not insignificantly, it set off another news media round of poor Bobby valentines. How foolish of the Mets to complicate their manager's life at a time he needs to be planning the undressing of the Yankees' Joe Torre, in the manner he dusted the Giants' Baker and the genius La Russa.</p>
        <p>A funny thing has happened to Valentine on the way to what many people as recently as September still believed could be a messy and self-destructive end to his time in New York. He has steered the Mets to the World Series, a Subway Series, when managerial vacancy signs are hanging all around the major leagues. In terms of negotiating leverage, that means poor Valentine is actually Moses on a mountain, lineup card in one hand, tablet in the other. But as the Mets' owners shift uneasily while wondering how much they are going to be held up for, as they sensibly lay out an alternate plan, guess what? Valentine, for once in his life, gets to be cast as the victim, too.</p>
        <p>The Mets made a business decision last winter to withhold contract extensions for Valentine and their general manager, Steve Phillips. There was certainly a sound argument to be made that both had already earned more years, but the owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, apparently decided that performance this season was going to determine their futures. Fair enough. Now, on as grand a sports stage as there is, Valentine has made the right moves and the fortuitous moves. Now he is called brilliant for merely replacing his injured right fielder, Derek Bell, with Timo Perez.</p>
        <p>That is how the game of credit and blame is played, and will continue to be as Valentine leads his Mets into the Valley of Darkness, the Bronx, N.Y., against the imperious Yankees of 25 World Series championships to the Mets'</p>
        <p>lonely two.</p>
        <p>It is just baseball, the best of both leagues, Valentine kept saying yesterday. It is nothing for the Mets to approach with awe, or fear.</p>
        <p>''It's not the first time we've gone there,'' Valentine said. ''We've been there for interleague play. We've taken the bus rides, had the motorcade, heard the national anthem.''</p>
        <p>''We know we deserve to be there,'' Mike Piazza said. ''It's not David against Goliath.''</p>
        <p>On the field, it is anything but that. With their left-handers Mike Hampton and Al Leiter likely to throw this weekend in Yankee Stadium, with Perez setting tables and their big hitters clearing them, the Mets are the hotter, and maybe the better, team. But Valentine admitted that for the Yankees, going for a threepeat and their fourth title in five years, the World Series must by now feel like a backyard catch.</p>
        <p>''They're so experienced,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>They come with an attitude that Darryl Hamilton was reminded of recently, as he watched a sports report before the Yankees played Game 5 in Oakland, and a fan was asked if she was nervous.</p>
        <p>''No,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Why not?''</p>
        <p>''Because we're the Yankees,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''And we're still the upstarts,'' Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>The Mets are poor Piazza, hit in the head last July by Roger Clemens. They are Jay Payton of their bargain basement outfield, strolling into the clubhouse yesterday with stitches around the eye from the pitch he took in the helmet the other night. The Mets are Johnny Franco, finally making the Series after 17 major-league seasons. They are the team in the shadow of City Hall that seldom gets the attention of its Yankee-loving Mayor.</p>
        <p>They are Valentine, poor Valentine, who, after 13 years of trying to convince people of how smart he is, finally brings the Series home, but to a divided city that still asks if he rates a contract for next year.</p>
        <p>Well, the good news for Mets' fans is that Valentine remains in the position he's accustomed to, and probably, in his heart of hearts, truly prefers. He remains the feisty and under-appreciated upstart, and that is about the best way for the Mets to go about their business as they head into the bastion of baseball's elite.</p>
        <p>That's the way Mets versus Yankees shapes up, for now. When it's over, if he wins, poor Valentine will be the richest man in town.</p>
