        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have accepted an invitation to share an hour of free time on the Fox television network during which each candidate will tell viewers why he thinks he should be president.</p>
        <p>Network executives said yesterday that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush would each get about a half-hour to plead their cases directly to the network's audience on Oct. 27.</p>
        <p>Fox executives said the candidates would be asked to present videotapes of their addresses at their convenience. The addresses are to be taped in the presence of a Fox executive. They are not to be edited or enhanced.</p>
        <p>Their addresses are scheduled to be shown, in succession, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time and Pacific time, and at 7 p.m. Central time and Mountain time. The political videos will replace the regularly scheduled ''Police Videos.''</p>
        <p>The order in which the addresses will be shown is to be decided by the toss of a coin, said Andrew Butcher, a spokesman for Fox.</p>
