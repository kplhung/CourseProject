        <p>The final of the OKbridge Internet World Championship will be played in Birmingham, Ala., on Nov. 16 as a curtain raiser for the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals. One team, the winner of the Western Hemisphere zone, consists of Jay McKee, Joao Campos, Benito Garozzo, Lea Dupont, Raija and Richard Reisig. This is a cosmopolitan group: Garozzo, who lives in Florida, won many world titles for Italy; Campos has represented Brazil successfully; and Raija Reisig is from Finland. In the semifinal they upset the defending champions headed by Doug Simson, winning by 30 imps.</p>

        <p>The final of the OKbridge Internet World Championship will be played in Birmingham, Ala., on Nov. 16 as a curtain raiser for the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals. One team, the winner of the Western Hemisphere zone, consists of Jay McKee, Joao Campos, Benito Garozzo, Lea Dupont, Raija and Richard Reisig. This is a cosmopolitan group: Garozzo, who lives in Florida, won many world titles for Italy; Campos has represented Brazil successfully; and Raija Reisig is from Finland. In the semifinal they upset the defending champions headed by Doug Simson, winning by 30 imps.</p>
        <p>Representing the rest of the world in the final will be a dark-horse squad from Romania: Catalin Popescu, Dorin Ghergulescu, Alexander Feber, Dorin Petre Musat, Serban Criscota and Marian Radulescu. In the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds they defeated strong teams from Sweden and China. The diagramed deal helped them against the Swedish group.</p>
        <p>As a passed hand, Popescu as East overcalled one spade after hearing his opponents bid the red suits. With such weak spades, that would not be a popular choice. His partner, however, did not take the hint. When North-South struggled up to three no-trump, Feber as West led a heart, a surprising choice: The normal lead of the spade ace with the five to follow would have ensured defeat of the contract. East would have to take an ace as quickly as possible to continue spades.</p>
        <p>The heart lead lost the tempo for the defense. If East had taken his ace and returned a heart, South would have prevailed by winning in dummy and leading spades himself, a small paradox. He would have to guess right on the next heart lead. Not knowing the position, however, East played the jack on the first trick, losing to the queen. The Swedish declarer, Lars Larsson, crossed to the diamond jack and led a club.</p>
        <p>East put up the ace and played his remaining club. South would now have made his game if he had taken the king and played spades, for he would have emerged with five diamond tricks, two spades, and a trick in each of the rounded suits. However, he chose to finesse the jack, allowing West to win and drive out the king. The defense took three club tricks, a heart and a spade for down one.</p>
        <p>In the replay against the same contract, the Swedish West led the club nine, the popular choice from this holding in the tournament world. East won with the ace and continued the suit. South took his king and played on spades, ensuring nine tricks. He could not be prevented from scoring a heart in addition to five diamonds, two spades and a club. Romania gained 12 imps.</p>
