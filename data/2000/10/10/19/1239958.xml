        <p>Medicare premiums will rise nearly 10 percent next year, to $50 a month, and Social Security checks will grow by 3.5 percent, to cover increases in the cost of living, the government said today.</p>
        <p>The cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security will be the largest since 1992.</p>
        <p>For retired workers, the average Social Security benefit will increase next year by $29 a month, to $845 a month, from $816.</p>
        <p>Medicare premiums, which are ordinarily deducted from Social Security checks, will rise $4.50 a month. The increase may jolt beneficiaries, who have become accustomed to stable premiums in recent years. The monthly premium is now $45.50, just as in 1999. It was $43.80 in 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>Medicare provides health care for 39 million people who are 65 or older or disabled. The cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security will raise benefits paid each month to 49.4 million people: 45.2 million in the old age, survivors and disability insurance programs, and 4.2 million with low incomes who receive Supplemental Security Income.</p>
        <p>Social Security payments are increased to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Medicare premiums rise with spending in Part B of Medicare, which covers doctors' services, outpatient hospital care, medical equipment and some home health care.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Moon, an economist at the Urban Institute, said the rise in Medicare premiums came as elderly people faced increases in many health care expenses.</p>
        <p>Those costs, Ms. Moon said, include the patient's share of the bill for services covered by Medicare; premiums for private insurance to supplement Medicare, and prescription drugs, which are generally not covered outside a hospital stay.</p>
        <p>Taken together, Ms. Moon said, the increase in Medicare premiums and other health care costs would eat up much of the increase in Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>But Thomas R. Saving, an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, said, ''Some Social Security recipients will be better off than they were before because the cost-of-living adjustment overcompensates for the actual rise in prices.''</p>
