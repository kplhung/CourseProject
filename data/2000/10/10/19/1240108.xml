        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to Roger Kahn's ''Baseball Town, Again'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 14), an Oct. 17 letter writer says baseball's glory days were from 1947 to 1956, when he was between 10 and 19 years old. The writer might consider that it is the very fact of his youth, not the game itself, that makes the era seems so golden in retrospect.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to Roger Kahn's ''Baseball Town, Again'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 14), an Oct. 17 letter writer says baseball's glory days were from 1947 to 1956, when he was between 10 and 19 years old. The writer might consider that it is the very fact of his youth, not the game itself, that makes the era seems so golden in retrospect.</p>
        <p>By insisting that a 2000 Subway Series ''will never capture the magic'' of the past, the writer will miss the excitement, suspense, heartbreak and joy of the present. Baseball has never been more competitive, more inclusive or more exciting; we are living in the golden age right now. Why not stop mourning the past and enjoy it?</p>
