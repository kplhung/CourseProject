        <p>Three weeks after warning investors that revenue would fall short of estimates, Apple Computer today announced quarterly earnings that narrowly missed even Wall Street's lowered estimates.</p>
        <p>Apple also sounded a new note of caution for the coming year, as it revised its earnings forecast for the current quarter and fiscal year. The computer maker's chief executive, Steven Jobs, announced a hiring freeze and said the company would cut prices on its newest offering, the cube-shaped PowerMac G4, which has failed to catch on the way the company expected.</p>
        <p>Apple reported net profit, excluding investment gains, of $108 million, or 30 cents a share, missing analysts' revised estimates by a penny. In the period a year earlier, Apple earned $90 million, or 25 cents a share. Revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30, were $1.87 billion, up 40 percent from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Analysts had forecast earnings of $165 million, or 45 cents a share, until Sept. 28, when Apple warned that its revenue would be significantly below expectations.</p>
        <p>''Our plan is to be back on track for the January quarter,'' Mr. Jobs said. He attributed the slump to sluggish sales across the board, especially in the education market and in sales of the G4, known as the Cube. The company said it would slow its manufacturing rate in the current quarter to clear out excess inventory now on retailers' shelves.</p>
        <p>Apple lowered its projection of sales for the current quarter, the first of fiscal 2001, to about $1.6 billion, which is expected to drag down results for the full year. The company said it now expected revenue for 2001 of $7.5 billion to $8 billion.</p>
        <p>Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan, said he applauded Apple's honesty in lowering its guidance for the coming year, but said that the company faced a challenge in rebuilding demand for its products.</p>
        <p>''They are going to have to step up some of their spending on advertising to keep the Mac franchise vibrant,'' Mr. Kunstler said.</p>
        <p>The company attributed $90 million of the missed revenue to weaker-than-expected sales of the Cube. Mr. Jobs announced that the company would release a less expensive model by next spring.</p>
        <p>''We don't view this as an endemic problem; we see this as a problem with one product line,'' Mr. Jobs said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jobs also said earnings suffered from a ''megahertz gap,'' in which customers equated lower megahertz speeds with slower computing speeds. Mr. Jobs said Apple's processor speed is competitive with processors with higher megahertz numbers. To soothe worries of potential customers, however, Apple will form an alliance with Motorola to release processors with higher megahertz levels, he said.</p>
        <p>Education sales also fell, partly,  Mr. Jobs said, because of a poorly timed revamping of its sales department.</p>
        <p>Charlie Wolf, an analyst with UBS Warburg, said he believed that Apple's problems were surmountable. ''I think Apple will recover,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Andrew Neff, an analyst with Bear, Sterns, was not as confident.  ''Apple benefits from its own momentum,'' Mr. Neff said. ''The question is: How do they restart their momentum?''</p>
        <p>Apple shares remained unchanged at $20.125, on trading volume of nearly 15 million shares. The earnings were released after the markets closed.</p>
