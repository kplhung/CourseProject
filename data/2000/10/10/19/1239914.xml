        <p>Classical dance in India has a select number of master teachers. Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra, who performed with his small group at Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College on Saturday night, is revered for an even greater contribution: the prominent role he played in the revival of Odissi dance.</p>
        <p>Like much of Indian dance that had fallen into disrepute by the early 20th century, Odissi, from the eastern state of Orissa, became remote from its sacred roots. Removed from the temples, its idiom was preserved in the streets by boys dressed as girls. Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra was one of these dancers, known as gotipuas.</p>
        <p>Or so he was described at the Lyon Dance Biennial last month in France, where he performed with the company of one of his most brilliant female disciples, Madhavi Mudgal. The Lyon program featured three generations, including Ms. Mudgal's young students, to show how tradition is indeed passed down.</p>
        <p>All the more fascinating, then, to see similar ''Pallavi'' or pure-dance excerpts performed by Debi Basu, Daksha Mashruwala and Anandi Ramchandran, who were billed here as the guru's ''senior disciples.'' Maturity gave the curved sculptural stance (one hip jutting out) of Odissi a womanly signature. Wearing turquoise, purple and red saris, the women exemplified a dynamism Odissi does not always show.</p>
        <p>Ratikant Mohapatra, the guru's son and an agile if portly dancer with fluid arms, offered a solo in which he easily integrated his comic acting as the monkey Hanuman into a continuum of dancing.</p>
        <p>For the sensuous aspect specific to Odissi, one had to wait for Guru Mohapatra. Here as in Lyon, his mime solo translated an accompanying song with erotic content into a metaphor for divine union between the god Krishna and Radha, his beloved.</p>
        <p>At 75, Guru Mohapatra leaves the fast footwork to others. But like the greatest of Kabuki actors, he can touch the viewer with a raised eyebrow, a modest giggle and a body molded into into an expressive pose. All is nonetheless in flux as this master moves from role to role. One moment he is Krishna playing his flute and the next he is a coquettish Radha rearranging her hair after the passion of love and looking into her  palm at a mirror that seems more than imaginary -- so vividly is it defined by gesture and nuance.</p>
        <p>Although more drawn out, a scene from the Ramayana, the Hindu epic, was imbued with the same expressiveness by Guru Mohapatra. The fine musicians included Bijay Jena, vocalist, and Ramesh Chandra Das on the violin. The program, part of a national tour, was presented by the World Music Institute.</p>
