        <p>Using DNA evidence, the police have linked six sexual assaults against women and girls as young as 9 in Queens and the Bronx to one man, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The attacks were spread over a three-year period, from March 1997 until as recently as last month. Most of the attacks took place in the afternoon or evening. At least two of the attacks may have taken place after the man followed the victims home from school.</p>

        <p>Using DNA evidence, the police have linked six sexual assaults against women and girls as young as 9 in Queens and the Bronx to one man, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The attacks were spread over a three-year period, from March 1997 until as recently as last month. Most of the attacks took place in the afternoon or evening. At least two of the attacks may have taken place after the man followed the victims home from school.</p>
        <p>In four cases, he gained entry into the victims' apartments by posing as a worker checking on a leak, said Deputy Chief Joseph Reznick, the commander of Queens detectives.  ''We would very much like to get this perpetrator identified and off the streets,'' the chief said.</p>
        <p>The first rape occurred on Ellis Avenue in the Bronx on March 5, 1997, when the man knocked on the door of a 26-year-old woman and claimed to be the superintendent's assistant to get into her apartment, where he raped her, the police said.</p>
        <p>He struck again more than two years later, on May 19, 1999, when he followed a 9-year-old girl into her apartment building, on 73rd Street in Queens, and talked his way into her apartment.</p>
        <p>The other attacks were the rapes of a 12-year-old on Dec. 10, 1999, in her home at 134th Street in Queens;  of a 16-year-old on Feb. 10, at a building on 205th Street in the Bronx;  and of a 17-year-old girl in a building on East Mosholu Parkway in the Bronx on June 3, the police said.</p>
        <p>In the most recent sexual attack, the rapist posed as a plumber to get to get into an apartment on 38th Street in Queens on Sept. 25 and rape an 11-year-old girl, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police have described the suspect as a Hispanic man between the ages of 20 and 30, about 5 feet 8 inches tall and 160 pounds.</p>
