        <p>The removal of Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia has opened new opportunities for peace in the Balkan region, but also created a fluid situation where treacherous problems abound.</p>
        <p>For some time, Western strategic thinking on the area has involved the notion that if Mr. Milosevic could be ousted, other problems would fall away. But for a variety of reasons -- including the depth of anti-Serbian feeling engendered by nine years of war and the record of Mr. Milosevic's successor -- little soothing balm has immediately been felt.</p>
        <p>Vojislav Kostunica, the new Yugoslav president, has been in office for almost two weeks now. He has made clear conciliatory signals toward Croatia, which long battled Belgrade for its independence, and Montenegro, where secessionist currents are strong. Yet his gestures have not convinced a skeptical region.</p>
        <p>''There has been tremendous positive change in Serbia, but it has not had the immediate positive impact on the region that we would have hoped,'' said William D. Montgomery, the Budapest-based United States ambassador with responsibility for Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>A new era in the Balkans has opened. Mr. Milosevic, who propelled Yugoslavia into war nine years ago, is gone; Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president who fanned Mr. Milosevic's flames, is dead; Alija Izetbegovic, the outgunned and stubborn Bosnian president, quit last weekend. It is not surprising that expectations are high.</p>
        <p>But it is not yet clear that Mr. Kostunica is able, or willing, to deliver what America wants. His past nationalism makes some neighbors skeptical, his popularity in the West makes other neighbors envious, and his arrival has come so late in the process of Yugoslav disintegration that it is far from clear that the process can be arrested.</p>
        <p>''The tremors continue from what has been a very strong political shock, and there is some ambivalence in the region,'' said Zarko Korac, an ally of Mr. Kostunica who visited Croatia last week. ''Some people feel that Serbia will now get off the hook too quickly, and there is concern we will get the lion's share of money and attention.''</p>
        <p>The American investment in a Balkan breakthrough assuring stability is enormous. Consolidating Serbia's democratic transition and encouraging Mr. Kostunica to reassure Serbia's neighbors are now Washington's twin priorities, officials said.</p>
        <p>With more than 10,000 United States troops still in Bosnia and Kosovo, and hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into Bosnia to consolidate the five-year-old peace there, this two-track policy is rooted in a clear national interest.</p>
        <p>There are encouraging signs. Leaders from Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and other Balkan states are to meet Mr. Kostunica in Skopje, the Macedonian capital, next week -- the first such gathering for many years and an indication of the hope engendered by the Yugoslav president.</p>
        <p>But the meeting also illustrates a central point: the problems of the Balkans remain deeply interlinked. Change a border here -- in Montenegro or Kosovo, for example -- and Bosnia's Serbs may feel justified in demanding union with Serbia or a state of their own. Support Serbia with a lifting of sanctions and Croatia may feel slighted or enraged.</p>
        <p>The question now is how sensitive Mr. Kostunica will be to this regional volatility. Up to now, the signals have been mixed.</p>
        <p>''We would have liked to hear Mr. Kostunica address the Serbs of Bosnia and tell them that while they will always have a special relationship with Belgrade, their future lies unambiguously in Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' said Jacques Klein, the American who is the chief United Nations representative in Sarajevo. ''But it has not happened.''</p>
        <p>Rather, Mr. Kostunica has said he respects the 1995 Dayton accords while setting the Bosnian government's nerves on edge by indicating that he may travel this weekend to the Serbian part of Bosnia to attend the emotional reburial of a poet, Jovan Ducic, whose remains are being flown in from the United States.</p>
        <p>When James O'Brien, the special adviser to President Clinton on the Balkans, raised the question last week of the hundreds of Kosovo Albanian detainees in Serbian prisons, Mr. Kostunica said he would examine the matter but also pleaded with the American envoy to ''feel the pain that a lot of Serbian families feel over losses in Kosovo.''</p>
        <p>This amounted to an appeal for balance. But the fact is the new president has repeatedly shown sensitivity to Serbian national feelings while appearing, up to now, to have difficulty in showing empathy for those in the region who have suffered at the hands of Serbian forces. This stance helped get him elected; it is far from clear that it will be helpful to delicate regional diplomacy.</p>
        <p>The situation in Bosnia remains volatile in the run-up to elections on Nov. 11. Mass graves of Muslims killed by Serbs continue to be discovered, and there have been minor clashes between Muslim and Serbian students. In these circumstances, any encouragement from Mr. Kostunica to the Bosnian Serbs to look to Belgrade before Sarajevo could be destabilizing.</p>
        <p>In Croatia, President Stipe Mesic has welcomed Mr. Kostunica's victory, but has also warned that Yugoslavia must pay war damages for the 1991-95 conflict and insisted on the ''importance of applying equal standards in assessing the progress made by each country'' in the region.</p>
        <p>Western moves to lift many sanctions on Serbia while people like Mr. Milosevic who have been indicted by the International Tribunal in the The Hague remain at large have enraged many people in Croatia, where the West has made compliance with the tribunal a central issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mesic, a moderate liked in Washington, is already under bitter attack from the nationalist Croatian right for being a stooge of the West and undermining Croatia's ''war of liberation'' by extraditing war-crimes suspects. If Mr. Kostunica shrugs off Serbia's wars and is still embraced by the West, Mr. Mesic's position may be further undermined.</p>
        <p>In Montenegro, the last remaining republic still tied to Serbia in what is left of Yugoslavia, Mr. Kostunica is straining to repair the crippling damage inflicted by Mr. Milosevic. He has the support of Washington because Montenegrin independence is viewed as potentially destabilizing, officials said. As one Western official put it, ''The door to Montenegrin independence is now closed.''</p>
        <p>But that is not how many supporters of the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, view the situation. Having encouraged Mr. Djukanovic to go his own way in order to undermine Mr. Milosevic, the United States may now have great trouble in controlling the movement. The pressure for independence from Kosovo Albanians may also be difficult to contain.</p>
        <p>Having talked a tough line on both Montenegro and Kosovo in the election campaign, Mr. Kostunica is now sounding far more moderate. But suspicions of him in those two places remain deep.</p>
        <p>Mr. Korac, a leader of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, which backs Mr. Kostunica, said these suspicions would be overcome. ''The preoccupation with borders and sovereignty will now subside in the Balkans,'' he said. ''Milosevic kept this alive. He was obsessed, but Mr. Kostunica is not.''</p>
        <p>The daunting task ahead of the new Yugoslav president is to convince his wary neighbors that this is indeed the case, while retaining domestic Serbian support won partly through a patriotic message that offered no apology for the devastating costs of Mr. Milosevic's flirtation with a Greater Serbia.</p>
