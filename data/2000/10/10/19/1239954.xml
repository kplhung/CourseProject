        <p>The euro sank to a new low against the dollar today, two days after the president of the European Central Bank provoked a furor by publicly suggesting that central banks would not intervene soon to strengthen the struggling currency.</p>
        <p>The euro, the unified currency adopted by 11 European nations, dropped more than 2 cents to 83.76 cents. The decline erased the limited gains that the euro made after central banks from Europe, the United States, Japan and Canada jointly intervened in currency markets on Sept. 22.</p>
        <p>Today's decline came amid violent swings in global stock and bond markets. But it also reflected the euro's credibility problem in world markets, especially given the muddled and contradictory signals from European political leaders and central bankers.</p>
        <p>The euro has lost about 4 cents against the dollar since the day of the intervention, and it has lost more than 25 percent of its value since it was introduced in January 1999.</p>
        <p>Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, jolted investors when he told The Times of London that central bankers would probably not intervene if the euro were pushed down by worries about war in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>In that interview, published on Monday, Mr. Duisenberg also said that he had failed to persuade the United States Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, to soften his public stance that a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States.</p>
        <p>Even though the comments were not terribly revealing, they suggested that another global rescue effort for the euro was unlikely before the presidential election on Nov. 7.</p>
