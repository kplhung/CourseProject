        <p>This autumn's recall of Firestone light truck tires led to the Ford Motor Company's first quarterly drop in operating income in four years and has prompted Bridgestone/Firestone to undertake a broad reorganization, with Japanese executives taking control of key operations, the companies announced today.</p>
        <p>Ford's third-quarter profit from continuing operations dropped 16 percent, to $994 million, compared with $1.19 billion in the 1999 period.</p>
        <p>Ford estimated that the cost of closing assembly plants to divert tires to the replacement effort, combined with various administrative and legal costs, amounted to $500 million before taxes in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Primarily because of a complex recapitalization of the company that considerably increased the number of shares outstanding, Ford's per-share earnings including discontinued operations fell to 53 cents from 90 cents.</p>
        <p>The company's results met analysts' estimates, according to First Call/Thomson Financial..</p>
        <p>Henry D. G. Wallace, Ford's chief financial officer, said that it would be fair to use a tax rate of 32 percent in calculating how the cost of the Firestone recall had affected after-tax profits. That would suggest that the after-tax effect was $340 million -- meaning that Ford would have set a record for third-quarter profit if the recall had not taken place.</p>
        <p>''It was a difficult quarter because of the Firestone incident,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Including discontinued operations and one-time items, net income fell to $888 million from $1.11 billion. Ford shares rose 63 cents, to $25.06.</p>
        <p>Federal regulators are investigating 15-inch Firestone ATX and Wilderness AT tires, which are mounted mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, after receiving complaints attributing more than 100 deaths to the tires.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone, a unit of Bridgestone of Japan, separately announced that it was consolidating 21 operating units into 4, all of which will report to the subsidiary's recently appointed chairman and chief executive, John Lampe.</p>
        <p>Japanese executives will mainly run one of the four new units, encompassing tire design and manufacturing. Sanjay Govindjee, an outside expert appointed by Firestone to investigate the tire failures, said earlier this week that he was examining three possible sources: Firestone's design, Firestone's manufacturing and Ford's design of the Explorer.</p>
        <p>Isao Togashi, 58, who was named the vice chairman of Firestone last week, was chosen president of the company's new manufacturing and technology unit. Shigehisa Sano, 54,  director of tire development for Bridgestone in Japan, was named an executive vice president of Firestone and president of the manufacturing and technology unit's product development division. Itsuo Miyake, 53, Bridgestone's general manager of tire material development, will become president of the Firestone unit's research division.</p>
