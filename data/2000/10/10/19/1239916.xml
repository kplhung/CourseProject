        <p>One of the newest, poorest and least developed nations in the world, East Timor is the ultimate welfare state -- a ward of the international community subsisting almost entirely on handouts from abroad.</p>
        <p>Though statistics are fuzzy in this tiny, threadbare country, it might be called the land of 70 percent. About that much of its population is illiterate, about that much of its potential urban work force is unemployed and about that many of its buildings were destroyed by pro-Indonesian militias in a rampage of revenge when it voted for independence a little over a year ago.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the United Nations runs the country -- both its administration and its economy -- with input from an international roll call of aid agencies. But in a year or so, it will become a full-fledged nation and will have to  find a way to make it on its own.</p>
        <p>Wouldn't it be wonderful if, let us say, East Timor struck oil.</p>
        <p>In fact, oil is the potential savior of the nation's economy. Billions of barrels of oil lie under the Timor Sea just off the coast in what is known as the Timor Gap. A major field called Bayu Undan is expected to go into production in about four years.</p>
        <p>The question is how much of the revenue this little nation will get. The Timor Gap lies midway between East Timor and Australia and, under treaties signed long ago with Indonesia -- as the occupying power -- Australia claims about half the revenue from the deposits. With the United Nations standing in for it -- in the unusual position of negotiating a treaty on behalf of one nation against another -- East Timor has opened talks here with Australia to lay claim to what it sees as its rightful undersea riches.</p>
        <p>The potential windfall is enormous. Depending on the price of oil, East Timor stands to earn taxes and royalties that could amount to many times its current yearly budget of about $45 million.</p>
        <p>''What is at stake here is huge for East Timor,'' said the chief United Nations negotiator, Peter Galbraith, the minister for political affairs in the United Nations transitional administration. ''By the second half of this decade, the Timor Gap could be producing as much as $150 million a year for East Timor.''</p>
        <p>If oil prices remain at their new high, he said, that figure could almost double. And two large gas fields could produce an additional $1 billion over 20 to 30 years.</p>
        <p>The money, if spent wisely, could transform East Timor from a subsistence economy dependent on foreign handouts to one with real options for development and growth. It could help educate the population, combat endemic diseases and speed the building of infrastructure in a territory that was left largely fallow through 24 years of Indonesian occupation.</p>
        <p>''These are resources that have the potential to make East Timor self-sustaining,'' Mr. Galbraith said, ''to make the difference between its being a small country dependent on foreign aid as far into the future as we can see, as opposed to its being self-sufficient in five years.''</p>
        <p>East Timor has staked a claim to virtually all the resources of the Timor Gap, while Australia is seeking to maintain the 50-50 split.</p>
        <p>But Australia is in the embarrassing position of having negotiated that mutually beneficial arrangement with Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975, and ignoring the sovereign interests of the Timorese. Mr. Galbraith can now argue that that treaty is invalid on its face; the United Nations never recognized Indonesia's annexation of East Timor.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 30, 1999, East Timor's 800,000 people voted for independence from Indonesia despite the intimidation of the militias. International peacekeepers took control three weeks later, and the United Nations installed its caretaker administration shortly afterward.</p>
        <p>The United Nations is now in the process of helping construct a new nation from the ground up. But East Timor, a largely agricultural land, has few resources on which to build an economy apart from something like $20 million a year in coffee exports and hopes for a small tourism industry.</p>
        <p>The Timor Gap negotiations are complex and multilayered, Mr. Galbraith said, ''a quirky mixture of politics, geology and international law.''</p>
        <p>Politically, Australia is already committed to helping put East Timor back on its feet, providing large amounts of aid and forming the backbone of international peacekeeping. But if it compromises on the questions of maritime boundaries, it could provide the grounds for territorial challenges from another neighbor, Indonesia.</p>
        <p>Geologically, Mr. Galbraith said he would argue that, according to new research, the Timor Gap is not in fact a fault line between tectonic plates, weakening a legal claim made by Australia on the basis of features of the seabed.</p>
        <p>The important questions of international law have to do with the setting of maritime boundaries based on an international standard of 200 miles. Since the two nations are less than 400 miles apart, the talks will involve arguments over the principle of setting the boundary at the midpoint between them.</p>
        <p>A line midway between East Timor and Australia, Mr. Galbraith said, would give the smaller country full sovereignty over the richest and most keenly disputed oil field.</p>
        <p>When the United Nations steps aside and East Timor officially becomes a sovereign state late next year, the legacy of the international caretaker government will be a broad one, including all the basic elements of nationhood. If the Timor Gap negotiations succeed, it could also include a fat cash windfall of up to 100 percent of revenue.</p>
