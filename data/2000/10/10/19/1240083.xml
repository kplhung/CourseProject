        <p>DaimlerChrysler A.G., has again expanded its relationship with Jacoby &amp; Springer in Hamburg, Germany, by naming the agency to handle creative duties for two Mercedes-Benz car models, the C-Class Sportcoupe and the C-Class T-Model, which are to be introduced next year in several crucial markets worldwide.

        <p>J. Justus Schneider, vice president for marketing communications worldwide at Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, Germany, said the decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Jacoby &amp; Springer and four other agencies Mercedes works with: Batey Ads in Singapore, part of the Batey Group, an associate investment of the WPP Group; Devarrieux Villaret in Paris, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas Advertising; Partners BDDH in London, also part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas; and Clemenger BBDO in Melbourne, Australia, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>

        <p>DaimlerChrysler A.G., has again expanded its relationship with Jacoby &amp; Springer in Hamburg, Germany, by naming the agency to handle creative duties for two Mercedes-Benz car models, the C-Class Sportcoupe and the C-Class T-Model, which are to be introduced next year in several crucial markets worldwide. Billings were estimated at more than $30 million.</p>
        <p>J. Justus Schneider, vice president for marketing communications worldwide at Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, Germany, said the decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Jacoby &amp; Springer and four other agencies Mercedes works with: Batey Ads in Singapore, part of the Batey Group, an associate investment of the WPP Group; Devarrieux Villaret in Paris, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas Advertising; Partners BDDH in London, also part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas; and Clemenger BBDO in Melbourne, Australia, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>Springer &amp; Jacoby, which was recently named to handle the Smart car in markets outside Germany, also handles the German accounts for the Smart car and Mercedes-Benz. In the United States, creative duties for Mercedes-Benz are handled by Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of Omnicom.</p>
        <p>The decision is significant because Springer &amp; Jacoby is selling an initial 35.5 percent stake to True North Communications. The DaimlerChrysler Group in Auburn Hills, Mich., is considering units of either True North or Omnicom for the possible consolidation of the creative and media account for all Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and corporate ads, with an annual budget of $1.8 billion.</p>
