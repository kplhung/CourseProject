        <p>ASHLEA EBELING and Craig Bloom bought a low-slung 60's house here last year for the same reason any newlyweds would buy a house in the suburbs: they wanted space, light, a lawn and room to raise a family.</p>
        <p>But there was another reason: they wanted to save it.</p>
        <p>''We figured it made sense to buy now as opposed to wait, because we knew that in two or three years, with all the tear-downs, there might not be any Modernist houses left,'' Mr. Bloom said, sitting at his blond-wood dining table under a period canister lamp his wife had found in the pantry closet. ''Knowing that these were a diminishing breed made it especially attractive to us.''</p>
        <p>Their fears turned out to be justified. After they bought their unlikely dream house, a developer stopped to tell them he had considered buying it -- but would have torn it down and built one of the far grander shingle-style villas or Georgian-style palazzi springing up all over town, starter mansions selling for millions. Ms. Ebeling and Mr. Bloom bought the house in May 1999 for $700,000, after landing in a bidding war with yet another developer.</p>
        <p>They were just in time. ''The way the price of land here has gone up,'' Mr. Bloom said last week, ''I don't think we would've won now. We couldn't have paid the price. The developer would have gotten it.''</p>
        <p>The couple, both 34 -- he is a lawyer, she a writer -- are members of a cadre of design connoisseurs who love a building most of the population loves to hate: the small Modernist house, with its right angles filled in with glass. Their numbers may be growing: Architecture magazine titled its July issue ''Learning to Love the Box.''</p>
        <p>Nowhere is the urgency to save Modernist houses felt more strongly than in New Canaan, home to a renowned assortment of them. This weekend, two busloads of architecture buffs will visit some of the houses here and drive past more of the rest. Local groups have held panel discussions in which participants have called New Canaan the ''Mecca of Modernism'' and deplored the not-so-gradual extinction of the town's midcentury treasures. Echoes, a magazine devoted to the 1950's, is publishing a piece on New Canaan's houses in February. A Japanese architecture magazine devoted 12 pages to just one of the houses here. But the houses are being demolished just as they are being internationally hailed as retro chic.</p>
        <p>This is the town where a young Philip Johnson built his famous Glass House. The town was also home to the four other architects who, with Johnson, were known as the Harvard Five: Marcel Breuer, Eliot Noyes, John M. Johansen and Landis Gores.</p>
        <p>Those architects, with a group that gravitated to New Canaan to work with them (including Hugh Smallen, who designed Ms. Ebeling's and Mr. Bloom's house), built nearly 100 Modernist homes here.</p>
        <p>At first, the homes looked ''modern,'' and starkly different from everything around them. They seemed to herald a new kind of suburban ease -- a clearheaded minimalism that belied all the work required to keep those open spaces clean. A thousand people showed up for the first house tour in 1949. The houses crowded the design magazines, and elated homeowners opened their doors to curious strangers.</p>
        <p>But by the late 1960's, the house tours had stopped because the houses were no longer considered cutting-edge. As with many other Modernist structures, there were nagging construction problems: precisely designed metal edges that didn't quite meet the glass, leaky roofs, cracked wallboard.</p>
        <p>As of this week, 19 of the 96 original houses had been torn down. One survivor, designed by John M. Johansen, was demolished in August. Now, only a backhoe stands on the five-and-a-half-acre lot.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Johansen, the destruction has  been devastating: he has lost three of the seven houses he built in New Canaan. ''I may sound bitter,'' he said on Tuesday, ''but losing each building is like a death in the family. It's gut stuff.''</p>
        <p>A few streets away, a little gray Marcel Breuer house still stands. A year ago, another Breuer stood next door. It was replaced by a huge Hamptonesque shingled ''cottage'' looking down on its tiny neighbor.</p>
        <p>Besides their relatively small size and whatever lingering construction problems afflict them, these contemporary houses clearly do not appeal to most buyers here.</p>
        <p>''The market doesn't want them,'' said Richard R. Girouard, a New Canaan developer who has built 20 houses in the last five years, most of them 7,000 to 11,000 square feet. Most, he said, now sell for more than $4 million. ''It's colonials everyone wants. The older they look, the more they like them.''</p>
        <p>Steve Chainani calls himself a ''developer/technology entrepreneur.'' He used to own the house next door to Ms. Ebeling and Mr. Bloom and is frank: yes, he considered buying their house, and he would have torn it down. ''I've done that several times,'' he said cheerfully. ''Twice in New Canaan and once in Westport.''</p>
        <p>The houses are like catnip to developers. ''Those little modern houses are selling below their intrinsic value,'' Mr. Chainani said. ''The market favors high ceilings, piped-in music, libraries with hand-carved cherry paneling. They want super-luxury to the point of ostentation.'' The little houses are ''way below standard,'' he added. ''They just don't cut it.''</p>
        <p>Carol Hollyday, the William Pitt real estate broker who sold Ms. Ebeling and Mr. Bloom their house, agreed. ''The key is to find a couple like Ashlea and Craig who appreciate the older contemporary house,'' she said. ''They're a very small group. They happened to come along, and there was a house. That's very rare indeed.''</p>
        <p>The Modernist houses are unpopular not only because they fail to satisfy today's appetite for expansive square footage. Their layouts are also out of favor. ''The bedrooms are very small, and they don't have the right bedroom-bathroom configuration,'' Mr. Girouard said.</p>
        <p>The town of New Canaan itself has reduced their appeal: once you've bought one of these houses, it's particularly difficult to add on to it. The local zoning regulations restrict the size of a house's ''footprint,'' making it easier to build a second story than to add a one-story wing.</p>
        <p>To Arlene Stern, who owns the house Marcel Breuer moved into with his family in 1951, the regulation is clearly unfair. When she bought the house three years ago, Ms. Stern, a women's clothing executive, applied to the town's zoning commission for a waiver to build a 1,500-square-foot master bedroom and bath addition (with walk-in closet) on her three acres. The response was discouraging. Two revisions later, she was turned down. She was mad enough to consider selling the house to developers.</p>
        <p>''I still have days when I feel that way,'' said Ms. Stern, who said she keeps her clothes in the five small closets scattered throughout her house. ''Somebody on the zoning board asked me why don't I just put on a second floor. Breuer is one of the country's best architects, but they could care less.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Ms. Stern couldn't part with the Breuer house. And now, she said, some of her friends are urging her to reapply. The first selectman, Richard Bond, said it might be more effective to have an expert on Modernist houses propose changes to the town's regulations first.</p>
        <p>Landmarking of the Modernist houses seems unlikely. ''Those houses are not historic,'' Mr. Bond said. Richard Bergmann, a local architect and an outspoken champion of the houses, noted that federal guidelines for landmark districts mandate that the key buildings there must be at least 50 years old. Mr. Bergmann is an authority: he is chairman of the town's historic district commission. (Philip Johnson has deeded his Glass House to the National Trust for Historic Preservation for use as a museum.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergmann, who once worked under Eliot Noyes, and Mr. Bond are proposing deed restrictions for the houses, which they say would protect them. The deed restrictions would be placed on the property by the owner, and would prohibit subsequent owners from demolishing the house. But deed restrictions lower the property's value.</p>
        <p>''We're going to start telling people that the town will pay for the legal expenses of putting on deed restrictions,'' Mr. Bond said in an interview. ''That's probably the best way to save these houses.''</p>
        <p>''It is a harsh choice for these owners,'' said Mr. Bloom, the 34-year-old lawyer, who is still renovating his five-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot Modernist house. ''I haven't discussed it with Ashlea, but we might both feel it is worth it to take less money if we had to sell than to see it destroyed.''</p>
        <p>But for him, talk of deed restrictions is premature. ''We can't envision ever leaving,'' he said. ''We have every intention of living here for a really long time.''</p>
