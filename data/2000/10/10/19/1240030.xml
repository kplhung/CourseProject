        <p>The Yankees' clubhouse was chaotic and thick with the smell of Champagne mixed with sweat Wednesday morning.</p>
        <p>For the fourth time in five seasons, the Yankees celebrated reaching the World Series. Willie Randolph, the Yankees' Brooklyn-born third base coach, talked about how unreal this Subway Series was.</p>
        <p>Don Zimmer, the Yankees' bench coach, who played in the last Subway Series as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was telling another group how unreal this was. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, an unabashed Yankee fan, was in the middle of the clubhouse telling reporters how unreal this was. Dwight Gooden stood off to the side in front of his locker. For Gooden, this Subway Series was not unreal but surreal. He would be playing in another World Series against his first team, his first love, really: the New York Mets.</p>
        <p>Gooden has spent a lifetime in New York. He has been to the heights, and experienced the depths. Now his past is connecting with his future in one World Series.</p>
        <p>''Coming up with the Mets in the early 80's at that time, growing up in the Mets organization, you grow to kind of dislike the Yankees,'' Gooden said. ''It's nothing personal. Just the way it is. Now that I'm on the other side, it's just the opposite.''</p>
        <p>Gooden was drafted by the Mets in 1982 and came up in 1984. He became Dr. K and then Doc while creating his fame at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>In 1984, he was the National League strikeout leader and its Rookie of the Year. In 1985, he won the National League Cy Young award and led the league in earned run average and strikeouts.</p>
        <p>After the Yankees clinched, Gooden said 1986 did not seem so far away.</p>
        <p>''Now it seems like yesterday,'' he said. ''If you'd ask me this yesterday or the day before, it seems like a while ago. Now with this Subway Series, it brings back a lot of good memories.</p>
        <p>''I have a lot of respect for the Mets organization,'' he added. ''They always treated me and my family real well, especially the front office. Now it's head up, and I'm on this side.''</p>
        <p>Yankee players do not come up disliking the Mets or needing to play the Mets to affirm and authenticate themselves. In fact, in the Yankee universe, where history and legacy sustain fans during lean years, the Mets don't really exist in any serious or fundamental way. The franchise in Queens is just sort of there.</p>
        <p>''I didn't grow up in this organization,'' Gooden said of the Yankees. ''But you kind of get the sense, though. It's like they're secondary.''</p>
        <p>He said that fans -- Mets fans mostly -- still see him as a Met.</p>
        <p>''A lot of times you go out to eat or to the movies,'' he said, ''and people say 'Doc, we love you but we still remember you as a Met -- you're still a Met at heart.' It's good to have just the support here in the city. I'm just happy to be back and be in New York.''</p>
        <p>Is he, in fact, a Met at heart? Gooden smiled. He didn't get to be a 16-year veteran by answering questions like that.</p>
        <p>''I'm a New Yorker at heart,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If there is a player on either team who binds Yankees and Mets, who takes the edge off what could be a bitter series, Gooden is that player. He came to New York as a 19-year-old and became a star in a city of stars and celebrities. He was Derek Jeter before there was Jeter.</p>
        <p>Then the city nearly consumed him; there were bouts with alcohol and drugs. The Yankees played a significant part in Gooden's rehabilitation. They rescued him in 1996, when he had not pitched for nearly two years. That May, he pitched the only no-hitter of his career.</p>
        <p>''I just look at this as a whole situation for myself,'' said Gooden, in his second stint with the Yankees. ''The fans in New York, the support I've gotten. I've been at my best and also I've been at my lowest, and the fan support has never changed.</p>
        <p>''As a player I've done everything that I can possibly do; this year, getting to pitch at Shea Stadium as a Yankee coming back after being released by Tampa, it was like the ultimate. This is unbelievable; I still have to pinch myself. You can never imagine this.</p>
        <p>''I'm still sitting here thinking, 'No way.' Even when the Mets won last night, I was thinking, 'This is too good to be true. Things like this just don't happen.' Now that it's actually here, I'm looking forward to it. I think these next three days are going to be the longest three days ever.''</p>
