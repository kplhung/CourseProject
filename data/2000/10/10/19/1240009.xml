        <p>Giving it just a moment's thought, Allen Sherman minced no words yesterday in relating what to him was irrefutable common knowledge.</p>
        <p>''Yankee fans are much more highly educated,'' he said, standing with his wife and friends on a street corner in Midtown. ''We have to be. It's harder to spell Yankees than Mets. And we can curse in so many different languages. We earn more, so when we throw a beer can it's those high-priced beer cans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman, 69, retired from the furnace business, grew up in the Bronx and was up from Florida for the 50th reunion of his Bronx stickball team. ''I don't talk to Mets fans,'' he said. ''I mean, they look like us. Some of them even talk like us. But they're not us.''</p>
        <p>Fred Sayed, 26, a technical support manager from Queens and a Met fan, was able to be pretty explicit himself in defining Yankee fans: ''All Yankee fans are just flat-out stupid.''</p>
        <p>Now that the baseball gods have finally delivered the Subway Series that New Yorkers have prayed for, those two distinctive and combative camps, the fans who worship in the Bronx and those who pay homage in Queens, are at the raucous forefront of city life. But what taxonomic groups do these two species belong to? Can you even find a classification for them, especially a printable one?</p>
        <p>Anthropological studies of these creatures being in appallingly short supply, one makes do with what's available. A New York Times/CBS News poll of adults in New York State that asked people whom they root for and then looked at who they are is one piece of insight.</p>
        <p>The poll was conducted late last October, when the Yankees were already playing in the big show and the Mets were sulking. It's entirely possible that certain Mets fans, wanting to be part of something good, chose at that moment to align belatedly with the Yankees, and that others were simply too abashed to confess that they were Met fans.</p>
        <p>But who would want those sorts of fans anyway?</p>
        <p>It was small surprise that significantly more New Yorkers said that they were Yankee fans than Met fans. But a stunning one-fifth of those polled said that they didn't care one bit about either team and somehow found other things to do with their lives. That's more than the number of people who confirmed that they were Met fans. More than a third admitted, risking eternal expiation, that they cheered equally hard for both the Mets and the Yankees.</p>
        <p>There's an old presumption, subscribed to by fans of both, that the Mets attract blue-collar workers while the Yankees are the team of the white-collar world.</p>
        <p>Diana Violaris, 25, a secretary from Nutley, N.J.: ''When I think of Mets fans, I see them like the team. Just a bunch of regular blue-collar guys who have seen struggle and work extra hard to be respected.''</p>
        <p>William Smith, a Yankee fan from Maplewood, N.J.: ''Yankee fans are less emotional about the game, less rowdy and more cultured. I believe it's the dignity of the unchanged uniform that correlates into the fans. Upper-class people who enjoy winning and the finer things from life.'' (O.K., then why the big security detail out at the Stadium?)</p>
        <p>It turns out the poll found no significant difference in education or affluence of either group. If you want to be picky, a higher percentage of Met fans had postgraduate degrees.</p>
        <p>Yankee fans are often thought to be older types with families, while  Met fans are reputed to be swinging bachelors. The Times poll actually found that Met fans were slightly older, and there was little difference in the marital status of the groups.</p>
        <p>A majority of Yankee fans, the Times poll said, are women, while a majority of Met fans are men, a finding that several fans interviewed yesterday suggested had something to do with the Yankees' having cuter players. One fan said the Yankees were better dressed. Many others were quick to discount all of that.</p>
        <p>So far as political leanings, the poll suggested that a higher proportion of Met fans were Republicans than was the case with Yankee fans. Yankee fans had a greater number of independents. Met fans were more likely to be moderate politically, and Yankee fans had a greater number of liberals.</p>
        <p>On the street, people had other things to say. Roddel West, 22, unemployed for the moment, and his friend Will Cowan, 31, a hospital maintenance worker, both from Brooklyn, felt confident about what defined a Yankee fan.</p>
        <p>''The Yankee fan is more traditional and more hard-working,'' Mr. Cowan said. ''The Mets fan is more brash and cocky, but what have you done in 14 years? Mets fans talk a lot, but they don't say anything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. West said: ''I think Mets fans don't know as much about baseball. They know 1986 and that's it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowan said: ''They don't even know how to celebrate. When they won, they didn't know, do I hug or do I slap? They don't even know how to give a professional interview.''</p>
        <p>He went on: ''My best friend at work is a Mets fan. He doesn't have the background. He just jumped on the bandwagon. He's just going with the flow. Whatever he sees on SportsCenter that night is what he talks about. I don't know what it is with Mets fans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. West said: ''It has something to do with Queens. I have a friend. He was a Yankee fan. He recently moved to Queens and now he's a Mets fan. We don't talk much anymore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowan said: ''More Mets fans are bachelors. Yankee fans are family people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. West said: ''That's because it's bad to come home from a game when you lose and yell at your wife and kids. You don't have to do that as a Yankee fan. The Yankees don't lose.''</p>
        <p>What are you guys?</p>
        <p>''We're both single,'' Mr. Cowan said.</p>
        <p>The Mets' circle of fans has always been identified as heavily suburban. But a study of people who actually went to the games, done in 1998 by the city's Independent Budget Office, came up with some curious findings. More Met fans came from New York City than did Yankee fans. Almost a quarter of Yankee fans arrived from New Jersey, about double as many as those who went to  Mets games. About a fourth of Met fans at the games were from Long Island, while the Yankees got fewer  than 10 percent from the Island.</p>
        <p>A mere 6 percent of Yankee fans came from the Bronx. Even the Mets pulled 3 percent from the Yankees' home borough.</p>
        <p>Doug Drotman, a vice president at the National Media Group, a Manhattan sports marketing business, said that his own studies suggested that geography was a major predictor of team allegiance. If you grew up in Long Island or Queens, you rooted for the Mets. If you grew up in Staten Island or Brooklyn long enough ago, chances are you cheered for the Dodgers and moved on to the Mets. New Jersey and Manhattan, he said, are tossups, though they lean toward the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''If your parents were a rabid fan of either, you were going to go to the games of whichever team they rooted for,'' Mr. Drotman said. ''But if your parents were not a big fan of either, you were going to take to whichever stadium it was easier to get to.''</p>
        <p>Stuart Gordon, 42, an avowed Met  fan who stocks groceries at a supermarket, saw a difference in attitude. ''Mets fans are more humble,'' he said. ''The Yankee fans are more arrogant. When the Mets win, they're saying, oh it's lucky. When the Yankees win, it's never luck. C'mon.''</p>
        <p>Could it be genetic? Who knows? Mr. Gordon's brother, Allan, 48, grew up in the same house in Queens, same parents, and yet he's a Yankee fan. What gives?</p>
        <p>''I always seemed to take the underdog,'' Stuart said. ''He always took the good team.''</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>''I was more quiet,'' he said. ''He was more outgoing. I guess I didn't want a lot of people to notice. Not many people noticed a Mets fan.''</p>
        <p>Then there are all those New Yorkers who claim that they are capable of rooting jointly for both teams.</p>
        <p>Neil Rothfeld, 47, is a lawyer from Manhattan. He grew up in Brooklyn and became a fan just after the Dodgers rudely left town. He became a Yankee fan. When the Mets came into existence, they were lovable losers. He decided, big deal, he would cheer for them too.</p>
        <p>He said he honestly doesn't care which team wins. ''I just want a great Series,'' he said. ''I want it to go seven games.''</p>
        <p>There may be unrest in his household. His daughter, 9, is a Yankee fan and only a Yankee fan. He attributes that to the fact that the first game he took her to was a Yankee game. His son, 7, is a Met fan. ''Whatever his sister does, he does the opposite,'' Mr. Rothfeld explained.</p>
        <p>As he pondered the divided loyalties of so many New Yorkers, he simply said: ''I try to embrace both sides. I want to have peace.''</p>
