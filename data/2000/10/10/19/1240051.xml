        <p>As children, they would roam their Bensonhurst neighborhood in Brooklyn looking for Borden's milk cartons. Twenty cartons meant a free ticket in the upper deck at Shea Stadium, so John Franco and his brother, Jim, would go through garbage cans and pester their relatives.</p>
        <p>The Mets were the only team the Francos cared about and Yankee Stadium was a far-off place.</p>
        <p>Tuesday night, the brothers sat in John's house in Staten Island, working off a cold and hangover from celebrating the Mets' entry into the World Series on Monday night. On television, they watched the Yankees join them with a 9-7 victory over Seattle. Finally all those verbal wars Franco fought with his neighborhood friends would be played out. Instead of the Mayor's Trophy game -- ''whoever lost, you had to keep your mouth shut,'' Franco said -- the setting will be the World Series, which begins Saturday night at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>If the Mets had any hesitance over calling for a Subway Series after their clinching victory over the Cardinals on Monday, it was gone by yesterday. Mets players and Manager Bobby Valentine welcomed a chance to add their names to a part of baseball history, but they also took note of their bigger goal -- becoming the world champions.</p>
        <p>''It's not a Subway Series,'' Valentine said. ''This is a World Series we're going to. That's how we started up the season and I think it's going to be a great experience.''</p>
        <p>The fact that the Mets will be playing the Yankees is ''part of it,'' Valentine acknowledged, ''but it sure isn't the biggest part. The biggest part is the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Rain at Shea moved the Mets' workout to the indoor batting cages and mounds and forced players to endure nearly two hours of questions about the Yankees. Franco, 40, has the deepest New York city roots of any Met and he tried diplomatically to answer how he felt about the Yankees while growing up in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Did he root against them? ''I grew up a Mets fan,'' he said. Before the question could be rephrased, Franco snapped back with the same response.</p>
        <p>Franco remembers the lean years of the late 1970's when all Mets fans could brag about was that ''we had a better ground crew.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had no place for Franco's family in the Marlboro Houses, the housing project where Franco was reared. His father, Jim, was a heartbroken Brooklyn Dodgers fan who switched his allegiances to the Mets. When his father would return home from his job with the Sanitation Department, he and his two sons would cross Stillwell Avenue to Lafayette High School, where Franco learned to throw an overhand curveball.</p>
        <p>''I felt bad for my brother because he was a catcher and he used to have lots of bumps and bruises,'' Franco said.</p>
        <p>Franco went on to Lafayette and St. John's, where the Dodgers looked past his diminutive stature and drafted him, to the delight of his father.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately he died before I got to Mets,'' said Franco, who wears a bright-orange Sanitation Department T-shirt below his uniform when he pitches. ''That's part of the story.''</p>
        <p>The teams add a new chapter this weekend that probably has very little to do with the last Subway Series in 1956, when the Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in seven games. Valentine went further back, linking the first modern World Series, in 1903 between the Red Sox and the Pirates, and the start of the New York subway system a year later.</p>
        <p>Valentine's players preferred a more contemporary view, carefully answering question about the residue from the Roger Clemens fastball that struck Mike Piazza's helmet in July. The Mets as a group embraced the co-owner Fred Wilpon's characterization of being the underdog.</p>
        <p>''We have to come in here and get over the confidence factor because we know we're not expected to win,'' Darryl Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>Al Leiter held a stronger opinion regarding the perception that the Yankees fear losing to the Mets.</p>
        <p>''I keep hearing about how we have nothing to lose and they have everything to lose,'' Leiter said. ''I want to look at the service time of some of the guys in here -- Johnny, Darryl Hamilton, Lenny Harris, Piazza, Ventura, Zeile, guys that have played 10, 12, 16 years in the majors and they've never been here. You play this game 17 years to get here, don't you think he wants to win, realizing that this might be his last and only shot?</p>
        <p>''If you care and want to win badly, you have everything to lose.''</p>
        <p>Leiter noted Franco had joked with him that after waiting 17 season to make the World Series, he saw the rookie Timo Perez make it after one month in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>Leiter shares Franco's childhood love for the Mets. Leiter grew up a Tom Seaver and Mets fan on the Jersey Shore, but was drafted and developed by the Yankees. He has won World Series rings with the Blue Jays and the Florida Marlins but expects this one to be the most memorable. Leiter has relished his interleague matchups with the Yankees over the last three seasons, games in which he has pitched very well.</p>
        <p>''When I put this into the perspective of life and where I am,'' he said, ''this is all a dream.''</p>
