      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Tom Penn has made Kuroshiwo sterling-silver flatware for babies, above, and for adults, left. Because the tail of the flatware reminds him of the crest of a wave, he named the pattern after a current that runs along the Japanese coast. Among the children's pieces are two Victorian items, a food pusher (left, $205) and a closed spoon (third from left, $225); also available are teaspoons ($165 each) and a cup ($245). For the family that likes to dine with matching flatware, a full-size five-piece place setting is $1,550. Information: Old Newbury Crafters, (800) 343-1388. Incidentally, although his father is Irving Penn, the younger Mr. Penn decided not to become a photographer. ''I'd be doomed,'' he said.</p>
