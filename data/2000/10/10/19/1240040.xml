        <p>New York City and the State Department of Education have been snarling at each other for months over a new state regulation requiring the city to hire only certified teachers in low-performing schools beginning this fall. But a difference of opinion about how to proceed has erupted into administrative warfare. The city's schools chancellor asserts that the new rules have caused hundreds of certified teachers to turn down jobs in the city, a tragic loss to a system that desperately needs qualified teachers.</p>
        <p>The chaos is clearly crippling the reform effort. It is also making New York less desirable to teachers who can use the nationwide teacher shortage to pick and choose where they wish to work. To have any chance at all of attracting fresh talent, the state education commissioner, Richard Mills, and the schools chancellor, Harold Levy, need to lower the volume and come together around common-sense solutions to this problem.</p>
        <p>Like most big cities, New York has historically cheated the poorest public school students by giving them unqualified teachers, weak leadership and a watered-down curriculum. The state Board of Regents has tried to put an end to this practice by raising standards across the state and ordering the schools to hire only certified teachers in low-performing schools as of this year. This requirement will be extended to all schools by the year 2003. Chancellor Levy has tried to meet the new challenge through an alternative certification program that is scheduled to get dramatically larger in the coming years. He has also increased starting salaries of certified teachers who come from outside the system and move into low-performing schools. Even so, by pushing teachers toward low-performing schools the system may be siphoning off qualified teachers from borderline schools, placing them at risk as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy is rightfully enraged by a State Education Department order that forbids the city to fill any public school vacancy as long as there are vacancies in the low-performing schools. Mr. Mills, the state education commissioner, is right to push the city on this matter. But it is senselessly punitive to hold up hiring all across the city when a few of the low-performing schools end up with vacancies. Such vacancies are inevitable in a system in which more than 300 teachers fail to show up in an ordinary year. If Mr. Mills has a remedy for the recruitment problem, he should put it forward.</p>
        <p>But the education commissioner is accurate when he describes the city's recruitment effort as slow off the mark. The city should have long since created a large, year-round alternative certification program and begun a recruiting push that reached every corner of the English-speaking world. Given the current teacher shortage, City Hall should have immediately expanded the system of financial bonuses and teacher support programs that have proved effective in low-performing schools. Most crucially, starting salaries for new teachers need to be raised.</p>
        <p>Recruiting qualified teachers in the midst of a nationwide shortage would be difficult in any case. But Mr. Mills and Mr. Levy have worsened the problem by turning this dispute into a personal one. For starters, the two men should put aside their egos and get to work on a compromise that will attract qualified teachers for the children of New York -- but in a way that does not paralyze the hiring effort in the city as whole.</p>
