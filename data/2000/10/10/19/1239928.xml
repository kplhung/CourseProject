        <p>Why do we keep dreaming about utopia?</p>
        <p>That's not exactly the question posed by ''Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World,'' a pensive extravaganza, if one can imagine such a thing, at the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Hundreds of books, manuscripts, maps, prints, photographs, bits of music, film, Nazi paraphernalia, Soviet propaganda, 1960's antiwar buttons, rock album covers and other curiosities spill across galleries on two floors.</p>
        <p>The show, a collaboration between the library and the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, begins with a gigantic subject and enlarges on it. It is an ambitious strategy: serious, stylish, amusing, charming even, but occasionally aggravating. French, in other words.</p>
        <p>Like most library exhibitions, it is more of a reading event than a show about visual pleasure, and as a near free-for-all it touches on what seems like almost every vision in Western history of a better world, including what Hitler and Stalin imagined.</p>
        <p>So a visitor gets Eden, Renaissance architecture, the discovery of America, Voltaire's ''Candide,'' the Declaration of Independence, the Paris Commune, Quakers, Soviet gulags, streamlined ocean liners, Levittown, the gay rights movement and Woodstock. By the end I found myself wondering why ''Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds'' was included but not Beethoven's Ninth, before I came to my senses. If you make it that far, you may lose track, too.</p>
        <p>But the show has its multiple pleasures and benefits. And as the exhibition makes clear, everyone's idea of utopia is different; so, too, presumably, is everyone's idea of a utopian exhibition.</p>
        <p>The word, we are reminded, was coined in 1516 by Thomas More as a pun meaning both a good place and no place. No place is a perfectly good place. Utopia began from this pessimistic assumption, and one could argue that it has remained on some level a negative concept. As opposed to heaven, it is what people dream about when they have lost faith in the certainty of a paradise to come. It's what we imagine to be perfection in a fallen world, the best of a bad situation.</p>
        <p>The worse the situation, the better. Bloodshed and war have been boons to the utopia industry. The show is full of books and treatises emerging from conflict and chaos.</p>
        <p>Also urban blight. Hellish cities, rapidly expanding during the industrial 19th century and into the 20th, caused architects and civic philosophers to cook up utopian alternatives. Le Corbusier, Bruno Taut, Frank Lloyd Wright, Tony Garnier. Le Corbusier famously wanted to tear down and rebuild Europe from scratch, to remake central Paris as a gigantic housing project of widely spaced skyscrapers. Au revoir, Opera. Howdy, Co-Op City.</p>
        <p>Utopian architecture in this respect has imagined itself to be a sublime engine of social change physically enforced; change the physical conditions of an imperfect thing, a city, and you will make it better. We might think about this for a moment.</p>
        <p>Le Corbusier's vision of a clean, disease-free, perfectly regulated urban environment and Hitler's plan for Berlin as an ethnically cleansed, perfectly obedient capital are not the same thing, but the distinction may not be quite as vast we might want to think.</p>
        <p>Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the planner of Washington, expressed this thought about the model that Jefferson proposed as a design for the capital of the new United States of America: such regular plans might look good on paper, he said, but on the ground they become ''tiresome and insipid.''</p>
        <p>Or worse. Regularity carried to its logical conclusion is oppression. In the show's catalog, Lyman Tower Sargent of the University of Missouri, St. Louis, points out that some historians view Sparta as utopia's fountainhead. This is an alarming thought because it may be true. Sacrifice, labor and renunciation were Sparta's watchwords. They have been become part of utopia's vocabulary.</p>
        <p>Later utopian writers usually promised personal satisfaction for those who stuck to the plan. But the plan still counted above all, which is why utopia and dystopia have not always been easy to tell apart.</p>
        <p>Even exceptional 19th-century utopian reformers like Charles Fourier were basically control addicts, although in some ways Fourier was so odd that one might think he was making a mockery of the idea of utopia, not genuinely imagining it.</p>
        <p>The show has a whole section on socialist thinkers like Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon, Robert Owen and Fourier. Via a kind of private psychological calculus, almost unfathomable now, Fourier divided people into 810 personality types, differently combining what he considered 12 essential passions.</p>
        <p>A Fourierist phalanx, or community, was to have one man and one woman of each type: 1,620 people walking around in uniforms with plumes and epaulettes that he designed to designate the different passions, with everyone trading jobs, sometimes several times a day, and bartering with other phalanxes for goods and living in a constant state of sexual stimulation. Before modern capitalists settled on the minimum wage, Fourier proposed a minimum of sexual pleasure as a condition of citizenship.</p>
        <p>He remains best known as an economic reformer, but one wonders whether he most richly deserves our attention as a utopian speculator in human relations. His colorful legacy is to the vast history of utopian literature roughly what Plato's Retreat is to the history of social custom in New York, and also a reminder that utopia, any way you want to define it, is about desire of one sort or another.</p>
        <p>Somehow, as Fourier illustrates, utopia seems inevitably to slouch toward dystopia. What began with the Garden of Eden and with fantasies of terrestrial paradise became, after the discovery of the New World, speculation about noble savagery and the land of opportunity. The Age of Exploration, which provoked an efflorescence of utopian writing, yielded to reality after the settlers started trying to split up the land. Reveries about perfection on earth soon devolved into colonialism. A clean slate, utopia's most essential component, became another market to exploit.</p>
        <p>So the cycle has evolved. Now we have the Internet, a virtual society, the first real no place, speeding from its original state of infinite promise toward some indefinite commercial end. Cloning has also become reality. And we have become more cynical after a century of dystopian catastrophes.</p>
        <p>But we still keep dreaming, not necessarily because we believe in the idea of a secular utopia's possible fulfillment but because, well, we seem to need to.</p>
        <p>The show's catalog quotes Frederik L. Polak, the Dutch sociologist and utopian philosopher: ''If Western man now stops thinking and dreaming the materials of new images of the future and attempts to shut himself up in the present, out of longing for security and for fear of the future, his civilization will come to an end.</p>
        <p>''He has no choice but to dream or to die, condemning the whole of Western society to die with him.''</p>
        <p>There's an answer. Or maybe we keep dreaming up impossible schemes of perfection to remind ourselves that the real world, in its messiness, is the best thing after all.</p>
