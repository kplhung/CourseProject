        <p>SARAH WUSTNER, a Seattle software engineer, thought about joining the Peace Corps when she graduated from the University of California at San Diego in 1998. But, she said, ''they didn't have anything that really fit my skills.''</p>
        <p>Now, with a stint at Microsoft on her resume, she has taken a leave of absence from her job at Oxygen Media to live in Ghana for three months. Ms. Wustner is part of the pilot team of six volunteers for Geekcorps, a high-tech version of the Peace Corps. Instead of teaching math, as technologically adept Peace Corps workers often do, Ms. Wustner, 24, will help a Ghanaian software company teach its workers the Java and Unix programming languages.</p>
        <p>''I want the satisfaction of feeling that all of the expensive education that I got helped someone in a really real way,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Geekcorps was the idea of Ethan Zuckerman, 27, who made a modest fortune (''enough to buy myself time,'' he said) when the Internet company he helped start, Tripod, was bought by Lycos in 1998. Lacking economic expertise, he consulted with Elisa Korentayer, 25, who has been both an investment banker and a poverty relief worker; she became a co-founder of Geekcorps.</p>
        <p>The idea for Geekcorps came when Mr. Zuckerman was in Ghana in 1993 on a Fulbright fellowship to study African music. Because of a strike at the University of Ghana, he spent a lot of time in the library and noticed that it did not have many books published later than 1957, when Ghana became independent from Britain.</p>
        <p>''I thought, If there was just an Internet connection,'' he said, ''you could more than double this library.''</p>
        <p>In 1999 he left Lycos and began looking for a way to harness the philanthropic urges of his newly rich friends. The budget for Geekcorps's first year, $350,000, was financed largely by Mr. Zuckerman and people he knew from Tripod. Geekcorps is based in North Adams, Mass., in the dot-com corridor of the Berkshires.</p>
        <p>Geekcorps is not unique. Volunteer programs designed to bridge the ''digital divide'' have been proliferating. The term itself, once used primarily to describe the gulf between Internet haves and have-nots within Western countries, refers more and more frequently to the huge disparity in access between the world's economic giants and its fledgling economies. Nearly 400 of every 1,000 Americans are Internet users, according to the International Telecommunication Union, as opposed to 3.5 of every 1,000 Africans.</p>
        <p>Since Aug. 1, the United Nations has sent 37 high-tech volunteers to countries like Benin, Botswana and Ecuador. The State Department's version, called the Global Technology Corps, began in late 1998 and has sponsored more than 20 projects in Kosovo, Nigeria, Poland and other far-flung locales. Still another project, Net Corps America, focuses only on Latin America and the Caribbean. And in August the Peace Corps began to include information technology among its specialties, sending 10 volunteers to Belize.</p>
        <p>These programs reflect the idea, enunciated this summer by the United Nations and the Group of Eight, that the Internet can provide medical information, economic opportunities and online courses that will enable developing countries to leapfrog ahead. But there are an infinite number of ways to chip away at the obstacles to total connectivity, including putting computers in schools and rewriting telecommunications regulations.</p>
        <p>Geekcorps, although tiny, has attracted the attention of people like Denis Gilhooly, the director of information and communications technology for the United Nations Development Program. ''The key to information infrastructure is a dual approach of bottom-up development, exemplified by Geekcorps,'' he said, ''and top-down efforts, which would be exemplified by the UNDP Global Network Readiness and Resource Initiative.'' What Geekcorps is doing, he continued, is ''seeding the next generation of entrepreneurs, and that's invaluable in these countries.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Zuckerman and Ms. Korentayer, who is the Geekcorps program director, said they had been pleasantly surprised by the number of Ghanaian businesses -- including an art gallery, a graphic design firm and a software company -- that asked for help. ''There were so many companies that were so well positioned to receive the kind of help that we can offer,'' Ms. Korentayer said.</p>
        <p>In the future Mr. Zuckerman plans to pursue high-tech companies as donors and to persuade ''venture philanthropists'' like the Noaber Foundation, which gave Geekcorps a grant, to pump capital into Geekcorps's Ghanaian clients.</p>
        <p>The main thing that sets Geekcorps apart from other volunteer efforts, Ms. Korentayer said, is the fact that it was started by dot-com insiders.</p>
        <p>''Geekcorps is far better positioned to appeal to the techie sector in the U.S.,'' Ms. Korentayer said. ''Our competitive advantage is that a lot of techies have heard of us.''</p>
