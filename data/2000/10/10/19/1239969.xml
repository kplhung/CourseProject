        <p>The Israeli soldiers bottled up at this outpost in flak jackets and helmets spend most of their days listening. They listen to the periodic shots that ring out with disconcerting thuds as they slam into the three-foot-thick cement walls around the compound. They listen to the crash of gasoline bombs that send jets of flame skyward. And they listen to their tormentors, who crawl to within a few feet of them, yell ''Death to the Jews!'' in Hebrew, and open fire.</p>
        <p>But it is a curious thing, they say, that despite the night vision scopes, the video camera mounted on a machine gun that lets soldiers in the bunker survey the perimeter and the snipers stationed on a nearby bridge, there is little to look at.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinians sneak up to the edge of the outpost, shoot and disappear,'' said Maj. Moshe Mor, an M-16 assault rifle slung across his flak jacket. ''They fire at us from the window of an apartment and then run to another window. They climb up a tree, let off a shot, then drop to the ground and run. It is a guerrilla war.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the promises agreed upon in Egypt between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the Israeli soldiers at this outpost, which protects a small Israeli settlement, live under siege. They dart across an open yard to avoid shots from an unfinished building next door nicknamed ''the sniper house.'' They do not leave the heavily guarded outpost unless packed inside armored jeeps. And all stand away from the slits in the cement, stuffed with sandbags to form a narrow hole that they can fire from.</p>
        <p>This morning, an officer was wounded when a gasoline bomb exploded at one opening. Two days ago a soldier was shot in the shoulder.  And a series of roadside explosions have rocked army vehicles on an empty stretch of road leading into Israel just a couple miles away.</p>
        <p>Palestinians say Israeli troops like these use excessive force to quell disturbances. And in clashes outside the post today, about 30 Palestinians hurling stones and gasoline bombs were wounded with rubber-coated bullets.</p>
        <p>Oddly, when soldiers shot at the demonstrators, there was no sound, most probably the result of silencers fitted on the ends of the rifles, although the Israeli troops skirted the issue when questioned about it.  They simply acknowledged that they had begun fixing metal tubes on the end of their weapons.</p>
        <p>But the soldiers in Gaza complain that they have been ordered to restrain their fire and are often held back from putting down protests.</p>
        <p>''If we are fired on with live rounds we fire back with live rounds,'' said Asaf Engelstein, 20, as he stood in a gloomy tunnel of concrete blocks as a Palestinian sniper let off three or four shots at the compound. ''The problem is figuring out where to shoot. It is not always easy to see where it is coming from. We are forbidden from shooting indiscriminately.'' And when the Israelis do fire, he said, ''we always use rubber bullets.''</p>
        <p>Sgt. Dennis Kenyazuk, 21, and Pvt. Rafael Leustein, 19, both immigrants to Israel, chatted in Russian as they strapped on their helmets and readied their weapons to leave the compound for a patrol. Outside, plumes of charcoal-black smoke rose from piles of burning tires.</p>
        <p>A Palestinian crowd, a few hundred yards away, protested. They chanted ''God is Great!'' in Arabic and rained stones and gasoline bombs on the perimeter.</p>
        <p>The Russian immigrants bolted shut the doors after being joined by Major Mor and another soldier. Sergeant Kenyazuk accelerated the jeep through the gate but stopped suddenly when a yellow Palestinian taxi barreled toward them.</p>
        <p>The soldiers, in unison, raised the barrels of their assault rifles.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinians have a new trick,'' said Major Mor, who is 27.  ''They fire on us from moving cars.  It happens quite often now. We are pretty well protected, but they have been shooting at civilian cars and buses.''</p>
        <p>The jeep, once the car passed, snaked around the gantlet of burning tires and stones. When two Palestinian cars approached from behind the jeep slowed to let them pass, again the soldiers tensed.</p>
        <p>But it was the last desolate stretch of road into Israel that seemed to unnerve them. More than a half dozen blasts have been ignited on this stretch of road in the last few days.</p>
        <p>''No one travels this part of the highway except Israelis,'' Major Mor said, ''and this is where they have begun placing roadside bombs. They plant them here at night. We dismantled one, made out of a mortar shell, the other day. If it were not for our armored vehicles, some of us would not be around.''</p>
        <p>As he spoke, two young men darted out from the undergrowth and threw large chunks of concrete at the jeep. One piece smashed into the front window.</p>
        <p>As the army vehicle sped away the young men, jubilant, danced on the road and taunted the soldiers with their fists.</p>
