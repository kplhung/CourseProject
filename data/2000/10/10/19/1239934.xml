        <p>By stuffing a Power PC microprocessor chip into a Zip drive, the Iomega Corporation has created a gadget that allows digital camera owners to use their television, rather than a computer, to view their snapshots. ''The television is really a natural place to view photos,'' said Robert Puzey, product manager for the Iomega FotoShow Digital Image Center.</p>
        <p>After connecting the FotoShow, which looks like a 250-megabyte Zip drive, to any TV set, users of cameras with either Compact Flash or SmartMedia storage cards can directly transfer photos. The FotoShow stores those images, in turn, on standard 100-MB or 250-MB Zip disks.</p>

        <p>By stuffing a Power PC microprocessor chip into a Zip drive, the Iomega Corporation has created a gadget that allows digital camera owners to use their television, rather than a computer, to view their snapshots. ''The television is really a natural place to view photos,'' said Robert Puzey, product manager for the Iomega FotoShow Digital Image Center.</p>
        <p>After connecting the FotoShow, which looks like a 250-megabyte Zip drive, to any TV set, users of cameras with either Compact Flash or SmartMedia storage cards can directly transfer photos. The FotoShow stores those images, in turn, on standard 100-MB or 250-MB Zip disks.</p>
        <p>Once the photos are loaded, users can retreat to the sofa. A special remote control combined with a software chip in the FotoShow unit allows  basic photo editing, including cropping and red-eye removal, on the television screen. Users can also assemble their pictures into digital albums with the remote.</p>
        <p>The FotoShow can be plugged into any computer running Windows or the Macintosh operating system through a U.S.B. port to allow users to download images from the Web, a scanner or cameras that use other storage systems. The internal photo editing software, however, only works on the TV set. ''We think that most people already have imaging software on their computers,'' Mr. Puzey said.</p>
        <p>When connected to a computer, the $299 FotoShow can also be used like a regular Zip drive to store any kind of data. Mr. Puzey is hoping that the device will open up digital photography to people who don't have a computer and don't want to acquire one.</p>
        <p>''Now Grandma can get a digital camera and easily enjoy the pictures she's taken,'' he said.</p>
