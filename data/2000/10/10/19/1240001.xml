        <p>Britain ordered its high-speed trains to slow down on some sections of the nation's railroads today, a day after part of a train traveling 115 miles an hour derailed and killed four people and injured 35.</p>
        <p>As an investigation into the accident continued today, the company responsible for maintaining the railroad system said the derailment, one of a number of fatal railroad accidents in recent years, had been caused possibly by a broken section of track.</p>
        <p>''It is evident that the rail has been broken and has been smashed,'' Nicholas Pollard, a spokesman for the company, Railtrack, told Sky Television. But, he added, the company was investigating whether the broken section was the cause, or the result, of the accident.</p>
        <p>Investigators ruled out terrorism as a cause, in spite of a bomb threat against another railroad line this week. They said neither the wreckage nor the crash site showed signs of an explosion.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Railtrack acknowledged that a section of track involved in the crash, at Hatfield in Hertfordshire, was in poor condition and was to have been replaced in November. The section, made of mill-heated steel designed to be hard enough to use on high-speed curves, was repaired last month as an interim step to prevent cracks. ''While the investigation is still at an early stage, it would appear that whatever the cause of the accident, the condition of the track was not good,'' the company said.</p>
        <p>A series of reports has faulted Railtrack for lax maintenance in its role of overseeing the tracks, switches, signals, stations and safety systems.</p>
        <p>In December, Britain's chief railway inspector, Vic Coleman, said large sections of the railroad system had fallen into disrepair. Last year, the system reported 949 instances of broken rails and 64 buckled rails. And a train crash near Paddington Station a year ago, which left 31 people dead, occurred after a train had passed a red signal and plowed into another train. The signal, which was difficult to see, had been the subject of numerous complaints to Railtrack but had not been repaired.</p>
