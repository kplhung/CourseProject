        <p>Darryl Hamilton grew up in Louisiana, Turk Wendell in Massachusetts. They had one thing in common: an abiding distaste for and confusion about New York sports fans.</p>
        <p>When Hamilton followed sports, he rooted not just for hometown teams but for teams throughout the South. The biggest rivalry Hamilton knew was Southern versus Grambling in college football.</p>
        <p>''Southern fans would every once in a while pull for Grambling, and vice versa,'' Hamilton, the Mets outfielder, said. ''But here, uh-uh. I don't see it happening.''</p>
        <p>Wendell was an avid Boston Red Sox fan, and said he could not understand the hostility he perceived between Mets and Yankees fans.</p>
        <p>''I really hope that the fans of New York just understand it's a New York team, and be happy with that,'' Wendell said. ''Why can't they cheer for both teams? I just hope people appreciate what's going on and enjoy it, rather than splitting up families.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton spent more than a decade in the majors before Colorado traded him to the Mets last year.</p>
        <p>''Being on the visiting side for so many years, you think it could be a prison term if I'm sent to play for the Mets or the Yankees, because of the fast-paced lifestyle here in New York,'' Hamilton said. ''Everybody likes to get away from the game once in a while. You can't do it here. But when you get here on one of the teams, you realize how important it is and how much fun you have.''</p>
        <p>Wendell said: ''I always said the two teams in baseball I never, ever wanted to play for were the Mets and Yankees. I guess the baseball gods got me, but it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened in my career. A lot of people are afraid to play here because the fans put so many expectations on players. For me, it makes me thrive on it.''</p>
