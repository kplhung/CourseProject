        <p>Investors, watch out. There's a Subway Series coming. And that has meant, in the past anyway, that the stock market will most likely have a subpar year. Even worse, the Mets are going to be in it. When the Mets make it to the World Series, it is usually a good time to get out of the stock market.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that reflects the fact that New York, the financial capital of the country, is distracted from its usual focus -- making money -- by the excitement of an interborough fight for baseball dominance, or even by the novelty of seeing the often-hapless Mets winning a pennant.</p>

        <p>Investors, watch out. There's a Subway Series coming. And that has meant, in the past anyway, that the stock market will most likely have a subpar year. Even worse, the Mets are going to be in it. When the Mets make it to the World Series, it is usually a good time to get out of the stock market.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that reflects the fact that New York, the financial capital of the country, is distracted from its usual focus -- making money -- by the excitement of an interborough fight for baseball dominance, or even by the novelty of seeing the often-hapless Mets winning a pennant.</p>
        <p>Or, more likely, it means nothing at all. The idea that baseball results should affect the stock market is not, on its face, an especially reasonable one.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the record is there, and the Dow did have a bad day yesterday, the day after the Yankee victory Tuesday night confirmed that there would be a Subway Series.</p>
        <p>This will be the 14th subway World Series, albeit the first since 1956 and the first involving the Mets. After, the previous 13 such series, 10 won by the Yankees, two by the New York Giants and one by the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by an average of 6 percent from the end of October through the end of the following October, when a new World Series champion was crowned.</p>
        <p>That is not a horrible performance, but it is not nearly as good as the record in years when there was not a Subway Series. In those years, encompassing the years following 82 World Series (the Series wasn't played in 1904 and 1994), the average gain has been 7.6 percent.</p>
        <p>In other words, having a Subway Series means that the stock market will, on average, do 1.6 percentage points less well than if there is not a Subway Series.</p>
        <p>The Mets have never been in a Subway Series before, and they have only been in three previous Series. The first came in 1969, during what was then the longest economic expansion in American history, one that had lasted more than eight years. As it happened, that expansion ended a month after the Mets had surprisingly beaten the Baltimore Orioles, and a recession began in December 1969. By the end of October 1970, the Dow was down 11.7 percent. The current economic expansion, which is now more than nine years old, has replaced the 1961 to 1969 period as the longest expansion in history.</p>
        <p>The next Mets appearance in the World Series came in 1973, when they lost to the Oakland A's. That same month saw an Arab-Israeli war, followed by an Arab oil embargo. Oil prices shot up to previously unheard of heights and the economy fell into a recession in November, the month after the Mets lost the World Series. By the end of October 1974, the Dow was down 30.4 percent as Wall Street entered its worst bear market since the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>The Mets' third World Series appearance -- and the only one not quickly followed by a recession -- came in 1986, when the Mets defeated the Boston Red Sox. The stock market rallied impressively in the months after that series -- only to crash in October 1987. Still, the stock market ended October 1987 up 6.2 percent from a year earlier. That is a bit below par, but a lot better than after the Mets' first two World Series appearances.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have, of course, been in more World Series than any other team. This will be the 37th World Series featuring the Bronx Bombers, who have won 25 World Series. In general, a Yankee World Series appearance has been a good omen for the stock market -- so long as the National League was represented by a team from out of town. In the years after a Yankee appearance against a non-New York team, the Dow has risen by an average of 12.4 percent, or more than twice as well as it has done following the average Subway Series.</p>
        <p>The most recent Subway Series, in 1956, also came during the month of an Arab-Israeli war -- this one the Israeli invasion of the Sinai Peninsula after Egypt had seized the Suez Canal. The Yankees won that series, and the stock market fell 8.1 percent over the next year.</p>
        <p>In fact, whether the opponent was from New York, the Dow has tended to do better when the Yankees lost in the World Series than when they won. And while the market has not done very well after any Mets appearances, its worst showing was after the Series they lost. The conclusion: any investor who believes that baseball can influence the stock market should be rooting for the Mets.</p>
