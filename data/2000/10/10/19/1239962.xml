        <p>Some investors gave up and got out yesterday morning, creating one of the worst openings ever for the American stock market. Prices soon rallied, but the Dow Jones industrial average still closed under 10,000 for the first time since March.</p>
        <p>The wild gyrations reflected one of the most confused and divided stock markets in memory, in which hopes that the market is about to rise again are balanced by worries that weakness in technology stocks may presage a bear market and a sharp slowing in the economy that will decimate corporate profits.</p>
        <p>''People are asking themselves if this is the end of the sell-off,'' said William Rhodes, the chief equity strategist for Williams Capital. At the same time, he added, there is fear that stock prices had reflected overly optimistic expectations about earnings growth in coming years.</p>
        <p>During the last six weeks, stock prices have fallen sharply across much of the market, with some well-known stocks, like Yahoo and Apple Computer, losing more than half their value amid signs that growth is slowing for many technology companies. That weakness, amplified into 80 percent or larger declines for some smaller stocks, has led to forced selling as some investors tried to contain their losses.</p>
        <p>Worries about high oil prices -- which were intensified by a report of low inventories released Tuesday night -- also have contributed to the nervousness of investors. Oil for November delivery rose 49 cents yesterday to $33.48 a barrel.</p>
        <p>At the opening yesterday, the selling was intense. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 435 points, or 4.3 percent, within the first 19 minutes of trading, bottoming at 9,654.64. The more volatile Nasdaq composite index was off 5.8 percent.</p>
        <p>And then the market turned around. Within a couple of hours, the Nasdaq index had erased its entire loss and was up a bit for the day. The Dow was still down, but all of the decline could be attributed to two stocks with bad news: I.B.M. and J. P. Morgan. I.B.M. reported disappointing revenue while J. P. Morgan was hurt by losses in venture capital investments at Chase Manhattan, which is acquiring Morgan.</p>
        <p>By the close, the Dow was down 114.69 points, to 9,975.02. But nearly all of that decline was caused by I.B.M., and there were as many Dow stocks with gains as there were with losses. The Nasdaq index ended down 1.3 percent, a relatively small move in this very volatile time, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was off just over 0.5 percent.</p>
        <p>The Wall Street rebound had immediate international effects as well. European stocks, which had been sliding, generally turned around  about the same time. But, perhaps in an indication that some of the buying of American stocks came from abroad, the euro also began to fall, hitting a record low against the dollar for the first time since central banks intervened to support the currency last month. The euro traded as low as 83.3 cents.</p>
        <p>I.B.M., which ended the day down $17.56, to $95.44 a share, disappointed investors with a profit report that showed revenue running below expectations. But even as I.B.M. was plunging in early trading, the Dow was getting some support from Intel, which ended up $2, to $38.19. Its actual profit report was not as bad as it had led analysts to fear last month, and that strength helped to buoy investors.</p>
        <p>''You do see companies that are trying to find bottoms here,'' said Giri Devalupally, a technology analyst at T. Rowe Price, a mutual fund company. He pointed to the gains yesterday in both Intel and Dell Computer, each of which has lost more than half its value since peaking earlier in the year.</p>
        <p>Coming into yesterday, much attention was focused on Sun Microsystems, which was scheduled to release profits after the market closed. But in mid-morning it put a bullish headline about its earnings on its Internet site, sending the stock leaping 10 percent, to $118.75, in 20 minutes, as analysts struggled to extrapolate the underlying profit numbers from a headline. Trading was soon halted, and the full profit release was issued. Sun rose a bit more, then sagged as some analysts voiced concern that its gross profit margins had fallen. By the close, the shares were back down to $110.31, off $1.06 for the day.</p>
        <p>Even while technology stocks have bounced wildly in recent weeks on each new piece of evidence regarding the state of demand, other shares have been helped by the fact that optimism for the overall stock market remains strong among many investors.</p>
        <p>Ever since the 1987 crash -- whose 13th anniversary is today -- big falls in stocks have been viewed as buying opportunities, and investors have been willing to come in when prices fall sharply. Ameritrade, an online brokerage firm, reported that during the nine trading sessions before yesterday, its traders were net buyers on every day except last Friday, when some took profits on a strong rebound that gave the Nasdaq market its second-best day ever.</p>
        <p>David Bowers, the chief global investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, noted that some investors were taking heart from the fact that both the Dow and the Nasdaq indexes had approached the spring lows last week, and again yesterday, before stabilizing and turning up.</p>
        <p>Trying to analyze the market now is difficult because the end of October is the time that most mutual funds close their tax books for the year. That has created selling pressure as some funds have taken capital losses that can be used to offset capital gains taken earlier in the year on other stocks.</p>
        <p>Just which stock funds have losses  can vary widely, reflecting the huge gains many had before stocks began to fall. Lucent Technologies, for example, is down more than two-thirds from the high it reached late last year, but it is still trading for more than twice its value of four years ago. Intel is down about half from the peak it reached in September, but is still twice where it was two years ago. Microsoft traded at a two-year low this week for the first time in its history, but is still far above where it was three or four years ago.</p>
        <p>All those stocks still have Wall Street adherents and clearly will remain major companies for years to come. The worst losses have come as nearly all investors have abandoned some of last year's Internet plays. For example, Stamps.com, a company that sells postage over the Internet, has seen turmoil in top management ranks and now sells for less than $3 a share, down from a high of $98.50 last November and less than half the amount of cash per share the company has in the bank.</p>
