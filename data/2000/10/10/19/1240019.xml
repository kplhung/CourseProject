        <p>In a testy rebuttal to recent news reports that New Jersey law enforcement officials concealed evidence of racial profiling for years, Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. suggested today that some unnamed adversaries of the state police were trying to tarnish the reputation of the agency and derail his attempts to overhaul the force.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer became attorney general in May 1999, less than a month after Gov. Christine Todd Whitman acknowledged for the first time that many troopers had illegally targeted minority drivers because of their skin color, and much of his time in office has been spent addressing profiling. In December he agreed to let a monitor appointed by a federal court oversee the state's efforts to deter profiling.</p>

        <p>In a testy rebuttal to recent news reports that New Jersey law enforcement officials concealed evidence of racial profiling for years, Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. suggested today that some unnamed adversaries of the state police were trying to tarnish the reputation of the agency and derail his attempts to overhaul the force.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer became attorney general in May 1999, less than a month after Gov. Christine Todd Whitman acknowledged for the first time that many troopers had illegally targeted minority drivers because of their skin color, and much of his time in office has been spent addressing profiling. In December he agreed to let a monitor appointed by a federal court oversee the state's efforts to deter profiling.</p>
        <p>An assortment of civil lawsuits alleging racial profiling have moved through the courts, and a judge recently ordered the state police to turn over 50,000 pages of internal documents to plaintiffs' lawyers. Last month, Mr. Farmer took the unusual step of announcing that he would also make those documents available to the public by establishing a profiling archive.</p>
        <p>Those plans were disrupted last week, however, when newspapers obtained 11,000 pages of those records, including memos indicating that the state police superintendent, Col. Carl A. Williams, had detailed statistical evidence of profiling as early as the fall of 1996, and that the attorney general at the time, Peter G. Verniero, participated in a January 1997 meeting with state police officials at which they decided to limit what was given to federal investigators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verniero, who is now a justice on the State Supreme Court, has declined to comment on the matter, even as state legislators have begun investigating whether he misrepresented his knowledge about racial profiling in testimony during his confirmation hearings in May 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer insisted today that when all 50,000 pages of the documents were available, it would be apparent that his predecessors in the attorney general's office had cooperated fully with investigators.</p>
        <p>''There is no insinuation by the Justice Department that we didn't cooperate, that we withheld information,'' Mr. Farmer said at a news conference in the Statehouse. ''You can pick out the documents that have been leaked and it would look that way. But when all the documents are out there, you can see what we've shown what we've sent the Justice Department on a regular basis over the years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer added that he was ''offended'' that only selected documents had been provided to the newspapers and suggested that the leaks had been intended to counter a recent report by the federal monitor that praised the state's efforts to discourage profiling.</p>
        <p>He said he did not know who might have released the information or wish to impede the agency's overhaul.</p>
        <p>State legislators from both parties have called for an inquiry into profiling and whether Mr. Verniero misled lawmakers during his confirmation hearings. Senator William L. Gormley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has asked a former United States attorney, Michael Chertoff, to review the evidence and begin questioning state officials. Mr. Gormley said he would decide later whether to call for public hearings or ask for subpoena power.</p>
        <p>Democrats have been pushing for a more aggressive response. The Senate minority leader, Richard Codey, has asked the Senate to form a special committee, with subpoena power, to examine the documents.</p>
