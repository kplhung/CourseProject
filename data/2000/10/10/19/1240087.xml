        <p>The battle over Yankee television rights is back in court.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, the team withdrew its estimated $1.4 billion offer for Cablevision's MSG Network to renew its Yankee rights after Cablevision filed a revised complaint in New York State Supreme Court saying the offer was unfair.</p>
        <p>''We're through negotiating and pontificating,'' said Lonn Trost, the Yankees' chief operating officer. ''The appropriate jurist will make the decision.''</p>
        <p>Last July the Yankees entered a 10-year, $900 million deal with the International Management Group to create a Yankee cable television network. But that agreement was contingent upon giving MSG the right to match it.</p>
        <p>But State Supreme Court Judge Barry A. Cozier ruled that the Yankees' offer did not comply with MSG's matching rights and ordered the team to devise a new one. The Yankees presented the offer in September, but a continuing dispute over how to value it kept both sides from negotiating a resolution.</p>
        <p>Trost said he was planning to submit a new offer that would have cut the future value of MSG's 10-year payments to $1.5 billion, but MSG said it was willing to pay only $500 million, a shade less than the $493.5 million it has paid under a 12-year contract that recently expired.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees prevail, they will start the network. If a resolution is reached with MSG, MSG will keep carrying the Yankees as it has since 1989.</p>
