        <p>Ann Powers reviews performance by David Thomas and Pere Ubu rock band, at Knitting Factory (S)</p>

        <p>In a red apron and dripping sweat, David Thomas looked like a post-punk Sweeney Todd at Pere Ubu's 25th-anniversary show Saturday at the Knitting Factory. Instead of barbering and butchering human customers, though, he led that storied Cleveland punk band in making a fine meat pie of rock as a way of taking the knife to his own big heart.</p>
        <p>Pere Ubu created its own sphere within American underground rock. Although it had peers in bands like Television and the early Talking Heads, no group blended noise and lyricism to such startling effect. Mr. Thomas has a forceful tenor that falls somewhere between the angelic and the animal; in Pere Ubu, it floats heavily over a barrage of melodic noise. Songs like ''30 Seconds Over Tokyo'' and ''Final Solution'' (a reference not to Nazism, Mr. Thomas says, but to a Sherlock Holmes mystery) evoked an existential dread that somehow tore through itself to become beautiful.</p>

        <p>In a red apron and dripping sweat, David Thomas looked like a post-punk Sweeney Todd at Pere Ubu's 25th-anniversary show Saturday at the Knitting Factory. Instead of barbering and butchering human customers, though, he led that storied Cleveland punk band in making a fine meat pie of rock as a way of taking the knife to his own big heart.</p>
        <p>Pere Ubu created its own sphere within American underground rock. Although it had peers in bands like Television and the early Talking Heads, no group blended noise and lyricism to such startling effect. Mr. Thomas has a forceful tenor that falls somewhere between the angelic and the animal; in Pere Ubu, it floats heavily over a barrage of melodic noise. Songs like ''30 Seconds Over Tokyo'' and ''Final Solution'' (a reference not to Nazism, Mr. Thomas says, but to a Sherlock Holmes mystery) evoked an existential dread that somehow tore through itself to become beautiful.</p>
        <p>At the Knitting Factory, the latest of many Pere Ubu lineups slashed through a wide-ranging set with energetic care. This group includes one other original member, the guitarist Tom Herman, whose solos ranged from an eerie slide blues to a graceful dissection of art-rock metal.</p>
        <p>These solos entered an atmosphere made stormy by the theremin and synthesizers of Robert Wheeler, crackling machines that unassumingly filled any space between notes. The music's forceful base came from the drummer Steve Mehlman and the bassist Michele Temple, who shifted from dub reggae rhythms to surf and even a country twang.</p>
        <p>The defining presence, however, was Mr. Thomas, clad in a red plastic apron equipped with tone-altering microphones through which he created wild effects by bear-hugging a nearby amplifier. Despite this shtick, the singer was sterner this evening than sometimes, playing his usual tragic-clown role with a willful heaviness. ''Thank you for allowing me to bare my tragedy and my personal life,'' he said, but the line felt de rigueur. Mr. Thomas has been singing about loneliness for so long that it he has rendered it a spiritual exercise.</p>
        <p>He spoke of Pere Ubu's career as a ''long, slow slide into weirdness and decay.'' He was certainly referring to the band's commercial marginality, but his words also shed light on what makes its music so great. Throughout his long, ever mutating career, Mr. Thomas has stayed with the uneasy aspects of life -- from heartbreak to simple embarrassment -- staring them down until they reveal some kind of grace. He makes his noisy incisions in the service of life.</p>
