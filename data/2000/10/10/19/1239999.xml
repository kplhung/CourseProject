        <p>Under pressure from Congress to disclose campus crimes more fully, American colleges are rushing to release new crime statistics by a federal deadline of Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Government officials are posting  all university crime records on the Internet and can fine colleges $25,000 for each unreported crime.</p>
        <p>With the majority of 6,700 colleges and universities waiting until the last minute to post their figures, the Department of Education's system for receiving the data crashed last Friday. It was restored on Saturday, but  the deadline initially set for sending statistics in by last Tuesday was put off a week.</p>
        <p>''Because there were a significant number of changes this year, people were waiting to see the Web site,'' said Terry Gorman, director of security and environmental health at Macalaster College in St. Paul. ''Everybody sort of hung out to the bitter end.''</p>
        <p>The Web site for the crime statistics is www.ope.ed.gov/security.</p>
        <p>The move to make crime reports available through the Internet, which is designed to help parents, students and employees gauge safety at colleges and universities, comes a decade after Congress first passed a measure requiring colleges to compile annual reports of campus crimes.</p>
        <p>The law was named for Jeanne Clery, a 19-year-old student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., who was raped, beaten and killed in her dormitory room in 1986. After Ms. Clery's death, her parents learned that 38 violent crimes that had not been made public had occurred at the Lehigh campus in the three years before their daughter was killed.</p>
        <p>Since passage of the 1990 law, however, government reviews have shown haphazard compliance, with little uniformity in how colleges defined crimes and how they determined which to include in their reports. There was little agreement on which areas surrounding colleges fell under the federal reporting law.</p>
        <p>A 1997 study by the General Accounting Office found the Education Department slow to monitor compliance with the 1990 campus security law and said it had not fined a single college for failure to report a crime.  In addition, a report on campus crime that Congress ordered the department to send it by September 1995 did not arrive until February 1997.</p>
        <p>The next year, Congress toughened the laws, closing loopholes, raising fines and requiring statistics to be forwarded to the Department of Education and to be made public.</p>
        <p>''It's more than a wake-up call,''  Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said. ''It's more than a shot across the bow. It's a shot into the bow.''</p>
        <p>Jane Glickman, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the department had submitted seven reports to Congress on compliance with campus security laws in past years.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the department is taking steps that foreshadow tougher enforcement of the law. Last week it announced an investigation of the University of California System and the California State University System after a series of articles in The Sacramento Bee reported a pattern of underreporting sexual assaults. The universities deny underreporting crime. This summer, the department levied its first $25,000 fine for failure to report a crime, on Mount St. Clare College, in Iowa. The college is appealing the decision.</p>
        <p>Mark Goodman, executive director of the Student Press Law Center, which represents student newspapers, said: ''When you can get on line in two minutes and do a comparison of a handful of schools that you're considering applying to, that means you'll have more students and parents who are informed. My guess is that schools will be nervous.''</p>
        <p>Myra Kodner, a program coordinator for Security on Campus, a Pennsylvania-based watchdog group financed by Ms. Clery's parents, said that some colleges feared that parents would send their children elsewhere if they were honest about campus crime.</p>
