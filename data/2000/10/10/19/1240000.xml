        <p>The Justice Department is examining the business practices of the major wholesalers who deliver 90 percent of the magazines to newsstands in the United States, according to magazine industry executives and Justice Department officials.</p>
        <p>The department's antitrust division has already taken action against some of the smaller players in the wholesale business. The inquiry began about five years ago, but in recent months has begun to focus on the  major companies, the executives and officials said.</p>
        <p>The scrutiny comes as the magazine industry is rumbling with concern about the effects of wholesaler consolidation. Many publishers complain that wholesalers are squeezing their profits by charging too much to distribute their magazines. They also say a sharp decline in the number of wholesalers has made it more difficult to distribute less-popular magazines to smaller retailers -- as opposed to chain stores that favor best-selling titles -- thus leading to fewer choices for consumers.</p>
        <p>Wholesalers say they are losing money because publishers are paying too little for distribution of their magazines and that the retailers are also demanding increasingly tougher terms.</p>
        <p>For various reasons, including competition from other forms of media, newsstand sales for magazines have dropped in the last two decades. The decline has accelerated in the last five years, a fact that publishers attribute, at least in part, to wholesaler consolidation.</p>
        <p>The number of wholesalers began to drop sharply in 1995, when approximately 180 distributed magazines. By 1998, 60 were left. In 1999, five dominated almost the entire market. Then one of them -- United Magazine Company, or Unimag -- folded, and now there are just four: the Anderson News Corporation, which is based in Knoxville, Tenn.; the News Group, which is operated by the Jim Pattison Group of Vancouver, British Columbia; the Hudson News Company of North Bergen, N.J.; and the Chas. Levy Circulating Company of Chicago. Anderson has the largest share with almost 40 percent of the market, industry analysts said.</p>
        <p>The inquiry is seeking, in part, to determine whether any company sought to eliminate competition. Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said she had no comment on the investigation. But magazine industry executives involved in the inquiry said Anderson and Chas. Levy had been asked to  supply documents to the Justice Department regarding billing, shipping and freight. Anderson has been asked to hand over documentation going back at least several years.</p>
        <p>Joel R. Anderson, the chairman of Anderson, confirmed this week that the Justice Department had subpoenaed documents, and that, as he understood it, an extensive investigation of the industry was under way.</p>
        <p>''We have been asked for documents, we have cooperated and we will continue to do so,'' Mr. Anderson said.</p>
        <p>The general counsel of Chas. Levy, Beth Corvino, declined to discuss the inquiry. Hudson executives did not return phone calls seeking comment. Michael J. Korenberg, a managing director of the Pattison News Group, said he was aware of the general investigation into the industry but did not know if his company was under scrutiny. He said that as far as he knew no documents had been requested.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, the Justice Department has taken action against four smaller companies. Earlier this month, a federal grand jury indicted a Dallas wholesaler, Martin News Agency, and its former co-owner,  Bennett T. Martin, charging that the company had participated in a conspiracy with other wholesalers to divide distribution territories and customers for the sale of magazines in Dallas, Fort Worth and surrounding areas. An arraignment is scheduled next week.</p>
        <p>Three other companies were charged with anticompetitive practices: C &amp; S News Agency Inc. of Waxahachie, Tex.; Island Periodicals L.L.C. of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands; and Rack Shop, of Dallas-Fort Worth. Each paid fines,  ranging from $80,000 to $750,000.</p>
        <p>The consolidation took hold in the mid-1990's after the grocery store chain Safeway Inc. told wholesalers in several states that it preferred to service its national chain with fewer wholesalers, rather than dealing with wholesalers city by city. Several large regions of the country were then opened to competitive bidding. Other major national retailers, like Wal-Mart and Publix, followed Safeway. Unable to offer competitive prices, many wholesalers shut down.</p>
