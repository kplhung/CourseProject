        <p>The third and final scheduled debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday night was watched by slightly more people than watched their debate last week, figures released yesterday by Nielsen Media Research showed.</p>
        <p>About 37.7 million people saw the debate on the major broadcast and cable news networks, Nielsen reported. The Oct. 11 meeting between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush was watched by 37.5 million people, the second-smallest audience on record for a televised presidential debate. Their first debate, on Oct. 3, was watched by at least 46.6 million people, Nielsen said.</p>
        <p>The least-watched debate on record was the second one between President Clinton and Bob Dole on Oct. 16, 1996. It was watched by 36.3 million people. The most-watched presidential debate on record was the Oct. 28, 1980, confrontation between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. It had an audience of 80.6 million people.</p>
        <p>The ratings for the debate on Tuesday night were clearly affected by competing programming on other broadcast networks. Instead of showing the debate live, Fox showed an episode of its new science fiction drama, ''Dark Angel,'' which was watched by more than 13 million people. Some Fox stations showed the debate later on tape.</p>
        <p>Many NBC stations also showed the debate on tape after the deciding game of the American League championship series.</p>
        <p>But those who did tune in to watch the debate live seemed to find it compelling enough to stick with it. In fact, the audiences on ABC and CBS each grew by about 1.5 million people from the debate's beginning at 9 p.m. to its conclusion at 10:33 p.m., according to figures from those networks.</p>
        <p>Network researches surmised that the audiences grew in part as people arrived home from work on the West Coast, where the debate began at 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>The Nielsen audience figures do not include people who watched the debate on PBS or C-Span. PBS estimated that 3.1 million watched the debate on its member stations. C-Span had no audience estimates.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VIEWERS  Correction:  October 20, 2000, Friday  A headline yesterday about television ratings for the three debates between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore misstated viewership for the last one, on Tuesday. It drew more viewers than the Oct. 11 debate, but not more than the one on Oct. 3.</p>
