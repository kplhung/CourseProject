        <p>The United Center had all the vibrancy of a wax museum after-hours tonight, and the play on the ice was not much better. But that did not keep the Rangers from snapping a two-game losing streak with a 4-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>

        <p>The United Center had all the vibrancy of a wax museum after-hours tonight, and the play on the ice was not much better. But that did not keep the Rangers from snapping a two-game losing streak with a 4-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>
        <p>''It looked like a preseason game,'' Rangers center Tim Taylor said.</p>
        <p>Goalie Kirk McLean turned in a brilliant third period in his final start in goal before Mike Richter makes his long-awaited return from knee surgery. McLean also made the most of the first-period goals from Adam Graves and Valery Kamensky.</p>
        <p>Jan Hlavac put the game away at 10 minutes 5 seconds of the final period with his second goal of the season. Hlavac, with a backhanded stab, was able to sweep a rebound past Chicago goalie Rob Tallas from the low slot. And the Czech line of Hlavac, Petr Nedved and Radek Dvorak finally had something to show for a dominating evening.</p>
        <p>Theo Fleury added an empty-net goal for the Rangers, his fourth goal of the season, with one minute remaining in the game, rendering Dean McAmmond's goal for Chicago with 30.8 seconds to play meaningless.</p>
        <p>The Rangers held on to pick up their third victory in five games behind 38 saves from McLean.</p>
        <p>''We didn't play very well in the third, but Kirk was equal to the task,'' Coach Ron Low said of McLean, who turned aside 19 of 20 shots in the final period.</p>
        <p>Mark Messier, who delivered a picture-perfect feed to free Kamensky on his goal said, ''We were good at the right times tonight.''</p>
        <p>Not that there were many people around to notice. Old Chicago Stadium used to be known as the loudest arena in the league. Its successor, United Center, was among the emptiest tonight.  The announced attendance was 12,806. But the cavernous building, which has a capacity of 20,500, was half full, at best. There were empty seats everywhere for this matchup of Original Six teams celebrating their 75th season.</p>
        <p>So much for nostalgia.</p>
        <p>''It's been a long time where I've played a game in Chicago that didn't have the atmosphere you're accustomed to seeing here,'' Messier said.</p>
        <p>The Rangers took a 2-1 lead into the third period, and by that time, even fewer people were in the building. All the goals had been scored in the first period. Either the ice was bad or it was the play itself, but players on both sides stumbled.</p>
        <p>The Rangers opened the scoring 9:37 into the game when Graves scored on a slap shot, which he seldom does. The goal was the first of the season for Graves, who has scored the majority of goals over his career from in front of the net. This one came from the top of the left circle, and the shot sailed over Tallas's right shoulder.</p>
        <p>The Blackhawks tied it at 12:39 of the first, when Steve Sullivan deked his way past Brian Leetch on a two-on-two break. Sullivan faked outside and Leetch bit. Sullivan then went inside, bore down on McLean alone and roofed a shot past him.</p>
        <p>Then, with time running out in the period, Messier somehow threaded a pass through what seemed like the entire Chicago squad in the neutral zone. Messier's pass -- which went blue line to blue line and was extremely close to being a two-line pass -- freed Kamensky in all alone on Tallas for the breakaway.</p>
        <p>Kamensky waited, waited and waited until Tallas finally went down to the ice. With Tallas sprawled across the goal line, Kamensky lifted a wrist shot over him from just off the right post. And, at 19:40 of the first, the Rangers had regained the lead.</p>
        <p>The time of the goal was a familiar number to longtime Rangers fans. For most of the second half of the 20th century, 1940 meant the last time the Rangers won the Stanley Cup. The stigma was erased in 1994. Now the Blackhawks, who last won it all in 1961, hold the dubious distinction of having gone the longest without winning the Cup.</p>
        <p>Neither the Blackhawks nor the Rangers have qualified for the playoffs the last three seasons.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DREW BANNISTER was the sixth defenseman Wednesday night and he did not embarrass himself. But it will probably not be long before MIKE MOTTAU is summoned from Hartford to make his National Hockey League debut. ''Mike Mottau may not be ready for us right now, but we may be ready for him,'' Rangers Coach RON LOW said at the morning skate.</p>
        <p>After missing the first five games of the season, goalie MIKE RICHTER will make his first appearance on Sunday night at Madison Square Garden against the Tampa Bay Lightning. ''Ricky's playing against Tampa,'' Low said. ''We decided that a long, long time ago.''</p>
