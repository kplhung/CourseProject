        <p>A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's and a target of the government's investigation into auction-house collusion, won a judge's approval yesterday for access to information described as crucial to his case.</p>
        <p>''There's too much foot-dragging in this case,'' said the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who rejected two motions to delay the turnover of records produced in a class-action lawsuit brought by customers of Sotheby's and its archrival, Christie's.</p>
        <p>Buyers and sellers say they were cheated by the two auction houses, which have acknowledged coordinating commission fees that were charged to customers. The two houses agreed to settle the case last month by paying  plaintiffs a total of $512 million but have not signed legal papers solidifying the deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taubman and his lawyers have sought documents and other information that was provided to Christie's and prosecutors by a former chief executive of Christie's, Christopher M. Davidge, who came forward late last year with accounts of collusive behavior.</p>
        <p>Joseph Linklater, a lawyer for Mr. Davidge, moved unsuccessfully to block the turnover of Mr. Davidge's material as a possible risk to his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
