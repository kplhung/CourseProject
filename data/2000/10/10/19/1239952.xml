        <p>Whitman Hobbs, an advertising agency executive and columnist whose voice was heard interviewing advertisers in television and radio commercials that he created for The New Yorker in the 1970's, died on Oct. 8 in Bradenton, Fla. He was 81.</p>
        <p>The cause was heart failure, according to his wife.</p>
        <p>As a senior executive and creative director at two big advertising agencies, Batton, Barton, Durstein &amp; Osborn and later Benton &amp; Bowles, Mr. Hobbs was a frequent speaker at meetings of newspaper and advertising trade groups. He urged ad writers to avoid copycat themes and to stop talking down to consumers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobbs was born in Brookline, Mass., in 1919, attended Phillips Exeter Academy and graduated from Harvard in 1941. He joined BBD&amp; O in 1943 and worked on Madison Avenue until the 1970's, when he became a consultant, chiefly to The New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobbs is survived by his wife of 57 years, Kathrine Hamilton Hobbs; three sons, Peter, of Shelburne Falls, Mass.; Matthew, of Cambridge, Mass.; and Howard, of Hawaii; two sisters, Jean Angle, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Barbara Austin, of New York; a brother, Sturtevant, of South Natick, Mass.; and five grandchildren.</p>
