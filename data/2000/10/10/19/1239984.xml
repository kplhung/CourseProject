        <p>Cries for the ouster of President Joseph Estrada resounded in the halls of power and on the streets here today as opposition legislators filed a resolution to impeach him on charges of taking bribes from gambling rackets.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, about 15,000 demonstrators massed in Manila's financial district to demand Mr. Estrada's resignation. Confetti streamed from the windows of the stock exchange as the ebullient crowd chanted and waved banners that said ''Oust Estrada'' and ''No to corruption and cronyism.''</p>
        <p>For all the clamor, there is a growing recognition here that the drive to remove Mr. Estrada will be long and grueling and may well fail. The Philippine peso and the stock market plunged to fresh lows today as the political establishment appeared to dig in for a protracted siege.</p>
        <p>''I think this will drag on, and the economy will continue to suffer,'' said Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the Philippine vice president, who broke with Mr. Estrada and now heads a coalition of opposition leaders.</p>
        <p>The lawmaker who introduced the impeachment resolution, Heherson T. Alvarez, conceded he did not have enough votes to move it out of the House of Representatives, which is dominated by allies of the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez said he hoped that enough of those legislators would defect from the increasingly discredited Mr. Estrada to pass the resolution. But even in the Senate, which would conduct a trial, a loose alliance of supporters could enable the president to escape conviction and keep his job.</p>
        <p>''He's hoping this will blow over, like the other scandals blew over,'' said Feliciano Belmonte, the House minority leader.</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrada, 63, has denied accepting any kickbacks from gambling rings. Today, he again refused to resign. Speaking to a friendly audience of former squatters who had been helped by a government housing project, he said: ''I will help you all the way. Hopefully, you will do the same for me.''</p>
        <p>The president's troubles began last week when a provincial governor, Luis Singson, accused him of accepting more than $8 million in kickbacks from illegal gambling rings. Mr. Singson portrayed the president as a rapacious man who lives a twilight existence of heavy drinking and marathon mah-jongg games.</p>
        <p>Advisers to Mr. Estrada noted that Mr. Singson, who says he made illegal payoffs to the president, was hardly a reputable witness. They said Mr. Estrada would respond to his claims in the impeachment proceeding.</p>
        <p>Some political analysts said legal machinations would have little bearing on the president's survival. They said Mr. Estrada would lose his grip on power only if the economy suffers so badly as a result of the scandal that the country's poor begin to feel the pinch.</p>
        <p>''The most immediate impact is the downward pressure on the peso,'' said Walden F. Bello, an economist at the University of the Philippines. ''This hurts us because we are so dependent on imports.''</p>
        <p>Aware that their country is competing with Indonesia for the title of sick man of Asia, opposition leaders are uniting behind Vice President Arroyo, who would succeed Mr. Estrada if he steps down or is removed from office. They said they planned to develop policies that could be swiftly carried out by a new government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrada was elected to a six-year term that expires in 2004; he cannot run again.</p>
