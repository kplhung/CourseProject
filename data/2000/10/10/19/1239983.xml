        <p>A bacterium that last flourished before dinosaurs tore flesh or the Appalachian Mountains emerged  has been revived from a drop of fluid trapped in a crystal of rock salt for 250 million years, say biologists at West Chester University in Pennsylvania. But their result was immediately challenged by another biologist.</p>
        <p>The crystal was excavated from 1,850 feet below the earth's surface, from the air duct supplying a radioactive waste dump deep underground near Carlsbad, N.M., in the thick salt beds left by a vanished Permian-age ocean.</p>
        <p>The authors of the new report are Dr. Russell H. Vreeland and Dr. William D. Rosenzweig, together with Dr. Dennis W. Powers, a consulting geologist from Anthony, Tex. In an article in today's issue of Nature, they say they sterilized the surface of the salt crystal, one of 53 they examined, and drilled into a tiny pocket of fluid trapped within it.  When the fluid was mixed with nutrients, a lawn of bacteria appeared.</p>
        <p>Because the crystal was intact, and comes from a salt bed known to have been formed 250 million years ago, the authors say they believe a bacterium was ''trapped inside a crystal at that time and survived within the crystal until the present.''</p>
        <p>Though other biologists claim to have isolated living bacteria from  ancient salt beds in Europe, some experts do not believe that DNA, the genetic material, can survive for more than a few thousand years at best, let alone millions.</p>
        <p>''I just find it a silly and unbelievable report,'' said Dr. Tomas Lindahl, an expert on the stability of DNA who works at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bill Grant, a microbiologist at the University of Leicester in England, said he found the new result plausible because he and others had made living bacteria grow from salt beds as ancient as the one in New Mexico. Though critics would always explain such results as contamination of the sample by present day bacteria, the rigorous sterilization procedures followed by the West Chester biologists was ''nudging closer and closer to the situation where you say it can't really be contamination,'' Dr. Grant said.</p>
        <p>DNA in living cells is under constant attack from chemicals and radiation. Every cell in the human body loses 5,000 letters a day from the sequence that makes up the genetic code, but the damage is repaired by a suite of repair enzymes. After a cell dies, the DNA is usually degraded although fragments of meaningful sequence can survive in special conditions. Short DNA sequences about 40,000 years old have been recovered from the bones of Neanderthals.</p>
        <p>Bacteria can form spores, a tough, hunkered down form in which most metabolism stops. Dr. Lindahl said that spores could survive a few hundred years, maybe even a few thousands, but not for longer. There are no active repair enzymes in a spore, he said, and radioactivity alone would eventually break the DNA into pieces that would make a spore no longer viable.</p>
        <p>For even a spore to survive 250 million years is ''just incredible,'' Dr. Lindahl said.</p>
        <p>The West Chester biologists found that one gene of the bacteria that grew from their crystal was 99 percent similar to that of Bacillus marismortui, a present day bacterium isolated from near the Dead Sea.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lindahl said the sequence similarity was evidence of contamination because through evolution and random change a bacteria that lived 250 million years ago would have a very different DNA sequence from that of present day bacteria.</p>
        <p>Despite the sterilization procedures undertaken by the West Chester biologists, a present day bacteria might have survived in some invisible crack in the crystal, Dr. Lindahl suggested.</p>
        <p>''I am sorry to see that Nature still publishes papers in this vein,'' he said, referring to previous reports of ancient DNA that have been discredited.</p>
        <p>Dr. Henry Gee, a Nature editor,  said that the experts he consulted  were ''absolutely satisfied that this is a bacterium cultured from spores deposited in a salt deposit some 250 million years ago.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosenzweig said he believed that the bacterium from the crystal survived as a spore. He said that it differed in three aspects of its metabolism from Bacillus marismortui and that the similarity of one gene did not mean that all were similar. In any event, the DNA sequence of the gene in question might be almost identical to that of Bacillus marismortui because that bacterium, too, he suggested, might have been trapped in salt for millions of years and only recently released into the environment.</p>
        <p>He was unable to look for any spore or bacterium in the fluid trapped in the crystal because to have placed the fluid under the microscope would have exposed it to contamination, Dr. Rosenzweig said.</p>
        <p>In response to Dr. Lindahl's criticism, Dr. Rosenzweig said there were no apparent cracks in the crystal. ''All I can say is that our sterility checks indicate there was no contamination here,'' he said.</p>
