      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In his final report about the firing of seven longtime employees of the White House travel office released today, Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel, asserted that Hillary Rodham Clinton had given ''factually false'' sworn testimony when she minimized her role in the incident.</p>
        <p>The disclosure of the 243-page report added several details about Mrs. Clinton's role, but its terse conclusions were announced last June when Mr. Ray said there was insufficient evidence to seek criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Mr. Ray disclosed parts of Mrs. Clinton's 1995 deposition he now says are demonstrably false. The report also discloses some of the grand jury testimony of others who spoke to Mrs. Clinton about the travel office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray said, as he had in June, that Mrs. Clinton had played a far greater role in the dismissals than she had admitted. The report cited  evidence that she had repeatedly expressed concerns about the travel office to White House officials who eventually fired the employees as a result of what they had perceived to be pressure from her to do so.</p>
        <p>But in her first detailed rebuttal to Mr. Ray, Mrs. Clinton insisted through her lawyer that she had always testified accurately and fully about her role in the deliberations that led to the dismissal of the seven travel office employees in May 1993. The workers were replaced with people the Clintons knew.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's rebuttal was made in an appendix to the report released today and was signed by her lawyer, David E. Kendall. In essence, Mrs. Clinton said she had expressed legitimate concerns about how the office was run and had not intended for her comments to be taken as the equivalent of orders to fire the travel office employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray's final report about Mrs. Clinton's behavior in the travel office controversy was made public less than three weeks before Election Day. She is running for the Senate from New York.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Syracuse today, Mrs. Clinton told reporters that she would not respond -- beyond the statement by Mr. Kendall -- to the report's assertion that her testimony had been inaccurate.</p>
        <p>But she added that when Mr. Ray first announced his conclusions in June, ''I said I was glad that it was over after all these years, millions of dollars, and I really have nothing further to add to that.''</p>
        <p>Her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, said today that he had not read the report, but he said: ''We believe that character counts in public service. Because we believe that integrity needs to be restored to our public servants.''</p>
        <p>The timing of the report's release is the result of decisions made by Mr. Ray and a panel of three federal judges that supervises his office. Mr. Ray filed the report three months ago and the law provided that the panel could release it after 90 days in which those named in it could review it and provide comments.</p>
        <p>In the newly disclosed testimony by Mrs. Clinton in July 1995, she appeared to flatly deny that she had any role in the dismissals. The report also contains some of the grand jury testimony of David Watkins, the White House aide with whom Mrs. Clinton spoke by telephone about making changes in the office. Mr. Watkins was the official who actually dismissed the employees.</p>
        <p>In his grand jury testimony on Feb. 8, 1995, Mr. Watkins expanded on observations he made in a 1993 memorandum that he wrote to Thomas F. McLarty III, the former White House chief of staff, in what he called an effort to cleanse his soul.</p>
        <p>In the memorandum, Mr. Watkins wrote that ''there would be hell to pay'' if ''we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the first lady's wishes.'' He also wrote that Mrs. Clinton had told him, ''We need our people in there.''</p>
        <p>In his grand jury testimony, Mr. Watkins said Mrs. Clinton told him ''there are too many leftovers that can create and cause us problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's lawyer, said in his statement that Mr. Ray's conclusions were inconsistent because he acknowledged that there was no evidence Mrs. Clinton knew her interest in the travel office ''might impel others to take action.''</p>
        <p>In addition to challenging the report's conclusions, the Kendall statement harshly criticized Mr. Ray and the office of independent counsel, saying the report was highly unfair, misleading and rife with innuendo. Mr. Kendall said in the statement that the report was a political document that buried evidence demonstrating Mrs. Clinton's innocence.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the day, these investigations have largely been a wasteful partisan extravagance,'' Mr. Kendall wrote. Moreover, he said, the final report included significant evidence that Mrs. Clinton was justified in raising concerns about financial improprieties in the office.</p>
        <p>The report is one of three that Mr. Ray has completed since taking over the office from Kenneth W. Starr a year ago today. He has also concluded that there was no need for criminal prosecution in the White House's improper acquisition of hundreds of F.B.I. personnel files or in the investigation of the Whitewater real estate transaction in Arkansas.</p>
        <p>It is unclear if the latest findings about Mrs. Clinton will have any effect on her Senate race.</p>
        <p>White House officials have said repeatedly that voters long ago factored in the investigations involving Mrs. Clinton during the Clinton presidency. In addition, her rebuttal today was only the latest in a years-long effort by Mrs. Clinton and her supporters to portray the independent counsel's investigations as partisan.</p>
        <p>The underlying issue in the dispute between the independent counsel and Mrs. Clinton is Mr. Ray's assertion that she had a role in the firings, despite her insistence in sworn statements that she did not. Mr. Ray cited eight conversations she had with senior White House employees expressing serious concerns about retaining the travel office staff.</p>
        <p>The report said: ''It is, in the independent counsel's judgment beyond peradventure that as a matter of historical fact, Mrs. Clinton's input into the process was a significant -- if not the significant -- factor influencing the pace of events in the travel office firings and the ultimate decision to fire the employees. Accordingly, the independent counsel concludes that Mr. Clinton's sworn testimony that she had no input into Watkins's decision or role in the travel office firings is factually inaccurate.''</p>
        <p>In the rebuttal, Mr. Kendall argued on Mrs. Clinton's behalf that Mr. Ray has misinterpreted her statements and that the sides disagreed over the meaning of the word ''role'' when she was questioned.</p>
        <p>Reminiscent of other controversies in the Clinton administration over language, Mrs. Clinton's lawyers argued that the issue ''boils down to a semantic quibble.'' Mr. Kendall argued that Mrs. Clinton said she had no ''decision-making role'' in the firing -- not that she had not played any role whatsoever. The firing, he said, was solely the decision of Mr. Watkins.</p>
        <p>But the issue of the language is complicated. In her 1995 deposition, Mrs. Clinton was asked if she had ''any role'' in the firings and she replied, ''No, I did not.''</p>
        <p>She was then asked by a prosecutor if she had ''any input with either Mr. McLarty or Mr. Watkins as to that decision.'' She replied, ''I don't believe I did, no.''</p>
        <p>Even more broadly, the controversy in the final report involves the precise nature of Mrs. Clinton's role in the White House and whether her expressions of concern were just that, or the virtual equivalent of orders to subordinates.</p>
        <p>President Clinton issued a statement at the White House in which he said that Mr. Ray's report ''confirms what we have long said: there were financial improprieties in the travel office, the firings were lawful, and the decision to remove the travel office employees was made by White House staff, not the first lady.''</p>
