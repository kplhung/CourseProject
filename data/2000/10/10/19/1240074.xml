        <p>Senate Approves Bill Easing Cuba Sanctions  The Senate approved a bill easing nearly four decades of sanctions on the sale of food to Cuba, all but assuring the measure would become law. While the vote was viewed as a victory for farming groups, the legislation was not expected to lead to large sales of food products to Cuba any time soon.</p>

        <p>Curbing Mideast Violence  Israeli and Palestinian leaders took their first promised steps to avert further violence. Israel pulled back some troops and reopened border posts, and Palestinian leaders publicly urged an end to the street battles that have left more than a hundred Palestinians dead. But skirmishes continued.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The Palestinians carried their bitter confrontation with Israel into a special session of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>

        <p>Inquiry Into Warship Blast  Yemeni police and American investigators centered their inquiry into the bombing of the destroyer Cole on two safe houses and a car with an empty boat trailer found abandoned near the harbor where the destroyer was attacked a week ago.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>President Clinton paid tribute to the crew of the destroyer Cole at a memorial service at a Virginia Naval base, vowing that those who bombed the ship in the Yemeni port at Aden would not escape justice.</p>
        <p>A6</p>
        <p>Illegal Immigrants Found Dead  The bodies of six illegal immigrants believed to be Kurds were found on the side of a highway in Southern Italy, the police said. Italy is a major port of entry to Europe for would-be immigrants from Albania, Turkey, Iraq and Africa.</p>

        <p>Britain Slows Fast Trains  Britain ordered its high-speed trains to slow down on some sections of the nation's railroads, a day after a train traveling 115 miles an hour derailed near London, killing four.</p>
        <p>A20</p>
        <p>Push to Oust Filipino Leader  Philippine opposition legislators filed a resolution to impeach President Joseph Estrada for taking bribes from gambling rackets, and about 15,000 demonstrators massed in Manila's financial district to demand his resignation.</p>

        <p>Testimony in Salvadorans' Trial  Jose Guillermo Garcia, the former Defense Minister of El Salvador, testified in a Florida federal court almost 20 years after Salvadoran soldiers raped and shot four American churchwomen to death. Mr. Garcia, said that while men in his forces ''could have'' had committed abuses, such crimes were in no way emblematic of the military as a whole.</p>

        <p>A22-31</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton Faulted In Travel Office Report  In his final report about the firing of employees of the White House travel office, Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel, asserted that Hillary Rodham Clinton had given ''factually false'' sworn testimony when she minimized her role in the incident. While new details were released, the conclusions had already been announced in June when Mr. Ray said there was insufficient evidence to seek criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Bush Rallies His Base  Gov. George W. Bush argued that Vice President Al Gore would endanger the nation's prosperity as a proponent of ''big government,'' and he used his own pledge of tax cutting to rally his party's base in Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>A30</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers said they wanted to buy 90 minutes of time on cable television channels in swing states to rebroadcast Tuesday's debate. Mr. Gore's performance, the advisers say, helped him make the case for himself as the candidate best prepared to guide the nation's economy.</p>
        <p>A30</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said he and Mr. Gore would be good stewards of nature, while Mr. Bush would spoil it.</p>
        <p>A30</p>
        <p>Premiums and Benefits to Rise  Medicare premiums will rise nearly 10 percent next year, to $50 a month, and Social Security checks will grow by 3.5 percent, to cover increases in the cost of living. The cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security will be the largest since 1992.</p>
        <p>A27</p>
        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Colleges Rush Crime Reports  American colleges are rushing to release statistics on campus crime by a federal deadline next Tuesday. Government officials say they will post on the Internet all university crime records and ultimately fine institutions $25,000 for each unreported crime.</p>
        <p>A22</p>
        <p>Union Rates For-Profit Schools  A teachers union analysis of standardized test scores at schools managed by Edison Schools, the country's largest for-profit manager of public schools, finds that Edison students perform no better than students in comparable, traditional public schools.</p>

        <p>Prosecutors Cite Lapses In Disciplining of the Police  Federal prosecutors investigating how the Police Department handles brutality cases have briefed police union officials on findings that they contend show how serious lapses in department procedures allowed brutal officers to go unpunished, according to several union officials.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Terror Suspect Wanted to Die  A man charged with taking part in a global terrorism conspiracy pleaded to be shot during an interrogation in Germany before he was brought to the United States for trial, a German police official said in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The suspect, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, was arrested after the bombings of the American embassies in East Africa in 1998.</p>

        <p>Nassau County Tax Debate  Nassau County's Republican lawmakers said a property tax increase was necessary to help bring the county's troubled finances into balance next year. But their proposal for a 5 percent rise fell well short of the 16.3 percent being sought by Democratic legislators.</p>

        <p>SCIENCE/HEALTH</p>
        <p>Prehistoric Spore Revived  A bacterium that last flourished before the dinosaurs has been revived from fluid trapped in a crystal of rock salt for 250 million years, say a team of biologists. But their result was immediately challenged by another biologist.</p>
        <p>A25</p>
        <p>Children and Fat  Public health officials are worried that American children in all income groups are getting fatter. One program tries to make families aware of where calories lurk.</p>

        <p>Dow Jones Dips Below 10,000  Stock prices fell further as recovery from a steep plunge early in the session was not enough to keep the Dow Jones industrial average from finishing below the 10,000 mark for the first time since March. Other major averages also lost ground.</p>
