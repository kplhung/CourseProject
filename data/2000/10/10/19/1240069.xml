        <p>My fifth-grade class at Viola Elementary School in Suffern, N.Y., was one of those featured in ''A Day in the Life of a Wired School'' on Oct. 5. Since one letter on Oct. 12 cautioned against having children cut and paste information from the Internet for reports, as was mentioned in the article, I would like to clarify that issue.</p>

        <p>My students were forbidden to copy and paste information from the sites into their reports, but some chose to cut and paste the information as an initial step before they worked with that information to assimilate it and summarize it in their own words.</p>
