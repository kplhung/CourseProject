        <p>Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Senate from New Jersey, yesterday released a new 30-second commercial, titled ''Crucial,'' in his campaign against Representative Bob Franks. Meanwhile, Mr. Franks, a Republican, yesterday began running his first commercial in the New York City media market, a 15-second ad titled ''Impossibly Expensive.'' Following are summaries of each and an analysis of both.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''Crucial''  PRODUCER -- Shrum, Devine &amp; Donilon  ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Corzine consistently uses the same slowed-down, washed-out videotape of Mr. Franks when attacking him. Here, that clip is also blurrier than ever and shrunk to a fraction of the screen. Beneath this picture and Mr. Franks's name, subtitles flash on-screen, each of them accompanied by an ominous sound effect reminiscent of a jail-cell door slamming shut: ''Missed 29 straight votes,'' ''Missed vote to crack down on hate crimes.'' The ad ends with the motto, ''He's being paid by the taxpayers . . . but he's not showing up for work.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''Congressman Bob Franks. He just missed 29 straight votes in Congress. He missed a crucial vote to toughen the drunk driving laws. Missed another one to crack down on hate crimes. He missed a vote to protect a million acres of environmentally sensitive land. He even missed a vote on safety standards to prevent gas pipeline explosions like the one in Edison a few years ago.</p>
        <p>''Bob Franks. He's being paid by the taxpayers -- but he's not showing up for work.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Franks was indeed absent for 29 straight votes between Sept. 28 and Oct. 12. But few, if any, were crucial. Rather, many of the matters at stake were routine, and nearly all the votes overwhelmingly carried. Mr. Franks says he would have voted with the majority almost every time. One exception, Mr. Franks says, is the vote cited by Mr. Corzine on pipeline safety standards. Mr. Franks said he opposed the new standards, as did most Democrats who voted, because they were weaker than initially proposed. Mr. Franks said he would have voted for the hate-crimes law as well as the tougher drunken-driving law, which was part of a transportation funding bill, but that he was given assurances that both bills would pass regardless; they did. Finally, the ad suggests that the vote to protect a million acres of sensitive land was one of the 29 votes Mr. Franks missed recently. In fact, it occurred on June 7, the day after the Senate primary; the land was in Utah, and the missed votes were actually on three amendments to a bill that was later tabled and has yet to be acted upon, Mr. Franks said. Mr. Franks also said that his voting record was 98 or 99 percent in each of his first seven years; this year he has slipped to 74 percent, but 20 of the 138 votes he missed were because of the death of his father.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Corzine demonstrates considerable chutzpah for attacking Mr. Franks for missing votes, given that he himself has a spotty voting record as a New Jersey citizen. The Corzine campaign, of course, notes that as a congressman, Mr. Franks is paid to vote, while Mr. Corzine, as a resident of Summit, is not.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''Impossibly Expensive''  PRODUCER -- Smith &amp; Harroff  ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with an unflattering close-up of Mr. Corzine in mid-utterance. Alongside, excerpts from newspaper editorials flash on screen: ''big-spending political novice,'' ''impossibly expensive.'' The ad then borrows a clip from one of Mr. Corzine's campaign commercials, in which he whoops as he awkwardly high-fives someone during a game of pool. Next, the ad jump-cuts, staccato style, through several frames of Mr. Corzine's TV attacks on Mr. Franks, before settling again on the original picture of Mr. Corzine, this time alongside the block-lettered slogan, ''N.J. ain't buying it.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''Jon Corzine. A 'big-spending political novice,' says The New York Times. With 'impossibly expensive' proposals, says The Star-Ledger. What's big Jon say? Millions more for negative ads distorting Congressman Franks's record.</p>
        <p>''Sorry, Jon. New Jersey ain't buying it.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Franks accurately cites newspaper editorials that criticized Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Franks finally gets into the paid-television game in the densely populated northern half of New Jersey, but with a minuscule budget: he is spending only $150,000 so far in the New York media market. He promises more. That said, his ad is terse and funny, mocking Mr. Corzine as ''big Jon'' while suggesting his ungainly high-five and irrepressible whoop are his only response to nagging criticisms.</p>
