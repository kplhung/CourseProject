        <p>Yemeni and American teams investigating the bombing of the destroyer Cole centered their inquiry today on two safe houses and a car found abandoned across the harbor from where the ship was attacked last Thursday, killing 17 sailors.</p>
        <p>Al Ayyam, Aden's main newspaper, said today that bomb-making equipment had been found in at least one of the houses, which had been rented, and that traces of explosives had been found in the car.</p>
        <p>A senior Yemeni police officer confirmed that investigators had questioned the landlord of a house and a real estate agent involved in renting it to a man shortly before the attack. The man has since disappeared.</p>
        <p>Other Yemeni sources, including Al Ayyam, said that two men had used the houses. The two had raised walls around one house but had still been seen doing welding work.</p>
        <p>In a television interview broadcast throughout the Middle East tonight, the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, said investigators had found ''the house that the people who carried out the crime were living in,'' as well as a workshop where the engine of the boat used in the attack had been assembled.</p>
        <p>He said a 12-year-old Aden boy had provided a crucial lead. President Saleh said the boy had described a bearded man with glasses who gave him small change and told him to watch a car near Aden harbor on the day of the bombing.</p>
        <p>The president said that according to the boy, the man then took to the sea in a rubber boat he had transported to the harbor on the roof of the car, and did not return. Mr. Saleh said that the boy's story had led the police to an apartment in Aden, the scene of further discoveries.</p>
        <p>The reference to a rubber boat supported descriptions of the boat involved in the attack as a small and inflatable, with an outboard motor. United States Navy officials, citing debris aboard the Cole, have suggested that the boat could have had a fiberglass hull.</p>
        <p>The car, and a boat trailer near it, were found across from the city and ports of Aden, at the north end of a peninsula known as Little Aden, a place with a sweeping harbor view. Last Thursday it would have been a short journey from there across the water to the Cole.</p>
        <p>Witnesses said that a small boat carrying two men approached the destroyer from its port side, weaving among other boats involved in refueling and servicing the destroyer. The small boat then detonated against the side of the Cole. Mr. Saleh said investigators had determined that the two men were killed in the blast.</p>
        <p>From the sketchy accounts of the investigation's early efforts, it was not clear whether the Yemenis or the American team, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had conclusively linked the houses, the car and the trailer to the attack on the Cole. American officials leading the inquiry and overseeing recovery efforts have refused to discuss their progress, to avoid compromising chances of tracking down those ultimately responsible.</p>
        <p>American officials said that Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. director, was scheduled to arrive in Yemen on Thursday to oversee the inquiry.</p>
        <p>The recovery over the past 24 hours of 8 more bodies left 4 of the 17 dead sailors still unaccounted for. Navy officials said divers and metal-cutting specialists were still working aboard the destroyer.</p>
        <p>The Navy has described the search for the bodies as dangerous. It involves working in a heavily blasted area of tangled metal, much of it underwater, not far from where large amounts of unexploded ordinance, including cruise missiles, were stored when the attack occurred. Some of the Navy divers involved worked in the salvage operations off Long Island after the crash of of T.W.A. Flight 800 in July 1996.</p>
        <p>As eight metal coffins were loaded aboard a United States military plane for the journey home, it was clear there had been a major breakthrough in the case. But it was less certain whether any of the evidence had given investigators a better idea which group carried out the attack, or what the motives were.</p>
        <p>By midafternoon the chief of Saudi Arabia's intelligence services, Prince Turki bin al-Faisal, arrived in Aden, apparently to help with the investigation.</p>
        <p>Prince Turki, who remained in Aden overnight, has more than two decades of experience monitoring leftist and Islamic radical groups.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, the prince led Saudi Arabia's effort to finance and train Muslim guerrillas fighting Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan, and it was these guerrilla groups that later spawned many of the Islamic terrorist organizations operating in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Although the Saudi Embassy in Yemen insisted that the prince's visit was unrelated to the Cole investigation, a Middle East specialist said,  ''Nobody knows the Islamic radical groups operating in Yemen any better than Prince Turki.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, American officials here reiterated that they had no firm leads on the Cole's attackers. Partly because of Yemen's history as a refuge for Islamic and leftist radical groups, theories in Aden have covered a broad spectrum of possibilities. The most common one is that the attack may be linked to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire believed to be hiding in Afghanistan, who has been indicted in the United States in connection with the bombings of two American Embassies in Africa in 1998.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary William S. Cohen plans to announce on Thursday that two senior military leaders will be pulled from retirement to head a Pentagon inquiry, with special emphasis on force protection and any security lapses, Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said.</p>
        <p>The two men are Adm. Harold W. Gehman, Jr., the recently retired commander of the Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., and Gen. William Crouch, who commanded United States troops in Europe at the beginning of the Bosnia peacekeeping operation.</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials also said the Camden, an oiler, arrived in Aden this evening to refuel the six Navy ships already in the harbor with the Cole. The Tarawa arrived on Tuesday, joining the Anchorage and Duluth, which are part of an amphibious group that includes 2,100 Marines sent to Aden to provide protection.</p>
