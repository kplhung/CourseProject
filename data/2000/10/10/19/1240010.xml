        <p>It happened at a dinner at Manhattan's ''21'' Club last week to celebrate almost half a century of Gifford's connection to the National Football League. He was the Giants' top draft pick of 1952.</p>
        <p>The Giants' co-owner, Wellington Mara, ended the dinner with a surprise announcement, holding up Gifford's famed No. 16 and telling him no one else would wear the jersey again. Gifford is the 11th Giant to have his number retired.</p>
