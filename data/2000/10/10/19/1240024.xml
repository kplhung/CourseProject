        <p>Just a year ago, John Q. Adams was holding his aching head and wondering what had gone wrong. The results of a new state math test had just come out, and only 39 percent of the eighth graders at his school in Brooklyn had met state standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams's students had done better than the abysmal citywide average of 23 percent. But in the surrounding middle- and working-class neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge and Sunset Park, where parents are electricians, civil servants, jewelers and doctors, better than average was not good enough.</p>

        <p>Just a year ago, John Q. Adams was holding his aching head and wondering what had gone wrong. The results of a new state math test had just come out, and only 39 percent of the eighth graders at his school in Brooklyn had met state standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams's students had done better than the abysmal citywide average of 23 percent. But in the surrounding middle- and working-class neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge and Sunset Park, where parents are electricians, civil servants, jewelers and doctors, better than average was not good enough.</p>
        <p>''It was devastating,'' Mr. Adams, the principal of Intermediate School 187, recalled this week.</p>
        <p>This year, while the rest of the city stagnated, I.S. 187, in Dyker Heights, bucked the trend, posting the biggest gain of any school in the city. Fifty-seven percent of the students passed the test, a rise of 18 percentage points.</p>
        <p>It was a gain so rare that in today's cynical education environment it was more likely to invite suspicions of cheating than congratulations.</p>
        <p>But in a tour of his school this week, Mr. Adams provided a case study in how high-stakes testing -- often maligned as shallow, misdirected and irrelevant -- can drive improvements in education.</p>
        <p>The trick, Mr. Adams said, was hard work, extra hours, small classes and teachers steeped in their subjects.</p>
        <p>Over the last school year, dozens of the academically neediest students at I.S. 187 got not just more test preparation, but more hard-core education. Every child who scored in the bottom of four levels -- ''far below standards'' -- on state and city math tests was scheduled for double periods of math from September to June. Instead of the customary five periods of math a week, these children got 10, giving up electives like physical education, home economics and assembly.</p>
        <p>Every day, in classes of just 10 to 12 students, they got a second chance to go over material they had struggled with in their regular classes of 33. Even children who passed the test were offered homework help, peer tutoring and test-taking strategy sessions before and after school and during lunch.</p>
        <p>When the state math test was given again in June, 58 more children -- the equivalent of two full classes -- passed it this year than last.</p>
        <p>This week, a new round of letters went home to parents, reflecting the latest round of test scores. Children who scored high enough to avoid double math periods, but still below standards, are once again being urged to attend after-school math and homework programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams acknowledged that having 57 percent meeting standards, though higher than the city average of 23 percent, still left a lot to be desired. So he is once again devoting time and money to children at the bottom.</p>
        <p>The extra classes are paid for with I.S. 187's share of $30 million in ''ending social promotion'' money -- for programs to help promote struggling students legitimately into the next grades. Such funds were allocated to middle schools throughout the city by the Board of Education, for the second year in a row, but each of the city's 32 school districts is allowed to decide how to spend its allotment, which amounts to $121 for every sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade student citywide. Other schools used the money to lower class sizes, start new after-school programs and hire specialized teachers.</p>
        <p>I.S. 187's decision to add math classes benefits children like Brittany Boccio, a diminutive girl with glasses and a riveting gaze, who was scared of math until she started attending double sessions last year. ''Thank heaven for Mrs. Mennella,'' Brittany said this week, praising her remedial math teacher, Grace Ann Mennella, a certified public accountant with a bachelor's degree in probability theory and statistics. ''I can't believe how much I improved.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Ms. Mennella reviewed prime numbers for Brittany and nine classmates. They had been introduced to the same material last Friday, in a regular math class, but their grasp of it was still shaky. Using stick figures, charts and a lively sense of humor, Ms. Mennella drew each child into an exploration of prime numbers. She ended the lesson with a mathematical game, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a grid that showed the pattern of prime numbers.</p>
        <p>Most of these children, Ms. Mennella said later, can do the work. But they have fallen so far behind that they have lost faith in their own ability. And they are embarrassed to ask what might be perceived as stupid questions in front of children who understand the work. She sees her job as restoring their confidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams has instituted a similar regimen for children who were weak in English. The proportion of his eighth graders meeting state standards in English rose by 8 percentage points to 64 percent.</p>
        <p>Asked about curriculum and textbooks -- among the issues that obsess education advocates and teaching colleges -- the teachers at I.S. 187 look bemused. They have not changed textbooks in six years, since I.S. 187, formally known as the Christa McAuliffe School, was founded in a shuttered elementary school at 1171 65th Street, as immigration, the thriving economy and the declining crime rate in the city swelled the ranks of children going to public school in the surrounding neighborhood of modest attached houses.</p>
        <p>Their mathematics curriculum is the boilerplate city and state math curriculum, which has been around, as one teacher said wearily, forever. Curriculums come and go, they said, but the constants when it comes to creating a strong school are hiring qualified teachers, keeping the school open to new ideas, encouraging teachers to work as a team, making sure that children who fall behind are noticed and keeping in touch with parents.</p>
        <p>''We've all been at other schools where we've never seen the camaraderie that we have,'' said Dorothy Multari, a math teacher.</p>
        <p>Barbara Heinberg, another math teacher, interjected, ''We have very cooperative parents.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Multari added, ''And the peer pressure is to do well.''</p>
        <p>While many schools in New York struggle with uncertified teachers who are not trained in the subjects they teach, a majority of math teachers at I.S. 187 received an undergraduate degree, if not a master's, in mathematics, Mr. Adams said.</p>
        <p>I.S. 187 hires its teachers as zealously as a Wall Street investment bank hires its stockbrokers. Most principals pluck their teachers off a list compiled by the Board of Education, in a civil-service system in which seniority counts more than compatibility, talent or skills. At I.S. 187, hiring is done by a committee of teachers, parents, administrators and often a school aide, who interview every candidate.</p>
        <p>Since the Board of Education adopted its so-called new standards for math and English several years ago, it has become common to find schools, especially in poor neighborhoods, decorated with jargon-filled posters extolling one or another of the standards. At some schools, teachers are encouraged to memorize the standards verbatim, right down to the code number, like, ''Standard M4b: Statistics and Probability Concepts: Display data.''</p>
        <p>Not here. High standards, Mr. Adams said, are intuitive. ''I'd rather have student work posted,'' he said. ''I'd rather have them proud of what they do.''</p>
        <p>Parents have responded to the school's approach. It has grown from 250 students in 1994 to 1,059 students this year, divided into three smaller academies, each with its own theme: global communication, scientific research, and arts and humanities. The demographics have also changed, from 40 percent white, 29 percent Hispanic, 27 percent Asian and 4 percent black in 1995-96 to 53 percent white, 13 percent Hispanic, 30 percent Asian and 3 percent black this school year. The shift probably represents the area's more middle-class population, Mr. Adams said, and includes 15 classes of gifted students -- admitted by virtue of standardized test scores -- and 20 regular classes.</p>
        <p>As the population has shifted, test scores have risen steadily -- but never as greatly as this year. Though he respects the tests, Mr. Adams tries not to get carried away by them.</p>
        <p>''It's like the price of my house,'' Mr. Adams, who was born and raised in Brooklyn and still lives there, said ruefully. ''It can't keep going up forever. You can brag and puff out your chest about test scores, but that's not the true essence of our school.''</p>
