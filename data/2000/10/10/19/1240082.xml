        <p>A man charged with participating in a global terrorism conspiracy pleaded to be shot during a lengthy interrogation in Germany before he was brought to the United States for trial, a German police official testified yesterday.</p>
        <p>The official said that the suspect, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who was arrested in Munich after the bombings of the United States embassies in East Africa in 1998, started to bang his head against the wall and said: ''You have a pistol.

        <p>A man charged with participating in a global terrorism conspiracy pleaded to be shot during a lengthy interrogation in Germany before he was brought to the United States for trial, a German police official testified yesterday.</p>
        <p>The official said that the suspect, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who was arrested in Munich after the bombings of the United States embassies in East Africa in 1998, started to bang his head against the wall and said: ''You have a pistol. Why don't you use this pistol on me, and then the whole thing will be finished.''</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say Mr. Salim, who is from Sudan, was a senior deputy to the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, and that he tried to obtain materials on Mr. bin Laden's behalf that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Mr. Salim was placed on a suicide watch in a Munich jail cell, the German official, Rupert Folger, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Folger's testimony came during a somewhat contentious pretrial hearing in which Mr. Salim's lawyers asked Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan to suppress a lengthy statement Mr. Salim gave after his arrest.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Folger's account, Mr. Salim talked almost nonstop to investigators from Sept. 16 until Sept. 28, 1998.</p>
        <p>''He said to me: 'I'm going to tell you everything you want to know. I'm going to prove my innocence,' '' said Mr. Folger, a police inspector in Munich.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salim did not testify yesterday but appeared highly agitated, interrupting the proceedings several times and asking to be heard.</p>
        <p>When the judge refused his request, Mr. Salim placed cotton balls in each of his ears, and buried his face in his arms.</p>
        <p>The issue of whether his statement should be ruled admissible in an American court comes at a time when terrorism investigators for the United States government have become increasingly reliant on police agencies in other countries, as in the embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, which killed more than 200 people, and more recently, in the bombing of the American destroyer Cole in Yemen, which killed 17 sailors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salim and his lawyers have challenged whether Mr. Salim's statement was voluntary, and thus admissible at his trial, saying he was deprived of food, medication and sleep by German and American interrogators and that his requests for a lawyer were refused.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Folger denied any mistreatment of Mr. Salim. He said Mr. Salim was repeatedly advised of his German rights, and that he was also advised of his American rights, including his right to counsel and to call his embassy, by the American interrogators, who included agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a prosecutor.</p>
        <p>''It was Mr. Salim who wanted to -- insisted on continuing with this interrogation,'' Mr. Folger testified. ''He wanted to prove that the accusations were not valid.''</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Salim was given pizza and soft drinks, allowed to phone his family and to pray, and that when he said he was too tired, the questioning was cut off for the night.</p>
        <p>''Had Mr. Salim made any complaints to you about his treatment?'' asked a federal prosecutor, Michael J. Garcia.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Mr. Folger said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salim's outbursts began as the hearing started. Seated in leg irons and surrounded by federal marshals, he raised his hand, and declared that he wanted to speak, but Judge Sand denied the request. He seemed upset at his lawyers, and that the hearing was taking place despite his sending a letter to the court trying to withdraw the motion to suppress the statement.</p>
        <p>''I already withdraw this motion, so you're wasting your time,'' Mr. Salim told Judge Sand. ''They are wasting the money of the government.''</p>
        <p>At one point, the judge said, ''You have a mistaken understanding of what it is within your power to do and what it is within the court's power to do.''</p>
        <p>After more exchanges, Judge Sand declared that he would not delay the hearing or trial any further.</p>
        <p>''This matter is going to proceed,'' the judge said sternly.</p>
        <p>Later, when the judge denied a request that Mr. Salim be able to cross-examine Mr. Folger himself, he protested again, drawing repeated admonitions from the judge.</p>
        <p>''Sir, I've asked you now several times to be quiet,'' he said. ''Now please obey that instruction.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, Judge Sand held a closed hearing, attended only by Mr. Salim and his lawyers, to address the defendant's concerns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salim's defense lawyers said they had no comment after the hearing. One lawyer, Charles D. Adler, said, ''The court has imposed very strict rules regarding our discussions with the press and I will adhere to them.''</p>
