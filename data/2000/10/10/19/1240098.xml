        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>ITALY: VOTING ABROAD -- A constitutional amendment was approved to allow Italians overseas to elect their own legislators, including candidates who live abroad. Twelve seats in the 630-seat lower house and six in the 315-seat Senate are to be allocated to representatives of Italians abroad, of whom there are about 4 million, with more than 300,000 in the United States and Canada. First, however, a law must be passed setting up candidates' procedural rules. Voting by absentee ballot is not allowed.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: CABINET RESIGNATION -- Martine Aubry, the cabinet minister who shepherded the introduction of the government's 35-hour workweek policy, has quit her cabinet post to run for mayor of Lille. The widely expected move is seen as a steppingstone to run for higher office in 2002. If Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who is expected to run for president in 2002, were to win, Mrs. Aubry could well replace him as prime minister. Mr. Jospin named his justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, to take over Mrs. Aubry's portfolio.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: AMERICAN'S TRIAL DELAYED -- A Moscow court granted a one-day delay in the espionage trial of Edmond Pope, the American businessman accused of trying to buy secret plans for a torpedo, so lawyers could draft specifications for an evaluation of Mr. Pope's bone cancer. Lawyers argue that Mr. Pope, in jail since April, has been denied proper medical care. Judges denied other requests in the closed-door trial, including a plea for a jury.</p>
        <p>Michael Wines (NYT)</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: TORTURE REPORT -- Amnesty International said torture is increasing around the world, in dictatorships and democracies. At a news conference, Pierre Sane, secretary general of the London-based rights group, said it had uncovered evidence of beatings, rape, electric shock and other forms of torture in more than 150 countries, including Britain and the United States. Between 1997 and 2000 there was evidence of widespread torture by state agents in more than 70 countries, the group said.</p>

        <p>AUSTRIA: TALKS ON NUCLEAR PLANT -- Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel and Prime Minister Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic plan to meet on Oct. 31 in the Czech city of Brno to try to resolve a dispute over a nuclear plant in Temelin, some 35 miles from the Austrian border. The Czech foreign minister, Jan Kavan, said the meeting would take place only if a suspended blockade of the border by antinuclear protesters was officially called off.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: PRESIDENT TO QUIT -- President Adolf Ogi said he would resign this year, leading to speculation of a change in the traditional coalition-style government. Mr. Ogi was at odds with the rightward turn of his Swiss People's Party, which did well in last year's elections on an anti-refugee platform. The anti-Europe views of a leading party figure, Christoph Blocher, differed from Mr. Ogi's. With Mr. Ogi gone, Mr. Blocher may again try to win a seat on the country's governing council.</p>

        <p>EGYPT: VOTING BEGINS -- Elections for the 444-seat People's Assembly got under way, with scattered reports of harassment or arrests of people supporting independent candidates. The governing National Democratic Party was expected to maintain its overwhelming majority in the Parliament, where a handful of small opposition parties together control only 6 percent of the seats. Voting will also take place on Oct. 29 and Nov. 8.</p>

        <p>IRAN: KHATAMI HITS OUT -- President Mohammad Khatami denounced the ''sick'' campaign against his reform movement and warned of an explosion of popular anger if his rivals continue to ignore the will of the people, the state news agency said. In an emotional defense before an audience of students, Mr. Khatami made a rare direct attack on conservatives who have hobbled his efforts to liberalize Iran's social and political life.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: RIOTS SPREAD -- Soldiers joined the police in patrolling the streets of Lagos after riots that have already led to more than 100 deaths spread throughout the commercial capital. The security forces fired shots in the air to disperse rioters, many of whom appeared to be unemployed youths known as area boys. The violence began with clashes between a Yoruba group and Hausa merchants.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: PROTESTS IN THIRD DAY -- Protesters angered by soaring food prices clashed with the police in the townships near Harare for a third day. Police officers and soldiers patrolled several townships, searched houses and sprayed tear gas when protesters tried to block roads. With the economy unraveling, inflation is soaring, and the price of bread and sugar surged by 30 percent this month.</p>

        <p>CANADA: BACKTRACKING ON MOUNTAIN -- Bowing to western pressure, the government is backtracking on a decision to rename the nation's highest peak, Mount Logan, after Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the former prime minister who died on Sept. 28. With sympathy for Mr. Trudeau low in the west, Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who is expected to call an election for Nov. 27, has indicated that he now supports a Yukon Territory proposal to name a sub-peak of Mount Logan after the French Canadian.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: TABASCO VOTE IN DOUBT -- With two rivals claiming victory, and the leadership of Mexico's long-governing political party in the balance, results of Sunday's election for governor in the state of Tabasco will not be known before the weekend, election overseers said. Preliminary results gave a 1 percent lead to Manuel Andrade, the hand-picked successor to Gov. Roberto Madrazo, who wants to be the next national leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. His opponent, Raul Ojeda, of the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution, says the lead was built by fraud.</p>

        <p>CHILE: TRUCK STRIKE CONTINUES -- Striking truckers obstructed roads throughout the country for a second day, and concern grew over possible food and fuel shortages. Leaders of the National Confederation of Truck Owners, who transport 92 percent of the freight hauled in Chile, said more than 7,500 vehicles were involved in the protest against a tax on diesel fuel. The government put the figure at 2,000 vehicles.</p>

        <p>CHINA: FALUN GONG DEATHS -- Three more followers of the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual movement have died in police custody, bringing the known total to 57 since the group was banned last year, according the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy, based in Hong Kong. A 61-year-old man in Shandong Province died last week after he was arrested for distributing Falun Gong literature, the group said. Another follower jumped from a train and died while being repatriated to Shandong, while a third follower died after he fell from a building during police questioning.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: PRESIDENT'S BROTHER IS SPEAKER -- President Chandrika Kumaratunga's estranged brother, Anura Bandaranaike, was elected speaker of Parliament. The sister and brother come from the country's leading political dynasty. Both their parents served as prime minister. Mrs. Kumaratunga heads the ruling coalition, which has just returned to power. Her brother is a leader of the opposition United National Party.</p>
