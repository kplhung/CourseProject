        <p>THE materials are the message here: leather, rich woods, rattan and wicker make these sleek dining chairs too appealing to hide under the table. Many are comfortable enough for reading or lounging between meals. And none of the basketwork chairs felt prickly, so hold the cushions.</p>
        <p>1. Relax, an Italian chair by Studio Datta e Mosca, front, has a steel frame covered in leather. It comes in 16 colors and costs $917 (with arms, $1,033) at DDC, 181 Madison Avenue (34th Street).</p>
