        <p>Q.  Is there another way I can move a large number of WordPerfect files from my old PC laptop to my new iMac (which does not have a floppy-disk drive) besides sending them via e-mail one at a time?</p>
        <p>A.  You can compress multiple files into one attachment with utility software like WinZip or PKZIP before sending them to yourself. You can download a free copy of Expander for Macintosh from the link on the Aladdin Systems site, at www .aladdinsys.com, to open the ZIP file attachments on the iMac.</p>

        <p>Q.  Is there another way I can move a large number of WordPerfect files from my old PC laptop to my new iMac (which does not have a floppy-disk drive) besides sending them via e-mail one at a time?</p>
        <p>A.  You can compress multiple files into one attachment with utility software like WinZip or PKZIP before sending them to yourself. You can download a free copy of Expander for Macintosh from the link on the Aladdin Systems site, at www .aladdinsys.com, to open the ZIP file attachments on the iMac.</p>
        <p>Another option is to upload your files from the PC to one of the many free storage sites on the Web, then download them to your iMac. The Aladdin Systems page has a link to its Free Drive service, which gives registered users 20 megabytes of storage space on its servers.Other free-storage sites that will work with PC's and Macs include iDrive (www.idrive.com) and iMacFloppy.com (www.imacfloppy.com).</p>
        <p>Q.  Is there a way to change the letter on an external CD-ROM drive on my Windows 95 system?</p>
        <p>A.  You can change the letter for your CD-ROM drive on a Windows 95 or 98 system in just a few steps. Go to he Start menu, then to Settings and Control Panel. Double-click on the System icon in the Control Panel window. With the System box open, click on the Device Manager tab.</p>
        <p>Click on the small plus sign next to the CD-ROM icon to show all the CD-ROM drives attached to the computer. Click on the particular drive that you want to change, then click on the Properties button. In the Properties box, click on the Settings tab, and in the Reserved Drive Letters section at the bottom, set the Start Letter Drive and End Drive Letter pop-up menus to the letter you would like your CD-ROM drive to have. Once you have chosen, click O.K. on all the open dialog boxes. Once you have cleared the boxes off your screen, restart the computer so the change takes effect.</p>
        <p>Q.  How do I install the extra programs that come with the Windows 98 CD-ROM but aren't already on my computer?</p>
        <p>A.  Programs on the Windows 98 CD-ROM that were not installed on your computer are probably things like utility and accessibility software. They are mainly add-ons or enhancements to standard Windows functions.</p>
        <p>To install the programs, insert your CD into the CD-ROM drive. Double-click on the CD icon in My Computer. Click on the Add/Remove Programs icon, then select the Windows Setup tab in the box. (You can also get to the Add/Remove icon by going to the Start menu, to Settings and then Control Panel and clicking on the Add/Remove icon. Click on the Windows Set-up tab. You may be prompted to insert the Windows 98 CD-ROM later.)</p>
        <p>You should see the programs to install presented in 12 categories, including Accessibility, Communications, Desktop Themes and Internet Tools. If you happen to work with documents created in non-Western languages, you can also install Multilanguage Support files.</p>
        <p>You can click on each component on the list and see a description of what the software does and how much space it will take up on your computer. The box should also tell you how much space you have left on your hard drive so you can make sure that you have room to install the extra software. You can see information about the contents of each category by clicking the Details button.</p>
        <p>Check the boxes next to the names of the files you would like to add to your system. (If you see a check box with a gray background and a check already in it, your computer already has some of the components in that category installed.) Click O.K. to install them.</p>
        <p>You can find even more utilities on the CD-ROM, like the Resource Kit Sampler, by clicking on the Browse This CD option on the CD's main screen. The Resource Kit is in the Tools folder, inside Reskit. Click on the Setup.exe icon to install the files on your computer, and be sure to check out the README file.</p>
