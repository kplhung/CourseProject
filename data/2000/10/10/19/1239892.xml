        <p>At spring break, some college students go to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., drink beer and call it fun. Not the product design students at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan. Last spring, Tony Whitfield, the chairman of the school's product design department, took 15 students to Guyana, where they collaborated with Liana Cane Lab, a local furniture company, to transform designs into reality. The students spent three days in the rain forest, where they saw how cane, a renewable aerial root, grows.</p>
        <p>''Cane has no knots and is very flexible,'' Mr. Whitfield said. ''You can cut this out, and it renews itself.'' In one week, the students designed and made prototypes of cane furniture, including this steel-based cane chair, above, by Hlynur Atlason, a Parsons student. The chair is 28 inches high, and is sized for children 2 to 12 years old. It sells for $580 through Red Wing and Chambers, Mr. Whitfield's studio. For information on the chair and other designs from the students' trip to Guyana: (718) 638-4514.</p>
