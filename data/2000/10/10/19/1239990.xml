        <p>Sun Microsystems announced record quarterly earnings and revenue today, including strong sales in Europe, where other computer makers say they have faltered. But the company's stock ended down for the day, and analysts said a slip in gross profit margins was to blame.</p>
        <p>The earnings news, due after the market closed, came out earlier than planned because of a logistical glitch that set off a frenzy of midday trading. The company inadvertently posted the results on its Web site before noon, causing a flurry of buying that sent Sun shares as high as $119.50 before trading was halted for 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>Sun, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., then officially issued the results, and trading resumed. Its stock closed at $110.31, down $1.06.</p>
        <p>Despite the market reception, industry analysts said the results represented exceptionally strong, continued growth not only in Sun's powerful computer servers but also in its other businesses. And Sun projected that those trends would continue.</p>
        <p>For its fiscal first quarter, which ended on Oct. 1, Sun said earnings -- before acquisition-related charges -- rose 85 percent, to $510 million, or 30 cents a share, from $276 million, or 16 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The earnings came on revenue of $5.05 billion, an increase of 63 percent over $3.15 billion a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive, said that the company was breaking away from the competition and that current demand was so great that the real barriers to growth were whether it could assimilate new customers and employees quickly enough.</p>
        <p>''It's open-field running for us right now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But industry analysts, and evidently some investors, found reason to be wary of the drop in the company's gross margins, which are calculated by subtracting the costs of production from revenue. In the most recent quarter, gross margins were 48.2 percent, down from 51.9 percent in the year-earlier period.</p>
        <p>Michael Lehman, Sun's chief financial officer, attributed the drop to short supply -- and rising costs -- of computer memory. ''We're competing for worldwide capacity,'' he said, adding that the company expected the high demand to continue.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts said that while the company should not welcome any decrease in gross margins, this particular case was not as damaging as some circumstances -- for instance, if Sun were dropping prices for its servers amid a price war.</p>
        <p>Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said Sun's difficulty in obtaining components was understandable because the company faced such strong demand.</p>
        <p>Over all, Mr. Sacconaghi called the quarter ''very, very strong'' and said investor concerns about the gross margins might dissipate in the coming days as the reasons for the decrease come to light.</p>
        <p>The company said revenue grew 60 percent in the United States over the year-earlier quarter, 49 percent in Japan and 57 percent in Europe. Executives noted that the company did not see a widespread drop in demand because of the weak euro, but they did say results had suffered from exchanging the euro back into dollars, a phenomenon that is expected to continue.</p>
        <p>As for the premature release of the earnings today, Mr. Lehman blamed ''human error,'' saying someone at Sun posted the earnings headlines on the Web site.</p>
        <p>The company said the headline, which read in part, ''First Quarter Net Income Grew 85% on Revenue Growth of 60%,'' remained on the site for more than half an hour before the company realized the error.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, investors scrambled to buy the stock, while industry analysts sought to figure out whether the information was accurate.</p>
        <p>Andrew J. Neff, senior managing director at Bear, Stearns, said he called his compliance department to find out if he legally could comment on the news. He said he also called to let Sun know of the problem, and got an executive on the line.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Oh, heck' -- but he didn't use the word 'heck,' -- 'we have to get that off of there,' '' said Mr. Neff, who added that the episode was particularly embarrassing for a company that tries to engender trust in the Web.</p>
        <p>''I've been in this business 18 years,'' he said, ''and I've never seen this happen.''</p>
