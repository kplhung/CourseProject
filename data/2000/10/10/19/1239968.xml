        <p>Russia's aging Mir space station, unoccupied and starved for the money necessary to operate it, may be near the end of its 15-year life, experts said today.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Russian Space Agency are to meet in Moscow early Thursday to recommend that the Russian government either keep Mir in space or bring it down early next year. With little prospect of renewed financing coming in quickly enough, several experts said the agency was highly likely to decide against maintaining the station, signaling that the end of Mir is near.</p>
        <p>The experts said Russia had little choice but to take Mir from orbit soon for safety reasons, because the 130-ton station is slowly sinking toward Earth and could harm people and property if it fell uncontrollably. Keeping Mir in space would require boosting it with spacecraft that the Russians can no longer afford, the experts said.</p>
        <p>''I really don't see Mir lasting too much longer,'' said Charles Vick, an expert on the Russian space program with the Federation of American Scientists. ''The Russians don't have the money to operate it any longer, and I'm not convinced that the private financing is there to do it, either.''</p>
        <p>The Russian government, which owns Mir, stopped supporting the station last year but has leased commercial rights to MirCorp, a company in Amsterdam. MirCorp is trying to raise money to save the station for commercial ventures, and it continues to lobby hard for a reprieve. Executives of the company, which has spent more than $40 million this year on missions to Mir to keep it operating, said the battle was not over.</p>
        <p>''There have been threats of Mir's demise before, and that is nothing new to us,'' Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, an important MirCorp investor and a board member, said today.</p>
        <p>The president, Jeffrey Manber, has been in Moscow for more than a week lobbying officials and others about the wisdom of keeping Mir in space, MirCorp said.</p>
        <p>''The Russian government is slowly beginning to understand that the money will be coming,'' Dr. Kathuria said. ''And we think they will keep Mir up long enough to see that we will come through with it.''</p>
        <p>The United States and other partners in the International Space Station have been urging Russia to stop putting its scarce resources into Mir and concentrate on its commitments to the international project.</p>
        <p>MirCorp, which is owned 60 percent by Russian interests and 40 percent by American investors, sponsored a 73-day mission by two Russian astronauts to revive Mir and two cargo flights to deliver supplies.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the Russians launched an unmanned Progress cargo craft to Mir. It is to rendezvous with Mir on Friday with fuel and supplies. MirCorp promised to pay for the Progress mission, which is intended to boost Mir temporarily to a higher orbit.</p>
        <p>Some Russian officials were upset that the money was not immediately available.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kathuria said MirCorp would reimburse the government for the Progress flight, but said the $10 million to $12 million required would not be available until Nov. 15 to Dec. 1.</p>
        <p>MirCorp announced last week that it hoped to raise $117 million for Mir projects in a stock offering. Dr. Kathuria said the company was arranging details of the offering, including underwriters, which it expects to complete by February.</p>
        <p>MirCorp also has signed commercial agreements to bring in tens of millions of dollars, he said, including a $20 million deal to send an American financier, Dennis Tito, to Mir as the first space tourist and another $20 million project, with NBC-TV, for a reality-based television series, ''Destination Mir,'' that would send a winning contestant into space next year.</p>
        <p>''We are showing that space can be commercialized profitably,'' Dr. Kathuria said. ''It would be a tragedy if Mir were 'de-orbited.' It's an irreplaceable asset.''</p>
        <p>But Yuri Semenov, president of RSC Energia, the Russian company that built and operates Mir and is a MirCorp partner, expressed skepticism last week that MirCorp could save the station. Dr. Semenov said in an interview here that he doubted whether MirCorp, where he is a board member, could raise enough money soon enough to save Mir. If the money, including the proceeds from the stock offering, could have arrived last spring, there would have been time to order new spacecraft and rockets to service Mir, as well as keep Russia's commitments to the International Space Station.</p>
        <p>''I think that we lost the time,'' he said through an interpreter. ''It pains me to say it. MirCorp is a very good company and tried very hard. But it was too late.''</p>
