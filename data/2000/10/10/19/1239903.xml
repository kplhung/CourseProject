        <p>MICK BIRD, a burly Hawaiian-born adventurer, says  he is determined to challenge the world's major oceans one on one. This fall he began the fourth and longest leg -- 8,000 miles across the Indian Ocean -- in his attempt to be the first person to circle the globe alone in a rowboat.</p>
        <p>Last year he completed 204 days of rowing across the Pacific from California, where he lives with his wife and twin 4-year-old daughters in Los Angeles, to Australia. Now Mr. Bird, 44, a musician and a motivational speaker, is rowing from Australia to South Africa.</p>
        <p>He makes his watery treks alone, without trailing craft or observation planes. He does, however, take to the high seas with high technology: three laptop computers, Global Positioning System navigation equipment, a digital camera and a satellite telephone to link him to the rest of the world and upload his digitized words, pictures and video to the Web.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview before leaving Australia, he said he expected to cross the Indian Ocean in about six months, rowing about 30 miles each day and riding the currents. Much of the trip's expense is being underwritten by companies. Tuneinsports.com sponsors his Web site (www.naau.com). Lightspan (www.lightspan.com), an educational group based in California, set up a global network of 32,000 schools so students could participate electronically in his voyage.</p>
        <p>Now in his fourth week at sea, Mr. Bird said in a dispatch filed Tuesday that he woke up to dozens of dolphins leaping and circling his boat. He said he also saw a baby shark and some sea snakes. ''It was a regular circus out here today,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>In one of his daily updates last week Mr. Bird noted that he was making ''slow and steady progress westward.'' In the phone interview, he said he expected the trip to be exhilarating as well as an ordeal. During his western Pacific voyage, which he started in August 1997, Mr. Bird lost 60 pounds, he said.</p>
        <p>Before he leaves on his journeys, he said, his wife, Stacia, always makes fun of his training regimen,  calling it ''getting fat.''</p>
        <p>''Yes, you need to be in some level of physical condition before you shove off,'' Mr. Bird said, adding that passion to complete a dream that has lived within him for years helped fuel his muscles. ''So much of the effort,'' he added, ''is from the heart.''</p>
