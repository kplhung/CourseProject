        <p>Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, courted the labor vote in the center of the state today, while he and his Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, attacked each other with new television commercials.</p>
        <p>Joined by the president of the New Jersey State A.F.L.-C.I.O., Charles Wowkanech, and a handful of other union leaders, Mr. Corzine rode a chartered bus out of Trenton and spent most of the day visiting union workers at four places: the sprawling construction site for a Merrill Lynch office building in Hopewell Township, union headquarters for electrical workers in Trenton, and distribution warehouses in Edison and Cranbury.</p>
        <p>But the day did not always move with assembly-line smoothness. Mr. Corzine's schedule had listed a three-hour afternoon visit with auto workers at a Ford plant here. But late Tuesday, Ford canceled the stop because the official host, the plant's business manager, was called away on other business, said Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Tom Shea.</p>
        <p>By late morning, Mr. Corzine's tour was running about an hour behind schedule. He missed a chance to address about 100 workers gathered for lunch at a warehouse here that ships shoes and other merchandise to about 850 Sears Roebuck stores around the country. He arrived about 12:30, after most workers had left the cafeteria at the center, owned by Automated Distribution Systems, and returned to their jobs.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Corzine was chatty and affable with about 20 workers who lingered in the cafeteria, a multimillionaire seemingly at ease with entry-level workers. Many of the company's 250 workers are immigrants from Haiti, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. About 100 recently registered to vote during a campaign held by their union, Local 108 of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine congratulated them and asked for their votes. ''If you work real hard for me for the next 20 days, I'll work hard for you the next six years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine remains comfortably ahead in the polls but has yet to surpass the 50 percent level of support in any independent survey. In the advertisement he released today, he intensified his effort to sour voters on his lesser-known opponent by focusing on recent votes Mr. Franks missed in Congress while campaigning or fund-raising in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''He's being paid by the taxpayers,'' the commercial says. ''But he's not showing up for work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, meanwhile, for the first time began running his own television commercials in the New York City media market. The ads, 15 seconds long, hit Mr. Corzine on the themes Mr. Franks has been emphasizing for weeks: that Mr. Corzine is trying to buy the election and that he is deceptive and untrustworthy.</p>
        <p>The ads are slightly more pointed than ones Mr. Franks is running in Philadelphia. They quote newspaper editorials calling Mr. Corzine a ''big-spending political novice'' and his proposals ''impossibly expensive.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Franks's ad spending is a drop in Mr. Corzine's bucket. A Franks spokesman, Peter DeMarco, said Mr. Franks was spending only $150,000 in New York on the new ads, and $45,000 in Philadelphia. They are likely to be drowned out by Mr. Corzine's commercials, given that the Democrat is spending close to $2 million a week on television time.</p>
