        <p>Federal prosecutors investigating how the Police Department handles brutality cases have briefed police union officials on findings that they contend show how serious lapses in department procedures allowed brutal officers to go unpunished, according to several union officials.</p>
        <p>The lapses, detailed in a series of meetings, include what the prosecutors characterized as the department's failure to find witnesses who were readily available, the failure to track problem officers with repeat violations and the premature dismissal of serious cases.</p>
        <p>The overview described by the union officials represents the most detailed picture to emerge from a three-year inquiry by the United States attorney in Brooklyn. The investigation stems from accusations that the Police Department's failure to discipline officers in excessive force cases has fostered a climate of brutality.</p>
        <p>Protracted negotiations between the city and federal prosecutors have continued for more than a year in efforts to reach agreement on proposed changes. Federal authorities have threatened that if the talks fail, they will sue under a 1994 civil rights law and seek to impose a federal monitor. The city's corporation counsel, Michael D. Hess, would not comment, and Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, said it would be inappropriate for any interested party to discuss the case publicly.</p>
        <p>The union officials, who sought the meetings to present rebuttal evidence, said that in recent weeks they have attended two sessions with prosecutors in New York and one at the Justice Department in Washington. They said no evidence presented to them so far seemed to constitute anything more than isolated instances of the failure of the department's disciplinary system.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to show them that the number of cases, even if they are 100 percent correct, is so minute in the overall scheme of 41,000 law enforcement officers that it certainly shouldn't warrant a federal monitor,'' said Thomas J. Scotto, the president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, one of five unions represented at the meetings.</p>
        <p>The officials said that prosecutors told them that they had found instances where the Police Department appeared to have done a very sloppy job of investigating brutality complaints against officers. In a number of instances, the prosecutors said, interns working for them had been able to easily identify and contact witnesses in brutality cases even though seasoned police investigators had maintained that those witnesses were unreachable, thereby forcing cases to be dismissed.</p>
        <p>Union officials, however, said they had not been given any indication that this problem was widespread. They said there was ample evidence to suggest that the department's attitude toward internal discipline was not cavalier, like the increased number of officers disciplined for a wide range of offenses in recent years.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a staunch defender of the department, recently said that there was merit to the findings of the federal inquiry, acknowledging that there had been problems with some department procedures in brutality cases. But he strongly resists the imposition of a court-ordered federal monitor for the department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said this month that he supported improvements in how the department handles abuse cases substantiated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent city agency, but he provided no specifics.</p>
        <p>There has been some agreement between the two sides on several important changes sought by the prosecutors, but among the sticking points has been the mechanism that would be used to enforce them. Federal authorities want any agreement enforced by a consent decree signed by a federal judge. The city favors an oversight plan in which a monitor would be appointed by the mayor, and in the event of an insoluble disagreement between the parties, the prosecutors could sue.</p>
        <p>The federal inquiry into how the department investigates and disciplines officers accused of using excessive force began in August 1997 after the torture of Abner Louima in the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. Using a federal civil rights statute passed after the videotaped police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, the prosecutors sought to determine whether the department's failures in handling brutality cases resulted in ''a pattern or practice'' of violating people's civil rights.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors conducted an exhaustive review of records provided by the Police Department, examining hundreds of cases in which officers were accused of using excessive force, in some instances re-investigating the cases, and reviewing the discipline that was meted out.</p>
        <p>The recent meetings with union officials stemmed from their complaints that they had not been brought into the process, the officials said. At the sessions, the prosecutors also outlined several other areas in which they said their investigation had uncovered problems, the union officials said.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors said they found that ''systemic deficiencies are leading to constitutional deprivations,'' and they cited the failure to investigate officers accused of brutality in civil lawsuits or to effectively monitor those against whom many complaints had been filed, union officials said.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors also said the department dismissed some serious cases based on the expiration of the 18-month statute of limitations that applies to administrative discipline, even though a 1995 decision by the corporation counsel said the 18-month rule did not apply to cases that involve a potential criminal violation, the officials said.</p>
        <p>But union officials said that the federal prosecutors had not described the scope of the lapses in detail, leading them to believe that the actual number of missteps uncovered by the investigation was small. They acknowledged, however, that the briefings were not intended to present them with all the evidence that had been collected. Federal prosecutors have declined to disclose the breadth of their findings, citing the continuing negotiations.</p>
        <p>The union officials contended that the premise of the inquiry-- that systemic failures have emboldened brutal officers to act with impunity -- is belied by statistics showing that the number of excessive force complaints against officers has steadily dropped since 1995.</p>
        <p>''It is my position that if officers were acting with impunity, the number of force allegations would not be going down,'' said John Driscoll, president of the Captains' Endowment Association, which represents several ranks of supervisory officers. In addition to Mr. Driscoll and Mr. Scotto, the heads of the unions for police officers, sergeants and lieutenants attended the sessions, along with their lawyers.</p>
