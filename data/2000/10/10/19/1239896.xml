        <p>Can giant pandas, who dislike hot and humid weather, find happiness in a muggy Washington summer? What if designers could find a way to air-condition their outdoor pens? Those questions may be answered next year, if negotiations succeed in bringing two giant pandas, Mei Xiang, a 2-year-old female, and Tian Tian, a 3-year-old male, from China to the Panda House at the National Zoo. The house was once home to Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, above, until their deaths, Ling-Ling's in 1992 and Hsing-Hsing's last year. To lure the new pandas outdoors on even the hottest days, the zoo hired Chatelain Architects of Washington and Nelson-Byrd Landscape Architects of Charlottesville, Va., to renovate their home and create outdoor microclimates. Imagine the wilds of China in a 17,500-square-foot outdoor exhibition area divided into two grassy yards. Although both yards are planted with Chinese firs, hemlocks and red cedars, each has a different microclimate. ''One side has a grove of trees with a mister in it,'' said Robert Hoage, a zoo spokesman. ''The other has the same grove of trees, but with a fogger in it, where smaller drops of water roll out like fog.'' In one den, the air is cooled by traveling over cold-water pipes; the other (above) has an ordinary air-conditioner. Scientists want to see which environment makes a panda happy.</p>
