        <p>Detroit (4-2) at Tampa Bay (3-3)8:30 p.m. Eastern TV: ESPN  Detroit has lost receiver Germane Crowell for a few weeks because of a broken foot. Crowell had become its go-to guy and he has produced admirably over the past two seasons. He has a natural flair at the position and unique big-play ability. He may be the most underrated receiver in pro football. But Crowell got his chance when the veteran Herman Moore was injured last year, and now Moore gains a shot to recapture the spotlight. This game, after three straight losses, means too much to Tampa Bay. Expect its defense to re-energize and its offense, especially back Warrick Dunn, to hit a new stride. Buccaneers, 23-13</p>
