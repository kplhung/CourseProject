        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>BUCKING A TREND -- Candidates often boast when they are better financed than their opponents. But there are other approaches.</p>
        <p>A few days ago, Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, locked in a battle with former Representative Maria Cantwell, an Internet millionaire who is largely financing her own Democratic campaign, issued a press release pointing out how much she was outspending him.</p>
        <p>In past elections, Mr. Gorton, a Republican, usually outspent his opponents. With the situation reversed, he came up with a new line of attack, accusing Ms. Cantwell of trying to buy her way into the Senate.</p>
        <p>''Check out the following data on TV air time,'' the Gorton press release advised, From Sept. 1 to Oct. 10, ''Cantwell ran 3,109 TV spots, compared to 1,345 for Gorton.'' The Gorton-Cantwell contest is already the most expensive Senate race in the state's history.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>CALIFORNIA CONCLUSIONS Vice President Al Gore is at a critical juncture in California, says one of his political advisers there. Citing polls showing Gov. George W. Bush gaining, the adviser, Garry South, said some leading California Democrats had concluded it was past time for the vice president to begin an advertising blitz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign aides rejected Mr. South's analysis, suggesting that his goal was to widen Mr. Gore's 10-point lead in the state to the point that other Democratic candidates would be pulled along.</p>

        <p>THE AD CAMPAIGN</p>
        <p>INSPIRING YOUNG VOTERS -- Rock the Vote, a nonpartisan, nonprofit voter registration organization with close ties to Democrats, has produced several new public service announcements that seek to inspire those ages 18 to 24 to vote on Election Day. The 30-second spots, which went on the air nationwide last week on MTV, show young people confronting a political system dominated by special interests or biased law enforcement officials.</p>
        <p>In one commercial, a young woman with a broken leg and in a wheelchair has her credit card rejected at a pharmacy when the cost of her prescription drugs totals $352.40. The advertisement's tag line says the pharmaceutical industry gave more than $1 million to senators in 1999, suggesting that the contributions helped block access to cheaper drugs.</p>

        <p>THE ELECTORATE</p>
        <p>BUYING VOTES -- A Web site offering to sell 15,000 votes for president to the highest bidder is under investigation by the authorities in California and Illinois, and officials in Michigan and New York have objected to the site. But the Austrian investors who own the site say they will never name the bidders or voters.</p>
        <p>The site, voteauction.com, which recently quoted a going price per vote of $19.61 in California and $12.38 in Illinois, allows voters to sign up to sell their votes by filling out their name, address, age, nationality, and household income. Buyers can bid for an entire block of votes from a state. The site promises to collect votes by absentee ballot, verify them and mail them.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>Their third and final debate over, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush returned to the campaign trail yesterday, each focusing again on the crucial swing states in the upper Midwest. The stats:</p>
        <p>States visited: Gore, 4; Bush, 3  Cities/towns visited: Gore, 4; Bush, 3  Official Events: Gore, 2; Bush, 3  Plane boardings: Gore, 3; Bush, 3  Main message: Gore, Social Security and maintaining prosperity; Bush, the Gore plan is the wrong plan.</p>
