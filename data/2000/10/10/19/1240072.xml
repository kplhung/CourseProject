        <p>A traffic officer who also serves as the treasurer of a public employees union was charged in court yesterday with cheating two recent immigrants of more than $1,600 while running a tax and immigration aid business.</p>
        <p>Two women paid the officer, Fernando Rodriguez, 46, a Police Department employee who is also a certified public accountant, to help them with tax and immigration paperwork, but he funneled the money to his union and to himself, said Lee Llambelis, an assistant district attorney.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez is the treasurer of Local 983, which represents 3,500 city employees who drive motor vehicles. He was arraigned yesterday in Manhattan on charges of scheming to defraud, grand larceny and petty larceny.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez, who lives in Hackensack, N.J., faces up to four years in prison if convicted. The charges follow a 10-month investigation by the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau.</p>
        <p>Local 983 is part of District Council 37, an umbrella union of municipal employees that has been plagued by corrupt officials and long-running criminal investigations. Mark Rosenthal, president of Local 983, said he did not know of any illegal activities involving Mr. Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez ran his business out of a travel agency on 47th Street near Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, Ms. Llambelis said. That was where Arcelia Zacarias approached him in 1998 for help with her taxes. Ms. Zacarias gave him an unaddressed postal money order worth $651 to pay taxes that she owed in 1997, Ms. Llambelis said.</p>
        <p>He gave Ms. Zacarias, a cleaning woman who made $6,000 a year, a receipt showing that he was making the payment to the Internal Revenue Service, the complaint said, but the I.R.S. soon notified Ms. Zacarias that her taxes had not been paid.</p>
        <p>The United States Postal Service later told investigators that the money order was made out to ''Local 983 DC 37 AFSCME'' and had a note saying that the payment would go to a Hurricane George relief fund, according to the complaint.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zacarias's sister, Rosio, also went to Mr. Rodriguez, seeking help with her immigration petition. She gave him more than $1,000 in cash and a postal money order to be made out to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to pay for fees, the complaint said. Investigators later found that the money order, whose amount was not specified in the complaint, was deposited into Mr. Rodriguez's bank account, according to the complaint.</p>
        <p>''He used money collected from these individuals to benefit himself or ventures related to his union activities,'' Ms. Llambelis said in court yesterday.</p>
        <p>She added that Mr. Rodriguez was convicted in 1986 on a federal conspiracy charge, but she declined to elaborate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez was suspended by the Police Department, where he has worked since 1986. In 1998, Local 983 elected him treasurer, largely because he was an accountant. He handled an annual budget of $500,000 and helped the local pay off more than $100,000 of debt to District Council 37.</p>
        <p>''It's a surprise to me because Fernando has done a really good job,'' said Mr. Rosenthal, who ran for union president on an anticorruption platform. ''But I have to maintain the integrity of Local 983, and I'm going to ask him to resign.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, an official of District Council 37 pleaded guilty to stealing more than $3,000 by using a corporate credit card to pay for personal items. Last week, two vice presidents pleaded guilty to pilfering hospitality money and taking vacations with it.</p>
        <p>And in July, two top former officials were convicted of helping rig a 1995 contract ratification vote.</p>
        <p>Police officials and prosecutors said that they were still investigating whether Mr. Rodriguez duped more victims.</p>
