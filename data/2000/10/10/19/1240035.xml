        <p>For at least one heterogeneous audience, here in one of the most closely contested battleground states of the campaign, the final presidential debate of 2000 was more about reinforcing political views previously reached than about arriving at new conclusions.</p>
        <p>Almost without exception, a group of 20-odd voters in southeastern Michigan, who gathered at the request of The New York Times at Wallace House, just off the campus of the University of Michigan, said after watching the 90-minute television encounter between Vice President Al Gore and Gov.

        <p>For at least one heterogeneous audience, here in one of the most closely contested battleground states of the campaign, the final presidential debate of 2000 was more about reinforcing political views previously reached than about arriving at new conclusions.</p>
        <p>Almost without exception, a group of 20-odd voters in southeastern Michigan, who gathered at the request of The New York Times at Wallace House, just off the campus of the University of Michigan, said after watching the 90-minute television encounter between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Tuesday evening that their voting plans were unchanged.</p>
        <p>But many of them -- black, white, young, old, city folks, suburbanites, teachers, students -- were clearly dissatisfied with what they heard.</p>
        <p>Republicans, Democrats and ticket-splitters alike laughed derisively when Mr. Gore, in one of his family-friendly moments, announced that all his children had made independent decisions to fly to St. Louis to watch the debate. One member of the group later called the remark ''stupid.'' Another said it was ''corny.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush refused to give a yes-or-no answer to the question of whether he supports affirmative action, a lot of groans and a few hisses  resounded through the room.</p>
        <p>And in a post-debate discussion, which lasted for almost an hour, several participants complained about Mr. Gore's style. Fewer focused on his policy positions, although some found fault with his spending plans.</p>
        <p>Marisa Buchanan, 21, a senior at the University of Michigan, said that she had been more impressed by Mr. Bush, even though she tended to agree with the vice president on issues. She said that she found Mr. Gore ''a caricature of himself'' whose oratory was ''overdone, even for politics.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Ms. Buchanan continued: ''I found myself leaning towards Bush at the end, although I must admit I still don't like him. I've always had the impression that he says what other people tell him to say. But he seemed tonight to mean things, like when he defended his position on the death penalty. He appeared very sincere.''</p>
        <p>Mark Hadesh, 56, the owner of several small businesses, reached a different conclusion, though he, too, was bothered by Mr. Gore's manner.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore's tedious,'' Mr. Hadesh said. ''He makes me twitch. It's hard for me to listen to him. But when George Bush says he doesn't trust Washington, it means nothing. It's not nearly enough to persuade me to vote for him.''</p>
        <p>Another in the group said he thought that when Mr. Gore walked over to Mr. Bush while the latter was speaking, he briefly feared that the vice president ''was going to smack him.'' And Norman J. Rotter, a neurosurgeon who lives in Oakland County, one of the pivotal suburban areas north of Detroit, said he worried that Mr. Gore was ''too arrogant'' to represent the United States effectively in negotiations with other countries, especially poor ones.</p>
        <p>Peter Thomas, a computer consultant who grew up poor in Detroit, said that he found many of Mr. Gore's ideas ''too grandiose,'' especially his promises to make all American schools excellent and to nurture a world at peace.</p>
        <p>''I'm from the inner city,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''I went to Kettering High School, and I have no hope that it will ever be excellent, so I want vouchers to send my kids to the best schools possible. I also doubt that we'll see peace any time soon in the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>Dick Siegel, a singer and songwriter, said he was considering voting for Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, ''but not if it would elect Bush.''  He was opposed ''intellectually and spiritually,'' he said, to the Texan's positions and what he termed his ''good old boy'' personality. But he added, he found Mr. Gore ''a strange man,'' which bothered him.</p>
        <p>''Gore's inherently a bully,'' said Richard Boothman, 45, a lawyer and a Republican. ''He's in your face, all the time. Bush had a theme: that he knew how to build coalitions between parties, and he'd done it in Texas.''</p>
        <p>Simone D. Lightfoot, the Detroit coordinator for the N.A.A.C.P. National Voter Fund, said that as a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, she found Mr. Bush's criticisms of American military preparedness convincing. But she said she could not join in the complaints about Mr. Gore's manner. She explained: ''I prefer a leader who's aggressive and outspoken, so I thought Gore did very well.  Gore had the details. Bush said what he wanted, Gore how he'd get there.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca Blank, 45, the dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at Michigan, took strong exception to the other part of Mr. Boothman's comment. An economist and a Democrat, she said that she thought Mr. Bush's coalition theme completely fallacious.</p>
        <p>''That was the area in which Mr. Bush had the least credibility,'' she said, ''that he could go to Washington and make it work. I don't see any evidence at all -- he gave none -- that Texas prepared him to deal with Congress.''</p>
        <p>Michael Staebler, 57, a Detroit lawyer, agreed that ''Texas is very different from Washington.'' A son of Neil Staebler, a longtime Democratic chairman and national committeeman in this state, he said that the political divisions were not nearly as deep in Austin as in Washington and the political problems in the state legislature were a good deal less complex.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had other defenders.  Nancy Reame, 53, a professor of nursing, said that he offered ''more substantive strategies'' on education and other major matters.</p>
        <p>''I listened for specifics from Bush, but I didn't hear them,'' she said.  ''All I heard were generalities. Neither of them paid a lot of attention to women's issues like abortion and hand guns. Bush talked a lot about taking the government out of our lives, but not as far as abortion is concerned.''</p>
        <p>Her husband, Ron, 54, chairman of New Horizons Graphic Computer Learning, much preferred Mr. Bush's demeanor, describing him as more courteous.</p>
        <p>''But Gore's statements were clearer,'' Mr. Reame, a Republican, said. ''Gore was on target all evening. Bush, no. Bush tired at the end and seemed to run out of material. He was falling apart, not answering questions, sometimes not even following them well.''</p>
        <p>Mike Spahn, 21, the editor of The Michigan Daily, a student newspaper, said Mr. Bush had failed to answer questions and had failed to reply effectively to Mr. Gore's accusations, like the vice president's insistence that the Bush tax plan favored the richest 1 percent of Americans.</p>
        <p>Whereas Mr. Bush ''deflected all the tough questions,'' said Peter Eckstein, a retired economist, Mr. Gore ''showed his experience during the last eight years and effectively laid out what this administration has accomplished.''</p>
        <p>Not for Paul Nine, 60, a lawyer, from Oakland County.</p>
        <p>''Gore proved to us all tonight that he learned his lessons from Clinton,'' he said. ''Just like Clinton, he disregarded the rules -- interrupting, asking questions when he wasn't supposed to, all that. In this country we're taught that everyone plays by the same rules, but these people don't do it.''</p>
