        <p>Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned for support among Jewish voters yesterday, with Mr. Lazio meeting rabbis and Orthodox Jewish leaders in Flatbush and Borough Park, and Mrs. Clinton visiting a synagogue damaged in a suspicious fire in Syracuse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, also sought to expand his electoral appeal by assembling a group of little-known Democratic supporters on the steps of City Hall.</p>
        <p>For the second time in two weeks, Mr. Lazio trumpeted the endorsement of Dr. Mark S. McMahon, the physician who ran an unsuccessful primary against Hillary Rodham Clinton last month, as he once again assailed Mrs. Clinton's run for Senate in a state she is not from.</p>
        <p>''There is one thing that we all share: we are all New Yorkers,'' Mr. Lazio said, as some of his supporters shouted ''right on,'' and other members of ''Democrats for Lazio'' popped open umbrellas to protect themselves against a rain storm.</p>
        <p>''We put New York first,'' Mr. Lazio continued. ''We expect leadership for New York, from New York. We expect someone to be in the Senate who will put New York's interest first.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lazio spoke in the rain, another well-known Republican, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, emerged on the steps. He ignored the cluster of politicians and reporters, not an unusual sight there, and hurried off without acknowledging the  man who filled the void when he dropped out of the race.</p>
        <p>Later, the mayor said that he had seen Mr. Lazio on the steps, but had not been informed that Mr. Lazio was coming to his office.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know he was going to be here,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, an aide to Mr. Lazio, said that Mr. Lazio's campaign had informed Mr. Giuliani's office that Mr. Lazio would be showing up on his doorstep.</p>
        <p>''The mayor's office was fully aware of the endorsement press conference today,'' Mr. McLagan asserted.</p>
        <p>''We did not personally and specifically invite the mayor because, well, he's a Republican.''</p>
        <p>In her third straight day in upstate New York, Mrs. Clinton addressed a Baptist convention at a church in downtown Syracuse, invoking the fire that damaged Temple Beth El  there and the explosion in Yemen on the destroyer Cole to stir the predominantly black gathering.</p>
        <p>''These two events certainly reminded me forcefully of how much we have to be grateful for,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>''I believe that our politics should reflect our best values,'' she said. ''This election on Nov. 7 will determine whether we keep expanding the circle of opportunity to include more and more Americans, whether we will be satisfied that we have done so well in the last eight years or whether we will build on the strong foundation that has been established.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''The good way is toward equality.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton inspected the fire-damaged parts of the synagogue, which was still heavy with an acrid, smoky smell and bore the marks of the fire last Friday in charred walls and sagging roof girders with Rabbi Irvin Beigel and Jackie Kassel, the president of the 200-family congregation, at her side.</p>
        <p>The authorities have called the fire  arson, but have established no motive.</p>
        <p>'It's a terrible reminder of what can happen, but it is also, talking to people here, the rabbi and president of the congregation, a very encouraging and optimistic note that they're getting right down to work and they're going to be back here worshiping and carrying on the life of the community,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn last night, Mr. Lazio first went to Borough Park, where he attended a street fair celebrating Sukkot, the Jewish feast of thanksgiving, and was warmly received by crowds that clustered around him.</p>
        <p>Then he traveled to Flatbush to mEet with Rabbi Saul Kassin, chief rabbi of an organization called the Syrian Jewish Community. Before entering Rabbi Kassin's house, Mr. Lazio offered his views on the finding, issued earlier in the day in Washington by the independent counsel, that Mrs. Clinton had given ''factually false'' testimony in the Travelgate investigation.</p>
        <p>''I think Mrs. Clinton does not always believe the law applies to her,'' he told reporters. ''It applies equally to everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's decision to hold a second news conference announcing his support by Dr. McMahon was the target of some joshing by Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which fired off an e-mail press release with the headline ''Newsflash: McMahon Endorses Lazio . . . Again!''</p>
        <p>''Today's endorsement is the most exciting thing that has happened to the Lazio campaign since the last time Mark McMahon endorsed the congressman.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Lazio must be very proud of such a high-profile endorsement since he keeps announcing it,'' said Mr. Wolfson, a Clinton spokesman.</p>
