        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush entered the three presidential debates with strikingly different objectives. For Mr. Bush, it was to persuade Americans that he was no slacker but a leader of presidential stature, a Washington outsider and a fresh alternative to the Democrats' tax-and-spend tradition.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, the goal was more ambitious: to score a knockout. He wanted to demonstrate that he towered over Mr. Bush in his command of the issues, that he was independent of the Clinton administration and that he was a fighter for the middle class. And he was determined that questions about his personality not distract voters from the issues.</p>
        <p>After four-and-a-half hours before tens of millions of Americans, the initial reading of many strategists and academics is that Mr. Bush,  whose campaign tried mightily last month to limit his exposure in the debates, met more of his objectives.</p>
        <p>''Candidly, I think Bush gained the most of them just by surviving,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist in Chicago who sometimes advises the Gore campaign. ''There was an unrealistic expectation among some Democrats that Gore would just grind him in the dust and that Bush would be tongue-tied and tearful.''</p>
        <p>Even so, many analysts said Mr. Gore finally seemed to find his voice in the last debate, while Mr. Bush was more halting and less articulate than in earlier performances. It is no accident that Gore officials yesterday said they wanted to deliver videotapes of the third debate -- not the first or second -- to cable television stations around the country.</p>
        <p>So now that the voters have seen the strengths and weaknesses of both candidates, this is the question as the campaign enters its final stretch: Will Americans come away from the three debates remembering Mr. Bush's more assured performances in the first two? Or will Mr. Gore's more sure-footed showing in the last debate take hold? Or will the events leave the voters more confused and unsure about their choice?</p>
        <p>''It was a rare series of debates that never had a moment of clarity where everything came into sharp focus,'' said Alan Schroeder, an authority on presidential debates who is a journalism professor at Northeastern University in Boston. ''So it was frustrating.''</p>
        <p>While the debates may have further muddled the contest, it is undeniable that Mr. Bush, for whatever reason, is in a better position than he was before the first debate in Boston three weeks ago. At that time, Mr. Bush was veering downward in the polls and drawing harsh publicity for pressing a debate proposal that seemed more favorable to him than the three prime-time debates planned by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.</p>
        <p>It could be that by the time voter sentiment settles out, Mr. Gore may have gained from the last debate. But, for now, Mr. Bush can claim to have stemmed his dip in the polls -- and even inched ahead of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush can declare the debates a success for his candidacy if for no other reason than that he showed he could go up against Mr. Gore -- who was regarded as a vaunted debater.</p>
        <p>''The big consideration in peoples' minds was, 'Is Bush up to the job?' And I think the debates basically answered that for a lot of people,'' said Morris P. Fiorina, a professor of political science at Stanford University. '' 'O.K., he may not be a genius, but he's O.K. on that dimension.' On the part of Gore, there were personality questions, and concerns, and the debate served to magnify those in the eyes of some.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Gore found himself in the uncomfortable position of competing against his own performance, bowing at first to the initial critiques that he was too aggressive and then to the conclusion that he was too meek. Comparing himself to Goldilocks, Mr. Gore said yesterday on ABC's ''Good Morning America'' program: ''The first was too hot. The second was too cool. The third one was just right.''</p>
        <p>One reason that the debates, thus far, do not seem to have shaken the fundamental dynamics of an extraordinarily tight race is that neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Bush was inclined to toss off one-liners or make any dramatic moves, probably out of fear that they could backfire.</p>
        <p>Asked what people will remember from these debates 10 or 20 years from now, several academics and politicians came back with the identical answer: absolutely nothing. Many said they were more impressed by the sober-minded dialogue of the vice-presidential contenders in their debate than the people on top of the tickets.</p>
        <p>''I can't find any moments in these debates that are memorable,'' said Don Hewitt, the creator of ''60 Minutes'' who was a producer of the first televised presidential debates in 1960. ''We went in with the idea that Bush ain't the smartest kid in the class. And I don't think we knew that Gore was quite so boring. That may be the sum total of what happened in these debates.''</p>
        <p>While the candidates put forth starkly different philosophies on many issues, the focus of the press -- and in numerous interviews with voters -- seemed to be on the stylistic differences. There was far more attention, for instance, to Mr. Gore's audible sighs in the first debate than his musings on the issues.</p>
        <p>The candidates, perhaps, could have differentiated themselves even more, perhaps, had they not passed up opportunities to be more bold. On Tuesday night, for example, Mr. Bush was handed a perfect opening after Mr. Gore, speaking of the disaffection with politics among young people, criticized Mr. Bush for opposing the McCain-Feingold campaign finance measure. The governor could have reminded viewers about the Buddhist temple fund-raiser and other questions about his opponent's fund-raising practices.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore passed up an opportunity to try to portray Mr. Bush as an extremist on guns. Rather than remind viewers that Mr. Bush backed legislation in Texas that would permit the carrying of concealed weapons in churches, hospitals and nursing homes, Mr. Gore presented himself as a defender of gun owners. ''None of my proposals,'' he said, ''would have an effect on hunters or sportsmen or people who use rifles.''</p>
        <p>With the all-important swing voters not quite ready to swing one way or another, it could be that the debates merely emboldened partisans to conclude from all the strengths and weakness that were on display that they should support the candidate they favored in the first place.</p>
        <p>''What you saw in Bush was a geniality and accessibility but not great mastery or strength, for that matter,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''In Gore, you saw strength and leadership and mastery, but not warmth.'' Though he hardly sounded enthusiastic, Mr. Axelrod is backing Mr. Gore, in part because warmth is low on his list of requirements.</p>
        <p>Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, insisted personality was important. ''My view is that the country did get to know both guys better and that helped Bush,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For all the buildup to the debates, some people argue that there was too much pressure on the candidates to make the debates decisive events. The truth is, in and of themselves, debates do not have a track record of altering the fundamentals of a race.</p>
        <p>''The problem is we tried to make these debates a big deal,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''And I'm not sure, at least in this case, that they were.''</p>
