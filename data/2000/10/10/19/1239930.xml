        <p>On tap are medleys from ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''Where's Charley?'' and ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.''

Interludes between medleys will focus on songs he wrote for Hollywood in the 1930's. With Jonathan Schwartz, the series' artistic director, as host, the concerts will feature vocalists like Christine Andreas, Billy Stritch, Lilias White, Margaret Whiting and Tom Wopat.

        <p>On tap are medleys from ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''Where's Charley?'' and ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.'' But even more is promised when the third season of ''Lincoln Center's American Songbook'' begins this weekend with a celebration of the songwriter Frank Loesser.

With Jonathan Schwartz, the series' artistic director, as host, the concerts will feature vocalists like Christine Andreas, Billy Stritch, Lilias White, Margaret Whiting and Tom Wopat. ''Heart and Soul: The Songs of Frank Loesser'' is scheduled for 8 p.m. tomorrow and Saturday in Alice Tully Hall.</p>
        <p>Popular Fellow</p>
        <p>The composer and conductor Marvin Hamlisch dons a new hat tomorrow. He'll become the first Principal Pops Conductor in the 69-year history of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington. This season he will lead 9 of the 18 pops concerts, beginning this weekend with three devoted to Rodgers, Kern, Bernstein and Gershwin.</p>
        <p>Close Call</p>
        <p>Exhibited first in Detroit, then in Boston, more than 70 paintings and drawings by Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) will reach the final stop on their tour on Sunday when ''Van Gogh: Face to Face'' opens at the Philadelphia Museum of Art for a run through Jan. 14. Described as the first comprehensive museum show devoted to the full range of the artist's portraiture, ''Face to Face,'' with many works new to the United States, includes five arresting self-portraits.</p>
        <p>To Collect and Preserve</p>
        <p>Among the 14.6 million items at the Smithsonian Institution that document the history of the visual arts in America are letters and diaries of artists and collectors, photographs of art world figures. Today though Jan. 5, a selection of these treasures will be on view  at the Archives' New York Regional Center at the PaineWebber Building, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street.</p>
        <p>Crowd Pleaser</p>
        <p>He sings. He plays piano. He arranges. He composes. He transformed rhythm and blues into soul. He swings. He bops. In short, if it's pop, he does it. He is Ray Charles, and at 8 p.m. tomorrow, he will help Lehman Center for the Performing Arts celebrate its 20th anniversary with a performance at Lehman College in the Bronx.</p>
