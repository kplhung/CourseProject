        <p>Gov. George W. Bush plunged into the final three-week stretch of the presidential race today, arguing that Vice President Al Gore would endanger the nation's prosperity and using his own pledge of tax cutting to rally his party's base.</p>
        <p>Crisscrossing the swing state of Wisconsin on a glorious fall day, Mr. Bush, a Texas Republican, repeatedly criticized his Democratic opponent as a proponent of big government.</p>
        <p>''He's of the government,'' Mr. Bush thundered. ''He's for the government. He loves Washington, D.C.''</p>
        <p>And seeking to sway voters who consider prosperity an argument for  Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush said his opponent would actually endanger the good times.</p>
        <p>''The surest way to slow down our economy is to spend all our taxpayers' money down on bigger government,'' he told a large crowd in Eau Claire.</p>
        <p>On the day after the third and final presidential debate, the race was still considered a dead heat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush engaged in a delicate balancing act as he barnstormed across a state that voted twice for President Clinton but is considered up for grabs.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, he tried to fire up Republicans with sharply ideological broadsides against big government. He called the conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Yet he also sought to keep an appeal to independents and swing voters with promises of a new bipartisanship.</p>
        <p>''I'm here to let you know I'm going to work my heart out all the way to the finish,'' Mr. Bush told an airport rally. ''But I want your help. This is going to be a close election. Nobody should take anything for granted. It's going to be down to the wire, which means hard work and grass-roots people are going to make a big difference.''</p>
        <p>Yet he also told the Republicans: ''Don't be afraid to talk to those open-minded Democrats about a better day tomorrow. They don't want a huge federal government in their lives. They understand freedom. Don't be afraid to take our message to independents. There's unfinished business in our nation's capital.''</p>
        <p>He struck the same note at the E. O. Johnson Company. ''One of the reasons I've come is to ask you to tell your independents and Democrats to be open-minded,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>''Tax relief is important because its part of an economic growth package,'' he argued, saying the cuts ''serve as a stimulus to the economy. This is our school of thought.''</p>
        <p>Wisconsin's governor, Tommy G. Thompson, was far more pointed as he introduced Mr. Bush at a packed rally here in the afternoon. He said that Mr. Bush had been well raised by his parents but that Mr. Gore needed to learn the lessons taught by Robert Fulghum in his book ''All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.''</p>
        <p>''Don't interrupt people when they speak,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''He said, Don't be a bully. He said, Don't interrupt people. Come November,  We should send Al Gore back to kindergarten.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush scoffed at Mr. Gore's statement in Tuesday's debate that the vice president did not stand for big government. ''Now there's a man whose prone to exaggeration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was also seeking to frame the final days of the race as a choice between economic visions.  Tad Devine, a senior Gore strategist, seized on several of Mr. Bush's answers in Tuesday night's debate to argue that Mr. Bush ''demonstrated conclusively that he wanted to fight for the wealthy, not the rest of society.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Devine pointed to Mr. Bush's reply when the moderator, Jim Lehrer, asked him to respond to Mr. Gore's accusation that Mr. Bush's tax cut would mainly benefit the top 1 percent of wealthiest Americans. (Mr. Bush said, ''Of course it does.'') Mr. Devine also pointed to Mr. Bush's description of the word ''insurance'' as ''a Washington term.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush fired back today against accusations that he favors the well-to-do. ''That's the kind of language that's divisive,'' he said. ''It's the kind of language that pits one group  of people against another. It's called class warfare. That's the kind of language that will make it hard to get something done in Washington, D.C. America doesn't want class warfare. ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides declared themselves pleased with the outcome of the three presidential debates. ''I think we exceeded all expectations,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the governor's communications director. ''The debate phase was clearly a turning point. We have come out of the debate phase with the trend clearly in our direction.''</p>
        <p>Arguing that he would be the better steward of prosperity, Mr. Bush said there were warning signs of a recession on the horizon. He called his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut an ''insurance policy against an economic slowdown.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words: GEORGE W. BUSH</p>
        <p>Remarks yesterday at Eau Claire, Wis.:</p>
        <p>''The people of Wisconsin, they respect limited government. I thought last night it was one of the most telling moments in the debate when my opponent looked America in the eye and said he's absolutely against big government. Now there's a man who's prone to exaggeration. He wants to grow the size of the federal government. He believes in Washington. We believe in people. We're of the people and by the people and for the people. That's the motto of our campaign. . . .</p>
        <p>He's of the government. He's for government. He loves Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>Now there's a role for our government, but it's not to tell the average folks how to live their lives. ''</p>
