        <p>IT'S best to forget the Dr. Zhivago stuff when planting bulbs. Remember those drifts of daffodils and Julie Christie's tragic expression as ''Lara's Theme'' rose in crescendo? So where's Omar Sharif when you need help planting all those thousands of bulbs?</p>
        <p>Better to think in small pictures -- 500 snow crocuses planted in a little spill down the bank near the barn, or a golden wave of eranthis or winter aconite pouring across your hankie-size lawn in the city.</p>

        <p>IT'S best to forget the Dr. Zhivago stuff when planting bulbs. Remember those drifts of daffodils and Julie Christie's tragic expression as ''Lara's Theme'' rose in crescendo? So where's Omar Sharif when you need help planting all those thousands of bulbs?</p>
        <p>Better to think in small pictures -- 500 snow crocuses planted in a little spill down the bank near the barn, or a golden wave of eranthis or winter aconite pouring across your hankie-size lawn in the city.</p>
        <p>Then there are the so-called minor bulbs: glory-of-the-snow, scilla, fragrant grape hyacinths, adorable little species tulips like T. turkestanica and T. saxatilis. The more the better, because these harbingers of spring cure the deep blues of winter.</p>
        <p>If you don't already have snowdrops, plant a few hundred at least, scattering them by the dozens around the pockets of tree roots, by doorways, here and there in the rock garden, in masses under dogwoods and redbud trees. Don't be skimpy. Less than a dozen blooming over the snow look a bit lonely, as if they're thinking maybe they came up too early.</p>
        <p>And you can't have too many daffodils and tulips, of course, which bloom from April to late May if you plant the early, midspring and late varieties. The daffodil, which is the common name for narcissus, does not taste very good to chipmunks, voles and deer, so if some creature is eating all your tulips, interplanting the two might save the latter.</p>
        <p>I like planting clumps of daffodils by interesting things in the landscape, like the edge of a big rock outcropping, the door of the smokehouse or near the gnarled trunk of an old apple tree. My favorites, despite all the new faces, are the trumpets, like big yellow King Alfred and creamy white Mount Hood, which naturalize beautifully.</p>
        <p>Which reminds me: orchards (or even a grouping of trees) are fabulous places for a sea of daffodils, or red tulips and English bluebells planted together, because you can let the grass grow tall, to hide the foliage of the bulbs as it yellows.</p>
        <p>You can't trim off those limp leaves until all the nutrients have been absorbed by the bulbs for the next year's blooms. So don't plant these tall guys in the middle of your lawn if you start mowing in May (though the minor bulbs will be just fine). Better to plant clumps in the woodland garden, where you can hide the foliage with hostas and ferns, or in the sunny border with day lilies and peonies.</p>
        <p>As for tulips, I'm a sucker for the Darwins, known as ''perennial tulips,'' because they come back for five or six years. This year, I fell for a mammoth Darwin called Orange Bowl, whose scarlet petals seem licked by orange flames, and a couple of the green tulips, like Greenland, which is rose with soft green stripes, and Spring Green, white with pale green. I also love fragrant tulips like Princess Irene, an orange and purple early single variety, and Apricot Beauty, a midseason Triumph.</p>
        <p>The world of bulbs extends way beyond the day the last tulip loses its petals. Brightly colored ranunculus, whose tightly cupped, swirling petals always remind me of an old-fashioned rose just about to open, is a beautiful cut flower, particularly striking when it blooms among ferns in June and July.</p>
        <p>I've never liked that big silly showstopper Fritillaria imperialis, which looks like a pineapple with its yellow bells and tuft of green leaves atop a 36-inch stem and smells like a skunk. But I do love the little varieties, like F. michailowsky, whose reddish-purple bells are edged with gold, and F. meleagris, whose checkered flowers earned it the name guinea hen flower.</p>
        <p>Don't forget that irises, which bloom in June, should be planted now. I'm partial to Dutch iris, whose orchidlike flowers range from bright yellow to sky blue and violet-purple and look great in a vase.</p>
        <p>Camassia, which looks like a two-foot scilla with starry blue, violet or white flowers, loves moist soil, so it's best planted by the edge of a pond or a damp woodland. Wild gladiolus (Gladiolus byzantinus) is another favorite of mine, with its vibrant magenta flower and dark green leaves. Its simplicity makes its hybrid cousins look blousy.</p>
        <p>Alliums, members of the onion family, look just as good in the vegetable patch as in the herb or flower garden, from A. christophii, that fat purple globe of stars on a two-foot stem, to A. moly, which has graceful open clusters of bright yellow flowers. A related genus, Nectaroscordum siculum, has loose umbels of drooping green and purple bells, edged with white.</p>
        <p>Crocosmia, another summer-flowering bulb, produces fiery orange or scarlet star-shaped flowers on three-foot stems arching out of sword-shaped leaves. Eremurus, the foxtail lily or desert candle, so called for its spectacular spires of gold or orange, is another midsummer star for the perennial border. And so is Calochortus venustus, the Mariposa lily, a western native (and in fact not a lily at all) that ranges in color from white to yellow to red to purple, with striking blotches of color at the flower base.</p>
        <p>Lilies are a whole other story, of course. They start blooming by midsummer, Casa Blanca wafting its heady perfume all through the garden, and Turk's-cap lilies rising in the woods to six feet.</p>
        <p>But remember, it's a lot of work planting all these bulbs. So if you really do want a meadow of bluebells, invite some innocent city friends to the country for the weekend and put them to work. (They do pretty well, under constant supervision and offered plenty of wine and home cooking.)</p>
        <p>Such displays really are worth it. The Spanish bluebells (Hyacinthoides hispanica Excels) beneath the oak, birch and beech trees at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden are pretty spectacular, but it took two gardeners two weeks to plant 45,000 of them.</p>
        <p>I love tiny bulbs blooming under bare trees, like C. tomassinianus under the Caucasian wing nut tree at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, or Tulipa tarda under a bare dogwood or redbud tree. But you don't have to have a yard to enjoy beautiful bulbs. I have plenty of pots on my Brooklyn terrace: big deep ones for tulips and alliums, underplanted with minor bulbs, and lots of little low ones for Iris reticulata and dogtooth violets.</p>
        <p>Other than giving you arthritic and low-back pain in the fall, bulbs are wonderfully low maintenance. Instead of ''Lara's Theme,'' I'm hearing ''Fall on your knees!''</p>
        <p>Digging for Bulbs, Before You Dig</p>
        <p>IN general, bulbs should be planted at a depth of about three times their height. Most appreciate fertile, well-drained soil.</p>
