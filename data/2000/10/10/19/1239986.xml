        <p>Amid the craziness of clinching a pennant, Mookie Wilson seemed an oasis of calm. While many of the Mets have waited years for a shot at the World Series, and New York has waited 44 years for a Subway Series, Wilson has seen the postseason at its most bizarre.</p>
        <p>Now the Mets' first-base coach, Wilson was at the center of the 1986 World Series. It was his ground ball that found its way under Boston first baseman Bill Buckner's glove in the 10th inning of Game 6. The Mets won that game and then won Game 7. But even though he has been there, Wilson is unsure whether he can impart to the current players a sense of what the coming World Series, a Subway Series, will be like.</p>

        <p>Amid the craziness of clinching a pennant, Mookie Wilson seemed an oasis of calm. While many of the Mets have waited years for a shot at the World Series, and New York has waited 44 years for a Subway Series, Wilson has seen the postseason at its most bizarre.</p>
        <p>Now the Mets' first-base coach, Wilson was at the center of the 1986 World Series. It was his ground ball that found its way under Boston first baseman Bill Buckner's glove in the 10th inning of Game 6. The Mets won that game and then won Game 7. But even though he has been there, Wilson is unsure whether he can impart to the current players a sense of what the coming World Series, a Subway Series, will be like.</p>
        <p>''I've thought about '86 every day since I've been here,'' Wilson said yesterday in a locker room that still smelled of Champagne. ''But '86 cannot prepare you for what's going to happen in the next couple of days. I think it's totally different. Sure we played the Yankees in midseason, and yeah, that was a little subway series. But all that was just to pacify the fans. This is for the ball of wax. This is a little different.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''There was no greater World Series than the '86 World Series. But, of course, this one hasn't taken place yet.''</p>
        <p>Wilson said that few of the current players had sought his advice but that catcher Mike Piazza had inquired more than once about 1986.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to know, now that I've been through some emotional games myself, what it was like,'' Piazza said.</p>
        <p>Piazza said Wilson told him that an hour after Game 6, there were players in the trainer's room still asking, ''What happened?''</p>
        <p>''It was hysteria,'' Piazza said. ''I can't imagine. It was a historic moment.</p>
        <p>''I just hope we have that magic. Obviously, they had some sort of -- I don't know what you want to call it --  some strange energy or magic working for them, because of certain things that happened in that series. Mookie is here, so we think some of it has rubbed off.''</p>
        <p>Keeping It Secret</p>
        <p>While Mets Manager Bobby Valentine says he has decided on a probable starting rotation and roster for the World Series, he will not announce his decisions until he has to: 10 a.m. Saturday, the day of Game 1.</p>
        <p>''Have the Yankees announced theirs yet?'' he asked playfully. ''I'll follow their lead.''</p>
        <p>But Mike Hampton, who threw 16 shutout innings and was named the National League Championship Series most valuable player, said he thought he would probably start in Game 1. Al Leiter would be the logical choice to start Game 2.</p>
        <p>''I think they're kind of leaning that way, so I can get a chance to bat in the fifth game, as opposed to having Al hit,'' Hampton said. ''I'm a better hitter now, basically. That'd be the obvious choice. But whenever I get the ball is fine.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' only roster decision, General Manager Steve Phillips said Tuesday, was whether to add an 11th pitcher, possibly Pat Mahomes, or to keep the roster as it was for the National League Championship Series. Valentine said that four scheduled games in Yankee Stadium, where the designated hitter will be used, would not change his thinking.</p>
