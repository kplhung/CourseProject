        <p>China's spidermen, its legion of low-tech window washers, may not be super heroes, but they are nearly superhuman in what they are willing to risk for $4 a day.

        <p>China's spidermen, its legion of low-tech window washers, may not be super heroes, but they are nearly superhuman in what they are willing to risk for $4 a day. Suspended from single, thumb-thick ropes, they hang like spiders hundreds of feet in the air, cleaning this country's high-rise windows.</p>
        <p>''It's scariest when there's a wind,'' said Yang Ershun, peering up at four colleagues dangling outside the 27th floor of the Sofitel hotel's 34-story tower in downtown Shanghai. His job is to hang on to the ropes at the bottom to keep his co-workers from bouncing off one another like wind chimes.</p>
        <p>Until fairly recently, window washers in China were earthbound. Horizontal post-and-beam architecture kept windows close to the ground, and many windows were paper, not glass, in any case.</p>
        <p>But the advent of the skyscraper, particularly the glass curtain type adopted from the West in the past decade, has wrapped China's cities in acres of vertical glass that need the periodic squeak of a squeegee. Cable-suspended gondolas like those used by high-rise window washers in the West are too expensive for most Chinese building owners. But cheap, daring laborers are easy to find. So a growing number of men make their living here by climbing over lofty precipices and into thin air with buckets of soapy water in hand.</p>
        <p>Lean and leathery Zhai Xiang yang, taking a break from the facade of Shanghai's New World Department Store, said his ''heart was terrified'' the first time he stepped off the edge of a tall building. His palms sweated and his head spun, though he is accustomed to the vertigo now. ''To make a living,'' he said, ''I don't have a choice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yang, too, takes his turn in the wind, sitting on a pine board seat secured by his own weight pulling on a horseshoe bolt that cinches the rope like a rappelling mountaineer's descender. Window washers usually hang a red plastic bucket beneath them and carry a squeegee on a pole. Some carry a suction cup on a string, which they use to anchor themselves to the window.</p>
        <p>Tales of equipment failures are tall but true in this business. The most gruesome involve men who ignore government regulations and do not attach themselves to a backup line. Their ropes occasionally snap from overuse and the corrosive effects of window-washing detergent.</p>
        <p>''One of my co-workers fell from several stories up a couple of years ago,'' recalled Ji Shengjun, 28, a tall man with a mop of black hair who has survived 10 years in the business. ''He's a vegetable now.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Ji could be seen recently swinging, without a backup, down the side of a seven-story pile in Shanghai, even stepping on high-voltage electric lines running beside the building. ''They're insulated,'' he replied confidently when asked later if the wires posed a danger. He added that he used a backup rope if he was working really high.</p>
        <p>No one keeps track of how many men die to keep China's windows sparkling, though window washers in Shanghai say they hear of several rope breaks a year. Accident insurance is a luxury afforded by only the best companies, and liability lawsuits on behalf of poor, uneducated victims are rare.</p>
        <p>Even the backup rope doesn't help much unless a rope breaks very high above the ground. Window washers are attached to the rope by a short safety line and a ratchet, which is too weak to stop the dead weight of a falling man until he has already plunged 100 feet or more.</p>
        <p>A friend of Mr. Yang's who dropped from the 30th floor when his rope broke a few years ago found himself dangling outside the fourth floor by the time the screaming ratchet on his backup rope caught and stopped his fall.</p>
        <p>People like Mr. Yang and Mr. Ji are generally hired on the spot, with little training. ''We take them to a high building to check if they are afraid,'' said Chen Renliang, who fields about 40 rope-hangers a day. He added that only about one in 100 job candidates were turned away. ''Basically people who come looking for this job are willing to do it.''</p>
        <p>Most are young men from China's impoverished countryside who hear about the high-flying work from fellow villagers already in the city. So window-washing teams often hail from the same village and banter aloft in their local patois or sing hometown folk songs above the bustle of the city.</p>
        <p>For risking his life, the average spiderman makes about $100 a month, depending on how much glass he cleans. Prices -- and wages -- are falling as competition increases. Less than a decade ago, window-washing companies in Shanghai charged as much as 35 cents per square meter cleaned. Now they charge 12 cents.</p>
        <p>Spidermen can be seen dangling all over China's cities on single strands of three-ply rope, sometimes wearing plastic bags on their feet to keep from scuffing up their work. Earlier this month, they were suspended over the front of China's Central Military Commission headquarters in Beijing. And in Shanghai, more than 1,000 companies hang men out to wash, though only a handful of these workers are relatively well equipped and use backup ropes religiously.</p>
        <p>Most ropes are hemp-and-nylon blends. They can be as long as 850 feet -- buildings taller than that are generally fitted with window-washing gondolas. To prevent chafing where the rope rubs against the rooftop edge, the window washer puts a pillow or bit of carpet under it. A rope usually lasts about a year, though some are dangerously weak after eight months if they have been heavily used.</p>
        <p>The risk, then, grows as the window-washing season wears on. To keep his fear in check, Mr. Ji says, he looks at the windows, not the ground, though he is thankful when he reaches the end of his rope each day.</p>
