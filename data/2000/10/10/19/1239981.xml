        <p>Disregarding a plea by the United Nations secretary general, the Palestinians carried their bitter confrontation with Israel into a special session of the General Assembly today. They accused the Israelis of unleashing ''savagery and brutality'' in the last few weeks in a ''deadly campaign of repression'' against the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The unrestrained accusations leveled by the permanent Palestinian observer to the United Nations, Nasser al-Kidwa, prompted an angry rebuttal from the Israeli ambassador, Yehuda Lancry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancry said that today's session, which the Palestinians requested, violated the spirit of their agreement a day earlier at Sharm el Sheik and could disrupt efforts to halt the violence in the Middle East. And the session itself, he said, was a ''disgraceful abuse'' of the General Assembly's rules of procedure.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, diplomats said, France pressed the Palestinians to accept a weaker version of a draft resolution they are circulating, which condemns ''acts of violence and excessive use of force'' by Israel. Other West Europeans asked the French, who hold the rotating presidency of the European Union, to minimize the damage that the Palestinian resolution might cause.</p>
        <p>The United States ambassador, Richard C. Holbrooke, vigorously worked the hall to derail or delay the Palestinian resolution, lobbying one delegation chief after another to oppose it, or at least to abstain in the interest of preserving the fragile agreement to seek a truce that President Clinton brokered between Israel and the Palestinians during a day-and-a-half summit meeting in Egypt.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. will oppose any resolution that isn't completely balanced and objective,'' Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview, adding that, ''In such a climate, such a resolution seems virtually inconceivable.''</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan, who returned to New York today from Paris after joining the talks at Sharm el Sheik, arranged to address the General Assembly on Friday before the debate resumes.</p>
        <p>Apparently at his behest, speakers today were limited to the Palestinian observer and the representatives of Israel, Senegal and South Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan told reporters on Monday before leaving Sharm el Sheik, ''We have to watch the language we use if we are going to calm down the situation.'' In an earlier statement, he appealed to ''all Israelis and Palestinians, and to the wider international community, to weigh their words carefully.''</p>
        <p>''For words can inflame or soothe,'' he said, ''and everyone needs a restoration of calm and quiet so as to create the best possible atmosphere for a resumption of peace talks.''</p>
        <p>Diplomats and United Nations officials here agreed that Mr. Annan meant to include the General Assembly session.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kidwa, who speaks with authority as a nephew of the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, seemed unrestrained in his remarks. ''In response to the Palestinian protests,'' he said, ''Israel, the occupying power, has used its huge war machine to launch a bloody campaign of repression against our people, including a number of willful killings, including several children, and willfully causing numerous serious injuries and great pain for the civilians.''</p>
        <p>Over the last few weeks, Mr. Kidwa added, Israel had killed more than 90 Palestinians and injured more than 3,000. One-third of the casualties, he said, were ''children under the age of 18.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli ambassador called Palestinian assertions of excessive force completely unfounded. ''There is no nation on earth that would tolerate such life-threatening attacks against its citizens and not respond in kind,'' Mr. Lancry said.</p>
        <p>He referred to the lynching of two Israeli soldiers at a Palestinian police station last Thursday. ''That this unspeakable act could have taken place inside an official building of the Palestinian Authority only contributes to the degradation of mutual trust and confidence that we have worked for so many years to establish,'' Mr. Lancry said.</p>
        <p>Yet there were signs that the Palestinians, in what has become a familiar exercise in assailing Israel at the General Assembly, have found some nations weighing their longstanding support against Mr. Annan's call to lower the decibel level.</p>
        <p>Senegal's ambassador, Ibra Deguene Ka, speaking as chairman of the United Nations' Committee for the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, echoed many of the charges voiced by Mr. Kidwa, but also called the agreement reached at Sharm el Sheik ''perhaps the last chance for the world to get parties to engage in dialogue and reconciliation.''</p>
        <p>The South African ambassador, Dumisani S. Kumalo, speaking on behalf of the movement of nonaligned nations, which has traditionally supported the Palestinians, said the movement ''pledges full support to the present efforts of the U.N. secretary general in the quest for peace.''</p>
        <p>By opposing the Palestinian resolution, Mr. Holbrooke said, the United States was trying to protect the United Nations' ability to play a role in bringing Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>''We firmly believe the best resolution is no resolution,'' he said.</p>
