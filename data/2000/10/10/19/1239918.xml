        <p>CONSIDERING that cafes in Italian train stations routinely achieve espresso perfection hundreds of times a day, producing a satisfying cup in the United States seems far more difficult than it ought to be. Fine restaurants routinely botch the operation, while efforts at home, particularly with those inexpensive stove-top pots, range from murky water to mud.</p>
        <p>For frustrated espresso drinkers, the new Alessi machine offers a nearly idiot-proof solution. Using Nespresso capsules filled with premeasured and preground coffee beans in eight blends, it produces fine cups of espresso, complete with a desirably thick layer of crema, or foam, on top. The espresso is rich and aromatic, and though the flavor is not as intense as it would be with fresh ground beans, it is nonetheless satisfying.</p>
