        <p>Broadwing Inc., the fast-growing communications carrier that evolved from the old Cincinnati Bell, intends to announce quarterly financial results today that will modestly exceed analysts' expectations. Officials said Broadwing, which focuses on digital services, would report a loss of 19 cents a share, excluding special items, while Wall Street was expecting a loss of 20 cents a share. Other results will also exceed expectations. For example, Merrill Lynch has forecast that the company will post Internet and data services revenue of $250 million, but the data revenue will be $264 million.</p>
