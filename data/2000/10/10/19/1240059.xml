        <p>Reversing themselves, Nassau County's Republican lawmakers said today that a property tax increase was necessary to help bring the county's troubled finances into balance next year. But their proposal for a 5 percent rise in the county portion of local property tax bills fell well short of the 16.3 percent being sought by Democratic legislators.</p>
        <p>The two camps in the County Legislature, who for weeks have been lacing into the budget plans of the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, today released separate sets of plans that each has submitted to the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state board that is overseeing the county's efforts to balance its budget through 2004.</p>
        <p>The Democrats who control the legislature had planned to pass their 2001 budget and a fiscal plan for the following three years on Thursday. But tonight, the Democratic leader in the legislature, Judith A. Jacobs, agreed to postpone that vote until Oct. 26 at the request of the state board's chairman, Frank G. Zarb.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with Mr. Zarb tonight, she, Mr. Gulotta and Peter J. Schmitt, the leader of the Republican lawmakers, also agreed to try to reconcile the huge differences among their three competing plans.</p>
        <p>''We have agreed that this time will be used as a time of opportunity to see if a better consensus can be built among all parties,'' Ms. Jacobs said.</p>
        <p>Over several weeks of wrangling with Nassau's fiscal crisis, the county leaders have met only once -- just the three of them -- to negotiate the budget.</p>
        <p>''You can't resolve differences unless you talk,'' Richard M. Kessel, a member of the state board, said after the hourlong phone call. ''And we are delighted that Judy, Peter and Tom are going to sit down and talk and, if nothing else, understand each other's proposals and exchange ideas.''</p>
        <p>For weeks, Mr. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader, has said that Nassau residents cannot afford any increase in property taxes, especially with school taxes rising so fast. But today, he called for a 5 percent increase in county property taxes that support the Police Department.</p>
        <p>''If this was to pass the legislature, it is $44 and some change on the average household,'' Mr. Schmitt said of his plan. ''It's businesslike; it's common sense.''</p>
        <p>His words brought him somewhat in line with Ms. Jacobs: Both now agree that raising taxes is inevitable to right the county's sinking fiscal ship and to keep the oversight board from seizing broad financial powers from elected officials.</p>
        <p>The Democrats do not need Republicans' support to pass a budget -- they have a 10-to-9 majority in the legislature -- but they will need Republican votes for an override if Mr. Gulotta vetoes any part of their plan.</p>
        <p>The plan the Republicans submitted today says that Mr. Gulotta's 2001 budget includes more than $80 million worth of spending cuts and new revenues that may not materialize. But that figure has been lowered to $45.5 million after talks between the Democrats, the state board and Mr. Gulotta.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, both sides in the legislature agreed to reject Mr. Gulotta's plans to lay off more than 300 unionized workers, and his proposed 22 percent pay raises for county police officers and detectives over the next five years. They agreed that Mr. Gulotta's proposal for a 3.8 percent increase next year in the county's share of the property tax, which makes up just 19 percent of the overall property tax bill, was too small.</p>
        <p>The Democrats said their proposed tax increase, which would add $165 to the average household's yearly tax bill, would provide enough money to keep some essential social service and other programs financed, to set up a $13 million reserve fund for fiscal emergencies and to ensure a nearly $20 million surplus next year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said the Republican proposal included many ideas that the two sides had been discussing over the past weeks and that had already been included in the Democrats' $2.23 billion budget, slightly higher than the $2.21 billion proposal submitted by Mr. Gulotta.</p>
        <p>But she criticized Mr. Schmitt, saying that while he had expressed concern over some spending cuts proposed by Mr. Gulotta, his plan did not call for restoring that money.</p>
        <p>In their budget plans for 2002 through 2004, the Democrats agree with Mr. Gulotta's proposal to stop paying $50 million a year in aid to the county's three towns and two cities. But they would cut off those funds in 2004, rather than 2003, as Mr. Gulotta had suggested, to allow local lawmakers time to lobby state lawmakers to pass enabling legislation.</p>
        <p>The Democrats approved Mr. Gulotta's idea to save $7 million, in 2004, by forcing county school districts to repay their share of refunds to taxpayers who successfully challenge the county's antiquated property tax assessment system. Their rationale, they said, was that in the future the payments would be much lower because the property tax system is being overhauled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta had proposed cutting the county subsidy to Long Island Bus in half next year, to $7 million from $14 million, but the Democrats proposed cutting the subsidy only to $11 million. In 2002, they would reduce it to $7 million and said they would not lower it further, as Mr. Gulotta and Mr. Schmitt suggested, until the state offered assurances that it would pay the remainder.</p>
        <p>After a preliminary review of the Democratic plan, H. Carl McCall, the Democratic state comptroller, said today that it appeared sound and detailed. Of course, he said, the size of any tax increases will be debated, as they should. But the budget is a good first step, he said.</p>
        <p>''It eliminates the kind of gimmicks that have riddled the process in the past,'' he said. ''It really says to the public, 'This is what you will get and this is what you will have to give in order to have a sound financial plan.' ''</p>
