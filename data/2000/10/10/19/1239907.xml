        <p>WHILE television's purveyors tout the value of reality shows, pristine digital transmissions and interactive programming, television's ancestor, radio, remains mired in program formats and static-prone transmission standards that have improved little in the past 50 years.</p>
        <p>But all of that is about to change. Sometime next year, two start-up companies will offer the nation's first satellite radio services -- digital programming that will be available by subscription for car and home receivers. Unlike local AM and FM channels, these new 100-channel packages will be able to be heard continuously from one end of the country to  the other, with a CD-quality signal that the companies contend will be clearly heard even in the canyons of Wall Street or the mountains of California.</p>
        <p>If the business succeeds, and a number of industry observers say it will, it could mean a big shift in the radio world. Narrow-format digital shows, mostly free of commercials, will go head to head with the advertiser-laden talk and pop-music channels on AM and FM radio. In fact, digital satellite radio could presage the biggest change in broadcast radio offerings since the advent of FM in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Cable television succeeded because it offered viewers, for a monthly fee, narrowly focused channels for a wide range of tastes. Two companies -- XM Satellite Radio, in Washington, and Sirius Satellite Radio, in New York City -- plan to do the same thing. For example, one particular type of music will be available on several different channels, each with a slightly different emphasis. Talk formats will mirror cable's, with separate channels for business, current affairs, weather and even auto racing.</p>
        <p>Just as cable has expanded into ancillary services like local phone service and video on demand, so, too, do Sirius and XM expect their audio services to be only the first step in a plan to offer, for additional fees, in-car services like e-mail and e-commerce access, and data delivery.</p>
        <p>''Cable started out as a television service, and now, with pay-per-view and high-speed modems, it's a pipe into the home,'' said Hugh Panero, president of XM. ''We want digital radio to be that pipe into the car.''</p>
        <p>But a basic question is yet to be answered: Will people pay $9.95 a month for something they are used to getting free? Both companies say a lot of people will.</p>
        <p>In a study financed by Sirius, 10 percent to 30 percent of automobile owners indicated that they would probably subscribe to a digital satellite radio service in the next two to three years, according to Michael Reid, a Paragon Research senior vice president who conducted the study.</p>
        <p>With 200 million cars on the road and 4 million more added each year, just a 1 percent subscription rate for all cars would  mean $250 million in revenue for digital radio.</p>
        <p>In another study, the Yankee Group found that 21 percent of consumers did not like today's radio offerings. Many of the dissatisfied listeners complained about a large number of commercials and a lack of programming variety, said a senior analyst, Michael Goodman. The digital radio companies hope that their programming will attract such subscribers.</p>
        <p>''Improved sound quality alone would not have been enough for digital satellite radio to succeed,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''People don't buy satellite television just for improved reception, and they won't buy satellite radio solely for better sound.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if digital satellite radio fails to take off, the number of businesses that feel the loss will be small. That is because XM and Sirius are the only ones authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to get into the business. Both will broadcast in the same ''S band'' two-gigahertz spectrum space, both will offer about 100 channels of programming, and both have created alliances with major automobile manufacturers to offer digital satellite radios in new cars next year.</p>
        <p>XM, which expects to begin broadcasts next May or June, will be available in General Motors cars and trucks. Sirius, which says it will begin broadcasting in January, has agreements with BMW, DaimlerChrysler and Ford (including Volvo and Jaguar), and Freightliner and Sterling trucks. Starting sometime next year, some 2001 model-year cars, including a Cadillac model, will be available with satellite radios, which will also be able to receive AM and FM stations, and more will be added in following years.</p>
        <p>At first, satellite radios for cars will be offered in expensive models. Satellite radio units, and add-on modules for older cars, will be manufactured by all the leading radio providers, including Pioneer, Alpine,  Sharp and Sony.</p>
        <p>To pick up the digital radio signal, each car will be equipped with a stubby antenna, which will stick up from the rear windshield. A few inches tall, the antenna resembles a tiny fist with an upraised thumb.</p>
        <p>''Between Sirius and XM,'' said Hugh Panero, president of XM, ''we're offering our service to 75 percent of the automobile business, and every radio manufacturer will make satellite radio receivers.''</p>
        <p>Sirius has raised $1.5 billion and XM $1.1 billion to build and launch the necessary satellites, to construct large digital recording and transmission centers, and to program hundreds of channels of music and informational programming.</p>
        <p>Learning a lesson from the American cell phone industry, which has fallen far behind Europe in cellular technology because of the lack of a single transmission standard, XM and Sirius have decided to sue for peace before any war has started. In February, they agreed to develop a unit that will be able to receive both services, but this unified receiver will not be available for two to three years.</p>
        <p>Until then, purchasers of new cars will be able to subscribe to only the digital radio service offered by their cars' manufacturers. To encourage people to try satellite radio, car makers will most likely fold the cost of the radio and the first year's subscription fee, $9.95 per month, into the purchase price of the car.</p>
        <p>The service is being earmarked for automobiles because that is where the money is. ''Radio is to the car what TV is to the home,'' Mr. Panero said.</p>
        <p>Still, home receivers will be available. Sirius will not even bother charging for home service if a customer has a car subscription. XM has not decided what to charge for home subscriptions, although it expects that some type of discount will apply for those who subscribe in their car, a company spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Both companies will offer a wide range of narrow-interest music channels. Sirius plans to include five jazz channels, three classical, eight Latin and seven rock. XM will have a similar mix.</p>
        <p>Among the news, sports and entertainment channels signed up by one service or the other, or by both, are the BBC World Service, Nascar programming, comedy channels, Bloomberg News, National Public Radio and CNBC. Sirius will keep all its music channels free of commercials, and it expects to have a maximum of 10 minutes of commercials per hour on its other channels. XM will have up to six minutes of commercials per hour with some of its programming, which could include some of the music channels.</p>
        <p>A radio smorgasbord of music channels is  already offered by some cable and satellite television providers. But unlike those home-based digital satellite radio services, both XM and Sirius will provide on-air hosts and do their own packaging of material, along with some original programming.</p>
        <p>In fact, the services will be so similar,  said Sirius's chairman, David Margolese, ''the only thing that will distinguish them is brand differentiation.''</p>
        <p>Sirius's transmission center, at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, includes 76 studios spread across more than 50,000 square feet, with some large enough to accommodate an  entire orchestra.</p>
        <p>All XM and Sirius programming will remain solely in a digital format, from the  time it is recorded until it is received by the car unit. At Sirius, programming is stored on a 4-terabyte (4,000-gigabyte) disk farm capable of holding 15,000 hours of music, or about two million pieces of music, in compressed form.</p>
        <p>The company will even use computers to help its programmers make musical selections. Keywords describing various musical selections will be entered into a computer database so D.J.'s can search for particular kinds of music.</p>
        <p>XM has built 82 studios in its 60,000-square-foot production complex in Washington. And other recording studios in New York, Los Angeles and Nashville will be able to deliver programming via a T-1 digital link to Washington.</p>
        <p>XM's audio files are stored on one of eight I.B.M. Netfinity servers, which offer a total of 21 terabytes of storage. Traditional radio cables is not used; instead, fiber optic cables connect every control room to every workstation, digital mixer and audio router.</p>
        <p>''With 64 stereo inputs and outputs in each studio,'' said Tony Masiello, XM's vice president for operations, ''we'd need a multitude of regular wiring. One fiber optic cable takes the place of all of them.''</p>
        <p>As in Sirius's production studios, audio editing takes place on computer workstations. The editing software was developed in France. Programs are not recorded before transmission. Rather, the D.J. creates a show sequence, which at the time of transmission tells the server which file among the one million titles in the library should be retrieved, compressed (using Lucent Technology's PAC standard) and then sent,  along with the other selections, to the satellite.</p>
        <p>Sirius will be using three low-altitude satellites, two already up and one that is scheduled to be launched in November. At any time, two will be over North America.</p>
        <p>The signal will be relayed from one satellite and received by the radio, then decoded into analog mode and played after a four-second delay. If the signal is lost while the listener is traveling under a bridge or through a short tunnel, the radio can use its audio buffer, then can pick up the signal from the second satellite, which transmits the same signal as the first, but four seconds later. The signals can be seamlessly integrated so the listener will not hear a gap in the program.</p>
        <p>''With millions of moving receivers,'' said Mark Kalman, head of Sirius's national broadcast studio, ''we needed to ensure that our signal could be received even if a listener was driving near a high mountain or in a  canyon.''</p>
        <p>Still, it is possible that the terrain could be too difficult for any satellite signal to be received, as often happens on narrow Manhattan streets. To fill in coverage gaps, Sirius will have 100 terrestrial repeater stations placed throughout the country to relay the service to the car, and smaller repeaters at major tunnels.</p>
        <p>XM will fly two satellites in geostationary orbits so they will be available to North America at all times. The company will also have a network of repeaters, and it will employ similar technology to accommodate brief coverage lapses. Its satellites are scheduled to be launched in November and January. The company says its network of repeaters and greater satellite signal strength will make it possible for subscribers to receive the signal at all times.</p>
        <p>Music and talk offerings are only the first services that Sirius and XM expect to offer. As a digital conduit into the car, satellite radio service can go on to transmit any type of data, not just audio programming.</p>
        <p>Initially, each satellite-equipped digital radio will display the name of the artist and the song title on the unit's face. Both companies expect next-generation radios to mine the data services business. Hear an advertisement for an interesting product? Push a button on the radio and it could be immediately ordered. A back-channel signal sent via a cell phone link would instruct the service to ship the goods and charge the customer's credit card.</p>
        <p>In-car satellite navigation systems may no longer need to rely on DVD disks to update navigational information. With digital radio, the latest data could be downloaded directly through the service's digital stream for display on the navigation monitor.</p>
        <p>Ford has been allocated several Sirius channels for its own use and may offer various fee-based data services. One thing it could do would be to unlock car doors when owners lock themselves out. Other channels could be used to create personalized news, weather and sports offerings for each subscriber.</p>
        <p>One thing the services will not have, at least initially, is local weather, traffic or news. Still, local stations could view satellite radio as competition.</p>
        <p>''With the consumer able to get 100 additional radio channels, you could see weaker local stations drop out of the market,'' said Mr. Goodman, of the Yankee Group. ''Locals will have to become less cookie-cutter-like. They'll need to do something to bring their listenership back. Would CBS have created 'Survivor' if they didn't have competition from cable?''</p>
        <p>Clear Signals  AM and FM Stations Get Ready for Their Digital Leap</p>
        <p>NOT to be left behind, plain old advertiser-supported AM and FM radio will also begin the transition to digital in 2001, although the changeover from analog may go unnoticed by many listeners.</p>
        <p>This summer, two of the companies that were working to develop a transmission standard for digital AM and FM combined efforts to form the iBiquity Digital Corporation, owned by Lucent, Infinity Broadcasting, ABC, Bonneville International and other companies. IBiquity Digital expects the Federal Communications Commission to approve its system for digital transmission early next year, with digital terrestrial broadcast radio receivers available in stores by the end of 2001.</p>
        <p>With digital broadcast technology, AM radio will have the sound quality of today's FM radio, and FM will sound like a CD, said Bob Struble, iBiquity Digital's president. The proposed technology uses what is called the in-band, one-channel standard. Rather than employ additional spectrum space like digital TV, AM and FM stations can broadcast digitally on an unused part of their existing frequencies. To avoid the cliff effect, in which a digital channel either sounds perfect or, if the signal is too weak, disappears, the standard uses the existing analog transmission as a backup. Like its satellite digital radio competition, digital AM and FM stations expect to use digital technology as a Trojan horse, with local stations eventually offering various data services for monthly fees.</p>
        <p>''If the only thing digital broadcast radio offered was CD-quality FM,'' Mr. Struble said, ''that would be a tough sell to someone in a car traveling at 60 miles per hour. It's data that will be a new resource model for AM and FM radio.''</p>
