        <p>ACHUMAWI: there are 10 elderly speakers of this language left in northern California. Kiowa Apache: 18 speakers in western Oklahoma. Comanche: 854 speakers, most of them middle-age or older in western Oklahoma. Alawa: 17 to 20 fluent speakers in northern Australia. Manx: became extinct during the 1900's as a native language on the Isle of Man.</p>
        <p>These statistics, taken from the Web site for Ethnologue (www.sil .org/ethnologue), a reference work on the world's more than 6,000 oral languages, represent only a tiny fraction of those that are endangered, dying or dead. Language extinction is often the flip side of progress; as the world draws closer together, some regional differences fade to a distant, then a lost, memory.</p>
        <p>Some organizations equate the extinction of a language with the loss of a biological species, and they are trying to call attention to the need to record and preserve as many threatened tongues as possible.</p>
        <p>''As languages and the cultures they express continue to thrive, so do their relationship with the environment,'' said Luisa Maffi, the president of Terralingua, an international advocacy organization that supports research and education about linguistic and biological diversity (www.terralingua.org). ''If the environment is disrupted, people can no longer learn from it, and conversely if cultural change comes in and people adopt a different language, like a major language, and different cultural habits, the knowledge they developed about the environment may become irrelevant, and they may not care about the traditions the way they used to.''</p>
        <p>Terralingua has links to a vast array of language Web sites as well as a map showing the correlation between linguistic and biological diversity. It publishes a quarterly newsletter, Langscape.</p>
        <p>A simple-to-use but very extensive index is the Yamada Language Center site from the University of Oregon (babel.uoregon.edu/yamada /guides.html). It offers information or learning materials on about 115 languages, including Cherokee, Dakota, Gaelic, Hawaiian, Inuit, Iroquois, foreign sign languages -- and, for ''Star Trek'' fans, Ferengi and Klingon. (Yes, ''real'' vocabularies and grammars were created for them.)</p>
        <p>Many Web sites about endangered languages focus on the technicalities of linguistics, but relatively few have audio examples of the languages themselves. Two that do are www.ohwejagehka.com/index.html, which has sound clips of the Six Nations of the Iroquois, and www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gaelg/goo, a site with Manx sound clips. (Manx, like its extinct relative Cornish, is being learned anew as a second language.)</p>
        <p>At the Words and Images site (www.hollowear.com/gallery/word-image.html), Elly Sherman, an artist and poet, has had one of her poems translated into 80 languages. Two of them are playable on the site -- the versions in Saami, a language of northern Scandinavia, and Guarani, spoken in Paraguay and to a lesser extent in Brazil.</p>
        <p>The International Dialects of English Archive, an audio site run out of the University of Kansas (www .ukans.edu/idea), is an interesting site for training the student's ear, although it does not deal with rare languages. Created mainly for actors and other performers, it suggests an untapped possibility for rare languages on the Internet. Dozens of English speakers from around the world speak the same brief passage in their different accents. The Creolist Archives from the University of Stockholm (www.ling.su.se /creole/speech.html) has audio files of English, French and Portuguese creoles and pidgin tongues.</p>
        <p>The House of the Small Languages says it plans to serve as a collection of audio files of rare languages (www .burgaud.demon.nl/index.htm). A recent Language of the Week feature focused on Luiseno, a La Jolla Indian language of Southern California with about 43 speakers left, according to the 1990 census.</p>
        <p>Aboriginal Languages of Australia, a site sponsored by the University of Melbourne (www.dnathan.com /VL/austLang.htm), lists resources and background on Aboriginal Australian languages, many of them extremely rare. One audio link is a site on Jiwarli, a language of western Australia whose last native speaker, Jack Butler, died in 1986.</p>
        <p>Clicking on ''stories'' in the Jiwarli site, you can listen to three short talks by Mr. Butler: a mythological tale, a description about how hunters would kill an echidna and a reminiscence about an aged uncle.</p>
        <p>Another Aboriginal audio file has musical selections of Tjapukai (www .tjapukai.com.au/welcome.htm). On other sites in the Melbourne index, you can hear singing in Yindjibarndi and Yorta Yorta. And a selection from a CD of the band Yothu Yindi  presents some rousing Aboriginal rock (www.yothuyindi.com).</p>
