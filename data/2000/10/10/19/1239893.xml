        <p>The Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum has long offered Design Directions, free workshops for New York City public high school students. In the most recent session, which started last week, students are rethinking ''people movers,'' what most of us would call scooters and cars. Gary Natsume, a senior designer at Frogdesign, an industrial design company in SoHo, is teaching the course, which is called ''Make Stuff, Break Rules, Change the World.'' One student has already sketched a scooter like the one above, but with wheels all along it, like in-line skates. This session, which continues tonight and next Thursday, 3 to 6 p.m. at Frogdesign, 96 Spring Street, has four openings. The next workshop, ''Tag Your Threads,'' starts Nov. 14 and has 10 openings. Carlos Uribe, an artist, will teach students to design and print graphic images on T-shirts at the Harlem Textile Works. Information: (212) 849-8381.</p>
