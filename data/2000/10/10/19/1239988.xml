        <p>Players who have competed in both the Presidents Cup and the Ryder Cup have noticed at least one similarity. Winning makes the experience more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>So while the future direction of the Presidents Cup remains unclear, 24 of the world's best golfers insisted they were motivated and focused for the biennial competition that begins Thursday at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club. For the International team, the defending champion, this year's event is a chance to prove that its lopsided 20 1/2-11 1/2 victory over the United States in 1998 was not a fluke.</p>
        <p>For the Americans, there is a chance to avenge that defeat and an opportunity to ride the momentum created by last year's Ryder Cup, when the United States stormed back to win from a 10-6 deficit. The victory silenced the critics who questioned the ability of American players to bond in a team format.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to a Ryder Cup or a Presidents Cup where someone writes a story about how great a team we are, how much we pull together and how excited we are to go out there and try to beat the other team,'' said Jim Furyk of the United States team. ''I'm tired of hearing about how as Americans, we don't pull together, we're not a team and we don't care.''</p>
        <p>At the 1998 Presidents Cup in Melbourne, Australia, the International team played sensational golf, while the Americans looked uninspired and distracted, outplayed from start to finish. The Presidents Cup, started in 1994, lacks the tradition and prestige of the Ryder Cup, which began in 1927 and has evolved into one of the biggest events in sports.</p>
        <p>Motivation is never a problem at the Ryder Cup. But when asked to travel to Australia for the Presidents Cup in December 1998, during the official PGA Tour off-season, some American players performed as if they would have rather been elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''To hold that event halfway around the world at a time where nobody has touched a club for a month was very difficult,'' said Phil Mickelson, recalling 1998, the first victory for the International team in three attempts. ''We took a pretty sound beating. We just got pounded. They played great golf. We really didn't arrive ready for that type of play. We won the first two and I think we all expected we were going to win. They gave us a licking like no other.''</p>
        <p>Mickelson insisted that this year's team was more prepared, and there is evidence to support that view. Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1 player, is having perhaps the finest season in golf history, and the United States captain, Ken Venturi, will play Woods in five matches, the maximum number allowed in this format.</p>
        <p>''We're all excited about being here,'' said Woods, whose record was just 2-3 at the 1998 Presidents Cup. ''The last Presidents Cup, we were trying to take our break and get ready for the holidays. The timing wasn't the best. That's no excuse. We just didn't play well and they holed all the putts at the right time. This year, it will hopefully be different. We're right in the peak of our season. We're all playing pretty well.''</p>
        <p>But it remains to be seen how the Presidents Cup evolves from here. American players have complained about having to play either a Ryder Cup or a Presidents Cup every year. South Africa is being considered as the site for the next Presidents Cup in 2002, and if that location is chosen, what will happen to the prestige of the event if Woods or other top players elect not to go?</p>
        <p>''That's a really interesting question,'' said Mickelson, when asked if he would go to South Africa if the 2002 Presidents Cup were held there. ''I haven't had time to think about it as much as I would like. I've been putting that decision off.''</p>
        <p>While debate regarding the Presidents Cup's future will continue, the focus will be on golf from Thursday through Sunday. Sellout crowds of about 22,000 are expected all four days, and the drama of match play always produces unexpected shifts in momentum.</p>
        <p>The International team would love to win in the United States, to defeat a team that again includes Woods and to leave the American team with no excuses.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say it's a lame excuse, but we were all tired,'' said Nick Price of the International team, referring to the 1998 President's Cup. ''I think we adapted better than the U.S. team did.''</p>
        <p>Said Els: ''We couldn't help that the Americans weren't up to playing. If they didn't want to play, that was their prerogative. I was kind of in the same mood as the Americans. I didn't want to go. But when I got there and saw the team spirit we had, it lifted my game.''</p>
        <p>The Americans are hoping for that same kind of lift, playing at home, with a team that does not lack for talent. The United States team has seven players who were on last year's Ryder Cup team, and they enter the competition with confidence.</p>
        <p>''We're here, we're ready to play,'' Tom Lehman of the United States said. ''It would be great to have the Presidents Cup and the Ryder Cup trophies on American soil. I think that's what we're here to do.''</p>
