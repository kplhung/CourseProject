        <p>Stock prices fell further yesterday as a recovery from a steep early plunge was not enough to keep the Dow Jones industrial average, weighed down by I.B.M., from finishing below the 10,000 mark for the first time since March.</p>
        <p>Other major averages also lost ground. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite posted its 12th loss in the last 14 sessions, a period during which 16 percent of its value has vanished.</p>
        <p>Trading was heavy, especially during the early going, when the Dow skidded more than 435 points, or 4.3 percent, and the Nasdaq was down an even steeper 5.8 percent. Turnover on Nasdaq was 2.53 billion shares.</p>
        <p>''That first 15 minutes it was Katie bar the door,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief equity strategist at A.  G. Edwards in St. Louis. ''You could almost hear people saying, 'Get me out at any price.' ''</p>
        <p>But then, analysts said, the market solidified as investors appeared to re-evaluate Intel's third-quarter numbers and projections, which were issued after the market closed Tuesday, and they scooped up fallen technology stocks as presumed bargains.</p>
        <p>Prices bounded higher, aided by traders covering short positions, and the Nasdaq composite even nosed into positive territory before sagging again. It ended the day down 42.40 points, or 1.32 percent, at 3,171.56.</p>
        <p>''People began to realize the world wasn't coming to an end,'' said Matthew W. Johnson, head Nasdaq trader at Lehman Brothers. ''There were some bargains out there, and people took them back up.''</p>
        <p>The Dow industrials finished with a loss of 114.69 points, or 1.14 percent, at 9,975.02, its lowest close since March. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 7.84 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,342.13.</p>
        <p>I.B.M., whose third-quarter sales were short of expectations, dropped $17.56, to $95.44, to account for more than 90 percent of the Dow's loss.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan traded as low as $118 before rallying to close at $134.25, off $3.38. The stock appeared to suffer mainly from a decline in the earnings of Chase Manhattan, its proposed merger partner. Chase shares also largely pulled out of an early dive. They closed at $36.88, down $1.06.</p>
        <p>After the close, Microsoft announced higher-than-expected quarterly profits. It closed regular trading up $1.31, at $51.75, and climbed as high as $53.75 in late trading.</p>
        <p>But America Online, which gained $3.31, to $46.91, during regular trading, slumped as low as $38.50 after announcing its quarterly results.</p>
        <p>Even as the reporting season moved into full swing, other companies were still warning of disappointments. Copper Mountain Networks, for example, said it expected sales and profits to decline in the fourth quarter, and the stock plunged $17.03, to $9.84.</p>
        <p>Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.43 billion shares, the fourth-heaviest trading on record, as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 1,900 to 1,015 and new lows swamped new highs by 3,343 to 292.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Are Mixed</p>
        <p>By The Associated Press</p>
        <p>Bond prices were mixed yesterday, despite bad news about inflation and the decline in the stock market.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32, to 100 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.66 percent from 5.67 percent on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32, to 106 26/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.77 percent.</p>
