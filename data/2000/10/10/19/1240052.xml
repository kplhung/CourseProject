        <p>David Cone has been saying for a month that he was looking for one chance in the postseason, one opportunity to recoup his frustrating season, and he may well get it, if Manager Joe Torre picks the right-hander to start Game 4 of the World Series.</p>
        <p>Torre is expected to announce his pitching rotation today, and it's probable that Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez will start Games 1, 2 and 3. By setting his big three in this manner, Torre would use his most rested pitcher -- Pettitte -- in the opener, and ensure that Clemens will not pitch in Shea Stadium, where his at-bats would be a sideshow, because of Clemens's beaning of Mike Piazza on July 8.</p>

        <p>David Cone has been saying for a month that he was looking for one chance in the postseason, one opportunity to recoup his frustrating season, and he may well get it, if Manager Joe Torre picks the right-hander to start Game 4 of the World Series.</p>
        <p>Torre is expected to announce his pitching rotation today, and it's probable that Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez will start Games 1, 2 and 3. By setting his big three in this manner, Torre would use his most rested pitcher -- Pettitte -- in the opener, and ensure that Clemens will not pitch in Shea Stadium, where his at-bats would be a sideshow, because of Clemens's beaning of Mike Piazza on July 8.</p>
        <p>But Torre might pick Cone as his Game 4 starter, based on several factors.</p>
        <p>1. Denny Neagle, the starter in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series, seemed particularly passive in his approach, walking four, constantly working behind in the count until Torre relieved him with one out in the fifth inning. Neagle was the losing pitcher in both defeats to Seattle. If Neagle had pitched as well in Game 5 as he did in Game 1, then he would almost certainly be a lock as the Game 4 starter in the World Series. But Neagle struggled to throw strikes, and Torre has demonstrated little tolerance for that particular trait.</p>
        <p>2. Cone is coming off a year in which he went 4-14 with a 6.91 earned run average and dislocated his left shoulder in September, just as he seemed to be gathering himself. But Cone's shoulder has been feeling better, and in one inning of relief in Game 5 of the Seattle series, Cone threw strikes and retired all three batters he faced. Cone is right-handed and most of the Mets' lineup is right-handed, an advantage for Cone over Neagle, if Cone's slider is breaking well.</p>
        <p>3. Torre and Pitching Coach Mel Stottlemyre, who are making the decisions on the rotation, have deep trust in Cone and know his postseason history. Cone has made five starts in the World Series in his career and is 2-0 with a 2.15 E.R.A., allowing just 16 hits in 29 1/3 innings.</p>
        <p>Cone, a former member of the Mets, is 40-22 in Shea Stadium and might thrive on the stage of a Subway Series. Torre and Stottlemyre might not know how Cone's slider would move, or how much pop he has on his fastball. But they would know that Cone would not be afraid of the situation.</p>
        <p>Game 4 will be played next Wednesday, after an off day on Monday and Hernandez's probable start in Game 3 on Tuesday. Torre could operate under the assumption that his bullpen would be well rested, in case Cone floundered.</p>
        <p>There was a World Series pitcher in a similar situation to Cone's. In 1929, Philadelphia Manager Connie Mack shocked the baseball world by bypassing stars like Lefty Grove and George Earnshaw to pitch Game 1 of the World Series, picking 35-year-old Howard Ehmke, a favorite of Mack's who had thrown in only 11 games during the regular season. Ehmke beat the Cubs, 3-1, striking out 13, a single-game record that stood for 23 years.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch Oiling Glove</p>
        <p>Joe Torre has repeatedly said that he intends to start Chuck Knoblauch as his second baseman in Games 3, 4 and 5 at Shea Stadium, when the designated hitter won't be used. But Torre might put that plan into action in Games 1 or 2, too.</p>
        <p>Torre might want to get Knoblauch at least one start at second in the relatively friendly atmosphere of Yankee Stadium early in the Series, to get him reacquainted with second base; Knoblauch has not played there since Sept. 29. The left-handers Mike Hampton and Al Leiter will start for the Mets in Games 1 and 2, and Torre could start Knoblauch at second and one of his right-handed sluggers -- Glenallen Hill or Jose Canseco -- at designated hitter.</p>
        <p>O'Neill Scowls Over Shoulder</p>
        <p>After Paul O'Neill drove in three runs with a couple of hits in the clinching Game 6 on Tuesday, Torre saw him on the field. ''If I ever try to pinch-hit for you again, don't let me,'' Torre joked. Torre had used Glenallen Hill as a pinch-hitter for O'Neill in Game 5 in Seattle, a move that disappointed O'Neill.</p>
        <p>They Deserve Each Other</p>
        <p>Lou Piniella played and managed for years in New York, and knows something about what the Subway Series will do to the town. ''Baseball's always been special in this city,'' Piniella said. ''The Mets have their legion of fans, the Yankees have theirs. Now they can spill beer on each other.''</p>
