        <p>It is a sure sign that Election Day is around the corner when the big guns come out, and today the Bush campaign unleashed its silver-haired, pearl-draped howitzer. The former first lady, Barbara Bush, hit the trail, pressing her outsized and enduring popularity into the service of Gov. George W. Bush's aspirations.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush said voters should not expect this kind of effort too often.</p>
        <p>''I'm 75,'' she said at a news conference in Lansing, one of several stops on a bus trip across the breadth of southern Michigan. ''When you're 75, you're not running around town like you used to.''</p>
        <p>But when a son is running for president and the family pride is on the line, a woman does what she must, even if her methodical gait reflects her ongoing recovery from back surgery three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush said she would manage two to three days a week on the trail from now through Nov. 7, and officials with the Bush campaign said that President George Bush would also start popping up here and there.</p>
        <p>The former first lady's appearances today -- the first time that the Bush campaign had marketed her so aggressively -- dovetailed with a theme built around the middle initial in the Texas governor's name and an effort to bridge the gender gap.</p>
        <p>This was the ''W. Stands for Women'' tour, intended to reduce the Democrats' frequent advantage among female voters to the point where W. stands for something else: winner.</p>
        <p>The governor's wife, Laura Bush, was side by side with her mother-in-law. Michelle Engler, the wife of Gov. John Engler of Michigan, played tour guide. Condoleezza Rice, the Bush campaign's foreign policy adviser, and Lynne V. Cheney, the wife of Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, were also part of a morning rally in Grand Rapids, then took off in their own bus for their own events before reconnecting with the Bushes in Southfield tonight.</p>
        <p>The women embraced the issue of education. They danced cautiously around the issue of abortion.</p>
        <p>And they returned time and again to the issue of integrity, until one of Barbara Bush's principal purposes came into focus: She was out here to remind voters of an administration without the stain of sexual scandal and to vouch for the character of the Republican presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>''George W. must be the next president of the United States,'' she told the crowd in Grand Rapids, making it seem like a moral imperative.</p>
        <p>Today's show of feminine force reflected more than an appeal to women. It signaled the presidential campaign's transition into a final-stretch, make-or-break phase in which the packaging would get more fanciful, the strategies more inventive, the surrogates more numerous and their movements more frequent and rapid.</p>
        <p>The two Mrs. Bushes were due in the Philadelphia suburbs on Thursday morning. On Monday, the tour was scheduled to resume in Wisconsin without Barbara Bush but with Cindy McCain, the wife of Senator John McCain of Arizona.</p>
        <p>Barbara and Laura Bush seemed to be enjoying it, but then they were also still basking in evident satisfaction over Tuesday night's debate.</p>
        <p>In an interview on their bus, they made clear that they thought that Vice President Al Gore had gone several paces too far, especially when he moved to within a few inches of Mr. Bush to stare him down.</p>
        <p>''I thought he literally was going to hit him,'' Barbara Bush said, adding that her husband, who had watched the television broadcast with her, had exclaimed, ''My God!''</p>
        <p>They were not the only Bushes disturbed by Mr. Gore's stratagems. Laura Bush said that one of her twin 18-year-old daughters felt insulted by Mr. Gore's overt reference to his four children being at the debate. The Bush daughters, Barbara and Jenna, were not there.</p>
        <p>They have always maintained a careful distance from the campaign, to the occasional dismay of their father. But Laura Bush said the couple's daughters had tuned in to every debate, and she said that when Jenna, who is more difficult to impress, gave her father a rave review, he cried.</p>
        <p>Part of today's project was to talk about the softer side of the Texas governor, and the two Mrs. Bushes at times preferred that to policy.</p>
        <p>After fielding several questions about abortion, Barbara Bush interjected, ''Is there any other subject you're interested in?''</p>
        <p>The Texas governor opposes abortion in most cases, and that is one reason some moderate women are reluctant to vote for him.</p>
        <p>But Barbara Bush hinted that her son is no ideologue on the matter.</p>
        <p>''George has said he's not going to have a litmus test,'' Mrs. Bush said, referring to her son. ''By coincidence, neither did his father.''</p>
        <p>She went on to note that one of the two Supreme Court justices whom President Bush appointed, David H. Souter, turned out not to be so conservative after all.</p>
        <p>Laura Bush said there were issues above and beyond abortion that women cared about, a point she emphasized at news conferences. In Lansing, she said that her husband's proposals would help women care for elderly parents in need.</p>
        <p>Barbara Bush took mock offense, dramatically muttering, ''I'll never speak to her again!''</p>
        <p>It was a fleeting star turn on a day when, in some senses, the torch was being passed. Laura Bush got the featured speaking position and last word at joint rallies. She also conducted the news conferences.</p>
        <p>Not that Barbara Bush lacked for adoration. People lined the hallways or streets she walked, dazzled to be near her. Mrs. Cheney introduced her in Grand Rapids as ''the most admired woman in the entire United States.'' Mrs. Engler introduced her in Lansing as ''the greatest first lady of the United States so far.''</p>
        <p>She was also the fulcrum of the argument, implicit and explicit in much of what the women said today, that family values had gone missing from the White House over the last eight years, that ''honor and dignity'' needed to be returned.</p>
        <p>And she herself said that if her son and Mr. Cheney win on Nov. 7, ''Our country's going to be respected again.''</p>
        <p>In the days until then, she said, she will assiduously avoid anything that might cause her agitation or angst.</p>
        <p>''I don't read the papers,'' she said. ''I won't watch TV. I won't do any of that. But I will vote three or four times.''</p>
