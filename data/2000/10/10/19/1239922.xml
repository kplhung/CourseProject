        <p>JUSTIN JORGENSEN was visiting the office of a friend who works in the online pornography business last year, and he was appalled by what he saw. Mr. Jorgensen, 25, is not easily shocked, but there was something profoundly unsettling in the amateur photographs.</p>
        <p>Those drapes! That wall clock! The laundry on the bed!</p>
        <p>The naked guy in the foreground was one thing, but the stuffed marlin on the wall was scandalous.</p>
        <p>Because the transgressions were so shocking, and because he had a lot of time on his hands, Mr. Jorgensen, an interior designer, decided to do something about it. He created Obscene Interiors, a Web page that set its sights on what to him was the truly offensive side of the pornography world. Which is to say, the decor.</p>
        <p>Culling pictures from gay pornography sites, he electronically blotted  over the naked bodies to remove all taint of sexuality and called viewers' attention to the nasty bits: the clashing light switch plate, the stereo speaker used as a shelf, the pile of magazines splayed on the floor.</p>
        <p>The doctored photos may be in wildly bad taste, but they are not smutty, nor does the site provide links to any real pornography. In the one instance in which the silhouette was suggestive, Mr. Jorgensen altered the image digitally to remove the suggestion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jorgensen and another interior designer, who uses the name Kyle B. to avoid trouble at work, added snippy comments in the margins. Last December, Mr. Jorgensen put the results on his design-themed site on the Internet, Justinspace.com. The pictures get about 1,400 hits a day, he said.</p>
        <p>By its authors' lights, the site provides a critique whose time has come. To paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart's famous remark about obscenity, Mr. Jorgensen may not be able to define it, but he knows an obscene interior when he sees it.</p>
        <p>''If someone's going to go out to a nightclub or a party, they get all dolled up,'' said Mr. Jorgensen, who works as a designer for theme parks. ''Yet, here people are taking pictures of themselves in the nude and they don't bother even cleaning up a little or vacuuming.''</p>
        <p>Kyle B, who saw only the altered images, likened the results to photos from a ''crime scene, with a chalk outline'' where the body should be.</p>
        <p>The crimes are manifold. Mr. Jorgensen began compiling a list of recurring offenses. ''My biggest pet peeve is people putting lamps on top of speakers,'' he said. ''I don't know why this is happening all the time. It really concerns me.''</p>
        <p>The worst crimes, predictably, are those of ego. Just as amateur pornography subjects flaunt their bodies, flaws and all, they appear equally unself-conscious about their homes. ''It's like some sort of weird self-delusion that people are only going to look at them, and not pay attention to the trash on the floor behind them,'' Mr. Jorgensen said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jorgensen himself lives and works in a boxy, kitsch-filled apartment in Burbank, Calif., amid Ikea furnishings and housewares from Target's Michael Graves collection. In his work area, he has a stack of magazines on the floor and a pile of CD's on the speaker of his stereo. He is, in other words, but one digital alteration away from making it onto his own Web site. ''I know, I know,'' he said with a laugh. ''I think there's elements of all these interiors in almost everyone's home.''</p>
        <p>In her book ''Sex and Real Estate: Why We Love Houses'' Prof. Marjorie Garber of Harvard contends that housing has become ''a form of yuppie pornography,'' the new object of erotic desire. Obscene Interiors is a reminder that those basic desires, once exposed, can be nothing short of indecent.</p>
