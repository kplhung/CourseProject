        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re: ''E-Mail Gives Students More Choices for Career Advice'' (Oct. 12). Many rural high school students do not have access to calculus and other advanced math courses. As a result, they enter universities at a disadvantage. Hundreds of such rural students have been getting the mathematics courses they need through the NetMath program at the University of Illinois. In NetMath, each high school student has a personal Internet mentor, an Illinois undergraduate. The mentor guides the high school student through the math course via e-mail, telephone, Internet chat or Internet screen sharing.</p>
