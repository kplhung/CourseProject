        <p>About 40 doctors and nurses picketed outside the downtown offices of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts today in favor of a ballot initiative that would guarantee health care coverage to everyone in the state.</p>
        <p>Not exactly overwhelming? Neither is their campaign war chest. As of Oct. 1, the initiative's backers had reported raising $15,000. Their opponents, which include big insurers and health maintenance organizations, meanwhile, have raised more than $2 million and have projected a total budget of $4 million.</p>
        <p>But the doctors and nurses seem to be winning, at least according to early poll numbers. In a University of Massachusetts survey in late September, 72 percent of respondents supported the measure and 17 percent opposed it.</p>
        <p>It is the most lopsided of lopsided ballot fights, this battle over Question 5 in Massachusetts, and getting more interesting to watch. At issue is a ballot measure that would require universal health care coverage in the state by mid-2002, ban the conversion of hospitals to for-profit from nonprofit, require that no more than 10 percent of insurance premiums be spent on administrative costs and give patients the right to choose virtually all their doctors.</p>
        <p>In recent days, opponents of the measure have begun to broadcast television and radio advertisements several times a day, telling voters that Question 5 is poorly written and will destroy the health care system, raise premiums and attract health-care parasites from other states.</p>
        <p>An array of top medical establishment figures have come out against the measure, including deans of medical schools and heads of top hospitals. So have The Boston Herald and The Boston Globe. And many members of a coalition of unions and other groups that supported the initiative at first withdrew their support after the Legislature passed an extensive patients' bill of rights this summer.</p>
        <p>But the hard-core supporters have soldiered on, like the pickets today who accused Blue Cross and other health insurers and H.M.O.'s of squandering money to fight the referendum instead of spending it on patients. Proponents of the initiative have spent their meager money mainly on signs, bumper stickers and literature, the campaign director, Andre Guillemin, said. They have broadcast no advertisements.</p>
        <p>Normally in such fights, the money wins, said Louis C. DiNatale, director of UMass Poll, which ran the survey on the initiatives. But not always.</p>
        <p>In his analysis, ballot initiatives like Question 5 are known as ''70-percenters'' -- that is, they are written in such a way that 70 percent of average voters would support them. Opponents fight an uphill battle, but they can usually win if they have plenty of money and if the initial supporters have reneged.</p>
        <p>In this case, however, some of the initiative's supporters remain firm. And, Mr. DiNatale noted, health care is at the top of voters' agenda.</p>
        <p>''So part of the problem for the opponents of the initiative is that there does seem to be a high level of anxiety around health care questions, and this referendum seems to provide some kind of a security blanket,'' he said. ''If health care had not re-emerged as a No. 1 issue, this would be easier to defeat.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Allen, a spokesman for the ''No on 5'' campaign, said, ''We are confident that when the voters look at the facts -- and the facts are that this will put a wrecking ball to the health care system in Massachusetts, it will cost billions of dollars and create more red tape and bureaucracy -- that they will vote no on Question 5.''</p>
        <p>Still, the measure's opponents are taking few chances and have called in a California consulting firm with expertise in ballot measures.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the ballot measure say that Mr. Allen and his side are ''fearmongering'' and dispute their contentions that the initiative would cost billions and create more red tape. Rather, they say, it would cut the fat of H.M.O. marketing, return medical decision-making to doctors and relieve the uninsured.</p>
        <p>The sides on Question 5 are fighting not only over the referendum, but also over who is to blame for the money being spent trying to defeat it.</p>
        <p>Ann Eldridge, a registered nurse who marched today, castigated insurers for ''this obscene use of our health insurance dollars that they're spending now on TV ads to block this citizens' initiative.'' The money should be spent on patients, Ms. Eldridge and others argued.</p>
        <p>Insurance companies and H.M.O.'s are not the only opponents of the initiative, but several of them have spent several hundred thousand dollars each on the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen, the spokesman for the opposition, said, ''It would be everyone's preference that this not be on the ballot, but it is, and I think H.M.O.'s and business leaders and civic leaders have an obligation to get the facts out to the voters.''</p>
