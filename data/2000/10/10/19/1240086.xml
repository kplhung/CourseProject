        <p>BROOKLYN: POSSIBLE ANTI-SEMITIC VANDALISM  Since the Jewish holiday of Sukkot began last Friday, the police have reported seven cases of vandalism to sukkahs, the huts that Jews erect to commemorate the harvest festival. The police are referring the vandalism cases, all in Brooklyn, to the hate crimes task force. Yesterday, a 12-year-old boy was arrested on an arson charge in connection with fires set to two sukkahs on Balfour Place in Crown Heights on Friday, the police said. Both fires were extinguished. In the other cases, graffiti was spray-painted.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: DEFACER OF STATUES SENTENCED  A man who confessed to smashing and vandalizing religious statues in five Brooklyn churches has been sentenced to five years' probation, but the Brooklyn district attorney immediately protested. The Kings County district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said in a statement yesterday that he was ''profoundly disappointed'' in the sentence of the man, Primus St. Croix, 33. Earlier, Mr. St. Croix, pictured, had pleaded guilty and apologized for his actions. Mr. Hynes said that unlike federal prosecutors, he was unable to appeal the sentence.</p>

        <p>DOCTOR PLEADS GUILTY TO 1984 MURDER  A former doctor who pleaded guilty to killing three patients at a veterans hospital on Long Island admitted yesterday that he poisoned a woman at Ohio State University's hospital in 1984 while she was recovering from an auto  accident. Investigators believe the death of the woman, Cynthia Ann McGee, 19, began a string of poisonings in the United States and Zimbabwe by the former doctor, Michael Swango, who pleaded guilty in Franklin County Common Pleas Court in Ohio, to aggravated murder.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SUBWAY ASSAULT  A 16-year-old from Brooklyn was charged with robbery and weapons possession after he tried to push a man onto a Manhattan subway track while trying to rob him early yesterday, the police said. The police said the assault occurred after 1 a.m. at the East Broadway station of the F line, when the youth, Joseph Cochran, displayed what appeared to be a handgun and tried to rob the man.</p>

        <p>OCEANSIDE: LAUNDRY WORKERS STRIKE  More than 200 workers on Long Island went on strike yesterday at a  commercial laundry, Oceanside Institutional Industries, to demand higher wages, safer conditions and union recognition. The workers are demanding better protective equipment because their work involves hospital and nursing home linens often contaminated with blood and human waste.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: WOMAN KILLED BY BUS  A 64-year-old woman was struck and killed by a city bus as she tried to cross Main Street in Flushing last night, the police said. The woman, Tseng Lin, was crossing in the middle of the block near Sanford Avenue about 6:50 p.m. when the New York City Transit bus, heading north on Main, hit her, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. She died at New York Hospital, Queens, 40 minutes later, Detective Giammarino said. No charges were filed against the bus driver.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: ARSON CHARGES FILED  A Brooklyn teenager has been charged with arson in a stable fire that killed 21 horses. The teenager, Frank Esposito, 17, was charged yesterday with 57 counts including arson in the third and fourth degrees, reckless endangerment, criminal mischief, aggravated cruelty to animals and torturing animals, said Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the Kings County district attorney's office.

        <p>MANVILLE: V.F.W. IN DISPUTE  The local Veterans of Foreign Wars post mistakenly agreed to lend one of its rooms to a white supremacist group but then hurriedly barred the group Tuesday night. Post officials said a member of V.F.W. Post 2290, John Kucek, told them he wanted the room for an accounting seminar. But officials later learned the meeting was for a group called The Nationalist Movement, which staged a white power demonstration in Morristown on July 4. Officials canceled the meeting and locked the room. Mr. Kucek was not available for comment because he was hospitalized for chest pains.</p>

        <p>NORWALK: FIRST STATE CASE OF WEST NILE  State health officials have confirmed the first case of illness caused by West Nile virus in a human in Connecticut. A Norwalk woman, who was not immediately identified but whose age was over 50, tested positive after several days of headaches in August. She was not hospitalized.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: UNION PROTESTS  Hundreds of union members held a rally yesterday to urge Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital to develop a stronger partnership with their workers. The demonstration sought to pressure the university to grant union recognition to hundreds of graduate teaching assistants seeking collective bargaining rights. Yale officials say they are students, not employees, and therefore not allowed to organize. The demonstrators also called on the hospital, which is run by an administration separate from Yale, to stop fighting efforts to unionize 1,800 hospital workers.</p>
