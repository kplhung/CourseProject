        <p>Federal officials said today that Roger Carnahan, who was flying the plane in which he died along with his father, Gov. Mel Carnahan, and a political adviser, requested permission to change course to seek better weather moments before the plane crashed.</p>
        <p>The officials also confirmed that the pilot reported a problem with an instrument, a primary attitude indicator, which orients the pilot to the ground by displaying an artificial horizon.</p>

        <p>Federal officials said today that Roger Carnahan, who was flying the plane in which he died along with his father, Gov. Mel Carnahan, and a political adviser, requested permission to change course to seek better weather moments before the plane crashed.</p>
        <p>The officials also confirmed that the pilot reported a problem with an instrument, a primary attitude indicator, which orients the pilot to the ground by displaying an artificial horizon.</p>
        <p>Lauren Peduzzi, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board, said the younger Mr. Carnahan had radioed an air-traffic controller at 7:22 p.m. He reported having trouble with the instrument and requested permission to head west toward Jefferson City in search of better weather. At the time, the plane was flying in fog and heavy rain.</p>
        <p>The air-traffic controller told the pilot to head west, Ms. Peduzzi said. At 7:30 p.m., Mr. Carnahan acknowledged the instructions. That was the last contact with the pilot.</p>
        <p>In a continuing search today of the crash site about 25 miles south of St. Louis, officials said investigators had recovered part of an engine from the 1980 Cessna 335 that crashed Monday night, killing the three men.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in Jefferson City, Lt. Gov. Roger B. Wilson was sworn in as governor in a brief ceremony about 1:10 a.m. today, shortly after officials identified the remains found at the wooded crash site as those of Governor Carnahan.</p>
        <p>In one of his first official acts as governor, Mr. Wilson signed an executive order calling for a day of mourning across Missouri and closing state government offices on Friday, when services will be held for Governor Carnahan outside the capitol.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson, 52, had been lieutenant governor since 1992. A Democrat and former school teacher, he will serve out Gov. Carnahan's term, which ends Jan. 8.</p>
        <p>Mary Case, the Jefferson County medical examiner, said the remains of Governor Carnahan, 66, and his adviser, Chris Sifford, 37, had been identified through fingerprints. The medical examiner's office had not yet been able to identify Roger Carnahan, 44, Ms. Case said.</p>
        <p>About 100 investigators continued to comb the crash site today. Investigators recovered part of the plane's engine about a quarter-mile from the site.</p>
