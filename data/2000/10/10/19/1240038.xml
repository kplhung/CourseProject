        <p>The Xerox Corporation, which only days ago was fending off rumors of its impending bankruptcy, is talking to venture capitalists about selling its Palo Alto Research Center, which in the 1970's pioneered much of the technology for the personal computer industry.</p>
        <p>Struggling to raise cash as its sales and stock price plummet and its competitors grab shares of the copier market it once dominated, Xerox is also shopping around its financing arm and other assets, according to executives who have been approached by the company. The company is not close to completing any specific sale, they added, but even its  copier and printer businesses may not be sacrosanct.</p>
        <p>Xerox -- based in Stamford, Conn., and with 14,000 manufacturing employees in Rochester -- would neither confirm nor deny talk of asset sales. The company promises to lay out all its plans on Tuesday, when it announces the size of its third-quarter loss.</p>
        <p>Xerox's competitors in what is called the imaging business -- Kodak and Polaroid, along with names like Lexmark and Pitney Bowes -- are sharing its pain. The economy is softening, prompting consumers and businesses alike to put off buying new copiers, printers and cameras. Technology has created new competitors, with the likes of Sony selling digital cameras and Hewlett-Packard dominating the market for computer printers.</p>
        <p>But even against that backdrop, Xerox seems to be suffering most. Last week, when the company was unable to tap the commercial credit markets, it was forced to issue a statement after rumors circulated that it would seek bankruptcy court protection. Instead, it said it was relying on a $7 billion line of credit. While Xerox has refused to provide investors with more details, analysts and investors are estimating it is already using about $4 billion of that $7 billion to finance its short-term debt.</p>
        <p>While no one seriously predicts bankruptcy, investors, with little hard information to go on, remain anxious. ''What's driving the stock where it is today is fear,'' said David Giroux, an analyst with T. Rowe Price, a mutual fund company. ''They have not done a good job of allaying fears.''</p>
        <p>The stock has tumbled from nearly $64 in May 1999 to close yesterday at $6.75, a 10-year low.</p>
        <p>As a result, some investors are now calling for the board to make sweeping management changes.</p>
        <p>Others even suggest the board itself should turn over. ''Xerox's board has been sitting on its hands and needs fresh ideas from new-economy entrepreneurs,'' said Roger Kenny, a managing partner of Boardroom Consultants.</p>
        <p>Xerox may be forced to sell its half- share of Fuji Xerox, its Japanese printer and copier arm, to Fuji, some analysts suggest. And a few even contend that Xerox might bail out of copiers and printers altogether and turn itself into a ''solutions'' company, one that designs and runs document systems for companies.</p>
        <p>''The solutions approach at least lets them salvage cash and right the ship,'' said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst with PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>Several Silicon Valley venture capitalists say Xerox has begun talks with them about buying all or part of the Palo Alto Research Center, which is commonly known as Parc. An initial meeting with Accel Partners, a leading venture capital firm in Palo Alto, took place last week, according to several people close to the talks.</p>
        <p>Accel executives refused to comment on the negotiations but another venture capitalist at a firm that has talked with Xerox said that the Accel talks were serious but preliminary.</p>
        <p>No asset sale would be painless.  But the loss of Parc would be a blow to the psyche of Xerox as well as a strategic loss. Xerox did not turn  many of Parc's inventions into viable products, but Parc had various claims to fame: the computer mouse, the user-friendly icons that make personal computers so attractive to consumers and Ethernet, which links computers at remote sites.</p>
        <p>''Xerox would hate to part with them because they are the future,'' said Tom Long, a former Xerox executive who is now chief executive of Oce Printing Systems USA.</p>
        <p>Xerox may have little choice. ''Unless they can float more commercial paper or get additional capital that will cost them an arm and a leg in interest, they will have to sell assets to stay out of bankruptcy,'' Mr. Reitzes of PaineWebber said.</p>
        <p>Neither Xerox executives nor its directors are talking. Its senior management has been in continuous meetings at the Stamford headquarters, mapping out the strategy it will announce on Tuesday. ''The plan is in place, locked and loaded,'' said Jeffrey Simek, a Xerox spokesman.</p>
        <p>But what happened? How did this company, whose name was once a synonym for photocopier -- and Wall Street -- supremacy, fall so far? ''I don't know if I blame management, but the problem certainly isn't the people who are putting the machines together,'' said Gary Bonadonna, director of the Rochester joint board of the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which represents Xerox employees.</p>
        <p>For decades, Xerox all but owned the copier market. But over the last few years, the lines between printers and copiers have blurred. Moreover, the fastest-growing segment of the document processing world is low-priced printers and copiers for the small-office and home-office market, now dominated by Hewlett-Packard. Xerox has been late to get products to that market and to establish solid relationships with Staples, Comp USA and the other retail outlets.</p>
        <p>Xerox's direct sales force, once its greatest strength, has, meanwhile,  become its albatross. Xerox sales representatives had enviable relationships with the corporate purchasing agents who bought analog copiers. But information technology  executives and systems integrators put together the network systems in which modern copiers and printers play a part. Few of Xerox's sales people speak their language; most of Hewlett's sales people do.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Xerox hired G. Richard Thoman away from I.B.M. to reinvigorate the company. One of the first things he did was rejigger its sales territories, long organized by geography, around customer industries. He also consolidated many back-office operations, but instead of streamlining the company, the reorganization mostly produced chaos, with sales representatives trying to acquaint themselves with new accounts even as they field irate calls from old ones.</p>
        <p>Xerox also has become a bloated machine. It still maintains some departments organized around products, others around regions, others around industry groups. ''We had layered complexity into a structure that laid on costs, slowed decision making and masked responsibility,'' Mr. Simek, the Xerox spokesman, acknowledged.</p>
        <p>For a time, Xerox had some breathing space. Its most profitable product line, Docutech networkable copiers, so dominated the market for superhigh-speed machines that even would-be competitors talked about moving into ''the Docutech space.''</p>
        <p>But now Heidelberger Druckmaschinen of Germany, Canon of Japan, and most recently, I.B.M. are making deep inroads into the market with ''open architecture'' machines that can more easily accept electronic files from various software programs. And both Canon and Ricoh of Japan are cutting heavily into sales in the next-fastest machines.</p>
        <p>The lost market share also means fewer sales of lucrative service contracts and supplies like toner and ink cartridges. ''When they lose their installed base, they lose that entire annuity machine,'' said Brian Merriman, president of Danka Worldwide, Heidelberger's main distributor.</p>
        <p>In May, Xerox ousted Mr. Thoman. Paul A. Allaire, the former chief executive who had moved up to chairman, took back the chief's spot, and Anne M. Mulcahy, a 24-year Xerox employee, became the president and heir apparent.</p>
        <p>Xerox's competitors have taken advantage of the chaos. Ricoh, for one, has grabbed more than 14 percent of the copier market. ''Xerox has annoyed its customers and its employees, and that's giving us one of our best years ever,'' said Jim Ivy, president of Ricoh's Office Products Group.</p>
        <p>Customers are showing as little patience as investors. Many complain of neglect, arrogance and a willingness to negotiate prices only after a sale has been lost.</p>
        <p>''Xerox has lost the confidence of our technicians and management as a supplier for any equipment that would be attached to our network,'' said Michael Cushing, head of administration for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a longtime Xerox customer that could not persuade Xerox to help it hook new copiers into its network.</p>
        <p>Jamie Estes, president of Print Solutions, a commercial printer in Birmingham, Ala., had for many years paid Xerox a monthly fee to supply, maintain and operate its Docutech machines. Things went fine until June 1999, when the Xerox-supplied operator resigned. ''From then through October, they sent us 11 different operators, none of whom knew how to run the machine,'' Mr. Estes said. By last December, Mr. Estes had had enough -- he told Xerox to remove its machines, and bought a Heidelberger.</p>
        <p>Even customers that are sticking with Xerox are spreading the wealth around. Kinko's, Xerox's largest private-sector customer, spends more than $20 million a month on service and leasing fees for Xerox products, and just signed another two-year $290 million contract with Xerox for printers and services. Still, Kinko's has also contracted with I.B.M. for about 150 of its high-speed copiers. .</p>
        <p>Can Xerox, which has repeatedly disappointed investors and customers with promises to turn itself around, pick itself up?</p>
        <p>''I hope they still have one more comeback in their system,'' said William A. Johnson, Jr., the mayor of Rochester. ''But this is the direst, worst, most oppressive situation they've been in.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 21, 2000, Saturday  An article and an illustration in Business Day on Thursday tracing troubles at the Xerox Corporation misstated the role of the company's Palo Alto Research Center in developing the computer mouse.
