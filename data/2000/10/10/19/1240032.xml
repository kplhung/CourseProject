        <p>Linebacker Mo Lewis had been patient, not complaining about his reduced role on the Jets' defense. But last Sunday, he showed the Jets what they had been missing.</p>
        <p>Lewis was named the American Football Conference's defensive player of the week for his performance against New England: five tackles, one sack, an interception, a deflected pass that was picked off by Victor Green and returned for a touchdown and a 3-yard run on fourth-and-2 out of a fake field-goal formation.</p>
        <p>''I'm just a team guy,'' Lewis said today. ''Of course I've been disappointed I was on the sideline because I always want to be on the field.''</p>
        <p>Before today, Lewis had not spoken with the news media because he did not want to discuss his unsettled contract situation.  Lewis, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, was tagged as the team's franchise player in the off-season but contract talks broke down.  Lewis, who has been with the Jets his entire 10-year career, signed a one-year, $4.2 million contract, and he is most likely to leave after this season, replaced by John Abraham.</p>
        <p>But Lewis's performance Sunday is sure to help his market value. Lewis had not played in the nickel package this season because Coach Al Groh wanted to give him some rest and give Abraham an opportunity to establish himself. The reasoning was sound: although Lewis played in 95.2 percent of plays last season, according to Jets' records, most of his 38.5 regular-season sacks have come on first and second downs. But Groh said he had a gut feeling about putting Lewis back in on third downs and he played nearly every one last week.</p>
        <p>The result was immediate, even though Lewis said he was not in the flow of the game because it was his first time playing every down this season. On a third down early in the third quarter, Lewis sacked Drew Bledsoe for a 12-yard loss, forcing the Patriots to punt from deep in their own territory. Then, on a third-and-5 in the fourth quarter, Lewis intercepted a Bledsoe pass at New England's 36-yard line.</p>
        <p>Lewis did not lobby Groh to increase his playing time, and he will not say that he deserves to play every down against Miami Monday night, in what is sure to be a battle of stellar defenses.</p>
        <p>''You have to sit back, as a leader, you can't always be forceful,'' he said. ''You have to be humble. Being on the sideline is tough. When the game is over, you felt like it was a void, that you didn't really play a complete game. I missed it.''</p>
        <p>So did his teammates. They universally say that Lewis is the best player on the defense, and his absence on passing situations bewildered them as much as it did Lewis.</p>
        <p>''You wonder why,'' cornerback Marcus Coleman said. ''Eventually, the cream rises to the top. Everybody in this league knows Mo belongs out there.''</p>
        <p>Said Green: ''If we play 70 plays, he's got to be on the field for 70 plays. He can't be on for 30 plays, then you limit what he can do.''</p>
        <p>Lewis's adjustment period began with the arrival of Mike Nolan, the defensive coordinator who replaced Bill Belichick, and continued with his diminished role. But that period may be coming to an end. He is content with his role, and the whispers about the bumpy transition to Nolan's system have subsided.</p>
        <p>''When you go into a marriage, everything is new to you,'' Lewis said. ''When it's one way, and you felt it was the best relationship -- and I mean the relationship with Belichick -- and here comes a new person into your life, you're like: 'It's my way or the highway.' Being in a relationship, everybody has to learn how to compromise. It went both ways and it's working out pretty good.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>More fun with the injury report: center KEVIN MAWAE is listed as doubtful with a sore foot, but he insisted he was fine, and would practice on Wednesday, but he did not. ''I'm 100 percent going to play. I missed one practice in 11 years,'' Mawae said before practice. ''I haven't missed a game since I was a freshman in college.'' . . . But linebacker JOHN ABRAHAM, who is listed as questionable with a stomach muscle pull, did not practice and he seems less likely to play Monday. . . . Tight end ANTHONY BECHT (sprained knee) and running back BERNIE PARMALEE (hamstring) were both listed as questionable. Parmalee did not practice and Becht participated in individual drills.</p>
