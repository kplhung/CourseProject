        <p>When things were going badly for the Giants at the end of last season, Amani Toomer was doing well. And now, strangely enough during a 5-2 season, Toomer wonders why the good times stopped for him -- the Giants' No. 1 receiver.</p>
        <p>Well, perhaps they have not stopped.</p>
        <p>The Giants, who have a bye this week, resumed practice today for the first time since defeating the Cowboys by 19-14 on Sunday, and Toomer was back with the first unit. That is until an injury intervened.</p>
        <p>Before practice, Coach Jim Fassel spent time watching the receivers. He noticed the way Toomer warmed up, stretched and ran.</p>
        <p>''I was going to play him with the first unit,'' Fassel said today.</p>
        <p>But then Toomer's left hamstring began to bother him and Fassel decided to rest him.</p>
        <p>Toomer will probably not work out again until next week, when the Giants prepare for the Philadelphia Eagles. In any event, Toomer is back to starting.</p>
        <p>Toomer was yanked him out of the Sunday's game during the third quarter against the Cowboys. For Toomer, who contends the reason for the benching is a mystery to him, the move was quite a comedown. Last season he set a Giants record for receptions (79) and receiving yards (1,183). Along the way he averaged 15 yards a catch and scored 6 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>This season Toomer has crossed the goal line only once. He has 27 receptions and an average of only 10.6 yards a catch.</p>
        <p>''I can't throw the ball to myself,'' said Toomer, who sounded like the forgotten man.</p>
        <p>Of his decision to replace Toomer with Joe Jurevicius, Fassel said: ''We needed someone at a higher level. I don't play favorites.''</p>
        <p>Fassel said he had spoken to Toomer about getting back to the level he reached last season and avoiding the problems that plagued the receiver earlier in his career, such as dropped passes and missed routes.</p>
        <p>Fassel said he told Toomer: ''I'll do everything I can, but you made the change before. If you're going to get better, you'll have to do your part.''</p>
        <p>Against the Cowboys, Toomer was called for an offside penalty, dropped a ball that nearly was intercepted, and, Fassel said, ran a wrong route. (Toomer contends he slipped).</p>
        <p>Although the Giants lost their final three games last season, Toomer fattened up his personal statistics by producing two games of nine catches apiece. He also had a six-catch performance in the victory over the Jets.</p>
        <p>''I felt last season, the last few games, I was getting hot, and this season comes in and it just stopped,'' Toomer said.</p>
        <p>Actually, it only stopped recently. Toomer had games of four, five and seven receptions earlier this season. Then, he became a nonfactor.</p>
        <p>''I was disappointed,'' he said today about being benched. ''I don't think it helped me. I don't think it helped the offense.''</p>
        <p>Quarterback Kerry Collins is presiding over an offensive operation with a small margin for error. The running game has been outstanding more often than not. But when it has not, the passing game has not compensated for it.</p>
        <p>So the Giants' offense has been blessed by having the defense to offset some errors. The Giants have turned over the ball 10 times, including 7 interceptions of Collins. But because the Giants have produced 14 takeaways, they boast the National Football Conference's second-best takeaway-giveaway differential: plus-4.</p>
        <p>When the Giants do pass, it is not deep. They win despite failing almost two-thirds of the time to convert third downs. It is not an attack that can afford offside penalties or missed routes or dropped balls.</p>
        <p>''I think we're all frustrated,'' Collins said. ''I think Amani's frustrated.''</p>
        <p>Did Toomer think he was benched to light a fire under him?</p>
        <p>''I don't know what they're thinking,'' he said. ''It could drive you crazy.''</p>
        <p>So he did not need this jolt to play better?</p>
        <p>''No,'' he said. ''I needed to play.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Although there is no reason to pencil anyone in as a starter during this bye week, the defensive coordinator JOHN FOX said that ''if we were playing tomorrow, Emmanuel would start.'' EMMANUEL McDANIEL came in at cornerback when JASON SEHORN broke a rib and injured his collarbone. . . . The Giants will work out Thursday, and then take off until Monday.</p>
