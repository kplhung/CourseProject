        <p>In the debate on Sunday night among the candidates for United States senator from Georgia, former Senator Mack Mattingly scored what he considered a personal triumph: he got Senator Zell Miller to publicly state his choice for president, live and on camera.</p>
        <p>''Did you see -- I finally got him to say he's going to vote for Al Gore,'' Mr. Mattingly said later in an interview.

        <p>In the debate on Sunday night among the candidates for United States senator from Georgia, former Senator Mack Mattingly scored what he considered a personal triumph: he got Senator Zell Miller to publicly state his choice for president, live and on camera.</p>
        <p>''Did you see -- I finally got him to say he's going to vote for Al Gore,'' Mr. Mattingly said later in an interview. ''He's on the Clinton-Gore team, and Hillary Clinton's team, and he's also got Ted Kennedy on his team. Not me, I'm on the George Bush team, I'm on the Trent Lott team.''</p>
        <p>It was true; Mr. Miller, a popular former governor, had indeed pledged himself to Mr. Gore when pinned down by Mr. Mattingly. Not because he agreed with Mr. Gore on the issues, he quickly made clear, but only because Mr. Gore had helped Georgia in natural disasters and had helped bring the 1996 Olympics to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>In other words, it was not because Mr. Gore and Mr. Miller both happen to be Democrats. The word ''Democrat'' is not uttered by Mr. Miller on the campaign trail, and appears nowhere on his campaign Web site. Technically, this is because the race to replace Senator Paul Coverdell, who died in July, is nonpartisan, with all seven candidates appearing on the Nov. 7 ballot without party affiliation. (There will be a Nov. 28 runoff between the top two candidates if no one gets more than 50 percent of the votes.)</p>
        <p>But the nonpartisan nature of the race has also allowed Mr. Miller to stay at arm's length from Mr. Gore, who is behind in most Georgia polls, and to portray himself as several steps above party bickering in a state where the Republican presence continues to grow. Mr. Mattingly, on the other hand, has built most of his campaign on sharing a party and a conservative ideology with Mr. Coverdell, who was a Republican. The result is one of the stranger campaigns in this divisive political season, one in which the worst insult either candidate can hurl is that his opponent is a member of an organized political party.</p>
        <p>''My opponent does not give you a single reason to vote for him except his party registration,'' Mr. Miller said at a second debate on Monday night. ''I happen to think a pledge to support either party 100 percent of the time is dangerous. This partisan stuff is the problem, not the solution.''</p>
        <p>The unusual formula seems to be working, and Mr. Miller has been well ahead in the same polls that show Mr. Gore trailing. A recent statewide telephone poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed Mr. Miller at 59 percent and Mr. Mattingly at 31 percent, with a margin of sampling error of four  percentage points. The same poll showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas leading Mr. Gore by 16 points in the state.</p>
        <p>Georgia is well aware, of course, that Mr. Miller is a Democrat; in his eight years as governor, he was a popular centrist figure, best known for using lottery money to create a scholarship program for the state's college students. He was executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party in the 1970's, and was an early and vocal supporter of Bill Clinton in 1992. He retired from politics in 1998, but when Gov. Roy Barnes asked him to become acting senator after Mr. Coverdell's death and to run for the seat in the November election, Mr. Miller agreed.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, he said he had never been a partisan Democrat, and had always worked well with Republicans in his years in the State Senate and the governor's office.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing new about being bipartisan,'' he said. ''Until fairly recently, the leaders of both sides would sit around having a knock of bourbon and figure out how to get something passed. Sam Nunn reached across party lines dozens of times. All this partisan stuff came along fairly recently, and I think voters are sick and tired of it.''</p>
        <p>He acknowledged, though, that the state's political composition had changed dramatically since he entered politics in 1960, in the days when Georgia was essentially an all-Democratic state. Many of the suburban newcomers to Georgia in those decades have been Republicans, and a large number of conservative Democrats changed parties in that period, as they did in most other Southern states. Mr. Mattingly, a one-term senator elected in 1980, was one of the architects of the modern Republican Party in Georgia, and he says that only an actual Republican can perpetuate Mr. Coverdell's legacy.</p>
        <p>''The people of the state used to be represented by someone in the majority party in the Senate, but they lost their voice at the table when the Democrat governor appointed a Democrat to Paul Coverdell's seat,'' Mr. Mattingly said. ''Paul and I have identical beliefs and values, and I'm the only one who can become a subcommittee chairman. Zell Miller can't.'' He described Mr. Miller as a ''tax-and-spend liberal'' who would vote with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>The two have spent much more time in these kinds of discussions than on actual policy differences, which appear to be minimal. The most memorable aspect of the race was the Mattingly campaign's parody of an insurance company television commercial in which a duck quacked, ''Back Mack.'' The advertisement annoyed Aflac, the insurance company, which got it pulled after threatening legal action.</p>
