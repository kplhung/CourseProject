        <p>When Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party ceases to be the world's longest-ruling political party on Dec. 1, it will not only surrender control over the presidency. It will also surrender its control over the past. The PRI for decades has zealously kept government archives from public view and pushed its self-serving version of history.

        <p>When Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party ceases to be the world's longest-ruling political party on Dec. 1, it will not only surrender control over the presidency. It will also surrender its control over the past. The PRI for decades has zealously kept government archives from public view and pushed its self-serving version of history. So it is appropriate for President-elect Vicente Fox to promise Mexicans a new look at their own past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox is considering appointing a ''transparency commission'' to shed some light on shameful episodes in the nation's past. Society will demand inquiries into alleged instances of corruption and, at long last, a thorough accounting of the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre of students and other protesters by troops in Mexico City.</p>
        <p>In the political sphere, the burden of the past has not been entirely overcome with one historic presidential election, as evidenced by last Sunday's gubernatorial election in the southeastern state of Tabasco. Both the PRI and the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (P.R.D.) are declaring a narrow victory. The P.R.D. maintains that the official vote-counting process is tainted. The dispute is of national consequence because the election was presided over by Gov. Roberto Madrazo, who aspires to become the PRI's national leader. Governor Madrazo says he wants to take the party back to its populist roots, amid serious questions whether the PRI can remain united without its ownership of the presidency. Power was the glue holding the PRI's ideologically diverse supporters together for decades.</p>
        <p>As the PRI struggles to redefine itself as an opposition party, the former leader most responsible for its shift away from populism is trying to refurbish his image by peddling his own version of recent history. Carlos Salinas de Gortari, president from 1988 to 1994, created a stir when he returned from a self-imposed exile in Ireland earlier this month to promote his 1,380-page memoir, ''Mexico: A Difficult Step Toward Modernity.'' Mr. Salinas unfairly blames the outgoing president, Ernesto Zedillo, for the party's loss after 71 years in power.</p>
        <p>President Salinas' administration privatized state enterprises, reformed agriculture, mended church-state relations and ushered in the North American Free Trade Agreement. But within four months of leaving office Mr. Salinas departed the country in disgrace, blamed for the economic crisis that followed Mr. Zedillo's decision to devalue the peso in his first month as president. Worse, his brother Raul was arrested after it was revealed that he had squirreled away some $90 million. Last year Raul Salinas was convicted of ordering the assassination of Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI general secretary and his former brother-in-law, and still faces charges of illegal enrichment.</p>
        <p>In his book, Carlos Salinas attributes the dramatic implosion of Mexico's economy in 1995 to his successor's clumsiness in carrying out the December 1994 peso devaluation. Mr. Zedillo clearly made his share of mistakes, but it is misleading to pretend that they derailed an otherwise healthy economy. The peso at the time was wildly overvalued because of Mr. Salinas' determination to maintain an inflated sense of prosperity during his term.</p>
        <p>President Zedillo presided over the PRI's defeat at the polls in July despite high approval ratings not because of the economy, but because of public weariness with his party's corrupt past. No amount of historical spinning can alter that fact.</p>
