        <p>A teachers union analysis of standardized test scores at schools managed by Edison Schools, the country's largest for-profit manager of public schools, finds that Edison students perform no better than students in comparable, traditional public schools.</p>
        <p>The report, prepared by the American Federation of Teachers, the country's second-largest teachers union, and scheduled for release today, analyzed public reports of test scores at 40 Edison schools in eight states.</p>
        <p>While teachers unions have cast a skeptical eye on efforts by companies like Edison to manage public schools, some local federation affiliates, including those in Miami and New York City, have worked closely with Edison to jointly manage new schools.</p>
        <p>The union contrasted its findings with annual reports issued by Edison showing that test scores of students at its schools had continued to increase for several years after the company had taken over a failing school. Most recently, Edison said in August that test scores at its schools had increased at a faster rate than had test scores generally across the country.</p>
        <p>Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the union intended neither to attack Edison nor to discourage school boards from hiring the company.</p>
        <p>Rather, she said, ''we want to make sure people understand that Edison schools are not doing better than comparable public schools that use proven programs.''</p>
        <p>Edison Schools, which is based in New York, strongly disputed the union's analysis. John Chubb, chief education officer, called it ''a dishonest report without any scientific merit,'' which omitted some recent test data and used a method of analysis that was not relevant to the low-performing schools that Edison often was given to manage. Those schools are more properly assessed on their rates of improvement rather than in comparison to other schools, he said.</p>
        <p>H. Christopher Whittle, chief executive of Edison Schools, said, ''I don't think you could find any other school district that is educating 57,000 students, 70 percent of whom are disadvantaged, as we are, and show the rates of improvement we have produced.''</p>
        <p>Because the studies conducted by the union and by Edison measure  performance differently, their results are not necessarily incompatible.</p>
        <p>The union's analysis tries to compare each Edison school with traditionally managed public schools serving similar students. The union says its comparison is relevant to public-school administrators who might consider handing over the management of some schools to for-profit companies like Edison.</p>
        <p>Edison, meanwhile, examined whether test scores at each school improved after it took over, and whether that improvement continued from year to year -- an analysis aimed at rebutting critics who say that while Edison may be able to improve test scores initially, those gains are not likely to be sustained.</p>
        <p>The union examined publicly available state testing data from Edison schools in California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota and Texas. The data show that while students at Edison schools occasionally perform better than similar students at schools elsewhere in the same district or state, the Edison students mostly perform as well as or worse than students in comparable schools.</p>
