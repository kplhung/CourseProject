        <p>Earlier this week, Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, sat in his Capitol Hill office, devouring the new biography of Joe DiMaggio.

Having adjourned last Thursday, most members of the House took the weekend off, as well as Monday, Tuesday and much of the day Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Three weeks before Election Day, lethargy hangs over the Capitol like a heavy fog. In past years as the clock wound down on the Congressional session, lawmakers, especially those in tight races who wanted to get home to campaign, worked feverishly on spending bills. Nerves were frayed. Meetings lasted long into the night. Lobbyists hovered outside, and sometimes inside, rooms where deals were being cut. Lawmakers fretted that negotiations over the budget would fall apart and the government would shut down.</p>
        <p>This year is different.</p>
        <p>Even though it is 18 days past the end of the fiscal year and plenty of work remains, Congress appears to be in no rush.</p>
        <p>The House, back from a four-day weekend, considered a series of minor measures on Tuesday, including the renaming of the National Museum of Art and the naming of a federal courthouse in Seattle for William Kenzo Nakamura, who was among 21 Asian Americans who were awarded the Medal of Honor last spring for their World War II service. Lawmakers went home at 6:10 in the evening and did not return until 4 p.m. today when they began consideration of another series of  minor bills.</p>
        <p>''Patience is a virtue,'' said John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert.</p>
        <p>The Senate has held no hearings this week, and although it had adjourned on Friday, did not consider any major piece of legislation until today at 5 p.m., when it passed a $78 billion agriculture bill. On Tuesday Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, in a monotone read into the records requests for a number of trivial bills to be automatically considered approved.</p>
        <p>Asked by reporters about the contents of one, Mr. Cochran acknowledged, ''I really didn't pay any attention; I was just reading the script.''</p>
        <p>A number of factors have combined to slow Congress' work. Last week, a number of lawmakers traveled to the funeral of Representative Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota. This week, many went to the memorial service in Norfolk, Va., for those killed on the destroyer Cole, and planned to attend the funeral of  Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri.</p>
        <p>With a country at peace and reveling in prosperity, there is little public anger at Congress for not getting its job done. And with most incumbents facing weak challengers and with House and Senate leaders allowing lawmakers time -- often at least four days a week -- back home, there seems to be little pressure for Congress to finish.</p>
        <p>''They're campaigning anyway,'' Mr. Matsui said, ''and so they don't get mad at the leadership and say, 'You guys have to get this done.' ''</p>
        <p>Asked if the House Republican leaders were fending off irate lawmakers eager for Congress to finish its work, Mr. Feehery replied, ''There's not any pressure if they're not here.''</p>
        <p>Congressional Republicans say the White House and the Democrats are as much -- if not more -- to blame for the laggard pace. Republicans accuse the Democrats of stalling on spending bills and assert every time an agreement is near, the White House asks for more money.</p>
        <p>Even those lawmakers in town have little or nothing to do. As the sessions winds down and issues become more politically sensitive, fewer and fewer people -- mainly the Republican House and Senate leaders, their Democratic counterparts and White House officials -- are involved in the negotiations.</p>
        <p>On Monday, while most lawmakers remained in their home states, House and Senate leaders met with Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to try to hammer out agreements on the outstanding spending bills. Those talks, which took place at the home of Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee did not result in any breakthroughs.</p>
        <p>With little progress toward a resolution, the Clinton administration is trying to turn up the heat. White House officials said today that Mr. Clinton would visit Capitol Hill on Thursday to lay out his agenda for the close of the session and call upon the Congress to complete its work.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, told a news conference that President Clinton would sign a temporary spending bill to keep the government running for a ''few days,'' rather than the weeklong measure, known as a continuing resolution -- or ''C.R.'' in Washington argot -- that Congress has been approving.</p>
        <p>''What we've seen now with these weeklong C.R.'s is they pass a weeklong C.R., they take a five-day weekend vacation, and then they come back and work for a day or two,'' Mr. Podesta said. ''And that's not getting the job done. So they ought to stay here. If they have to work a weekend, they ought to work a weekend. The president has been working on weekends, we've been working on weekends.''</p>
        <p>Congressional officials said today that the House and Senate would vote on a continuing resolution that will keep the government running through next Wednesday.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Podesta stopped short of saying that Mr. Clinton would refuse to sign any more short-term spending measures, asserting that the administration had ''no interest in a government shut-down.''</p>
