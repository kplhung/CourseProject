        <p>LUXURY BUILDING  A $50 million luxury building for the elderly, the first in Manhattan developed specifically for that purpose, opened its doors yesterday. Monthly fees -- which cover breakfast and 20 dinners, activities and housekeeping -- for the building, the Hallmark at Battery Park City, range from $3,990 for a studio apartment to $9,290 for two bedrooms and a den. Ulrich R. Wall, the executive director of the Hallmark, said 88 of the 197 apartments for independent living had been rented, as had 2 of the 20 units set aside for people who require more assistance. The building is owned and operated by Brookdale Living Communities, a national company based in Chicago.</p>

        <p>DEVELOPER SOUGHT IN QUEENS  The Giuliani administration is seeking a developer to buy and expand a city-owned garage and commercial building in an area of Long Island City, Queens, where major rezoning is proposed to spur commercial revitalization. The five-story building, with about 180,000 square feet of space, now houses a public garage with 1,100 parking spaces, a furniture store and offices. The proposed rezoning, which would increase the size of buildings permitted on many sites in the area, would allow for about one million square feet of space to be added at the garage site, the city's Economic Development Corporation said. The site, near the end of the Queensboro Bridge, is bounded by Queens Plaza South, Jackson Avenue, 42nd Road and 28th Street. The rezoning proposal requires City Council approval to become law, which could come more than a year from now. But a corporation spokesman, Gregory Miley, said, ''We're confident it will receive all the necessary approvals.''</p>

        <p>HIGH-SPEED TRAIN  Amtrak's long-delayed high-speed train, the Acela Express, will begin service between Washington and Boston on Dec. 11, railroad officials announced at a news conference yesterday in Washington. Acela trains will travel up to 150 m.p.h., compared with other Amtrak trains, which reach a top speed of 125 m.p.h. The high-speed trains will shorten the typical four-hour trip between Boston and New York by one hour. The first train's arrival was was highlighted during the news conference, and 19 more have been ordered for next summer. The service was scheduled to begin last October but premature wheel wear and problems with the technology that helps the train negotiate curves were among the causes for the delay. The railroad is under a congressional order to become financially self-sufficient by 2003. High-speed service in the Northeast Corridor is projected to earn $180 million a year.</p>
