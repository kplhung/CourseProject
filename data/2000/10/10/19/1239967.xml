        <p>Beneath skies as gray as the warships looming behind him, President Clinton paid tribute today to the crew of the destroyer Cole, the living and the dead. He vowed that those who bombed the ship in the Yemeni port at Aden six days ago would not escape American justice.</p>
        <p>''To those who attacked them we say: you will not find a safe harbor,'' Mr. Clinton said, speaking slowly at an emotional memorial service held at the sprawling naval base here. ''We will find you, and justice will prevail.''</p>

        <p>Beneath skies as gray as the warships looming behind him, President Clinton paid tribute today to the crew of the destroyer Cole, the living and the dead. He vowed that those who bombed the ship in the Yemeni port at Aden six days ago would not escape American justice.</p>
        <p>''To those who attacked them we say: you will not find a safe harbor,'' Mr. Clinton said, speaking slowly at an emotional memorial service held at the sprawling naval base here. ''We will find you, and justice will prevail.''</p>
        <p>Appearing before thousands of sailors and their families, including those of the 17 sailors killed on the Cole, Mr. Clinton pledged that the attack would not deter the United States from ''working to keep peace and stability in a region that could explode and disrupt the entire world.''</p>
        <p>As the president completed his remarks, John Clodfelter of Mechanicsville, Va., whose son Kenneth is among those listed as missing but presumed dead, stood and directly addressed Mr. Clinton. ''When the people who did this are punished, let them go with three words: 'Remember the Cole,' '' said Mr. Clodfelter, who wept through much of the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton leaned over the lectern and replied simply, ''Thank you, sir.'' Then he saluted.</p>
        <p>Even as American investigators on the other side of the world pursued tantalizing yet still inconclusive leads, the president and much of the nation's political and military leadership assembled here to honor the victims of the worst terrorist attack on American forces since the bombing of a barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 killed 19 airmen. It was, above all, an effort to assure their families that their losses would not be in vain.</p>
        <p>Among those who gathered on Pier 12 -- flanked on one side by two of the Cole's sister ships, the destroyers Ross and McFaul, and on the other by the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower -- were Attorney General Janet Reno, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, the secretaries of defense and the Navy, and the uniformed commanders of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Also attending was Yemen's ambassador to the United States, Abdulwahab A. al-Hajjri, in what officials described as a gesture of Yemen's cooperation in the aftermath of the attack.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Clinton's remarks and in those of others who spoke today, there was an unmistakable resolution for vengeance.</p>
        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen called the bombing of the Cole ''an act of pure evil.'' Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed like a thunderclap Mr. Clinton's warnings to those involved in the attack, saying they should ''never forget that America's memory is long and our reach longer.''</p>
        <p>Across the concrete pier, a crowd estimated by the Navy to exceed 10,000 people listened in respectful, mournful silence. Sailors in crisp white uniforms lined the railings of the Ross, McFaul and Eisenhower, standing at parade rest.</p>
        <p>Relatives clutched photographs of the Cole's victims and wore black and yellow ribbons (black for the dead, yellow for those missing, one officer said, and also the Cole's colors). Many in the audience wept, including the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. At the end of the service, after a lone bugler atop the McFaul's prow blew taps, the mother of Seaman Timothy L. Gauna, another of those still missing, wailed uncontrollably, ''Oh, Timothy.''</p>
        <p>All but one of 37 wounded sailors flown back to the Cole's home port here in recent days attended the service -- several of them still on hospital gurneys, with intravenous lines stuck in their arms and oxygen tubes in their noses. The only applause of the day came when a fleet of ambulances and buses brought the wounded to the pier.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Mr. Clinton slowly read the names of each of the 17 who died. Since the bombing, the nation has learned a little about each, about their lives, their dreams, their reasons for joining the Navy, he said. One of them, Chief Petty Officer Richard Costelow, 35, of Morrisville, Pa., had once worked at the White House, helping update its communications systems.</p>
        <p>The diversity of the victims' backgrounds, he added, reflected the best of America and the values that the military sought to protect abroad.</p>
        <p>''In the names and faces of those we lost and mourn, the world sees our nation's greatest strength,'' said Mr. Clinton, who appeared weary, having returned late Tuesday night from negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt. ''People in uniform rooted in every race, creed and region on the face of the earth, yet bound together by a common commitment to freedom and a common pride in being American.''</p>
        <p>Before the service Mr. Clinton, accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, met privately at the base with 85 relatives of those killed. A spokesman said the president had huddled closely with several, somberly consoling them. He also met the wounded sailors.</p>
