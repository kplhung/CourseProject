        <p>Pointing to the strongest quarter ever for its Windows operating system, Microsoft yesterday surpassed analysts' earnings estimates for the latest quarter.</p>
        <p>After the stock market closed, the company reported first-quarter earnings of 46 cents a share, up from 40 cents a year earlier and handily topping analysts' expectations of 41 cents, as reported to the First Call/Thomson Financial market research firm.</p>

        <p>Pointing to the strongest quarter ever for its Windows operating system, Microsoft yesterday surpassed analysts' earnings estimates for the latest quarter.</p>
        <p>After the stock market closed, the company reported first-quarter earnings of 46 cents a share, up from 40 cents a year earlier and handily topping analysts' expectations of 41 cents, as reported to the First Call/Thomson Financial market research firm.</p>
        <p>While the world's largest independent software company repeated its familiar cautions about potential perils of the global economy, it also said the quarter's results indicated that no slowdown in the desktop personal computer market loomed on the horizon.</p>
        <p>The subject of whether the PC industry is moving away from its historical double-digit growth rate and toward becoming a replacement business and whether Microsoft will become a victim of the much heralded ''Post-PC Era'' is a perennial one for analysts who follow the company.</p>
        <p>The company's revenue growth, year to year, jumped from 8 percent to 11 percent, said John Connors, Microsoft's chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>''It feels good to be back in double-digit growth,'' he said. ''The king is not dead.''</p>
        <p>Analysts, however, cautioned that while Microsoft's numbers for the quarter were strong, they were not stellar and that in the future the company would continue to grapple with the fact that its desktop software business is a mature one.</p>
        <p>''When all is said and done, the quarter was a little better than expected,'' said Andrew Brosseau, an analyst at SG Cowan Securities in Boston. ''But while you can push these numbers around, the company is still pulling a legacy business which accounts for 70 percent of their revenue, and that is not likely to accelerate.''</p>
        <p>For its first fiscal quarter, which ended Sept. 30, the company announced income before an accounting change of $2.58 billion, compared with $2.19 billion for the quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter reached $5.8 billion, up from $5.38 billion a year ago.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with analysts, the company said it believed it would be able to maintain its growth rate.</p>
        <p>''It seems likely that revenue will be up in the low teens'' year to year, Mr. Connors said, and up in the high teens quarter to quarter.</p>
        <p>Microsoft stock closed at $51.75, up $1.31, on volume of 55.3 million shares in Nasdaq trading. The shares rose a further 5 percent in after-hours trading. Mr. Connors also said he expected Microsoft earnings for its full fiscal year to come in slightly higher than the current consensus analyst estimate of $1.88 a share because of stronger-than-expected performance in its first quarter.</p>
        <p>Microsoft did not reveal the adoption rate of its new Windows 2000 operating system, which is aimed at the corporate market, or its Windows ME program, intended for home users.</p>
        <p>Windows 2000, introduced this spring, has generally received high marks from corporate users, though many analysts have said those users have been cautious.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Windows ME has generally played to lackluster press reviews.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the company gave some indication of large corporate commitments to the Windows 2000 program, citing customers like NASA, Siemens and Motorola, each of which is planning to deploy tens of thousands of copies of the program.</p>
        <p>During the conference call the company also referred to weakness in its European business, which is experiencing both slower growth and currency conversion issues. Revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa declined from $1.18 billion for the first quarter of 1999 to $1.08 billion in the latest quarter.</p>
        <p>Microsoft had its strongest growth in Asia, where revenue rose 19 percent, to $708 million. The company said that much of the growth reflected language-specific versions of Office 2000 and its corporate NT and Windows 2000 operating systems.</p>
        <p>The company also said that first-quarter income from its investment portfolio increased to $1.13 billion from $550 million in the first quarter of the prior year.</p>
        <p>In a speech at an industry conference yesterday in Orlando, Fla., Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said the company expected to win its battle with the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>Microsoft is now appealing a federal judge's order to split the company into competing operating systems and applications businesses.</p>
        <p>''We remain convinced we will not be broken up,'' Mr. Ballmer said, ''and we are not putting a lot of energy on it. It is not really a question we spend time dwelling on. It is not actionable for us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ballmer said the company's most significant challenge remained finding and keeping talented people.</p>
        <p>''The greatest challenge is in attracting, retaining and developing incredible people,'' he said. ''The transient nature of the work force has been a challenge for us.''</p>
