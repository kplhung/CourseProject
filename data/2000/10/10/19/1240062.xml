        <p>The bodies of six illegal immigrants, believed to have suffocated in a truck, were found dumped on the side of a highway in southern Italy today, a grim reminder of the perils of trying to immigrate to Europe.</p>
        <p>An Italian police spokesman in Foggia said the six victims, men between the ages of 20 and 40, were believed to be Kurds.</p>
        <p>Some wounds suggested that the victims had been thrown to the ground from a moving vehicle. The police said that the body of one victim, whose head was crushed, might have been run over by the truck as it fled.</p>
        <p>The brutality of their deaths was reminiscent of a horror last June when the bodies of 58 Chinese immigrants were discovered in a truck at the port of Dover, in England.</p>
        <p>Italy is a major port of entry to Europe for desperate would-be immigrants from Albania, Turkey, Iraq and Africa. Thousands of them land on the shores of southern Italy every year, often paying smugglers thousands of dollars for a place on a cramped, dangerous boat that will carry them across the Adriatic Sea. Many are caught, others escape, and some die in the effort. Last November, 14 Kurdish immigrants who were stowaways on a passenger ferryboat from Greece to Italy died when a fire broke out on board.</p>
        <p>Today, Msgr. Francesco Ruppi, archbishop of Lecce, a southern city on the front lines of illegal immigration, mourned the six victims, saying, ''These days the dead cannot be counted, and the most disconcerting thing is that they have become routine, almost normal occurrences in something that every day becomes more grim and more terrible.''</p>
        <p>Italy has been trying to crack down on illegal immigration. In the first six months of this year, the Italian police say they apprehended 59,107 illegal immigrants and expelled more than 30,000 of them.</p>
        <p>Immigrants, legal and illegal, make up a tiny percentage of Italy's population of 57 million, but public fears over crime and unemployment have made immigration a potent political and social issue.</p>
        <p>Many immigrants are Muslim. Last month, Cardinal Giacomo Biffi, archbishop of Bologna, suggested that Italy should favor only Christian immigration to ''preserve the identity of the nation.''</p>
