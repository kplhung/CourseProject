        <p>In the wake of the success of the Palm, the shape of personal digital assistants has morphed to imitate the large, open face of Palm devices. But Diamond Multimedia, the company that introduced the first commercial MP3 music player a couple of years ago, has decided to go retro with  its new P.D.A., the Mako.</p>
        <p>About the size of an eyeglass case, the Mako is built into a clamshell design with a tiny qwerty keyboard, much like the first organizers that flooded electronic stores in the early 1990's.</p>

        <p>In the wake of the success of the Palm, the shape of personal digital assistants has morphed to imitate the large, open face of Palm devices. But Diamond Multimedia, the company that introduced the first commercial MP3 music player a couple of years ago, has decided to go retro with  its new P.D.A., the Mako.</p>
        <p>About the size of an eyeglass case, the Mako is built into a clamshell design with a tiny qwerty keyboard, much like the first organizers that flooded electronic stores in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>But the Mako is far more powerful, running on a 32-bit processor and coming with 16 megabytes of storage.</p>
        <p>Billed as a ''connected organizer,'' the Mako comes with word processing and spreadsheet software as well as standard P.D.A. goodies like contact and agenda programs.</p>
        <p>When coupled with optional accessories, like a 56K travel modem, the Mako, which costs $399, can send and receive e-mail like a much bigger desktop computer does, as well as communicate wirelessly with digital telephones with infrared capabilities.</p>
