        <p>Pace of Inflation Picks Up As Economy Seems to Slow  Inflation is on pace for its largest annual jump in a decade, the government reported, although the price increases remain largely confined to energy costs. The report further complicates the picture of an economy that seems to be slowing even as inflation, one of the most common effects of rapid growth, is rising more rapidly than economists have anticipated.</p>
        <p>The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in September and is growing at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Inflation last topped 3.5 percent in 1990, when it reached 6.1 percent. [Page C4.]</p>

        <p>Tire Recall Pulls Down Ford Results  This autumn's recall of Firestone light-truck tires led to Ford Motor's first quarterly drop in operating income in four years. Ford's third-quarter profit from continuing operations dropped 16 percent, in line with analysts' estimates. Shares of Ford rose 63 cents, to $25.06. Separately, Bridgestone/Firestone announced a reorganization, consolidating 21 operating units into 4 with Japanese executives taking control of key operations. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Two U.S. Money Managers Are Sold  Two European financial firms struck deals for asset management firms in the United States, part of a trend that has Europeans shopping for American investment firms. Allianz of Germany, Europe's second-largest insurer, agreed to pay up to $2.2 billion to acquire Nicholas-Applegate, a privately held firm that manages $45 billion in institutional accounts and mutual funds. ABN Amro, the largest Dutch bank, agreed to pay $825 million for Alleghany Asset Management. [C19.]</p>
        <p>Chase's Profit Falls; Morgan's Rises  Chase Manhattan, whose stock had already fallen 34 percent since it announced its $31 billion merger with J. P. Morgan last month, gave investors more bad news. Chase announced a 26 percent decline in third-quarter operating earnings, which was far below what analysts had expected. In contrast, J. P. Morgan reported a 25 percent increase in net income, above Wall Street forecasts. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Euro Sinks to Low Against Dollar  The euro sank to a new low against the dollar, two days after the president of the European Central Bank provoked a furor by publicly suggesting that central banks would not intervene soon to strengthen the struggling currency. In New York, the euro settled at 83.76 cents, down from 85.58 cents. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Slowdown Seen in Advertising Sales  After years of white-hot intensity, most recently driven by a media buying frenzy by start-up dot-com companies, the television advertising marketplace is cooling by almost all accounts. While some network executives have disputed some earlier reports of weakening in the ad marketplace, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, acknowledged that the issue was becoming a problem. He predicted at a shareholders meeting in Australia that advertising sales for the Fox Entertainment Group in the United States ''look a little uncertain.'' Advertising. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Vin and Sprit Joins Seagram Bid  Vin and Sprit, the Swedish state-owned company that owns the rights to Absolut vodka, has joined forces with Bacardi International and Brown-Forman to bid for the drinks business of Seagram. [World Business, Section W.]</p>
        <p>A Case for Higher Gasoline Taxes  The United States is passing up a big opportunity by not taxing gasoline at a higher rate. If you've got to tax something, it makes sense to tax something that is costly to the environment and users and is mostly controlled by foreigners. Hal R. Varian: Economic Scene. [C2.]</p>
