        <p>Sensing that Vice President Al Gore's debate performance on Tuesday night has revived his candidacy, Mr. Gore's advisers said today that they wanted to buy 90 minutes of time on cable television channels in various swing states to rebroadcast the entire debate.</p>
        <p>The move is part of the campaign's action plan, built around the slogan ''The Big Choice: Prosperity For All,'' and inaugurating the final three-week push toward Election Day.</p>
        <p>The plan is based on the premise that Mr. Gore's debate performance was unusually strong and provided the vice president ammunition both to make the case for himself as the best steward of the nation's economy and to make the case against Gov. George W. Bush as someone who would bankrupt Social Security and give most tax cuts to the rich.</p>
        <p>The campaign began broadcasting three new television commercials today that underscored these themes. The commercials are running in 12 swing states and will be reinforced by three major speeches in the next few days -- an economic speech on Thursday in New York and speeches on Saturday in New Orleans and on Sunday in Dallas about his priorities and how they reflect his values. Except for a brief stop on Saturday in Washington to watch his son play football, Mr. Gore is expected to be on the road continuously until Election Day, Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>Campaign officials were clearly pleased with Mr. Gore's performance in the debate, which most polls showed the vice president had won.</p>
        <p>Virtually crowing about Mr. Gore's performance, Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager, said: ''Last night allayed a lot of concerns.'' He said that the debate had fortified Gore representatives today as they met with Democrats on Capitol Hill who had been worried about Mr. Gore's previously weak  debates and sagging poll numbers.</p>
        <p>''We're going to move votes based on last night's debate,'' Mr. Fabiani said.</p>
        <p>Gore officials contend that Mr. Bush made two major blunders in the debate. The governor agreed that ''of course'' most of his tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, because, as Mr. Bush said, they are the ones who pay the most taxes. And he said that his plan to privatize part of Social Security would cost $1 trillion, money that would come from the Social Security trust fund -- an admission that Mr. Gore said today essentially conceded that Mr. Bush would bankrupt Social Security in 23 years, 14 years sooner than was now projected.</p>
        <p>A newly plucky Mr. Gore appeared on the campaign trail today as he traveled from Missouri to Iowa to Michigan and headed for New York late tonight.</p>
        <p>''Social Security is on the ballot this fall,'' Mr. Gore told about 200 people in Des Moines. As if speaking to Mr. Bush, he added: ''Don't promise it away. Don't use fuzzy math. You promise the same trillion to two different groups. That's fuzzy math. You want to talk about fuzzy math, that's plenty fuzzy.'' Mr. Bush had accused Mr. Gore in the first debate of using ''fuzzy math.''</p>
        <p>At an outdoor rally here tonight,  Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of being in the pocket of the big drug companies. ''He does what they want,'' Mr. Gore roared to the crowd of thousands. ''That's just the hard truth.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore was well aware that he also had to battle negative impressions that Mr. Bush sought to raise about him during the debate --  one, that Mr. Gore was an advocate of big government and, two, that he did not understand that younger entrepreneurial-minded voters wanted to invest part of their Social Security taxes in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore sought to reassure his audience that he did not want to expand government. ''I'll make our government smaller and smarter,'' he pledged. He said he would do this in part by putting many government services online. ''I want create a federal government where you never have to stand in line because you can get it online.''</p>
        <p>On the subject of investing Social Security, Nancy Nichols, an older voter in Des Moines, said she was concerned that Mr. Gore had not made his position plain enough. She said that a young Republican had told her that in the time that he had paid $9,000 into Social Security, he had also invested $9,000 in stocks -- and that those stocks were now worth $18,000. ''Under your plan, they still would have that opportunity if they were willing to save, but I don't think that part of your plan or that message has gotten across,'' Ms. Nichols told the vice president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore mocked the idea of older people investing their Social Security in the stock market. He gestured to Winnie Skinner, 79, a Des Moines resident whom he made famous last month because she recycled aluminum cans for extra money, who was sitting in today's audience, and said, ''So, are you ready to get on the Internet and be a day-trader, Winnie?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Skinner said in response, ''What's that?''</p>
