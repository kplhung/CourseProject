        <p>FOUR years ago, buried in the conference notes for a gathering of engineers, was an unlikely description of one of the participants, a software designer named Moses Ma:</p>
        <p>''His primary goal is to achieve balance and happiness in life and encourages every one of you to take time to smell the roses on your way to that I.P.O.''</p>

        <p>FOUR years ago, buried in the conference notes for a gathering of engineers, was an unlikely description of one of the participants, a software designer named Moses Ma:</p>
        <p>''His primary goal is to achieve balance and happiness in life and encourages every one of you to take time to smell the roses on your way to that I.P.O.''</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Ma has made a point of following his own advice. His company, BizBots, which he founded two years ago, is a business-to-business e-commerce firm that focuses on what Mr. Ma describes as the ''dynamics of marketplaces.'' The company is small, but well endowed, with approximately $12 million in venture capital.</p>
        <p>Like others in charge of small start-ups, Mr. Ma, a 44-year-old veteran of the video game industry, requires that his 41 employees work long hours. But he also asks them to write poetry and read it in front of an audience. He encourages them to learn to make sculptures and offers occasional classes. His reasoning is that the creativity required to write a poem or carve a piece of sculpture helps his employees balance their lives, making them more productive and innovative as they design and sell the BizBots software.</p>
        <p>''The first thing a start-up does is remove your ability to notice that you're out of balance, because it seduces you with the adrenaline thrill ride and with dreams of an I.P.O.,'' he said. ''It's all about survival and stress and averting near meltdown once a week.'' He said the poetry helps employees deal with the stress by seeing life differently and ''brings some calmness to the Internet storm.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma came to the United States from Hong Kong at age 2. His parents, refugees from the Sinkiang province in northwestern China, were in Hong Kong awaiting entry permits to this country when Mr. Ma was born in 1956. They named him Moses, after ''the world's most famous refugee,'' Mr. Ma said. He  made his mark on the video game world 10 years ago with his design of Spectre VR, one of the first games that could played over a network. His insistence on enjoyment came after observing a number of teachers through the years, including the physicist Richard Feynman, whose courses Mr. Ma attended while an undergraduate student at the California Institute of Technology studying theoretical physics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma recalled one lecture, in particular, when Dr. Feynman was explaining the nature of superfluidity and discussed smoke rings, as a way to illustrate the lesson. When a student asked what a smoke ring was, the physicist responded: ''You don't know what a smoke ring is? My boy, you've never really lived!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma, who also studied comparative religion and philosophy in college, said the poetry readings are his effort to make sure his employees really live.</p>
        <p>BizBots employees are not required to read at the ''slams,'' as Mr. Ma calls the readings, but those who do not read at the first one they attend are often inspired to do so at the next.</p>
        <p>George Lipsker, the executive vice president for sales and marketing, joined BizBots five months ago, when he moved to San Francisco from New York, and said the poetry readings took some getting used to. ''At first blush, it was a bit warm and cuddly for my taste,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lipsker said he had not written a poem since high school, yet he produced a ''mushy love poem,'' screwed up his courage and read it aloud at a slam. Not only did it distract him from the stress of his work, Mr. Lipsker said, but it helped him put challenges in perspective. ''If I can break down the barrier of writing a poem and reading it in front of an audience,'' he said, ''it makes other things look easy.''</p>
        <p>The most recent slam, held in July at a run-down yet functional theater in San Francisco, attracted not just BizBot employees but also a few dozen friends and acquaintances of Mr. Ma's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma was one of the first to read a poem, cheerfully oblivious to its literary merits. It was a piece of free verse that appeared to draw its influence from an obscure branch of the Beat school:</p>
        <p>Haunted by a sunbrown peasant girl bursting with life</p>
        <p>you, the one shopping for shoes</p>
        <p>it's pitiful how I beg on your sidewalk for some spare change of affection.</p>
        <p>Other poems were by turns serious, romantic, goofy and bawdy. One employee brought his parents, and the three recited their rhymes one after the other.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma is not unaware of the public relations value of the poetry readings. When the BizBots marketing department told him that the CBS television news program ''48 Hours''  was going to videotape the slam in July, he had the event catered in lavish style and made certain that plenty of other members of the news media were invited.</p>
        <p>In the end, the ''48 Hours'' crew didn't show up. The producers decided to do a segment on eligible bachelors in Silicon Valley instead. They invited Mr. Ma, who has never married, to participate, but he declined. ''Too lurid,'' Mr. Ma said, dismissively. ''Not the kind of message I want to spread.''</p>
        <p>Investors and business partners alike are amused and inspired by Mr. Ma's unusual leadership approach. Last year, Roman Kikta, director of strategy and business creation at the Nokia Ventures Organization, a business group of the Nokia Corporation, traveled with a Nokia senior executive from Texas to San Francisco for a meeting with Mr. Ma. When they arrived, they found themselves being directed not into a conference room but into a sculpture studio.</p>
        <p>''There was a model, fully nude, and Moses says: 'Here's a clump of clay. Sculpt,' '' Mr. Kikta recalled. ''We conducted the meeting while we were sculpting.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Kikta made a sculpture of just the model's head. He was so proud of his creation that he was dejected when it was lost en route back to Texas.</p>
        <p>In keeping with his unorthodox management style, Mr. Ma has no office of his own. Instead, he floats between the firm's two locations, a 12-minute walk apart, carrying his laptop in his black backpack and setting up a temporary work space in conference rooms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma's girlfriend, Nina Markman, 32, a professional sculptor, had the idea for the sculpture classes. She also works at BizBots as the director of user interface.</p>
        <p>''Most people are shocked by how much fun it is and how good they are,'' Ms. Markman said. ''They lose themselves, and everyone is so happy to be in an environment that is so different from the dot-com environment. It's just a relief.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma is not in the least coy about his desire to become wealthy and retire ''as soon as possible.'' But since last spring's Nasdaq plunge, his hopes of a multimillion-dollar public offering for BizBots have dampened. ''In the current climate, I don't think anyone is thinking about an I.P.O. anymore,'' he said. ''But, yeah, I want it desperately.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma is a tireless networker, cultivating connections with people from all spheres, or at least trying, even if all his efforts don't bear fruit.</p>
        <p>Although no relation to the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Mr. Ma recently discovered that they were guests at the same hotel in New York. Using their common name as his premise, he left a message suggesting they have breakfast. The breakfast didn't take place, but Mr. Ma received a personal note from the musician suggesting lunch in San Francisco sometime instead.</p>
