        <p>A  highly inconvenient law of physics states that two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Consequently, as New York rejoices in the first Subway Series since my high school days of 1956, we also lament that two of the three sacred places of past contests -- Brooklyn's Ebbets Field and the Giants' Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan -- now exist only as memories beneath housing projects, and not as material realities.</p>
        <p>But I suggest a look on the bright side, spurred by a metaphor that Freud devised to begin his book with a quintessential New York title: ''Civilization and Its Discontents.'' Freud acknowledged the physical reality cited above, but he celebrated, in happy contrast, the mind's power to overlay current impressions directly upon past memories. The mind, he argued, might be compared with a mythical Rome that could raise a modern civic building upon a medieval cathedral built over a classical temple, while preserving all three structures in the same spot: ''Where the Colosseum now stands we could at the same time admire Nero's vanished Golden House . . . . The same piece of ground would be supporting the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva and the ancient temple over which it was built.''</p>

        <p>But I suggest a look on the bright side, spurred by a metaphor that Freud devised to begin his book with a quintessential New York title: ''Civilization and Its Discontents.'' Freud acknowledged the physical reality cited above, but he celebrated, in happy contrast, the mind's power to overlay current impressions directly upon past memories. The mind, he argued, might be compared with a mythical Rome that could raise a modern civic building upon a medieval cathedral built over a classical temple, while preserving all three structures in the same spot: ''Where the Colosseum now stands we could at the same time admire Nero's vanished Golden House . . . . The same piece of ground would be supporting the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva and the ancient temple over which it was built.''</p>
        <p>Thus, I can watch Roger Clemens striking out 15 Mariners in a brilliant one-hitter and place his frame right on top of Don Larsen pitching his perfect game (27 Bums up, 27 Bums down) in 1956. And I can admire the grace of Bernie Williams in center field, while my teenage memories see Mantle's intensity, and my first impressions of childhood recall DiMaggio's elegance, in exactly the same spot. I can then place all three images upon the foundation of my father's stories of DiMaggio as a rookie in the 1936 Series, and my grandfather Papa Joe's tales of Babe Ruth in the first three New York Series of 1921-1923.</p>
        <p>The reality of a Subway Series grew from modest roots and routes. The first two New York Series, in 1921 and 1922, never left the Polo Grounds (for both the Yanks and Giants then played in the same park). Yankee Stadium opened in time for the 1923 threepeat of Yanks vs. Giants (and the first Yankee victory), but a short walk across the Harlem River sufficed, as the two ballparks stood in literal shouting distance one from the other. Yankee victories over the Giants in 1936 and 1937 also required no more than a stroll. The first true ''Subway Series'' occurred a month after my birth in 1941, as distant Brooklyn finally prevailed. Six more subway contests between the Yanks and Dodgers followed (1947, '49, '52, '53, '55, and '56), all won by the Yanks with a tragic exception in 1955 (prompting a memorable headline in the Brooklyn Eagle: ''Who's a Bum?''). One strolling Series between the Yanks and Giants intervened in 1951, as I struggled to restore my Yankee loyalty after rooting so hard for the Giants against the hated Dodgers.</p>
        <p>Geography then expanded even more dramatically as several subsequent Series pitted the Yanks against the transplanted Dodgers and Giants of California. But, to any real New Yorker, these contests simply don't count.</p>
        <p>The Mets, to me, are still an expansion team, but who's complaining after a 44-year drought, as Subway Series No. 14 initiates the new millennium? What can I say? The Subway Series of my youth shaped my life and my dreams, and established the milestones of timing and memory for all later accomplishments. In the peace of midlife, just a few years shy of those senior discounts, I can even place the Freudian calm of experience upon the passions of unforgiving boyhood -- and finally come to terms with the Dodgers' victory, and the spoilage of Yankee perfection, in 1955.</p>
        <p>I met Roy Campanella at a university cocktail party several years ago. Incredibly, he sat alone, talking with no one. So I walked over, still in the awe of remembered youth, and knelt by his wheelchair for the most memorable half hour of conversation in all my life.</p>
        <p>He wore a World Series ring on each finger of his left hand, but one exceeded all the others in size and brilliance. So I said, ''I know the year of that biggest ring. That must be for 1955, when you finally beat us.'' And this great man simply replied with such a heartfelt candor and pleasure: ''Yes, I am so proud.'' And, at that moment and forever, a little, but persistent, wound of my youth healed, and all shone bright and good.</p>
