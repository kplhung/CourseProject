        <p>Inflation is now on pace for its largest annual jump in a decade, the government reported yesterday, although the price increases remain largely confined to energy costs.</p>
        <p>The report further complicates the picture of an economy that seems to be slowing even as inflation, one of the most common effects of rapid growth, is rising more rapidly than economists have anticipated.</p>
        <p>The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in September and is now growing at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The last year in which inflation topped 3.5 percent was 1990, when it reached 6.1 percent.</p>
        <p>The closely watched core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food costs, stood at 0.3 percent in September, up from 0.2 percent, where it has been since April. Much of its growth came in the costs of clothing and tobacco. Analysts said the change reflected conditions specific to those industries and did not suggest that the tripling of oil prices over the last two years is causing widespread price increases in other sectors.</p>
        <p>''Over all, the numbers aren't good, but the details are less alarming,'' said Ian Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The report adds to the uncertainty about whether the 10-year economic expansion is waning. On the one hand, stock prices have been falling for much of the last six months, and several big-name companies, including I.B.M. on Tuesday, have recently announced lower-than-expected sales. On the other, the United States unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent last month, tying a 30-year low, while inflation is rising about twice as quickly as it did in the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>The Federal Open Market Committee has kept short-term interest rates steady at 6.5 percent at its last three meetings. Most recently, the committee said it was more likely to raise rates in the coming months, to ward off inflation, than it was to lower them in an attempt to give the economy a boost.</p>
        <p>Separately, the Social Security Administration announced yesterday that it would lift retirees' benefits by 3.5 percent in December, based on inflation data for the last 12 months. That is the largest cost-of-living adjustment since 1991.</p>
        <p>Still, few economists saw major reason for alarm in the inflation numbers. Energy prices -- which account for about one out of every $14 that consumers spend -- rose 3.8 percent and are almost 20 percent higher than they were last year. But crude oil prices have fallen somewhat in the first half of this month, suggesting that gasoline and home heating costs will drop as well, said Patrick C. Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who specializes in the consumer index.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, there is only slight evidence that rising energy prices have caused companies to charge more for other goods, as happened during the oil shocks of the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The evidence is mainly in the service sector, where prices have risen over the last year by 3.7 percent. ''This does reflect some spillover from higher energy costs,'' said Mark Vitner, a vice president at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, hourly wages in the United States have grown about 2 percent -- or 1.5 percentage points less than inflation -- and workers are starting to demand raises to help them cover the new costs, Mr. Vitner said. Wages represent the largest portion of costs for many services companies.</p>
