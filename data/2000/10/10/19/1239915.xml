        <p>''The Love for Three Oranges'' is a period piece within a period piece that relies on our enduring sense of the ridiculous for its survival. Prokofiev's 80-year-old opera, revived on Tuesday night at the New York City Opera, rehabilitates Carlo Gozzi's mid-18th-century stage work for use against a new set of enemies.</p>
        <p>Gozzi was making fun of the elevated and successful plays of Carlo Goldoni, his contemporary. Prokofiev and his colleagues found themselves wriggling free from the weight of 19th-century highmindedness, and what better way than a return to commedia dell'arte, with its stylized characters, irrational plots and rejections of subtlety. Just as Gozzi ridiculed what he thought pompous in his own time, Prokofiev, Stravinsky and a whole raft of Frenchmen were saying no to a century and a half of searing Romantic passions.</p>

        <p>''The Love for Three Oranges'' is a period piece within a period piece that relies on our enduring sense of the ridiculous for its survival. Prokofiev's 80-year-old opera, revived on Tuesday night at the New York City Opera, rehabilitates Carlo Gozzi's mid-18th-century stage work for use against a new set of enemies.</p>
        <p>Gozzi was making fun of the elevated and successful plays of Carlo Goldoni, his contemporary. Prokofiev and his colleagues found themselves wriggling free from the weight of 19th-century highmindedness, and what better way than a return to commedia dell'arte, with its stylized characters, irrational plots and rejections of subtlety. Just as Gozzi ridiculed what he thought pompous in his own time, Prokofiev, Stravinsky and a whole raft of Frenchmen were saying no to a century and a half of searing Romantic passions.</p>
        <p>Theater like this becomes fragile as it moves through time, however, because it depends as much on what it is against as what it is. I wonder, for example, if Virgil Thomson's operas, themselves an offshoot of commedia dell'arte, will ever again be as fresh for audiences as they were when Thomson was attacking the conventions of his own time. City Opera's production, designed by Maurice Sendak and directed by Frank Corsaro, trusts Gozzi and Prokofiev to be themselves.</p>
        <p>Julie Taymor's ''Green Bird'' on Broadway recently updated Gozzi's art with subtle injections of modern urban angst. Mr. Corsaro is content with re-creations: jugglers, stiltwalkers, tumblers, loud costumes and beaklike masks crowd the stage.</p>
        <p>With its cut-out sets and painted panels, Mr. Sendak's art fits nicely. The carnival setting and magical voyages let him indulge a taste for fantastical animals, oversize puppets and whimsical takes on Baroque stage machinery. The production is from 1985 but looks more tired than that. One notes a creeping drabness, and Mr. Sendak's art is anything but that.</p>
        <p>The story of the opera strives to make no sense. A prince is depressed and the kingdom is mobilized to make him laugh. A spell is cast sending the Prince in pursuit of three oranges. An orange becomes a princess; a princess becomes a rat; a rat becomes a princess. The stage has an audience of its own whose members argue about what they are seeing and occasionally lend a hand in the action.</p>
        <p>Laughter in the opera house is like drops of water in the desert, and even the most hamhanded humor can set it off. Audiences eager to laugh along with the City Opera's ''Love of Three Oranges'' can legitimately do so. Mr. Corsaro's broad strokes and constant motion provide the right triggers. Those who must be persuaded to laugh will have a tougher time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sendak's Cook in Act II, a giant head with rolling eyes and wagging tongue, is a pleasure. The burlesque ballet sequence is equally nice. The players as a whole are eager comedians, but only Richard Troxell as the Prince has the requisite edge. Absurdity at its best depends on a kind of innocent dignity, and Mr. Troxell's addled solemnity had just that. Audiences that demand the original stroke or the powerful concept will manage a smile or two over the evening but not much more.</p>
        <p>The characters are many, and this cast does well. LeRoy Lehr, Matthew Chellis, Eduardo Chama, George Cordes, Linda Roarke-Strummer,  Kathryn Day, Cherry Duke and Kathleen Brett are among them. George Manahan conducted; the City Opera orchestra got through Prokofiev's cheerful, acid score without major mishap. ''The Love of Three Oranges'' plays next on Saturday afternoon.</p>
