        <p>Baseball's postseason ratings slide continued Tuesday when Game 6 of the American League Championship Series on NBC generated an 8.8 Nielsen rating.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' 9-7 victory over Seattle to win the A.L. pennant rated 43 percent lower than the 15.4 generated a year ago for NBC when Atlanta won the National League pennant by beating the Mets in 11 innings.</p>
        <p>NBC's rating was hampered severely by the decision by 26 of its top affiliates to carry the third presidential debate. Network stations in major markets like Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Washington and St. Louis chose to show the debate over the game, which was shunted in those markets to the local PAX-TV network affiliate or an indepedent station. The ratings on the non-NBC stations were not included in NBC's rating for the game.</p>
        <p>Each national rating point represents 970,000 TV households.</p>
        <p>Kevin Sullivan, a spokesman for NBC Sports, insisted that NBC would have given its stations the option to carry the debate even if the network had a continuing stake in broadcasting baseball. Under a deal struck last month, Fox will be the sole broadcast network of baseball through 2006.</p>
        <p>Debate or not, Tuesday night's rating reflected the dismal state of baseball's playoff performance. NBC's 7.7 average rating for the six-game A.L.C.S. represents a 32 percent decline from the 11.3 for last year's N.L.C.S.</p>
        <p>The news was no better on Fox, which is televising the World Series. The Mets' clinching victory in the N.L.C.S. Monday night generated a 6.3 rating, down 34 percent from a last year when it carried the Yankees-Boston A.L.C.S.</p>
        <p>Fox's 6.2 five-game N.L.C.S. rating was down 33 percent from its 9.2 last year for the A.L.C.S. The combined Fox/NBC rating of a 7.0 is 32 percent below the 10.3 last year.</p>
        <p>Fox is hoping that without the debates and other networks' season premieres to depress ratings, the World Series will perform well. Last year's Yankees sweep of Atlanta on NBC produced a 16.0 rating.</p>
