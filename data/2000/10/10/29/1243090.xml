        <p>The L.P.G.A. split six matches with its Japanese counterpart yesterday for a 7-5 lead after two rounds in the $765,000 Cisco World Ladies Challenge in Narita, Japan.</p>
        <p>The L.P.G.A. needs five victories and a tie in 12 stroke-play matches today to keep alive its 16-year winning streak and win the title for the 20th time in 22 years.</p>
        <p>The team captain, Annika Sorenstam, a 23-time tournament winner, and Sophie Gustafson beat Akiko Fukushima and Kasumi Fujii, 63-71, at the 6,396-yard, par-72 Sosei Country Club course.</p>
        <p>Lorie Kane, who was last year's captain, and Se Ri Pak edged Kaori Higo and Hiromi Kobayashi, 67-68, while Cristie Kerr and Becky Iverson beat Junko Yasui and Orie Fujino, 64-70.</p>
        <p>Yuri Fudoh, this season's leading money winner in Japan, and Tseng Hsiu-feng outscored Rosie Jones and Sherri Steinhauer, 68-70.</p>
        <p>Aki Nakano and Ku Ok-hee defeated Carin Koch and Nancy Scranton, 63-68, while Midori Yoneyama and Aki Takamura led throughout en route to a 65-67 victory over Michele Redman and Charlotta Sorenstam.</p>
        <p>The first two rounds featured six four-ball stroke-play matches per day, while today's play consists of 12 individual stroke-play singles matches.</p>
        <p>ROOKIE LEADS ITALIAN OPEN: The European PGA Tour rookie Ian Poulter birdied five of the last seven holes yesterday at the Italian Open to take a three-stroke lead heading into the final round.</p>
        <p>Poulter's seven-under-par 65 dropped him to 18 under at the $830,000 tournament. Poulter, a 24-year-old Englishman, is battling for rookie of the year honors with Alastair Forsyth of Scotland, who did not make the cut here.</p>
        <p>Francisco Cea followed up Friday's course-record 63 with a 68 and is tied for second place. Ricardo Gonzalez, Van Phillips and Roger Wessels are also at 15 under.</p>
        <p>Gordon Brand Jr. carded a 66 and joins overnight co-leaders Elliot Boult and Richard Green another shot back.</p>
        <p>INMAN LEADS BY TWO SHOTS: Two-time defending champion Joe Inman shot a 3-under-par 68 yesterday and maintained a two-stroke lead over Mike McCullough in the SBC Senior Classic.</p>
        <p>Inman is trying to become the fifth player in Senior PGA Tour history to win the same tournament three consecutive years.</p>
        <p>McCullough's 68 left him at 7-under 135, one stroke in front of Larry Nelson, who had a 64, Jim Thorpe, who had a 66, and Stewart Ginn, who had a 67.</p>
        <p>Inman had three birdies at the 6,583-yard Wilshire Country Club course, including a 25-foot putt on No. 12.</p>
