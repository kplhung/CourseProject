        <p>Boston College 42, Rutgers 13</p>
        <p>William Green weaved through a strong wind and a weak Rutgers defense, rushing for 223 yards and 2 touchdowns as Boston College scored a 42-13 home victory yesterday.</p>
        <p>On a day when passes floated in gusts up to 35 miles an hour, the Eagles stayed on the ground and also got 94 yards rushing and 3 touchdowns from Cedric Washington.</p>
        <p>Coach Terry Shea of Rutgers said: ''The running game of Boston College did us in.''</p>
        <p>Boston College (5-3, 2-3 Big East) had one glaring lapse, allowing 10 points in the last 40 seconds of the second quarter as Rutgers (3-5, 0-5) closed to 21-13 at halftime. But the Eagles scored on their first two series of the second half.</p>
        <p>Green, one of the most highly recruited running backs in the East last year, built on his 225-yard rushing performance three weeks earlier against Connecticut. The Atlantic City resident had a shot at Phil Bennett's school record of 253 yards rushing but sat out much of the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Tim Hasselbeck threw three touchdown passes. Mike McMahon of Rutgers, second in the Big East in yards passing per game, was victimized by dropped passes as he completed just 13 of 36 for 171 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions.</p>
        <p>Penn State 27, Indiana 24</p>
        <p>Penn State, which had not won on the road this season, got two 39-yard field goals from Ryan Primanti, the second with 18 seconds left, to hold off the Hoosiers at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. Primanti, who had missed a 29-yarder earlier in the fourth quarter, made amends by hitting a 39-yarder with 8:54 left and then hitting the game-winner in the game's waning moments.</p>
        <p>Lehigh 21, Holy Cross 6</p>
        <p>Nico Carwll returned his second interception of the game 56 yards for a touchdown with less than three minutes to play to seal undefeated Lehigh's victory over Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. Phil Pleasant ran for 110 yards and 2 touchdowns and Lehigh's defense stopped Holy Cross three times inside its 25-yard line in the second half.</p>
        <p>Lehigh (7-0, 3-0 Patriot League) took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on Pleasant's 3-yard run after Carwll's first interception at the 30-yard line of Holy Cross (4-4, 1-2).</p>
        <p>Delaware 33  James Madison 14</p>
        <p>Matt Nagy threw for 232 yards and 3 touchdowns as Delaware extended its record unblemished against visiting James Madison.</p>
        <p>Nagy became Delaware's leader in career passing yards, and his first two touchdown passes helped the Blue Hens (8-0, 5-0 Atlantic 10) to a 17-point second-quarter lead that effectively buried the Dukes (5-3, 3-2).</p>
        <p>Richmond 28, Villanova 18</p>
        <p>Scott Fulton scored two touchdowns and D'Arcy Wills rushed for 151 yards as visiting Richmond (6-2, 4-1) defeated Villanova, breaking a team rushing record with 430 yards on 77 carries.</p>
        <p>Villanova (5-3, 3-2 Atlantic 10) running back Brian Westbrook finished with 256 all-purpose yards, including 103 yards rushing and a touchdown on 14 carries.</p>
        <p>C.W. Post 58  Southern Connecticut 14</p>
        <p>In Brookville, N.Y., Ian Smart set a school record with six touchdown runs as C.W. Post beat Southern Connecticut for its sixth straight victory.</p>
        <p>Smart, with 166 yards on 16 carries, had scoring runs of 5, 3, 21, 61, 20 and 1 for Post (5-1 Eastern Football Conference, 6-1). He surpassed the five rushing scores accomplished twice by Joe Brusca in 1994.</p>
        <p>Sacred Heart 46, Iona 7</p>
        <p>Marvin Royal ran for a school-record 302 yards and 4 touchdowns to lead Sacred Heart's romp over Iona in Fairfield, Conn. Sacred Heart (8-0) opened the scoring with a nine-minute, 99-yard drive.</p>
        <p>IN OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>Russ Abrams kicked a 40-yard field goal with 10:52 left to lift COLGATE over visiting LAFAYETTE in a game marked by seven turnovers, 17-14. . . . Jamal Lambert scored on a 77-yard interception return as ST. JOHN'S halted visiting LA SALLE's five-game winning streak, 28-2. . . . Marquel Blackwell ran for a touchdown and threw for another as SOUTH FLORIDA beat CONNECTICUT, 21-13, at Storrs for its first victory over a Division I-A team. . . . BUCKNELL's Lucas Phillips completed 20 of 34 passes for 194 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 27-13 victory over visiting FORDHAM.</p>
