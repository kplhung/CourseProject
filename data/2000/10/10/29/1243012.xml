        <p>China's president, enraged by journalists' aggressive questions, lashed out at the Hong Kong news media on Friday, calling it naive.</p>
        <p>''You are very familiar with Western ways, but you are too young,'' said the president, Jiang Zemin, after he was pressed on whether Beijing had endorsed a second term for Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.

        <p>China's president, enraged by journalists' aggressive questions, lashed out at the Hong Kong news media on Friday, calling it naive.</p>
        <p>''You are very familiar with Western ways, but you are too young,'' said the president, Jiang Zemin, after he was pressed on whether Beijing had endorsed a second term for Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa. ''You go everywhere to follow the big news, but the questions you ask are too simple -- sometimes naive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jiang's angry remarks reverberated today as journalists, politicians and scholars debated his motive and meaning. Three years after this former British colony reverted to China, Hong Kong still looks for signs that Beijing pulls the reins.</p>
        <p>On Thursday China's deputy prime minister, Qian Qichen, appeared to endorse a second term for Mr. Tung, a former shipping magnate who was elected in 1996. Martin Lee, a pro-democracy politician, said those comments confirmed suspicions that Hong Kong has little say over who leads it.</p>
        <p>China watchers said it was unlikely that Mr. Qian, a seasoned diplomat, misspoke. But Mr. Jiang insisted that Beijing had not committed itself to Mr. Tung. ''Succession will take place according to the law in Hong Kong -- right or not?'' Mr. Jiang said. ''Of course, our decision power is also important.''</p>
        <p>Whatever message Mr. Jiang intended, it was lost in the fireworks, with the spectacle of the leader of the last Communist empire lecturing Hong Kong's freewheeling news media about how to do their job.</p>
        <p>Journalists here said the news media had done their job -- using a photo opportunity with Mr. Jiang and Mr. Tung to question the Chinese leader. Mr. Jiang expressed general support of Mr. Tung, but became angry after a television reporter pressed him on whether he favored a second term. Mr. Tung watched with a frozen smile.</p>
        <p>''Our job is to tell the public what the government's policy is,'' said Mak Yin-ting, the chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. ''We don't mind whether the leaders like our questions or not.''</p>
