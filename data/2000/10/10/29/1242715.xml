        <p>FROM the delighted squeals on the second floor of Bloomingdale's here, one would have thought that a girls' camp reunion was under way.</p>
        <p>Not exactly.</p>
        <p>It was the fourth annual Shopping Benefit, a 12-hour charity event that drew 3,500 shoppers. And there was definitely a party spirit as friends, neighbors and acquaintances from the soccer field and P.T.A. meetings kept running into one another.</p>
        <p>In exchange for a $10 ticket, shoppers get 15 percent off everything in the store, except for cosmetics and fragrances.</p>
        <p>''This is our biggest shopping day, after the two Saturdays just before Christmas,'' said Richard Mast, vice  president and general manager of the White Plains Bloomingdale's. ''The synergy is perfect. The idea is 'give a little, get a lot.' ''</p>
        <p>About 40 nonprofit organizations benefit from the $10 tickets that they sell before the event, with charities receiving an additional $5 for each shopper who presents a pre-sold ticket at the door. Then the receipts from tickets sold at the door are distributed among the charities that have sold at least 200 tickets before the event. This year, 6,111 tickets were sold.</p>
        <p>Combining two strong instincts, consuming and doing good, the Shopping Benefit has become a social ritual for many county residents who come out not only to support their favorite charities and complete their fall wardrobes, but to encounter familiar faces as well.</p>
        <p>As Staci Rahamin said: ''This is a field trip. Five friends from Armonk went together. And then we met two friends from Chappaqua.''</p>
        <p>Or take Eugenie Gingold, who was accompanied by her friend, Elizabeth Weinfeld, and met some mothers of her former nursery school students, ''now in their 20's,'' from Temple Beth El in New Rochelle.</p>
        <p>Bloomingdale's called 25,000 of its best customers, and mailed out an additional 30,000 invitations to frequent shoppers, so it was no surprise that the relentless beeping of the computerized cash registers was background music most of the day. Some 50 customers had even been waiting outside Bloomingdale's before the doors opened at 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>The event attracted serious shoppers like Marla Hoffman of Armonk, who already had three well-stuffed bags in her possession before 10:30. ''I figured it was for a good cause,'' she said, ''and I'd be getting the 15 percent discount.''</p>
        <p>And then, of course, there were those bewildered customers who had expected a quiet Tuesday morning to get some shopping done.</p>
        <p>''I just came to shop,'' said Susan W. Wagner from White Plains. ''I didn't know this was going on.''</p>
