        <p>This being an election year, it might be worthwhile for the Giants to move a little toward the center.</p>
        <p>It might be the best way to ensure victory.</p>
        <p>There are all kinds of offensive football canons, but one of the more time-honored ones is that good passing teams work the middle of the field. It is something the stumbling Giants offense has not done for weeks.</p>
        <p>Today, against the aggressive, blitzing Philadelphia Eagles, it may be more appropriate than ever. But it requires a certain daredevil mind-set from your wide receivers. As Giants receiver Joe Jurevicius said last week: ''When you go over the middle, you know you're going to get hit and it's probably going to hurt. So you might as well catch the ball. Besides, the more and more you do it, the more you become comfortable that you'll probably be able to get up and walk away from it.''</p>
        <p>Jurevicius even plans his after-the-catch behavior as he prepares to head into the middle of the field, where opposing safeties and linebackers await, hidden on the receiver's blindside.</p>
        <p>''Even if it hurts, get up before the defender and don't let him see that you're hurt,'' Jurevicius said as he sat at his locker Friday. ''If you feel that bad, then run to the sideline, get back behind everybody else and then fall down. Just don't let him see you.''</p>
        <p>At 6 feet 5 inches and 230 pounds, Jurevicius may be the team's best middle-of-the-field downfield threat. Against Dallas in the Giants' last game, Jurevicius made a pivotal fourth-quarter catch in the game-winning drive on a slant over the middle. As he pulled the ball in, he took a crunching hit from Cowboys linebacker Dat Nguyen.</p>
        <p>True to his word, Jurevicius got up right away. Nguyen was moving more gingerly, having separated his left shoulder on the play.</p>
        <p>It was one of the rare Giants pass plays in a month of games that has exploited the seams and gaps usually found in the center of a defense's coverages. Not by design but perhaps by preference, the Giants' passing game was drifted to the edges of the field. Most pass routes have been squareouts and curls, or fades and stop-and-go routes down the sideline.</p>
        <p>With Giants tight end Pete Mitchell missing some early games because of injury and illness, the team's tight ends, who customarily work the middle, have caught just nine passes -- five by Mitchell, three by Dan Campbell and one by the starter Howard Cross.</p>
        <p>The last time the Giants used the middle of the field extensively, it was against the Eagles in the second game of the season, when Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard caught touchdown passes on patterns to the deep middle of the field. The Giants, who won in a 33-18 rout, were able to get behind the Philadelphia safeties, taking advantage of the Eagles' aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>Faced with the favorable defensive matchups, it might be a useful strategy again today. It helps if you are running the football effectively, something the Giants emphasized in their victory over Dallas. With Ron Dayne carrying the football, that is very likely to again be a focal point for the Giants.</p>
        <p>Jurevicius and the tight ends are hardly the only Giants receivers willing to venture into the middle of the field. Though Toomer seems most comfortable outside, he has caught a number of slant passes. Hilliard, though only 195 pounds, routinely dashes inside.</p>
        <p>''It's my role in this offense,'' Hilliard said. ''It is a different game in there. You've got linebackers and safeties bearing down on you. Sometimes you just can't see them all coming.''</p>
        <p>As a rookie starter in 1997, Hilliard made the second reception of his National Football League career on a deep pass over the middle. He caught the ball sliding on his knees, and took a hit from Jacksonville safety Chris Hudson that snapped his head back.</p>
        <p>Hilliard quickly hopped from the ground to his feet, but wobbled to the sideline. He did not play again that season, requiring spinal stabilization surgery for a serious neck ligament sprain between his sixth and seventh vertebrae.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot more bodies in the middle,'' said Hilliard, who has 154 career receptions since 1997 and leads the Giants with 31 catches this season. ''But some people say the middle is the safest part of the field. There are a lot of voids in the defense.''</p>
        <p>For the Giants, a void dragging down their offense appears to be the lack of production in the center of the field where a bigger target, like Jurevicius, can be a weapon. It is also a place where the shifty, darting Hilliard can be effective after a catch. Mitchell, plagued by injuries, was brought to the Giants for his savvy finding gaps just off the scrum near the center of the line of scrimmage.</p>
        <p>''Working the middle of the field is part of every game plan every week,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ''But it depends what the defense is giving you, too.''</p>
        <p>Teams scouting the Giants, however, will see the pattern of an outside passing game and adjust. To that end, if Fassel's offense is going to improve, or even flourish, the Giants may have to elect to resurrect their middle-of-the-field pass game.</p>
        <p>Knowing it plays to his strength, Jurevicius gave it his endorsement.</p>
        <p>''It's got my vote,'' he said.</p>
