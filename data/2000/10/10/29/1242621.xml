        <p>IN 1521 on a trip from Bruges to Cologne, the German artist Albrecht Durer handled transactions in 18 different currencies that included stuivers, anglots, orrts, and weisspfennigs.

        <p>IN 1521 on a trip from Bruges to Cologne, the German artist Albrecht Durer handled transactions in 18 different currencies that included stuivers, anglots, orrts, and weisspfennigs. His pockets bulging with masses of mismatched coins, he probably never knew how much he was really paying for his rooms at the inn.</p>
        <p>Half a millennium later, in a radically transformed Europe, virtual euros have simplified financial transactions to the point of boredom, while credit cards have very nearly eliminated the use of currency. During a recent year abroad, as my husband and I traveled through a Europe rife with cash machines and money changers, paying our bills was simple and straightforward.  Tipping was a different matter.</p>
        <p>You see, we, like many Americans, are intent -- no, obsessed -- with doing the right thing when we travel abroad. We speak quietly in restaurants, we dress tastefully, and we drink local wines. But when it comes to leaving a tip, our savoir-faire abandons us and we become mired in self-doubt. Ten percent? Fifteen percent? Eighteen percent? And what if the service is already included? If we leave too little we'll seem cheap and small-minded, but leave too much and, worse still, we'll be taken for arrogant industrialists, skimming the cream off foreign nations, profiteering from currency imbalances, and flaunting our imperialist economy.</p>
        <p>I should confess that even in the United States I do not feel comfortable in the role of Lady Bountiful. I mostly lug my bags through hotel lobbies. ''No, please don't worry,'' I assure distressed porters as I huff and puff, ''They're practically empty.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, my husband, David, a college professor, finds that his ability to calculate simple percentages abandons him the moment his taxi pulls over to the curb. ''How much did you tip?'' I asked him in New York after a lengthy cab ride from La Guardia airport. David paused for a moment of deep concentration. ''About 90 percent,'' he finally calculated.</p>
        <p>But in Europe, the problem goes beyond simple math to issues of self-esteem and intercultural relations. Indeed, we found on our recent sojourn that the symbolism and expectations surrounding tipping were as varied and capricious as the coinage in Durer's time.</p>
        <p>Britain, for starters, has so many inconsistencies and variations associated with gratuities that there was actually a bill before Parliament several years ago to try and impose some sort of national norm. The basic confusion arises from a ''voluntary tip'' that restaurant managers sometimes, but not always, add to bills. In theory you don't have to pay it, but more often people mistake it for some sort of cocktail or dessert and leave yet another tip -- thus increasing the cost of the dinner by about 35 percent. It didn't take long before we were on to this ruse. But that was just the beginning.</p>
        <p>''You've got to be kidding,'' a British friend exclaimed, when David tried to leave the barman an extra pound for our pints of ale. ''You don't tip at a pub.''</p>
        <p>When we explained that we didn't want to seem like ugly Americans, our friend elaborated: ''It's like, you know, McDonald's. Surely you don't leave a tip at a burger joint.'' Instead we simply bought another round.</p>
        <p>It is well and good, of course, for our British friend to outline local tipping customs -- ''Tip a cabby? Are you out of your mind? They make more than I do'' -- but for better or worse Americans travel the world with a national identity: very rich. Never mind that the current rate of exchange on the pound makes most Americans in Britain wince each time they pull out their pocket calculators. A century ago, Americans larded with the wealth of the Gilded Age bought castles with bank drafts. Today, times have changed but the sins of those robber barons will be forever visited upon the sons and daughters of the middle class. Call it, if you will, the national debt.</p>
        <p>In Italy, the tipping situation is both byzantine and baroque. There is the puzzling but quaint coperto, or, literally, the place setting, which is the fee charged for the clean napkin and tablecloth that may seem like a bargain to anyone who has paid to have a shirt laundered at an Italian hotel. It also functions as an ad hoc service charge, but this is merely the beginning. My Italian friends tell me to leave an additional 4,000 or 5,000 lire a head if the service hasn't already been added into the bill.</p>
        <p>But who without graduate work in cryptography can tell whether the scribbled bill we've been presented includes service, much less if it bears any relationship to the meal we have just consumed? One could ask the waiter for clarification, as we once did, only to learn that, well, yes, a service charge had been added but the manager was going to pocket all of it and, moreover, the waiter himself was very underpaid and had small children at home. And what do you do if the waiter, choosing a different tack, presents a frosty limoncello as offerto dalla casa (on the house)? Surely then you should leave a bit more. Of course, given the instant numbing effects of this Amalfitano potion, one tends in these situations to ignore the bottom line altogether.</p>
        <p>Coffee bars? Place 200 lire on the counter to ensure that the barman doesn't scald your milk. (Quite a deal for 10 cents!) Autogrill (a k a service station) restrooms? Tip generously -- even if the matron snarls. A clean facility is priceless.</p>
        <p>For the most part we followed our friends' advice, generally more economical than our guidebook recommendations, and hoped that we would appear more Roman. But with our flat vowels and mushy consonants it's more likely that we merely seemed cheap.</p>
        <p>The border between France and Italy has traditionally been somewhat fluid. Garibaldi, the father of modern Italy, was actually from Nice, while even today many Milanese prefer crepes and souffles to pasta.</p>
        <p>But cross that border and the ''coperto'' evaporates, ''servizio'' becomes ''service'' and the cards are laid out for all to see: it is either ''compris,'' which means no additional charges will be applied, or ''non compris,'' which means a service charge will be added to the bill. In other words, they've taken the guesswork out of settling one's accounts. Or so it would seem.</p>
        <p>IN Alsace, after a particularly memorable meal, we paid by credit card. No service charge was added to our substantial bill and, as a truly gracious touch, our waiter had drawn a line through the gratuity space on the credit card slip.</p>
        <p>We thanked him profusely and, having noted the ''service compris'' printed on the bottom of the menu, we left nothing. On the way to our car, ever nervous and perplexed, we asked a French couple whether we had done the right thing.</p>
        <p>''The service is compris,'' the husband explained, ''but at a restaurant such as this''  -- eyebrows raise and voice lowers -- ''we leave something extra.'' Clearly we had failed.</p>
        <p>A day later and several thousand meters  higher, we were lunching in Murren, a ski resort in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me,'' David asked a Swiss couple at the next table, ''do you tip in Switzerland?'' Yes, our insecurities had become clinical.</p>
        <p>''We don't tip in our country,'' the young man explained. ''The meals are expensive already, but that's all we pay.''</p>
        <p>After months of such excruciating postprandial uncertainty, we were overwhelmed with a novel sense of well-being. David paid our waiter who in turn counted the exact change from a well-worn leather pouch strapped to his waist. With no complicated percentages, no existential soul searching and no mental math, we pocketed our delightful Swiss coins and headed back to the slopes.</p>
        <p>Never mind the exorbitant sum we'd paid for our chicken and potatoes. The transaction had been as clean and precise as a Swiss watch.</p>
