        <p>I very much enjoyed Frank Rich's theater reminiscence (Oct. 8). His article evoked, for me, my own early memories of Broadway. As a native New Yorker, I was fortunate to be able to see a show every weekend. In 1963, my uncle, Bill Ross, was a Broadway stage manager (he was then working on ''110 in the Shade''), who later became a producer and director. Every weekend, my cousin Anita and I would go to acting school in a building across from the Dakota. After class, my uncle would call one of his theater buddies, and we would slip in to see a show that might have some extra seats. Or we would pay the $2 or $3 that tickets cost then to sit in the balcony. We saw everything -- musicals, dramas, brilliant shows and lemons. I immersed myself in a world that, at the time, I so much wanted to be a part of.</p>
        <p>Thank you for bringing back to me the experience of losing myself in the dark, special, fantastic world of the Broadway stage.</p>
