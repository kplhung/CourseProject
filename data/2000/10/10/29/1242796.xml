        <p>Book him has a new meaning these days in this upscale Bergen County town.</p>
        <p>After all, not every police station can claim to have a mural of Alice in Wonderland over the desk officer sitting behind what used to be the circulation desk.</p>
        <p>Blame it all on Hurricane Floyd.</p>
        <p>The police department used to be in the basement of Village Hall on the edge of the central business district. But last September rapidly rising water from the Ho-Ho-Kus Brook flowed several hundred yards across a ballfield, rose against the doors and shattered a window. Soon everyone was chest high in water that soaked computers, destroyed records.</p>
        <p>Ridgewood's acting police chief, William Corcoran,  even recalls an enormous soda machine floating by in the murky darkness like a toy boat in a bathtub.</p>
        <p>The Board of Health was relocated to a trailer next door, but the police and emergency services moved to the west side to the George L. Pease Library, a 1920's Italian Renaissance Revival building with chestnut fireplaces, hand-painted murals, second-floor balconies and a skylight.</p>
        <p>But people -- and not necessarily those suspected of D.U.I. -- began arriving at the former police station and finding themselves asking, ''Car 54, where are you?''</p>
        <p>Almost immediately a sign went up near the Village Hall explaining where the police had relocated.</p>
        <p>''Oh what a beautiful building,'' Chief Corcoran says. ''We've put green lights outside like an old-time police station. It's an absolutely gorgeous building, only it's too small.''</p>
        <p>And there is still some confusion, though it has waned somewhat as the months have passed.</p>
        <p>''The first six months, some people would come in and say, 'Where's Pease Library?' '' said Rich Scalione, the village electrician, as he carried a spool of electric wire into the gutted basement of Village Hall where jail bars lay flat on the cement floor. ''Now, rarely,'' he added. ''Very rarely.''</p>
        <p>People sometimes still drop into Pease to pay a summons but learn the violations bureau is still at Village Hall. ''We have to tell them to go back,'' said Officer James Youngberg, the desk officer.</p>
        <p>Village Manager Larry D. Worth says there have also been some coordination glitches. ''It becomes a big deal just to have a meeting,'' Mr. Worth said. ''You almost have to schedule it rather than seeing the chief in the hallway. You lose a little bit of communication.''</p>
        <p>Worst of all, the move by the 45-member department to Pease Library, which is situated between two apartment buildings, across from the train station and near stores and a profusion of restaurants, made a bad parking situation even worse.</p>
        <p>''The two biggest problems over there are that the space isn't large enough to accommodate the department and the other is the location,'' said Mayor Jane Reilly.</p>
        <p>A dozen metered parking spaces on Library Place near the police station were taken over for official use. Department employees park their private vehicles in a lot reserved for them several blocks away.</p>
        <p>For the public on police business, three spaces are reserved at the train station but are not obvious when you're driving by. Even before the police came to the area, two parking lots for a bank's use became off limits to apartment residents who parked there when the bank was closed.</p>
        <p>Lori Van Overloop, owner of Nature's Market Place, a health foods store, said a video store and a camera store went out of business because of parking woes. And although town officials gave back four metered spaces on Library Place and added some across Ridgewood Avenue, her customers still complain.</p>
        <p>''It chased some people away for good,'' Ms. Van Overloop said. ''They say, 'I drive around the block and if nothing opens up I go somewhere else.' That's not something you want to hear.''</p>
        <p>Chief Corcoran said the department had tried to be accommodating. Officers have been ''lenient'' with parking tickets.</p>
        <p>For the police, adapting a library into a police station while preserving its architectural integrity has not been easy. Temporary offices had to be erected without causing damage to walls and chestnut beams. Departments are crammed here and there and officers have little locker space. A 10-foot by 9-foot holding cell and booking station was built of cyclone fencing underneath a balcony but violent prisoners are sent to the jail in neighboring Glen Rock. Detectives sit on a balcony above the holding cell.</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult to have a private conversation,'' Chief Corcoran said. ''I have a lot of impromptu conversations out in the front walkway.''</p>
        <p>It could be two years before the department moves into a permanent home. Village officials have done a  study and plan to build a $2.6 million annex to house the police next to Village Hall, said Mr. Worth.</p>
        <p>It will be built on higher ground.</p>
