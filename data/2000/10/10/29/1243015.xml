        <p>Oakland Raiders' player Tyrone Wheatley is part of mini-trend in NFL: running backs once though of as malcontents or has-beens who have had their careers rejuvenated; other running backs discussed include Pittsburgh Steelers' Jerome Bettis, Dallas Cowboys' Emmitt Smith, Detroit Lions' James Stewart, New York Giants' Tiki Barber and New Orleans Saints' Ricky Williams; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The oddity of his situation is never lost on Oakland Raiders running back Tyrone Wheatley.

        <p>The oddity of his situation is never lost on Oakland Raiders running back Tyrone Wheatley. When he was with the Giants, Wheatley used to joke that he was the most expensive scout-team player in history. He was as maligned a draft pick as the organization had ever seen. Two years later, few running backs are playing better or running harder. Some opponents have actually said that his punishing style is intimidating.</p>
        <p>Wheatley is enjoying his success in Oakland, and what is not to like? The Raiders are 6-1 and on their way to winning the American Football Conference West. Wheatley has 5 touchdowns in his last 4 games, and 11 in his last 10 games. This season, he has run for 468 yards and 6 touchdowns and has caught 16 passes for 137 yards and a touchdown. Last Sunday, he had 156 yards and a touchdown against the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
        <p>Great numbers. Great attitude. Great work ethic. That is what the Raiders are saying about Wheatley. Oakland is also asking anyone with a spare minute or two: Why did the Giants, and subsequently the Miami Dolphins, ever let him go?</p>
        <p>The two coaching staffs for whom Wheatley played in New York were equally frustrated by Wheatley's nonconformist style. Every move he made was examined under a microscope until the parties reached a breaking point.</p>
        <p>Wheatley fits in perfectly with the Raiders, who could care less about his past. His career turnaround is one of the best stories in the league thus far. But every now and then, Wheatley, the Giants' first-round pick in 1995 from Michigan, looks back at his experience with the team and cannot help having a few hard feelings.</p>
        <p>''One thing that still irritates me is that when I look around the league, I see how well No. 1 draft picks are treated,'' said Wheatley, who was with the Giants from 1995 to 1998. ''They are allowed to make mistakes and be human beings without being criticized by the team over every little thing. I never had that kind of understanding from the Giants.''</p>
        <p>Wheatley was sometimes fined for being several pounds overweight, while others, like the former Giants running back Gary Brown, were not. ''I think the other thing you see with the Raiders is there are not a lot of double standards with players,'' Wheatley said. ''Once, when I was with the Giants, I was stuck in traffic on Route 17 and I was late for a meeting. Another player was stuck in the same traffic in a different car. We were both late. But I was fined and he wasn't.''</p>
        <p>Wheatley added: ''I can name five starters from some of the Giants teams I played on who had serious problems. There were players who came to practice drunk, had D.U.I.'s and other problems. But I was always portrayed as the bad guy, and I never did anything like that.''</p>
        <p>Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi declined to comment on Wheatley's specific allegations, but did say that trading Wheatley ''was a very tough decision; he was a good player.''</p>
        <p>Wheatley is part of an interesting mini-trend in the N.F.L. Some of the best running backs are veterans who were once viewed as malcontents or has-beens. Those players, their careers rejuvenated, are now leading their teams toward the playoffs.</p>
        <p>In Pittsburgh, Jerome Bettis was criticized for his lack of durability. This season, he has 628 rushing yards (including four 100-yard games) and 6 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>In Dallas, Emmitt Smith has repeatedly heard over the past few seasons how he has lost a step. But Smith is on the verge of his 10th consecutive 1,000-yard season.</p>
        <p>In Detroit, James Stewart was seen as injury-prone when he was with the Jacksonville Jaguars, but he needs only 21 yards to surpass the Lions' team rushing leader from last season, Greg Hill, who had 542 yards.</p>
        <p>In New York, the Giants' Tiki Barber struggled early in his career. Now he leads the conference's third-best rushing attack.</p>
        <p>New Orleans's Ricky Williams has heard more than his share of criticism since the Saints traded their entire 1999 draft to select him in the first round. Williams has been called moody and a poor team player.</p>
        <p>He is still a bit eccentric. Sports Illustrated reported that Williams was fined $3,051 last week for skipping a doctor's appointment to check his bruised right knee. Before the Atlanta game on Oct. 22, Coach Jim Haslett told Williams he might ask him to carry the football 40 times, words most running backs would love to hear. Williams replied, ''Please don't.''</p>
        <p>But Williams is producing on the field. He has rushed for a club-record five consecutive 100-yard games. His 184 rushing attempts are second in the league behind Washington's Stephen Davis (191), and they illustrate that Williams has, at least for now, ended concerns about his toughness.</p>
        <p>For Wheatley and Williams, the lesson learned may be patience. ''I'm more comfortable than I've ever been,'' Wheatley said. ''I've been given another chance and I'm making the most of it.''</p>
        <p>Rams' Problems Grow</p>
        <p>The St. Louis Rams are going through a crisis, and it has nothing to do with losing quarterback Kurt Warner for at least a month because of a broken finger.</p>
        <p>Coach Mike Martz benched defensive end Kevin Carter and cornerback Todd Lyght for today's game against the San Francisco 49ers. Carter was extremely bitter about the benching, calling it foolish and stupid.</p>
        <p>Yet Carter is clearly not the same player he was last season when he went to the Pro Bowl. Scouts say his pass rush has lost its zip and his efforts against the run are mediocre at best.</p>
        <p>The challenge for Martz is keeping Lyght and Carter from becoming team cancers.</p>
        <p>Redskins Scold Ravens</p>
        <p>The Washington-Baltimore rivalry may have quieted down publicly, but behind the scenes it is just as intense. The Redskins received unfavorable news coverage after charging the Ravens to park their team buses before their Oct. 15 game at Washington. Last week, Redskins officials spoke in detail about the feud and defended themselves on several fronts.</p>
        <p>Baltimore team officials recently filed a complaint alleging that the Redskins violated league rules by, among other things, playing music or making announcements as the Ravens approached the line of scrimmage. Washington officials met with the league office last week to discuss those and other alleged violations -- the Redskins have been fined twice -- and how to correct them.</p>
        <p>The Redskins said they have never purposely violated any rule.</p>
        <p>Washington officials maintain that they are not upset with anyone in the Ravens' organization; last summer they helped Baltimore deal with a delicate tax issue.</p>
        <p>But clearly the Redskins are irritated with their neighbors. Washington's team president, Stephen T. Baldacci, recently sent a letter to his Baltimore counterpart, David Modell, and made it clear he was not happy with the Ravens' public airing of their grievances.</p>
        <p>The letter read in part: ''Going to the press achieves nothing. In the future, if issues arise, I would appreciate it if you would simply pick up the phone and call me and we will address them quietly and directly. Otherwise, formally complain at the league level. All your staff's comments have achieved at this stage is to tarnish the N.F.L. and portray the Washington Redskins in a negative manner.''</p>
        <p>Modell is writing a response.</p>
        <p>No Focus on Rivalries</p>
        <p>Possibly as early as next week, N.F.L. owners will approve a new scheduling format when the league expands to 32 teams in 2002. Fans may be disappointed to learn that, at least for now, potential realignment ideas are not focusing on regional rivalries.</p>
        <p>That means, for example, the new scheduling format will not include yearly Giants-Jets games.</p>
        <p>The problem that owners are discovering is that not every team -- such as Seattle or Carolina -- has a rival.</p>
        <p>Owners want no part of assigning rivalries.</p>
