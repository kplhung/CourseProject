        <p>Q. My landlord has just notified me of his ''intention to recover housing accommodation based upon owner's use.'' I have lived in my rent-stabilized apartment for 13 years. I don't believe that the landlord's intentions are in good faith since there has been a turnover of units in the building over the last several months and the landlord didn't move into any of those apartments when they became empty. Also, I am paying one of the lowest rents in the building. What should I do? Do I have a good chance of winning this case? . . . Paul Veneziano, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A. Colleen F. McGuire, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that under current law a landlord is permitted to evict a rent-stabilized tenant at the end of the tenant's lease if the landlord or his immediate family intends to reside in the apartment for at least the next three years. The term immediate family includes a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent or grandchild.</p>

        <p>Q. My landlord has just notified me of his ''intention to recover housing accommodation based upon owner's use.'' I have lived in my rent-stabilized apartment for 13 years. I don't believe that the landlord's intentions are in good faith since there has been a turnover of units in the building over the last several months and the landlord didn't move into any of those apartments when they became empty. Also, I am paying one of the lowest rents in the building. What should I do? Do I have a good chance of winning this case? . . . Paul Veneziano, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A. Colleen F. McGuire, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that under current law a landlord is permitted to evict a rent-stabilized tenant at the end of the tenant's lease if the landlord or his immediate family intends to reside in the apartment for at least the next three years. The term immediate family includes a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent or grandchild.</p>
        <p>The landlord, she said, must be a ''natural person'' and not a corporation, partnership or other business entity, and must notify the tenant between 150 and 120 days before the end of the lease term of the intention not to renew.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGuire said that there is nothing in the law that would require a landlord who wants to reclaim an apartment for personal use to settle for an apartment that happens to become vacant.</p>
        <p>''Landlords can choose the specific apartment they want to reside in regardless of whether other apartments are available or whether the targeted tenant has the lowest rent in the building,'' Ms. McGuire said.</p>
        <p>She added that if the targeted tenant is handicapped or 62 or older, the landlord is required to find the tenant an equivalent or better apartment at the same or lower regulated rent in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGuire said that one thing the letter writer may be able to do would be to refuse to vacate the apartment, forcing the landlord to take him to court. To win at trial, she said, the landlord would have to prove he has a good-faith intention to take the apartment for personal use.  If the landlord proves that, she said, the only way the tenant could win would be if the landlord or his immediate family failed to occupy the apartment for at least three years after the tenant left.</p>
        <p>Under current law, Ms. McGuire said, if the landlord does not occupy the apartment for the required time period he must offer the apartment back to the original tenant at the tenant's last rent. If the landlord does not do so, she said, he could forfeit any rent increases he would be entitled to for the entire building for up to three years.</p>
        <p>Divorce Judgments And Co-ops  Q. If a co-op that is being sold is in the name of one individual, but there is a divorce judgment stating that the proceeds of the sale must be divided equally between that person and a former spouse, does the divorce judgment have to be disclosed to the buyer? If not, how would the person whose name is not on the title protect his or her interest? . . .  Roseann Feaser, Staten Island.</p>
        <p>A. Harold Lubell, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the existence of a divorce judgment would not have to be disclosed to a buyer because the judgment itself does not constitute a lien on the property.</p>
        <p>It is possible, however, Mr. Lubell said, for the judgment to contain a provision allowing the person whose name is not on the co-op stock certificates to place a lien on the apartment by filing what is known as a uniform commercial code financing statement.</p>
        <p>Though such a provision would be fairly uncommon, he said, it would provide protection for the individual whose name is not on the stock certificate, because the lien would be found by the buyer's lawyer when the lawyer conducted a standard lien search.</p>
        <p>Other than that, however, Mr. Lubell said, the only way the individual whose name is not on the stock certificate could be assured of getting a share of the proceeds would be to take the ex-spouse back to the court that issued the original order.</p>
