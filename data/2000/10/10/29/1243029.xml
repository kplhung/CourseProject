        <p>The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, faced down a severe challenge from within his badly divided Protestant party and narrowly held on to the leadership today, in a vote seen as crucial to the survival of the Northern Ireland peace settlement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble was able to stave off a challenge from Jeffrey Donaldson, who opposes the peace accord, only after adopting a far harder line toward remaining in a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.</p>
        <p>The balloting in a vote of confidence was the fifth time this year that the party's 860-strong ruling council had gathered in Belfast to weigh a challenge to Mr. Trimble, who is also first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly and has become intimately identified with the 1998 peace agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble defeated a proposal from within his party to withdraw from the power-sharing government if the I.R.A. did not begin disarming by the end of November. He submitted a counterproposal laying out tactical sanctions to be imposed gradually as a way of forcing the guerrilla army to destroy its arsenal.</p>
        <p>One of the delegates, Arnold Hatch, called it ''the tourniquet approach, where bit by bit the pressure is put on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble's motion won the support of 54 percent of the 819 voting delegates.</p>
        <p>Two measures in Mr. Trimble's amended approach were to deny Sinn Fein representatives the necessary nominations for them to take part in the so-called North-South bodies, which bring ministers from the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly together, and to demand that the international disarmament panel headed by Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada become more aggressive in its effort to confiscate and destroy paramilitaries' weapons.</p>
        <p>The Trimble motion also said the party would meet to review progress on disarmament in January, in effect setting up a timetable of his own.</p>
        <p>Following the vote, Mr. Trimble played down his differences with Mr. Donaldson, which had led to sharp personal exchanges in the past week. ''The debate showed that the differences between Jeffrey and myself were essentially tactical,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donaldson said that though the outcome went against him, the party had largely followed his lead. ''David Trimble has moved onto our ground,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A growing number of dissidents in the party object to the failure of the I.R.A. to begin disarming at a time when its political representatives now occupy ministerial positions in the new home-rule government.</p>
        <p>They are also protesting proposals before the British Parliament to change the name, symbols and makeup of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which Catholic politicians have characterized as an occupation force. The constabulary is 93 percent Protestant, and Catholics make up 43 percent of the province's population.</p>
        <p>Fresh electoral politics and the emergence of a serious contender for Mr. Trimble's party leadership increased pressures at today's closed meeting, in Waterfront Hall in Belfast. The party lost a seat in the British Parliament in a by-election last month to the hard-line Democratic Unionist party of the Rev. Ian Paisley, and Mr. Donaldson has warned that the Unionists will lose more seats in the national election, expected in May, unless the party gets tougher with its Catholic rivals.</p>
        <p>Tensions in the quarrelsome party broke out in public this past week as Mr. Donaldson pressed his own eight-point strategic plan for hardening the party's position and Mr. Trimble dismissed it as ''a letter to Santa.'' Mr. Trimble argued that setting explicit deadlines was simplistic and would tie his hands in future negotiations.</p>
        <p>Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, warned Friday that demanding action by particular dates would collapse the entire agreement.</p>
        <p>''If the Unionist council meets and places deadlines,'' he said, ''and makes the process conditional upon the I.R.A. doing certain things within a certain time-frame set by the council, then what they are doing is setting the self-destruct button for the process on red alert.''</p>
        <p>Sinn Fein can be expected to argue vigorously against the proposal today to keep its ministers from attending meetings with their Dublin counterparts. The first such session is scheduled for Friday.</p>
        <p>In what was seen as an effort to throw Mr. Trimble a lifeline, the I.R.A. announced Thursday that secret arms dumps had been inspected for the second time by Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, the two international arms monitors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donaldson said the move did not amount to disarmament, which under the current agreement is supposed to occur by June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble conceded that the inspections did not constitute actual disarmament. But in a rare instance in Ulster's polarized public life of a politician asking followers to appreciate a view from the other side, he said, ''From the perspective of Republicans, the inspections are a huge step and the underlying direction to a lot of Republicans is clear.''</p>
        <p>In the last leadership test, Mr. Trimble was able to gain the backing of only 53 percent of the delegates, and in recent days he accused the anti-agreement delegates of ''waging constant warfare against the party over two and a half years.''</p>
        <p>In an open letter to party delegates in the Belfast News Letter today, Mr. Trimble said setting an earlier deadline would have the opposite effect of that put forward by the dissidents.</p>
        <p>''We must not allow ourselves to be talked out of this present opportunity to nail the I.R.A. once and for all,'' he said. ''Successive British governments failed to disband or disarm the I.R.A. We, however, have boxed the I.R.A. into a tactical, moral and political cul-de-sac.</p>
        <p>''The consequence of endorsing Jeffrey Donaldson's strategy will be the destruction of the Government of Northern Ireland. This party would remove itself from office, abandoning every gain, and be destined to return to the same political wilderness we inhabited for most of the past 30 years. That is not a strategy for success. That is a recipe for political and constitutional disaster.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble was given a boost on Friday in a poll in The Belfast Telegraph that showed 68 percent of the Ulster Unionist rank and file backing his desire to keep the party engaged in government and only 29 percent supporting Mr. Donaldson's leadership ambitions. The ruling council, with militant groups like the Orange Order voting in blocs, is more conservative than the party as a whole.</p>
        <p>He also received some shoring up from Prime Minister Tony Blair, who paid an emergency visit to Belfast to meet with political leaders and to announce new military contracts for Belfast's biggest shipyard.</p>
        <p>Peter Mandelson, Northern Ireland Secretary for Mr. Blair, warned that if the vote went against Mr. Trimble, the home-rule government would come to an end, direct rule from London would be restored and Britain would permit Dublin a far greater say in the affairs of the North than Protestants would want.</p>
