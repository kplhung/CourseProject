        <p>To: My Successor  From: Bill Clinton  Date: Nov. 8, 2000</p>
        <p>Congratulations on your victory. My bequest to you is the best economy that any of us has ever known, a testament either to the righteousness of my policies or my exquisitely fortuitous timing. (We'll let history sort that one out.)</p>
        <p>In any case, here's your first top-secret briefing as president-elect: The good times probably won't last.</p>
        <p>I'm not trying to put a damper on your celebration. But let's face it: no winning streak goes on forever, and even with Alan Greenspan working his magic, this expansion is vulnerable on a number of fronts.</p>
        <p>So if you don't want to be a one-term president, you had better start thinking about where the economic danger will lurk during your watch.</p>
        <p>Here are three topics that, however arcane they sound, may soon be keeping you awake at night: the current account deficit, the possibility that the long boom in capital spending will come to a halt, and the likelihood that the current budget surpluses will give way to another era of deficits.</p>
        <p>The current account -- a broad measure of the balance of trade and the flow of capital across borders -- is running a huge deficit. This year, it has been more than 4 percent of the gross domestic product, the largest by far among the big industrial countries and well above its last peak of 3.4 percent during the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>In a sense, the current account deficit is an indicator of strength. The economy is expanding faster than those of our major trading partners, so imports are surging while export growth has been sluggish. Moreover, capital has cascaded into the United States because rates of return here have been high, both from the stock market and from direct investments like the acquisition of companies or the construction of new factories.</p>
        <p>In this new, productivity-enhanced economy, no one knows how big the current account deficit can grow before the United States encounters trouble. But at some point the deficit will become unsustainable.</p>
        <p>Here's the possibility that generates sweaty palms at Treasury and the Fed: Foreign investors judge the United States to be losing its economic edge. They suddenly become nervous about the current account and cut off the flow of new money into the country. The dollar plummets, inflation accelerates and the Fed responds by pushing up interest rates, choking off growth.</p>
        <p>How do we address the problem? By encouraging more robust growth in Japan and Europe, and by shoring up our own national balance sheet through continued reduction of the national debt and increased levels of private savings. As you'll soon find out, those things are easier said than done.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important characteristic of this expansion has been the high rate of growth in capital spending. The growth reflects the successful drive by corporations to squeeze out costs and improve productivity, and accounts for a substantial chunk of total demand in the economy.</p>
        <p>Companies have enjoyed high rates of return on capital spending because they have been able to borrow money cheaply. But now interest rates for corporate borrowers are rising. At the same time, profit growth is slowing, as is overall economic growth.</p>
        <p>Many forces, including global competition, are still pressuring companies to continue to invest in new equipment, but it is now clear that the rate of increase is slowing. A continued slowdown could have outsized effects on economic growth, and on the outlook for corporate profits and for Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Through its effects ''on productivity growth and ultimately on the level of stock prices, the capital spending boom has been responsible for a significant part of the growth in consumer spending in recent years,'' said a recent study by Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.</p>
        <p>''In short, if the boom were to end,'' the study added, ''this could undermine the virtuous cycle that has driven U.S. growth over the past decade.''</p>
        <p>The economy's recent strength has been underpinned by big budget surpluses and reduction of the national debt. But guess what? The surplus is shrinking already, and that's not even the real problem.</p>
        <p>Even if all the positive forces that have generated surpluses for the last few years remain intact for another decade, the government's fiscal condition is going to take a wrenching turn for the worse starting around 2015, as we confront the bill from the aging of the baby-boom generation. The prospect of huge budget deficits lies just over the horizon.</p>
        <p>I'm heading off into early retirement myself. Do me a favor and help me make it a prosperous and secure dotage.</p>
