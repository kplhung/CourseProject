        <p>WHEN far-off lands were new and hard to comprehend, 19th-century photographers sometimes recreated them, making them look more familiar, more like home. So British photograhers in India found angles that made the Indian landscape look like British picturesque painting; European photographers portrayed Chinese in poses that looked at home in the West; Europeans in Africa made group portraits of tribes that mimicked Western pictures of business or social organizations and nudes that resembled erotic tropes in painting and illustration. The tendency to convert an unknown experience into an artistic echo of safe cultural practices was a corollary of colonialism and in itself a kind of appropriation of the territory.</p>
        <p>Lois Conner, a contemporary American photographer, has taken an almost opposite route in her photographs of China. She tries to approximate a Chinese mode of viewing by adopting a photographic format that relates to the experience of ancient scrolls. She uses a banquet camera -- an old-fashioned kind of panoramic camera with a 7-by-17-inch format -- because it comes closest to the elongated format she suspects originated in China. ''Lois Conner: Lotus,'' a show of her photographs at the Laurence Miller Gallery on 57th Street through Nov. 4, includes 26 images of lotuses and 20 of scenes in China, all in this narrow, gently meandering form with some pieced together till they are as a long as a journey or an epic tale.</p>
        <p>The 20 scenic photographs are from a new and handsomely printed book, ''The Photographs of Lois Conner: China'' (Callaway). It's reproduction quality is particularly important because Ms. Conner prints, beautifully, in platinum, which offers an exceptionally broad and graduated range of grays as well an extraordinary amount of detail, and she insists on showing her work without glass so that nothing impedes the perception of the medium's richness.</p>
        <p>The results are lovely and can be challenging, though some are just pretty pictures, and there may be a surfeit of lotuses in this show. Ms. Conner has an uncommon engagement with the uncommon landscape of China, and she has calmly and persistently watched it change during lengthy visits almost every year since 1984. While taking a course in Chinese painting, she was struck by paintings of karst formations near Guilin, pinnacles that improbably pop up out of the flat earth without warning to dance about the sky. Why, she thought, would anyone invent such a funny landscape?</p>
        <p>But, her instructor said, the invention was nature's own, truth once again proving stranger than fiction.  Ms. Conner won a Guggenheim fellowship in 1984 to photograph a landscape that she said looked like an electron photomicrograph of the human tongue.</p>
        <p>Today she says what she wants to do is to make a kind of believable fiction. China is a good place to start, and the elongated format is just right for the suggestion of something prodigious or storylike. A startling photograph in this show depicts an implausible rock formation where trees grow vigorously from sheer stone outcrops that time has carved into perfect points. China is so vast and nature so prolific there that several of these photographs look like dreams, if not like paintings.</p>
        <p>Sand dunes in the Gobi desert flow languidly like some viscous liquid that catches in its surface tension a thin, silvery veil of light and shade.  In one vertical photograph -- most are horizontals -- we look down on a small, hump-backed bridge, familiar from willow plates, and willow branches hang down from the top of the frame like repeated scratches of a pen. It turns out that this image was taken in a park in Beijing, a small fragment of old China in the midst of a highly developed area.</p>
        <p>That is the change that almost imperceptibly creeps into these pictures over the course of 15 years: China is urbanizing and booming, and Ms. Conner's unwieldy camera and tripod have been gradually moving into the cities. (She has frequently been stopped on suspicion of something or other but usually gains permission to photograph by asking how secretive the police think she can be with such a large apparatus. In fact, she says, she has had more trouble in America than in China.)</p>
        <p>Nature is not the only force capable of producing fantasyscapes. An exceptionally long, pieced image of Hong Kong, taken in 1994, cuts off the base and roofs of a rank of high-rise residences to produce a nearly endless, repetitive grid of windows, air conditioners and balconies, a diagram of a city scene of admirable rationality and apparent uninhabitability.</p>
        <p>Ms. Conner has followed the lotus, which in Chinese art symbolizes transient worldly glory and in Buddhism is emblematic of enlightenment and purity, from broad leaf and bloom to empty stalk and seed pod, then on to versions painted on doorways and worked into metal fences.  Dry, bent stems standing at odd angles in ponds can look like angular paintings by Cy Twombly or the handwriting of someone suffering from some strange linear psychosis.  When the light is right, it is nearly impossible to tell which lines are stems and which reflections, so the surface of the picture is scribbled over with little mathematical puzzles and irregular geometric forms.</p>
        <p>SHE started using a panoramic camera after seeing J. M. W. Turner's paintings, with their broad, encompassing vistas. She liked the camera's narrative capacity and potential for including a lot of people. (The banquet camera was devised to take portraits at banquets and was a godsend for photographers, who could take group pictures of 30 or 50 people and sell copies to each one.) Ms. Conner also thought the format showed more of the earth's curvature. She was wrong, of course, but correctness is seldom a matter of great importance in artistic calculations.</p>
        <p>Panoramas encompass not just additional space but additional time as well, which gives them another minor alliance to Chinese scrolls. A scroll is a journey through real time: one hand unrolls it as the reading or looking progresses, the other hand rolls up the part that has been perused. The event, story, imagery is only revealed in the process, as time elapses.</p>
        <p>The 7-by-17 format takes more time than the common photographic rectangle, and the long pieced-together pictures take a lot of time. It is difficult to see these all at once and very difficult to see their full length clearly unless you are at a distance; up close, your eyes must move across them. The visual field of view -- what the eyes see at any one time -- extends over roughly 170 to 200 degrees, but only about three degrees around the gaze point are at high resolution at any moment. Peripheral vision is blurred, though the mind corrects for that so that we're generally unaware of how little we're really seeing at the edges. If the image is long enough, we know our glance has to travel to take everything in.</p>
        <p>It must take sympathy, determination, zeal and an active spirit of inquiry to try to approach a foreign culture through its own mind's eye. Or maybe just hubris. Maybe it can't be done. Photographers can't win. If they see through the lens of their own culture, they're appropriating, imperialistically, whether as military or cultural colonizers. Today's self-consciously critical world, anxious about having remade life as a spectacle, may not allow photographers, or any kinds of observers -- or maybe anyone at all -- to believe in the possibility of a clean life. In the end everyone has dirty hands. Short of hubris, a really useful trait is obsession, which is probably helpful to photographers of any stripe.</p>
        <p>Ms. Conner is clearly determined.  She learned Chinese, not well, she claims, though she has taught a class at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. She zips around cities on a bike with 40-plus pounds of equipment tied on back with a bungee cord: ''When you see a Chinese with a chest of drawers and two children on a bike, pigs, whatever, you figure you can do it.'' With all her equipment, she always draws a crowd, which occasionally materializes out of thin air in the middle of a field.  That's fine with her. Convinced that photography is a kind of performance, she anticipates an audience and has on occasion turned around to photograph people more than willing to pose: the observer and the observed observing each other. She travels between regions by train, feeling, she says, as if she is in a map that is undulating. In the desert she goes by camel, another kind of undulation.</p>
        <p>She likes the big camera and tripod because ''there's something about being solid on the ground, feeling the landscape.'' Evidently the landscape is alive to her, and she communicates with it, an idea that sounds as if it might have been understood by ancient Chinese painters. There is the story of someone asking a noted artist what was behind the bush in a landscape he'd painted on a screen. The artist replied that he did not know but would go see. He walked into the screen, disappeared behind the bush, and was never seen again.</p>
        <p>In the West, we do not expect the artist to disappear into the work. If the landscape is alive, it will come to us, or at least we will dominate it; with one-point perspective, Renaissance artists put a single individual in control of the correct view. Nineteenth-century panoramas, painted or photographed, often covering 360 degrees, were large enough to increase the number of spectators while keeping them at the center of vision, as the camera itself was designed to do. The elongated photograph makes both the landscape and the viewer's dominance of it more extensive.</p>
        <p>Just a few steps down from the Laurence Miller Gallery, a store selling New York souvenirs displays panoramic, double-postcard-size views of the city on a sidewalk rack:  the metropolis as a potentially endless array of skyscrapers you can buy for a whole lot less than rent money and send home. You will be glad to know that the images are on recycled paper, thus saving the few trees left in the landscape for someone to photograph in the future.</p>
        <p>ART/ARCHITECTURE  Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  An article on Page 37 of Arts &amp; Leisure today about an exhibition of photographs of China misspells the photographer's surname in some copies. (The error also appears in some copies in a picture caption and a subheading on Page 37, in a caption with the continuation on Page 40 and in a front-page contents entry.) The photographer is Lois Conner, not Connor.</p>
