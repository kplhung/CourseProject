        <p>IN the final analysis, it came down to goose bumps.</p>

        <p>IN the final analysis, it came down to goose bumps.</p>
        <p>Angela Bassett had quickly recognized the role of Lena in ''Boesman and Lena,'' which opens on Friday, as one that doesn't come along often. The film is based on a 1969 work by the South African playwright Athol Fugard, who has called the character of middle-aged, mixed-race Lena ''the most challenging that I've put down on paper.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bassett had met the director John Berry and the producer Pierre Rissient one evening in early 1999, when the two men had flown in from Paris to Los Angeles to cast the film. She knew Berry by reputation: He had left Hollywood in the 1950's for France rather than testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee; he had directed not only film (''He Ran All the Way,''  ''Claudine'') but also theater, including a 1970 New York production of ''Boesman and Lena'' with Ruby Dee, James Earl Jones and Zakes Mokae. Yet a small, independent film is always a long shot.</p>
        <p>''There I was with two guys from France, sitting in a Thai restaurant in Los Angeles, and they're talking about making a movie in South Africa in a couple of months,'' she said, looking heavenward and throwing out her hands in a you-must-be-crazy gesture. ''When you're used to the way studios work, with all the men in suits and 10 years spent as if they're making another 'Platoon,' you have to say to yourself, 'How's this going to happen?' '' She was also newly married to the actor Courtney Vance (both are graduates of the Yale Drama School) and not sure she wanted to go to South Africa for a long stretch of time. ''It's not like going to Seattle for the weekend,'' she said. ''But Courtney said to me, 'Look, you're an Olympic swimmer; stop swimming in shallow waters.' ''</p>
        <p>At the time Ms. Bassett, who is now 42, was finishing up the 1999 film ''Music From the Heart,'' in which she played a New York City public school principal opposite Meryl Streep's eccentric music teacher. Her role is small, and she had considered turning it down, but she accepted it because it was an opportunity to work with Ms. Streep. So she told Ms. Streep about being asked to do ''Boesman and Lena.'' '' 'Oooh, I have goose bumps, Meryl said,' '' recalled Ms. Bassett over lunch recently in New York. ''We both started in theater, where it's all about the work, and you can get so wrapped up in the business of show business if you're doing films that you get away from your first love, the work. Goose bumps? I thought, that's a good thing. So it was really Meryl and her goose bumps that put me in Cape Town.''</p>
        <p>In ''Boesman and Lena,'' Danny Glover and Ms. Bassett play a couple whose relationship has been permeated by the harshness and cruelty of apartheid. As the film opens, a fire engulfs their shantytown; with belongings carried on his back and atop her head, the two set off by foot to mud flats outside Cape Town and begin to set up home for the night in a scrap-metal lean-to. Flashbacks show an attractive young couple with a home and a baby (who later died), their life holding out promise for the future. Much of what propels the narrative forward is Lena's attempts to sort through her life, to figure out how circumstances have led her to be living on mud flats with an abusive mate.</p>
        <p>''Playing Lena was like walking a tightrope,'' said Ms. Bassett. ''You're either really going to do it right, or you're going to fall on your behind and everybody's going to know it. I'd spent years of doing things I could do easily; all the work is important, but not all of it requires every cell of your being the way Lena did, the way Tina did.'' ''Tina'' is the rock star Tina Turner, who suffered years of abuse from her Svengalian husband Ike Turner. ''Tina was the most difficult role I've ever done physically, emotionally, spiritually,'' said Ms. Bassett, of her 1993 role opposite Laurence Fishburne in ''What's Love Got to Do With It'' ''It was 17 hours every day, either performing onstage in high heels or getting beaten up. Even when the camera wasn't on me, I gave it my all because I couldn't cheat Laurence.'' Both actors were nominated for Academy Awards.</p>
        <p>''As Tina, Angela was always in movement,'' Mr. Rissient said. ''That physicality drew us to her for Lena. You could feel the great intensity of her mind through those movements. You don't feel her acting. With 'Stella' '' -- in the movie ''How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' -- ''for instance, she was very good, very fluid, but it was a vehicle for her. It was Hollywood. It didn't have what she was showing in Tina.''</p>
        <p>Roles such as Lena and Tina are rare in Hollywood; more often than not, it's been ''swimming in shallow waters'' for Ms. Bassett. In films like ''How Stella Got Her Groove Back,''  ''Waiting to Exhale'' and ''Strange Days,'' she elevated the films with her performances. She has played real-life characters Betty Shabazz in Spike Lee's ''Malcolm X'' and Katherine Jackson in the 1992 miniseries ''The Jacksons: An American Dream,'' but even those did not offer her the range and depth of Tina or of roles she's played onstage.</p>
        <p>Shortly after graduating from Yale, Ms. Bassett was cast as ''every woman in the Bible: Mary, Eve, Noah's wife opposite five guys'' at the Hartford Stage Company. In New York City she played Antigone in a theater ''way over on 11th or 12th Avenue, where you still had to walk five blocks to the subway.'' Later she played the fevered convert Martha Pentecost on Broadway, in August Wilson's ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' the kind of role she loves, where ''you just tear up the scenery,'' she said with a growl. George Wolfe, producer of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, who directed Ms. Bassett in 1998 as Lady Macbeth, first saw her in ''Antigone.''  '' 'My God, who is that?' I thought,'' said Mr. Wolfe. ''You either have it or you don't, and she had it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bassett, who now is working on a film produced by Whoopi Goldberg set in the Louisiana bayou, grew up in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''Single-parent family, welfare, same song, second verse,'' she said, having said it enough and not wanting too much made of it. For Upward Bound, a program for disadvantaged students, she created a performance based on the poetry of Langston Hughes after listening to recordings of his work by Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis; the program also took her to Washington, where she saw James Earl Jones in ''Of Mice and Men'' onstage, which solidified her desire to act.</p>
        <p>Lloyd Richards, a former dean at Yale, recalls noting her ''strength, commitment and determination'' upon first meeting her. Of her role as Tina Turner, he said, ''She had found a home in that woman.''</p>
        <p>With Lena, she found another home. ''I've always been attracted to underdogs who triumph in the end with their spirit,'' Ms. Bassett said. ''It seems as if Lena's a lesser, weaker, disenfranchised human being. But there's still a song in her and a dance in her legs. She's able to find joy in the midst of all that suffering.'' Lena unnerves Boesman with her sexy and taunting spirit; she sings a little ditty and dances a jig; when they discover an ill man in the nearby bushes, she takes him in as if he were a long-lost child and warms to the respectful lilt with which he pronounces her name.</p>
        <p>''Beyond the scars, you see this pulsing heart in the urgency and strength Angela brought to Lena,'' said Danny Glover, who has starred in several Fugard plays onstage. ''The undercurrent of caring and shared memories she brought to the role humanized Boesman; it gave him another texture and allowed me to respond more fully to Lena.''</p>
        <p>BOTH Ms. Bassett and Mr. Glover found working with Berry, who died unexpectedly last December, just before editing was completed, a ''freeing experience.'' ''So many directors are telling you, 'Bring it down, pull it back, imagine the microphone is right here,' '' Ms. Bassett said, lowering her voice and touching her finger to her forehead. ''John was in his 80's, and we were working on rocky, sandy terrain. The camera would move and knock him over, but there he'd be, lying on the ground, calling out, 'Let's shoot from this angle.' ''</p>
        <p>She also found working in South Africa ''freeing physically.''</p>
        <p>''You can move, you can be big, you can be passionate,'' she said, the thoroughbred-horse-at-the-starting-gate part of her leaving behind the polite Southern girl. ''It's like the play 'Sarafina' '' -- the spirited antiapartheid musical. ''Within the first five minutes onstage bam! the actors are drenched. It's that passion that comes from oppression. It's fueled by who they are and where they are. It's in every fiber of their being.''</p>
        <p>Athol Fugard said, ''To make Lena work, you've got to dig in and realize that this is a human being who has arrived at the most profound existential crisis of her life. Who am I? Where am I? How did I get here? Lena's in total rebellion against the fact that her life is going to pass into oblivion. For Angela to get to those places is a big journey for an actor -- how any actor does that is mysterious. She has that winged imagination, which allows her to fly out of the limits of her own experience and settle into and live in another skin.''</p>
        <p>''Boesman and Lena'' was filmed during May and June of last year, and each day, as the actors and crew drove out to the set, they would pass women on the road carrying bundles of their belongings. ''I remember one woman just sitting along a dirt road, miles and miles from anywhere,'' said Ms. Bassett. ''She wasn't hitchhiking, she was just sitting. Who is she? I thought to myself.</p>
        <p>''She made me think of all the women like her, the people that folks can look past so easily, and I felt a burden for her as a human being. I kept her in my mind's eye as I played Lena. Who is she?''</p>
