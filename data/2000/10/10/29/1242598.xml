        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would like to raise a point of personal privilege. It concerns Christopher Hitchens's review of Anthony Summers's ''Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon'' (Oct. 8), in which Hitchens incorporates Summers's quotation from my memoir, ''Crazy Rhythm,'' to support Summers's and Hitchens's view of Nixon as singularly evil.</p>
        <p>The quoted passage concerns a trip I made, while in the Nixon White House, to Moscow. There, on instructions from Nixon himself, I portrayed him to Soviet officials as ''capable of acts of generosity and thoughtfulness but equally capable of barbaric cruelty to those who engage him in tests of strength,'' as ''more than a little paranoid because of years of bashing at the hands of political and media enemies,'' and as ''a man full of complex contradictions, a strategic visionary but, when necessary, a coldhearted butcher.'' In short, just what you would want the Soviets to think of an American president. And this internally contradictory picture ''turned out to be more or less true.''</p>
        <p>Now look at the way Summers elides the above passage, having me simply call Nixon ''more than a little paranoid . . . when necessary, a coldhearted butcher'' -- which, Summers has me reflecting ''ruefully'' in later years, ''turned out to be 'more or less true.' ''</p>
        <p>The misleading elision is no accident. Nixon, like virtually every important leader, was indeed contradictory. The Nixon hobbled by political scar tissue was no more ''the'' Nixon than was the Nixon whose thoughtful intelligence produced a wealth of serious policy making. Summers apparently cannot abide this irreducible complexity of politics. He assiduously elides the entire Nixon history, footnoting every report of wrongdoing or weirdness in a frenzy of pseudoscholarship while passing silently over any fact that does not fit.</p>
