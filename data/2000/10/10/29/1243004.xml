        <p>Beneath the silk head scarf, her eyes were filled with thought and prayer, grief and anger. Her voice was soft and urgent, as if spilling out the story of her husband might somehow bring him home.</p>
        <p>''He was just the imam in the mosque,'' Munira Nazarov said, patting the youngest of her six children, a boy of 7. ''He used to talk to people about studying the Koran and other good books. He didn't talk about politics.''</p>
        <p>Her husband, Obidhon Nazarov, the chief religious figure at one of Tashkent's largest mosques, went into hiding in March 1998 after being followed for days by the security police. Unable to find him, the authorities imprisoned his two brothers, a brother-in-law and an uncle. They detained his wife for 10 days, and men still pound on the door of his house with the butts of their Kalashnikov rifles in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>A largely unnoticed war is being waged in this Central Asian nation of 24 million. According to foreign and Uzbek human rights advocates and religious leaders, 4,000 to 5,000 Muslim men have been imprisoned in the last three years. There is evidence of systematic torture, from beatings to extracted toenails. Some prisoners have died.</p>
        <p>Religious leaders and human rights advocates say the only crime of the thousands detained is that they are pious Muslims. They contend that the government of President Islam Karimov, which has already banned opposition parties and silenced the independent press, is using a trumped-up threat of radical Islam to stamp out the last vestige of dissent.</p>
        <p>''The repression of religious people is worse than it ever was during the Soviet era,'' said Mikhail Ardzinov, chairman of a banned human rights group who was detained and beaten in 1999, when three members of his organization were imprisoned.</p>
        <p>Government officials deny using torture, but they justify other harsh steps by saying they are battling religious extremists determined to turn the country into a state like Iran or, worse, Afghanistan. President Karimov vowed in September to press the crackdown, telling state television, ''This plague and sickness are capable of infecting the minds of young people.''</p>
        <p>Since the Soviet Union collapsed, there has been a slow resurgence of Islam in traditionally Muslim Central Asia. The governments have tried to control its growth, sanctioning mosques and overseeing religious schools. But officials across the region, who tend to have an authoritarian bent, fear Islamic extremism, though the nature and seriousness of the threat are not always clear.</p>
        <p>Some dangers are concrete. Tajikistan fought a five-year civil war against Islamic insurgents that ended in 1997, leaving at least 50,000 dead. This summer, soldiers from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan battled 100 to 200 rebels from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. American officials say the group has ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan and to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier suspected of responsibility for terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>But in Tashkent, the targets of Mr. Karimov's campaign are members of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, or the Party of Liberation, which says it promotes Islam as a religious and a social force. Its leaders urge Muslims to pray five times a day and to study the Koran to prepare for a future Islamic government.</p>
        <p>The Hizb-ut-Tahrir criticizes the Uzbek government for corruption and repressing Muslims, but has not,  Western diplomats say, promoted violence.</p>
        <p>Chaasime Minovarov, deputy director of Uzbekistan's State Committee on Religious Affairs, which monitors religious groups, said thousands of men had been arrested for advocating replacing the current government with an Islamic state. He said that Hizb-ut-Tahrir has the same ideology as the gun-toting Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, but that the religious party may ultimately be more dangerous because its members appear nonviolent.</p>
        <p>''When the time comes, they will become warriors and they will start using weapons,'' Mr. Minovarov said. ''The government of Uzbekistan is trying its best to bring the influence of this group to zero.''</p>
        <p>The Uzbek crackdown began in 1992, after the start of the Tajikistan civil war. An Islamic-oriented political party and two human rights groups were outlawed, and the government tightened control over mosques. Imams were required to conclude their sermons by praising Mr. Karimov, the former Communist Party boss who has solidified his authority since he became the country's first elected president in 1991.</p>
        <p>Women wearing head scarves and men with beards, signs of Muslim piety, were banned from state universities in 1997. Mass roundups started the next year and increased after five car bombings in February 1999 killed 16 people. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan was blamed for the bombings, but any overtly observant Muslim was in danger of arrest.</p>
        <p>Some of the convictions of the thousands of detained people were based on anti-state activities like distributing religious material and proselytizing. Others were on narcotics offenses, which human rights advocates and family members denounced as spurious. In some instances, older men have been imprisoned in what Interior Minister Zokiron Almatov described as a policy of fathers paying for the sins of their sons.</p>
        <p>Often the suspects are tried in groups of 10 to 15, with guilty verdicts virtually certain. A Western diplomat who monitors the issue said he did not know of a single instance in which someone has been found innocent.</p>
        <p>Sentences have been harsh, sometimes including death.</p>
        <p>Azim Khodjaev, a father of two, died in prison last year. His body showed signs of severe torture, including extracted fingernails, said people who saw it. The family of Jurakhon Azimov said that half of his face was smashed and that his body was covered with bruises and razor-blade cuts. The official cause of death was heart failure.</p>
        <p>Furkhat Usamanov, 42, was convicted of possessing a Hizb-ut-Tahir pamphlet and died in prison. People who saw his body said he was bruised severely, but the authorities said he, too, died of heart failure.</p>
        <p>There are no reliable figures on how many prisoners have died in custody, or how many are held. Acacia Shields, the Tashkent representative of Human Rights Watch, which monitors abuses worldwide, estimated that at least 4,000 had been arrested; others put the figure at 5,000 or higher.</p>
        <p>Reviews of court cases and interviews with families of inmates produced evidence of torture, and Western diplomats have raised the issue with the Uzbek authorities. Still, it is difficult to know how widespread the torture may be or whether, as the families claim, drugs and other evidence are routinely planted by the police.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Nazarov came to an apartment near the center of Tashkent the other night, bringing her young son and another woman. Other groups trickled in as darkness fell and finally there were about 20 people.</p>
        <p>A dozen have husbands or sons in prison. Several knew one another from worshiping at Mr. Nazarov's mosque, and some were strangers.  The details of the arrests and torture were remarkably consistent.</p>
        <p>Mukhabat Deminova said her son, Bakhtiyor, 31, had been taken away with his friends, whom he had known since school days. ''They played football and went on picnics,'' she said. ''The police said they were planning a jihad, a holy war. They were in court Oct. 2, and all 10 showed bruises and broken bones and nails torn out.''</p>
        <p>Umida Azimova said her husband, Toyir Abdusamatov, had eluded the police for several months and gave himself up after being promised amnesty. Instead, he was convicted on anti-state charges and sentenced to 16 years, though he said in court that he was tortured into confessing.</p>
        <p>''He was taken to prison, and I will be able to see him only once a year for two hours,'' she said. ''So many people die in these prisons, and I am scared that he could be murdered.''</p>
        <p>The most notorious prison is in Zhaslyk in western Uzbekistan, a place where international monitors are forbidden. Prisoners have told their families that they are confined to their cells 23 hours a day and spend hours squatting, with their hands behind their heads. Whenever they move a limb, they are required to recite their thanks to President Karimov, their relatives say.</p>
        <p>Suraye Ergashev's husband, Tulkan, was an imam arrested after the February 1999 bombings and sentenced to six years for distributing religious tracts. His uncle was sentenced to eight years for the same crime.</p>
        <p>''After he was arrested, the militia didn't allow my children to go to school for a month, and they registered everyone who came to visit us,'' Mrs. Ergashev said. ''I have to take my four children and go to the police every 10 days now.''</p>
        <p>Few devout Muslim women in Uzbekistan work outside their homes. They said that they had little money and that the government refused to pay the assistance owed to their children. They are ostracized, and some have been forced to attend neighborhood rallies where they are denounced as traitors.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Karimov signed an amnesty for political prisoners, but it excluded people convicted of crimes against the state, which covers the religious inmates. Sultan Isokhodjaev went to the prosecutor who had convicted his son, Abdu Rashid, and pleaded for help.</p>
        <p>''He told me, 'If he killed somebody, maybe I could help, but not for this crime,' '' Mr. Isokhodjaev said.</p>
