        <p>This month American Heritage magazine features Tucson as its Great American Place for the year 2000.

But just as significant -- to visitors and residents -- is Tucson's attitude toward the pres ent, the way it lives every day con gusto.</p>
        <p>Tucson lies in the borderland, a region culturally distinct from the United States and Mexico. Its hypersaturated blend of Hispanic, Anglo and Indian influences is vividly apparent this time of year, when tiny handmade skeletons begin to appear everywhere. It is time for the Day  of the Dead, el Dia de los Muertos, celebrated Nov. 1. The little skeletons, called calacas, are jolly, workaday types -- bony musicians, merchants, brides and grooms. Symbolizing a joyful reunion with departed souls, they inhabit lavish shrines  on gravesites or in the home, along with candles and votive lights, marigolds, amulets, bright paper flowers and food. From Oct. 27 to Dec. 15,  the Arizona Historical Society will exhibit traditional shrines at 949 East Second Street. Call (520) 628-5774.</p>

        <p>This month American Heritage magazine features Tucson as its Great American Place for the year 2000. It's a tribute to the way the city uses aspects of its past to give visitors a ''historically significant travel experience.'' But just as significant -- to visitors and residents -- is Tucson's attitude toward the pres ent, the way it lives every day con gusto.</p>
        <p>Tucson lies in the borderland, a region culturally distinct from the United States and Mexico. Its hypersaturated blend of Hispanic, Anglo and Indian influences is vividly apparent this time of year, when tiny handmade skeletons begin to appear everywhere. It is time for the Day  of the Dead, el Dia de los Muertos, celebrated Nov. 1. The little skeletons, called calacas, are jolly, workaday types -- bony musicians, merchants, brides and grooms. Symbolizing a joyful reunion with departed souls, they inhabit lavish shrines  on gravesites or in the home, along with candles and votive lights, marigolds, amulets, bright paper flowers and food. From Oct. 27 to Dec. 15,  the Arizona Historical Society will exhibit traditional shrines at 949 East Second Street. Call (520) 628-5774.</p>
        <p>But long after the food and flowers are gone, the calacas keep turning up. Look for them in Christmas displays. True denizens of the borderland, they remind us that the future is uncertain and the fate of the soul is unknown. Here, life must be lived today, con gusto.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The annual All Souls Procession is organized by an informal collaboration of Tucson artists. Masks and puppets are thrust into the hands of spectators, who get drawn into the winding parade of floats, costumed musicians, dancers, clowns and puppeteers. Short stops allow for entertainment by performance groups. This year's procession, on Saturday, begins around 7 p.m. at the International Arts Center, 516 North Fifth Avenue. For information, call Tucson Puppet Works, 111 East Congress Street; (520) 770-1533.</p>
        <p>The Academy of Ancient Music, a British ensemble, plays Baroque and early classical music as it sounded at the time it was written. Works by Bach, Handel and Vivaldi will be performed at Centennial Hall, 1020 East University Boulevard, (520) 621-3341, on Nov. 9, at 7:30 p.m. Tickets $36 to $48.</p>
        <p>Also at Centennial Hall, the Bale Folclorico da Bahia, part of the  Arte Latino Americano series, will present its mix of Latin melody and propulsive Afro-Brazilian rhythms  on Nov. 16 at 7:30 p.m. Costumes for the 32-member troupe are equally compelling. Tickets $22 to $34.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 18, Greg LeMond, three-time winner of the Tour de France, will join nearly 5,000 cyclists in the Touchstone Energy Tour de Tucson, which is dedicated to him this year. Riders will compete over circuits of 111, 75, 50, and 31 miles around Tucson, crossing mountains and dry riverbeds. They start at 7 a.m. at the Tucson Convention Center, 260 South Church Avenue. The winner should cross the finish line back at the center a little over four hours later. A carnival atmosphere surrounds the free event; (520) 745-2033.</p>
        <p>This year's version of El Nacimiento will be unveiled on Nov. 18 at Casa Cordova, on the property of the Tucson Museum of Art, 140 North Main Avenue; (520) 624-2333; www .tucsonarts.com. Since 1975, Maria Luisa Tena has arranged the elaborate room-size Nativity, using more than 400 hand-painted miniatures in an exuberant mix of herald angels and Day of the Dead skeletons. El Nacimiento will be open daily; no admission fee.</p>
        <p>At St. Augustine's Cathedral, 192 South Stone Avenue, (520) 623-6351, the 8 a.m. service every Sunday is a mariachi Mass sung in Spanish. The  service is easy to follow, the ensemble performs with brio, and visitors are always welcome.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Current attractions at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, 2021 North Kinney Road, (520) 883-2702, www. desertmuseum.org, include brother-and-sister mountain lions that are almost 3 years old, the remains of a Sonorasaurus, a 100-million-year-old brachiosaur that may hold the key to evolutionary sequences, and a recently renovated javelina habitat. These boarlike creatures snack on cactus or sharpen their tusks in the shade of four stone bridges, contained in their habitat by nearly invisible fencing. Open daily; general admission: $8.95; ages 6 to 12 $1.75; children under 6 free.</p>
        <p>Just five peaceful acres in the heart of the city, the Tucson Botanical Gardens, 2150 North Alvernon Way, (520) 326-9686, on the Web at www.tucsonbotanical.org, comprise more than a dozen separate horticultural areas, including gardens to attract birds and butterflies; gardens for herbs, irises and wildflowers; a sensory garden; a path lined with plants of the Tohono O'odham tribe; and a long allee of prickly pears. Open daily. General admission: $4. During Luminaria Nights, Dec. 1  to 3, 2,000 flickering candles will  provide illumination for Christmas shopping with music and hot cider. The $5 admission fee benefits the gardens.</p>
        <p>Mission San Xavier del Bac, the 200-year-old ''white dove of the desert,'' is a shimmering arrangement of domes, towers and arches rising out of the Tohono O'odham reservation 12 miles south of Tucson, at Interstate 19 Exit 92. The subtle amalgam of Moorish, Byzantine and late Mexican Renaissance influences has made it one of the finest examples of Spanish mission architecture in the United States. The extravagantly ornamented interior has recently been recently restored by some of the experts who worked on the Sistine Chapel. Open daily; call (520) 294-2624 for a schedule of daily Masses.</p>
        <p>The new Tucson Visitor Center in the shady central courtyard of La Placita Village, 110 South Church Avenue, Suite 7199, (520) 629-4492, www.visittucson.org, is open daily. La Placita Village, a complex of restaurants, businesses and, eventually, shops painted in brilliant Mexican colors, is part of the downtown revival in Tucson. At 7 p.m. Thursday the plaza in front of the visitor center becomes Cinema La Placita, offering free classic films under the stars.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Peak rates begin early in December.</p>
        <p>Though it's part of a national chain, the Embassy Suites at 5335 East Broadway, (520) 745-2700, fax (520) 790-9232, www.embassysuites .com, doesn't have a generic air. Behind the terra cotta facade with its soaring bell tower, 142 suites are stacked around a glimmering outdoor pool. Each has a bedroom, a galley kitchen, and a living room with sleep sofa, dining table and desk with data port. A one-bedroom suite with two double beds is about $119 (the chain offers various discounts).</p>
        <p>Set on 34 acres with mountain views all around, Hacienda del Sol Guest Ranch Resort, 5601 North Hacienda del Sol Road, (800) 728-6514, fax (520) 299-5554, on the Web  at www.haciendadelsol.com, was a girls' school before it became a popular escape for Hollywood stars of the 1940's. All 30 rooms have recently been redecorated, but they retain their Spanish colonial charm. Amenities include tennis, pool, stables, and the Grill, a nationally recognized restaurant. Doubles range from $115 to $140, casitas from $250 to $315.</p>
        <p>Hotel Congress, 311 East Congress Street, (800) 722-8848, fax (520) 792-6366, www.hotcong.com. was built in 1919 for passengers debarking at the Southern Pacific Railroad station across the street. Its Art Deco charm has been painstakingly maintained. Downstairs, at Club Congress, there's loud music every night until 1 a.m. The quietest rooms are 216, 217 and 218. Rates range from $48 to $75. Artists, students, and anyone over 60 gets a 10 percent discount.</p>
        <p>Budget: The Frontier Motel, 227 West Drachman Street, (520) 798-3005, fax (520) 798-3616, is one of a cluster of old-fashioned motor courts near downtown that have been reclaimed by an extended family of East Indian entrepreneurs. A small pool and fragrant orange trees occupy the grassy central courtyard. Surrounding it, 20 tidy little brick cabins with Mexican tile roofs are simple but comfortable, with phone and cable TV. Doubles run $35.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The elegant Arizona Inn, 2200 East Elm Street, (800) 933-1093, fax (520) 881-5830, www.arizonainn .com, has been undergoing subtle refurbishments recently, toning up already gracious rooms and enhancing its international reputation for privacy, comfort and impeccable service. The family-owned inn, built in 1930, occupies 14 serene acres. Within its coral-pink walls, surrounded by velvety lawns and gardens, 86 rooms and suites occupy adobe-style casitas, many with patios and fireplaces. Doubles start at $140.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>At Cafe Terra Cotta, 4310 North Campbell Avenue, (520) 577-8100, fax (520) 577-0615, ''contemporary Southwestern'' describes the food and the ambience. (The restaurant is moving Jan. 1 to 3500 Sunrise Drive.) The menu extends from simple Oa xacan grilled-beef skewers on Southwestern tabbouleh ($6.95) to signature plates such as duck two ways: a grilled breast of duck and a duck carnitas spring roll served with a sweet ancho-ginger sauce ($18.25). Dinner for two, with appetizers, wine and chocolate desserts that stun the senses, costs about $100 with tip.</p>
        <p>In the foothills of the Catalina Mountains, Soleil, 3001 East Skyline Drive, (520) 299-3345, fax (520) 232-0815, is part of a stylish new complex of galleries called El Cortijo (The Grange). The cluster of low, white buildings was designed to evoke an old Spanish farmhouse, and the restaurant specializes in Mediterranean cuisine. A three-course dinner for two, built around bouillabaisse, perhaps, or lavender honey duck with a spinach souffle, can cost $150 with a modest bottle of wine (there are more than 100 varieties by the glass). It commands a stupendous, panoramic view of mountains and city lights.</p>
        <p>At Li'l Abner's Steak House, 8500 North Silverbell Road, (520) 744-2800, you eat at one of 30 outdoor picnic tables under the mesquite trees, or inside in one of five rooms, three with with big stone fireplaces, all with red-checked tablecloths. There's no menu; the waitress rattles off your options, all of which are grilled, meat or chicken. The half-dozen entrees range from a half-order of ribs ($10.95) to a 32-ounce porterhouse ($24.95). Everything comes with salad and all the succulent pinto beans, Texas toast and salsa you can eat. Dinner for two, with a couple of Fat Tire pale ales on tap, about $50.</p>
        <p>Tooley's Cafe, home of the turkey taco, is attached to La Bodega, a marketplace for garden art, Oriental rugs and Mexican furniture, at 299 South Park Avenue, (520) 670-1190, across from a row of colorful import houses in the Lost Barrio warehouse district. A dozen bright tables are scattered inside and out on the patio. Lunch entrees, around $4.50, include a crisp, fresh turkey taco salad served on a soft grilled flour tortilla bigger than the plate, and six different fat burritos, many smothered in piquant chili rojo. With soda, iced tea or limeade, lunch for two rarely tops $12.</p>
        <p>Few places in Tucson offer meals late at night, but the clubby little  Cup Cafe in Hotel Congress, 306  East Congress Street, (520) 798-1618, serves until 1 a.m. Thursday to Saturday, till 11 p.m. the rest of the week. The menu is eclectic, featuring goat cheese and artichoke crostini ($7.95), Thai chicken satay with peanut sauce, cucumber salad and rice ($9.95), and a Gila monster sandwich of Southwestern meatloaf and jack cheese ($5.95).</p>
