        <p>IN this unwavering New York story, this  interborough spectacle that America treated like a television show about nothing, all that was missing was for George  Costanza's father to interrupt the World  Series trophy presentation and scream to his son's fictional Boss, ''How could you trade Al Leiter for Jesse Barfield?''</p>
        <p>Forget the laugh track, George Steinbrenner got weepy again on national television, an annual occurrence now, even if the audience is shrinking, trophy by trophy. Steinbrenner has owned the Yankees for 28 seasons, a reign that is longer than any other in the history of the franchise. He is the toast of the town, a sports empire builder who, like the city itself, has flourished spectacularly in the 90's, or since he was suspended from baseball by the then-Commissioner Fay Vincent and the majority of Yankee fans wished he wouldn't come back.</p>
        <p>Less than a decade ago, Steinbrenner's Yankees were a transit nightmare, when the owner had the capacity, among other dastardly qualities, to fire his pitching coach and overhaul his entire staff between 161st Street and 125th. ''I just won you the pennant,'' he crowed to his manager, Lou Piniella, one summer day in 1987, when he landed the wild and washed-up left-hander by the name of Steve Trout.</p>
        <p>This also happened to be the year that Leiter, out of Toms River, N.J., made his first appearance in the Bronx, at 21, with all of 23 1/3 Class AAA innings under his belt, a classic case of dumb Yankee doodling. Under such unrealistic expectations and conditions did the hard-throwing Leiter struggle with control, with blisters on his pitching hand and other assorted handicaps of youth. By 1989, deemed a Yankee failure at the age of 23, he was on his way to Toronto for Barfield, a slugging gentleman who had a hole in his swing the size of the one in the ozone.</p>
        <p>''I was upset,'' Leiter said before the Subway Series, before he would pitch two brilliant ballgames and win neither, as the Yankees continued their dominance of the sport in five fierce games. ''I grew up in the area, and here I was a teammate of Winfield, Guidry and Mattingly.''</p>
        <p>Watching Leiter, the classic late-blooming lefty, twice battle Andy Pettitte in the Series was like being witness to a wrestling match between the sagely constructed Yankees of the mid to late 1990's and a determined ghost of Steinbrenner's more impatient past. More than any Met, Leiter, given the turn of a few fateful plays in Games 1 and 5, might have been responsible for making Steinbrenner more miserable than ever.</p>
        <p>The owner is still, by many accounts, a champion second-guesser, but then, Pettitte is also the indisputable proof of how he has developed the knack for making use of his ears, of listening to people who know more.</p>
        <p>''I'm almost positive that Mr. Steinbrenner was ready to get rid of me last year,'' Pettitte said after his seven-inning, no-earned-run performance Thursday night set up the Mets for the ninth-inning kill. ''People in the organization stood by me, and I'm still here, and for that, I'm grateful.''</p>
        <p>Last season Joe Torre stood by Pettitte -- the early bloomer with 55 victories between 1996 and 1998 -- when he couldn't get anyone out and was on the verge of being shipped to Philadelphia. And for that, Steinbrenner should be lighting Torre's cigars, massaging his feet. Of course, Torre was also said to be in favor of jettisoning Bernie Williams the previous year for Albert Belle, until sanity prevailed with Steinbrenner's baseball people, the group General Manager Brian Cashman likes to call the ''Knights of the Round Table.''</p>
        <p>Only when the Boss was punished for his sleazy involvement in a scheme to discredit Dave Winfield, his own player, did the Yankees configure a table where the only relevant opinion wasn't at the head. Those homegrown Yankees who still form their indispensable nucleus -- Williams, Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera -- would not necessarily be here without Gene Michael and Buck Showalter, and on to Bob Watson, Cashman and Torre.</p>
        <p>In this era of runaway big-market payrolls, baseball had better do something, or those Series ratings are going to keep sliding, into single digits. Lack of interest was less a repudiation of New York, New York than it was a case of too many markets whose teams are no more than schedule-filler by May and who don't care by October.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are no worse than the free spenders in Baltimore and Los Angeles, and at least they know what they're doing. Ten years ago, Steinbrenner would have surrendered his farm system for a Sammy Sosa, ignoring all subtlety, the beauty of a sport whose championships can be determined by the likes of Jose Vizcaino (Game 1) and Luis Sojo (Game 5).</p>
        <p>Though he got the victory in neither game, Andy Pettitte was at least here to pitch masterfully against the equally superb Leiter. Bravo to both. Steve Trout they weren't.</p>
