        <p>IN the movie ''Dancer in the Dark,'' the factory worker played by Bjork daydreams her black-and-white life into a Technicolor musical, where, to the music of machinery, her co-workers become so many Fred and Gingers.</p>
        <p>I can identify. I, too, have nurtured a fantasy world where choreography is king. In mine, I'm a Lois Lane, interviewing Yankee fans at a sports bar after a game. The men are wearing fedoras; they gradually begin to thump the bar in unison. I put out a pink gloved hand and am whirled down the line. A major production number ensues, culminating in my tap solo, at the end of which I thrust a sheaf of paper into the air and yell, ''Copy!''</p>
        <p>But in my dream world, the soft-shoe is not as important as the intricate dance of manners: the balletic sweep of a door opening, the wordless cue of a chair nudging the back of your knees. It is a world in which etiquette is the architecture and small courtesies are the ornaments, and I am partial to one courtesy in particular. I like to be called Miss Dewan.</p>
        <p>Not, of course, by my friends. And I have despaired of resurrecting the use of courtesy titles at the office. But in introductions and elevators, at least, let me be Miss.</p>
        <p>My affection for this affectation comes from etiquette envy. My life span is congruent with that of Ms. magazine. Born in 1971, the year the magazine was announced, I am a product of its Stories for Free Children: independent, bossy, a breadwinner. It never would have occurred to my mother, Gaynelle, to be known as an appendage to my father, and if I had seen an envelope addressed to Mrs. Prem Dewan, I would have thought it was a typo.</p>
        <p>But in more proper households, whose lawns seemed, to me, greener, Ms. was nothing more than an arriviste with an agenda. In 1975, an edition of Emily Post advised that Ms. could be used for an unmarried woman who had a child. By 1978, Letitia Baldrige lectured that ''no one has the right to criticize a woman's desire to use her own name as part of her own identity.'' But her Ms. was to be used at the office, or by divorced women.</p>
        <p>Although one survey found that by the early 1980's a third of American women supported the use of Ms., there was still substantial resistance. The New York Times waited until 1986 to decide that Ms. had ''become part of the language,'' as it said in an editors' note, and would thenceforth appear in its news columns. That was four years after Ms. Pacman.</p>
        <p>In one sense, The Times was right in waiting and thinking that Ms. was merely a fad. It certainly was in high society. Ten years ago, young women would call the International Debutante Ball and request that their pink invitations bear the title Ms., the ball's general chairwoman, Margaret Hedburg, recalled. But nowadays, they almost never object to being identified as Miss. At Dempsey &amp; Carroll, the stationers, Ms. is frowned upon and rarely requested. Married women are known by their husbands' names, first and last. Shocking as it seems, the Mrs. Edward Cramers are back in force. If, in fact, they ever left.</p>
        <p>For the rest of us, however, Ms. is the default title. Men, in particular, are flabbergasted when they learn that I find Miss more fetching. Bless your well-trained hearts, fellows. But Miss is my preference, and for the age-old reason: it is far more discreet than dropping a handkerchief. It lets people know you are eligible, but stops short of suggesting that you're available.</p>
        <p>Besides, must the English language be pruned of every out-of-favor bud? I grant that there may be some unsavory connotations -- we must contend with Miss Lonelyhearts -- but let us not forget Miss Moneypenny and the lavender-clad Miss Piggy. And remember, connotations evolve. A Miss was once a concubine or a common prostitute. If she is now taken to be merely a Mrs.-in-waiting, well, it's only a matter of time, I contend, before she is remade as a self-sufficient gal frantically occupied with being fabulous and single. I wear the title Miss just as I used to wear a sun dress with my combat boots.</p>
        <p>Of course, I cannot rehabilitate Miss all by myself. Looking for moral support, I called Jennifer Salomon, a friend, who first opened my eyes to the idea that the ironclad logic of etiquette, properly followed, is the opposite of snobbery. A master of minutiae, she is the sort who will point out that one must not congratulate a bride, thereby implying that a husband is some sort of prize. I felt reasonably certain she would back me up. But she did not. ''Miss implies to me that I am not competent, not confident, not fully capable of doing my own thing,'' she said. ''The word 'Ms.' sounds more complete.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Salomon, now in law school in Austin, Tex., is 25. Chelsea Clinton, 20, likes Ms., according to her mother's campaign spokesman. On a hunch, I called Ms. Salomon's oldest sister, Jill, a wine marketer who is 29 and lives in Manhattan. She wanted Miss. So did my friend Lalena Fisher, 31. ''I would have chosen Ms. before, but now that I'm in a rock band, Miss is better because it seems youthful,'' she said. Hmmm. Could it be an age thing? Is Ms. a grown-up outfit for the younger set, and Miss a corsage to be pinned on the slightly more seasoned professional?</p>
        <p>Monica Lewinsky, 27, was called ''that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' by the president, and ''Ms.'' by Kenneth Starr. But she told me she didn't have a preference. ''I'm kind of looking forward to being called Mrs.,'' she said, frank as ever. (For the record: when pressed, she chose Miss. Yes!)</p>
        <p>Susan Choi, 31, a novelist who lives in Brooklyn, prefers Miss. ''There is something about Ms. that seems very defensive,'' Miss Choi said. ''It reminds me of a period in which women in the workplace had to be on the defensive. It seems to have a negative connotation, not about the woman but about her situation.''</p>
        <p>When she worked as a fact checker at The New Yorker, she said, she was called Frau Choi, either because of her exactitude or just for the perversity of all those vowels. ''I kind of like Miss Choi, though,'' she said. ''It connotes the 20's and you have, like, a pencil stuck in your bun. It's because we have the luxury of harking back to that stuff.''</p>
        <p>Ah, yes, the luxury. And the guilt. Women once picketed The Times, after all, in the 1970's, over the issue of being forced to reveal their marital status in print. Are we so ungrateful as to disown progress?</p>
        <p>My next call only deepened my doubts. ''I flinch when I hear Ms,'' said Kristina Stewart, 33, the society editor of Vanity Fair. ''Ms. is just totally outdated.''</p>
        <p>But when it came to Miss, she could not be enthusiastic enough. ''Miss is a neoconservative response to the rebellious, fringe behavior of the 70's,'' she said. ''Our generation is saying, 'The system's not all that horrible.' ''</p>
        <p>Uh-oh.</p>
        <p>Neoconservative? I was thinking more Audrey Hepburn.</p>
        <p>Before I went a step further in my crusade, I had to get clearance. I called Gloria Steinem. ''Ms. Steinem,'' I asked, taking a cowardly tack, ''what would you say if I told you I was 29, and I thought the word 'Ms.' had all this feminist baggage I didn't identify with, and I wanted to go back to using Miss?''</p>
        <p>She paused, but not for very long. ''I would say it's all about the power to make a choice,'' she said. Whew!</p>
        <p>''Doing away with all titles would be my preference,'' said the woman who named a magazine after one.</p>
        <p>At that, everyone in fantasyland froze, mid-pirouette. No titles? No distinction between the sexes at all? Next thing you know, she'll be telling us not to curtsy.</p>
        <p>It was time to call the Boss. Maybe she would let me visit and sit at her feet. But no, Miss Manners, a k a Judith Martin, the etiquette columnist, conveyed her wishes by phone. ''One of these days I'm just going to standardize everything,'' she declared from Etiquette Central, where the use of titles is strongly encouraged. ''When the system is not standardized, you can annoy people just by greeting them.''</p>
        <p>I nodded. As with poor Bjork, my attempts to weave fantasy into reality often end in disaster. A hopeful ''Good afternoon, Mr. So-and-So'' is met not with a gracefully symmetrical reply but with suspicion (am I currying favor?), hurtfulness (am I implying that Mr. So-and-So is getting on in years?) or worse, a well-meaning request to ''Please, call me Al.'' Sigh.</p>
        <p>Yet, Miss Manners refused to endorse my crusade. Ms., she pointed out, is more practical, and besides, it first appeared on a Plymouth, Mass., tombstone in 1767. As William Safire has suggested, that may have been the work of an absent-minded chiseler. Still, Ms. was not invented by feminists: the Oxford English Dictionary finds its first printed occurrence in a 1952 letter-writing handbook. Ms.'s pedigree is good enough for Mrs. Martin.</p>
        <p>She would not even permit me to tell people I preferred Miss, unless I promised to be good-natured. ''Not if you're going to give a lecture, not if you're going to reprimand people and not if you're going to insist upon using your choice for people who prefer something else,'' she lectured.</p>
        <p>Yet, her position, I couldn't help notice, enabled her to guard both her franchises: the title Miss (which in her case comes from an old rule recited to children at the dinner table: ''Leave some for Miss Manners'') and the prerogative of ordering people around.</p>
        <p>Oh, Miss Manners, I love it when you scold.</p>
