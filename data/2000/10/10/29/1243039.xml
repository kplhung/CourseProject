        <p>Byron Scott calls his shot, his eyes dancing and his mouth forming an ''I got you now'' grin.</p>
        <p>A little postpractice competition in the Nets' gym transforms Scott, a 39-year-old father of three, from the rookie coach of the Nets into a trash-talking kid.</p>
        <p>The former sure-shooter for the ''Showtime'' Los Angeles Lakers shouts playfully to Stephon Marbury and buries, with aplomb, the 3-pointer in Marbury's face. When Marbury, Scott's franchise point guard, launches a baseline air ball, the coach howls in delight. Scott makes his final shot. Game over.</p>
        <p>Neither accepts losing. But in this particular game, Marbury loves it as much as he hates it, considering his competition.</p>
        <p>''He's a born champion,'' Marbury says later, when Scott is out of range. ''The guy has three championship rings. He has what everybody in this world plays for.''</p>
        <p>Scott has what the Nets have been desperately seeking throughout their potholed history of missteps. And it is not just the jewelry from three National Basketball Association titles he won with the Lakers, heirlooms that Scott never wears.</p>
        <p>He has the attitude. The Nets chose Scott, with only two years' experience as an assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings, because he is an unequivocal winner, an upright man rooted to the simple principle: ''Do it right, or don't do it at all.''</p>
        <p>The Nets were 31-51 last season, and players complained about a lack of direction under Coach Don Casey. In the first week of Scott's boot camp, the players did not complain while trudging off the court.</p>
        <p>''This is what we need,'' said the veteran Kendall Gill, the team's most fit player, who was exhausted after practice.</p>
        <p>Scott, his hands on his hips, polo shirt buttoned to the top button and blue cards detailing drills sticking out of his shorts, ran a firm but fair training camp. He established his tone without screaming, letting his assistants become hoarse as he watched, his jaw locked in fierce concentration, the same focus he exhibited as a player.</p>
        <p>A man who starred on the Lakers but was never voted an All-Star, Scott exudes confidence, but not ego. He is just three years removed from his playing career, and like the players on game days, he comes to the arena wearing sweats, changing into a sport coat and pants, after arriving with his wife and teenage daughter.</p>
        <p>He is never too serious to joke around, though, earning him the highest validation from his star point guard. ''He's cool,'' Marbury said. ''He looks like he could still play.''</p>
        <p>But Scott is conscious of the line between players and coach. In the third week of preseason, after the Nets had dropped three consecutive exhibition games, Scott reverted to two-a-day practices and relentless rounds of sprints.</p>
        <p>''No more losing!'' Scott urged in the huddle. ''We have to change our mentality every day.''</p>
        <p>Magic Johnson, Scott's best friend from the Lakers, stopped by practice on the first night of camp and said, ''It's changing already.'' Then Johnson laughed, struck by the resemblance: ''He's like Junior Riley out there.''</p>
        <p>Scott used to do dead-on impressions of Lakers Coach Pat Riley for his teammates, never thinking the imitation would become serious. Johnson knew.</p>
        <p>''Before games, Byron used to call me and Michael Cooper together for film sessions to watch the guards at 8:30 in the morning,'' Johnson said. ''I'd tell him, 'B' are you crazy?' ''</p>
        <p>Just driven. Today, Scott reflects Riley's discipline, conditioning drills and commitment to defense. Riley's playbook was Melvillean at 270 pages; Scott's is nearly that big, two encyclopedia-like reference works for offense and defense.</p>
        <p>Though he keeps his 6-foot-4-inch body meticulously trim and still can shoot well enough to match his 48.2 percent career average, Scott knows he cannot play a full-court game anymore. He has transferred his work ethic to the sideline, carrying the same mentality he had under Riley, but one he learned 14 blocks away from the Forum.</p>
        <p>Growing up in Inglewood, Calif., amid gangs and drugs, Scott often made choices at the sound of a gun and determinedly lived the lessons of his parents. ''My father worked in a furniture store, on the docks, all these odd jobs just to keep us above water,'' said Scott, the oldest of four children. ''His will rubbed off on me that I could be the best I could be in whatever I chose, and when I moved on to something else that I had the same work ethic, the same desire to be the best at that also.''</p>
        <p>His mother instilled a righteous will that has become Scott's trademark. ''My mom was the toughest 5-foot-5 lady you've ever seen,'' Scott said. ''She had a real soft voice, but she had a real anger about herself when you did her wrong; she was like a pit bull.''</p>
        <p>Same as Scott. He used to fight with his brother Jeff, trying to persuade him to live a life free of drugs. Seven years ago, Scott gave Jeff a job at the basketball camp that Scott has run since 1985 in Orange County and loaned him his car.</p>
        <p>''He took my Blazer and drove to Utah, and robbed a jewelry store,'' Scott said. ''He almost got me in trouble, and that was my last straw. I don't forgive very easily.'' They have not spoken in four years.</p>
        <p>Scott left Inglewood for Arizona State, and after becoming the school's career-leading scorer, he was drafted as the fourth overall pick in 1983 by the San Diego Clippers. But the day before the preseason, the Clippers traded him to the Lakers, his childhood team, for guards Norm Nixon and Eddie Jordan, who is Scott's top assistant with the Nets.</p>
        <p>Johnson and Cooper missed the popular Nixon and at first threw elbows and words at Scott, then ignored him off the court. ''Just to test him,'' Johnson said. ''We did everything together after that. We used to call each other the Three Amigos.''</p>
        <p>On a team with brilliant personalities, Scott was loud only on the perimeter. He went to the N.B.A. Finals six times with the Lakers, and had his career year in 1987-88, leading the team in scoring with 21.7 points, shooting 52.3 percent.</p>
        <p>His run with the Lakers ended in 1993, when he signed as a free agent with the Indiana Pacers, the team that delivered him to coaching. During training camp, the Pacers coach, Larry Brown, asked Scott a simple question that changed his life: ''How did you guys do this with the Lakers?''</p>
        <p>Scott described some of Riley's plays and strategies, but then, feverish with inspiration, he rummaged through the garage for home movies from his Laker days and began drawing diagrams in a spiral notebook with an orange, basketball-like cover.</p>
        <p>''I started looking at the game a bit differently,'' he said. ''I didn't play at that time any more like a player, I started thinking about it as a coach.''</p>
        <p>Scott tutored shooting guard Reggie Miller and in Scott's two seasons with the Pacers, they made the Eastern Conference finals. Having made the playoffs every season, Scott learned a cruel, but crucial lesson the following year, when the Vancouver Grizzlies took him in the 1995 expansion draft.</p>
        <p>''You want to be a coach,'' Anita Scott told her husband, ''then you need to experience losing.''</p>
        <p>His team lost 67 games that season. Scott found it frustrating at first, throwing rocks and already broken golf clubs in the woods behind his house. But eventually he became resigned. ''I said, 'We just don't have the talent, so I can accept to a certain extent the losses we had,''' Scott recalled.</p>
        <p>It is a perspective he might need to reclaim, considering the injuries that have ravaged the Nets, including Keith Van Horn's broken leg that will keep him out the first month of the season, which the Nets open at home Tuesday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
        <p>Scott made a prediction in the spiral notebook in June and holds to it. ''I just wrote we'll have a successful season,'' Scott said. ''If this team continues to progress, I think we have a realistic shot of making the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Scott is in New Jersey because the Nets' new president, Rod Thorn, rushed to hire him last June, after the Pacers could not give Scott a quick decision on their coaching vacancy. Thorn was impressed then, and now, with Scott's preparation.</p>
        <p>''He was a savvy player who studied the game under some great coaches,'' Thorn said. ''His training camp has been great. I think that he's got a way about him that demands respect. He's doing all the right things to turn the attitude around here.''</p>
        <p>Jordan understands why. ''The players respect him, because they know he doesn't have a huge ego,'' he said. ''He's soft-spoken, but when he talks about his experiences, especially his family, there is a real strong-willed side to him. There is a non-negotiable part to him.''</p>
        <p>At Sacramento, Scott's firm but open manner helped him form an easy bond with the players, one he developed almost instantly in New Jersey, especially with Marbury. Anita Scott is not surprised, given his gift for teaching and patience off the court. ''I'm amazed that he will sit with our kids for three hours helping them with their homework,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Scott has always taken his children to school and used to take his oldest son, Thomas, on trips with the Pacers. Thomas, 17, is still in Sacramento for his senior year in high school, hoping to earn a college basketball scholarship. The Scotts' daughter, LonDen, 13, and youngest son, DaRon, 9, have settled into the family's new house in Livingston, N.J., where their father refuses to build a trophy room.</p>
        <p>He displays his success in his own quiet way, and now, he hopes, in a new role. ''I've been through everything you can on the basketball court,'' Scott said. ''I've witnessed what winning does to players and what losing does to players. The winning, I'm not going to say makes me an expert, but experienced. I think that's what makes me ready, because I know what it takes.''</p>
