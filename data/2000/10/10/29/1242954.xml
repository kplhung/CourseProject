        <p>I'm getting excited just thinking about it. I'm dreaming of that moment when the thrill returns.</p>
        <p>All those Texas fat cats landing at Reagan airport, wing to jowl, in their Lear jets. All those monogrammed snakeskin cowboy boots and Neiman Marcus fur coats. All those familiar Establishment suits lumbering in to claim their rightful places at the Cabinet table. Dick Cheney -- the Britney Spears for middle-aged white men -- back in the West Wing saddle. Lee Greenwood back at the inaugural. Aerobic golf at Kennebunkport. The horseshoe pit restored outside the Oval. The English language once more under siege by an American president.</p>

        <p>I'm getting excited just thinking about it. I'm dreaming of that moment when the thrill returns.</p>
        <p>All those Texas fat cats landing at Reagan airport, wing to jowl, in their Lear jets. All those monogrammed snakeskin cowboy boots and Neiman Marcus fur coats. All those familiar Establishment suits lumbering in to claim their rightful places at the Cabinet table. Dick Cheney -- the Britney Spears for middle-aged white men -- back in the West Wing saddle. Lee Greenwood back at the inaugural. Aerobic golf at Kennebunkport. The horseshoe pit restored outside the Oval. The English language once more under siege by an American president.</p>
        <p>Happy Halloween! We could be fixin' for the big Washington premiere of ''Book of Shadows: Bush 2.''</p>
        <p>Last week I watched Al Gore growling and fending off Bill Clinton and still struggling to lay claim to his own administration's tumescent economy. And I watched W. bristling with confidence, giving a good speech in Pittsburgh and cozying up to John McCain and Colin Powell.</p>
        <p>I had to sit very quietly and absorb the fact that I might be on my way back to the future. Were we on the eve of restoration?</p>
        <p>Given that Bush 1 (self-made Midland bidnessman, Yale grad and sports enthusiast with a bookish, plain-spoken wife whose project is literacy) was fired by voters when the economy foundered, and given that the Bush name was anathema in the G.O.P. for years, it is surreal that we may be only moments away from Bush 2 (self-made Midland bidnessman, Yale grad and sports enthusiast with a bookish, plain-spoken wife whose project is literacy).</p>
        <p>The world has been transformed in the last eight years, with cyberspace colonized and the Internet infiltrating every corner of life.</p>
        <p>And yet, the Republican gang that couldn't shoot straight on the economy is ready for its close-up.</p>
        <p>Angry white men have become fat, happy white men. And W., with his sunny emptiness and a tax plan that will protect the windfalls reaped in the Clinton-Gore years, is their guy.</p>
        <p>Now comes another antsy President Bush who reads sporadically and prefers reports to be delivered orally. It just proves the staying power of the Establishment. The insiders simply call themselves outsiders and say they disdain Washington and big government, and then gullible voters send the inside-outsiders right back here to make government bigger, their resumes longer and their private-sector contacts wider for future ''self-made'' cashing-in.</p>
        <p>The capital has been much duller since the nasty Congressional Republicans faded into the background. It was so exhilarating when Newt Gingrich and his helmet-haired henchmen were shutting down the government, eliminating school lunches, cutting granny's Medicare, impeaching the president and mocking Barney Frank.</p>
        <p>We lost sight of Newt's successors, those vivacious valets of viciousness -- Trent Lott, Tom Delay and Dick Armey -- when the Bush campaign hid them in a lockbox. But now we are on the verge of welcoming these bully boys front and center again, as they resume ramming their conservative agenda down America's throat.</p>
        <p>The Hill Republicans have been secretly sniggering at their nominee's blarney, all that chuckleheaded stuff about compassionate conservatism and bridging-the-partisan-gap.</p>
        <p>Civility is not their preferred special interest. And they think it will be easy to maneuver the tyro W., whose schedule could well make Ronald Reagan's look grueling, to be even more generous to pharmaceutical companies, monopolies like Microsoft, big polluters and big businesses looking to limit lawsuits.</p>
        <p>In Bush 2, we'll get to see more of that shrinking violet, Clarence Thomas. As one of President W.'s favorite justices, and as someone touted by conservatives as a potential chief justice in a Bush regime, he will come into his own. Perhaps the Anita Hill episode won't be the thing Justice Thomas is remembered for; perhaps overturning Roe v. Wade will.</p>
        <p>And it will be so reassuring to have Charlton Heston packing heat -- trigger treat! -- doing glam drop-bys at D.C. restaurants and dinner parties, once the N.R.A. opens up that office in the Bush White House it's been bragging about.</p>
        <p>I'm breathless with anticipation. How about you?</p>
