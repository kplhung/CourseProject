        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>About ''A Public Realm on Private Property'' [Oct. 15]: 39 years ago the good guys (the government) allowed the bad guys (landlords) to build bigger buildings in exchange for the buildings providing street-level plazas open to the public. The result has been mostly a failure. A few plazas were well kept. Most became homeless encampments and had to be locked up. Now a book is coming out that will list all those bad old landlords who are not keeping these spaces open and well maintained. In a hate-landlord town it should be a hit.</p>
