        <p>Waiting to die in the sunken submarine Kursk last August, a young Russian sailor scrawled a note describing how he and 22 others had rushed to a rear escape hatch only to find there was no way out. Divers found the note, written by Lt. Capt. Dimitri Kolesnikov, after recovering his body.</p>
        <p>Though the captain's handwriting became hard to read as emergency lights faded, his note proved that some of the 118 crewmen had survived for at least several hours after explosions destroyed the sub. Russian officials said the escape chamber was too flooded to use. But the note also reignited criticism of their bumbling rescue efforts.</p>
