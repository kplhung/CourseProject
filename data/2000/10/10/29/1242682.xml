        <p>A THREE-ACRE lot across Lafayette Avenue from the train station in Morristown that has long been used for parking has become an increasingly rare commodity: a buildable site at the edge of  the community's reviving central business district.</p>
        <p>To realize its potential, New Jersey Transit, which owns the property and is the overseer of the state's mass transit system, earlier this month selected a partnership between Roseland Property Company of Short Hills and Woodmont Properties of Parsippany to develop the site for apartments, parking and stores.</p>
        <p>Called Lafayette Commons, the $35 million project is to contain 226 rental units and 8,000 square feet of stores as well as parking for 780 cars. The architecture of the project, to be built over the next two and a half years, will blend with that of the buildings downtown as well as with the historic 1915 Renaissance Revival train station, which the developers will improve.</p>
        <p>Lafayette Commons is part of New Jersey's year-old transit village program administered by the state's Department of Transportation and the autonomous transit agency. The program seeks to attract private investment and spur mixed-use development within walking distance of transit hubs, many of which are often at the core of downtowns.</p>
        <p>Beyond Morristown, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman selected four other towns for transit village projects, which are in various stages of development near rail stations in Rutherford, South Orange and South Amboy and a bus depot in Pleasantville. All four of these projects are rising or will rise on privately owned land.</p>
        <p>Mark W. Gordon, senior director of real estate and economic development at the transit agency, said towns are chosen for the program where local leaders support transit friendly projects and are already involved in or are willing to proceed with such projects. He said the projects also must be within a quarter of a mile of the transit hub so that ''that people can live, work and recreate within walking distance of mass transportation.'' Other towns will be named to the program within the next six months, Mr. Gordon said.</p>
        <p>There have been earlier efforts by New Jersey Transit to encourage development around its stations. This program brings together 10 state agencies to help implement the projects, said James Weinstein, who is the commissioner of the Department of Transportation and chairman of New Jersey Transit. Involving the state agencies  may help speed the approval process, Mr. Weinstein said.</p>
        <p>Under the program, technical assistance is also made available to the participating towns, which are also given priority consideration for certain state and federal financing and grants. In the year since the program started, the State Transportation Department has awarded almost $3 million to the five communities, according to the department.</p>
        <p>THE program also reflects the state's efforts to respond to the growing anti-sprawl sentiments of residents in the last few years. Among those efforts is Governor Whitman's program to buy a million acres of open space in the next decade. And it conforms with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, which encourages growth in areas where roads, utilities and mass transit are in place and discourages it in less developed area.</p>
        <p>Developers and towns involved in the program agree with its aims. But some officials and developers said they were unsure of how much it had helped since a pool of specific money is not set aside for the communities to tap. They also said having so many agencies involved could increase, not decrease, governmental red tape.</p>
        <p>Stressing the need for the program, Mr. Weinstein said: ''We are at a point when we don't have the ability to add three more lanes to highways, so we have to look at ways to better capitalize mass transit. This program takes advantage of the inroads already made in the state's transit system.''</p>
        <p>Among the transit projects Mr. Weinstein expects to benefit through increased ridership encouraged by the transit village program is the Secaucus Transfer, which will link 11 of New Jersey's 12 commuter rail lines and allow passengers to transfer to trains for direct service to Pennsylvania Station. In doing so, Manhattan-bound commuters will bypass Hoboken, where they now must change to PATH trains, and shave up to 30 minutes from their commute. When completed in 2002, the project will increase the number of commuters using the historic 1898 Rutherford station, which is undergoing a renovation costing more than $1 million.</p>
        <p>The program also hopes to enhance ridership of Midtown Direct, a four-year-old express rail service from towns like South Orange and Morristown that also bypasses Hoboken and goes directly into Penn Station.</p>
        <p>In South Orange, local officials have been working with New Jersey Transit for five years on projects around the 1916 train station as part of a plan to revive the village's 12-block business district. Among them is the rehabilitation of a string of stores adjoining the Sloane Street Station. The transit agency also built a 275-car parking lot and sold part of the property to South Orange on which to build a planned $9 million arts center.</p>
        <p>That investment has led to a second round of projects, including the development of more than 200 residences on several downtown parcels, said John O. Gross, South Orange's administrator. ''Without a doubt,'' he added, ''our relationship with New Jersey Transit was instrumental in the downtown's revival.''</p>
        <p>In Rutherford, a four-story building for the Boiling Spring Savings Bank recently opened on a long-dormant two-acre bank-owned parcel a block and a half from the train station. It is the first phase of a larger project, planned several years ago, that will  include 48 rentals, more than 18,000 square feet of medical office space, a day care center and a 510-car garage with 160 spaces for commuters. Construction on those components are to start by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The project, on Orient Way, is at a gateway to the borough and is the cornerstone in its downtown revitalization, said Robert Gorman, Rutherford's administrator. ''Being designated a transit village helps a little  and we certainly would not turn our back on it,'' he said, adding that putting more financial resources behind the program would strengthen it.</p>
        <p>For the latest project in Morristown, local officials rezoned the parking lot site for its transformation into a transit village, enabling New Jersey Transit to put together a request for proposals to developers that could complement the new zoning. The transit agency will lease the site for 49 years with renewal options to the joint venture between Roseland and Woodmont, whose Lafayette Commons proposal was selected over four others.</p>
        <p>THERE are concerns the project will increase traffic in the area, six blocks from Morristown's historic center green. Still, Mayor John J. DeLaney said the project ''will bring people, life and vitality to the area and is part of the continued revitalization'' of the central business district.</p>
        <p>For the developers, having the project, which still must receive its local approvals, be part of the transit program ''will be helpful and expedite the pathway to the approvals,'' said Carl Goldberg, a partner at Roseland. He said the partners also got involved with the project because of Morristown's reviving downtown and its strong rental market.</p>
        <p>Construction of Lafayette Commons, which is being designed by the Hillier Group of Princeton, is to start by the end of 2001 and take 14 months. The 226 one-  to three-bedroom units with 800 to 1,350 square feet will be contained mostly in the upper floors of three buildings, each four stories high. The ground floors of the buildings, which will sit atop a parking garage, will be for the retail shops.</p>
        <p>There will also 10 town-house style rentals on Lafayette Avenue to hide the parking garage and provide a streetscape in keeping with those nearby, Mr. Goldberg said. Also, the design of all the buildings will blend with neighboring structures and incorporate some architectural elements found in them as well as in the historic train station across the street. Monthly rents have not yet been set.</p>
        <p>Because the rentals will be so close to the station and adjacent to the eastbound passenger platform, Mr. Goldberg said, ''Special windows, insulation, landscaping and construction techniques will be used to buffer the housing from a visual and sound perspective from the trains.''</p>
        <p>That will help broaden the market of potential renters for the units, said Eric Witmondt, a principal of Woodmont. He said they included young single and married professionals living in the area and working in Manhattan as well as New Yorkers looking for lower rents and a suburban alternative to Manhattan.</p>
