        <p>The nation's largest public pension system has given up tobacco.</p>
        <p>But it was not a desire to become politically correct that recently prompted the California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, to divest its $525 million in tobacco holdings. The investments just were not doing well.</p>
        <p>Phil Angelides, the state treasurer and a Calpers trustee and the leader of the divestment drive, says the holdings lost more than $500 million in value last year alone as cigarette makers fended off lawsuits by the federal and state governments as well as class-action suits.</p>
        <p>The Investor Responsibility Research Center says Calpers is the fifth state employee retirement system to divest or restrict its tobacco holdings.</p>
