        <p>ONE of the most noticeable improvements a homeowner can make is to restore a dull, scratched or discolored wood floor to a like-new luster. And since the necessary tools can be rented at most home-improvement centers, the work can be cost effective if care is taken.</p>

        <p>ONE of the most noticeable improvements a homeowner can make is to restore a dull, scratched or discolored wood floor to a like-new luster. And since the necessary tools can be rented at most home-improvement centers, the work can be cost effective if care is taken.</p>
        <p>''Refinishing a wood floor is a little like driving a car,'' said Bonnie Holmes, director of education for the National Wood Flooring Association in Ellisville, Mo. ''It looks easy, but you can end up with a mess if you're not careful.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Holmes said that the most common mistake homeowners make when trying to rejuvenate an old floor is to gouge and scratch the surface of the wood. ''Some sanders are very large and very heavy,'' she said, ''and you have to use just the right amount of pressure when using them or you can ruin the floor forever.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Ms. Holmes said, the first thing a homeowner with drab floors should do is determine whether the floor truly needs to be refinished -- which means sanding off the existing finish down to bare wood -- or whether it should just be recoated.</p>
        <p>''If you already have a polyurethane finish on the floor, and you catch it before the finish wears off completely, you may only need to recoat, not refinish,'' she said, explaining that most hardwood floors today have a coating of oil-  or water-based polyurethane that can easily be recoated.</p>
        <p>Bob Hammond, category director for the Minwax Company, an Upper Saddle River, N.J., manufacturer of paint and wood-care products, said that the first step in recoating a wood floor is called screening -- lightly sanding to remove scratches and gloss from the existing finish. In most cases, Mr. Hammond said, screening is done with a rotary floor sander -- a large, heavy machine with a rotating abrasive circular pad.</p>
        <p>Before trying to recoat a floor, however, a homeowner should first determine whether the existing finish can be recoated.</p>
        <p>''If your floor has ever been waxed, you will not be able to screen and recoat,'' Mr. Hammond said, adding that the wax will prevent the finish coat from adhering properly. He said it is possible to find out if the floor has a wax coating by wiping a small area with a rag dampened in paint thinner.</p>
        <p>''If the thinner removes the existing finish, the floor has a wax coating and will require complete sanding,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And that, it seems, is where most people get into the most trouble.</p>
        <p>Jason Ranney, the owner of Sanco Hardwood Flooring in Naugatuck, Conn., said that when people rent a floor-sanding machine they usually end up with a drum sander. Such a sander, he said, uses abrasive belts that are attached to a rubber-coated rotating steel cylinder. ''Most gouge marks I see are from the barrel of a rented drum sander,'' he said, adding that to use such a machine properly it is necessary to keep the machine moving whenever it is in contact with the floor. ''Once you lay that barrel down, you've got to keep on walking until you get to the wall and then lift the barrel off the floor smoothly.'' Mr. Ranney said that unless a consistent, delicate touch is used, a drum sander can easily leave scratches and gouges in the surface.  ''And these scratches will really show up when you put the finish on,'' he said, adding that it is always critical to sand in the direction the boards are running, never across them.</p>
        <p>Eve Blackburn, technical support director for the Flecto Company, a wood-finish manufacturer in Hickory, N.C., said that for those who would rather avoid using drum sanders, her company has a floor refinishing system available at most large home-improvement centers.  Included in the system is everything a homeowner needs to refinish wood floors -- including a flat-plate sander that is rented to the homeowner.</p>
        <p>The Flecto system sander, Ms. Blackburn said, has a flat, oscillating plate to which varying grades of sandpaper are attached using a self-stick adhesive. ''We provide four different grits,'' she said. ''You get 20, 36, 60 and 80-grit paper.'' The term grit is used to describe the abrasiveness of the sandpaper. Papers used in floor refinishing range from 16, the coarsest, to 120 and higher, the finest.</p>
        <p>In most cases, Ms. Blackburn said, it is best to start with the 36-grit paper -- as opposed to using the more abrasive 20-grit paper -- because the former will be better at cutting through the existing finish. ''After you go over the floor with 36-grit paper, you then switch to 20-grit paper to sand the finish completely off,'' she said, adding that once the finish is completely removed, the homeowner should use increasingly higher-numbered grit papers to ensure that all scratches made by the preceding sanding are removed.</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot of work and a lot of patience,'' Ms. Blackburn said, ''but you have to take out all the scratches before applying the finish.''</p>
        <p>Once the entire floor has been sanded (including the edges, which generally require the use of a hand-held sander) the floor should be thoroughly vacuumed and then wiped down with a moist rag.</p>
        <p>''I use a bunch of old, damp bath towels,'' Ms. Blackburn said, adding that it is also important to wipe down window sills and woodwork so that dust does not flow from those surfaces onto the finish.</p>
        <p>Once the floor is completely dry, she said, the finish can be applied using a lambs-wool applicator pad attached to a threaded broomstick.</p>
        <p>''Most people use oil-based or water-based polyurethane,'' Ms. Blackburn said, explaining that while an oil-based product generally takes longer to dry -- anywhere from four to 24 hours, depending on the brand and the weather -- it also gives the wood a subtle amber tone that many people prefer.</p>
        <p>Water-based polyurethane, on the other hand, dries in as little as two hours, but will not impart any color to the wood.</p>
        <p>''We recommend three coats of oil-based finish and four coats for water-based,'' she said. ''And we recommend lightly sanding with 80-grit paper between each coat.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Blackburn said that homeowners should be careful to follow the instructions on the can regarding the spread rate of the finish.</p>
        <p>''Make sure you're getting the right amount of product on the floor,'' she said. ''You don't want the finish to be to skinny.''</p>
        <p>In most cases, she said, refinishing floors oneself can cut the cost considerably. With contractor prices ranging from $1.50 to $3 a square foot, a 400-square-foot floor would cost from $600 to $1,200, she said. A homeowner doing the job himself, she said, would spend about $250.</p>
        <p>She said that homeowners applying an oil-based finish should also make sure there is adequate ventilation. ''And last but not least,'' she said, ''make sure you don't paint yourself into a corner.''</p>
