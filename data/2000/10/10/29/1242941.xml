        <p>WITH its running tableau of disasters, both man-made and natural, Africa in the 1990's has shown an unerring knack for inspiring hand-wringing in the outside world and increasing self-doubt among Africans themselves about the waste and futility of half a century of independence.</p>
        <p>Now, like an exclamation mark, the century may be closing on the descent into chaos of what has long been one of Africa's brightest corners, the former French West African country where a deeply flawed election last week produced rampaging mobs and ethnically motivated lynching, not democratic rule. By week's end, negotiations among the power seekers had begun, and an uneasy calm had taken hold. Still, the death toll was well over 100.</p>
        <p>The trouble in Ivory Coast could be seen coming for at least five years, visible on the horizon like the darkness of a gathering storm. But as predictable as the disputed vote and the killings may seem, they were never inevitable.</p>
        <p>Ivory Coast's crisis has its roots in the usual cynicism and blind ambition of politicians, but just as surely in the indifference of an onlooking world. Where Africa is concerned, it seems, extinguishing fires before they can get out of hand is scarcely ever tried.</p>
        <p>For most Americans, the name of this country with 17 million inhabitants means nothing. In fact, there are few places in Africa today that could give the world more reason to care. For a stretch of countries from Mauritania to Nigeria, Ivory Coast, despite its modest size, has been something akin to what the United States has often been to Latin America. It has absorbed many far poorer neighbors -- more than 25 percent of the population is now foreign. With its huge exports of cocoa and coffee, sizable industrial base, good roads and working electricity and telephones (such things are not taken for granted in Africa, even today), Ivory Coast has served as the region's employer, its breadbasket, its banker, its educator and its hub.</p>
        <p>For years, foreigners there have repeated the joke about loving to live in the capital, Abidjan, ''because it's so convenient to Africa.'' More important, though, this was one of those rare African places that had a large and worldly middle class.</p>
        <p>If Ivory Coast's slide goes unchecked, all that will vanish. One need only visit Liberia next door, with its skyscrapers full of squatters, to see what a gutted capital looks like, and to realize that what took generations to build can burn in a blink.</p>
        <p>Emulation has always worked powerfully in Africa politics. In the 1960's, an often well-intentioned but ultimately disastrous socialism was in vogue. In the 1970's and 1980's, leaders began naming themselves president for life. In the mid-1990's, with the Rwandan crisis, deadly mobilization along openly ethnic lines reared its head, spreading quickly through much of East and Central Africa.</p>
        <p>EVEN in faraway West Africa, Rwandization has become a familiar verb. For several years now, as in Rwanda, politicians have been playing to their ethnic bases, with the result that Ivory Coast is now seriously divided into three regions of roughly equal size: a Muslim north with cultural links to Mali and Burkina Faso, a Christian southeast, which has dominated the country's history, and a Christian and animist southwest with strong ancestral ties to Liberia and Guinea.</p>
        <p>If this sounds familiar, it should. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, broke down along almost identical lines, leading to the Biafran War in 1967. The fear of many Africa watchers is that even worse than the regional economic disaster it would occasion, an ethnic explosion of Ivory Coast would set a pattern for the region for years to come. In fact, Nigeria is facing a resurgence of ethnic violence now.</p>
        <p>''An Ivory Coast set ablaze by ethnic hatred will light a fire clear across this region,'' said one Western diplomat with longtime experience in West Africa. ''The only way to prevent it is for the world to engage all of the parties there and press them to respect some basic principles, especially the principle of compromise.''</p>
        <p>Many Africans have been waiting for France to lead an international effort to pressure Ivory Coast's factions to negotiate. But the wait has been in vain. The United States has condemned many of the worst abuses in Ivory Coast, where its interests are few. But France, without whose help the former colony's economy cannot run, has remained largely silent , providing support and justification for leaders even as their abuses have grown more flagrant.</p>
        <p>While Communism was falling in Eastern Europe a decade ago, much of Africa was experiencing popular revolutions of its own. In Mali, Benin, Congo and elsewhere, citizens who organized to demand democracy were overthrowing corrupt dictators.</p>
        <p>With little special outside help or attention, many of these early experiments in African democracy quickly foundered. But France, the only former colonial power to have maintained strong ties to its ex-possessions, worried that the end of personalized power under long-ruling dictators would open the region up to influence from others, notably the United States, and upset its interests in everything from oil fields to military bases.</p>
        <p>Early in the 1990's, Paris decided to stem its losses by backstopping corrupt regimes in Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Gabon, resource-rich states that provided handsome returns. With the implicit backing of the French President Jacques Chirac, who had already said that Africa was ''not ready for democracy,'' Henri Konan Bedie, the Ivory Coast leader who took power after the death of the country's founder, set out to eliminate his most important rival, a former prime minister named Alassane Ouattara.</p>
        <p>From 1995 until the end of last year, when he was overthrown in the country's first coup, Mr. Bedie ceaselessly improvised at eliminating his rival, a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Bedie invented a bogus ideology, called Ivoirite, which sought to distinguish purebred citizens, mostly deemed to be his own southern Christians, from supposed latecomers, especially northern Muslims like Mr. Ouattara.</p>
        <p>This played on long-standing, latent hatreds. Mr. Bedie's southeastern Akan group had enjoyed the fruits of education and ultimately the power that grew out of their early contact with French colonizers. The Akan, who saw themselves as natural rulers, thought of the Muslim northerners as a ''dirty'' people. The southwesterners were  disparaged as hotheaded near-savages.</p>
        <p>France never seemed to tire of Mr. Bedie, but the Ivorian people did. Last Christmas Eve he was overthrown in an army coup that seemed intended to right his wrongs. That is, until the new president, Gen. Robert Guei discovered the intoxicating effect of ethnic exclusionism. Soon, he, too, was changing the rules to keep Mr. Ouattara out.</p>
        <p>General Guei eliminated over a dozen rival candidates for the presidency, including those of the two largest parties, making a sham of this month's election. Having barred them from the race, the unpopular general was surprised to be soundly defeated in a low turnout by Laurent Gbagbo, a pioneer of the country's democracy movement.</p>
        <p>AFTER the stunned general sought to proclaim himself president anyway, his military government was literally chased from office by tens of thousands of supporters of Mr. Gbagbo, who now claimed power. But in a country badly divided along ethnic lines, this left two-thirds of the population dangerously disgruntled and unrepresented, setting up the terrifying street confrontations between supporters of Mr. Gbagbo and Mr. Ouattara.</p>
        <p>While much of the world, from Kofi Annan and the State Department to the South African President Thabo Mbeki and the Organization of African Unity called for new, free elections, the French government, which has always seemed more preoccupied with African power than with process, rushed to back Mr. Gbagbo.</p>
        <p>''Don't expect comments from us that could resemble a show of paternalism or lesson-giving,'' said a government spokesman responding to criticism by the French press for backing the winner of a bogus election out of pure expediency. ''It is not the French role.''</p>
