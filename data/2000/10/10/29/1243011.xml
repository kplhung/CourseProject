        <p>Jim Leedom stared at a placid October surf, watching gentle gray swells push toward the shore in the early morning light. An occasional mullet or rainfish could be seen dimpling in the otherwise quiet water.</p>
        <p>We stood with our surf rods checked over our shoulders like ballplayers waiting for a pitch, hoping that a school of false albacore might come sweeping down the beach. Neither of us spoke a word. Leedom had never taken one of these miniature tuna in the surf before. I had assured him he wouldn't soon forget the experience, if he was lucky enough to hook into one.</p>
        <p>A little more than 10 years ago, from this spot, I casually flipped a small bucktail jig into a pod of what looked like bluefish chasing silversides just beyond the breakers. I cranked the reel once, my rod lurched, and something that resembled a jade-green football streaked away in the general direction of Portugal, easily breaking off at around the 100-yard mark. It was my first ''albie,'' and I haven't been the same since.</p>
        <p>Now, each autumn after a strong cold front sends baitfish pouring out of estuaries and along beachfronts, I find myself standing wide-eyed, glaring at the sea in search of a telltale swirl or a shower of fleeing baitfish. Albacore distinguish themselves from surface-feeding bluefish and striped bass by frequently porpoising or even clearing the water in graceful leaps when they feed. Also, only terns seem to follow albacore schools; slower-paced gulls can't keep up.</p>
        <p>Once I had the opportunity to watch a dozen albacore repeatedly run the length of a breakwater at the mouth of an inlet, where a large shoal of rainfish had collected. The albies would charge the school in a tight formation, scattering the bait like cheetahs splitting a herd of gazelles. Each fish would then whirl around, picking off confused fish in violent gulps that would churn the surface white.</p>
        <p>Of course, this would usually happen just when I had cast in the opposite direction or was midway through tying on a new lure. Surfcasters quickly learn that albacore offer opportunities seemingly measured in nanoseconds, often occurring at the worst possible moments.</p>
        <p>Chasing albacore schools by boat is just slightly less frantic, as I recently found out while fishing with the guide David Blinken and Richard Reagan of the Norcross Wildlife Foundation. We spent the better part of the morning in a stiff sou'wester, throwing flies to breaking fish near Montauk Point, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Again, our casts would often unroll just as the fish erupted elsewhere. But other times, they would touch down dead-center into a maelstrom of feeding fish. When that happened, Blinken would yell for us to strip the flies as fast as we could. Inevitably, this would provoke an albie to rocket from its school and overtake the fly in a rush, sending Blinken belly-laughing, as Reagan or I helplessly watched 100 yards of backing disappear into the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Each of us landed perhaps a dozen fish that day. We frequently hooked up simultaneously, chasing our fish around the boat, passing our rods over each other's like some bizarre dance ritual. Blinken said such action is the norm during the peak of the season provided you have a boat and a guide to follow the schools.</p>
        <p>For a hardcore surf angler, however, catching half that many would justify some sort of plaque in a local tackle shop -- complete with the retired fly Scotch-taped to a blurry Polaroid. To some of us, a lonely beach or surging rip at the end of a jetty is still the best place of all to cast for albacore. Like raising a big trout on a dry fly, as opposed to racking up big numbers on a weighted nymph, each fish is a singular event. As one surfcaster told me, an albacore racing through the breakers is a different species from ones you can catch by the boatload just half a mile offshore.</p>
        <p>Which is also why I found myself with Leedom knee-deep in the Atlantic. With no fish showing on the surface, and the sun now up for over an hour, we decided to blind cast, retrieving small bucktails in sharp jerks. Since albacore key in on small baitfish such as sand eels, rainfish, and silversides, the tiny jigs we used seemed like perfect imitations of their prey.</p>
        <p>Leedom suddenly reared back as his rod bent double. His reel became a blur of vanishing line. I simply reeled in my lure and watched.</p>
        <p>Ten minutes later, he slid ashore a plump 8-pounder that shined purple and silver in the sunlight. He cradled the fish for a few moments, admiring its sickle-shaped tail, and dark green ''worm track'' along its back, perfect camouflage in the broken sunlight beneath the ocean's surface. Finally, he released it, watching it swim off with that wild-eyed look I knew all too well.</p>
