        <p>AFTER minor redecoration, Tamarind has moved into the moody space last occupied by Grill FX. If the departure of Grill FX and its menu of South African specialties has left a void in international offerings supplied by the many ethnic restaurants lining Main Street here, Tamarind has picked up the slack with an unusual collection of dishes covering all corners of Asia.</p>
        <p>There is a great deal of potential here; ingredients seemed fresh, and combinations sparkled, touched by distinctive additions like cilantro, coconut milk, lemon grass, tamarind, coriander and various chilies and basils. It was clear, however, on both our visits that this kitchen needed closer supervision. While some preparations had a nice balance, a few arrived drowned in a deluge of sauces. They muddied flavors and made sloppy presentation of quite a few otherwise appealing items. The menu invites diners to request the degree of spicy heat they want (in general, Tamarind's seasoning was mild), but this convenience seemed beside the point for food needing only better balanced seasoning and more careful application of sauces to be entirely satisfying.</p>

        <p>AFTER minor redecoration, Tamarind has moved into the moody space last occupied by Grill FX. If the departure of Grill FX and its menu of South African specialties has left a void in international offerings supplied by the many ethnic restaurants lining Main Street here, Tamarind has picked up the slack with an unusual collection of dishes covering all corners of Asia.</p>
        <p>There is a great deal of potential here; ingredients seemed fresh, and combinations sparkled, touched by distinctive additions like cilantro, coconut milk, lemon grass, tamarind, coriander and various chilies and basils. It was clear, however, on both our visits that this kitchen needed closer supervision. While some preparations had a nice balance, a few arrived drowned in a deluge of sauces. They muddied flavors and made sloppy presentation of quite a few otherwise appealing items. The menu invites diners to request the degree of spicy heat they want (in general, Tamarind's seasoning was mild), but this convenience seemed beside the point for food needing only better balanced seasoning and more careful application of sauces to be entirely satisfying.</p>
        <p>That being said, when the kitchen was attentive, preparations were as delightful as small, tender cockle clams piled in broth laced with ginger and lemon grass. Equally winning, tightly wrapped ''purses'' of goat cheese and a bit of duck were served on a array of crisp greens with ginger dressing. Once it was removed from a thickened, extremely salty sauce, marinated and grilled butterflied quail was excellent. Or begin with meaty Korean-style baby back ribs or spicy shrimp steamed in beer. Woven onto wooden skewers, strips of chicken sate came with traditional coconut and peanut dipping sauce, a standard item, as was a plate of sushi.</p>
        <p>As the weather becomes cool, braised lamb shank makes a hearty entree, and Tamarind's version was lovely and unusual with a complexity of Asian spices that put a pleasing spin on the meat. The accompanying risotto was, unfortunately, soupy.</p>
        <p>Light marination assured the tenderness of a terrifically tasty whole, stuffed game hen. Steamed in a banana leaf, a hunk of juicy salmon with pesto (this was a peppery mash of coriander, garlic, Thai basil and coconut) and a few vegetables made a healthful special that could have used more of the pesto to help punch up the flavor. For a rousing jolt, try Tamarind shrimp, with garlic-chili sauce. Diners with low tolerance should be aware that a ball of wasabi might be hidden like a land mine under a bed of greens, the underpinning for decent enough sashimi tuna sprinkled with sesame seeds.  Flooded by sauce, oily red snapper and ''family curry'' could be skipped.</p>
        <p>Desserts brought an odd lot.  Served with a flaming marshmallow, a silly idea, Flashback cake, a tower of tough chocolate based on crushed Oreos, was unimpressive. Instead, have ''Churchill cigar'' done in rich chocolate mousse. Creamy under a crackling top, creme brulee with adzuki bean was delicious, as was coconut ice cream, better without the rice curlicues. A pyramid of sorbet with cut fresh fruit was refreshing.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $38 without drinks, tax and tip. Tamarind is near Willett Avenue.</p>
        <p>Tamarind  112 North Main Street, Port Chester.  (914) 939-9103.</p>
