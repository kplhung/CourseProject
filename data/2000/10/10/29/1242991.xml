        <p>Last week was a tale of two markets. There was the Dow Jones industrial average. And then there was everything else.</p>
        <p>News that the pace of economic activity slowed considerably in the third quarter propelled the Dow sharply higher on Friday, as the index rose 210.50 points. For the week, the Dow gained 3.6 percent, to 10,590.62. So far this year, the Dow is down 7.9 percent.</p>
        <p>But worries about the effect a slowing economy might have on future corporate earnings seemed to hold back many stocks in the Nasdaq composite and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 indexes.</p>
        <p>That concern was particularly evident in highly priced fiber optic stocks. Nortel Networks, widely seen as the industry leader, saw its stock price fall 37 percent last week after it reported that third-quarter revenues were a smidgen less than Wall Street had expected.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq closed at 3,278.36, down 5.5 percent for the week. For the year, the Nasdaq is down 19.4 percent.</p>
        <p>The S. &amp; P. 500 fell 1.2 percent for the week, to 1,379.58. The index is down 6.10 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Some food for thought: It was the first week since June that the three indexes failed to move in the same direction.</p>
