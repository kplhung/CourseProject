        <p>NEW YORKERS are often accused of being addicted to the adrenaline rush. If that is true, here are four recent mystery novels with New York locales that might rev up the heartbeats of readers hereabouts.</p>

        <p>It was an old building, like the back cottage I lived in. The main floor had been gutted and made into a laboratory. Since the little back window had been dark, I guessed whoever I could hear now crossing the wooden floor lived there, and had been asleep. Had I awakened him? I thought I'd been silent. That seemed a joke now. I heard the floor creak again. Then someone sneezed. I held my breath.</p>

        <p>NEW YORKERS are often accused of being addicted to the adrenaline rush. If that is true, here are four recent mystery novels with New York locales that might rev up the heartbeats of readers hereabouts.</p>
        <p>THE WRONG DOG:  A Rachel Alexander  and Dash Mystery  By Carol Lea Benjamin  Walker &amp; Company  ($23.95, hardcover)</p>
        <p>It was an old building, like the back cottage I lived in. The main floor had been gutted and made into a laboratory. Since the little back window had been dark, I guessed whoever I could hear now crossing the wooden floor lived there, and had been asleep. Had I awakened him? I thought I'd been silent. That seemed a joke now. I heard the floor creak again. Then someone sneezed. I held my breath.</p>
        <p>Would he come down or go back to bed? I decided not to find out. Backing up to the window, I nearly tripped over a pile of magazines and newspapers tied with a cord and waiting to be set curbside for recycling. I couldn't help looking, to see if whoever lived here read The Wall Street Journal or Playboy. But neither was on top of the pile. It was Clone Magazine. Clever me, I'd found Side by Side.</p>
        <p>I tore off the cover and stuffed it into my back pocket, looking up at the ceiling and willing whoever was up there to go back to bed. But instead of hearing a door close, or the springs creak, I heard someone coming down the stairs.</p>
        <p>I slid the window all the way open, not bothering to close it behind me this time, getting our of the cottage as fast as I could. I never stopped moving, using the bench to give a boost up the brick wall, tossing myself over the top and landing with a thud in the ivy on the other side.</p>
        <p>Catching my breath, I saw him again. He'd been eating something in the center of the garden. The noise had made him stop and turn. For a moment, we stayed the way we were, two animals sizing each other up. Then he dropped to all fours and disappeared into the pachysandra.</p>
        <p>I ran across the garden, into Sophie's apartment and straight out her front door, stopping only when I saw another rat. This one was looking down at what he was doing, unlocking the glass door from the street.</p>
        <p>THE CHELSEA GIRL MURDERS:  A Robin Hudson Mystery  By Sparkle Hayter  William Morrow ($23, hardcover)</p>
        <p>Down at the front desk, the dark-haired, well-tailored tourist lady I'd seen before was asking questions while another of her flock stood nearby. There were still cops about and I saw one of the detectives from the night before coming out of the office of the manager, Stanley Bard.</p>
        <p>''There could be a murderer running around this place,'' the tourist lady said, alarmed.</p>
        <p>''Madam, we'll do our utmost to ensure your security,'' said the desk clerk. ''These things happen everywhere, but they rarely happen here.''</p>
        <p>The woman turned in a huff, pushing past me. Her friend followed. ''A man shot in our hotel. The horrible insane man outside the convention center, and those frightening teenagers fighting in Times Square last night? I don't know if I can make it through a week of this,'' she said. ''On the news this morning, they said there was a slasher on the subway, on the E train, the same subway we took two days ago.''</p>
        <p>I thought, How easy it is to tune into the things that confirm our prejudices, and tune out those things that challenge them. New York City was safer than most big cities these days. The odds of being killed by someone who was supposed to love you, however, were way up. Statistically, she was more likely to be harmed by the women she was keeping company with than by a subway slasher or a homicidal maniac.</p>
        <p>The city was cleaner than it used to be too, but this woman, who no doubt came from a gentle, sweet-smelling place where people only die from natural causes and gun-cleaning accidents, saw just the slashers and the murderers. The lack of small amenities. I felt bad for her, that she'd seen the dead guy on the floor. Probably, she'd never seen a murder victim before, and it can be quite a shock the first time, even if you've seen it a thousand times on TV shows or on the news. I felt bad in a more general way too, that she wasn't enjoying New York, a city I came to as a tourist and feel deeply in love with.</p>
        <p>THE DEATH OF AN AMIABLE CHILD:  An Anita Servi Novel  By Irene Marcuse  Walker &amp; Company  ($23.95, hardcover)</p>
        <p>There are moments in New York when everything seems to go quiet. No horns, no jackhammers, no radios, no car alarms, no cars even. The whole city shifts into neutral at the same time, inhales, pauses to reflect. It doesn't last long, and the background grind starts up again. We stood on the front stoop, blinking in the bright, silent air.</p>
        <p>''Seems like deja vu all over again, don't it?'' Michael took his hat off and scratched his head. ''Didn't we start the week on this stoop?''</p>
        <p>''Can I tag along when you talk to the Spragues?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>It was pushing my luck, and I knew it. There was no reason for me to be there, but I'd been on the edge of Regina's life all week and I felt I had a right to see the thing through. Find someone's dead body, you're responsible for her forever?</p>
        <p>HIT LIST  By Lawrence Block  William Morrow  ($25, hardcover)</p>
        <p>Keller knew Manhattan reasonably well, but his mental map of the outer boroughs was like a medieval mariner's map of the world. There were little floating pockets of known land and vast stretches inscribed ''Beyond this point there be monsters.'' He had a glancing familiarity with parts of Brooklyn -- Cobble Hill, because he's had a girlfriend there once, and Marine Park, from the time years ago when he'd belonged to a bowling team that competed (if you could call it that) in a league out there. He didn't really know Williamsburg at all, but recalled that the dominant ethnic groups were Puerto Ricans and Hasidic Jews in the southern portion and Poles and Italians farther north. In recent years, artists seeking low-cost loft space had been moving in. (''There goes the neighborhood'' went the cry -- in Spanish and Yiddish, Polish and Italian.)</p>
        <p>Declan Niswander lived on Berry Street, on Williamsburg's north side, just a ten-minute walk from the subway stop. Keller found the address, one of a row of modest three-story brick houses on the east side of the street. There were three bells at the side of the front door, which suggested that there was one apartment to a floor. Whether that was a lot of space or a little depended on how deep the Niswander house was, and you couldn't tell from the street.</p>
        <p>The block, and indeed the whole neighborhood, was in the process of gentrification, but it had a ways to go yet, and hadn't yet reached the tree-planting stage. Thus Declan Niswander, who painted trees so evocatively as to make a termite change his diet, lived on a block without a single tree. Keller wondered it if bothered him, or it he even noticed. Maybe trees were just something to paint, and Niswander put them out of his mind the minute he packed up his paints and brushes.</p>
        <p>Keller walked around, got a sense of the area. A block away he found a little Polish restaurant where he had a bowl of borscht and a big plate of pirogis, drank the large glass of grape Kool-Aid they brought without his asking, and, after a generous tip, still had change left from a ten-dollar bill. Dinner out here was quite a bargain, even when you counted the subway fare.</p>
