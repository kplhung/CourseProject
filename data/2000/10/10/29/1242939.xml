        <p>Really Public Hygiene</p>
        <p>. . . Firefighters would probably start gross decontamination of the victims using fog nozzles as soon as hoses were hooked to hydrants. . . . Optimally, rescuers would begin the decontamination process by instructing victims to disrobe. Even those in physical distress might object to taking off their clothes in public, so rescuers would have to explain . . . that taking off one's outer clothing can remove roughly 80 percent of the contamination hazard. . . .

        <p>No Room at the Emergency Room</p>
        <p>In many . . . cities, . . . the first action that hospitals said they would take after . . . a major hazmat event was to lock their doors and post security at all entrances. This lockdown policy was matter-of-factly stated. The priority from the hospitals' perspective is to prevent the compromise of the hospital due to contamination. . . . [But] few hospitals had a security staff large enough to contend with a major crush of ambulatory injured or panicked people. Therefore, hospitals said they would erect external barriers and call for police assistance if swelling crowds became unruly. . . .</p>
