        <p>HIS nine months leading Lincoln High School were among the most tumultuous in recent memory, but Horace Williams is unrepentant. Actually, he looks back at his work there with satisfaction.</p>
        <p>The school is changing, he said, which means he did what he was hired to do: Scores are up, teachers are taking pride in their work and students are moving in the right direction.</p>
        <p>At Lincoln, however, the staff and students say they are happy with the school precisely because Mr. Williams is no longer there. He now sits behind a desk in the Roosevelt school district on Long Island as interim superintendent.</p>
        <p>''If there are people who are happy that I'm gone, that's O.K.,'' Mr. Williams said. ''My role was to create change. The reality is that as long as the program succeeds, I don't care what people think or who gets the credit.''</p>
        <p>Apparently, State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills was impressed enough with Mr. Williams's work at Lincoln to personally tap him for the job on Long Island. Roosevelt schools, like several in Yonkers, are on the state's list of schools under review and have been for years. The district is in such disarray and students there have performed so poorly for so long that Roosevelt came under state control five years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams's task is to bring about change, and to do it in one year.</p>
        <p>''It's a long road, but we'll get there,'' he said, sighing over the phone from his office at 7 p.m., on his way to a meeting. The night before, Mr. Williams said, he hadn't returned to his Westchester apartment until nearly midnight. He is looking for a home closer to his new job.</p>
        <p>''If Lincoln was a challenge, then Roosevelt is, well, a real challenge,'' said Ira Schwartz, a coordinator for the state review program.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Andre J. Hornsby, Yonkers's former superintendent who hand-picked Mr. Williams for the job at Lincoln, is still looking for work.</p>
        <p>Ousted from the district last June after alienating teachers, school board members and Mayor John D. Spencer, Dr. Hornsby has applied for superintendent posts around the country -- including in his hometown, Tulsa, Okla. -- without success. He still lives in Yonkers, but did not respond to a message left at his home.</p>
        <p>For all their battles in Yonkers, student performance on standardized tests rose sharply at Lincoln under Mr. Williams, and increased somewhat across the district under Dr. Hornsby.</p>
        <p>But the school board president, Robert Ferrito, no fan of either administrator, fears that those improved scores are the result of teachers being forced to drill students with the tests in mind. The proof of that -- and, by extension, the Hornsby-Williams method -- will become apparent this year, Mr. Ferrito said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams's contract on Long Island, as at Lincoln, is for one year, but he said he had no problem with these short-term assignments, traveling from district to district as a quick-change man.</p>
        <p>''If I've done my job, it shouldn't matter who the administrator at Lincoln is now,'' he said, ''because the parents, students and teachers have taken ownership of the school themselves. That's the only way that the school was going to change -- or ever would have changed -- is if people become part of the process.''</p>
