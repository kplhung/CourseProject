        <p>It has been two months since the reopening of the Clark Street subway station, and the middle elevator is out of service. Again.</p>
        <p>''It's always the middle one,'' said a woman as she got into the packed elevator on the far left. ''You'd think, after all that work . . . .'' She frowned as the doors shut.</p>
        <p>''I was furious,'' said Sara Naison-Russell of Brooklyn Heights. When the Transit Authority closed the station for four months to replace the station's three elevators, ''it made my commute a half hour longer,'' she said. ''And now it's just the same as it was.''</p>
        <p>The closing had been a sore point among riders as well as merchants in the adjacent arcade, whose businesses suffered during the $3.5 million construction.</p>
        <p>Based on a report last month by the public advocate's office saying  new elevators in subway stations break down more often than older ones, Joseph G. Rappaport, the public advocate's transit adviser, said the travails of the Clark Street elevator were ''no fluke.''</p>
        <p>''New York City Transit would argue that, 'Oh, we're having a shakeout period,' '' Mr. Rappaport said. ''That may be, but the problem is, the shakeout period can last years.''</p>
        <p>While some new elevators work well, he said, ''it's not a shock to learn that a high-profile project like the elevator replacement at Clark Street hasn't gone as well as it might.''</p>
        <p>Melissa Farley, a Transit Authority spokeswoman, said while the Clark Street elevators have occasionally been closed recently, it didn't mean that they were necessarily broken.</p>
        <p>''There's a break-in period where we make adjustments,'' Ms. Farley said. ''But there was never a time when all the elevators were out.''</p>
