        <p>It has to be more than coincidence that the last two teams to win three successive World Series were owned by Charles O. Finley and George Steinbrenner. Talk about peas in a pod.</p>

        <p>It has to be more than coincidence that the last two teams to win three successive World Series were owned by Charles O. Finley and George Steinbrenner. Talk about peas in a pod.</p>
        <p>Actually, even though Finley, who died in 1996, and Steinbrenner engaged in a steady practice of firing managers, engendering animosity from their players and operating their teams in a hands-on manner, they are not twins. Steinbrenner makes some personnel moves on his own but has a coterie of aides he calls his baseball people; Finley was his own baseball person. Steinbrenner spends millions on players; Finley allowed his great team to disintegrate because he refused to pay his players even a small number of millions. Steinbrenner's players never wear anything but pinstripes; Finley's players couldn't get dressed until he decided which of the colorful array of uniforms they should wear.</p>
        <p>''Each day the clubhouse guy had to wait till he heard from Charley to tell us what uniform to wear,'' recalled Dick Williams, who managed the first two of Finley's three World Series championship teams.</p>
        <p>Whatever combination of Kelly green, California gold and Polar Bear white Finley concocted, the Oakland A's won. They won the World Series in 1972, '73 and '74 with a collection of players that was so good, that three of them are in the Hall of Fame -- Reggie Jackson, Jim (Catfish) Hunter and Rollie Fingers.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the individuals were better,'' Jackson said, comparing the three-time winners then and now. ''Collectively, when you put really good players together who know how to play great professional baseball, it makes for a great team. They know how to play the game.''</p>
        <p>Jackson, who is associated with the Yankees, played on those Oakland teams with Gene Tenace, Dick Green, Bert Campaneris, Sal Bando, Joe Rudi, Bill North and Ray Fosse. Ken Holtzman and Vida Blue joined Hunter in the pitching rotation. Fingers was the closer.</p>
        <p>''All he wanted was to win, just like George now,'' Williams said of Finley, the Indiana-born insurance man. ''Both are knowledgeable. Charley didn't have a group of people around him like George does. George has competent, talented baseball people around him. Charley did it himself. There was a baseball library at San Jose State University down the road. He used to get all different books and read up on them. He became very knowledgeable.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the Yankees, who swept San Diego and Atlanta the past two Octobers, the A's had to go to seven games to beat Cincinnati in 1972 and the Mets in '73. Like the Yankees' defeat of the Mets last week, the A's beat Los Angeles in five games in '74.</p>
        <p>In 1971, the A's won their division championship but lost to Baltimore in the league playoff series. In 1975, when the team also was the division champion, Jackson said, ''We got beat by a good Red Sox ball club.'' That season represented Oakland's last hurrah.</p>
        <p>''The A's were cut short because we ran into free agency,'' Jackson said. ''We all left. We were all kids. If that nucleus stayed together, we would have won another two times in the next five years, so we could have had five out of eight or something.''</p>
        <p>Those Oakland teams, as good as they were, were noted for their combativeness. They fought verbally with Finley; they fought physically with each other. In the clubhouse the day before Game 1 of the 1974 World Series, Fingers and John (Blue Moon) Odom had a fight.</p>
        <p>''We had some skirmishes,'' said Williams, who left after the 1973 World Series. ''I used to hop up on the desk to get out of the way. They might not have gone out together, but once they crossed that line they played together.''</p>
        <p>Jackson said no matter how the clubhouse might have appeared, the players' energy was directed toward winning. ''Certainly there were some personalities that clashed at times,'' he said. ''But more was made of it than it was. Even though it existed, it wasn't a distraction.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees championship teams of 1977 and '78 were related to those A's teams; the three-peaters are not. In fact, these teams managed by Joe Torre have been dull almost to the point of being boring. Hardly anyone even complains about not playing enough. These teams have been so successful they even lulled Steinbrenner into a frequently silent stupor. He has certainly not pulled anything that has been the equivalent of Finley's effort to fire one of his players during the 1973 World Series.</p>
        <p>Game 2 that year lasted 12 innings. The Mets scored four runs in the 12th, the last three on two errors by Mike Andrews, the backup second baseman. Finley, furious over the miscues, claimed Andrews had a shoulder injury and tried to replace him before Game 3 in New York. Bowie Kuhn, the commissioner, quashed Finley's attempt and fined him. The incident, roundly booed by the players, prompted Williams to resign immediately after the Series.</p>
        <p>''Andrews was the final straw,'' the former manager said.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner is based in Tampa, Fla., and Finley had his insurance business in Chicago. He saw the team play in Oakland less than Steinbrenner sees the Yankees play in New York.</p>
        <p>''After the game, win or lose, my phone always rang,'' Williams related. ''He had the game piped in on his WATS line. He never called the dugout. He'd suggest things. We fought over the second baseman another time. He didn't want Dick Green to come to bat. We had a roving second baseman. It nearly killed us against Detroit in '72. He wanted his designated runner.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner makes his preferences known to the manager, but Torre makes out the lineup and the owner hasn't proposed any gimmicks, like roving infielders and designated runners.</p>
        <p>''I think the guy who has his hand on the pulse every day is Joe Torre,'' Jackson said. ''I think the personality of the club as well as the character of the club is the image of Joe Torre. The way the players handled themselves is classy and in the Yankee tradition, the way they're managed and coached. They rely on each other. They count on each other and they go about the game in the true sense of the word professional.''</p>
        <p>Jackson and Williams chose the A's as the better team, though they acknowledged the eras have been different.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot harder now because you have to go through so many steps,'' Williams said. ''We had two teams then.''</p>
        <p>Jackson concurred, saying the extra round makes it tougher to get to the World Series. But he added: ''In the 70's, when the league championship series was three out of five, that was the most difficult, almost unfair. Three out of five is too hard.''</p>
        <p>The three A's championship seasons were fairly even leading to the World Series, each producing victory totals in the 90's. The Yankees have slipped from 114 victories to 98 to 87. Yet Jackson said he admired this year's team the most because ''nobody had a great year.''</p>
        <p>If it were possible for the A's of their championship seasons to play the Yankees of theirs, which team did Jackson think would win?</p>
        <p>''I like the A's because of the pitching,'' he said. ''I think it's about pitching. The similarities are so close. Let's say it goes seven games, the A's win in seven. Reggie drops one on them in the ninth.''</p>
