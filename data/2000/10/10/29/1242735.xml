        <p>WHEN I was growing up, Halloween was a one-day affair. We dressed up in costumes and went trick-or-treating. The most we expected, other than candy, was permission to stay up late to watch the Peanuts Great Pumpkin special.</p>
        <p>Today, Halloween is a long season so that retailers have something to sell and children have something to beg for between Back to School and Christmas. It started innocently enough with leaf bags shaped like pumpkins. Now, it looks like a tornado hit Party City and scattered the contents over every suburban nook and cranny.</p>

        <p>WHEN I was growing up, Halloween was a one-day affair. We dressed up in costumes and went trick-or-treating. The most we expected, other than candy, was permission to stay up late to watch the Peanuts Great Pumpkin special.</p>
        <p>Today, Halloween is a long season so that retailers have something to sell and children have something to beg for between Back to School and Christmas. It started innocently enough with leaf bags shaped like pumpkins. Now, it looks like a tornado hit Party City and scattered the contents over every suburban nook and cranny.</p>
        <p>Animated skeletons, witches and Frankenstein monsters twitch in people's yards for weeks. Green suburban plots turn into graveyards. Fake witches look as though they've crashed into trees and utility poles. Orange lights cover houses, bushes and trees. So do fake spider webs. Front steps become elaborate harvest scenes with enough haystacks and corn stalks for a Nashville hoedown.</p>
        <p>And then there are those seasonal flags, which seem to celebrate everything from Groundhog Day to National Broccoli Week.</p>
        <p>It's enough to make Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture, roll over in his grave. Or maybe that's his skeleton rattling the cage on Garden Avenue in Belleville, where Halloween is not just a holiday, but a cause.</p>
        <p>Marie Capolongo, who lives in the house with her daughter, son-in-law and two grown grandchildren (the youngest member of the household is 26), was on hand one day to show me how blood drips from the eyes of a front-yard ghoul into a cauldron. (Just colored water, she confided, after turning on a switch inside the house. Then, looking critically, she decided it needed more food dye.)</p>
        <p>Inside Mrs. Capolongo's house, there is a skeleton bride and groom, wall ornaments that laugh demonically, a dinner party for Frankenstein and orange kitchen curtains decorated in skulls and crossbones.</p>
        <p>I thought I had seen everything, but when I turned onto Maier Street, around the corner, I saw a scene in which a car bearing the words ''Just Married'' had been incorporated into a front-yard cemetery, with spider webs, a casket rising from the ground, and a tombstone asking, ''Who's next?''</p>
        <p>Get it? In my friend Jeff's yard, in Caldwell, the tombstone's joke was ''How's my driving?'' and ''I told you I was sick.'' Even in Glen Ridge, where the appearance police have stopped people in mid-siding jobs, the Halloween elves have been industrious. Some show typical Ridger restraint: one house on my street features plain electric candles, the kind displayed at Christmastime in front windows, but the flames are orange instead of white.</p>
        <p>This used to be the kind of town where autumnal excess meant that somebody got a little giddy ordering mums. Now, it has gotten to the point where everybody has to keep up with the Addamses. My children not only think I owe them a living and a new $29 costume every Halloween; they think I owe them their own personal graveyard too.</p>
        <p>''Just two,'' my 8-year-old son pleaded the other day. He was talking about gravestones, but you might have thought that the waif was begging for shoes.</p>
        <p>Of course, one person's Halloween tableau is another's Halloween nightmare. ''I would prefer an unadulterated landscape,'' said Carl Hintz, president of the New Jersey chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects. ''This has been going on with scarecrows and ghosts in the front yard. The question is, where does it end? At what point does it become like Christmas, with displays on their roofs and things?''</p>
        <p>Guess he hasn't been to Belleville lately.</p>
        <p>Of course, even hard-core Halloween decorators have standards. Tim Ghiselli of DuBrow's Nurseries in Livingston thinks the flags that hung from the porches of yuppie couples are passe. He, on the other hand, has spent months making what he calls quality Halloween lawn ornaments. His most elaborate creation is a graveyard scene with five tombstones and a 16th-century woman being bitten by a vampire (both life-size). It's all plywood and goes for $1,200.</p>
        <p>''Because I love Halloween and because I'm an artist, I don't like going into stores and seeing things that are cheap and cheesy,'' Mr. Ghiselli said.</p>
        <p>Call me the Ebenezer Scrooge of Halloween, but it all looks cheesy. I wouldn't mind a visit from the Ghost of Halloween Past. He'd bring candy corn and sit with me on the porch, rattling his chains and lamenting the days when grown-ups were in charge. After all, it's not as if nature doesn't provide its own spectacular show this time of year.</p>
