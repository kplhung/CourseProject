        <p>To the Editor: I can recall, with much pleasure, the sailings I made with my family. The first was in the summer of 1934 when we left Hoboken, N.J., on the Holland America Line for Rotterdam. The departure was scheduled at midnight (which they often were at that date). Friends arrived in black tie, we ate gorgeous hors d'oeuvre, Champagne was served, and it was all a great gala party. Very formal and very classy!</p>
