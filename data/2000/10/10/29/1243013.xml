        <p>Last year, ''NFL This Morning'' was a promising Sunday studio show on Fox Sports Net from 11 a.m. to noon, Eastern time, starring Chris Myers, Marv Levy, Jackie Slater and Chris Spielman.

        <p>Last year, ''NFL This Morning'' was a promising Sunday studio show on Fox Sports Net from 11 a.m. to noon, Eastern time, starring Chris Myers, Marv Levy, Jackie Slater and Chris Spielman. Levy, the brainy former Buffalo Bills coach, and Slater, the insightful former Rams offensive lineman, were the emerging stars.</p>
        <p>A viewer could almost envision the program as the calm, reasoned younger cousin to the Fox network's raucous yet adroitly produced ''Fox NFL Sunday,'' which stars Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, James Brown and Cris Collinsworth, who have been adapted into Claymation toys to promote the National Football League pregame studio show.</p>
        <p>But the hope for continued sanity or journalistic growth at ''NFL This Morning'' ended with four changes: adding an hour, from 1O to 11 o'clock, an informal new set, a dress-down dress code, and the addition of four faces, including the comic actor Jay Mohr, as the ''Breakfast Bunch,'' who sit in club chairs amid the clutter of Sunday newspapers. They would probably belch their college fight songs if they were given the green light by management.</p>
        <p>The show is now a two-hour calamity with a cast encouraged to be crude and spontaneous. It frequently descends into a chorus of loons shouting at each other like kindergartners without their recess milk or a contest over which galoot on the set can beat the other up.</p>
        <p>''Can we please, please have a football show?'' Slater asked last Sunday. No, you can't, because you're stuck in a desperate attempt to pander to teenagers for whom all other pregame shows are apparently deemed too strait-laced, statistics-oriented or intelligent, as if ''NFL Gameday'' on ESPN were like a pigskin version of nuclear physics lectures by Niels Bohr.</p>
        <p>''It may be the biggest disaster of all time,'' said David Hill, chairman of the Fox Television Sports Group. ''But people are talking about it.''</p>
        <p>Through the first four weeks, the rating for the 11-to-noon hour is up, from a slim 0.31 last year to a 0.38 (about 266,600 households). One rating point equals about 700,000 households.</p>
        <p>Studio shows before N.F.L. games have been evolving steadily (and now rapidly) into entertainment vehicles. CBS's ''NFL Today'' moved outdoors this season and last week invited Sammy Hagar to sing in the studio plaza; we all know that Hagar's music and persona are synonymous with football enjoyment.</p>
        <p>''Fox NFL Sunday'' has stars capable of handling humor and raucousness -- if any show had earned the right to stretch to two hours, this was it -- but lately it has branched into tastelessness, with Jimmy Kimmel delivering weekly picks naked or with his head between his legs, and sleaze, with a buxom weatherwoman, Jillian (''I'm not a meteorologist!'') Barberie, whose sole purpose in replacing last year's trained Weather Channel meteorologist is to tease Bradshaw &amp; Company into giggly, gaga-eyed goofiness.</p>
        <p>''NFL This Morning'' features Mohr looking as if he dressed in the dark and hired perhaps to amortize his contract from the short-lived ''Action,'' a Fox program about Hollywood; Levy delivering scripted lines and doing sketches with Mohr that embarrass the gray eminence; Spielman being marginalized because he seems unwilling to join the spiraling madness; and Mohr plus the former players Sean Jones, Billy Ray Smith and Bob Golic (who can never escape references to his role on the ''Saved by the Bell'' series) in a mock den with Mohr screaming like ''The McLaughlin Group'' on a weeklong bender.</p>
        <p>The crassness comes with commentary weighed down by similes that lack a foundation in reality and sound like losing entries in a ''Why I Want My Locutions to Sound Like Dennis Miller's'' contest.</p>
        <p>Of the St. Louis offense, Myers said, in one of the less graphic such references, ''The Rams score more than George Clooney in a singles bar.'' (Go ahead, damn him because he's handsome!)</p>
        <p>Mohr on Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive back John Lynch: ''He hits people like they stole his mother's lunch money.'' (Don't mothers give lunch money to kids who get it filched by bullies?)</p>
        <p>Levy is victimized by his, or the show's, dreadful writing. He said the San Francisco 49ers' defense was ''weaker than a forced apology.'' On the Miami Dolphins' defense, Levy said, ''I haven't seen a defense like this since Johnnie Cochran.'' (A simile as weak as a forced apology.)</p>
        <p>Although associated with this mess, Slater emerges with barely a scratch. He has developed a winning, even evangelical style, and a shtick that serves him well in the show's only watchable segment: his play analysis using animated video game footage adapted to include N.F.L. players by Electronic Arts.</p>
        <p>Hill described the show as a laboratory to figure out what appeals to men between 18 and 25 years old.</p>
        <p>''There's a sea change going on in how they receive entertainment, and I'm looking to crack it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With a small audience, Hill feels he can tinker with some rather outrageous programming impulses without being widely scorned for his mad experiment.</p>
        <p>''You have to take risks,'' he added. ''No one is making anyone watch it, but a surprising number of people have discovered the first half-hour.''</p>
