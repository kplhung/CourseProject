        <p>All Gong stamped himself as a contender for steeplechaser of the year yesterday when he took the lead approaching the 12th fence and then galloped out to win the $250,000 guaranteed Breeders' Cup Steeplechase in Far Hills, N.J.</p>
        <p>Ridden by Blythe Miller, All Gong, a 6-year-old British-bred gelding, finished 3 1/4 lengths in front of Popular Gigalo in the race at two and five-eighths miles over 14 national hurdles.</p>
        <p>Nine horses contested the first running of the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase since 1993. Miller also won that one, with the five-time Horse of the Year Lonesome Glory. She kept All Gong well within striking distance of the leader, Campanile, for the first two turns. All Gong made his move down the backstretch the second time and collared the leader before the field hit the far turn the final time. All Gong was clocked in 4 minutes 53 4/5.</p>
        <p>Popular Gigalo, trained and ridden by Miller's brother, Chip. finished 1i lengths ahead of All Grit, ridden by Joseph Delozier III.</p>
