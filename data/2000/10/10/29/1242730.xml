        <p>FOR the more than 130,000  county residents with roots in  Italy  or for those who are  simply lovers of things Italian -- the Festa Italiana today at Westchester Community College here may be the ideal way to spend a  Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The festival, presented by Il Club Italiano of the Community College, features music, exhibits, films, lectures and food, all related to Italian culture, in the Classroom Building of the college next to Parking Lot 4. At 1 p.m., and again at 3:30 p.m., Stephen Conte, a genealogist, will discuss how to trace Italian ancestors.</p>

        <p>FOR the more than 130,000  county residents with roots in  Italy  or for those who are  simply lovers of things Italian -- the Festa Italiana today at Westchester Community College here may be the ideal way to spend a  Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The festival, presented by Il Club Italiano of the Community College, features music, exhibits, films, lectures and food, all related to Italian culture, in the Classroom Building of the college next to Parking Lot 4. At 1 p.m., and again at 3:30 p.m., Stephen Conte, a genealogist, will discuss how to trace Italian ancestors.</p>
        <p>There will also be lectures on subjects like ''The Life and Times of Enrico Caruso,'' ''The Role of Italy in the Unification of Europe'' and ''The Wines of Italy.''</p>
        <p>m.</p>
        <p>If this whets the appetite for even more things Italian, similar events are scheduled through the spring, said Prof. Carlo Sclafani, acting chairman of the Italian Department at the college.</p>
        <p>He organized the Italian club 29 years ago when he came to the United States from Sciacca in Sicily, adding that close to 40 percent of the 20,000 students at the college traced their heritage to Italy.</p>
        <p>Countywide, the Department of Planning reports that 104,430 of the county's 860,000 residents trace their primary ancestry to Italy.</p>
        <p>Members of the college's Italian club have traveled to the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy in Manhattan, been the hosts of folklore shows and lectures at the college and marched in Columbus Day parades.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the club will show the Italian comedy, ''The Monster,'' starring Roberto Benigni. The film, with English subtitles, will be shown in Classroom Building 200 at 7:30 p.m. Admission is free.</p>
        <p>''Interest in our offerings keeps growing,'' Professor Sclafani said.</p>
        <p>The club offers Italian language courses for children and their parents, English programs for the foreign-born and courses in Italian conversation for the general public.</p>
        <p>For information about the Italian Club, contact Professor Sclafani at (914) 785-6790.</p>
