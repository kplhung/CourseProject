        <p>ALL the road signs and billboards in Sokch'o, a small city on Korea's east coast, were a mystery to me, since I don't read Hangul, the Korean alphabet. But I imagined that one of them proclaimed: ''Sokch'o: Exfoliation Capital of the World.'' Only two days after my arrival in this region, where rocky mountains  tumble to a wide, sandy seacoast, my skin had turned a shade of hot pink, thanks to vigorous scrubbings, followed by repeated plunges into water hot enough to leave me feeling lightly poached.</p>
        <p>Much of the Korean peninsula is a dramatic landscape of rugged, pine-covered mountains, large tracts of which have been turned into national parks and recreation areas by the government. Koreans, enthusiastic hikers and outdoors people, flock to these mountain preserves on weekends and holidays to enjoy nature, visit centuries-old Buddhist temples, eat ''mountain food'' (wild vegetables and mushrooms that grow only in high elevations) and soak in hot mineral waters. Public bathing is even more central to the culture in chilly Korea than it is in nearby Japan. ''We are bath people,'' a Korean told me, laughing.</p>
        <p>I had spent six days in Seoul, the capital, at the start of my trip to the country in September -- exhilarating but challenging days. Korea isn't an easy place to negotiate if you don't understand the language, and very little English is spoken outside the major hotels. Still, I was keen to get to know Korean culture more intimately. I figured that taking off my clothes and scrubbing my elbows in the company of a hundred or so Korean women would be one way to sidestep the language barrier.</p>
        <p>And so early one morning I boarded a ''super express comfort'' bus at the station in downtown Seoul, bound for Sokch'o, the nearest city to the main entrance of Soraksan National Park. The park, spread over more than 135 square miles, is the most famous of Korea's natural preserves; it also contains two popular hot springs resort areas, Choksan and Osaek.</p>
        <p>While collecting maps and leaflets at the Korea National Tourism Office in Seoul, I happened to mention to the woman on duty, a Miss Park, that I was interested in spending a few days exploring the Soraksan area. I told her where I wanted to stay and when, and she immediately offered to help by calling the reservation desks of the hotels I'd chosen. Thanks to her generous initiative, which was typical of the hospitality I found in Korea, I was soon set for two nights at Choksan Hot Springs Resort, near the Sokch'o entrance to the park, and two nights at the Green Yard Hotel, near the Osaek Hot Springs park entrance.</p>
        <p>She was on the phone speaking in Korean with the Green Yard Hotel for a while. I asked her if there had been a problem.</p>
        <p>''No,'' she replied. ''I was getting the price cheaper for you.''</p>
        <p>Without my even mentioning that I was on a budget, the formidable Miss Park had gotten me a saving of about $25 a night at the Green Yard, the fanciest resort hotel in the Soraksan area. That brought the rate of my single there down to $50 a night; the Choksan Hot Springs would be $36. The modest prices reflected the fact that I was visiting popular middle-class Korean resorts, not resorts aimed at free-spending foreign tourists.</p>
        <p>My luck with the weather wasn't as good. After a zippy four-hour bus ride across the Korean peninsula, I could just make out Sokch'o's fishing harbor and skyline punctuated by fabulous fantasy castle towers (the turrets signal that these are ''love hotels,'' where you pay by the hour). But mostly the scenery was a white curtain of water and fog. Because of the rain, I just jumped in a cab, handed the driver a slip of paper with the directions to the hotel written in Korean (thank you, Miss Park), and $5 and five minutes later I was unpacking in my room.</p>
        <p>They were ready for me; mine was the only non-Korean name they'd seen on their register for some time, the desk clerk allowed in response to my question. Although most of the rooms were Korean style, with cotton batting mattresses that are spread out on the floor by night, then folded up and stuffed in a closet by day, my door opened onto a ''Western'' room, that had a standard-issue double bed.</p>
        <p>When I saw it, my first reaction was to ask to switch. But that would have entailed a complex bit of gesturing and trying to pronounce phrases in the Korean-English dictionary I'd lugged along. What's more, it occurred to me that management had placed me in the room as a courtesy; they wanted their foreign guest to feel at home, and this was their way of showing it.</p>
        <p>Anyway, the room was quite nice, with a window that looked out to mountaintops occasionally visible through thick white fog. The floor, of tan linoleum, was slightly higher than the floor of the corridor, so clearly, despite the bed, the room was a traditional Korean space. The linoleum covers cement, which is permeated by a network of water pipes; when the weather turns cold, hot water is pumped through the pipes, which turn the floor into a large flat radiator.</p>
        <p>This method, called ondol, is the way most Korean homes are heated. In an ondol room, you don't leave anything on the floor that you don't want cooked, at least in the winter when it's functioning. Because I was there in September, I doubted I'd get the chance to experience ondol heat.</p>
        <p>There was a private bathroom, modern and clean, in my room. It had a shower, and even a deep tub, neither of which I ever used, because shortly after arranging my things I hurried downstairs to the basement of the Choksan hotel to begin my education in Korean bath culture.</p>
        <p>I entered a standard-issue locker room, where a middle-aged woman in a pink apron smiled when I approached her with a hearty ''Anyong haseyyo!'' -- ''Hello'' is the only Korean word I can say, so I say it with conviction. She handed me a locker key on an elastic loop, a sliver of soap, and a towel the size and texture of a dish towel.</p>
        <p>Looking around, I noticed that all the women were completely naked -- at a Korean bath, you check your modesty at the door, and the towel is for scrubbing, not drying or draping.</p>
        <p>After stripping down, I tentatively stepped through steamy glass doors, into the world of the baths -- a large, noisy cheerful area where about 100 women of all ages and small children of both sexes were scrubbing, chatting and soaking. To one side were rows of washing stations, with faucets, hand showers and mirrors set low to the ground. (Koreans, like Japanese, sit while washing). Over on the other side were seven large steaming tubs, each with a digital sign overhead that displayed the exact temperature, in Celsius, of its waters.</p>
        <p>I knew the drill from Japan. You wash yourself first, rinsing off all traces of soap, before going over to dunk yourself in the mineral water. I grabbed a plastic basin from a pile near the door, found myself a vacant scrub station and lathered up. While doing so, I noticed that my neighbors at the next faucets were attacking themselves with loofahs as if their skin were a grimy kitchen floor. I began to scrub myself a bit harder, getting into the swing of things. After about 10 minutes of this, I decided I really didn't want to remove an entire layer of skin in one day. Rinsing, I walked carefully across the wet granite floor to the tubs.</p>
        <p>I like baths hot. But I'm not good at doing Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions in my head. Over in the tub marked ''41'' a lady who looked to be in her 80's lazed contentedly; this looked like the place for me. I approached, plunged and leaped out just as my blood began to bubble. The woman looked up at me and laughed; I scurried over to the tub marked ''39,'' which I later learned was 102 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>In the morning, pounding rain had eased to a relentless, fine drizzle. After several hours of scrubbing and soaking in the hot tubs, getting wet outside didn't seem so daunting. So I put on a rain parka and a knapsack, and took two buses from the hotel  to the main entrance of Soraksan Park, about 30 minutes away. Although there's usually an entry charge of about $2, the guard waved me through; I think he gave me  the soggy-foreign-tourist discount. I passed a few pairs of walkers, wrapped head to toe in see-through plastic parkas, but otherwise was completely alone as I trod one of Korea's best-loved paths, past Shinhungsa temple, the oldest Buddhist monastery in the country, whose entrance is guarded by brightly painted, scary temple demons.</p>
        <p>The walk leads up gently, through a serene landscape: pine forest in the mist, the roar of rivers gushing over huge, tumbling boulders, surprise encounters with imposing Buddhist hermitages. (The serenity, alas, is interrupted at two points by snack bars and restrooms.) After a couple of hours, I reached the Gyejoam Buddhist hermitage, built on a rock ledge at the base of a steep trail that leads up to Ulsanbawi rock, the bare-rock mountaintop that's one of the most famous picture postcard vistas in Korea. It was a vista that remained a mystery to me, shrouded in the swirling fog and relentless rain.</p>
        <p>I thought I was alone, but then, in the stillness, a lone voice began to sing, sweetly, a Buddhist prayer. I peered inside the dark entryway of the hermitage; an old monk was singing sutras. For a moment I lingered in the rain, transfixed.</p>
        <p>(I repeated the walk the next day, a sunny Sunday, and finally did see Ulsanbawi's bald stone pate, thrusting up above thickets of dark green forest. But this time I shared the scenery with hundreds of Korean day trippers, whose presence made it more of a group event than a private meditation, and at the hermitage the voice of the lone monk had been supplanted by recorded tapes of chanting.)</p>
        <p>Osaek Hot Springs, the other thermal area in Soraksan Park, is not far from Choksan as the crow flies, but the two areas are separated by mountains, so it is a roundabout route, about 25 miles by secondary roads; I changed hotels in a taxi ($27). Upon sighting the huge, steel-and-glass chateau-moderne Green Yard Hotel, I felt a pang of dismay. I'd heard that Osaek was less touristed than the north end of Soraksan, and I expected to find a town of little mountain cottages.</p>
        <p>But once I'd settled in to my comfortable room (ondol with Western bed) at the Green Yard, I began to see the upside of the glitz. The hotel, and Oseak, is a popular vacation spot of the Korean professional class, many of whom have studied in America, speak English well, and offered friendship and help whenever I met them in the hotel or on the nearby trails. They steered me to sublime treats, like the hot, syrupy Korean herb tonics that vendors hawk near the entrances to the steep mountain trails. (And one of them just ''happened'' to turn up at 6 a.m. in the lobby on the morning I was to return to Seoul, to hand me a paper of instructions, written in Korean, for the bus ticket seller.)</p>
        <p>The menus in the little Korean restaurants in the hotel's basement food court even had English translations, so I was able to sample some of the local delicacies, like soup and noodles made with a special mushroom that tastes, faintly, of pine needles. The Green Yard's bath complex, larger and slightly more luxurious than the Choksan's (there you got two dish towels), had an enormous, piping hot sauna, hung with fragrant bunches of wild mountain herbs.</p>
        <p>I hiked, on gentle and incredibly picturesque short trails, through rock formations and gushing waterfalls (there are longer, more challenging trails around Osaek, but they are quite rocky and steep and I hadn't brought boots), then returned  to the baths, exfoliated dutifully, dunked into hot water and dried to a crisp in the sauna.</p>
        <p>At night I fell into my Western  bed, pulled up the covers and dreamed of hot places, desert sands, warm tubs, and of melting like Velveeta between two slices of toast. Dreaming of myself as a toasted sandwich is pretty strange, I thought, half asleep, watching the flat silver spatula descending to press me to the grill. Suddenly my brain snapped to attention. The ondol! The hotel had turned on the ondol heat. I jumped up, and sure enough, the soles of my feet hit a linoleum griddle. A minute later, after I had safely removed my luggage, film and camera to the ondol-free floor of the entryway, I returned to bed, and to the warmth of Korea.</p>
        <p>The bottom line in the 'exfoliation capital'</p>
        <p>For my four day, four-night trip into the Korean countryside my total expenses for everything -- hotel, meals, taxis, admissions and round-trip bus fare from Seoul to Sokch'o city -- came to $310, at 1,100 won to $1.</p>
        <p>Transportation</p>
        <p>The Seoul Express Bus Terminal in downtown Seoul (it has its own subway stop) is marked in English and is fairly user friendly. There are two classes of service between Seoul and Sokch'o, ''express'' and ''super express comfort,'' -- differingin the size and number of seats. Buses leave at least hourly during the day from the stations in Seoul and in Sokcho. The one-way fare is $17 on super express comfort buses, about $5 less on express.</p>
        <p>Hotels</p>
        <p>The Choksan Hot Springs resort (82-33) 636-400, fax (82-33) 636-4007 is about three miles outside Sokch'o; when booking, ask the hotel to fax a map with directions for the taxi driver. My ''Western'' room, about 12 feet square, had a very comfortable double bed, refrigerator, and private bath with a shower and a deep tile tub. The management didn't speak much English, but was extremely friendly and helpful. The room rate of $36 included tax and service, and use of the hot mineral bath and spa. .</p>
        <p>The Osaek Green Yard Hotel (82-33) 672-8600, fax (82-33) 672-0480, is a sprawling resort complex tucked into the mountains near Osaek Hot Springs, inside the boundaries of Soraksan National Park. The main, chateaulike building contains apartments with kitchens that rent for around $85 a night. Next door to this complex is an annex of simpler, Korean-style rooms (some with Western beds) that rent for $50 a night (including tax). The hotel will book you in the main section unless you ask for the annex. My room in the annex was similar in comfort, size and amenities to the one I had at the Choksan Hot Springs hotel. At the Green Yard, the basic rate does not include admission to the spa and baths ; each entry costs $3.75.</p>
        <p>Food</p>
        <p>Menus are usually not in English, although some have pictures; Western-style food is not much in evidence. Since the area is famous for its wild mountain vegetables, I often ordered bibimbap, a hot iron bowl filled with rice, vegetables, hot pepper paste and sesame oil, that you mix and eat at the table. Another delicious specialty is mountain herb tea, a syrupy brown restorative tonic.</p>
        <p>The restaurant at the Mount Sorak Tourist Hotel at the main park entrance, (82-392) 636-7101, serves an especially tasty bibimbap. Lunch, including a large OB Korean beer, is around $11.</p>
        <p>In the basement level of the Green Yard Hotel, just outside the spa entrance, is a little food court with a few small restaurants. One, the Good Restaurant, (82-33) 672-5621) specializes in dishes that feature pine mushrooms, a delicacy that grows only in the Sorak area. My lunch was about $6.50, with a little glass of the local homemade wine (sweet and medicinal-tasting) thrown in. The menu has an English translation.</p>
        <p>A five-minute walk from the Green Yard hotel, at the approach to the trailhead for the Osaek Springs, is a strip of outdoor restaurants that specialize in fish dishes. The river fish are in glass tanks; you point at what you want, and it shortly appears fried on your plate with a flotilla of little side dishes A meal at the San-Kul restaurant (there's no telephone, but it's the last place in this ''restaurant row'') cost about $12 with beer.</p>
        <p>Soraksan National Park</p>
        <p>It costs about $2 to get into the park from the main entrance.</p>
        <p>The park information offices at both entrances have free trail maps in Korean, English and Japanese. Information: (82-33) 636-7700.</p>
        <p>Local transport</p>
        <p>With some guidance from the hotel staff at Choksan Hot Springs resort, I learned to get around Sokch'o and into the park on the local public buses. The bus stops right outside the hotel and the fare is 55 cents.</p>
        <p>The Green Yard Hotel has a free tourist bus that makes several runs a day between the hotel, the Sokch'o Express bus station and Sokch'o city.</p>
