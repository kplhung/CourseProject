        <p>BRONXVILLE, well known for its exceptional schools, upscale shops and restaurants, once had another reputation: as a burgeoning art colony. Going back as far as the 1850's, artists settled here because it was picturesque and a quick commute from New York City via the newly constructed railroad.</p>
        <p>William van Duzer Lawrence, an entrepreneur, purchased Prescott Farm in 1899, marking the formal beginning of an organized artist colony called Lawrence Park. He enticed other successful artists to look at Bronxville as a summer retreat, a place to build a home and studio without relinquishing their profitable studios in New York City. Much later, when his wife, Sarah, died, he started a women's college in the Lawrence Park West section of Yonkers called Sarah Lawrence College.</p>
        <p>Today, Lawrence Park is known as the Hilltop section of Bronxville, a commercial district rather than an artists' settlement. Still, the tradition of artists living in Bronxville continues, and so does the women's club's practice of holding monthly, changing exhibitions of both neighboring and Bronxville artists. In November, the club will exhibit the work of three of Bronxville's own -- Robert Abele III and Michael Prendergast, both painters, and John Horne, a photographer -- as well as a sculptor from nearby east Yonkers, Cordes R. George.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Abele's last exhibition at the Bronxville Women's Club, he sold 32 paintings, raising money needed for the upkeep of the building. ''I was asked to do another show there, to try to rejuvenate the club,'' he said. ''It was then, that I thought to invite three of my artist-friends to co-exhibit.''</p>
        <p>They were eager to do so, in part to raise awareness of ways to make Bronxville a more artist-friendly community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abele said that he and the other three artists were all placed in arts programs as schoolchildren because they were classified as learning disabled. ''We flourished in that environment,'' he said. ''We needed to be taught visually. Unfortunately, I don't see that kind of support today, now that we are struggling adult artists. I know, that it's no big news for an artist to complain about a lack of representation or support. Still, I think there needs to be more involvement by the Bronxville community.''</p>
        <p>The women's club has been the only local institution actively supporting artists. It will soon get company, however; the William S. Burt Gallery, which is scheduled to open in April or May of 2001 in the newly renovated Bronxville Library, will specialize in the art of Bronxville residents.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Abele and Mr. George spoke of the difficulty that artists have finding affordable work space in Westchester.</p>
        <p>''I often think of the vacant Smith-Cairns Ford building as a possible sight for artist studios, classrooms and a gallery,'' said Mr. Abele. ''And I am reminded of the beginning of SoHo -- how the artists would stake a claim in a community by rebuilding from the ground up.''</p>
        <p>Though Bronxville and vicinity is home to all the artists who will be exhibiting at the women's club, the work of the four has very different inspirations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prendergast finds his muse in his everyday life. Scraps of paper, ticket stubs and the like are an integral part of his art. ''My art is a documentation of my life,'' he said. ''I use whatever I can get my hands on. I use paint that I find, and I build layer upon layer of color and collage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Horne photographs local dancers. He was first inspired by modern dance when he saw performances at Sarah Lawrence College. Reminiscing, he explained: ''My mother took me to see classical ballet in Manhattan. Those early experiences made a tremendous impression on me. Today, I try to capture the essence of the dancers in my work. I think of the dancers' bodies as sculpture.''</p>
        <p>Mr. George sees his carving as a way of managing his emotions. ''It's a form of meditation,'' he said. ''When I carve, the day's tensions melt away. I put a lot of energy in my work. My aesthetic concern is for a balanced composition, however, my style is purposefully primitive. Like Mike, I find materials locally, such as felled trees. I simply strip away the bark and carve. The wood is still fairly wet, so, when I work with pine it tends to crack, which, to me, enhances the final image. ''</p>
        <p>Mr. George also has a notable connection to the past. In 1999, he did carvings for the Congo exhibit at the Bronx Zoo. A century earlier, A. P. Proctor and Charles Night, then residents of Lawrence Park, made limestone carvings for the Elephant House of the Bronx Zoo.</p>
        <p>Discussing his own work, Mr. Abele said: ''I'm compelled to paint landscapes. I see it as a way of defining myself. When I travel throughout the area, I seem to be looking for an answer -- to what, I don't know.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition at the Bronxville Women's Club, at 135 Midland Avenue, will begin with a reception for the artists next Sunday, from 2 to 5 p.m. The exhibition runs through Nov. 24. Information: (914)  337-3252.</p>
