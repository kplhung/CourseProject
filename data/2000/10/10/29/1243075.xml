        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Whatever happened to sportsmanship? It's one thing to be emotional and lose one's temper but quite another to have a player and his manager make excuses for it instead of apologizing. Roger Clemens should have been ejected from the game for his childish behavior, not lauded for his fine pitching afterwards. As for refusing to apologize, we have a saying in my home state of Texas: Were you raised in a barn, Roger?</p>
