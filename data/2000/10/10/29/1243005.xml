        <p>DAVID CONE had not just been hit hard; he had been hammered for four home runs, the last a three-run homer by the Orioles' ninth-place hitter, second baseman Mark Lewis. The Yankees lost that July 4 game, 7-6, and Cone's record was 1-7. As he left the mound in the sixth inning, boos thundered.</p>
        <p>''I deserved it and I don't blame them,'' he said later. ''I couldn't keep the ball in the ballpark.''</p>
        <p>Others wondered how long Joe Torre could keep David Cone in the rotation. Instead, the Yankee manager kept his faith in the 37-year-old right-hander who had once been the ace of the staff.</p>
        <p>''I'm not about to give up,'' Torre said that day, ''on David helping this team.''</p>
        <p>At the time, even the Yankee manager could not have envisioned that David Cone would get the single biggest out of a Subway Series that will always have an invisible asterisk for the broken-bat incident between Roger Clemens and Mike Piazza. But for pure baseball theater, Cone's inducing Piazza to pop up in Game 4 was the moment to cherish.</p>
        <p>All because Torre never did give up. Not even when Cone's pitching deteriorated even more. Not even when Cone dislocated his left shoulder diving for a ball. Not even when Cone finished with a 4-14 record and a 6.91 earned run average. But as Cone walked into the Yankee clubhouse in Baltimore after the last game of the season, he laughed.</p>
        <p>''I don't have a 6.91 E.R.A. anymore,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Cone knew that everybody's stats, whether a pitcher or a batter, start from scratch in the postseason. What he didn't know was whether he would even be on the postseason roster, but he soon learned that he was. In the division series against Oakland, he wasn't used. But in the American League Championship Series, he pitched the eighth inning in a 6-2 fifth-game loss in Seattle.</p>
        <p>''That one inning really helped,'' he said more than a week later, ''regardless if it was mop-up duty.''</p>
        <p>Cone had never been a mop-up pitcher. He had always been a big-game pitcher. His career record is 184-116 with a career 8-3 postseason record -- 2-1 in division series, 4-2 in the League Championship Series, 2-0 in the World Series. And for all of Cone's problems this year, when Torre thought about his Game 4 starter at Shea Stadium last Wednesday night, he considered both Cone and Denny Neagle.</p>
        <p>''If this helps you make up your mind,'' Cone told the manager, ''I'm fine coming out of the bullpen.''</p>
        <p>Cone meant that he had adjusted to warming up quickly. That helped to persuade Torre to start Neagle, but as the fifth inning evolved with the Yankees leading, 3-2, Torre knew that Piazza would be the Mets' third hitter. In the first inning Piazza had crushed a towering drive that was ruled foul, barely. In the third, Piazza had slammed a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>''Piazza,'' Torre said later, ''is one of the few players that's in scoring position when he's in the batter's box.''</p>
        <p>And with Piazza looming, Torre sent word to the bullpen coach, Tony Cloninger, for Cone to warm up, that he would be pitching to Piazza. ''I was told by Tony Cloninger to get ready for Piazza,'' Cone said later. ''I assumed that would be with a man on base.''</p>
        <p>But with two out and nobody on, Torre took the ball from Neagle and waved for Cone to come to the mound at Shea, where he once had pitched for the Mets. ''You got two outs,'' Torre told him, handing him the ball. ''We need one more.''</p>
        <p>One more to get out of the fifth inning with that 3-2 lead and go from there.</p>
        <p>''Mike traditionally takes a strike, usually,'' Cone recalled. ''I was a little careful with the first pitch, up and in. Then I threw a fastball away for a strike he took, then I threw two straight sliders. One he missed and one he fouled off.''</p>
        <p>In his catcher's squat, Jorge Posada signaled for a fastball, and Piazza swung.</p>
        <p>''We tied him up,'' Cone said. ''He popped it up.'' And second baseman Luis Sojo pulled in the high pop-up on the outfield grass.</p>
        <p>Had Torre not pinch-hit for Cone in the top of the sixth, maybe he would have pitched another inning, maybe not. It doesn't matter now. The Yankees held on to that one-run lead and won, 3-2. When they won Thursday night, 4-2, in what may have been the tautest five-game World Series ever played, Cone never appeared.</p>
        <p>''I'm in no position to ask for anything more,'' he had said after Game 4. ''I would love to get back out there again, but nonetheless, it's gratifying to be able to do anything at all at this point.''</p>
        <p>What Cone did in getting Mike Piazza to pop up was provide a happy ending to his career if he chooses to stop pitching rather than trying to squeeze another season out of that wonderful arm, probably with another team and another manager who would most likely not have the faith in him that Joe Torre did.</p>
        <p>He certainly doesn't need any more money; he has earned more than $60 million from baseball.</p>
        <p>He also doesn't need to prove he can still pitch. He proved that when Mike Piazza popped up.</p>
        <p>And when David Cone walked into the Yankees' clubhouse to celebrate their fourth World Series triumph in five years, he didn't even need to announce that his E.R.A. for this postseason was 0.00.</p>
