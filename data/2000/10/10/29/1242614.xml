        <p>An exhibition of more than 350 objects from the imperial court of the Qing Dynasty in China is on display at the Oakland Museum of California through Jan. 24.</p>
        <p>''Secret World of the Forbidden City: Splendors from China's Imperial Palace'' features portraits of the emperors and their courtiers, ceramics, ceremonial furniture,  embroidered robes and jewelry. Many of the objects have never before been exhibited.</p>
        <p>The Qings, also known as the Manchus, ruled from 1644 to 1911, and their earlier years -- especially the reign of Kangxi (1661 to 1722) -- were characterized by an expansion of the empire, patronage of the arts, interaction with Europeans and intellectual and scientific developments. The Qings' demise was also the finale of thousands of years of imperial rule in China.</p>
        <p>Among the artifacts are an imperial red-lacquer bathtub (19th century); a red sandalwood throne (18th century) with  symbols of the eight Buddhist treasures, such as longevity, power and happiness; and the English bicycle (circa 1909-12) of China's last emperor, Xuantong (Pu Yi).</p>
        <p>The Oakland Museum of California is at Oak and 10th Streets; information (888) 625-6873, or www.museumca.org. General admission, $13; closed Monday. The exhibition will travel to the Houston Museum of Natural Sciences March 3 through June 3.</p>
