        <p>For their next act, the Mets will stage a public duel, cap pistols at 10 paces, between Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday.

        <p>For their next act, the Mets will stage a public duel, cap pistols at 10 paces, between Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday. Theirs is the worst relationship in professional sports ownership, and Doubleday's recently expressed views about Shea Stadium are only the most recent manifestation of the severity of their split. It is only growing worse.</p>
        <p>Wilpon and Doubleday, each a 50 percent owner of the National League pennant winners, have long had a strained relationship, but it seems to deteriorate by the month or the week, if it is even possible that it can get worse. That it did not undermine the Mets' march toward the top of their league is remarkable. It is mind-boggling that Doubleday is doing everything he can to scuttle Wilpon's chances of seeing his dream ballpark built.</p>
        <p>A few days before the end of the season, Doubleday stood behind the batting cage before a game at Shea Stadium and told reporters that he was opposed to the idea of a new park and preferred that Shea be renovated. Just in case he missed some reporters, Doubleday found a larger forum: the World Series. Before Game 4, he stood in almost the same spot and repeated his position.</p>
        <p>Just as Doubleday has said in the past that he did not know anything about plans for a new park, he said that evening that he had not spoken with Wilpon about his idea. ''People think we don't talk,'' Doubleday said. ''That's not true at all. We do talk, but our paths haven't crossed.''</p>
        <p>Paths haven't crossed? They walked on the same field before games, and their paths didn't cross? There was no sign of a Berlin Wall at Shea separating the owners, but maybe they could not see each other because the field was so crowded with Major League Baseball sponsors, their families and friends, and the celebrities that baseball boasted about having at the games.</p>
        <p>Baseball people who attended World Series games at Shea were stunned to hear or read Doubleday's comments. Shea is considered one of the great dumps in the major leagues, and no one but Doubleday would favor renovation over the wrecking ball. Baseball is proud of its new parks and would like to add one in Queens. Some baseball people believe Doubleday expressed his views just to be contrary and to keep Wilpon from getting what he wants.</p>
        <p>''It is really a sign of how deep the split is,'' one executive said.</p>
        <p>Leiter's Psyche</p>
        <p>If any pitcher deserved a better postseason fate, it is Al Leiter. The Mets left-hander has staged some great performances and has little to show for them except the reputation he has gained as a big-game pitcher. From time to time after some of his brilliant efforts, Leiter has talked about the high level of concentration he was able to maintain in the particular game. So why can't he or other pitchers have that same concentration every time they pitch?</p>
        <p>''Because we're not robots,'' Leiter said. ''There are factors such as your mind wandering, the exterior distractions to get you away from what's important, what really matters, who's up, how you get him out, where can I throw it that I know he's not going to hit it hard. Your mind messes you up.</p>
        <p>''Then you factor in the boos and your self-esteem and confidence if you're not feeling good about yourself. There's a constant internal battle. When you're right, when you're locked in, when you feel good physically and mentally, you can do it.''</p>
        <p>Leiter said he tries to ''narrow the focus to what's important'' but has just not found it possible to achieve that in every start.</p>
        <p>''You give up a two-run bomb in the first inning,'' he said. ''Then the second inning you settle down and then the second batter hits a double, the next guy hits a little chinker and they have three. You still feel like you're a bad dude, but the scoreboard's telling you you're not and then you have to deal with that.''</p>
        <p>Aches and pain also can pierce a pitcher's psyche.</p>
        <p>''It alters you and doesn't allow you to be aggressive and confident and focus mentally on getting the hitter out because you're thinking about your hip, your butt, your shoulder,'' he said. ''Not every pitcher feels physically dominant every start.''</p>
        <p>Piniella Scouts the Field</p>
        <p>Lou Piniella, a free-agent manager, has received a strong three-year offer to remain with the Seattle Mariners, but he plans to find out what else is out there in the land of multiple managerial vacancies.</p>
        <p>The Mariners' offer of more than $2 million a year would place Piniella behind Joe Torre of the Yankees ($3 million) and Dusty Baker of San Francisco (a newly signed $2.75 million). It may take an even more lucrative offer to lure Piniella away from Seattle, where the Mariners have treated him very well.</p>
        <p>One spot that could intrigue Piniella is Boston, where Jimy Williams is employed as the Red Sox manager, but for how much longer? Talk is rampant in baseball circles that Williams will walk away from the job because General Manager Dan Duquette took Carl Everett's side in their dispute.</p>
        <p>Williams presumably would not leave unless he knew he could have one of the other openings. Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Arizona, Toronto and Los Angeles are still looking.</p>
        <p>Also making the rounds among baseball people: Ken Macha or Buck Martinez for the job with the Blue Jays and Bob Brenly for the Diamondbacks position. Macha is a coach with Oakland; Martinez and Brenly are television analysts.</p>
        <p>Crossing a Divide</p>
        <p>Jerry Reinsdorf, managing partner of the Chicago White Sox, is far and away the leader in the hiring of members of minorities for significant positions.</p>
        <p>Three years after he hired Jerry Manuel to manage the White Sox, he has made Ken Williams the club's general manager. The Williams promotion from vice president for player development came the same week the Pittsburgh Pirates made Lloyd McClendon the sixth manager who is a minority member.</p>
        <p>''The one encouraging thing for me, the one sign of progress, is most of the things I've read, that hasn't been the lead,'' Williams said, referring to racial identification. ''It's been an aside more than anything.''</p>
        <p>Williams, who this weekend has conducted his first organizational meetings with the White Sox, said he preferred that approach but added: ''As far as it being a symbol for anything, if anyone can see me in this position and gain motivation for themselves, then good, great. That would make me feel good and honored to be in a position where you could motivate someone to aspire to something.''</p>
        <p>Win 3; Don't Hit 3</p>
        <p>When the Yankees were one victory away from winning their third successive World Series, Reggie Jackson was asked if he felt protective about the Oakland streak (1972-74). ''No,'' he said, ''I just don't want anyone to hit three tonight.''</p>
        <p>His allusion was clear. He meant three home runs, the record-tying number he hit in Game 6 of the 1977 Series.</p>
        <p>Inside Pitches</p>
        <p>One baseball official, a former player, credited the Mets with reviving Paul O'Neill's slumbering bat in the World Series. O'Neill had batted only .231 in the first two rounds of the playoffs for the Yankees and had one hit in his first five at-bats in the World Series. He was a victim of a slow bat.</p>
        <p>But the Mets were throwing pitches away to O'Neill, where he could get to the ball, instead of pitching him inside, where he would have had difficulty catching up with the ball. The more pitches away he hit the more confident he became, the official said, instead of becoming frustrated with his inability to hit inside pitches. The result: 8 hits in his last 14 at-bats.</p>
        <p>The Mets, another official said, pitched David Justice inside, and he finished the World Series with 3 hits in 19 at-bats (.158).</p>
        <p>Who Did It? 'Not Me.'</p>
        <p>Was it Roger Clemens who threw Mike Piazza's broken bat in Game 2 of the World Series, or was he the victim of some conspiracy aimed at besmirching his solid reputation?</p>
        <p>The pitcher's agent, Alan Hendricks, blamed the news media for paying excessive attention to the incident. ''We want to let the players play the game,'' he said. ''Let them play the game. This should be the absolute neatest World Series, and the focus on this has taken on a life of its own.''</p>
        <p>But it was his client who threw the bat, wasn't it, and created the story in the first place?</p>
