        <p>Mystery Island</p>
        <p>Q.: My street map shows a speck of land called Mussel Island in the middle of Newtown Creek, roughly where it splits into Maspeth Creek and the English Kills, on the border between Brooklyn and Queens. I have looked for the island, but I can't seem to find it. Where did it go?</p>

        <p>Mystery Island</p>
        <p>Q.: My street map shows a speck of land called Mussel Island in the middle of Newtown Creek, roughly where it splits into Maspeth Creek and the English Kills, on the border between Brooklyn and Queens. I have looked for the island, but I can't seem to find it. Where did it go?</p>
        <p>A.: According to the current Hagstrom maps, Mussel Island should be right there behind the old Brooklyn Union Gas tanks in East Williamsburg. That stretch of Newtown Creek is for the most part inaccessible to the public, but several longtime employees of the company, known today as KeySpan Energy, said there was simply no island there, nor could anyone remember one. Local historians, including those who have explored the creek by boat, concur.</p>
        <p>In maps published from the late 1800's to the 1950's, Mussel Island appears as a small triangle, about half the size of a city block. It seems safe to assume that the island was named for the abundance of mussels that were once harvested thereabouts.</p>
        <p>Newtown Creek, roughly four miles long, was for many years a lazy rural thoroughfare, surrounded by farms and teeming with wildlife, but by the 1860's, coal and petroleum refineries had appeared. Chemical and fertilizer factories, as well as glue-making and bone-burning operations followed, and the banks were lined with wooden bulkheads. The creek, a dense commercial passage, required periodic dredging.</p>
        <p>It is hard to imagine that Mussel Island was anything more than an impediment to navigation by the early 1900's. In 1915, for example, more than 100,000 vessels passed through.</p>
        <p>Vincent Seyfried, a Queens historian, said it seemed likely that at some point the island was dredged out of the creek or, more likely, affixed to one of the banks with landfill. The contour of the western shore appears to be somewhat concave on maps before 1960. On current maps it appears to be straightened.</p>
        <p>None questioned had even the vaguest idea when the island disappeared. A researcher at the Hagstrom company said, ''We're taking it off for the next edition.''</p>
        <p>Herald Square's Bell</p>
        <p>Q.: Odd as it might sound, I used to enjoy being awakened every morning by the Bell Ringer's Clock in Herald Square. Why has it fallen silent?</p>
        <p>A.: Beneath the bell and the James Gordon Bennett Jr. memorial is a secondary clock that controls the ringing mechanism, which is synchronized with the display clock above. The motor of that clock, which was last serviced in the 1980's, burnt out in the spring, according to Robert Lawson, a spokesman for the Parks Department. It is being rebuilt in Connecticut and should be back in place soon, he said.</p>
        <p>The bell, along with the bronze statues of Minerva and the bell ringers, originally rested on the cornice of the New York Herald Building, a veritable Venetian palazzo on West 35th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Broadway. The building was demolished after The Herald merged with The New York Tribune in 1924.</p>
        <p>When functioning properly, the bell chimes on the hour from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>Odd Couple, East Side</p>
        <p>Q.: In the movie ''The Odd Couple,'' exterior shots put  the apartment shared by Oscar Madison and Felix Unger on Riverside Drive. In the TV series, they appear to live on Park Avenue. Did they move?</p>
        <p>A.: The cameras did. In the movie, Oscar and Felix live at 131 Riverside Drive, at 85th Street. In the opening scene of the series, the two emerge from the building at 1049 Park Avenue, near 87th Street, where Oscar throws his cigar butt on the sidewalk. Felix skewers it with the point of his umbrella. Mirth ensues.</p>
