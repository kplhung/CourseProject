        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks yesterday about Vice President Al Gore in Columbia, Mo.:</p>
        <p>''There have been some pretty interesting moments in the campaign, humorous moments. One of them took place during, I think, the third debate, if I'm not mistaken. It's when he looked in the cameras and told America, 'I'm against big government.' I could barely contain myself. I knew the man was prone to exaggeration, but not to that extent. Because he's a man who's looked at that surplus and wants to spend it all, and then some. He's a man who believes big government is the answer to this nation's problems. He's a person who wants to increase spending more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined. And folks, if you remember clearly, that's saying something. That goes a long way. And we have a difference of opinion. He believes in government, and as you're about to hear, we trust the people of America. This campaign supports the principle that government ought to be limited.</p>

        <p>There's a better day ahead. There's a better day ahead when we have a president who not only sets a legislative agenda, but a president who sets great goals for this great land. The goal that no one should be left behind as we head into the 21st century. The goal that every child be educated. The goal that our citizenry should retire in dignity, that the health care system be the best it can be, the goal that the world will be peaceful, a goal that the government stand on the side of the people with a helping hand, not a heavy hand.''</p>
