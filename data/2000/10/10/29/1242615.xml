        <p>We may be living in modern times, but most people's idea of luxurious living is stuck in another century: when we think of a grand New York apartment, visions of robber-baron-style rooms, with red damask curtains and old master paintings, dance in our heads.</p>
        <p>Well, not everyone's head. The owners of this Manhattan apartment hired the designer Vicente Wolf to take a typical Park Avenue apartment and turn it into something that was not a typical Park Avenue apartment. ''They wanted something that had the sense of a glass of Champagne,'' Wolf explains.</p>

        <p>We may be living in modern times, but most people's idea of luxurious living is stuck in another century: when we think of a grand New York apartment, visions of robber-baron-style rooms, with red damask curtains and old master paintings, dance in our heads.</p>
        <p>Well, not everyone's head. The owners of this Manhattan apartment hired the designer Vicente Wolf to take a typical Park Avenue apartment and turn it into something that was not a typical Park Avenue apartment. ''They wanted something that had the sense of a glass of Champagne,'' Wolf explains.</p>
        <p>In one way, his job was easy: Wolf's clients collect large-scale contemporary art, hardly the stuff of stuffy rooms. But he resisted the impulse to design around the art; the last thing he wanted was something that looked more like a gallery than someone's home. ''Those pieces aren't created in an austere environment,'' Wolf argues; hanging them in one ''dehumanizes the art.''</p>
        <p>So Wolf infused these rooms with a humanism -- albeit one of a decidedly posh variety -- by carefully blending the old with the new. He transformed the apartment's architecture from what he called ''sweetly traditional'' to ''30's or 40's glam'' by replacing the old moldings with something a bit more severe, laying down a dark mahogany floor to contrast with the pale walls and enlarging the doorway into the living room to exaggerate the room's scale. (He also made the dining room a bit smaller to make space for a guest room, since the apartment's second bedroom was turned into a library.)</p>
        <p>In decorating the apartment, Wolf gave his clients the fizz they wanted by skillfully weaving antique and contemporary at every turn. In the living room, that meant surrounding a 1950's marble-topped table by Eero Saarinen with three 19th-century Italian side chairs and hanging a Venetian chandelier above it. The windows along one side of the living room are covered only with shades for a clean, modern feeling, while the windows at either end of the 33-foot-long room are hung with voluminous silk curtains.</p>
        <p>Similar curtains are hung all the way around the dining room, where they become undulating walls that serve as a backdrop for two big, colorful paintings by Eric Fischl and Ross Bleckner. Classic straight-backed upholstered chairs alternate with tapestry-covered 1940's chairs by the French designer Jules Leleu around an inlaid-wood table of Wolf's design. In the master bedroom, a sleek wooden storage cube, also designed by Wolf, is tucked under a rather ornate 18th-century table.</p>
        <p>This interplay continues all over the apartment. ''Wherever there is something traditional, it's juxtaposed with something modern,'' Wolf says. ''The openness of the space, the lack of pattern and the pale blue-green color scheme are all very contemporary, so you know it's modern, but somehow it has a sense of the past.''</p>
        <p>Part of that sense comes from the sheer luxury of the materials Wolf uses here, like silk, velvet and even buckskin -- to cover a chair (in a nod to the French designer Jean-Michel Frank, a master at giving tradition a modern twist). ''Sixty percent of the things we do are sensory,'' Wolf explains. ''You feel the quality of the paint job or the upholstery. That's what true luxury is to me.''</p>
        <p>But the lightness of these ample spaces and the wit with which Wolf balances past and present make these rooms fresh and young, which is just what his clients wanted. ''In rooms like this, you're walking a fine line,'' the designer says. ''If you go too much one way or the other it can become predictable. And my clients are not predictable people.''</p>
