      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>At midnight the town of Princeton is almost completely dead -- except at a sandwich shop a few blocks from the center, where the lights are on and the line is long. With foot-and-a-half hoagies, old photographs of university students that double as decor and a griddle that never stops sputtering, Hoagie Haven is indeed a late-night haven. It is a noontime haven too, judging from the business suits alongside the backpacks at the counter, where hoagies are the order of the day, every day. Words like ''with everything'' and ''whole'' are common here; it is one of the few places left where a $3 sandwich can contain the calories equivalent to a five-course meal. Cheese steaks, Italian hoagies (both $2.45 half, $4 whole) and the chicken and eggplant Parmigianias ($2.65 half, 4.50 whole) are favorites, the owners say. Also popular are omelet hoagies, which come in cheese, bacon, sausage or Western varieties. A faded sign vouches that they ''serve the best hamburgers on Earth or anyplace else.'' Owned by a pair of distantly related Greek immigrants, George Angeletopoulos and Gus Lyras, the Haven, as it is known to students, has been a staple of Nassau Street for 30 years. The two men have owned the shop for the past 13 or 14 years, by Mr. Lyras's calculation, and serve sandwiches with a staff of six, including his wife, Georgia, who helps with the lunch rush. For a smallish storefront with no seating, the shop does a serious business, each day slicing open 300 to 500 loaves of bread (bought fresh from the Italian Peoples' Bakery in Trenton each morning). Although the Haven will make hoagies to order, the menu hasn't changed in years and according to Mr. Lyras, isn't going to anytime soon. The customers, in business suits or with backpacks, aren't complaining, according to Mr. Lyras. ''They want the same thing all the time.''</p>
        <p>Hoagie Haven, 242 Nassau Street, Princeton; (609) 921-7723. Open 9 to 1 a.m. daily.</p>
