        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert Muschamp's reflections on the Zeitgeist of the new design [''A Happy, Scary New Day for Design,'' Oct. 15], exemplified by the works of Bruce Mau, was the most far-reaching essay on postmodern culture that I've read since Marshall McLuhan's over 30 years ago, which Mr. Muschamp also cites. His elaboration of the functions and types of veils -- structural, literary, economic and psychological -- inherent in the new design was remarkably deft.</p>
        <p>As a psychotherapist, however, I'd like to make explicit an emotional dimension he left implicit. Mr. Muschamp wrote: ''The mind is dense with veils that float between what we see, what we know, what we believe and how, or whether, we choose to act.'' I would add that veils also function as defense mechanisms (see Anna Freud), affecting what emotions we feel, are willing to feel or don't want to feel. Mr. Muschamp's insight about critical thinking -- ''a constant oscillation between conviction and doubt'' -- needs to incorporate the psychological condition of being able to tolerate the anxiety that accompanies such uncertainty. As he says at the outset, ''It is scary to be living at a time'' like this.</p>
