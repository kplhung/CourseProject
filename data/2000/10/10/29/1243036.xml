        <p>On black radio stations and in newspapers, from pulpits to mailboxes to answering machines, Democrats and civil rights organizations have begun an effort of unprecedented size to increase the turnout of black voters in next month's presidential election. In several close states, Vice President Al Gore's chances may hinge on the effort's effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Advertisements proclaiming ''Lift every voice and vote!'' have been placed on the screens of Magic Johnson Theaters before movies, and on Black Entertainment Television. Students at black colleges are being urged by entertainers to vote, and congregants at thousands of black churches will hear the same message on the Sunday before Nov. 7. Organizers for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People have even registered more than 11,000 prisoners at county jails around the South.</p>
        <p>One of the most promising tactics gets under way this week, when telephones in black neighborhoods will begin ringing with a recorded message from President Clinton, urging a vote for Mr. Gore. Similar calls by the president in 1998 on behalf of Democratic candidates in Georgia were considered an important reason black voters represented 29 percent of the total turnout, up from 19 percent in 1994.</p>
        <p>''We got a lot of comments on those calls in 1998, and now everyone's doing it,'' said David Worley, chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party. ''People especially love it when their answering machine picks up his call, and then they can play it for their friends.''</p>
        <p>The voter drive comes at a moment when both sides in the narrowly divided presidential race are frantically skipping from one contested state to another, many of which -- Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois and Florida, for example -- have large black populations that could decide the outcome. Although the turnout of black voters has usually lagged behind their percentage of the population, efforts in several states have shown that the turnout can be greatly stimulated by a combination of effective candidates and marketing.</p>
        <p>Because the race is so close, turnout could be decisive. In Missouri, for example, where polls show the race to be dead even, the voting-age population is 10 percent black, but blacks generally constitute only 5 to 8 percent of the electoral turnout. If the turnout drive can boost black participation to 10 percent or more while the white vote remains steady, those extra two or three points could be enough to swing the state.</p>
        <p>In the battleground state of Michigan, a concerted effort in 1998 resulted in black voters making up 19 percent of the total turnout, even though they represent only 13 percent of the state's voting population.</p>
        <p>The drive has both a partisan wing, run by the Gore campaign and the Democratic Party, and an ostensibly nonpartisan wing, run by the N.A.A.C.P. in conjunction with several other civil rights organizations. But both are clearly drawing on the tradition that about 90 percent of black voters usually support Democrats, and they hope to transfer Mr. Clinton's enormous support among African-Americans to Mr. Gore. With enough money and enthusiasm, experts say they may break some records this year.</p>
        <p>David Bositis, an expert on black voting with the nonpartisan Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, says this year's effort is by far the largest and most expensive ever made to generate black turnout, with at least 10 times as much money being spent as in 1996. If it succeeds, Mr. Bositis said, the percentage of this year's vote cast by blacks may for the first time equal that of blacks in the nation's voting-age population, which is 12 percent.</p>
        <p>''In 1992, blacks were 8 percent of voters, and in 1996 and '98 they were 10 percent,'' he said. ''If this effort succeeds and the vote gets up to 12 percent, blacks will be decisive in the outcome of the election.''</p>
        <p>To help reach that goal, the N.A.A.C.P. is spending $9 million -- from a handful of large donations -- on an enormous effort, known as Operation Big Vote, to boost black turnout in a dozen swing states, buying advertising and conducting bus tours with prominent political and entertainment figures urging people to vote. The tours are for the most part hitting the states the Gore campaign needs to win. Rural areas are not being neglected either; the nonpartisan Black Leadership Forum is distributing handbills in hundreds of barbershops and salons in small black communities.</p>
        <p>But the campaign by the N.A.A.C.P. and related groups, which is not supposed to be partisan, has at times veered toward such strong criticism of the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, that it has drawn fire for its tone.</p>
        <p>One television commercial features Renee Mullins, the daughter of James Byrd, the man who was dragged to death in Jasper, Tex., in 1998. In the commercial, Ms. Mullins says that when Mr. Bush refused to support a hate crimes law after her father was killed, ''it was like my father was killed all over again.''</p>
        <p>(Texas does have a hate crimes law, but Mr. Bush did not support a bill increasing the penalties for crimes based on race or sexual orientation.)</p>
        <p>Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, a black Republican, said the advertisement was out of bounds in suggesting an equivalency between Mr. Bush and Mr. Byrd's killers, and predicted it would backfire.</p>
        <p>Another advertisement, which the organization placed in The Atlanta Daily World and other black newspapers, urges voters to call Mr. Bush to complain that he has not sufficiently supported the prohibition of racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Andrea Pringle, communications director of the N.A.A.C.P. National Voter Fund, which was established in July, said the advertisements were not intended to promote Mr. Gore.  ''The intent is to raise the issue of hate crimes legislation, which is an important subject,'' she said. ''In examining any issue, people want to know where the candidates stand on issues, the same reason you have debates and such. This is an important time, an important election cycle where you have an opportunity to elect both a pro-civil rights president and a pro-civil rights Congress, which is very important to the N.A.A.C.P.''</p>
        <p>But many Republicans say the group's drive is the equivalent of soft-money advertising for Mr. Gore and the Democrats. The Republican National Committee is also beginning an unusual advertising campaign on black radio stations, urging listeners to consider the party's position on education and taxes, but the attempt is not considered likely to change the overwhelming preference of African-Americans for Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>The larger efforts by the Democrats and the N.A.A.C.P. are based on previous attempts to increase black turnout in carefully selected states, in some cases the same ones that have become battlegrounds in this year's contest. In Michigan, for example, black turnout increased from 9 percent of the total in 1992 to 13 percent in 1996 to 19 percent in 1998, according to a study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. In Illinois, it rose from 14 percent in 1992 to 17 percent in 1996.</p>
        <p>One of the largest increases occurred in Georgia, now a model for much of this year's national efforts. Georgia's turnout was 19 percent black in 1994, with that figure rising to 25 percent in 1996 and 29 percent in the midterm elections of 1998, an overall increase of more than 50 percent. Many blacks turned out to support Gov. Roy E. Barnes and two black candidates on the statewide ballot, and to vote against an unpopular candidate for lieutenant governor who had been making overtly race-based appeals to whites.</p>
        <p>But the Democrats also used several effective marketing techniques: mailing tailored literature to black registered voters, placing ads on black radio stations and placing recorded telephone calls by Mr. Clinton and prominent black leaders to black households, urging them to vote. This technique is easier in the nine Southern states (and parts of seven others) covered by the federal Voting Rights Act, where registered voters must record their race, but it can also be used elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''The idea was to get 50 hits per black registered voter,'' said Mr. Bositis of the Joint Center. ''In other words, 50 times where a black voter would get a phone call or a letter, or encounter an ad on a radio station or in a black newspaper. They met their goals in Georgia, and it worked.''</p>
        <p>Georgia, where Mr. Bush has consistently been several points ahead in the polls, is not considered a battleground this year, and neither candidate is running television ads here. But the techniques used here and in other states in 1998 are being used in this election's most contested states. Late last week, Mr. Clinton began recording telephone messages that make points on behalf of Mr. Gore similar to the points he had made on behalf of Democrats candidate two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was also scheduled to conduct a telephone conference call with several hundred black pastors today, in which he will suggest points they can make in their Sunday sermons leading up to the election.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is convinced the methods will be as effective as they were in 1998, however. Georgia State Representative Bob Holmes, who is also director of the Southern Center for Studies in Public Policy at Clark Atlanta University, said sophisticated marketing was often not as important as the nature of the candidates.</p>
        <p>''The thing that really energizes black voters is the presence of a candidate who is seen as adversely affecting their interest,'' said Mr. Holmes, a Democrat who teaches political science at the historically black college. ''This year, we don't seem to have the same sort of demon or enemy on the ballot. Bush comes across superficially as a good guy, so many people aren't bothering to look closely at his record.''</p>
