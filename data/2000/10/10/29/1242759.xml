        <p>So the Sachem Quality of Life Organization is surprised that so many Long Islanders view them as anti-immigrant extremists [''Border Warriors,'' Oct. 22]? What do they expect when one of their spokesmen said in published reports that the Army should be sent to Farmingville? When asked what the Army would do there, he responded that they would tell the immigrants to move on, if not, they would be shot. This same spokesman, Ray Wysolmierski, has publicly called Americans who have spoken up against the harassment of Latinos in Farmingville ''traitors'' and suggested that justice for such individuals would include hanging.</p>
        <p>Two days after the beating of Mexican day laborers by avowed white supremacists, I attended a peaceful vigil in Farmingville calling for the prompt arrest of those involved. Sachem counter-demonstrators harassed those at the vigil, cursing at us, telling Latinos to ''go back to where they came from'' and in one case spitting on a Salvadoran-born U.S. citizen who had the effrontery to stand quietly for justice in Farmingville. Sachem's leader, Margaret Bianculli-Dyber, had to be repeatedly restrained by the police as she screamed at those at the vigil that ''America is not a country of immigrants,'' and that we were liars when we said that it was. Her hot-headed behavior could have caused a riot and it is a tribute to the Latinos she tried to intimidate that it did not.</p>

        <p>Sachem is not an ordinary community organization concerned about taxes, safety and community standards. It is a hate group that attacks immigrants, Catholics (whom its supporters call ''papists'') and anyone who appeals to reason and compromise. In its public presentations, it has peddled conspiracy theories about immigration involving a web stretching from the Vatican to the Ford Foundation, and has hinted darkly that immigrants in Farmingville are the leading edge of an invasion force designed to restore the American Southwest to Mexico! Long Islanders are rightly concerned that such an organization not pretend to speak for them.</p>
