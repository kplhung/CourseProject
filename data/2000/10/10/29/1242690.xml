        <p>IT is a street parallel to the playing fields at Trinity College, a corner of the now handsome block that is home to the neighborhood's four newest schools, where Eddie Perez illustrates the progress of an ambitious plan to reinvent a poor neighborhood in the poorest city in the state.</p>

        <p>IT is a street parallel to the playing fields at Trinity College, a corner of the now handsome block that is home to the neighborhood's four newest schools, where Eddie Perez illustrates the progress of an ambitious plan to reinvent a poor neighborhood in the poorest city in the state.</p>
        <p>''Four years ago, there was a gang assassination at 2:30 in the afternoon, during a football game,'' said Mr. Perez, the president of the Southside Institutions Neighborhood Alliance, as he points across the block from the new $110 million school buildings. ''Today there are kids in there going to school and it's a corner of hope.''</p>
        <p>There is also a job training center, a Boys and Girls Club and a social service agency, all created in the last three years as Trinity attempts to raise the neighborhood where the college sits. The area, called Barry Square, was once known for its drugs, prostitution and robberies. Now it has become a symbol of renewal and to what one college can do for its community.</p>
        <p>''The seeds were there before Evan came,'' Mr. Perez said, referring to Evan S. Dobelle who was named president of the college in 1995. ''But everyone was thinking small. There was no way we thought of building schools. Evan thought big.''</p>
        <p>The newly hired Mr. Dobelle was able to persuade the trustees of the college and ultimately, (with the help of several politicians, including Kevin Sullivan, the State Senate president pro-tem and an employee of Trinity), the state legislature to back a $175 million plan to improve a 15-block area that included the Barry Square and Frog Hollow neighborhoods with new schools, housing, jobs, recreation and social services.</p>
        <p>In addition, he called on his neighbors who were partners in the neighborhood alliance: Hartford Hospital, the Institute of Living, Connecticut Children's Medical Center and Connecticut Public Television and Radio. The city's corporations were also tapped for support. Aetna and the Loctite Corporation gave the first $2 million. The Kellogg Corporation gave a $5.1 million grant to Trinity to support its plans. Hartford Steam Boiler, Fleet, People's and Bank of Boston also contributed.</p>
        <p>''If you're a firefighter or a teacher, you can live here and not have to worry about not being able to afford a private school,'' said Mr. Dobelle, who is 55 and brought a unique background of politics (mayor of Pittsfield, Mass. and chief of protocol in the Carter administration) and education ( he was president of two community colleges).</p>
        <p>Those involved in the project attribute its success to pairing two seemingly disparate groups: the power brokers and the people movers. It was the legislature and the corporations that found the money to buy real estate but in at least one case it was knowing the father of one homeowner because he played dominoes with Eddie Perez's uncle that clinched the sale. The Hartford Areas Rally Together Job Center is funded by a pastiche of programs, but it functions because its director, Ana Natal, knows somebody who knows somebody who will hire a woman who has never filled out a resume, but has children to support.</p>
        <p>This blend pleases Mr. Dobelle, but he would like to see the plan replicated elsewhere. In a recent interview in his office, he said that a colleague from Williams College just phoned and told him the neighborhood plan was the talk of a recent conference.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Great! Is anyone else doing it?' '' The answer was, just one other college, the University of Southern California.</p>
        <p>''We wanted the whole community to buy into the idea that their kids can be anything they want,'' he said. The plan meshed with the college's promotion of community service; some 1,400 of the 1,800 students at the college volunteer, Mr. Dobelle said. Since Mr. Dobelle's arrival on campus, applications to Trinity have increased 77 percent, according to his staff.</p>
        <p>The most expensive and ambitious portion of the plan is complete: four public schools arranged around a central green on 16 acres between Broad and Washington streets, next door to the Trinity campus. They are known collectively as ''The Learning Corridor.'' Construction began in 1998 on the $110-milion buildings and the schools opened last month to 800 students. These include: a Montessori school for pre-kindergarten through fifth grade; a city magnet middle school for grades six through eight; a math and science academy, and an arts academy.</p>
        <p>The 516,000 square feet of buildings will ultimately serve 1,500 students. The complex also includes a 632-seat community theater. On the first floor beneath the parking garage, retail spaces are for rent. The project partners hope these spaces will house small, community-based businesses. The project was funded by $94 million of state money with neighborhood alliance partners and the city contributing $10.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively.</p>
        <p>The Montessori Magnet School is the only public Montessori school in Connecticut and one of just 15 public ones in the nation. The 230 students are grouped by ages rather than grade. Emphasis is placed on experiential learning, including practical life skills and a music program that starts 95 percent of the students in violin at age 5. The school will ultimately serve up to 350 children. It is state-funded and operated by the Connecticut Region Education Council, as are the two high schools.</p>
        <p>Each classroom on the first floor of the Montessori school opens to the courtyard, a whimsical space that includes a stream where children can control water flow and gardens.</p>
        <p>About half of the children at the school come from Hartford, with 25 percent of those from the neighborhood. The rest hail from 20 participating school districts. A lottery system was used; there were more than 200 applications for the 48 places in the 3- to 5-year-old classes and phone calls keep coming, said Timothy Nee, the principal.</p>
        <p>Tonya Dorman, a third-year law student at the University of Connecticut who lives in Windsor and works as a law clerk in Hartford, enrolled her son, Rochayne, 3, because she liked the school's intellectual orientation for pre-schoolers.</p>
        <p>''I'm West Indian and it is the closest I could get to the education I received as a child in Jamaica, where I learned to read at 2,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Just across the green is the Hartford Middle Magnet School where doors opened in September to a class of 200 sixth graders, all but 10 from the neighborhood school district. Over the next two years, 400 more seventh and eighth graders will be added. It was built with $27 million of city and state money and $1 million from the neighborhood alliance.</p>
        <p>The school emphasizes science, math and the arts. Its principal, James Longo, said the ultimate goal is for the school to be an inter-district magnet. Parents' night, Mr. Longo said, was a full house. The school's library will be stocked in the coming weeks and its swimming pool open.</p>
        <p>The middle school is steps away from the Greater Hartford Academy of Mathematics and Science. Built to serve 300 high school students from around the state, it was funded by $46 million of state bonds and donations.</p>
        <p>As of September, 148 students from 13 public school districts enrolled in either morning or afternoon math and science classes taught by teachers and researchers and faculty mentors from Trinity College, the University of Connecticut Health Center and the University of Hartford. Among the offerings are courses in robotics and molecular genetics. There is a cell culture laboratory and a computer controlled green house. Jeffrey Osborne, the school director, said ''there are no quotas'' at the academy. Thirty-two percent of the students are from Hartford. There are more girls than boys, more minorities than whites.</p>
        <p>At the Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts next door, students audition or submit portfolios for admission.</p>
        <p>Until September, the arts academy was housed for about 12 years in a former funeral home and bar on Wethersfield Avenue in Hartford. Kim Stroud, the school's managing director, said student dancers were reluctant to leap with abandon since the ceilings were so low. The new performance spaces are very different, with many windows and soaring ceilings. Musicians work in modern recording studios. Writers listen to visiting poets while perched on upholstered furniture in a room that overlooks the green. More important, school administrators said, the majority of the teachers are themselves performing artists.</p>
        <p>These 260 students leave their home schools in 43 different school districts to attend either morning or afternoon classes at the arts academy. About 21 percent of the students are from Hartford. Students must audition and apply to be considered for the program. Unlike the math and science academy, this school will accept students whose home districts do not participate in the magnet program. Students can pay privately. Sebastien Guidetti, 17, of Glastonbury works summers on a blueberry farm to help earn some of the $3,900 tuition so he can play the vibraphone, percussion and piano in the academy's jazz ensemble.</p>
        <p>The school building project is complete and the program to build owner-occupied housing is one-third accomplished. Thus far, 15 houses have either been newly built or rehabilitated; four more are under construction and 10 more properties will be completed, said Mr. Perez, who coordinates the housing effort. Many vacant houses have been torn down. The restored or new homes have been sold to neighborhood residents. Seventy percent of people in the target area are Hispanic. Eighty-five percent of them are renters.</p>
        <p>On average, the two family homes are built for $185,000 with city, state and federal subsidies. The neighborhood alliance sells the houses for about $95,000, often with down payment assistance and reduced mortgage rates. The conditions for the buyers are these: They must live in the house for at least three years, 10 percent of the debt is discounted if they stay 10 years or more. They need to take a home ownership training class. People who live or work in the area get top priority, a practice Mr. Dobelle calls ''geographic affirmative action.''</p>
        <p>Mark Hallums is negotiating to buy a big yellow house around the corner from the Learning Corridor. The 34-year-old Bloomfield resident works in the buildings and grounds department at Trinity. He said the offer of home ownership was too good to pass up.</p>
        <p>''If this collaboration can put up $200 million in the area,'' he said, hooking his thumb in the direction of Mr. Perez as a symbol of the neighborhood alliance, ''I can put up $100,000.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobelle wasn't the first person to suggest change for the Barry Square and Frog Hollow neighborhoods. His predecessor, Tom Gerety, supported neighborhood groups. The neighborhood alliance is 22-years-old, but was not yet part of a coalition. There was a community newspaper, merchant associations and educational programs. They needed to be galvanized.</p>
        <p>The first big thing Mr. Dobelle did was come up with $5.9 million. Hartford Hospital put up another $5 million, legitimizing the project. Experts were hired to examine the 15-block area of the neighborhood. At the same time, Mr. Dobelle and Mr. Perez went into the neighborhood to hear concerns and capitalize on existing community groups such as Hartford Areas Rally Together (HART).</p>
        <p>''Kids were their top priority,'' Mr. Perez said. ''Then crime, jobs and housing. People said maybe if we had decent jobs, crime wouldn't be such a big problem.''</p>
        <p>The police department is focusing on ''quality of life'' issues in the neighborhood, such as public drinking, noise complaints, an approach used successfully in cities like New York. Statistically, major crime in the Barry Square neighborhood has decreased 33 percent since 1993, according to Hartford Police Sergeant Neil Dryfe, the department's public information officer. Yet he noted there has been an increase of 29 percent from January to August of this year when compared to the same period in 1999.</p>
        <p>Across the street from Hartford Hospital is the HART Job Center. It opened in 1996 to train and find work primarily for residents of the neighborhood. Several hundred people are placed each year. The center was the first source for hiring during construction of the Learning Corridor.</p>
        <p>The center's director, Ana Natal, and her staff steer people to available jobs, help them learn to type, use a computer and fill out an application. Mr. Perez admitted the center is sometimes more unorthodox than professional, but said that does not hamper its effectiveness. Ms. Natal said the center is a start for people.</p>
        <p>''A lot of our people walk in off the street, most of them are Hispanic and don't speak English,'' she said. ''They have nothing and nowhere else to go. We don't turn people away.''</p>
        <p>New houses and buildings are up, some streets have been improved, but a lot of work remains. On some streets surrounding the school, house after house is abandoned, their yards littered with broken glass.</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael Peters did not return telephone calls seeking comment about the Trinity program. Yet when asked about the neighborhood, the first thing residents point out is the Learning Corridor as the most potent symbol of change. Others use different markers. Yolanda Jimenez and her husband own the Roque Market. It is a small, neat-as-a-pin grocery store on Zion Street where the owners estimate half of the customers are on welfare. She expressed guarded optimism when asked about the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''We opened in early January and since then the neighborhood seems more calm than it was,'' she said. ''There were a lot of drugs but I think it's improved.''</p>
        <p>Last February, the Connecticut Historical Society announced plans to move from its west end location to Zion Street, in the neighborhood known as Behind The Rocks, which borders Trinity. The architect, Frank Gehry, will design the 115,000-square-foot space. Linda Campanella, Trinity senior vice president for operations and planning, said the society's decision was another example of ''a nonprofit catalyzing economic renewal in the area.'' As the neighborhood is restored, Mr. Dobelle said he hopes self-confidence of its residents follows.</p>
        <p>'' Nonprofit organizations don't pay taxes for a reason, Mr. Dobelle said, adding that these institutions are supposed to give back to their communities. ''We're trying to do the right thing. We're sending a signal to other colleges that asks, do you or don't you do the right thing?''</p>
