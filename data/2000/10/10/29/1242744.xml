        <p>To the Editor: Alice Furlaud's recollections of festive departures by boat from New York to Europe, ''Bon Voyage Doesn't Mean What It Used To'' (Oct. 1), recall the the thrill of yet another celebrated sailing, of the gleaming white liner Lurline from San Francisco to Honolulu.</p>
        <p>Taking a year off between college and graduate school, I had hastened south from Oregon to San Francisco and got a typing job. As the time for my departure for Northwestern University drew near, I was determined to see the Lurline off at least once. Claiming a dental emergency, I took a long lunch break, hurried to the pier and wandered from deck to deck. Noticing a party in one stateroom, I joined it, sipping wine and nibbling hors d'oeuvre while chatting with the guests. Then, wishing our hostess bon voyage with a hearty kiss, I dashed back to work, fortunate in having experienced a ritual of a more leisurely world of travel that has now, alas, vanished.</p>
