        <p>Slimming soaps that slough off fat in the shower. Miracle pills that get rid of excess pounds without dieting or exercise. Plastic earplugs that curb the appetite. Even a glittering ring called Fat-Be-Gone that when slipped on a finger trims hips, buttocks and thighs. After her second baby was born, April Mankowsky got to know all the latest weight loss gimmicks -- and tried her fair share of them, too.</p>
        <p>''I'm a fool,'' said Mrs. Mankowsky, of Blue Ridge, Tex., who recently bought a month's supply of  Aoqili Defat Seaweed Soap on the Internet. ''I knew it wasn't going to work. But I'm desperate, and the ad said, 'Watch the fat go down the drain.' ''</p>
        <p>Since fenfluramine, part of the popular prescription drug combination known as fen-phen, was pulled from pharmacy shelves in 1997 for causing dangerous and potentially fatal side effects, dieters have scrambled for a substitute that offers the same dramatic results with as little effort. In their search, they have turned quick-fix, over-the-counter weight loss products from a tiny sliver of the diet industry into its fastest-growing segment.</p>
        <p>But the surging demand for a weight loss ''silver bullet'' has fueled a rapid rise in fraudulent advertising, industry groups and regulators say. With increasing bravado, diet companies are flouting federal guidelines to promise the easy solutions consumers have come to expect, even though their products may have no effect on weight loss or may even be harmful.</p>
        <p>In fact, no sooner had fenfluramine been yanked from the market than the indicators of deceptive weight loss marketing began to climb. Consumer complaints about misleading diet advertisements have more than tripled at the Federal Trade Commission, to 607 last year from 161 in 1997. And, after pursuing only four cases in the first half of the 1990's, the Better Business Bureau has investigated 24 diet companies in the last five years.</p>
        <p>''We're in the Wild West of advertising right now,'' said Andrea Levine, director of the bureau's national advertising division. ''We're seeing claims being made on a whim without a scintilla of evidence, and there's such a huge proliferation of products it's very hard for the regulatory world to get hold of it.''</p>
        <p>Over all, the $34 billion market for diet products and services has shrunk slightly in the last four years, shaken by fundamental changes in the way Americans try to lose weight.</p>
        <p>Sales of low-calorie foods and snacks have dropped 40 percent since 1996, according to Marketdata Enterprises, a Tampa, Fla., research firm. Sales of diet soft drinks have withered to pre-1990 levels. Weight Watchers has been successful, but revenue for commercial weight loss centers as a group has declined by nearly $1 billion in the last decade, pushing Jenny Craig to the verge of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. And though Slim-Fast still sells well, the market for diet shakes and other meal replacements has fallen by half in the last 10 years, reflecting a growing frustration with diets criticized for being slow to work and hard to maintain.</p>
        <p>Yet nonprescription pills, dietary supplements and other over-the-counter weight loss agents have never been more popular. After years of little change, sales of diet pills and supplements have more than quadrupled since 1996 -- to $782 million this year from $168 million -- invigorated by the broad retreat from conventional weight loss regimens that require sweat and sacrifice.</p>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to ban over-the-counter access to phenylpropanolamine, a common ingredient in appetite suppressants like Acutrim and Dexatrim that may increase the risk of stroke in young women. But even if it does, the sale of nonprescription diet pills is not likely to slow. Most of the growth in that market is being driven by dietary supplements whose active ingredients include herbs like ephedra and chitosan, a fiber-like substance derived from shellfish.</p>
        <p>Diet industry groups and federal officials say the growing appetite for quick-fix weight loss products gives rogue companies ever more incentive to stoke their claims. Each time a manufacturer succeeds with exaggerated promises, regulators say, several more follow suit, plastering the airwaves and the Internet with invitations to drop weight while driving, lose 10 pounds in a weekend and, of course, never diet again.</p>
        <p>Take the Fat-Be-Gone ring, sold on the Web by American Design, a St. Louis jewelry maker, and in retail chains like Walgreens. By tapping into the ''principles of acupuncture and acupressure,'' the company's online advertisement said, the coil-like trinket can have the same effect as ''jogging up to six miles a day.'' The ad promised that when worn on the little finger, the ring slims the thighs. The ring finger is for the stomach, thumb for the face and so on -- all with ''no drugs, no starving, no sweating.'' After repeated interview requests by The New York Times, the company removed the Web site on which the claims were made and declined to comment.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's unreasonable that we want to have a miracle,'' said Lynn McAfee, director of the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination, an advocacy group for overweight people. ''That's what we're sold every day.'' She added that she has a Fat-Be-Gone ring and that at least four of her friends had bought them as well. ''In the back of my mind, I say, Well, maybe it will work.''</p>
        <p>Beyond Fraud, A Health Impact</p>
        <p>The rise in questionable advertising worries federal and state regulators because diet fraud, though primarily an economic crime, can have a significant impact on public health. More than half of all Americans are overweight, and 22 percent are heavy enough to qualify as obese, according to the National Institutes of Health. As diet gimmicks lure consumers away from serious weight loss efforts, regulators fear, the incidence of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and other illnesses associated with obesity will increase.</p>
        <p>''The difference between self-diagnosis and professional treatment is quickly becoming a blurred distinction,'' said Robert Reyna, who coordinates a state attorneys general working group on health fraud. ''Someone might be taking these products in lieu of getting real medical treatment.''</p>
        <p>Industry groups say deceptive marketing is ultimately counterproductive as well, since duped consumers will shy away from other diet products sold on the Internet and cable TV, where weight loss advertising has flourished in recent years.</p>
        <p>''There are scoundrels and charlatans who are abusing the medium and giving the industry a black eye,'' said Elissa Myers, president of the Electronic Retailing Association, a group of about 5,500 businesses that market their products on the Internet, radio and television. ''You have a category spinning out of control, where claims are being made that absolutely challenge credulity.''</p>
        <p>Out of ''enlightened self-interest,'' as Ms. Myers put it, the association has begun referring egregious marketing claims to the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates advertising. In April, the collaboration led to one of the largest false advertising settlements, a $10 million judgment against Enforma Natural Products for best-selling pills called Exercise in a Bottle and Fat Trapper.</p>
        <p>Then, in early September, the F.T.C. followed up by suing the product's celebrity endorser, Steve Garvey, the former baseball All Star, who urged TV watchers to indulge cravings for barbecued chicken and ribs ''without guilt, without worry.''</p>
        <p>Taken together, F.T.C. officials say the two actions mark the beginning of their most aggressive crackdown ever on the industry. Yet they acknowledge that the agency can do little to curb the boom in fraudulent companies.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot more of them than there are of us, and under no foreseeable circumstance is enforcement going to address this problem,'' said Richard Cleland, senior lawyer in the F.T.C.'s advertising division. ''It can only set the example.''</p>
        <p>A Law Gives Birth To a Flurry of Products</p>
        <p>Government enforcement has a spotty record on diet fraud. In the 1990's, spurred by Congressional hearings on weight loss advertising, the F.T.C. brought five times more cases against weight loss companies for misleading advertising than in any other decade. The actions generated settlements with some of the industry's best-known companies, including Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers, requiring them to inform customers how much weight they can realistically expect to lose.</p>
        <p>In a 1997 effort called ''Operation Waistline,'' the agency filed lawsuits against seven companies in a single day, taking aim at lesser-known products like SeQuester, a plant-based fiber that supposedly blocks the absorption of fat, and Slimming Insoles, which claimed to trigger weight loss by pressing on nerves in the foot. But for all its efforts, the agency now estimates that consumers spend $6 billion on fraudulent diet products annually, 20 percent more than four years ago.</p>
        <p>As a result, the commission intends to step up enforcement by filing more lawsuits and seeking greater penalties. Still, F.T.C. officials warn that hundreds of new companies have put out dubious products on the Internet in the past few years, emboldened by the knowledge that the agency's handful of regulators, who often need years to pursue a case, cannot scrutinize them all.</p>
        <p>To be sure, dieters have long been seduced by implausible claims. Some of the earliest cases brought by the F.T.C. against weight loss companies in the 1930's were for bath salts and massage creams that supposedly dissolved fat. But the number of questionable products on the market today is unprecedented, industry groups and regulators say, especially with the introduction of dietary supplements, an enormous category that did not exist before the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was passed.</p>
        <p>Before 1994, the F.D.A. had to approve ingredients used in over-the-counter weight loss products, prompting companies to spend millions of dollars on studies to show that their pills, powders and other elixirs actually helped people lose weight. But the legislation eliminated that preapproval process, allowing manufacturers to put herb extracts and other weight loss supplements directly on the market without first proving they work.</p>
        <p>The new law does not allow supplement manufacturers to spout claims at will. Companies are required to notify the F.D.A. when they put new products on shelves, and can be sued by the agency for making false promises. But that rarely happens. There are more than 25,000 dietary supplements on the market for virtually every ailment, according to the F.D.A. Yet the agency has only 8,000 products on file. Of those, few have ever been reviewed by the F.D.A. for safety, much less for efficacy.</p>
        <p>''We simply don't have the resources to investigate them all,'' said Dr. Christine Lewis, director of the F.D.A.'s office of nutritional products, labeling and dietary supplements. Although the law has led to a surge of new products, Dr. Lewis added, it did not authorize money for any additional inspectors.</p>
        <p>Diet products often go untested by manufacturers as well, F.D.A. officials and health professionals say. In a review of the most popular weight loss agents found in dietary supplements this year, including chitosan and ephedra, researchers at the Obesity Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York found that most had undergone limited and inconclusive studies, or none at all, offering little evidence to support advertisers' claims.</p>
        <p>''Most of these magic pill manufacturers don't want clinical trials,'' said Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, a professor of medicine at Columbia University who heads the obesity center.  ''They try to sell as much as they can and, if they eventually get closed down, well, they try something else.''</p>
        <p>Some supplements are potentially dangerous, and many health professionals blame loose regulatory controls for the recent rash of illnesses attributed to ephedra, an herbal stimulant suspected by the F.D.A. of causing at least 17 deaths.</p>
        <p>Despite the potential risks, sales of dietary supplements for weight loss are booming, in part because the anti-obesity prescription medications remaining on the market --  Xenical and Meridia -- cost more, are rarely covered by insurance and yield only modest outcomes. According to a June survey by the Calorie Control Council, a diet industry group, one in four dieters now take dietary supplements, up 39 percent from two years ago.</p>
        <p>So popular have dietary supplements become that thousands of independent distributors now sell them on the Internet, mostly from home computers, flooding chat rooms, electronic bulletin boards and auction sites like eBay with advertisements. Gil Gruber, chief operating officer of Dietwatch.com, a Web diet site that endorses no particular method of losing weight, says he rejects at least 10 requests a week from companies that want to advertise on the site because they cannot substantiate their claims -- and often do not even try.</p>
        <p>''They make all kinds of ridiculous statements like, 'Lose weight while you sleep,' '' he said. ''We're a real target for that. There's no regulation on the Web.''</p>
        <p>A Sales Pitch Based on Faith</p>
        <p>Whatever the product, the F.T.C. requires advertisers to have proof of their claims. But in many cases vendors know very little about the diet products they sell, much less the science behind them. Jason Green, a casino worker from Louisiana, sells 35 to 50 bars of Aoqili soap each week. On his Web site, he details how dieters can ''just step into the shower to wash away fat,'' careful to describe how the soap penetrates the pores and jump-starts the metabolism. The site claims that users can shed 25 pounds in two months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green said he had never talked to the manufacturer, a company in Guangxi, China, that he knows only from the packaging. Nor has he talked with the distributor who sells him the soap, except to place orders. In fact, everything he knows about the product -- and what he is allowed to say when marketing it -- comes from surfing the Internet to see what his fellow vendors claim, without any input from the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>''They just leave it up to me,'' Mr. Green said. Wing Hop Fung Ginseng Inc., the Los Angeles company that supplies him with the soap, confirmed that it provides no information on the product's efficacy.</p>
        <p>As cable stations multiply, industry groups say that television has become increasingly susceptible to questionable claims as well. Spending on infomercials for weight loss products has soared, to $107.5 million in 1999 from $43.1 million in 1995. Last year, advertising for weight loss products grew faster than any other infomercial category, according to Response magazine, which tracks television marketing.</p>
        <p>''With the fragmentation of the viewing audience, television stations are in many cases looking the other way and accepting anything that has significant dollars attached,'' the retailers association's Ms. Myers said.</p>
        <p>Without self-regulation by the industry, many diet companies concede that the rise in fraudulent advertising is likely to continue unabated. As a result, a working group of government regulators, health officials and some of the industry's biggest companies has begun urging businesses to publicly endorse a set of advertising rules that go beyond federal requirements.</p>
        <p>But the pledge is entirely voluntary, leaving many to question its potential impact on the industry.</p>
        <p>''When you have someone selling snake oil,'' the business bureau's Ms. Levine said, ''self-regulation probably isn't the best form of control.''</p>
