        <p>The trial nearly two years ago of an alleged Russian mobster, Sergei Mikhailov, was unprecedented by the standards of Swiss justice. In a country largely free of violent crime, the trial lasted eight days, with unusually tight security, down to bulletproof vests for police officers in the courtroom.</p>
        <p>Geneva authorities touted the December 1998 trial as a showcase for their determination to crack down on laundering ill-gotten funds through Swiss banks. Newly wealthy Russians were streaming into Switzerland, and there had been suspicions that not all their riches were legitimate. The Swiss federal prosecutor warned that Russian mob money was pouring in and that people fronting for the mob were buying up legitimate businesses and property.</p>
        <p>The evidence presented against Mr. Mikhailov was so weak, however, that the money-laundering complaint against him was thrown out. Then the jury acquitted him of charges that he led an organized crime group. Mr. Mikhailov headed back to Moscow a free man, and promptly demanded $1 million in compensation for his ordeal, which included payment for wages lost during his 778 days in Swiss prison before and during the trial.</p>
        <p>To the dismay of Geneva prosecutors, a local court last month awarded the 43-year-old Russian a record 810,000 Swiss francs, worth $450,000 at today's exchange rate.</p>
        <p>The award stirred a furor. Local newspapers, fuming, noted the amount was double that awarded to a person wrongly accused of murder who spent more than five years in prison, and more than five times the amount won by a bank employee acquitted on charges that he participated in the country's biggest bank robbery.</p>
        <p>Legal authorities considered it a serious setback to their efforts to give an unequivocal signal that Geneva is no longer a haven for dubious funds.</p>
        <p>The municipal authorities who would have to pay Mr. Mikhailov immediately appealed to Switzerland's highest court, arguing that the award exceeded the legal limit of $5,500 for cases of wrongful prosecution. However, there are exceptions, and the federal tribunal in Lausanne agreed that Mr. Mikhailov's case was one of them.</p>
        <p>The tribunal's ruling last week revived the debate, with Mr. Mikhailov adding to the ire with an interview in a Swiss magazine conducted while he was reclining by his indoor swimming pool, lined with elaborate murals depicting the Russian countryside.</p>
        <p>The controversy highlights the difficulties that Swiss authorities are having in cracking down on money laundering, where a conviction requires proof of an underlying crime -- in other words, that the money came from a proven illegal action.</p>
        <p>Swiss officials complain that Russian authorities have been less than helpful in furnishing such evidence. Prosecutors have encountered the same difficulties in obtaining documents in other high-profile cases involving Russia, including suspicions that Swiss companies bribed the family of the former president, Boris N. Yeltsin, for contracts involving elaborate renovations of the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>Even American law enforcement has come in for low-key criticism. In Mr. Mikhailov's case, a former F.B.I. agent testified that the Russian was not a businessman, but was linked to a criminal group running illegal operations in Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. Disgruntled experts who followed the trial said the Geneva authorities had hoped for stronger evidence from the United States.</p>
        <p>The exceptionally high award to Mr. Mikhailov was also considered a warning to Geneva's legal authorities who, in recent years, have been eager to prosecute money laundering. ''It's a very important case because it gives a lesson to aggressive prosecutors,'' said Carlo Lombardini, a lawyer who has specialized in cases involving alleged money laundering. ''They could have just let Mikhailov leave the city, but instead they went ahead with the charges.''</p>
        <p>Mark Pieth, a Swiss academic who is an expert on money laundering, said the award could be a backlash supported by the banking industry, which has complained that the Swiss crackdown on money laundering has gone much further than other countries, and that high-profile cases could discourage people from putting legitimate money into Swiss banks.</p>
