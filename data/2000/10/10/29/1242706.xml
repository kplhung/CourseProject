        <p>ENVIRONMENTAL groups said last week that a ballot proposal in Suffolk County threatens to severely limit voter-approved acquisitions of open space and farm development rights at a time when the fate of many of these lands is about to be determined.</p>
        <p>The proposal, which appears on the Nov. 7 ballot as Proposal Two, asks whether the county should adopt a ''pay as you go'' standard for spending a portion of the 0.25 percent county sales tax dedicated to the acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Suffolk's elected officials support the proposal as fiscally prudent, though some who backed it have now had second thoughts. But the environmental groups, which hastily formed a coalition to call for defeat of the proposal, said approval would have disastrous results that officials normally supportive of environmental programs may not have grasped.</p>
        <p>They said borrowing aggressively against future revenues in order to acquire as much land as possible now was the only way to make a dent in raging development before it was too late.</p>
        <p>Under a revised program overwhelmingly approved by county voters a year ago, revenues from the 0.25 percent sales tax will also be used for tax stabilization and to relieve financial pressure on county sewer districts. The revision takes effect Dec. 1 but will not change Suffolk's current sales tax rate of 8.25 percent.</p>
        <p>If Proposal Two were approved, it would limit annual borrowing costs for acquisitions to no more than one-fourth of the revenues that were received in the same year and earmarked for acquisitions. Supporters said this would leave more money for land and rights purchases over the life of the program and prevent exhausting the fund in its early years by borrowing more heavily.</p>
        <p>The environmental groups, led by the Nature Conservancy, said the approach was misguided and would mean that money for acquisitions, projected by the county at about $176 million by the time the tax expires in 2013, would be reduced to a yearly trickle at a time when development pressure required maximum preservation efforts.</p>
        <p>''We are very concerned about the consequences this would have for acquisitions which we see as necessary now,'' said Stuart Lowrie, the director of government relations for the Nature Conservancy. ''These lands could be developed and lost forever.''</p>
        <p>In some cases, the group said, key properties were ''under imminent threat of development, with bulldozers literally weeks or months away from destroying them forever.''</p>
        <p>But Paul Sabatino, the counsel to the county Legislature, said heavy borrowing early in the program would have negative consequences. ''Instead of putting money into land acquisitions, we would be putting it into the pocket of bond holders,'' he said. ''You get immediate gratification because you have the money in your hands earlier, but the price you pay is that you have less money in later years.''</p>
        <p>A statement issued by the conservancy, a longtime partner in Suffolk land preservation programs, suggested that greater borrowing now would result in more land for less money because potential acquisitions, in addition to being scarcer, would be far more expensive in the future.</p>
        <p>The statement said the cap on borrowing would mean that only about $1.75 million of the $7 million in estimated annual sales tax revenues available for acquisitions could be used to pay borrowing costs. Over the life of the program, the group said, borrowing would be limited to about $30 million, sharply retarding the pace of acquisitions.</p>
        <p>The conservancy and other groups said that by maximizing purchasing power now through greater borrowing, the county could buy more land over the 13-year life of the program. It said interest rates below 3 percent were available through a state fund for environmental programs.</p>
        <p>''This would really hamper our efforts for land acquisition on the East End,'' said Debra O'Kane, executive director of the North Fork Environmental Council in Mattituck. ''The land is just being bought up at breakneck speed. If real estate prices continue to rise, who knows what the prices will be a few years from now?''</p>
        <p>Under the program, 32.15 percent of the revenues will go toward property tax relief, while 35.7 percent will be used to stabilize tax rates in various county sewer districts, predominantly in western Suffolk.</p>
        <p>Of the remaining revenues, 13.55 percent is for open space acquisition, 7.35 percent for farms and farm rights and 11.25 percent for groundwater protection.</p>
        <p>The new program replaces an earlier one begun in 1989, which committed a 0.25 percent sales tax for specific environmental uses. At the time, the county projected revenues from the tax would exceed $570 million. As the program nears expiration, the Legislature's budget review office estimated the final total would be about $395 million.</p>
        <p>In an early purchase that became controversial, Suffolk borrowed against future sales tax revenues to pay $16 million in April 1990 for more than 1,400 acres in the pine barrens of Southampton and an additional $1,868,400 for development rights to an 18-hole golf course on the property. Developers had proposed a 307-unit housing development on a portion of the property, and had agreed to give the rest to the county and the Town of Southampton.</p>
        <p>The land is now in the core area of the 100,000-acre Long Island Pine Barrens state preserve. But critics of the purchase said Suffolk paid too much at a time when real estate prices were beginning to decline and could have preserved most of the land for free by accepting the developers' gift.</p>
        <p>''You are talking about an a project that would have gone forward on 25 percent of the property and given the other 75 percent of the property to the county for free,'' said Michael J. Caracciolo, a Republican county legislator from Baiting Hollow. ''Instead Suffolk paid more than $18 million, and we'll pay $35 million with interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Caracciolo said he supported Proposal Two to prevent similar mistakes in the future. ''Once the voters know the facts they will overwhelmingly support this proposition,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The current Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, supports the proposal.</p>
        <p>But a Democratic legislator, Ginny Fields of Islip Terrace, said she regretted her vote in favor of putting the proposal on the ballot. ''It was 'pay as you go' and it just sounded like the right thing to do,'' she said. ''But what it does is limit county borrowing, and I foresee the county would not be able to purchase very much land if it is approved.''</p>
        <p>Another Democratic legislator, David Bishop in Lindenhurst, said voters would have to guess at future real estate prices to decide how to vote on the proposal. ''If you believe the real estate market is going to continue to exponentially grow, then you vote against it,'' he said. ''If you believe the market is going to taper off and diminish, then voting yes makes a lot of sense.''</p>
