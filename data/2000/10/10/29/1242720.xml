        <p>Muller-Thurgau, a hybrid grape that the eminent British critic Hugh Johnson wants banned from top vineyards in Germany because of its wimpy wines there, has found a new identity, respect and pizazz in Oregon.</p>
        <p>Last year, 15 producers turned out 25,147 cases, up from 20,042 in 1998.</p>
        <p>Chateau Benoit in the Willamette Valley so prizes this white hybrid, which is partly riesling and partly Chasselas (a major Swiss grape), that it makes 7,500 cases a year, compared with 1,000 of chardonnay, which can be a sure-fire profit maker.</p>
        <p>Benoit's lovely, near-dry, addictive '98 Muller-Thurgau is tastier and has more panache than 85 percent of the standard-issue chardonnays I encounter. And it's much more food friendly.</p>
        <p>''Heat needs sweet,'' Peter Poster, Benoit's vice president, told the Wine Business Monthly, a California publication. ''When you are having hot food, the sweetness coats the palate and takes the edge off. Muller-Thurgau goes very well with Caribbean, Tex-Mex, Thai and Sichuan cooking.''</p>
        <p>It's hard to decide what's most appealing in Benoit's charmer: its floral-pineapple-honey aroma; intricate, seamless, fruit-salad flavor; kiwi-like piquancy and grapefruity acidity, enlivened by a spritz (like J. J. Prum's memorable Mosel kabinett rieslings in Germany), which combine to create a cavernous appetite; or its 10-minute-long aftertaste.</p>
        <p>The Muller-Thurgau costs $7 in Arlington Wine and Liquor, 718 Dutchess Turnpike (Arlington Square shopping center), Pougkeepsie. It is $8 at both Suburban Wine, 379 Downing Drive, Yorktown Heights, and Viscount, 1173 Route 9, Wappingers Falls.</p>
        <p>At this price-quality ratio, it's worth buying at least half a case. (The distributor is C. Daniele, in Manhattan.)</p>
        <p>The good news, said Scott Huffman, the winemaker, is that Chateau Benoit's '99 Muller-Thurgau, which may reach Westchester in December, is even juicier than the '98's. He's right.</p>
