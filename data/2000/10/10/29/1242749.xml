        <p>To the Editor: The article about Ani, ''A Hidden Empire in Turkey'' (Oct. 8), took me back to 1965, when, as a Peace Corps volunteer, I was assigned to teach English in Kars. One of the highlights of that year was my first trip to Ani. Part of the closed military zone since World War II, it had been reopened in 1964. Then a permit was a bit more difficult to get, and there was little mention of Ani's Armenian origin. On our trip, we were accompanied by a plainclothes policeman. We rode out in an old bus with Turkish villagers and three sheep.</p>
        <p>We were warned not to take pictures facing the Russian border. A Turkish border guard had been shot shortly before our visit, and we could see sunlight glinting off binoculars in the Russian watchtowers across the Arpa River.</p>

        <p>Since then I have visited many ancient cities, but never with the overpowering sense of the passage of time and the insignificance of man that I experienced in the middle of that plain when I first saw the faint outlines that had been streets and buildings in a great city.</p>
