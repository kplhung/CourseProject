        <p>A GOOD HOUSE</p>
        <p>By Bonnie Burnard.</p>
        <p>309 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Henry Holt &amp; Company. $25.</p>
        <p>WHEN Bonnie Burnard's first novel opens, the year is 1949, and things are humming along in the southern Ontario town of Stonebrook, near the shore of Lake Huron. Brimming with postwar optimism, Stonebrook's strikingly solid citizens are busy buying Frigidaires and chunky new sedans, and the scene, you can't help thinking, is about as spicy as the opening montage of ''The Andy Griffith Show.'' Stonebrook is pure Mayberry, and readers who've grown accustomed to fiction filled with dysfunction might wonder whether these sensible folks actually warrant our attention, since they seem to have everything so squarely under control. But Burnard soon proves, in this increasingly intricate and rewarding book, to have a keen appreciation for the sad, surprising, joyous, important things that happen to people whose lives, by every demographic measure, could be called normal in the extreme.</p>
        <p>Divided into chapters dated years or decades apart, ''A Good House'' tracks the Chambers family for almost 50 years. In 1949, Bill Chambers, a hardware salesman, and his wife, Sylvia, are living in a modest split-level abutting Stonebrook Creek with their two sons, Patrick and Paul, and daughter, Daphne, ''hoping against hope'' for nothing fancier than to be ''comfortable.'' Yet when Sylvia dies a few years later, it is only the first of many life-shifting events that the ever-expanding Chambers clan will be forced to endure.</p>
        <p>At times, Burnard's everything-including-the-kitchen-sink storytelling style can seem almost aggressively old-fashioned. (In a typical scene, Margaret, who marries Bill after Sylvia's death, makes a critical decision about the role she'll take within this wounded family while she's washing dishes.) More often than not, though, Burnard's painstaking focus on seemingly mundane details makes the events that shape her characters' lives not only believable but also somehow bigger than the moment, universally true.</p>
        <p>Advancing with no more complicated engine than the inevitable progress of time, ''A Good House'' is not a book in which the revelation of dark secrets rocks the plot. Instead, the book's pleasure lies in its ability slowly to expose the patterns that lie below the changes in these various lives, changes that may seem strange at first but eventually become part of the family's intimate fabric. Devoting portions of her chapters to the points of view of most of the Chambers clan, Burnard explores the many perspectives of these often flawed but always decent people.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the book, which concludes with a 1997 wedding, the realization of how much the family has evolved comes as a great, bittersweet revelation. Metaphorically, the good house of the title has expanded to shelter a large number of people, no matter how they might have strayed from the family Bill and Sylvia imagined back in 1949. But as their daughter realizes, watching her nephew at the wedding party, even those who once saw themselves as the vanguard can be schooled by the next generation.</p>
        <p>Though the usually subtle architecture of ''A Good House'' suffers when Burnard occasionally inserts an overly symbolic contemporary event (like the publication of ''The Feminine Mystique''), it's easy to forgive these brief lapses in her otherwise strict policy of showing rather than telling what's on her characters' minds. What you realize, reading her work, is just how much other writers skate on the surface, quickly flashing easy cultural references. In contrast, Burnard knows the importance of tuning in to specifics, of shying away from shallow assumptions.</p>
        <p>At 81, Bill's second wife, the ever-wise Margaret, notes that ''her usual feeling of well-being'' can be credited to nothing trickier than ''her day-to-day living, and to the quiet, lifelong, persistent energy that day-to-day living demanded.'' In a time when there seems to be a marked deficit in attention being paid to something as simple -- and yet mysterious -- as the way a ''good house'' can nurture a family, Burnard reminds us that patience may well be its cornerstone.</p>
