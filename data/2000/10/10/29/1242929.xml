        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As an Oct. 24 news article says,  employers often intimidate or fire union supporters. This is the most egregious and visible violation of workers' freedom of association. But the employers' fight doesn't stop when unions win organizing drives.</p>
        <p>In about one-third of organizing victories, unions are unable to get their first collective agreements and establish bargaining relationships. Management doesn't just bargain hard; it bargains with the intent of getting rid of the union by subterfuge and delay and, if there are strikes, by replacing striking workers.</p>
        <p>Any attempt to strengthen labor laws must protect not only the freedom to choose a union but also the right to bargain through that union.</p>
        <p>GARY CHAISON  Worcester, Mass., Oct. 24, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of industrial relations at Clark University's Graduate School of Management.</p>
