        <p>To the Editor: My grandmother used to go to Germany every year for the mud baths in Bad Nauheim. During Prohibition, she was approached by the ship's captain the night before the ship docked in New York. He told her he had a bottle of Champagne for her if she could get it through Customs. Grandma tied the bottle to a string around her waist so it dangled between her legs, which she covered with a long skirt. As she walked down the gangplank the next morning the captain rushed up and said that he hoped she had not put the bottle in a warm place as it might explode.</p>
        <p>Nothing daunted, Grandma, small but spunky, went through Customs, walking confidently if somewhat gingerly. Nothing happened.</p>

        <p>I always figured no bottle of Champagne would dare explode under those circumstances!</p>
