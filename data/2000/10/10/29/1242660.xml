        <p>The rail trip between New York City and Albany will be cut by 30 minutes, to about two hours, as rebuilt high-speed French-designed turboliners are put into service and tracks and signals are upgraded to accommodate them.</p>
        <p>The first of seven high-speed trains being rebuilt by SuperSteel of Schenectady, N.Y., is expected to be in service between New York City and Albany by the end of the year; an additional train is supposed to be put on line every four to six months thereafter. The diesel-powered trains can travel at up to 125 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Each rebuilt train costs $10.8 million and is being paid for by Amtrak and the New York State Department of Transportation. The turbotrains, made up of two power cars, two coaches and a cafe car, were originally put into service in the mid-1970's.</p>
        <p>Amtrak currently provides 13 daily round trips between New York City and Albany. The fare for service aboard a turboliner will remain the same, starting at $40 one way. Reservations: (800) 872-7245 or at www .amtrak.com.</p>
