        <p>THE fall of Slobodan Milosevic is a  disaster  at least for Kosovo's hopes for independence. The election in Belgrade of the apparently reasonable, legally minded Serb, Vojislav Kostunica, has spoiled that dream, and consequently, Kosovo has become a more explosive place, providing a further test for Western troops and diplomacy.</p>
        <p>NATO bombed Yugoslavia for 78 days last year to save Kosovo's Albanians and drive Serbian authorities out of the province, hoping that Mr. Milosevic himself would be collateral damage. Albanian refugees returned and Kosovo became a Western protectorate, managed by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO-led troops, who watched without much concern as half the province's Serbian population and nearly all of its Gypsies were expelled or fled.</p>
        <p>In Western eyes, Mr. Milosevic's undeniable awfulness (politicians and diplomats cheerfully called him ''evil'' and ''the Hitler of the Balkans'') justified nearly anything that happened in Kosovo -- revenge in the pursuit of liberty was no vice. There has been much tut-tutting about the organized efforts of some Albanians to pursue independence by driving the non-Albanian minority from Kosovo, but few arrests by Western troops unwilling to confront the majority and risk casualties.</p>
        <p>The United Nations administrator of Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, liked to say that he saw his job as preparing Kosovo for independence, meaning independence from Mr. Milosevic, as if the Serbs themselves were incapable of acting on their own revulsion. A number of senior American officials privately shared this view.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kouchner was going -- or talking -- way beyond his brief. In the United Nations Security Council resolution that ended the war and governs Mr. Kouchner, there is no discussion, let alone promise, of independence for Kosovo. Resolution 1244 ''reconfirms the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' of which Kosovo remains a part. Kosovo is promised only ''substantial autonomy and self-government'' after a period of international supervision.</p>
        <p>Saturday's local elections in Kosovo, although subject to a boycott by Kosovo's Serbs, constitute an important first step in building institutions of self-government, and they will be followed in the spring by elections for some form of legislature. But those institutions, as well as the province's status are provisional, ''pending a final settlement,'' as the resolution says. And that settlement is to be negotiated, under international auspices, between Kosovo's ''provisional democratic self-governing institutions'' and Belgrade.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Milosevic ruled, such negotiations were ''impossible to imagine,'' a senior Western diplomat said. But in Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer who vows to defend Serb interests, Kosovo's Albanians have the interlocutor of their nightmares.</p>
        <p>''For a long time, everyone fell into a bad habit, which was to ignore anything that came out of Belgrade because it had the Milosevic tag on it,'' the diplomat said. ''Everything he articulated was by definition bad, because he articulated it. For 10 years, we let everyone behave badly because they could say, well, Milosevic behaves worse. But the election of Kostunica is a blow to extremists of all kinds in the region -- Albanian as well as Serb.''</p>
        <p>That means the quiet slide toward independence in Kosovo is over just as surely as in Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, whose president, Milo Djukanovic, also bet on Mr. Milosevic remaining in power. But while Montenegro is clearly torn between those who favor ties to Serbia and those who don't, some 95 percent of Kosovars are now thought to be ethnic Albanian, and few admit to any hope other than independence.</p>
        <p>Few Serbs in Kosovo, however, let alone those 100,000 or so who want to return and cannot, currently believe they can be safe in an independent Kosovo. And Mr. Kostunica has already made clear that he will press, over time, for the safe return of Serbs -- a goal American envoy James C. O'Brien assured him in their first meeting that Washington supported.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Brien also confirmed Washington's support for Resolution 1244, which could not be changed in any event without the support of all permanent members of the Security Council, including Belgrade allies Moscow and Beijing.</p>
        <p>So the situation in Kosovo is likely to become more explosive, not less, ensuring the need for NATO troops to remain for a long time to come. The reason? Independence is likely to become not just a dream deferred, but denied. And as the contradiction between Western verbal encouragement for Albanian self-determination and its opposition to independence becomes clear, the potential for violence against NATO troops will grow.</p>
        <p>The same may be said of Albanian politicians. All of them, from the more moderate, pacifist Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the Democratic League of Kosovo, to the former Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaci, support independence. But with Mr. Kostunica as a negotiating partner, politicians like Mr. Rugova are going to have to consider options short of independence. And  that could place their own lives at risk.</p>
        <p>THE newly altered landscape is precisely what makes Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's recent promise to pull American soldiers out of Balkan peacekeeping duties so wrongheaded, says Ivo Daalder, a Balkans expert and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''Kosovo was an American-led war with an American-dominated outcome, so to pull out now, when the Albanians feel under the most pressure since the end of the war, is likely to increase the overall risk to all troops there,'' he said. ''It would be viewed by the Europeans and the Albanians as a betrayal.''</p>
        <p>Veton Surroi, an Albanian moderate and newspaper publisher, once said that Kosovar Albanians wouldn't be governed from Belgrade even if the Serbs elected Mother Teresa to replace Mr. Milosevic, an echo of quip by Richard Holbrooke, United States ambassador to the United Nations. The Albanians would want independence ''even if Thomas Jefferson were running Serbia,'' said Mr. Holbrooke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica is neither, but he will insist on Belgrade's rights under Resolution 1244. Ultimately, the future of Kosovo must be resolved between Belgrade and Pristina, the Kosovo capital. This will doubtless prove difficult, but the prospect of democratic leaders in both cities opens up a far more realistic landscape than the current imperial protectorate.</p>
        <p>''Serbs and Albanians don't get along,'' said one senior diplomat. ''Fine. But there are a lot of options, and the good news is that we can start discussing those options intelligently, with elected representatives, and they can talk for a long time. That has to be better than what we have now, which is no implementation of 1244 and Kosovo as a member of NATO forever.''</p>
        <p>NATO forces can't leave Kosovo until the Serbs and the Albanians negotiate a solution, he said, or there will be another war. ''The Serbs have to buy into any solution, or it's hopeless,'' he said. ''Sooner or later, the Albanians will realize that.''</p>
