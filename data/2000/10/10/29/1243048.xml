        <p>An unspecified number of Arabs were detained in Yemen in the Oct. 12 attack on the destroyer Cole, and Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, said local and American investigators had tentatively concluded that they belonged to the Islamic Jihad.</p>
        <p>He was apparently referring to the group linked to the World Trade Center bombing and to Osama bin Laden, the much-hunted terrorist. Security was tightened for the American team in Aden after they received a bomb threat.</p>
