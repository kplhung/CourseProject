        <p>BERT GARSKOF remembers hunkering down beside the radio with his family as a boy growing up in New York. Sixty years later he feels the same excitement when he performs on radio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garskof will record his own adaptation of Bram Stoker's ''Dracula'' in front of a live audience tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in the Clarice L. Buckman Theater at Quinnipiac University, where he is a psychology professor. ''Dracula Comes to Quinnipiac,'' which will be directed by his wife, Ellen Lieberman, will be broadcast at 3:05 p.m. next Sunday over WQUN AM 1220.</p>
        <p>''I love radio because I grew up with it,'' said Mr. Garskof, 67. ''Radio dramas have a charm. Maybe it's nostalgic.''</p>
        <p>Those old enough to remember when the radio was the entertainment center of the house will be able to wax nostalgic listening to the show by Mr. Garskof and Ms. Lieberman. What they will be getting, however, is not the traditional version of Bram Stoker's vampire story. Instead Count Roman Contesceu will arrive at Quinnipiac University on Halloween from his native Transylvania to teach -- what else? -- psychology.</p>
        <p>Contesceu comes to research ancient native American tales that werewolves once roamed Sleeping Giant, Mr. Garskof said from Bethany, where he and Ms. Lieberman live. He wants to find a book he has traced to the university's Arnold Bernhard Library. It supposedly contains the satanic rite that will double his productivity and allow him to function as Dracula by day as well as night.</p>
        <p>The Count refreshes himself with a deep, daytime snooze in the basement of one of the university's residence halls. He casts a spell on Renfeld, a Quinnipiac student who has become his slave and research assistant (a redundancy?), and falls in love with Lucy, a resident assistant.</p>
        <p>''It's a campy show,'' Mr. Garskof said. ''We're intending on having a lot of fun with it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garskof and Ms. Lieberman, who have been married 10 years, own Dandelion Productions, which creates non-Equity shows for young audiences for the National Theater for the Performing Arts in Westport. They currently have five different shows touring, including a version of ''The Diary of Anne Frank.''</p>
        <p>The couple first ventured into radio drama in 1992. Mr. Garskof wrote a script called ''The Black Rose Murder,'' based on the old Nick Carter Master Detective radio series of the 1940's. They broadcast the show over WSHU in Fairfield from the Shubert Theater in New Haven.</p>
        <p>''We even got in touch with Lon Clark, who played Nick Carter on radio,'' said Ms. Lieberman, whose brother is Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate. ''He agreed to do it.  The morning of the broadcast, we received a call that Lon was hospitalized. We called an actor friend who came and did a great job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garskof and Ms. Lieberman continued producing nostalgic radio shows. Not discouraged by their bad luck with Mr. Clark, they brought Ezra Stone to reprise the title role of the popular radio program ''The Henry Aldrich Show.'' Before long, their Quinnipiac Radio Theater was presenting about three different shows each year.</p>
        <p>''Dracula Comes to Quinnipiac'' marks the fourth time the couple has brought the vampire story to the airwaves. Each time Mr. Garskof writes a new adaptation. There will probably be more since Mr. Garskof and the administration have secured financing for six Quinnipiac Radio Theater productions for next year.</p>
        <p>That will give Ms. Lieberman a change of pace from her theater directing with Dandelion. Directing for radio, she said, is different from stage work. ''A radio director works like a conductor,'' she said. ''I control the actors' pace as they perform.''</p>
        <p>Her cast includes several Connecticut residents: Yves Feder in the title role; Gloria Pilot as Van Helsing; Daniel Hall as Renfiend; and Mr. Garskof as Seward.</p>
        <p>Keeping with the tradition of earlier radio performers, Ms. Lieberman will only rehearse one hour before airtime. She loosens up her studio audience up with a pre-show warm-up. ''Then we encourage them to close their eyes and use their imagination,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That may seem a large request of an audience that has been raised on the visual entertainment of television and computer games. But Mr. Garskof said the imagination of the younger radio audience was alive and well.</p>
        <p>''The reaction I see in the younger audiences tells me that people respond to radio,'' he said. ''It's still vital.''</p>
        <p>''Dracula Comes to Quinnipiac,'' an Evening at Quinnipiac Radio Theater, will be recorded in front of a live audience at 7:30 p.m. on Monday in the Clarice L. Buckman Theater at Quinnipiac. The event, which is free, will be broadcast on WQUN-AM (1220) at 3:05 p.m. on Nov. 5. Information: (203) 582-8652.</p>
