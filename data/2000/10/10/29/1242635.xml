        <p>After pulling copies of the past few months' magazines off my shelf, I noted that most of the pictures in What They Were Thinking were of typical Americans caught in their daily activities -- over all, an absorbing portrait of American life in 2000. Imagine my puzzlement, then, when on Oct. 8, we were treated to a 1997 shot of Bill Clinton and several of his advisers in the Map Room. And lo, there are Al and Tipper, engaging in their now familiar conjugal kiss. Was this to ensure that no one is unaware of Al's acclaimed uxoriousness? I hope to see a similarly touching portrait of the Bushes in the coming weeks.</p>
