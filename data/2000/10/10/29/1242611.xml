        <p>DOGRUN</p>
        <p>By Arthur Nersesian.</p>
        <p>MTV/Pocket Books, paper, $12.95.</p>
        <p>The narrator of this Lower East Side story routinely sleeps too late, forgets to walk her dog and drinks three cocktails too many. As Mary Bellanova nears her 30th birthday, the future looks grim. She has bounced from job to job: Kinko's, Starbucks, mind-numbing temp work. She experiences vague dreams of true love, but the men she meets in bars and clubs irritate her; most of her sexual encounters begin and end in a mood of burned-out sarcasm. As the novel opens, her soon-to-be-dumped boyfriend dies on her couch while watching television. It takes Mary a couple of hours to realize he's dead. She even fixes his corpse dinner (''overcooked pasta with crushed garlic'') and becomes annoyed when he refuses to eat. With ''Dogrun,'' Arthur Nersesian -- the former managing editor of The Portable Lower East Side, a literary magazine, and the author of two previous novels -- has written an intermittently funny novel that mines overly familiar territory. Mary and her friends are hip slackers, ''attention-deficit-disorder-suffering East Villagers.'' At night they listen to derivative punk bands in smoky clubs. Halfway through the novel, Mary joins a girl group called the Beautiful and the Crazy. Her short adventure as a bass player proves a rich parody of the all-girl punk band -- a once subversive institution that has become commonplace. Like chain stores, girl groups seem to form on every corner of Mary's neighborhood, each a copy of the last. Despite this flash of freshness, Nersesian's novel suffers from multiple flaws: awkward dialogue, ill-conceived characters, disembodied generalizations about ''culture.'' Hovering between parody and self-seriousness, ''Dogrun'' never develops much momentum. It's a late 90's story, and from the beginning it feels like it's already over.</p>
