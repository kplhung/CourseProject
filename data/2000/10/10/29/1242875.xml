        <p>IT'S not just the house, cars and investment portfolios that are being contested in divorce settlements and inheritance disputes these days. In a growing number of families, the fights also involve airline frequent-flier miles.</p>
        <p>Battling for miles, however, is not like arguing over stock options or mutual funds. Miles accumulated through airline frequent-flier programs are often considered a more emotional asset, like an art collection, a beloved sports car or Yankees season tickets.</p>
        <p>''To some people, the annual trip on the Concorde, or the two trips a year to Florida, is something they've always done'' with their airline miles, said Raoul L. Felder, the prominent Manhattan divorce lawyer. ''It represents a continuum.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Felder and other lawyers say they have seen a steady increase in mileage disputes among their clients -- partly because more people are collecting miles in more ways than ever before. Aside from the usual credits from flights, car rentals, hotel stays and purchases with airline-affiliated credit cards, miles are now offered as carrots for trading stocks, buying cars, taking out mortgages and even buying certain kinds of cereal.</p>
        <p>And mileage collection has become a mini-industry, complete with Web sites, magazines and even computer software for monitoring accounts.</p>
        <p>An estimated 70 million Americans now belong to frequent-flier programs -- up from 53 million five years ago and 27 million 10 years ago. And the number of banked miles is growing by 400 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Randy W. Petersen, editor of Inside Flyer magazine, which tracks frequent-flier programs throughout the industry, says many people do not regard airline miles as tangible assets and thus do not include them in their financial planning. ''Ninety percent of people don't directly address miles in their will or divorce settlement,'' he said, ''because they are viewed as funny money'' -- as ''not real.''</p>
        <p>BUT divorce and estate lawyers have been placing a value on air miles -- 2 cents apiece, the same amount, on average, that airlines charge when they sell miles to their corporate partners. Under that formula, an account containing a million miles would be worth $20,000; an estimated 123,000 people have accounts at least that big, according to Mr. Petersen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Felder suggested, with a tinge of sarcasm, that couples with 100,000 miles or more who are going through a divorce should ''make their 4,000 calls to the airlines and sort out with their spouse who gets the miles, then make it a precedent to signing the divorce agreement.'' Couples can also address the issue in prenuptial agreements, he said. ''Otherwise, they're going to be fighting over them for years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Petersen recommended that miles be covered in wills. ''In large estates that might be contested, you definitely need to point out where you want your miles to go,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Miles may be bequeathed to family members, friends or charities, but only about 10 percent of miles belonging to deceased account holders are ever claimed. ''It just has not even occured to most people to try to get their deceased spouse's miles,'' Mr. Petersen said. ''It's not something most people think about when their loved ones die.''</p>
        <p>In many marriages, one spouse accumulates the vast majority of a couple's frequent-flier miles through business travel, then uses them for the couple's joint vacations. In a divorce, the other spouse may make the legal argument that he or she shared in the miles during the marriage, just as paychecks or other assets were shared, so why not split them?</p>
        <p>Linda Zevallos, a mother of two from Dallas, said that she and her former husband, Dr. Pedro Zevallos, had agreed to split the miles in their divorce settlement, but that he used the bulk of them before the divorce was finalized. She said she was shocked when she called American Airlines days after her divorce and was told that there were only 543 miles left in her husband's account, down from more than 60,000.</p>
        <p>The loss of miles will reduce the number of trips she takes, she said. ''Now I'm going to have to drive,'' Mrs. Zevallos said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zevallos's lawyer, C. Gregory Shamoun of Dallas, said his client was legally entitled to use as many miles as he wanted during the divorce proceedings. ''If she didn't want him using those miles, she should have tried to obtain an injunction or restraining order to prevent it,'' Mr. Shamoun said. ''But even if she had tried to get such an order, I don't think any court would have entertained it.''</p>
        <p>David Carlock, a divorce lawyer in Dallas who represented Mrs. Zevallos, said frequent-flier miles ''are something that rear their ugly head after the big issues are put to bed.''</p>
        <p>Most airline policies say they distribute miles according to court decrees over wills and divorces. When more than one family member is named in a will, they say, they will leave it to the family to decide how to divide the miles. If a will does not make any stipulations about miles, the airlines say the miles are typically passed on to the named beneficiary of an estate, often the spouse.</p>
        <p>Even then, a family's battles may not be over. Retrieving miles can involve weeks of  paperwork and phone calls, especially if the deceased was a member of more than one frequent-flier program. Unless family members are persistent, and have the proper legal documents, many people will never see their beloved's miles, lawyers say. Some airlines require a death certificate; others also want copies of the will.</p>
        <p>''I stay real busy with people asking me to help them settle an estate issue with an airline,'' Mr. Petersen said. ''You can't give up at the first level of people you talk with. You've got to really stay after it.''</p>
        <p>REQUIREMENTS may also vary depending on the size of the account. For accounts with fewer than 50,000 miles, Delta Air Lines, for instance, requires a photocopy of a death certificate. For larger accounts, the airline requires an original death certificate, as well as a signed affidavit from the person requesting the miles.</p>
        <p>American Airlines, which originated the frequent-flier plan with its AAdvantage program in 1981, charges a $50 fee for the transaction. United Airlines charges $75.</p>
        <p>The airlines do not go out of their way to encourage people to collect, either.</p>
        <p>American's program rules, which are mailed twice a year to members, state that miles are not transferable upon death. The rules are written that way, said Mark R. Kienzle, a company spokesman, ''because we make the transfer purely as a customer service, not because it's something we have to do.'' (Miles in most airline programs  expire automatically if there is no account activity in three years.)</p>
        <p>Lawyers, though, acknowledge that there is a downside to addressing frequent-flier miles in a will: If they are valued in an estate inventory, they may be subject to inheritance taxes.</p>
