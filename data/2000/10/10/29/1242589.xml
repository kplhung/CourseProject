        <p>GJERTRUD SCHNACKENBERG stands out among younger American poets for her ambition, in the best sense of the word. Her verse is strong, dense and musical, anchored in the pentameter even when it veers into irregularity; behind it are formidable masters, Robert Lowell most notably, but also Yeats and Auden. Lowellian, too, is her desire to treat history as something more than a stage setting, to make it the medium of thought and feeling. Her new book, ''The Throne of Labdacus,'' is a long meditation on ancient Greece and the Oedipus myth; in her earlier work, collected in ''Supernatural Love,'' she is drawn to Chopin's Paris and colonial New England. These are the tokens of a serious poet, eager to carry on the central tradition of English poetry.</p>
        <p>In her earliest poems, which appeared in ''Portraits and Elegies'' (1982), the echoes of Lowell are often too distinct. His overpacked, muscular line lies behind many of Schnackenberg's: ''Built for his lit-up French rococo coach''; ''The hundred-year-old pear tree's buds explode.'' But she is also able to assimilate that strong current, to temper it with a Frostian simplicity, as in ''The Paperweight,'' where figures in a snow globe become metaphysical emblems:</p>
        <p>We look at them just as the winter night</p>
        <p>With its vast empty spaces bends to see</p>
        <p>Our isolated little world of light,</p>
        <p>Covered with snow, and snow in clouds above it,</p>
        <p>And drifts and swirls too deep to understand.</p>
        <p>Still, I must try to think a little of it,</p>
        <p>With so much winter in my head and hand.</p>
        <p>The idea that we may be watched as we watch the snow globe is fanciful, and Schnackenberg handles it lightly. But it has wide implications for her approach to poetry and history. Typically she views her subject from a height, panoramically: running through 200 years of New England history in ''19 Hadley Street,'' or the coming of Nazism in ''Bavaria'':</p>
        <p>You say, Time will be fair; but I see how</p>
        <p>The West gathers, how all the diseased West</p>
        <p>Could crush you, like a pressure in the chest</p>
        <p>Building, decade by decade, toward Dachau.</p>
        <p>As this passage suggests, the risk of Schnackenberg's elevation is that it can reduce history to a pantomime of abstractions.</p>
        <p>At the same time, however, her angle of vision can give Schnackenberg's poetry a delightful strangeness. One of her best poems, possibly her very best, is another series of tableaux vivants, ''Imaginary Prisons,'' from her second book, ''The Lamplit Answer'' (1985). It is a fantasia on the tale of Sleeping Beauty, proceeding through the enchanted castle to describe each of its inhabitants, frozen in time. And the poem ends, again, by turning the story into a metaphysical parable:</p>
        <p>Say what you wish about the past and future,</p>
        <p>But we have learned that here and now is where</p>
        <p>All time stops in a face we've held as dear</p>
        <p>As she is held who's overcome with roses,</p>
        <p>And now is never where the promised fires</p>
        <p>Are burning, but the time that's set apart</p>
        <p>For you and I to stand and sightless stare.</p>
        <p>This sense that we are caught, lifelong, in an eventless ''here and now'' -- that our existence is merely the working out of things long ago decided, a pure process -- returns in ''The Throne of Labdacus.'' Here, as in her previous book ''A Gilded Lapse of Time'' (1992), the language is less concrete, less rhythmical and musical than in her earlier work, sacrificing pressure for speed. As a result, the interest of the poem lies more than ever in her perspective: not just men but the gods themselves are seen as from far above.</p>
        <p>The god too has a fate.</p>
        <p>The god too would intervene</p>
        <p>Too late, too late -</p>
        <p>The god of healing is helpless before these things.</p>
        <p>The poem is not a retelling of the Oedipus legend but a meditation on it, and assumes a fair familiarity with the original. The myth is most often treated as a lesson in man's utter subjection to fate, but Schnackenberg is more interested in the helplessness of Apollo, who does not really determine the action but simply transmits the decrees of fate. No less than Oedipus, Apollo is condemned to playing his part in the tragedy:</p>
        <p>The god frightened</p>
        <p>By the self-blinding -- and a story,</p>
        <p>The meaning of which nobody knows,</p>
        <p>Or whose meaning is that nobody knows,</p>
        <p>Fate, she suggests, makes time irrelevant, since the consequences of any event are wholly determined in advance -- time is merely the dimension of their unfolding, and not an open region for choice and action. It is a truly metaphysical idea, and over the course of the poem Schnackenberg elaborates it so that it can strike the reader with something like its genuine strangeness.</p>
        <p>This is a very rare achievement in contemporary poetry -- a philosophical idea treated, not glibly, obscurely or melodramatically, but with due seriousness and real intelligence. In each of her books so far, Schnackenberg is reaching towards a more comprehensive work of art, attempting to balance language and idea, grandeur and precision. If one feels that ''The Throne of Labdacus'' is not yet that perfect balance, it is only because even more satisfying and impressive poems will surely follow it.</p>
