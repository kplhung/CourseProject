        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am disappointed that one of your reviewers -- once again -- has taken upon himself the noble task of reminding readers that they cannot possibly ''care'' about characters who are capable of making them laugh. I am referring to Albert Mobilio's review of T. C. Boyle's novel ''A Friend of the Earth'' (Oct. 8), in which he says, ''This kind of self-reflexive wisecracking provides a tonic jolt in some novels, but in a story this thin it only reminds us how little we care, how slight the tether is to any larger drama.'' I care deeply about the members of my family, but their antics often send me into hilarity, in spite of the ''larger drama.''</p>
        <p>Spare me the weighty values that seem to inform many of your reviewers' sensibilities. Comedy, parody, satire are worthy vehicles in which to dissect human foibles and tribulations.</p>
