        <p>Welcome Not Universal, But Neighbors Adjust</p>
        <p>There was not only jubilation but concern eight months ago, when the sleek, glass-and-aluminum, $210 million Rose Center for Earth and Space opened its doors at 81st Street and Central Park West.</p>
        <p>The American Museum of Natural History saw its new planetarium, which had its debut on Feb. 19, as a symbol of the institution's rebirth and a magnet for a projected one million extra visitors a year.</p>
        <p>But some nearby residents worried that a flood of visitors to the Rose Center would be a neighborhood killer. And an Oregon Indian tribal group demanded the return of the building's centerpiece -- the 15.5-ton Willamette Meteorite, bought in 1906 -- saying it was a sacred tribal object.</p>
        <p>In a settlement reached in June with the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, the museum permitted the tribal group to make ceremonial visits to the meteorite and agreed to install a plaque explaining its sacred meaning.</p>
        <p>Richard Lieb, a member of the board of the Beresford, an apartment building on West 81st Street, said the opening of the planetarium ''hasn't been the end of the world, but noise and crowding have increased.'' Traffic congestion is such that ''crossing 81st Street on Central Park West is increasingly difficult,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Visiting school buses ''create enormous air pollution -- idling and cruising around the neighborhood,'' said Samuel H. Leff, president of the Community Alliance for Responsible Museum Development. He said he had to install new windows ''to keep out the noise and the pollution.''</p>
        <p>To date, more than 2.5 million people have visited the Rose Center, far exceeding the museum's expectations, said Gary Zarr, the museum's senior vice president for communications. ''We think the Rose Center has been overwhelmingly well received around the world and by the community as well.''</p>
        <p>Queens Hopes to Regain A Reminder of Its Past</p>
        <p>It had been 24 years since the New York State Archives last permitted the Flushing Remonstrance to be on display in Flushing, Queens. And so, in January, when it was time for the latest exhibition to end and the 342-year-old document to be returned from the Flushing Public Library to a closed vault in Albany, the borough's elected representatives, civic officials and historians objected loudly to giving it back.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the priceless, fire-damaged Remonstrance was escorted back to Albany by state troopers.</p>
        <p>The plea for religious tolerance -- written on rag paper and signed on Dec. 27, 1657, by 30 farmers in Flushing -- was presented to Peter Stuyvesant in an ultimately successful protest. Some scholars believe the document to be a forerunner of the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>Right now the Remonstrance, legally the property of the State of New York, is in a laboratory in Philadelphia, where it was delivered six weeks ago to repair damage from moisture and from a fire in 1911.</p>
        <p>When the fragile document is returned next year, ''we definitely plan to put it on periodic display'' in Queens and elsewhere, said V. Chapman-Smith, the New York State archivist. But it will be lent only in accordance with the conservators' recommendations. ''There are rigid security and conservation requirements for display, and the Queens people need to submit a proposal to us,'' Ms. Chapman-Smith said.  ''The best reason for moving it to Flushing is its very name,'' said David Oats, the editor of The Queens Courier, a weekly newspaper, who has led efforts to keep the Remonstrance in Queens. ''We are hoping to have a proposal for a permanent location by the end of the year.''</p>
