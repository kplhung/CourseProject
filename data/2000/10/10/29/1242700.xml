        <p>LIKE many young actors new to New York, Jeannie Dalton got a place in Brooklyn, took a day job in Midtown Manhattan and started going to auditions.</p>
        <p>There was only one problem. The commute to Kensington, a Brooklyn neighborhood just past Park Slope, took an hour each way. By the time she got home to the two-bedroom apartment she shared first with a friend and then with her sister, she was exhausted and didn't want to go out again.</p>

        <p>LIKE many young actors new to New York, Jeannie Dalton got a place in Brooklyn, took a day job in Midtown Manhattan and started going to auditions.</p>
        <p>There was only one problem. The commute to Kensington, a Brooklyn neighborhood just past Park Slope, took an hour each way. By the time she got home to the two-bedroom apartment she shared first with a friend and then with her sister, she was exhausted and didn't want to go out again.</p>
        <p>''I never got used to it,'' Ms. Dalton said. ''The trains would put me to sleep. I'd get home and I couldn't keep my eyes open.'' She may have been living in New York, but she was very, very far away from the theaters.</p>
        <p>So, on Aug. 1, Ms. Dalton, who grew up in a military family and seems to have acquired the flexibility that constant moves require, settled into a minuscule studio apartment at the Times Square Hotel, a residence at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue. Run by the Common Ground Community, a nonprofit organization, it is known largely as a place for formerly homeless people with psychological and drug problems, or with AIDS.</p>
        <p>But half its residents are people like Ms. Dalton, many of them also actors and musicians, who simply meet its requirement that annual income not exceed $28,500. Ms. Dalton, who paid $650 for her share in Brooklyn, pays $500 near Times Square, including utilities.</p>
        <p>Sitting with her dog, a Pembroke Welsh corgi named Titian, on a quilt-covered bed filled with pillows, Ms. Dalton, with her long wavy gold hair, looked like a college student in a nice dorm room. She has used every inch of space for her possessions.</p>
        <p>On one shelf is a Madame Alexander doll she saved from her childhood and used as a prop for her nonspeaking part in the movie ''Girl, Interrupted.'' On the wall behind her bed are framed fabric collages that her mother sewed when the family lived in Japan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dalton, who received a bachelor of fine arts degree from the University of Colorado, can now walk to her job as a secretary at Sonnenblick-Goldman, a commercial real estate investment banking company. Living near Times Square, she said, makes it much easier to combine her day job with acting. She is currently performing in ''The Line of Least Existence,'' a play by Rosalyn Drexler at the Medicine Show theater on West 52nd Street.</p>
        <p>''I play a 13-year-old runaway who gets involved in all this bad stuff in the 60's,'' she said. ''It's been so interesting, learning all this stuff.''</p>
        <p>When she was asked whether her parents were involved in all the upheaval of the 60's, she just laughed and laughed. ''Oh my, no,'' she said. ''They said, 'If you ever do anything like that, we're throwing you out.' '' Her father, a Marine pilot, was killed flying his plane during maneuvers when she was 13; her mother, a nurse, married another Marine pilot. Her mother died five years ago.</p>
        <p>MS. Dalton, who lived in Brooklyn for only a year, found her new place when she was walking down 43rd Street and noticed a sign on the building that it was for affordable living. She telephoned, received an application and filled it out. She was called in first for one interview, then another.</p>
        <p>''They asked me if I could deal with the people who live here, people who have AIDS, people who are not mentally stable,'' she said. ''I said, 'I don't think I would have a problem with it.' '' When she was told a few months later that a room was available, the time was right. Her sister had decided to leave New York, and from prior experience, Ms. Dalton knew how hard it would be to find a place in Manhattan that was affordable and allowed dogs.</p>
        <p>The Common Ground Community offers counseling, an exercise room, a thrift store, a rehearsal space for acting classes, and even brunch on the balcony of the grand, high-ceilinged lobby. She doesn't use many of the services because she is out so much, but she doesn't appear to find it uncomfortable living in a building where some of the tenants talk to themselves, or speak too loudly, or in some way don't quite fit most people's idea of normal. ''It's been very interesting as an actor to see all these different people,'' she said, although sometimes ''it's a little sad.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone is so comfortable. In the elevator, another tenant spontaneously offered the information that she can't wait to move out, because her neighbor plays music loudly all the time. Ms. Dalton just smiled. In fact, her room is suffused with a loud hum from a generator in a nearby building that could drive someone else to the brink. She says she has gotten used to it, and is happy to have three windows.</p>
        <p>The small kitchen, with a single unit that includes two burners, a half  refrigerator and a sink, allows her to make things like grilled cheese sandwiches. Dinner parties are out, although she is thinking of putting in a loft bed and moving some furniture underneath so she can bring in a drop-leaf table. Right now, she has to eat her meals on the bed.</p>
        <p>She admits to feeling crowded in the space, and figures she won't stay more than two years. Being a pack rat doesn't help. ''I keep rearranging it,'' she said. ''I say to myself, 'There's got to be more room.''</p>
