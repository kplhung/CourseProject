        <p>Car owners in the West Village say they are being shortchanged by plans to convert acres of affordable parking at Pier 40 into acres of open park.</p>
        <p>For 26 years, more than 2,000 residents have parked their cars at Pier 40, a former passenger ship terminal on the Hudson River near Houston Street. But plans are under way to convert at least half of the sprawling 15-acre site -- about the size of Lincoln Center -- into parkland.</p>

        <p>Car owners in the West Village say they are being shortchanged by plans to convert acres of affordable parking at Pier 40 into acres of open park.</p>
        <p>For 26 years, more than 2,000 residents have parked their cars at Pier 40, a former passenger ship terminal on the Hudson River near Houston Street. But plans are under way to convert at least half of the sprawling 15-acre site -- about the size of Lincoln Center -- into parkland.</p>
        <p>''If they remove the parking from the pier, most of us could not possibly afford to park anywhere else,'' said Larry Early, who lives on West 11th Street and pays about $182 a month for a space for his minivan. The displaced cars, he added, ''would be back on the streets, taking up space and creating emissions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Early recently founded a group, Parks and Parkers Alliance, to rally fellow car owners.</p>
        <p>The Hudson River Park Trust, which oversees the state-owned pier, has yet to issue final plans. But a proposal developed by Pier, Park and Playground, a nonprofit community group, calls for several acres of open parkland and an outdoor playground to replace a rooftop garage, and would restrict parking to automated stacking structures that would cost nearly $10,000 a space.</p>
        <p>Community Board 2 and the citizens' advisory council to the trust have approved the plan.</p>
        <p>But Ben Korman, a partner in Pier 40 Operating L.L.C., which pays the state $4.15 million a year to lease the pier, said such a system would be too costly and would increase parking fees sharply.</p>
        <p>City Councilwoman Christine Quinn added: ''The scarcity of affordable parking is second only to affordable housing. If we try to get open space by clogging our street, we cut off our nose to spite our face.''</p>
