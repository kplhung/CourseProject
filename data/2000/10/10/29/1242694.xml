        <p>IF my grandmother were still alive, she would be mystified as to why anyone would care about a World Series between two teams from New York.</p>
        <p>That's because she grew up in East Windsor, a part of the state that does not cheer for the Yankees or Mets, but weeps for the Red Sox. Later, she had an apartment in Plainville, which lies close to the Yankees-Red Sox fault line, and in the apartment was a television set, and on that set was a statue, right where a Catholic might have a statue of the Virgin, where a Hindu might have Krishna, where a Buddhist might have Buddha.</p>

        <p>IF my grandmother were still alive, she would be mystified as to why anyone would care about a World Series between two teams from New York.</p>
        <p>That's because she grew up in East Windsor, a part of the state that does not cheer for the Yankees or Mets, but weeps for the Red Sox. Later, she had an apartment in Plainville, which lies close to the Yankees-Red Sox fault line, and in the apartment was a television set, and on that set was a statue, right where a Catholic might have a statue of the Virgin, where a Hindu might have Krishna, where a Buddhist might have Buddha.</p>
        <p>The statue was of Ted Williams, the tormented, Promethean Red Sox slugger. My grandmother worked in central Connecticut factories and took a ton of guff from the Yankee crowd with their Ruth and DiMaggio and Mantle and their sybaritic lolling, like overfed pashas, in pennants and World Series victories.</p>
        <p>She didn't care. She thought the Yankees were corrupt. The idea that they might be in league with the devil seemed to her more like the literal truth than the premise for a Broadway musical.</p>
        <p>That's how it is here in Connecticut. We take the New York vs. Boston thing pretty seriously. Armies of Darkness vs. Armies of Light. Connecticut is contested territory, Alsace-Lorraine, the DMZ, the Shire, with part of the state allied with the superpower to the west, the other to the north.</p>
        <p>If you're a Hobbit living in the Shire or a shepherd tending flocks in Alsace-Lorraine, do you really care whether a couple of factions within one of the superpowers are having at each other? My grandmother wouldn't have, and there are plenty of state residents who felt the same last week, especially in the part of Connecticut that is Red Sox territory. Our idea of a subway series is one where a train from Boston's T drives straight at, say, the Lexington Avenue 6 train. You blink, you lose.</p>
        <p>In his 1992 documentary, ''Between Boston and New York,'' the Connecticut film-maker Ken Simon used the barroom sniping of Yankee and Red Sox partisans to illustrate the state's generally unsettled character.</p>
        <p>''We dealt with a lot of other differences in that documentary that were maybe more cerebral or subtle,'' he said. ''We certainly never talked about anything that elicited the kind of passion that baseball did. Of course, we were in a bar.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon says he remembers vividly his first trip as a boy to Yankee Stadium, just as I remember by first trip to Fenway Park. Like baby ducks who ''imprint'' and follow the first potential parent they see, Connecticut kids bond at an early age with their stadiums.</p>
        <p>The trash talk transpiring this month in Manhattan offices and Yonkers saloons is old hat to us. We've all been through so many appellate pleadings of Williams v. DiMaggio, Nomar v. Derek, Yaz. v. Mickey, that we kind of argue by rote, if at all. What does it mean for a state to be so deeply divided?</p>
        <p>First, understand that baseball is not the first thing to divide us.</p>
        <p>If you were to draw a line attempting to demarcate the territory thickest with Yankee sympathizers from that thickest with Red Sox fans, making ample allowances for infiltration, you would start a little east of New Haven (a Yankees town) and kind of slant north and east toward the Connecticut River. Things get a little muddy around Middletown. Just south of there is East Haddam, home of the ''Moodus noises,'' persistent rumbling groans allegedly associated with tectonic shifting, but perhaps actually caused by highly focused Yankee and Red Sox energies grinding against one another at a major stress point.</p>
        <p>The line would then have to bow out to the west, in a parabola that scooped Bristol and New Britain into Red Soxica, and then slashed back toward Hartford. North of the river, Red Sox territory would again expand westward just a little.</p>
        <p>Now, I'm no historian, but that line is pretty darn close to the line separating the area of Tory sympathy from Connecticut hotbeds of revolution in the second half of the 18th century, with -- and I'm not making any value judgments here -- the Yankee territory supporting the Crown and the Red Sox country supporting the insurrection. There's an old Tory cave in the woods near the Burlington-Bristol line, just to give you a sense of where the rubbing points were. You'd have to make some adjustments, especially with New Haven, but you'd be on course, most of the time.</p>
        <p>The Boston-New York split also tracks certain religious differences. As any pollster in 1774 could tell you, Congregationalists tended to support the revolution and Anglicans tended to be Loyalists. And indeed, Red Sox partisanship is a much easier fit with the Calvinism that begot the early Congregationalists. John Calvin and his heirs (think Thomas Hooker, Cotton Mather and my grandmother, Alma Cotton) believed chances for atonement and salvation were limited, regarded humans as pretty much helpless to do anything about it. Sound like a typical season at Fenway?</p>
        <p>And then consider the Anglicans (or Episcopalians) who vest authority in their bishops. Isn't there something vaguely episcopal about the Yankees? There's an apostolic succession, Ruth to Gehrig to DiMaggio to Mantle. Then consider the Anglicans (sometimes grudging) loyalty  to a King George who impoverished the treasury to pay for his wars. I have one word for you: Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>Significantly, nobody in Connecticut seems to know what to do with Mets fans, although the president of the University of Hartford, Walter Harrison, who has written and lectured extensively on baseball, offers the intriguing observation that they almost seem to be a fusion of pinstripes and crimson hose.</p>
        <p>Boston fans, he says, ''tend to be almost Job-like in their suffering.'' Mets fans have suffered, but not quite as much, and they know what it's like to win a world championship, says Mr. Harrison, which gives them a little bit of swagger in kinship with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Could Mets fans in Connecticut possess a kind of hybrid vigor, Redsoxy enough to steel themselves against frequent disappointment but sufficiently New York-inflected to appreciate the fruits of success without the imperial, some might say arrogant, qualities of actual Yankee fans?</p>
        <p>The species is, at present, too young. More study is needed.</p>
