        <p>ALTHOUGH the the first building at the 33-acre Reckson Executive Park under construction along the Long Island Expressway just west of Route 110 in Melville will have its official opening in December, no tenants have yet signed leases for its 277,000 square feet of space.</p>
        <p>But Mitchell Rechler, the co-chief operating officer of the publicly held Reckson Associates Realty Corporation in Melville, the developer of the 554,162-square-foot project, which ultimately will have twin buildings, did not sound worried.</p>
        <p>''This is not a disappointment,'' he said.  ''We normally anticipate not signing leases  before a building is completed because historically on Long Island space is not leased until people can see a finished product. This has nothing to do with the market.''</p>
        <p>At a time when financial markets are swinging and some companies are reporting disappointing earnings, substantial new space is flowing into the Long Island office market.</p>
        <p>In addition to Reckson Executive Park, Reckson has 170,000 square feet available at the Melville Technology Center at 50 Marcus Drive in Melville. The project, which is a renovation of an industrial building to Class A offices --that is, well located office space with quality amenities -- opened earlier this month. Several brokers hinted that a major high-technology company was interested in taking the entire building, but no lease has yet been signed.</p>
        <p>The Tritec Real Estate Company of East Setauket, in partnership with Greenfield Partners of Westport, Conn., held a ground-breaking earlier this month of the first phase of a 408,000-square-foot complex, 100 Motor Parkway, to be built on 20 acres at Exit 53 of the Long Island Expressway in Hauppauge. The building will have 170,000 square feet of offices and 60,000 square feet of meeting rooms and other tenant amenities.</p>
        <p>Several major conversions of other industrial buildings to Class A space are also under way in the Route 110 corridor.</p>
        <p>Long Island's diverse economy, its concentration of high-tech companies and its low vacancy rates are expected to keep the office market stable.</p>
        <p>Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Commack-based Long Island Association, a leading regional business group, said that she saw ''some risk in all this space coming on line in a short period of time,'' but that on the plus side Long Island has seen very little new office construction in the last decade because of the reluctance of banks to lend.  ''So this doesn't mean the new space won't be absorbed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''The economy is topping out and poised for slower growth ahead and that is what the stock market is telling us,'' she said. ''But even if we have a recession -- and it is not clear that we will -- Long Island has a base of technology that will act as a buffer. Those technologies are needed in bad times as well as in good times.''</p>
        <p>The companies include Computer Associates International of Islandia, a designer and developer of computer software products, with 21,000 employees; the Cablevision Systems Corporation of Bethpage, one of the nation's leading telecommunications and entertainment companies, with almost 14,000 employees; Arrow Electronics of Melville, a distributor of electronic components and computer products to industrial and commercial customers, with more than 11,200 employees: and Symbol Technologies, a world leader in portable data terminals and bar code scanners, with almost 4,000 employees.</p>
        <p>''These are companies that are somewhat insulated from what's happening in the stock market because they are in large markets, with extensive customer bases and evolving new products for customers that rely on them,'' said Gus P. Nuzzolese, a senior managing director at Sutton &amp; Edwards, a Lake Success brokerage.</p>
        <p>Most brokers agree with Raymond A. Ruiz, a vice president at the Garden City office of CB Richard Ellis, the international brokerage, that the influx of new space will, in fact, have a positive effect on the office market. ''New construction and redevelopment projects are bringing equilibrium back to a marketplace where tenants were having a very difficult time securing space and landlords were having an equally difficult time trying to accommodate them, especially their existing tenants,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not counting the new buildings coming on line, vacancies for Class A buildings in both Nassau and Suffolk Counties are at historic lows. Corporate mergers among large financial institutions could have left large blocks of space in existing buildings lingering on the market, but companies whose businesses were growing rushed to fill it, resulting in a 350,000-square-foot net absorption in this year's first nine months. In the same period last year, the net absorption was 307,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>''Chase Manhattan Bank left 700,000 square feet and a couple of thousand jobs behind in Jericho,'' said Paul F. Amoruso, managing partner of Oxford &amp; Simpson, commercial brokers in Jericho. ''But before the lights were out, Cablevision occupied both buildings.''</p>
        <p>THE commercial brokerage firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Long Island, which is based in Melville, reported that in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the direct office vacancy rate -- space available directly from landlords and not including subleases -- was 4.4 percent, the second lowest on record and only slightly higher than the 4.1 percent low reached the year before. The vacancy rate including sublease space stood at 5.9 percent. Annual direct asking rents at the end of the third quarter had risen to $28.88 per square foot from $28.01 per square foot a year earlier. Long Island has 12.8 million square feet of Class A office space, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
        <p>''The slowing economy is going to affect everyone, but the good news is we don't have a tremendous amount of space,'' said Kenneth M. Krasnow, regional managing director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield's Long Island division, which also encompasses Connecticut. ''We don't see companies saying, 'Well, maybe we don't need more space.' They are still thinking about where to go because of the growth of their business.''</p>
        <p>An internal study recently conducted by Insignia/ESG, an international brokerage that has a Syosset office, showed that there was enough demand and anticipated demand based on planned expansions to fill double the space now on the market, said Martin L. Lomazow, a senior managing director at the brokerage company, which is handling the leasing at the Tritec building.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, space at Nassau's first speculative office building in a decade was readily absorbed. When the Tilles Companies of Woodbury completed its 100,000-square-foot 88 Froelich Farm Boulevard building in February, it had no signed leases. But now all but 8,000 square feet are rented ''and we have someone about to sign a lease on it,'' said Roger Tilles, a principal of the company with his brother, Peter.</p>
        <p>Over all, the company, which owns three million square feet of office space on Long Island, only has 25,000 square feet vacant, for which it is talking with users wanting 200,000 square feet, Mr. Tilles said. ''So we have eight times the amount of users than we have space,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, a 525,000-square-foot office park in Melville just west of the intersection of the Long Island Expressway and Route 110 for which the Tilles Companies has approvals will not be started until leases for most of the space are signed, Mr. Tilles said. ''I would do 100,000 square feet on spec today, but not 525,000 square feet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Reckson Executive Park and 100 Motor Parkway both occupy highly visible sites along the Long Island Expressway. The Reckson building, four stories high, was designed internally by the company's architectural staff. The Tritec building is six stories high, making it one of the tallest in Suffolk. The architects are Mojo Stumer Architects of Roslyn and the Baldassano Architectural Group of Ronkonkoma.</p>
        <p>Both buildings are designed with sophisticated technology and backup systems, and  both represent the new direction Suffolk is taking in bringing high-quality office space in very large complexes far east of the traditional office hubs of Lake Success, Mitchel Field and Jericho.</p>
        <p>Rents in the two buildings are also breaking new ground for Hauppauge and Melville, with asking rents at 100 Motor Parkway scheduled to go from $26 to $27.50 a square foot by the end of the year, and asking rents at the Reckson building at $32 a square foot. Those prices do not include electricity costs of $2.25 a square foot. The average rent for Class A space in the Hauppauge area, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, is $25.32 a square foot, including electric, and in Melville it is $28.50 a square foot with electricity.</p>
        <p>If anything, the softening market could bring downward pressure on rents but not a  downturn in demand, said Mr. Krasnow, the regional manager of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. ''The envelope will not continue to be pushed in terms of escalating prices,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, brokers say, for the immediate future it is likely to remain a landlord's market.</p>
        <p>When the economy turned soft in the 1980's, Long Island's office inventory had just undergone an unusual growth spurt, said Bruce Nelson, a vice president of the investment property group at CB Richard Ellis in Garden City. ''What really hurt us was going from 20 million square feet to 35 million square feet mostly between 1984 and 1988, and that kind of increase creates a lot of problems no matter what state the economy is in,'' he said. ''Today, we are looking at a 3 to 5 percent increase, and that's healthy growth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Amoruso of Oxford &amp; Simpson added: ''Financing wasn't available for new construction and that's the real reason we won't have the real estate crisis we had before.''  ''Banks lost so much in the 1980's that they avoided lending, and what has happened is they have managed to save developers from themselves.''</p>
