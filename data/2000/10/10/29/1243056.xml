        <p>Before each team meeting last week, Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops showed his players a highlight reel from past showdowns with Nebraska, specifically snippets from the 12 victories Coach Barry Switzer recorded over the Cornhuskers, a couple of them in come-from-behind fashion. Stoops wanted to educate them in what is known around here as Sooner magic.</p>
        <p>His Sooners apparently paid attention. After spotting Nebraska a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, the Sooners reeled off 31 consecutive points -- 24 in the second quarter -- to earn a 31-14 victory that sent many of the 75,989 at Memorial Stadium tumbling onto the field and a fusillade of oranges streaking through the air.</p>

        <p>Before each team meeting last week, Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops showed his players a highlight reel from past showdowns with Nebraska, specifically snippets from the 12 victories Coach Barry Switzer recorded over the Cornhuskers, a couple of them in come-from-behind fashion. Stoops wanted to educate them in what is known around here as Sooner magic.</p>
        <p>His Sooners apparently paid attention. After spotting Nebraska a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, the Sooners reeled off 31 consecutive points -- 24 in the second quarter -- to earn a 31-14 victory that sent many of the 75,989 at Memorial Stadium tumbling onto the field and a fusillade of oranges streaking through the air.</p>
        <p>Not only was the magic back, but their beloved Sooners were also poised to move into first place in the Bowl Championship Series standing and perhaps return to the Orange Bowl for a national title game. That is something the Oklahoma faithful had not been able to look forward to since 1988, when the Sooners faced Miami for the title.</p>
        <p>Oklahoma (7-0, 4-0 in the Big 12) is No. 1 in the New York Times computer ranking and No. 3 in the Associated Press poll and the B.C.S. standing. Nebraska (7-1, 4-1) is No. 1 in the A.P. poll and in the B.C.S. standing and No. 4 in the Times ranking.</p>
        <p>''It's a good feeling to know who we are, and we're a decent football team,'' Stoops said. ''But our goal wasn't to be No. 1 in the middle of the season. It's to be No. 1 when it's all over.''</p>
        <p>This rebirth of Oklahoma football became official in the second quarter, when the Sooners put up some startling numbers. The first surprise was the 24 points on four straight possessions, which at least could be explained. The Sooners have the nation's top scoring offense, and quarterback Josh Heupel is a leading Heisman Trophy candidate.</p>
        <p>The second statistic was unimaginable. Against the Nebraska offense, which was second in the nation in scoring and averaged 499 yards a game, Oklahoma held the Cornhuskers to 16 yards of total offense and a single first down in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>This was the same defensive bunch that, in the first quarter, had given up 192 yards and 2 touchdowns on Nebraska's first two possessions. Stoops's brother, Mike, the co-defensive coordinator, told his players on the sideline: ''We're better than this. You guys can't play on emotion. You've got to follow your assignments and make the tackles or we're going to get killed out here.''</p>
        <p>The Sooners' quick-strike offense, meanwhile, needed a bruising quarter to figure out how to sidestep Nebraska's blitzes, but once Heupel decided to drift from the pocket, he began picking apart the secondary.</p>
        <p>Heupel throws lobs that more often than not look as if they will be intercepted. But with 7-of-10 passing in the second quarter, his rainbows dropped into teammates' hands for 149 yards. His 19-yard pass to Curtis Fagan set up Oklahoma's first score, a 1-yard run by Quentin Griffin. On the next possession, Heupel returned to Fagan for a fade pattern and a 34-yard touchdown. The Sooners blocked a punt to set up a 19-yard field goal by Tim Duncan to gain the lead, 17-14, and the defense once more held Nebraska to three plays and a punt. This time Heupel needed only four plays, three passes, to put the Sooners on the board again. He set up an 8-yard sweep by Josh Norman by avoiding a blitz and passing 37 yards to Antwone Savage.</p>
        <p>''What our defense did was huge; it changed the course of the game,'' Heupel said. ''If they don't keep the offense off the field, we can't do what we do.''</p>
        <p>The Sooners' defense so rattled Nebraska that the Cornhuskers were desperate to make something happen as they opened the second half. But Sooners middle linebacker Torrance Marshall dropped Eric Crouch for back-to-back sacks, and the Cornhuskers faced third-and-27 on their 23-yard line.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter, Crouch had completed his first five passes, including a 39-yard touchdown to Matt Davison, and turned an option keeper into a 37-yard touchdown. Now he was frustrated. Crouch locked in on Bobby Newcombe cutting toward the sideline, but he did not see defensive back Derrick Strait, whom Davison had beaten on the touchdown. Strait intercepted the pass at the Nebraska 32 and ran to the end zone for a 31-14 lead.</p>
        <p>''He threw it straight to me,'' said Strait, who also forced a fumble in the fourth quarter to end a Nebraska drive at the Sooners' 20. ''I saw a lane to the corner and got it into the end zone. I owed my team one.''</p>
        <p>Nebraska might have another shot at Oklahoma in the Big 12 championship game if it wins the North Division and Oklahoma captures the South.</p>
        <p>That possibility was little solace this afternoon. ''How we rebound from this is going to be a challenge,'' said Crouch, who ran for 103 yards and was 12 of 25 passing for 133 yards.</p>
        <p>Now that Oklahoma players have had a taste of Sooner magic, they would like to conjure more. ''Everybody just wants to play the No. 1 team and win,'' Strait said. ''We have the 'S' on our chest and everyone wants to come knock it off.''</p>
