        <p>LITTLE in life is more exasperating than sitting in traffic, beginning and ending each workday with a frustrating crawl. It's expensive, too, costing billions a year in lost productivity. Nassau and Suffolk employers regularly rate transportation delays as one of the big problems of doing business on Long Island, and employees tend to feel likewise.</p>
        <p>Dr. Clifford R. Bragdon, the director of the National Aviation and Transportation Center at the Dowling College branch at Brookhaven Airport, is an authority on making cities more livable and easier to navigate, what he calls ''holistic transportation planning.'' The NAT Center, as it's known, specializes in the emerging field of time-sensitive transportation simulation: software programs and computer displays developed by Dr. Bragdon at the center allow planners to see exactly how proposed changes in everything from roads and bridges to air and rail schedules affect usage moment by moment. Extending a high-occupancy vehicle lane might speed up rush-hour traffic, for example. A proposed shopping mall might produce gridlock on a local Main Street.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bragdon foresees the simulation technology as an agent for consensus-building, and therefore better planning.</p>
        <p>''Instead of getting angry whenever change is proposed, simulation allows people to see exactly how the change -- a new building, for example, or roadway construction -- will affect their community at different times of the day or night, and different times of the year,'' Dr. Bragdon said. ''It puts more science into planning. It takes time into account, so it becomes four-dimensional.''</p>
        <p>The NAT Center's client list is global, extending from Suffolk County and Palm Beach (Fla.) International Airport to NATO and the International Olympic Committee. Recently, Dr. Bragdon concluded the first phase of a three-part consulting study on solving the congestion problems on Route 110, which parallels the Nassau-Suffolk border.</p>
        <p>Often described as a Renaissance man by colleagues, Dr. Bragdon, 60, a native of St. Louis, has taught such subjects as architecture, public health, airport management and historic preservation at universities and seminars around the country. He came to the NAT Center in 1992 and since then has helped develop magnetic levitation technology for high-speed rail transport. His ever-growing collection of vintage model planes now dangle from the ceilings of the center's three buildings.</p>
        <p>''He was the Thomas Jefferson of Georgia Tech,'' said Paul Muldawer, an Atlanta architect and a colleague during Dr. Bragdon's two decades on the faculty of the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>One recent afternoon, Dr. Bragdon took a reporter on what he called a ''visioneering transportation survey'' of the area surrounding the NAT Center. Could Dr. Bragdon make sense out of Long Island's notorious transportation problems?</p>
        <p>As Dr. Bragdon twisted his key in the ignition of his white '98 Chrysler Concorde, he said: ''There are over 200 authorities on Long Island that make decisions impacting transportation. Furthermore, land-use decisions are separated from transportation decisions. Consensus is awfully difficult to achieve.''</p>
        <p>That said, we were off. Heading toward William Floyd Parkway, we pass a dormitory; Dr. Bragdon waxes enthusiastic over the mixed-use principle. A major cause of sprawl, he contends, is the practice of segregating buildings according to use: malls for shopping, office complexes for working, schools for studying, a practice that forces people into cars.</p>
        <p>''Everything we build ought to have more than one use,'' he said, recalling a recent conversation he had with Robert Gaffney, the Suffolk County executive. ''I told him we have got to ban single-use development altogether. He agreed with me. He said he'll propose it after the next election.'' Three requests for comment made to Mr. Gaffney's office were unavailing.</p>
        <p>Ten minutes later we are in Shirley, driving through a residential neighborhood. We stop outside a metal tower, staring at a series of ''danger'' signs. Dr. Bragdon gestures at the tower. ''Talk about single use!'' he said. ''And it's so forbidding, you're afraid to walk near it. You'll be zapped! It's just for microwave transmission. Not a smart use of space. Compare this to the Eiffel Tower, with restaurants and elevators so you can enjoy the view. That's smarter use.''</p>
        <p>Towers take up nearly as much land on Long Island as roads do, by Dr. Bragdon's estimate. ''Not smart use of space,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This phrase was quickly becoming a mantra. ''Smarter use would be to run other lines alongside or underneath,'' he said. ''You can't safely move people, but you could move data or freight. Right now, all that's moving is electricity. And just look at all the space it takes.''</p>
        <p>Next, a short foray on the Long Island Expressway. At Exit 68 near the Brookhaven Airport, he praises the noise barriers but wonders aloud why they were constructed of concrete rather than a more noise-absorbent medium.</p>
        <p>''Smart, not smarter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>We pull into the HOV lane. Dr. Bragdon offers tepid praise to the state for promoting multiple-passenger use. The problem, as he sees it, is that HOV drivers have to cross three lanes when they want to exit. ''You see drivers swerving across traffic for the exits, endangering themselves and everyone else,'' Dr. Bragdon said. ''I don't think it helps people get to work faster. I certainly don't consider this a successful solution. Nor, I think, does almost anyone else.''</p>
        <p>Not smart.</p>
        <p>The trip is taking a little longer than expected. Dr. Bragdon decides to forgo planned visits to Greenport and Riverhead. It's clear he's frustrated by the change of plans. He touts both communities as successful examples of waterfront revitalization, the subject, close to his heart, of one of the four books he's written. Waterfront development offers an alternative to suburban sprawl, in his view.</p>
        <p>Last stop: the bustling Long Island Rail Road station in Ronkonkoma, where acres of parking have been augmented by a looming single-purpose garage. ''Rail is smart,'' he said, ''but again it's single-use. The rails could transport much more than only people, although for the most part, they do not. And all this parking -- cars, cars, cars -- just sitting here, 10 hours a day. There is no complementary usage: the stores here don't really serve the commuter population.</p>
        <p>''I mean, you have to drive miles to get to businesses that serve cars: repair shops, auto body, detailing places. They ought to be here, where cars just sit all day. Instead you have to drive your car to be serviced, then you need another ride to get to the station.''</p>
