        <p>THE Bayview Bistro is not what is used to be. Diners who go to this Northport spot may not realize they are in a new restaurant. The name and decor are the same, but in the last six months everything else has changed: owners, chefs, menu.</p>
        <p>This spot opened in February 1999 as the Soup du Jour Bistro. That unfortunate, misleading name was dropped a few months later.</p>
        <p>The restaurant today looks much as it did then. The new owners wisely didn't tamper with the nostalgic decor. The atmosphere evokes Belle Epoque Paris. There is a marble bar, warm wainscotted wood walls, a pressed-tin ceiling and beveled-glass faux windows. Tables are topped with cloths covered with white butcher paper and adorned with fresh flowers and small, flickering lanterns.</p>
        <p>This is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde kind of place. On a crowded Saturday the noise level was shattering, the service sloppy and the food uneven.  On a quiet Tuesday, the restaurant was completely transformed. Our smiling waitress was on top of the situation, knew who had ordered each dish and did a good job of meeting our needs. The place was quiet enough for conversation, and the kitchen improved when the pressure was off.</p>
        <p>It's hard to know if the culinary successes and failures were the results of the night visited or the talents of the chef. Generally, main courses were more on target than appetizers. Two fish selections got high marks: Chilean sea bass with a citrus-anise glaze paired with coconut jasmine sticky rice, and a special of miso-glazed salmon atop a mound of addictive wasabi mashed potatoes. Sesame-seed-crusted tuna, though, was overcooked and dry.</p>
        <p>The pound-and-a-half lobster was as sweet as they come, but its bready crab meat stuffing was superfluous.  A rose-petal-shaped pasta of the day in a pink vodka sauce was brimming with firm jumbo shrimp and sweet sea scallops.</p>
        <p>Steak is the meat to order. The prime, dry-aged porterhouse for two made a good showing, as did an evening special of steak au poivre in a brandy cream sauce with asparagus and onion rings. The apricot-glazed pork tenderloin served with roasted Yukon gold potatoes also won praise. But the roasted Long Island duck breast was fatty and run--of-the-mill. Ordinary, too, were the mustard-crusted rack of lamb and the slightly dry chicken breast crusted with laced potato.</p>
        <p>We tried two soups: a thin, watery onion with a thick cheese lid and a spunky corn-crab chowder. The kick in the latter was unexpected, though.  Our waitress never used the word ''spicy'' when describing it. Beef sate was another surprise. Hoisin, instead of the traditional peanut dipping sauce, is served. Surprises aside, it passed muster because of its tender meat.</p>
        <p>Another Asian winner is the pork and corn steamed dumplings arranged around a green salad laced with pineapple and napped with a soy fresh mint jade sauce.</p>
        <p>But skip the fussy crab cake split in two and stuffed, sandwich-style, with an avocado-mango coulis. The menu's two salads were also found wanting. The spinach in a bacon-sherry vinaigrette was too sweet, and the mesclun with herbed goat cheese too sour.</p>
        <p>Desserts put the meal back on track. Each was a sweet treat. The mascarpone cheesecake was appropriately creamy, the creme brulee satiny. The warm flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream got thumbs up from chocolate lovers. A zucatto of vanilla and hazelnut mousse wrapped in a layer of cake and cut into big wedges was another hit. The warm apple tart was small but good. A headliner from the old days when this restaurant first opened is still bringing smiles: an Asian five-spice fruit stir fry served warm and capped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>
