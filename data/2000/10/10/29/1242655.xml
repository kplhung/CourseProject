        <p>WITH singers like Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony leading a Latin music explosion, and with Jennifer Lopez able to open one of the summer's biggest movies (''The Cell''), can a Hispanic wave on network television be far behind?</p>
        <p>Well, yes.</p>

        <p>WITH singers like Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony leading a Latin music explosion, and with Jennifer Lopez able to open one of the summer's biggest movies (''The Cell''), can a Hispanic wave on network television be far behind?</p>
        <p>Well, yes.</p>
        <p>While the networks say they are trying to embrace more Latinos -- ''The general atmosphere at CBS is one of inclusion'' said Josie Thomas, senior vice president for diversity -- a look at their fall schedules tells another story. Cheech Marin, the highest-profile Latino in CBS's prime-time lineup, said: ''There are Hispanics on TV? That's news to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marin, who plays Don Johnson's partner on ''Nash Bridges,'' continued: ''It's lonely at the top. It's like the tide. It goes in and out.''</p>
        <p>He recalled his appearance two years ago as host of the American Latino Media Arts Awards, or Alma Awards, an annual event that honors portrayals of Hispanics in film and television. ''Myself, Jimmy Smits, Hector Elizondo, Michael DeLorenzo -- all leads on every network,'' he said. ''We'd reached a high-water mark. Two years later I'm the only guy. It can't get much worse.''</p>
        <p>Of the 1,477 characters on the four major broadcast networks' prime-time series in the 1999-2000 season, only 41, or 3 percent, were Latino, according to a study by the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts. And the new season has introduced few new recurring Hispanic characters. On ABC, the Panama-born Ruben Blades is a father confessor figure to the star, Andre Braugher, in the hospital drama ''Gideon's Crossing''; CBS added Sara Ramirez to the sitcom ''Welcome to New York''; and on Fox, the 19-year-old Mexican-American Jessica Alba plays a sexy superhero in ''Dark Angel.''</p>
        <p>But those gains have been offset by attrition. The cancellations of CBS's ''Chicago Hope,'' NBC's ''Jesse'' and ''Suddenly Susan'' and ABC's ''Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' meant the disappearance of Hector Elizondo, Bruno Campos, Nestor Carbonell and Jon Huertas from the top four networks. Jimmy Smits, Jon Seda and Benjamin Bratt had departed the previous season.</p>
        <p>But cable is beginning to take up the slack. Channels like Lifetime and Nickelodeon are providing more roles for Hispanics, and Showtime's new one-hour drama ''Resurrection Blvd.'' is the first television series produced, written and directed by Latinos. The show, set in East Los Angeles, traces the lives of the Santiagos, a multigenerational family.</p>
        <p>Why have Hispanics been so scarce in Hollywood, part of a city where they make up nearly 44 percent of the population? Dennis E. Leoni, the producer and creator of ''Resurrection Blvd.,'' identified the problem as ''more cronyism than racism.''</p>
        <p>''People in Hollywood don't necessarily see Latinos as people with interesting lives,'' he said, ''because people who buy programming see Latinos as maids, gardeners and service people.''</p>
        <p>Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, an advocacy group, had another answer. Referring to network executives, he said: ''Because they're foolish. They have let their prejudices and biases get in the way of sound economic reckoning. They've been content to believe that we all are Spanish speaking, watching Spanish-language TV and listening to Spanish-language radio. They've been content to leave the market to Univision and Telemundo.''</p>
        <p>And now, apparently, to cable, where Latinos are being portrayed as far more than ''service people.''</p>
        <p>In ''Resurrection Blvd.,'' the patriarch of the Santiago family, Roberto (Tony Plana), is a boxing-obsessed mechanic who dreams that one of his three sons (played by Michael DeLorenzo, Mauricio Mendoza and Nicholas Gonzalez) will become a contender, even though his live-in brother is permanently disabled from his fighting career. On the Lifetime cable channel, ''Strong Medicine'' pairs Rosa Blasi, as a Puerto Rican public health doctor, with Janine Turner, who plays a society gynecologist. In January, Lifetime will present ''City Lights,'' an ensemble cop show set in San Francisco that will feature Lisa Vidal, a Latino, as a detective. (Both Ms. Blasi and Ms. Vidal play single mothers, as does Elizabeth Pena on ''Resurrection Blvd.'')</p>
        <p>Nickelodeon has probably made the greatest strides. ''The Brothers Garcia,'' which had its premiere this summer, is about three school-age siblings growing up in suburban San Antonio. It's a latter-day ''Wonder Years,'' with John Leguizamo assuming the Daniel Stern role of the adult narrator recalling his youth. It has been renewed for another 13 episodes. ''Dora the Explorer,'' an animated show for preschoolers, features a Hispanic star equally at ease in Spanish and English. And Nickelodeon will enter the tween market in January with the half-hour musical series ''Taina,'' about a talented Puerto Rican teenager.</p>
        <p>Nickelodeon's president, Herb Scannell, said that incorporating Hispanic characters in its shows was a logical extension of the network's mandate to ''put real kids on television.'' Mr. Scannell, whose mother was Puerto Rican and who ''ate more rice and beans as a kid than mashed potatoes,'' said he saw diversity as a programming opportunity.</p>
        <p>''Part of the power in diversity is that there isn't a lot on television,'' he said. ''When you embrace diversity, you make TV that is different from a lot of other things. We set out a net for talent that isn't Nancy Drew.''</p>
        <p>''Dora the Explorer'' was originally about a bunny, but the title character evolved into a Hispanic girl. Now this fluidly bilingual program makes children aware of language without becoming, in Mr. Scannell's words, ''a Berlitz tape.'' Because Viacom owns both Nickelodeon and CBS, ''Dora'' has joined the CBS Saturday morning line-up along with ''Blue's Clues.''</p>
        <p>This broadening of Hispanic representation is another example of how cable has opened up television to those who have been excluded by the networks, ''not necessarily by intent or design but by a system that focused on the mass,'' said Tim Brooks, a senior vice president at Lifetime and co-author of ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nogales, of the Hispanic Media Coalition, agrees. ''Cable has broken barriers that broadcasting has been very hesitant to even touch,'' he said. ''Cable is more segmented, is more targeted. So they've got it all over broadcast, who wants to believe that they have to appeal to everyone.</p>
        <p>''It's a small beginning and a beginning that's been long in coming, and it's very little. We deserve a lot more.''</p>
        <p>The numbers support Mr. Nogales's claim. Composing 12 percent of the population, Hispanics are the fastest-growing minority in the United States, having risen to 32 million from 23 million in a decade. They are expected to overtake African-Americans as the largest minority in the near future. From 1993 to 1999, the number of Latinos in households with televisions grew 27 percent, to 28.3 million. Hispanics' annual buying power should top $440 billion this year, according to federal government estimates.</p>
        <p>''In other words,'' Mr. Nogales said, ''a lot of soap. People in the broadcast industry are not doing their jobs by not targeting this segment.''</p>
        <p>Josie Thomas's post at CBS as vice president for diversity was created last spring as a result of a memorandum of understanding between the network and a coalition of ethnic advocacy groups, including the National Latino Media Council, which is based in Los Angeles. The memorandum grew out of the broadcast networks' earlier agreements with the N.A.A.C.P. to seek ways to promote diversity in hiring and programming. Ms. Thomas, a CBS veteran who had been in the business affairs department and had had no specific experience in diversity matters, said, ''We recognize there's a need for significant improvement.''</p>
        <p>Historically, Hispanics have been television's near-silent minority. ''Hispanics have fared even worse than African-Americans in terms of representation,'' said Mr. Brooks, of Lifetime. As a result, said Mr. Nogales, Hispanics have had little control over how they have been portrayed.</p>
        <p>''The dialogue is pretty black and white and doesn't include brown,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean that we are envious of the strides that African-Americans have made. You know they have a small slice of the pie; they're very deserving of that slice. But so are we. We need our slice of the pie.''</p>
        <p>Early representations of Latinos tended to be comic stereotypes. On ''The Jack Benny Show,'' Mel Blanc had a recurring bit as Cy, who called himself ''Si'' -- the whole routine resting on confusion about the pronunciation of a Spanish word. Bill Dana created Jose Jiminez, the Mexican immigrant bellhop. Born on ''The Steve Allen Show,'' the character earned his own NBC program (''The Bill Dana Show'') from 1963 to 1965.</p>
        <p>ABC telecast the swashbuckler ''Zorro,'' starring the non-Hispanic actor Guy Williams, from 1957 to 1959. Ron Simon, a curator at the Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan, said the series was ''one of the most significant of early shows.''</p>
        <p>''It defined Hispanics to the first generation of TV watchers, and especially children,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A more significant show was never shown by a network. ''The Cisco Kid,'' starring Duncan Renaldo and the Hispanic actor Leo Carrillo, was a popular syndicated western about a hard-riding Mexican adventurer and his sidekick and ran for 156 episodes from 1950 to 1955. The Mexican government consulted on the show with the goal of creating a positive ethnic role model.</p>
        <p>Desi Arnaz remains television's most famous Hispanic. Before the debut of ''I Love Lucy'' in 1951, CBS resisted casting the Cuban crooner opposite his wife, Lucille Ball, but she insisted. Mr. Simon said: ''It's very odd for the defining sitcom to have a Hispanic co-star. It was a great formula, the zany housewife playing off the Hispanic straight man. So much of the comedy came from the cultural differences in that relationship.''</p>
        <p>NEVERTHELESS, an industry that thrives on copycatting never recycled that formula. NBC's mid-1970's hit ''Chico and the Man,'' which paired Jack Albertson and Freddie Prinze as an Anglo and a Chicano co-existing in East Los Angeles, came closest. Lesser known was the short-lived series ''a.k.a. Pablo'' starring Paul Rodriguez. In the late 80's and 90's came breakthroughs by actors in ensemble casts, like Mr. Smits in ''L.A. Law'' and Mr. Bratt in ''Law and Order.''</p>
        <p>''Now you have 'Resurrection Blvd.,' '' said Mr. Blades. ''But I don't see the situation changing in a way where I would say it's over, the fever has receded.''</p>
        <p>''The fear with which we're seen, seen as a culture that survived and resists assimilation,'' persists, he said. ''Some people find it very threatening and the choice has been to ignore us. Right now here in Los Angeles, there are more Latinos than any other group. For some people that is very disturbing. Basically we have to try and see if we can work out this fear.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blades, a Grammy Award winning musician who ran for president of Panama in 1994 and finished third, added: ''Many years ago somebody suggested that in order to get better roles in films, I should lose my accent. I don't think it's necessary for a person to lose or gain an accent. That's insulting. We're talking about a cultural background; you're not talking about race. And that is one of the things that has been more threatening in explaining why we're nowhere to be seen for the most part.''</p>
        <p>At stake is more than grabbing a bigger slice of the pie. It is a struggle for self-determination. Mr. Nogales said: ''When I was growing up, TV was almost nonexistent. The family told me who I was, what I was and what my worth was. Now it's very electronic. TV has become a member of our family, and it tells us now who we are, what we are and what we're worth. If you're excluded from creating those images, then the images are going to be made by other people that have no love or knowledge of what we are.''</p>
