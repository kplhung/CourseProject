        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I grew up a true Yankee and Met fan. I was there for Mickey Mantle's last season, in Boston for Bucky Dent's one-game playoff home run and for Game 7 of the Mets' last World Series victory. As a 9-year-old, I remember Cleon Jones trying (and failing) to be the first Met to hit .300. Or the day my beloved Tom Seaver was run out of town. During the Yankee bleak years, I marveled at what Ralph Houk was able to do with not much more than Roy White. So it was with great sadness that I watched the game I love systematically destroyed by owner, then player, greed. My intelligence insulted and my wallet challenged, I swore off Major League Baseball.</p>

        <p>But recently, my attitude started softening; perhaps it was time to introduce my children to the joys of my childhood. But baseball, in its ever increasing lust for dollars, scheduled games so late that they end at midnight or 1 a.m., and my 8-year-old is denied the passage that may never occur again in his lifetime. So far, the first two games have been classics.</p>
        <p>Too bad nobody I know was truly awake for the heroics. A chance to capture the next generation has turned into a blown save.</p>
