        <p>POLICE blotters anywhere can be a grim but fascinating read. But those from the United Nations police force in Kosovo are even more so. Tucked in among the routine domestic disputes and traffic flare-ups are signs that the ethnic war between Albanians and Serbs in the province is still going on, underground, in individual murders, bombings and acts of arson. Sadly, the province has always been heavily armed and has had a high crime rate: robberies and beatings are common, as are abductions of women, and the assumption is that some of those kidnapped will be smuggled to western Europe and sold into prostitution. Attacks on gypsies, or Roma, are also frequent.</p>
        <p>The Unmik (United Nations Mission in Kosovo) police force is dominated by Canadian, American and European officers, backed by 45,000 NATO troops crowded into a province the size of Connecticut. Although Albanians are a majority in the province, Serbs under orders from Slobodan Milosevic dispossessed them of virtually all civil service jobs in 1989. When two-thirds of the Serb population and virtually every Serb who ever wore a uniform retreated in the face of the NATO bombing last year, the province was left unguarded and Albanians were free to take revenge.</p>

        <p>Now, the new foreign officers -- known as ''Coca-Cola cops'' because of their red-and-white cars -- are both patrolling and trying to teach their junior partners, Kosovar Albanian and Serb recruits, how to be real police officers. Excerpts from Unmik police blotters from a recent 10-day period follow.</p>
