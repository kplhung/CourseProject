        <p>WHO does the American man -- specifically the American man somewhere between 25 and 39 with enough money to come home with a single-batch bourbon and $36 tub of Geo F. Trumper's sandalwood shaving cream every now and then -- really want to be? If one were to use the GQ Men of the Year Awards as a measure, the American male doesn't yearn to be staggeringly tall or unkempt or in possession of an affect suggesting he could get Vendela to go to Caracas with him for the weekend if he wanted. The American male looks up to those generally short in stature, hard-working, self-effacing and devoted to children and wives on whom they presumably don't cheat.</p>
        <p>The fifth annual GQ awards, held on Thursday night at the Beacon Theater, celebrated men whom the magazine's readers ostensibly admire most. For the second year in a row, Michael J. Fox won a statuette, this time for his courage in fighting Parkinson's disease. Other recipients included Ted Koppel, Matthew Broderick and Pierce Brosnan, who won for most stylish man of the year and talked about his teenage son when he went on stage to pick up the award.</p>

        <p>WHO does the American man -- specifically the American man somewhere between 25 and 39 with enough money to come home with a single-batch bourbon and $36 tub of Geo F. Trumper's sandalwood shaving cream every now and then -- really want to be?

        <p>The fifth annual GQ awards, held on Thursday night at the Beacon Theater, celebrated men whom the magazine's readers ostensibly admire most. For the second year in a row, Michael J. Fox won a statuette, this time for his courage in fighting Parkinson's disease. Other recipients included Ted Koppel, Matthew Broderick and Pierce Brosnan, who won for most stylish man of the year and talked about his teenage son when he went on stage to pick up the award.</p>
        <p>There appears to be a change afoot in the world of men's magazines, a change that seems suited to a moment in which the libidinously tinged Clinton years are an almost memory and presidential candidates are availing themselves at every opportunity to let voters know that the women they're excited about most are the ones they're already married to.</p>
        <p>Following the wildly successful birth of Maxim magazine in 1996, mainstream men's publications like GQ, Esquire and Details adopted its Michelob-and-babe formula, opting for cover images of exceptionally well-proportioned women in endless contretemps with bikinis that seemed immune to the powers of a dryer.</p>
        <p>Although Maxim, with 2.2 million subscribers, is the leader in the men's field, the formula celebrating sexy women and untamed guy-ness wasn't foolproof for everyone. Details magazine, under the editorship of Mark Golin, who had come from Maxim, ultimately folded. After a five-month interval, it was restarted last month as a sensitive man's lifestyle book, which will feature a guy, not an underwear model, on the cover every month. Inside, Details offers newsy features on people like the convicted killer Kenneth Kimes and service articles like one in which men are instructed on the virtues of making breakfast in bed for their girlfriends. The story includes tips for making homemade jam.</p>
        <p>David Granger, editor in chief of Esquire, said the other day that last April's cover of the indisputably appealing Heather Graham, proved to be the worst selling cover of the year. Mr. Granger, who has served as Esquire's editor for three years and brought more service articles to the magazine, said that what surprises him when he meets with readers is the specificity of questions for which they seek answers. ''They want to know exactly how to tuck their shirts in,'' Mr. Granger said.  ''One guy told me he clipped out recipes from the magazine. We get a lot of mail from people who appreciate its Martha Stewart aspect.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Granger added: ''There's an innate desire to know how to do things and a reluctance to ask. Men don't want to ask each other how to iron their pants. We all want to appear to be masters of the universe.''</p>
        <p>In service of that idea, the November issue of Esquire boasts the cover line ''Be a Better Man: 14 Pages Guaranteed to Make You More Useful.'' On those pages readers can learn how to grow flowers from seed, and the importance of donating money to charities. Meanwhile in the November issue of GQ, a newly instated column titled ''My Twenty Grand,'' which fills readers in on what they can do with an extra $20,000, is devoted to the subject of rugs. ''Stocks may grow nicely for you,'' the heading tells us, ''But how much better to invest in Persian rugs, which enrich your life even as they increase your worth.''</p>
        <p>The mood even seems somewhat tempered at Maxim, which installed a new editor in chief four months, ago -- Keith Blanchard, a Princeton graduate and suburban father who has spent a good part of his career writing for men's magazines. ''Maxim is very much a service magazine,'' Mr. Blanchard said of the publication, which has a readership of young men earning a median income of $62,000 a year. ''It's a strange time to be a guy in America. Men are entering into new worlds that our fathers didn't. Two generations ago, men didn't have to be good husbands. One generation ago, they didn't have to be good fathers. Now, of course, they have to be everything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blanchard said that the word ''guy'' no longer appears in Maxim story headings. ''Maxim was a bit of a political movement when it started,'' Mr. Blanchard said. ''We no longer need to shout on every page that we're a banner of guy-dom.''</p>
        <p>In one sense Maxim doesn't need to apply such a megaphone when it has features on plumbing and cover lines like ''The Girls of Victoria's Secret . . . and More!'' But the magazine's tone is so consistently jokey (case in point: a chart comparing King James to the female model James King) that it is sometimes hard to take offense at its championing of lusty guys with beer guts.</p>
        <p>All of this raises the ultimately unanswerable question of whether men are in fact losing interest in behaving distastefully. Last month's issue of Esquire (the annual ''Women We Love'' issue, which spent pages singing the praises of the Catherine Keener, an actress older than 21 by 20 years) also took a stand against the midlife crisis affair. ''You have seen the wrinkled man in the Carrera with the beret and the blonde pouting next to him,'' an article titled ''Surviving the Midlife Crisis in Style'' read. ''You wouldn't want to be him. Honest.''</p>
        <p>Men are trying hard to be good, we should understand. When they get in trouble, it's the fault of predatory women. A first-person piece in the October issue of GQ told the tale of an English professor who really had every intention of remaining faithful to his wife, but his comely students just wouldn't leave him alone. An article in the less-dignified magazine FHM recounts the tale of a man who felt used when a woman picked him up for a sexual encounter not because she liked him but because she wanted to arouse her husband. Maybe what the male citizenry is really craving is O: the Oprah magazine for men.</p>
