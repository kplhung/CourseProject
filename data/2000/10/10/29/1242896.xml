        <p>THURSDAY night at Shea Stadium, it wasn't which team won or lost, it was who scored the best seats at the game. Celebrities get seats commensurate with their star clout.

        <p>Others were scattered in less desirable locations. The question was how to find them. Celebrities in their usual uniform of baseball caps were never so camouflaged as in this Shea Stadium crowd of 56,521 heads wearing baseball caps.</p>

        <p>THURSDAY night at Shea Stadium, it wasn't which team won or lost, it was who scored the best seats at the game. Celebrities get seats commensurate with their star clout. Billy Crystal sat in the Commissioner's Box. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt had the juice to get those choice seats that spill onto the field toward home plate.</p>
        <p>Others were scattered in less desirable locations. The question was how to find them. Celebrities in their usual uniform of baseball caps were never so camouflaged as in this Shea Stadium crowd of 56,521 heads wearing baseball caps.</p>
        <p>At the entrance to the Diamond Club an hour before game time, the ticket taker had seen only Donald J. Trump and was waiting expectantly for Alfonse M. D'Amato.</p>
        <p>Two police officers nearby saw a woman they could identify only as ''Mike Piazza's girlfriend, Miss Millennium Centerfold in Playboy.''</p>
        <p>''It was a treat,'' one of them said.</p>
        <p>The best seats at Shea Stadium have not only low numbers like 26 or 121, but top of the alphabet letters like AA. Even better are the seats designated Metropolitan Club. And better than that are the Home Plate Club seats, to which food and drink are delivered, and not by folks carrying wide-mouth bottles of beer over their heads in tubs of ice.</p>
        <p>No such perks for Paul Reiser, the stand-up comedian and former star of ''Mad About You.'' He was down front, but halfway between first base and the foul pole. ''I'm a Yankees fan,'' he said, ''but I like the way the Mets are playing here tonight.''</p>
        <p>Seen any other celebrities? ''Jack's here,'' he said. ''Go to the better seats.''</p>
        <p>And there Jack was. Nicholson, of course, the notoriously faithful, smirking Lakers fan. There he was, in Queens, right behind home base, wearing a Yankees cap. ''I've been here all week,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Somewhat farther back was Mel Brooks, tearing into a hot dog with mustard. ''I was born in Brooklyn, so I'm a Dodgers fan,'' he said. ''So I'm rooting for both teams.'' He paused. ''Get out of the way,'' he said, a bit of hot dog bun flying out of his mouth.</p>
        <p>While Paul Reiser was halfway to the foul pole, his former co-star, Helen Hunt, was right behind home base. Of course, she has four new movies coming out this year, including ''Pay It Forward'' (in which she co-stars with Kevin Spacey, who was seated near her), ''What Women Want'' with Mel Gibson and ''Castaway'' with Tom Hanks.</p>
        <p>Nora Ephron did a neat trick. She and John Travolta were talking about their new film, ''Lucky Numbers,'' on ''Charlie Rose.'' But thanks to the magic of tape, she (Mets) was at the same time sitting halfway to the foul pole with her husband, Nicholas Pileggi (Yankees). ''With a really good view of the television screen,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And walking back loaded with food from the concession stands toward seats near third base was Harvey Weinstein, who, as a head of Miramax, is to the New York independent film world what George Steinbrenner is to New York baseball. For one thing, larger than life. Like most Mets fan, he felt he had to explain his passion. (For Yankees fans, it seems enough to say they are Yankees fans -- what more is there to say?)</p>
        <p>''I grew up in Brooklyn, moved to Queens, so of course I'm a Mets fan,'' he said as the game continued and continued to be tied 2-2. ''We're sitting in front of a bunch of Yankees fans. Wall Street types who want the Yankees to win because they think the games are making the stock markets go bad. They will, of course, have to be shot.''</p>
        <p>His wife, Eve, was standing nearby. And she roots for? ''Whatever makes him happy,'' she said.</p>
