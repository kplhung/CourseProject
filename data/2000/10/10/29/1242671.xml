        <p>'One longtime friend of the president,'' wrote Neil A. Lewis of The New York Times, ''said Mr. Clinton was 'livid, off-the-wall angry' about the disbarment proceedings.''</p>
        <p>Off the wall, hyphenated as above when used as a compound modifier of the word it precedes, is a figure of speech that shows staying power.

        <p>'One longtime friend of the president,'' wrote Neil A. Lewis of The New York Times, ''said Mr. Clinton was 'livid, off-the-wall angry' about the disbarment proceedings.''</p>
        <p>Off the wall, hyphenated as above when used as a compound modifier of the word it precedes, is a figure of speech that shows staying power. It can mean ''bizarre,'' with a second sense of ''being a few apples short of a picnic.'' It should not be confused with an earlier phrase, up the wall, ''into a fury,'' now fallen into desuetude. Evidently off the wall, as used above, carries with it some of the fury associated with up the wall.</p>
        <p>Less easy to figure out is the meaning of livid. It is a word that President Clinton used recently in response to a question put to him by a Justice Department counsel seeking his knowledge of illegal campaign contributions: ''All I can tell you,'' said Clinton, ''is that I was livid about it.''</p>
        <p>What color do you turn when you turn livid? Red with anger? Purple with rage? White with fury?</p>
        <p>The Latin livere means ''to be blue.'' The Old Slavic sliva is ''plum.'' (A few shots of the liquor called slivovitz will make you either flushed or ashen-faced.) This is cognate with the Old English sloe, a reddish-purple blackthorn berry that gives a sloe gin fizz its color. Whash neksht?</p>
        <p>Early usage: a writer named Henry de Knyghton used livid in 1258 to describe corpses. Thomas Norton in his 1477 incunabula best seller, ''The Ordinall of Alchimy,'' wrote of ''This Waun Colour called Lividitie, In Envious Men useth much to be.'' That waun suggests the modern wan, ''pale.'' James Fenimore Cooper, in his 1841 ''Deerslayer,'' had a character ''almost livid with emotion,'' but never said what color that was; however, Walter Scott's 1814 use of the word as a modifier of a color -- his trembling lips are livid blue'' -- suggests to me that the meaning was ''pallid, ashen, leaden.''</p>
        <p>The lexicographer Frank Abate, former editor in chief of American dictionaries for Oxford University Press, disagrees: ''The idea of 'pale' in the O.E.D. seems to me to be misleading. The image I have is that of a violently angry person, with eyes bulging and a deep reddish color in the face -- such a deep color that it suggests bluishness.'' There are usages that treat the word as meaning ''black and blue, the color of bruises,'' and a furious person has long been said to get ''blue in the face.''</p>
        <p>Fred Shapiro of Yale reports that ''the contexts of the many early uses I have examined make it clear that the color associated with the state of livid anger is a pale one.'' His citation of Arthur Conan Doyle's 1890 ''His swarthy features blanched to a livid gray'' -- with blanched meaning ''turned white'' -- clinches the primary meaning for me: ''pale, drained of color.''</p>
        <p>This just in: it may not be a color, or lack of color, at all. The word livid has so long been associated with anger that it has lost its coloration and now means ''infuriated.''</p>
        <p>While we're hopping mad, turn to another recent statement of President Clinton that in its expression of irritation touches three dialect bases. Addressing the way the media bash candidates in the current campaign, he observed testily: ''I think it's a bunch of bull. . . . I do not think America is very well served by all this rigamarole. . . . That's a bunch of hooey.''</p>
        <p>Bull, a truncated form of what used to be called ''a barnyard epithet,'' is no longer considered a vulgarism. The animal itself is the acceptable euphemism for its manure. (This has not happened with chicken in a similar barnyardism because the name of the animal already has a slang meaning of ''cowardly.'')</p>
        <p>Rigamarole, which added a syllable to the 1736 rigmarole, means ''incoherent harangue; a lengthy, meaningless procedure or tale.'' It is derived from rig-my-role, which some etymologists say is derived from a ragman's roll or backpack containing a variety of unrelated items.</p>
        <p>Hooey is a mystery. The synonym for ''nonsense, baloney, hogwash'' is cited in the O.E.D. as coined in 1924 in ''Plastic Age,'' by Percy Marks: ''My prof's full of hooey. He doesn't know a C theme from an A one.'' The poet W.H. Auden derided ''Lip-smacking Imps of mawk and hooey,'' and the feminist author Germaine Greer in her 1970 ''Female Eunuch'' rescued equestrian interests of women from psychological leers with ''The horse between a girl's legs is supposed to be a gigantic penis. What hooey!''</p>
        <p>Clinton's usage echoed that of Harry Truman, who told a 1948 news conference that unless it could be adopted on a national scale, ''daylight saving is a lot of hooey.''</p>
        <p>Origin obscure. My speculation: hoo is a sound made with an exhalation of breath that expresses wonderment or disdain. Hoo-boy! Don't make such a hoo-hah. (This speculation could be a blinding flash of insight, or. . . . )</p>
        <p>LANGUAGE ON DEMAND</p>
        <p>Two new ways to deliver books are upon us. One is the e-book, which you can download from the Internet and squint at on your screen or print out on your printer. The other is the print-on-demand book, which you order over the Web or from a traditional bookstore and get a bound copy of in the mail.</p>
        <p>This will mean that just about any literate person can become a ''published'' author. Online services already exist that -- for a few hundred dollars -- will take your digital manuscript and pictures and make them available to buyers for roughly the same price as bookstore books.</p>
        <p>The Internet publishers turn down porn, hate stuff and guides to building H-bombs. However, they do not judge content for quality and cannot, for such a low publishing fee, edit copy. What will the coming wave of amateur authors do to the language? Will we be inundated with vanities in gibberish?</p>
        <p>Maybe not. I punched up iuniverse.com and ordered ''Blow the House Down: The Story of My Double Lung Transplant,'' by Charles Tolchin. I've known Charley since he was a kid with cystic fibrosis given little chance to live. His book, delivered as a $14.95 paperback in about a week, is a stunning, moving, personal account of a young man's bravery in action. Tolchin's unprofessional writing is straightforward, colloquial and frill-free. He has produced an intimate memoir that grabs you and found a new way to distribute it that reaches you.</p>
        <p>Will such disintermediated prose encourage new authors or discourage writing discipline? We'll see. Worth watching.</p>
