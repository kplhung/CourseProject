        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Caryn James's apparent thesis in her essay ''To Get the Best View of Television, Try Using a Wider Lens'' [Oct. 1], is that television is worthy because it is an important reflection of our society. Her argument is sheer tautology.</p>
        <p>She repeatedly relies on what is on television itself as a measure of that same society. This merely demonstrates television's success as a monopolist of public discourse; its main ''reflection'' is of itself. Ms. James further suggests that were we to exit this hall of mirrors we would suffer the horror of being out of touch with our society.</p>

        <p>Caryn James's apparent thesis in her essay ''To Get the Best View of Television, Try Using a Wider Lens'' [Oct. 1], is that television is worthy because it is an important reflection of our society. Her argument is sheer tautology.</p>
        <p>She repeatedly relies on what is on television itself as a measure of that same society. This merely demonstrates television's success as a monopolist of public discourse; its main ''reflection'' is of itself. Ms. James further suggests that were we to exit this hall of mirrors we would suffer the horror of being out of touch with our society.</p>
        <p>As for her contention that television should not be condemned as a whole, Ms. James may be right. If a viewer is willing to research coming programs, he may come up with the isolated program worth checking out. Then, if he can tolerate the incessant advertising, he may get lucky and have a worthwhile viewing experience. But rarely would this be worth the trouble.</p>
        <p>More likely, a viewer will simply flip on the tube out of loneliness, laziness, fatigue or lack of imagination or to avoid others in his household or the horror of being ''left out.''</p>
        <p>When we are willing to recognize those motives as worthy, then we can be satisfied with television's role in society. But spare me the claim of television's value as a ''reflection'' of society.</p>
