        <p>WHY the difference between American policy toward Cuba, a renegade Communist backwater whose dictator is scorned by the United States, and toward North Korea, a renegade Communist backwater whose dictator was feted last week with Californian wines carried by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright?</p>
        <p>One obvious reason is the political importance of fiercely anti-Castro Cubans in Florida. But there is another, more fundamental reason: weaponry.</p>
        <p>Cuba built roads, schools and a conventional army. North Korea built nuclear weapons and missiles that can soar across most or all the Pacific and threaten the United States in the coming years.</p>
        <p>So Washington, after decades of isolating North Korea much as it isolated Cuba, has been forced by this variant of gunboat diplomacy to change its stance.</p>
        <p>In 1994, for example, the United States agreed to help construct billions of dollars worth of new nuclear plants for North Korea, if it abandoned atomic weapons development. From the North's perspective, the crowning achievement of its policy will come this fall, if President Clinton goes ahead with a contemplated trip to meet Kim Jong Il, North Korea's longtime ''Dear Leader,'' more recently its ''Great Leader,'' also known to his people as ''the greatest of great men produced by heaven.''</p>
        <p>Nuclear blackmail, in short, pays pretty well.</p>
        <p>Secretary Albright's visit to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the world's last Stalinist redoubt, put the issue in sharp perspective. She unwillingly boosted the legitimacy of Mr. Kim when she sat with him and watched a grand gymnastic spectacle in which the multitudes used cards to spell out in huge Korean letters: ''Greatest glory to the great leader comrade Kim Jong Il.''</p>
        <p>The Chosun Ilbo, one of South Korea's leading newspapers, harrumphed: ''Are We Paying Again for North Korea's Giving Up Its Missiles?'' The answer is probably yes, if a price can be agreed upon. And that price will set the benchmark against which North Korea will then be able to negotiate further payoffs for giving up what intelligence experts believe are its considerable stockpiles of sarin nerve gas, mustard gas and various biological weapons, possibly including smallpox.</p>
        <p>All this suggests that Kim Jong Il may be a shrewder leader than many people realize. For more than a decade, he has been portrayed largely as a buffoon, a playboy, a sadist, a maniac and a demented terrorist. Intelligence officials have talked about how he raced cars, attended to a harem of Scandinavian blondes, accumulated thousands of Western videos, executed aides and developed a bouffant hairstyle to add an inch or two to his 5-foot, 2-inch stature. He also repeatedly changed his name --  from the Russian name Yura, which he used in his youth, to Jong Il (meaning Jong the First), to a homonym Jong Il (meaning Jong the Sun). But for a supposed buffoon presiding over a famine-stricken land, Mr. Kim has done remarkably well in high-stakes international poker.</p>
        <p>''They have played a weak hand very well,'' said Mitchell B. Reiss, a North Korea expert who is dean of international studies at the College of William and Mary.</p>
        <p>Yet it is not that Americans have played badly. Rather, their cards were never very appealing.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the United States pressed North Korea hard to abandon its nuclear program, threatening a naval blockade if it did not. At the time, North Korea warned that it could turn the South Korean capital of Seoul into ''a sea of flames.'' Many military officials now say that the United States and North Korea came perilously close to war, much closer than was generally realized at the time. And while the United States clearly would have won, North Korea in its tormented death throes might have killed vast numbers of civilians in South Korea.</p>
        <p>In the end a war was averted, thanks to the intervention of former President Jimmy Carter. The United States grumpily agreed to help build nuclear reactors for North Korea and supply it with fuel oil, arguably an unprincipled payoff, which most believe was preferable to a principled war.</p>
        <p>That was nuclear blackmail. Today, instead, it's missile blackmail. In 1998 North Korea developed a new missile, the Taepodong, and sent it arching over Japan for a splashdown in the Pacific. The Taepodong is exceptionally inaccurate and for that reason not very useful militarily, but it still makes a valuable poker chip.</p>
        <p>Once again, while everyone chafes at the idea of payoffs, blackmail and bribes, many diplomats believe that the alternatives are worse. As Walter Slocombe, a former under secretary of defense, once put it, leaving North Korea to its own devices would allow it to begin ''turning out plutonium like sausages.''</p>
        <p>In a new book ''North Korea: Through the Looking Glass'' (Brookings Institution, 2000), Kongdan Oh and Ralph C. Hassig review the policy options, underscore their flaws, and then cite John Kenneth Galbraith's letter to President Kennedy in 1962: ''Politics is not the art of the possible. It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Oh and Mr. Hassig say that some payoffs, regrettably, are probably necessary in the short run, and they add with equal regret that the only carrots that will lead the Dear Leader to change his behavior are those that will strengthen his dictatorship. ''So the problem,'' they write, ''is this: the kind of rewards that might reduce the Kim regime's hostility will strengthen that regime and will therefore prove unpopular among democratic donor states.''</p>
        <p>PROFESSOR REISS noted that while the rewards for North Korea have been unusual in scale, there is a long history of the United States offering ''inducements'' to other countries in similar situations. This began with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's ''Atoms for Peace'' program. Even today, United States policy toward countries like Pakistan and Iran rewards them economically, with trade, investments and loans from international organizations, if they steer away from nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>''Is this a bad example?'' Professor Reiss asked of American policy toward North Korea. ''Are other countries going to develop nuclear weapons programs so that they can trade them for economic development?'' His answer is probably not, but if that were to happen, it might not be so awful to buy them out as well.</p>
