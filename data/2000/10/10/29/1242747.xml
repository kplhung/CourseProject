        <p>To the Editor: Ahead of the winter travel season I want to share the extraordinary courtesy we experienced a recent trip to Mexico.</p>
        <p>Driving south towing our 30-foot sailboat to Puerto Vallarta, we were at the end of the day and nearing Culiacan, where we could find no motel listed in our guidebook.</p>
        <p>We continued and found ourselves in rush hour traffic headed for the city center with nary a motel in sight. As optimism turned to desperation we were hailed by a man who offered to guide us to safe parking for car, boat and trailer, assuring me of their security as he was with the police.</p>
        <p>We followed him, and magically motorcycle policemen halted traffic for our U-turn. Our friend led us into the well-guarded police helicopter hangar. He conducted us to an elegant downtown hotel and arranged for us to be picked up next morning and guided back to the toll road. These helping hands made our Mexican sojourn one we are eager to repeat.</p>
