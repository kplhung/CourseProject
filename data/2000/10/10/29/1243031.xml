        <p>Four weeks ago, Stephen Jackson was just a name on the Nets' training camp list, one not even Coach Byron Scott recognized.</p>

        <p>Four weeks ago, Stephen Jackson was just a name on the Nets' training camp list, one not even Coach Byron Scott recognized.</p>
        <p>''This guy was just trying to make this team,'' Scott said today. ''We had his name on the board and I was like, 'Who is he?' I had no idea who Stephen Jackson was.''</p>
        <p>He knows now. Not only did Jackson, a 22-year-old free-agent rookie, make the team, but in the absence of the injured forward Keith Van Horn, Scott also plans to start Jackson at small forward in the Nets' season opener Tuesday against the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers. That caps a remarkable journey for the rookie.</p>
        <p>Jackson did not go to college, choosing instead to try to make a National Basketball Association team after high school. Phoenix drafted him in the second round, No. 47 over all, in 1997, but he did not make the Suns, and since then he has scraped by in basketball wastelands.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Jackson will be officially introduced to the highest level of his sport.</p>
        <p>''I'm excited,'' he said with a broad smile. ''I think I worked hard enough, but I can only get better. Not too many people start in the N.B.A. as a rookie. This is very much unexpected.''</p>
        <p>Scott revealed his plans today after practice. He said he would stick with the starters from the past two games, and that included the 6-foot-8-inch, 220-pound Jackson.</p>
        <p>On Friday, in a 91-83 victory over Cleveland in Cincinnati in the Nets' final preseason game, he scored 13 points in 34 minutes on electrifying dunks and explosive drives to the basket. He averaged 14.8 points a game in exhibitions.</p>
        <p>Jackson is getting the start because Van Horn broke his leg 11 days ago. Kenyon Martin, the No. 1 overall pick in the June draft, will start at power forward.</p>
        <p>Scott had wondered whether to start Jackson or 6-9 Aaron Williams, a seventh-year power forward. He also considered moving Martin to small forward. But Scott wants to start Jackson for an instant spark, then have the comfort of bringing Williams and the veteran Johnny Newman off the bench.</p>
        <p>Jackson knows that learning defensive schemes and the tendencies of N.B.A. players will be challenging. ''This is my college right now,'' he said. ''I missed college, so now this is my studying right here.''</p>
