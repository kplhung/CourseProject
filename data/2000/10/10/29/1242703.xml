        <p>TOMMY, a 12-year-old Indian  boy, born in Canada, searches for a father, rejecting the one he has.</p>
        <p>Tina, his 16-year-old cousin who cannot walk, endures the rituals of an arranged marriage in India, eventually giving up whatever she was searching for, and rejecting everything she doesn't have.</p>
        <p>Somehow, the paths of Tommy and Tina intersect, though not dramatically, in ''Rice Boy,'' a very long night's journey at Yale Repertory  Theater in New Haven.</p>
        <p>The quest for identity and for love  are universalized through specificity, and a playwright can hardly be more culturally specific than Sunil Kuruvilla. Still, the two cousins, not to mention Father, Uncle, Auntie, Granny, and such outsiders as a servant girl, a fish seller, a sari clerk, a kinky umbrella man and a nut seller  are grounded in Indian mores .</p>
        <p>''Rice Boy'' is not transcendent. Although the playwright, a 1999 graduate of Yale Drama School, struggles lugubriously to be charming, the quality of his whimsy is strained.  ''Eventually you will be unhappy,''  Auntie, who is Tina's mother, tells her about marriage. ''But not at the  beginning,'' she assures her daughter. That's as humorous as it gets.</p>
        <p>Oddly, Canada, the playwright's homeland, is shortchanged, even though Tommy's indolent father, a mathematics professor in his own  country, now an unemployed pizza  maker in his land of exile, says, ''I  don't know how to be a Canadian father,'' not that he tries.</p>
        <p>''Rice Boy,'' based on Mr. Kuruvilla's memories of childhood trps to India, does not try to depict a cross section or intertwining of two cultures. Except for its vivid evocations of Indian rites -- the preliminaries  for the making of the unleavened bread, nan; the sprinkling of rice powder for kolams, decorative patterns, on the stage floor; talk of cinammon fields and rosewater ice cream -- Mr. Kuruvilla's play is flat  and meaningless, down to its last line, a reference to boys without girls.</p>
        <p>Liz Diamond, a resident director of the company, appears to have gone round and round to energize it and make it flow. The production is enhanced by ascending and descending screens of many colors, and such  lovely effects as snowflakes, which Granny tastes and pronounces sweeter than the rain.</p>
        <p>One learns of Auntie's infidelity with the family doctor and of Father's misery with his marriage to Tommy's mother who drowned mysteriously and whom he now loves and misses. One hears fathers incessantly undermining their children; no wonder Tommy looks for, and for a time finds, a new one.</p>
        <p>And one listens, captively, to Granny's ravings, never knowing whether they are informational, senile or intended to be poetic. Given her sculpted face, stunningly communicative hands and dancer's grace, Yolande  Bavan provides other diversions, mostly of a choreographic sort.</p>
        <p>In his truly annoying coming of age, the incessantly demanding Tommy hardly progresses beyond whining, though his all-consuming sadness and premonitions of death  remain just an offering for possibilities of depth. Unlike Ms. Bavan, Wayne Kasserman does not possess his own talent to distract. At the end of an hour-long first act, he asks, ''Where should I go?'' and one wonders, who cares.</p>
        <p>A gratuitous, but mercifully shorter second act, winds up with the sort of obligatory narrative provided by a playwright who is compelled to tell us what happens to everybody without quite knowing how to end his own play. At least by then it's really over.</p>
