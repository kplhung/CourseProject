        <p>It was the end of the business day and the bike messenger had one last package to deliver to the St. Regis Hotel.</p>
        <p>He seemed impressed with the high-backed chairs and the rigid guests sitting in them. He admired the crystal chandeliers and the car call booth outside, which he mistook for a shower. He was sweating profusely. He delivered his package, then ducked into the King Cole Bar for a beer.</p>

        <p>It was the end of the business day and the bike messenger had one last package to deliver to the St. Regis Hotel.</p>
        <p>He seemed impressed with the high-backed chairs and the rigid guests sitting in them. He admired the crystal chandeliers and the car call booth outside, which he mistook for a shower. He was sweating profusely. He delivered his package, then ducked into the King Cole Bar for a beer.</p>
        <p>The bar is a polished one; a mix of blue bloods, society skeletons, cigar zealots and well-dressed businessmen who spend 80 percent of their time putting out fires and 20 percent building them.</p>
        <p>The oak bar at 55th Street and Fifth Avenue is lighted like a stage and is best known for the mural ''Old King Cole'' (1894), painted by Maxfield Parrish, that hangs behind it.</p>
        <p>The bottled beer cost $8, which made the bike messenger raise his eyebrows. He produced a $10 bill, left $1 for the barman and began wandering around the lobby with his drink.</p>
        <p>''Ha-him,'' the concierge cleared his throat. The dark-skinned messenger turned around on his heels. ''Ha-him. Sir, sir. If the gentleman would like to take his drink to the bar. If the gentleman would like to take his drink to the bar.''</p>
        <p>The messenger swallowed his drink whole, set the empty glass on the desk and left by the side entrance.</p>
        <p>Watching from the bar was Thomas Scott, a lonesome businessman, who turned to his glass as if something might be determined from the ice cubes.</p>
        <p>He is a man of a certain sophistication. His watch is expensive, and he was smoking a Cuban cigar that he brought from out of the country because cigars here are, well -- and he wrinkled his nose at this -- ''gamy.''</p>
        <p>''Racism, you know, I just hate that,'' Mr. Scott, a white man, said about the bike messenger incident. ''What people don't realize is education is the root of it.</p>
        <p>''If you're educated, then racism doesn't exist,'' he said. ''Poor people need to educate themselves.''</p>
        <p>Then he was on to other things.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Bill, another Johnny Black on the rocks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scott is in the consulting game. He travels half the year and he knows every hotel bar in New York from 76th Street to Gramercy Park. The Four Seasons? ''Worse than the lunch room at General Motors.'' The Waldorf-Astoria? ''Shabby, like a garage sale.''</p>
        <p>The King Cole, on the other hand, is discreet and dark and the drinks are muscular. And this is preferable to a man with a wife and a baby back home. Mr. Scott was expecting an old girlfriend who happened to be in town from Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''You know traveling used to be fun, now it's just lonely,'' he said. ''It's like being in the Army. It sounds really great to be in the Army. Then once you're in the Army, you think. 'Oh, man, what am I doing in the Army?' ''</p>
        <p>He has never been in the Army, just the consulting game. But when the woman arrived, he stood, saluted the barman and they slipped off into the evening.</p>
