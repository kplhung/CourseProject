      <abstract>
        <p>Nearly 70 percent of Americans reckon themselves part of middle class, but economists, sociologists and politicians have reach no agreement on definition of middle class; graphs, map and statistics offer a look at 'mathematical middle,' which embraces only 20 percent of population (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>COURTING the middle class, as presidential candidates are wont to do, requires no great political calculus: most Americans -- nearly 70 percent by one count -- reckon that the siren song is directed at them. And while it's true that some wealthier folk are comfortable with the label of upper-middle class, and a good quarter of industrious citizens will tag themselves working class, stark categories like ''upper class'' and ''lower class'' remain unpopular.</p>
        <p>Self-selecting one's station, however, is a luxury afforded only by polls, while defining the actual middle class has kept economists, politicians and sociologists busy for decades.</p>

        <p>COURTING the middle class, as presidential candidates are wont to do, requires no great political calculus: most Americans -- nearly 70 percent by one count -- reckon that the siren song is directed at them. And while it's true that some wealthier folk are comfortable with the label of upper-middle class, and a good quarter of industrious citizens will tag themselves working class, stark categories like ''upper class'' and ''lower class'' remain unpopular.</p>
        <p>Self-selecting one's station, however, is a luxury afforded only by polls, while defining the actual middle class has kept economists, politicians and sociologists busy for decades.</p>
        <p>No official definition exists.</p>
        <p>Some experts advocate an equation of poverty-rate-times-three. Others prefer to pinpoint the median income for all households (currently around $40,000) and find some range above and below it. And every formula is flawed to the extent that it fails to accurately measure the debts, expenses and investments that inform day-to-day life for most people.</p>
        <p>Still, there is a range of household income, and somewhere in that, there's a middle. The following is one way of defining the nation's bourgeois, and it may be surprising to learn that this middle class, the mathematical middle, isn't quite so well-heeled as the middle class Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George Bush are romancing.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 5, 2000, Sunday  A chart last Sunday illustrating definitions of the middle class referred incorrectly to families' average spending on fuel. The $737 expense for fuel oil is annual, not monthly. The $50 monthly item was for natural gas, not gasoline.</p>
