        <p>Baldwin trailed Lawrence by 13-0 yesterday, and the Bruins' homecoming crowd had little to cheer. But two fourth-quarter plays got Baldwin and its fans back in the game.</p>
        <p>With 6 minutes 46 seconds left to play, Lawrence (2-5) turned the ball over on downs at the Baldwin 12-yard line. Bruins running back Sean Treasure, a team captain, took a handoff on first down and ran 88 yards for a touchdown, which helped cut the deficit to 13-7 and brought the crowd to life.</p>
        <p>Treasure struck again after Lawrence turned the ball over on downs at the Baldwin 30 with 2:16 left. On first down, he took a handoff and ran 70 yards for a touchdown, and Baldwin (4-3) won the game, 14-13.</p>
        <p>Treasure, who gained 247 yards on 19 carries, became Conference I's career leading rusher (3,323 yards).</p>
        <p>In another Long Island homecoming game, the visitors turned the tables on the hosts as Garden City defeated Wantaugh, 18-14.</p>
        <p>Wantaugh (6-1) held a 14-3 halftime lead in a battle of unbeatens.</p>
        <p>Garden City (7-0) began its comeback with a third-quarter interception by the senior Mike Miller, who ran 30 yards to the Wantaugh 30-yard line to set up a touchdown that made the score 14-9. With 2:34 left and his team trailing, 14-12, Garden City's senior quarterback, Dave Kang, led his team on an 80-yard touchdown drive that ended with a 25-yard pass to the junior receiver Chris Gumelia for the victory.</p>
        <p>Amityville (7-0) handed King's Park (6-1) its first loss of the season, 28-13. Halfback Eugene Nottingham carried the ball 16 times for 171 yards and a touchdown, and fullback Jermaine Byrd carried the ball 15 times for a career-high 156 yards in the victory.</p>
        <p>Defensive tackle William Brown had 10 tackles and an interception, and defensive end Dan Heffron added 11 tackles.</p>
        <p>Commack (7-0) gave Longwood (0-7) a 64-8 thrashing, but the story was the personal achievements of Commack's two stars. Quarterback Mike Prahalis's 4 touchdown passes gave him 21 for the year, tying the Long Island record.</p>
        <p>Two of those scoring passes went to receiver Bryan Tornee, whose 13 touchdown catches this season tied the Long Island record.</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>HACKENSACK (7-0) held on for an 8-0 victory over a tough BLOOMFIELD (5-2) team on a day when everything seemed to go wrong for the Comets. On its second possession of the game, Hackensack's star running back, Kaliym Hazel, dislocated his elbow; that will probably keep him out for at least two weeks.</p>
        <p>But Hackensack's defense held Bloomfield to six first downs, three of which came on penalties. Steve Gomez, a senior safety, had a second-quarter interception to end a Bloomfield drive, and the junior inside linebacker Jahmar Harmitt had six tackles in the winning effort.</p>
        <p>''This one's a character builder,'' Hackensack Coach Ralph Dass said. ''I was happy to get out of there with a win.''</p>
        <p>Joe Albarelli continued his strong play on both sides of the ball in 8-0 DELBARTON's 29-7 victory over PASSAIC VALLEY (4-3). Albarelli had 3 touchdowns as a fullback and 10 tackles and a sack as a linebacker. Defensive end Mike Connor chipped in with six tackles and two sacks.</p>
        <p>Ibrahim Halsey, a junior running back, led ELIZABETH (6-1) to a 41-6 victory over WESTFIELD (4-3). Halsey racked up 375 total yards: he carried the ball 19 times for 300 yards and returned a punt 75 yards for a touchdown. The senior captain Sayon Lembrick had 13 tackles and 2 tipped passes to lead the defense.</p>
        <p>ST. JOSEPH (6-1) of Montvale beat PARAMUS (4-3), 41-27, as the junior running back Jon McPhee carried the ball 16 times for 169 yards and touchdowns of 45 and 40 yards.</p>
        <p>MOUNTAIN LAKES (6-1) defeated WHIPPANY PARK (2-5), 28-13, as Doug Wilkins broke the Morris County record for coaching victories. Wilkins, 237-90-5 over 35 years at Mountain Lakes, surpassed the former Delbarton coach Bill Reagan Sr.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK CITY</p>
        <p>MOUNT ST. MICHAEL (4-3) defeated STEPINAC (3-5), 21-6. The junior fullback Dennis Void gained 113 yards on 19 carries and scored twice, and halfback Geoffrey Carter added a 4-yard touchdown run to lead the Mount.</p>
        <p>MIDWOOD (3-5) blocked two punts in the first half and went on to defeat JEFFERSON (2-6), 21-12. Aaron Boxer recovered one of the blocked punts and also had nine tackles and a fumble recovery as Midwood's games continue to be decided by special teams.</p>
        <p>RIVERDALE (5-2) beat PALISADES PARK (2-5), 14-13, thanks to the defensive pressure of two of their linemen. The junior tackle Dylan Chase and the senior tackle Alex Levine, who have been lining up next to each other for three years, combined for 13 sacks.</p>
        <p>POLY PREP (8-0) shut out LAWRENCEVILLE (2-5), 46-0, behind Marcus Wilson's three touchdown runs.</p>
        <p>HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL  Correction:  November 5, 2000, Sunday  A sports article last Sunday about high school football on Long Island misspelled the name of the school that played Garden City. It is Wantagh, not Wantaugh.</p>
