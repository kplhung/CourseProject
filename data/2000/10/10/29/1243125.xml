        <p>RESSLER-Ira Richard. Died on October 27, 2000 in New York City at the age of 78. Beloved husband for 50 years of Dorothy, devoted father and father-in-law of Bruce &amp; Ellen Ressler, Jonathan Ressler, Debra and Leon Black, Richard and Alison Ressler, and Antony Ressler and Jami Gertz, loving brother of Gladys Nachamkin and the late William Ressler, and adored grandfather of Benjamin, Joshua, Alex, Victoria, Matthew, Michael, Samantha, Jillian, Andrew, Rebecca, Oliver, Nicholas &amp; Theo. Ira Ressler was a decorated veteran of the United States Army Air Corps in World War II where he served with distinction, receiving the Air Medal for Bravery and the American Defense Service Medal with Star. He was a respected member of the New York Bar &amp; a highly regarded trial attorney with his own firm, Ressler and Ressler, for 52 years. His proudest achievement was his family-his wife and children, their spouses and grandchildren-around whom his life truly centered. Funeral at 10 A.M., on Sunday, October 29, 2000 at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street.</p>
        <p>RESSLER-Ira. We extend our deepest sympathy to our dear friend Debra Black on the passing of her beloved father. We offer our condolences to her mother Dorothy, her brothers Bruce, Tony, Jonathan and Richard and to the grandchildren and family members that gave Ira so much joy, pride and pleasure during his very full lifetime. Patricia and Alan B. Abramson, Adam and Josh</p>
        <p>RESSLER-Ira. I am saddened by the loss of Ira Ressler, loving husband, cherished father and grandfather. I will always keep in my heart the wonderful times I spent with him and fondly remember our long chats, his loving spirit, kindness and devotion to his grandchildren. Zachary Kleinhandler</p>
        <p>RESSLER-Ira. Extraordinary husband, father and grandfather. A dear and kind friend. Our condolences to the entire family. Terry and George Eisenpresser</p>
