        <p>BEFORE funk was music, it was a smell: the earthy tang of hard labor or uninhibited lust, of the human body in all its physicality. OutKast, the Atlanta group that made Southern hip-hop competitive with anything from the East or West Coast, puts a funky Southern-accented ''stank'' at the core of its fourth album, ''Stankonia'' (LaFace/Arista 26072).</p>
        <p>Bumping and grinding, slipping and sliding, OutKast's music savors the viscous propulsion of funk, with raps and tunes that never ignore the body and its instinctive desires. ''Stankonia'' begins and ends with heavy-breathing encounters, and sexual banter continues through most songs. If it wanted to, OutKast (with its collaborating musicians from Organized Noize) could easily pump out one-dimensional dance records like Mystikal's shallow but enjoyable ''Let's Get Ready.'' Yet OutKast -- taking cues from a band it obviously reveres, Parliament-Funkadelic -- never forgets that bodies are attached to minds.</p>

        <p>BEFORE funk was music, it was a smell: the earthy tang of hard labor or uninhibited lust, of the human body in all its physicality. OutKast, the Atlanta group that made Southern hip-hop competitive with anything from the East or West Coast, puts a funky Southern-accented ''stank'' at the core of its fourth album, ''Stankonia'' (LaFace/Arista 26072).</p>
        <p>Bumping and grinding, slipping and sliding, OutKast's music savors the viscous propulsion of funk, with raps and tunes that never ignore the body and its instinctive desires. ''Stankonia'' begins and ends with heavy-breathing encounters, and sexual banter continues through most songs. If it wanted to, OutKast (with its collaborating musicians from Organized Noize) could easily pump out one-dimensional dance records like Mystikal's shallow but enjoyable ''Let's Get Ready.'' Yet OutKast -- taking cues from a band it obviously reveres, Parliament-Funkadelic -- never forgets that bodies are attached to minds.</p>
        <p>OutKast is a dialectic turned into a group. On one side is Andre Benjamin, alias Dre or Andre 3000, who's got a whole community on his mind. He's worried about a ''stack of questions with no answers'' and about a ghetto where guns, drug sales and flashy materialism create a cycle of violence.</p>
        <p>Dre's partner, collaborator and antithesis is Antwan Patton, or Big Boi, whose concerns are more immediate: women, weed, tequila and maintaining his street credentials. While Dre is a confident but uneasy idealist, Big Boi is a selfish individualist only a few steps removed from the gangsta milieu. He's more of a party guy than a thug, but he's still more belligerent than Dre. After Big Boi and some members of the Goodie Mob rap about gangsta exploits in one song, Dre follows up with a moral judgment: ''It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop/  Wrong reason, whatever the season.''</p>
        <p>In OutKast's songs, the two rappers take disparate routes to any shared topic; neither tries to persuade or reform the other. But their alliance is absolute, a friendship that trumps any differences of opinion. Pluralism reigns; in ''Humble Mumble'' on ''Stankonia,'' Dre runs into someone who ''said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol/ I said 'Oh hell naw!' but yet it's that too.''</p>
        <p>With unassuming brilliance, OutKast has finessed a major rift that now runs through hip-hop. On one side, the more commercial one, are gangsta characters working ever more familiar variations on tales of gunplay and sex, providing pulp thrills for teenagers. On the other side, in a growing backlash, are rappers who see gangsta rap reinforcing the ugliest stereotypes: no longer the defiant power fantasies of inner-city underdogs, but a demeaning show-business shtick that only pretends to be ''keeping it real.'' While the gangsta rappers grow trite and redundant, the consciousness-raising rappers can seem defensive and self-righteous.</p>
        <p>OutKast turns a doctrinal dispute into a continuing conversation, and in doing so it may be not only more tolerant but more realistic than most hip-hop. Friends and families in the offstage world don't divide neatly into camps, while fans may well listen to both Jay-Z's gangsta tales and Talib Kweli's manifestos if they like the music.</p>
        <p>Outkast also neutralizes the old East Coast-West Coast rivalry by simply using whatever it likes from any source. It might be the Parliament-style vamps that carry West Coast gangsta rap or the foreboding minor chords of the Wu-Tang Clan, from New York City; it might be Miami bass, Detroit ghetto-tech or an echo of old-fashioned soul, like ''So Fresh, So Clean'' on ''Stankonia.'' Dre is both a rapper and singer, and while he's more skillful as a rapper, every so often he eases into a gospel-rooted growl or a falsetto.</p>
        <p>STANKONIA'' ratchets up OutKast's old grooves. Where the music on OutKast's 1998 masterpiece, ''Aquemini'' (LaFace), relied on relaxed, midtempo funk vamps and physical instruments (or samples of them), much of ''Stankonia'' is faster, harder and funnier. OutKast's producers, particularly the keyboardist David Sheats of the production team Earthtone III, deploy old-fashioned-sounding synthesizers and tinny drum machines; the tracks burble and snicker, blip and snort.</p>
        <p>Some, like the embittered ''Gasoline Dreams,'' add electric guitar, pumping out wah-wah riffs like vintage Funkadelic. Others are stark and almost abstract, like ''?,'' a catechism of self-destructive behavior set to high glissandos, a sample of liquid being poured and a shadowboxing drumbeat, or like ''Slum Beautiful,'' a Prince-style falsetto come-on that sends tape-reversed guitar slithering between stuttered drum-machine beats.</p>
        <p>''B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad),'' OutKast's impressions of its 1999 tour, uses the blunt drumbeat and doubletime rapping that OutKast learned from Miami bass groups; it adds nervous energy with a foreboding organ line, a gospel choir singing the title and a keyboard out of Kraftwerk ping-ponging in stereo. ''Humble Mumble'' translates a Latin beat to staccato synthesizers and turntable scratching, while the rappers toss out perspectives on their mission as rappers; then Erykah Badu glides in to sing about freedom and the meaning of life.</p>
        <p>On some topics, Dre and Big Boi have grown closer. ''Stankonia'' is, in part, OutKast's public reaction to the wealth that accrued from its three previous albums, all million-sellers. In ''Red Velvet,'' they rap about what they've done with their money and about fears of being robbed, warning that it's better to bank the money and help their families than to flash jewelry and cash. ''Bill Gates don't dangle diamonds in the face of peasants when he's Microsoftening the place,'' Dre notes. In ''Spaghetti Junction,'' Big Boi salutes the dangerous street life of pimps and junkies; Dre still worries about burglary, until Big Boi announces that he has a gun and is ready to use it.</p>
        <p>ON ''Aquemini,'' OutKast made an effort to identify with ordinary people; on ''Stankonia,'' they barely try. ''Ms. Jackson'' apologizes to the mother of the woman who had a child with the narrator, warns ''her grandchild is a baby and not a paycheck'' and vows to be on hand for both the child's first day of school and graduation; the piano track turns into ''The Wedding March.'' Babies are on OutKast's mind; the album's one real misfire, ''Toilet Tisha,'' is about a 14-year-old girl who kills her newborn child, and it founders on some extreme overacting.  Unfortunately, OutKast doesn't have much sympathy for women. While Big Boi and Dre have two very different takes on gangsta behavior, OutKast still trots out gangsta-rap stereotypes of women as gold-diggers, nymphomaniacs and whores. Dre is only slightly more romantic than Big Boi and their Goodie Mob guests. But even during the obnoxious passages, OutKast's musical instincts come through. The rush of words turns into percussion, catchy choruses show up, and, somehow, the skeletal patterns of keyboards and drum machines mesh as transparent and synthetic funk. It reeks not just of carnality but also of ambition.</p>
