        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>PERSIAN MIRRORS: The Elusive Face of Iran, by Elaine Sciolino. (Free Press, $26.) An informed portrait of Iran, by a senior correspondent of The Times who has visited and covered the country since the 1970's; she finds it more democratic now than ever, with the mullahs' influence declining as the population grows younger.</p>
        <p>EINSTEIN IN LOVE: A Scientific Romance, by Dennis Overbye. (Viking, $27.95.) An antiromance, really, in which Overbye, the deputy science editor of The Times, applies recent discoveries about Einstein to examine both his scientific work and his emotional life; in the end, he portrays the great scientist as a rat with women and an irresponsible father.</p>
        <p>ONE DROP OF BLOOD: The American Misadventure of Race, by Scott L. Malcomson. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $30.) A bold effort to erase the border between insider and outsider views of race, tracing the American invention of white and nonwhite categories as well as the racial histories of Indians, African-Americans, white Americans and Oakland, Calif., the author's hometown.</p>
        <p>THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, by Joy Williams. (Knopf, $25.) An intelligent, unsettling, audacious, virtuosic, improbable novel that may not want the reader's affection; the protagonist, a motherless girl of 15 in the desert Southwest and an absolutist animal lover, certainly doesn't.</p>
        <p>THE BRIDEGROOM: Stories, by Ha Jin. (Pantheon, $22.) Twelve stories set, like the author's novel ''Waiting,'' in provincial (but for American readers, exotic) Muji City, where, as China approaches capitalism, all kinds of tyrannies, personal and institutional, beset inoffensive people who just want to get by.</p>
        <p>THE HILL BACHELORS, by William Trevor. (Viking, $22.95.) Short stories, generous and exploratory rather than clinical or satiric, though corrupted or depraved characters are most vivid; often animated and provoked by reflections on the Troubles in Ireland, where Trevor was born, though he has lived in England for decades.</p>
        <p>PARIS TO THE MOON, by Adam Gopnik. (Random House, $24.95.) Essays about France, that admirable country, by the Paris correspondent of The New Yorker from 1995 to 2000; written for the magazine but now augmented with new and sometimes more personal material, they make a serious intellectual project of inspecting the details of middle-class life.</p>
        <p>BELLOW: A Biography, by James Atlas. (Random House, $35.) A huge, scrupulous, faithfully exhaustive account of the endless life (85 and still going strong both as novelist and father) of Saul Bellow.</p>
        <p>CHERRY: A Memoir, by Mary Karr. (Viking, $24.95.) In this sequel to ''The Liars' Club'' (1995), Karr elaborates the adolescence that leads her to leave home at 17; the most mundane events (first kiss, etc.) are rendered in gorgeous prose, the sexual adventures are both mild and sweet, and we hear hardly anything intended to characterize the 1960's.</p>
