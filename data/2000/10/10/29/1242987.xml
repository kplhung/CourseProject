        <p>It's that time of year when creepy crawlers everywhere forsake their dark lairs for the telelvision screen's bright lights. What child doesn't appreciate a good Halloween scarefest - from tales of magic and mischief to fright-night features that send teenagers and their parents running for cover? Here is a selection of programming for young ghouls of all shapes and sites.</p>

        <p>It's that time of year when creepy crawlers everywhere forsake their dark lairs for the telelvision screen's bright lights. What child doesn't appreciate a good Halloween scarefest - from tales of magic and mischief to fright-night features that send teenagers and their parents running for cover? Here is a selection of programming for young ghouls of all shapes and sites.</p>
        <p>- Kathryn Shattuck</p>
        <p>For young archaeologists old enough to handle dark and reary tombs, Discovery Channel unravels the mystery of death and decomposition in ''The Ultimate Guide: Mummies,'' an hourlong special tomorrow at 8 p.m. Scientists get to the heart (and stomach and brain) of the subject by lifting the bandages on mummies past and present, including an 500-year-old Peruvian (left), a 3,500-year-old Egyptian and Joseph Paul Jerigan, an inmate who donated his body to science in 1994 and was turned into a ''virtual mummy'' by the National Library of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Bear and the gang carve a pumpkin, make costumes and go trick-or-treating on ''Bear in the Big Blue House,'' today at 8 a.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 and 10:30 a.m. on the Disney Channel. Between 9 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. today and Tuesday, preschoolers can join in the mayhem with Halloween-themed episodes of the Disney series ''PB&amp;J Otter,'' ''Out of the Box'' and ''Rolie Polie Olie,'' while older children can test their mettle tonight with scary episodes of ''The Jersey,'' ''In a Hearbeat'' and ''The Famous Jett Jackson'' (also on Tuesday night at 6).</p>
        <p>Suspicions of the supernatural abound when a Barthok slave trader is mistaken for an evil spirit because of his pumpkin-shaped head on ''Men in Black: The Series,'' Tuesday at 3 p.m. of Kids' WB. Other specical episodes of WB series on Halloween afternoon include ''The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries,'' in which Granny seeks shelter at Count Blood Count's Transvylvanian castle, and ''Batman Beyond,'' the story of students who come to believe that the ghost of a dead classmate is haunting their high school.</p>
        <p>In Nicaragua, villagers awake with welts on their legs and cattle bear telltale bite marks on their flesh. In Louisiana, precious wetlands are consumed mile by mile. In the big city, bold intruders crawl out of sewers and bring fear into family dwellings. An alien invasion? Tonight at 8 on CNBC, ''National Geographic Explorer'' looks at things that go bump in the night as it takes it cameras, and anyone who's not afraid of the dark, into the caves of vampire bats (above), the bayous where swamp rats roam, and the dingy basements and subway tracks that New York City rats call home.</p>
        <p>Magicians like Robert Gallup, right, risk life and limb in ''World's Most Dangerous Magic,'' on Tuesday at 7 p.m. This hourlong display of death-defying feats (not appropriate for the faint of heart) is part of Fox Family's ''13 Days of Halloween.'' today the network touches on the supernatural with ''Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' (2 p.m.), and ''The Haunting of Seacliff Inn'' (4 p.m.) and ''The Haunting of Sarah Hardy'' (6 p.m.) before indulging in some modern-day witchcraft with ''Champions of Magic'' and ''David Blaine: Magic Man'' (tomorrow at 6 and 7 p.m.) and ''World's Wildest Magic'' (Tuesday at 6 p.m.).</p>
