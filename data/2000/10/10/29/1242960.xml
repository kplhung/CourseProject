        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your article ''The Empty Booth'' (Oct. 1), you have the answers at your fingertips. One look at the Electoral District boundaries of the 54th Assembly District and you can see the obvious gerrymandering. Communities like Clinton Hill, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick, Highland Park and Cypress Hills have been divided among several Assembly Districts. How does this promote neighborhood empowerment and interest in the electoral process?</p>
        <p>Incumbent elected officials will use reapportionment based on the 2000 census to stay in office. This will result in the continued division of  neighborhoods. Electoral district boundaries will be designed to grease the wheels of another term for incumbents. They have no interest in increasing voter turnout, which could only help the opposition.</p>

        <p>Is it any wonder a majority of New Yorkers vote for none of the above by staying home on both primary and general election day?</p>
