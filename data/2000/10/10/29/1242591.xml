        <p>THE ATLANTIC SOUND</p>
        <p>By Caryl Phillips.</p>
        <p>275 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $25.</p>
        <p>Caryl Phillips was born in St. Kitts, but he's been an Englishman almost from the start, and has since become nearly as much at home in New York as he is in London. He is uncommonly well placed, therefore, to ponder the relationship between people of his own ancestry and those of Europe and North America, as well as that which has lately and self-consciously been pursued by black Americans and West Indians anxious to reclaim their stake in Africa. Because he's a writer and not an academic or a polemicist, he has done this lyrically in ''The Atlantic Sound,'' with an extremely balanced assessment divided into five episodes, each casting further light on the intricate patterns and prejudices of race. Many characters flit across Phillips's pages and some of them are already familiar to us, from Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (splendidly described by someone here as ''a gin-swilling horse owner'') to, inevitably, Frederick Douglass, Marcus Garvey and Thurgood Marshall. Also Judge J. Waties Waring and his wife, Elizabeth, of Charleston, S.C., who emerge as the most heroic figures in the book.</p>
        <p>Phillips's starting point is a voyage he himself made to England from Guadeloupe aboard a banana boat, roughly retracing the route he and his parents followed when he was a 4-month-old infant. Once in England, he takes us to Liverpool to follow the fortunes of John Emmanuel Ocansey, a young black man who in 1881 sailed from the Gold Coast (latter-day Ghana) in order to recover some money his merchant father was owed by a shifty Liverpudlian. Ocansey seems not have been treated indecently on Merseyside -- that is Phillips's interpretation, at least -- though he went home almost empty-handed. But his is a walk-on part that introduces us to the mechanics of slavery and Liverpool's role in it. Phillips blends this with his own boyhood recollections of the north of England and what he found there on a more recent visit. He's brave enough to declare what most Britons have rarely dared to -- that Liverpool has an atrocious record of racism and violence. (It's also, with Newcastle, a place whose citizens notoriously tend to whine when things aren't going their way. But, then, bullying and self-pity generally march side by side.)</p>
        <p>It is in the sections on Africa and the United States, however, that ''The Atlantic Sound'' really comes to grips with the essences of race today, including the markedly one-sided passion running between black people of the New World and those of the third. The saddest figure in the book is Mansour, a man Phillips meets in Ghana who has already been deported from Britain as an illegal immigrant, has spent time in Libya and Egypt without success and now has his eyes on America, where, all other avenues having failed him, he hopes to obtain the education Africa has denied him, the passport to prosperity that might enable him to succor the family his father bequeathed, which amounts to four widows and 26 children.</p>
        <p>''The only way up in Ghana is out,'' says Mansour. ''And then you come back with money and a degree. That is how you progress in Ghana. You leave.'' He cannot understand why any blacks lucky enough to enjoy citizenship on the other side of the Atlantic would want to settle in Africa out of some sentimental notion that they will thereby be made whole again after the injury history has inflicted on their people. Very few Africans can. They know only too well what the rest of the world feels it improper to say anymore, that theirs is a very Dark Continent still.</p>
        <p>Yet the children of the black diaspora arrive in swelling numbers, optimistic, self-confident, assertive, only now and then a little perturbed at what they find when they reach their spiritual home. It is Phillips's verdict that they ''expect the continent to solve whatever psychological problems they possess.'' And their tendency to exaggerate everything about their past and their present tries his patience repeatedly. ''This continual rush to overstatement is causing me to suffer from diasporan fatigue,'' he writes. They, it appears, more than the Ghanaians, enthusiastically participate in a jamboree near Accra, but the Panafest doesn't sound like my idea of fun, with everything running late (very late), a series of tacky performances by dance groups and choirs, some shameless cadging by officials and, yes, a ubiquitous T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Kunta Kinte, the hero of ''Roots.'' To cap it all (and to the great consternation of the Americans in the audience), a white ram is sacrificed, its bloody corpse later dumped out of sight behind a drinks booth, where it will no longer offend eyes accustomed to more discreet forms of butchery.</p>
        <p>From start to finish, there are cultural collisions in Phillips's book. In Liverpool, the local blacks are contemptuous of their brothers from afar, and one of them has a very large chip on his shoulder about Jews. Elsewhere, in a sidelight on Zionism, the Israeli authorities are distinctly unpleasant when 26 American blacks arrive for an eight-day tour because they fear these people might decide to settle in the Promised Land, adding to the 2,000 or so black members of the Hebrew Israelite sect who now dwell in the Negev desert. In Ghana, some Jamaicans attending the Panafest bellyache about the hygiene at their hotel, whose management finally ejects them because they insist on cooking in their rooms and smoking pot. By and large, there is naught for our comfort in ''The Atlantic Sound.''</p>
        <p>Until Phillips reaches South Carolina, that is. And here he encounters what has been noble in the evolution of the United States, alongside what has been disgusting. The nobility is supplied by J. Waties and Elizabeth Waring, the disgusting by, effectively, the rest of the white population of Charleston half a century ago. For Judge Waring championed the cause of the black man's civil rights in a series of rulings that scandalized the South and soon made the issue a matter of federal concern. On top of this, the Warings had black people in their home as friends, not merely as servants. He was thus seen as the eighth-generation Charlestonian who had betrayed his own kin, and she was condemned not only for her hospitality but also because she was a Yankee, a divorcee, who spoke her own mind about race relations in an address to the all-black branch of Charleston's Y.W.C.A., gaining much national publicity. The Warings were more than ostracized from local society: their house was stoned and the Klan planted a blazing cross outside their front door. So eventually they moved north, after the judge severed his long-standing connections with the city's Episcopal Church, the St. Cecilia Society, the Charleston Club, the South Carolina Society and the elite Charleston Light Dragoons, in which he had held a captaincy. The Warings returned only after they died (within months of each other, in 1968) and were laid side by side in a white cemetery at an eloquent distance from the other graves. The scene, Phillips says, ''is elegant in its simplicity, and heartbreaking in its loneliness.''</p>
        <p>But a generation later it is in Charleston -- against all the odds, in view of its past -- that we can perhaps take heart at last. For while Phillips is there he watches 1,000 people celebrating the Charleston Festival of African and Caribbean Art. Most of the participants are black, but a sizable number of whites can be seen too. In the streets of the same city through which a third of all the African slaves entering America once passed, there are now dances from Senegal accompanied by drums, as well as stalls selling masks, carvings and clothes, including T-shirts saying ''Imported From Africa'' and ''Black by Popular Demand.'' The young people of both races dress alike in T-shirts, baggy jeans and Nikes, while ''the older black couples seem proud, but cautious at this open display of pride in all things African. They remember when a black person could not vote in South Carolina.''</p>
        <p>The children of slavery have the vote now, though, and much more. Their festival seems more authentic, less contrived, than the goings-on at the Ghanaian Panafest.</p>
