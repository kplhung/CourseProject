        <p>New features in 2001 edition of Rand McNally Road Atlas noted (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The question in the minds of the makers of the Rand McNally Road Atlas for the United States, Canada and Mexico seems to have been: What more can we provide than maps? The answer appears in the 2001 edition, which has, in addition to 5,500 updates and map changes, these new features: lists of road-construction projects; sources for tourist information for states and Canadian provinces, with a few major events for each; temperatures and precipitation in 90-plus cities, and charges on toll roads.</p>
        <p>The focus on road construction carries over to the atlas's maps, which highlight roadwork areas in pale green, and also to the Rand McNally Web site, randmcnally .com. On the site, information on roadwork is updated every two weeks, according to the company. Updates are free; you don't have to buy the atlas. (Just click on Road Trip Guide and then on the construction barricade in the upper right hand corner of the screen.)</p>
