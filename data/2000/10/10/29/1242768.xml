        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his letter ''Dulling the Senses'' [Oct. 15], Michael Flanagan writes that watching television is a passive activity that relays a ''one-way message.'' This is a simplistic and elitist view of how people watch television and what they learn from it.</p>
        <p>I am a science educator interested in television as a powerful educational agent. As part of a study I conducted for my doctoral dissertation, I asked 60 high school students about the science they watch on television. Many students were critical and questioning of what they saw. Amanda, an 11th-grader, stated that on the news ''they present stuff but they don't tell you where they got it from.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his letter ''Dulling the Senses'' [Oct. 15], Michael Flanagan writes that watching television is a passive activity that relays a ''one-way message.'' This is a simplistic and elitist view of how people watch television and what they learn from it.</p>
        <p>I am a science educator interested in television as a powerful educational agent. As part of a study I conducted for my doctoral dissertation, I asked 60 high school students about the science they watch on television. Many students were critical and questioning of what they saw. Amanda, an 11th-grader, stated that on the news ''they present stuff but they don't tell you where they got it from.''</p>
        <p>She continued: ''I would love to know where they got this information. They just tell you University of whatever -- they don't tell you how long this research has been going on, how many people were involved, what type of people. There's still many questions that can be asked that would really give a different perspective.''</p>
        <p>Television's key role in cultural production, however, is undeniable. The question becomes how can we, as viewers, educators, parents or students, question and critique what we see on television? In the words of a 10th-grader, William, ''If it's not broke, they don't want to fix it. If they don't have problems with it and no one's complaining about it, then they're going to keep it the way it is.''</p>
        <p>We can participate in our culture through dialogue and conversation about the meanings we make of all experience, including the televisual. We err if we place ourselves on a higher cultural plane and ignore a medium so recognizably powerful.</p>
