        <p>Still Flying</p>
        <p>The Jefferson Starship is 35 years old and to mark the milestone, the rock group is off on a ''Volunteers'' tour. That is, the band is performing the 1969 ''Volunteers'' album in its entirety for the first time live on the concert stage. And on Saturday at 8 and 10:30 p.m. the Starship -- with its founders, Paul Kantner and Marty Balin on guitar and vocals; Diana Mangano, vocals; Prairie Prince, drums; Slick Aguilar, guitar; and Chris Smith, keyboard -- lands at the Inter-Media Art Center on New York Avenue in Huntington (631) 549-9666.</p>

        <p>'Astronomy Jamboree'</p>
        <p>Dedicating this year's entry to ''Hypatia's Daughters: Women in Science,'' the Custer Institute holds its ''22nd Annual Astronomy Jamboree'' Friday through next Sunday at its headquarters on Main Bayview Road in Southold. The weekend begins at 7 p.m. Friday with poetry readings, a wine tasting, music and all-night observing via the institute's telescopes.

On Sunday there will be pre-sunrise observing and a ''Cosmic Nature Walk'' (631) 893-7000.</p>
        <p>Community Theater</p>
        <p>A flair for the dramatic -- or comedic or musical -- sometimes never disappears. Hence community theaters, which afford avocational thespians a chance to show their stuff and which are in full bloom these days on the Island. Like drama? The Playcrafters perform William Inge's ''Bus Stop'' through Saturday at the Bellport Middle School on Kreamer Avenue (631) 748-7803. Or how about ''Defying Gravity,'' Jane Anderson's play about the 1986 Challenger disaster, which the Synergy Ensemble Theater Company offers from Friday through Nov. 18 at Town Hall West, Main Street, in Islip (631) 864-1070. Mystery is the message through next Sunday in Ira Levin's ''Deathtrap'' at the North Fork Community Theater, Sound Avenue in Mattituck (631) 298-6328.</p>
        <p>Musicals get the treatment in ''Crazy for You,'' Saturday through Nov. 19, at the Suffolk Y-J.C.C., Hauppauge Road in Commack (631) 462-9800, and in ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' which the Guild for the Arts performs at 2:30 p.m. today at South Side Middle School, Hillside Avenue, in Rockville Centre (516) 764-1558.</p>
        <p>Finally, comedy reigns in East Northport where the United Players offer the Moss Hart-George S. Kaufman classic ''You Can't Take It With You'' from Friday through Nov. 12 at the Union United Methodist Church, Pulaski Road (631) 368-9247, and in Huntington where the Village Theater Company presents Neil Simon's ''Gingerbread Lady,'' from Saturday through Nov. 19, at the Touro Law Center, Nassau Road (631) 424-4600.

R. Gurney's ''Dining Room,'' Thursday through Nov. 12 (631) 288-1500.</p>
        <p>More Halloween</p>
        <p>Though Halloween isn't until Tuesday, the holiday continues to haunts us this week. For example, today from noon to 4 p.m. at Wheatley Plaza on Northern Boulevard in Greenvale, Hugh McMahon, billed as a ''celebrated pumpkin carver,'' will, you guessed it, carve an 800-pound pumpkin, billed as ''one of the largest carved pumpkins in the tristate area.'' It will be auctioned off, along with other carved pumpkins, to benefit the Bryant Library in Roslyn (516) 627-2277.</p>

The action moves to Tuesday and Brookville for a Hutton House lecture on ''Witchcraft at Salem: By Devils Possessed'' at 10 a.m. on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University (516) 299-2580, and Hempstead when Hofstra University's International Concert Series presents ''Songs to Make You Shiver'' with Roger Latzgo, a musician and singer, at 8 p.m. at the Monroe Lecture Center Theater (516) 463-6644.</p>
        <p>Children's Hours</p>
        <p>By a scheduling chance that brings seven specials to the area, this is the week to be a child on the Island. Unfortunately, parents will have to chose between the program since most of them conflict. Today there are two: Friends of the Arts' ''Children's Carousel'' offers ''Fanticcini,'' the Mum Puppettheatre's entry that turns ordinary objects into puppets, at 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. at the Landmark, on Main Street, in Port Washington (516) 922-0061, or ''Around the World with Mr. Mouse'' Katie Polk's puppet show, at 2 p.m. at the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages on Route 25A in Stony Brook (631) 751-0066.</p>
        <p>On Saturday there are five performances: the Mermaid Theater of Nova Scotia's ''Very Hungry Caterpillar and the Very Quiet Cricket,'' at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. as part of Tilles Center's ''Stage One: The Arts Start Here'' series in Brookville (516) 299-3100; ''Lost and Found,'' via the Puppet Company, at 11 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m. at the Cinema Arts Center on Park Avenue in Huntington (631) 423-7610; a ''SHELabration: Celebrating the Words and Wisdom of Shel Silverstein,'' at 11 a.m. at Theater Three on Main Street, Port Jefferson (516) 928-9100; ''Just So Stories,'' performed by the Crabgrass Theater Company, at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. at Molloy College's Hayes Theater in Rockville Center (516) 766-2908, and, in Roslyn Harbor at 10 a.m., to start ''Culture Kids,'' a performance series at the Nassau County Museum of Art on Northern Boulevard, there is Forces of Nature, an African dance company (516) 484-9338.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY: Playing standards from the chamber music repertory, the Island Chamber Symphony, under Jeremy Kempton's baton, performs at 3 p.m. at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury (516) 686-7640.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in Stony Brook at the State University's Staller Center, using the latest in sonic technology, including computers that listen and machines that sing, music department students and faculty members perform a concert of ''Computer Music'' at 8 p.m. (631) 632-2787.</p>
