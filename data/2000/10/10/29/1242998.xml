        <p>AL GORE  Remarks yesterday at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.:</p>
        <p>''We have 10 days left and much is at stake. We are at a proverbial fork in the road. We can go in one of two very different directions, and the decision will be made in your hearts, according to not only your beliefs about all of these issues that we're discussing up here this evening, but also according to how strongly you feel, how committed you are, how much passion you have for the future of the United States of America.</p>
        <p>I need your hearts. I need you to mobilize. Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and organize.</p>
        <p>My opponent, Governor Bush, likes to say that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today. He recommends that we go back to the kind of policies that we had eight years ago and get rid of the ones that we have today.</p>
        <p>I believe that we need to keep changing and changing in the right direction. I believe that we need to keep going, and recognize that we have made progress.''</p>
