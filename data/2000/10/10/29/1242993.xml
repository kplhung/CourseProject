        <p>It may be that Vladimir Kramnik thinks that the best defense is a good offense.</p>
        <p>In Game 12 of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship in London yesterday, he daringly sacrificed a pawn to attack the enemy king, but when Garry Kasparov stopped it, he retrenched to the other wing, where he attacked the extra pawn. And Kasparov failed to prevent him from recovering it. Thus, a draw.</p>

        <p>It may be that Vladimir Kramnik thinks that the best defense is a good offense.</p>
        <p>In Game 12 of the Brain Games Network World Chess Championship in London yesterday, he daringly sacrificed a pawn to attack the enemy king, but when Garry Kasparov stopped it, he retrenched to the other wing, where he attacked the extra pawn. And Kasparov failed to prevent him from recovering it. Thus, a draw.</p>
        <p>So, Kramnik proceeds along the path to the $1.33 million prize. His lead is 7 to 5, and three more draws would clinch the championship for the challenger.</p>
        <p>The players used the same Rubinstein Variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defense as in Game 10, but after 7 O-O, Kasparov refrained from 7 . . . cd 8 ed, which facilitates the development of the white queen bishop, in favor of 7 . . . dc 8 Bc4 Nbd7.</p>
        <p>After 9 a3, Kasparov captured with 9 . . . cd, allowing Kramnik to obtain the bishop pair with 10 ab. He hoped to create pressure against the backward c3 pawn with 10 . . . dc 11 bc Qc7.</p>
        <p>Kramnik did not deign to protect the pawn with 12 Qb3, but offered a rare gambit with 12 Be2!? to take advantage of his lead in mobilization. Kasparov boldly took him up on it with 12 . . . Qc3.</p>
        <p>Kasparov's 13 . . . Nd5 enabled him to retreat with 14 . . . Qf6 to defend his king.</p>
        <p>After 20 Rh4, Kramnik had five pieces trained on the enemy king position, but so far he had been unable to create a weak point as a target. The threat was 21 Rh6, but that was easy enough to parry with 20 . . . f6.</p>
        <p>With 21 Rc4 Bd7 22 Ba3 b6 23 Be4, Kramnik turned his attention to the opposite flank. And after 23 . . . a6 24 ba Ra6 25 Bc5 bc 26 Rfc1 Ra5 27 Qb2, he had kept open the option of returning to the attack on the black king with 28 Bb1 and 29 Qc2.</p>
        <p>On 27 Qb2, Kasparov should perhaps have tried to make something out of 27 . . . Nb4 28 Qc3 Be8, but if Kramnik does not fall into 29 Rc5? Rc5 30 Qc5 Qc5 31 Rc5 Rd1, the outcome would be unclear, the correct 29 h3 reinstating the threat of 30 Rc5.</p>
        <p>After 33 . . . Qc5, there was nothing left but 34 Qc5 Nc5 35 Nb2 and a draw.</p>
        <p>Game 13 begins today at 3 p.m. London time. The championship match is a maximum of 16 games.</p>
