        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>In the hype surrounding the Roger Clemens-Mike Piazza matchup, Tim McCarver of Fox Sports was unable to admit that Clemens could have been acting with anything but malicious intent. I daresay that Piazza's reaction was caused by nothing other than paranoia and this caused him to expect nothing other than aggression from Clemens. It is a testament to the professionalism and maturity of Clemens and especially Piazza that this incident did not escalate into a brawl.</p>

        <p>I do not deny that Clemens has a temper that gets the better of him at times. I do not defend these times. But this incident was not the loss of self-control by Clemens that the news media have been hoping for. In a perfect world, sportswriters and announcers would enjoy baseball for the game it is, rather than trying to create bad blood between opponents for their own entertainment.</p>
