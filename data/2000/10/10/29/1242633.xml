        <p>Until now, you could truly experience the Divine Miss M. only at a concert performance (Lynn Hirschberg, Oct. 8). The character she created as her stage persona was so much more engaging than many of her movie roles. With this new television venture, Bette Midler will be able to bring her unique combination of self-deprecating humor, ribaldry and musical talent to a much larger audience. I am betting that there are lots of unsuspecting future fans out there who will be amazed to find out what they have been missing.</p>
