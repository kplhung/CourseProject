        <p>Put aside, for the moment, thorny subjects like economic policy and national security. The 2000 presidential campaign is down to a question of geography.

        <p>Put aside, for the moment, thorny subjects like economic policy and national security. The 2000 presidential campaign is down to a question of geography. Eighteen states are in play, political strategists say, and in a startling reversal of received political wisdom, the number of tossup states is actually growing as the days to election day dwindle down to a few.</p>
        <p>The candidates spent the week in a frenzied game of musical media markets, setting their campaign planes down long enough in advertising battlefields like Milwaukee and Pittsburgh and Tampa to speak above the roar of the jet engines and the crowds.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush sent 28 of his fellow Republican governors in teams into the battleground states.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, seeking to reassure those who are leaning to the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader -- whose support in swing states like Oregon and Wisconsin could be decisive -- reaffirmed his commitment to the environment before a throng of 30,000 in Madison, home of the University of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>''For 24 years, I have never backed down or given up on the environment, and I never will in my whole life,'' boomed the author of ''Earth in the Balance.''</p>
        <p>The balance of the campaign, no doubt, will be even more frenetic: the polls seem to seesaw daily between the nominees. For both of them, the enemy is not merely the opposing party, but also time.</p>
