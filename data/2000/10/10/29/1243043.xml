        <p>Yale quarterback Peter Lee threw four scoring passes and safety Ryan LoProto returned two interceptions for touchdowns today as the Elis routed Columbia, 41-0.</p>
        <p>After a scoreless opening period, the swirling winds at Yale Bowl took a toll on Columbia's kicking game.

        <p>Yale quarterback Peter Lee threw four scoring passes and safety Ryan LoProto returned two interceptions for touchdowns today as the Elis routed Columbia, 41-0.</p>
        <p>After a scoreless opening period, the swirling winds at Yale Bowl took a toll on Columbia's kicking game. Successive punts by the Lions' Ryan Kiernan were blown back about 20 yards, positioning Yale (6-1 over all, 3-1 Ivy League) inside the Columbia 30-yard line. Both times, Lee connected on scoring passes, the first for 24 yards to Eric Johnson and the second for 2 yards to Jeff Ditman to give Yale a 13-0 lead midway through the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Johnson, a senior who holds Yale records for career receiving yardage and receptions, caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Lee to complete a 67-yard drive in the third quarter. Lee and Johnson connected for a third touchdown from 17 yards early in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>LoProto, a junior, intercepted a Jeff McCall pass and returned it 67 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, LoProto became the first Yale player to return two interceptions for touchdowns in the same game with a 17-yard return of a Steve Hunsberger pass.</p>
        <p>Jack Siedlecki, in his fourth year as the Yale coach, was understandably pleased as his team remained in a four-way tie for first place in the Ivy League with Penn, Harvard and Cornell.</p>
        <p>''Everything went our way,'' he said. ''The defense was emotionally charged up, especially when Columbia got close.''</p>
        <p>The Yale defense twice thwarted Columbia drives inside the Eli 10-yard line in the second half.</p>
        <p>Yale's outstanding halfback, Rashad Bartholomew, did not play because of an ankle injury. But his backup, the sophomore Jay Schulze, was the game's leading ground gainer with 128 yards on 21 carries.</p>
        <p>Columbia's Johnathan Reese, who ran 19 times for 86 yards, broke the school's career rushing record, 1,992 yards, set by the all-American Lou Kusserow from 1945 through 1948, and became the first Columbia running back to surpass 1,000 yards rushing in a season. Reese, a junior tailback who ran for a school-record 236 yards and 4 touchdowns in last week's victory over Dartmouth, has 2,076 yards for his career.</p>
        <p>Shaken up while blocking on a Yale kickoff early in the second quarter, Reese missed the rest of that period and did not play in the last quarter.</p>
        <p>''I didn't see any point in using Johnathan in the end, especially after he apparently had suffered a concussion earlier,'' said Coach Ray Tellier of Columbia (3-4, 1-3).</p>
        <p>Despite the wind, Lee completed 15 of 20 passes for 164 yards and 4 touchdowns and was not intercepted.</p>
        <p>McCall connected on 10 of 21 passes for 62 yards for Columbia; his backups, Hunsberger and Mark Stoutenberg, combined to complete 5 of 18 passes for 38 yards.</p>
        <p>''We made far too many mistakes,'' said Tellier, who is from nearby West Haven. ''They executed well, and we did the opposite. We made a good Division I-AA team look like the best Division I-AA team in the country. It was embarrassing.''</p>
        <p>Every time the Lions got close, the Yale defense, led by the captain Peter Mazza, who had 11 tackles today, stiffened.</p>
        <p>On Columbia's first possession, the Lions reached the Yale 28 before flanker Jarel Cockburn fumbled after he had caught a pass at the Eli 25; Mazza recovered the ball.</p>
        <p>In the second half, Columbia drove to the Yale 9, but a fourth-down pass was batted down. On a drive to the Yale 6, a fourth-down pass was completed short of a first down.</p>
        <p>For the Lions, who had scored more than 40 points in each of their three victories this season, that was as close to the Yale goal line as they would come.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Yale has four transfers on its squad, including the starters RASHAD BARTHOLOMEW (Air Force), PETER LEE (Wisconsin) and the 6-foot-3 defensive back THAN MERRILL (Stanford), Merrill was a first-team all-Ivy League selection last year.</p>
