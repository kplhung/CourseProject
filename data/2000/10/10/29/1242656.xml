        <p>THE Communist Party of China is like the bright sun,'' sang Granny Sha, her face glowing through wrinkles of sorrow as she told of abuse at the hands of a ''poisonous snake, bloodsucker'' landlord in Kuomintang-ruled China. Her words, soaring and elongated in the lyrical gymnastics of Beijing opera, were punctuated by a roar of applause from the audience in the Yifu Theater here. ''Without the party, my whole family would have been wiped out long ago,'' she concluded, joined by many audience members, spontaneously singing along.</p>
        <p>When the aria ended, Granny Sha beamed beatifically at a rosy-cheeked People's Liberation Army soldier, and the audience settled back to watch the crimes against her avenged in ''Shajiabang,'' the first of eight ''revolutionary model operas,'' which dominated China's stages, screens and airwaves to the virtual exclusion of all else during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976.</p>
        <p>But while the scene onstage closely resembled a Cultural Revolution-era performance, the audience members -- mostly middle-aged and stylishly dressed, casually taking cell-phone calls, slurping Cokes and licking ice cream bars as the opera proceeded -- were decidedly Shanghai 2000. Although the ostensible reason for mounting ''Shajiabang'' was the 55th anniversary of the victory over the Japanese in World War II, tying the performance to this occasion was merely an excuse, an imaginative means of forestalling criticism by the many Chinese intellectuals who think model operas should be relegated to the dustbin of history.</p>
        <p>The term ''model opera'' is a loose one, referring to two sets of ''model'' musical and theatrical works that include ballet, symphony and a reformed version of Beijing opera. As highly visible relics of an era that is officially condemned -- a 10-year period of chaos in which much of China's traditional culture was destroyed and countless artists and intellectuals were humiliated, tortured, jailed and killed -- model operas are understandably controversial. Condemnation of the Cultural Revolution is absolute not only because of the terror and havoc it wrought but also because this is the most effective means for the Communist Party to close the book on a chapter of its history that it would rather everyone forgot.</p>
        <p>Yet model operas, though inextricably linked to this tragic era, have become popular crowd pleasers and are performed with increasing regularity as the Cultural Revolution itself fades into the past. Unofficially forbidden in the immediate aftermath of the 10 years of chaos, model Beijing opera excerpts were first performed again in the late 1980's. The model ballets -- ''The Red Detachment of Women'' and ''The White-Haired Girl'' -- are now bread-and-butter repertory for the Central Ballet and the Shanghai Ballet, which often take them on the road and even perform them overseas.</p>
        <p>A revival of the model symphonies has lagged behind, because they are hard to present -- they include huge choruses, traditional Chinese instruments and Beijing opera singers -- and because classical musicians suffered so much during the Cultural Revolution that many virulently oppose them. But as old musicians retire, such opposition diminishes, and this fall the Shanghai Symphony and the Shanghai Radio Symphony are both devoting concerts to excerpts from model symphonies and ballet suites.</p>
        <p>AS the number of performances increases, so do attempts to analyze the artistic value of this genre created expressly to serve politics.</p>
        <p>''Naturally, this is sensitive,'' said Wang Renyuan, a Nanjing-based professor who wrote a book on the music in model operas. ''We oppose the Cultural Revolution now, so of course products from then are also criticized. But model operas were very special, and we can't just ignore them. If we say the Cultural Revolution was politics raping art, then we shouldn't still be doing this today. Criticize the Cultural Revolution, criticize Jiang Qing, but why can't we analyze model operas artistically?''</p>
        <p>Model operas were the brainchild of Jiang Qing, Mao Zedong's third wife, who became infamous as the leader of the Gang of Four, which in turn is blamed for most of the evils of the Cultural Revolution. Herself a former actress, Jiang was obsessed with the idea of creating a new form of proletarian art to replace traditional Western and Chinese performing arts like ballet, symphony and, especially, Beijing opera. She and her husband felt that Beijing opera perpetuated feudal bourgeois ideology with what Mao called ''kings and ministers, talented scholars and beautiful women, monsters and demons.'' Using her clout as Mao's wife, Jiang pushed for a new form of opera based on revolutionary themes.</p>
        <p>''It is inconceivable that in our socialist country, led by the Communist Party, the dominant position on the stage is not occupied by the workers, peasants and soldiers, who are the real creators of history and the true masters of our country,'' she wrote in a 1964 essay, ''On the Revolution of Beijing Opera.''</p>
        <p>Gathering many of the best talents in the country, she established model opera creation groups, which chose a story, then strove to weave her political and aesthetic ideals into it. These included a sense of the overarching importance of ''class struggle'' and her belief that there had been ''no good music written since the Internationale.'' Many of the operas that resulted were revised versions of pre-existing works, and revisions to these new models sometimes went on for years.</p>
        <p>''We had meetings every night: this part isn't right, that part isn't right,'' said the Beijing conductor Li Delun, one of China's most respected musicians, who participated in the creation groups for several model operas and conducted the symphonic version of ''Shajiabang'' many times. ''And we played every day. Every day we did 'Shajiabang.' I could conduct it upside down. Even the musicians could play it with their eyes closed. But we still had to rehearse. Then we'd have a big meeting, and people would give their ideas: who wasn't good enough, who hit a wrong note. After we made any change, Jiang Qing had to approve. But to tell the truth, she couldn't understand a thing.''</p>
        <p>On May 31, 1967, the work of Jiang and her creation groups was officially acknowledged in a People's Daily editorial: ''Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Jiang Qing has advanced bravely to participate in this performing-arts revolution. She has created, for the first time in history, eight shining-star models for Beijing opera, ballet and symphonic music. She has captured the most stubborn citadel of theater arts, Beijing opera; surmounted the highest peak of performing arts, ballet. And that of the most sacred 'pure music,' symphony.''</p>
        <p>The eight works singled out were two ballets, a symphony and five reformed Beijing operas. A second group of nine model operas was codified in 1973, though these were not as widely performed, and several were simply different versions of the original eight, like the symphonic rendition of the Beijing opera ''Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy.''</p>
        <p>Once selected, the first eight model operas were spread throughout the country by every means possible: taught over the radio, made into movies, shown on television and reworked for local opera forms. Model opera scores and production guides were distributed everywhere to ensure that each performance would be the same, down to a detail as seemingly inconsequential as the size and color of a patched cloth sack carried by a peasant in a fleeting stage appearance.</p>
        <p>''Turn on your television, model operas,'' said Professor Wang. ''Turn on your radio, model operas. Go to the movies, model operas. That's all you saw.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, they were so pervasive that almost any Chinese person over 40 can still sing famous arias from all the model operas, and many can recite every word of dialogue, sing every song and mimic every gesture. It is perhaps not surprising that a generation raised on model operas should enjoy watching them now and then, much the way middle-aged Americans listen to the rock music of their youth or sneak a peek at a ''Brady Bunch'' rerun. For these people, there is nothing at all controversial about model operas.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the audience for model operas is middle-aged people, the people who were teenagers during the Cultural Revolution,'' said Li Zhongcheng, the artistic director of the Beijing Opera Theater in Shanghai. ''All they saw were model operas, and they enjoy them.</p>
        <p>''But people look at model operas with rather complicated hearts. Everyone has his or her own opinions and feelings. There are those who were hurt during the Cultural Revolution, who were treated very cruelly. As soon as they hear the opening notes of a model opera, they remember everything bad that happened, and their hearts start to beat faster. These people are mostly older, and they never want to see or hear model operas again.''</p>
        <p>Young people who were not yet born during the Cultural Revolution, on the other hand, have no memory and little knowledge of model operas. ''Some young people aren't interested at all,'' Mr. Li said. ''They don't want to see any kind of Beijing opera. A few are curious about model operas, but they think the political parts are ridiculous. They laugh out loud.''</p>
        <p>Some artists who were alive during the Cultural Revolution are vocal in their views. ''This group splits in two,'' Mr. Li said. ''Those who were hurt in the Cultural Revolution think model operas are bad -- they destroyed our traditions -- and they oppose performing them. But more people disagree. They think that if you can separate out the politics, model operas are a kind of artistic experiment. So many talented people worked on model operas, and many say we'll never match that quality again.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, model operas are a classic if extreme example of East-West artistic fusion, and though the committee process by which they were created is now criticized, it had roots in the informal, open-ended collaborative process by which traditional Chinese opera has always been made.</p>
        <p>Despite this diversity of opinion, model operas are in enough demand that they have become a source of revenue for the few companies with the resources to stage the comparatively large-scale productions. And just as orchestras and ballet and Beijing opera companies continue to perform model operas, scholars persist in efforts to study them dispassionately.</p>
        <p>The works of a Beijing-based professor, Dai Jiafang, who focused on the role of Yu Huirong, a talented composer close to Jiang who became Minister of Culture, then committed suicide when the Gang of Four was overthrown, have been banned. Professor Wang's book did not face such problems, because it avoids politics and concentrates on the music in model operas, which is widely acknowledged to be their strong point even by those who never want to hear one again. Pointing to the number of outstanding performers and composers involved in the creation of model operas, Professor Wang argues that they helped raise the quality of Beijing opera music by giving greater prominence to the instruments, which had long been overshadowed by the voice.</p>
        <p>Indeed, though experiments in adding Western instruments to traditional opera had begun many years earlier, these were piecemeal until model operas came along. Jiang wanted Western instruments because she thought they made Beijing opera music sound more ''heroic,'' but she was picky about balance between voice and instrumental music, and between Chinese and Western instruments. In her quest for the perfect instrumentation, she banned the tuba and limited the number of trombones to two.</p>
        <p>Percussion instruments are an important part of traditional Beijing opera, but Jiang felt that they overpowered other instruments, and had them confined in a ''pigeon cage,'' a small, sound-absorbing structure built into the orchestra pit. She even ordered that the gongs and cymbals be made with a new metal alloy that was supposed to temper their sound. To make the music more dramatic, the creation groups borrowed from Western opera the concepts of overture, interlude and melodrama, and the use of melodic and rhythmic motifs to identify different characters.</p>
        <p>Yet while some critics grudgingly admit that Jiang made a contribution to musical development, if mainly because she had a tyrant's power to attract the best talents and enforce the most rigorous quality standards, others note that almost nothing she did was original and that the threat of severe punishment was hardly a laudable means to give artists incentive. And most are quick to suggest that everything she did was driven not by a genuine love of music but by her own personal political agenda.</p>
        <p>''It was all a power struggle, all politics,'' said Li Delun, the Beijing conductor. ''Jiang Qing just used music. She hadn't done anything important. She had no political standing, so she decided she'd do a Cultural Revolution. There was no proletarian art in the world, so she took Beijing opera and classical music and put them together. We were all used by her, to give her something to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Li's words are echoed by Luo Zheng rong, a composer who took part in the ''Shajiabang'' creation group. ''The influence of model operas isn't only political, but the purpose of creating them was,'' Mr. Luo said. ''The control was hateful, laughable. But it's just opera now. And some of the music is good. Art is art, especially compared to today's sloppy compositions.''</p>
        <p>While many critics are willing to give model opera music the benefit of the doubt, even enthusiasts acknowledge that when it comes to other aspects of the genre, particularly plot and characterization, there is little good to say, apart from the apparent appeal of these stories to lovers of moral tales and melodramas. As a political work, each opera was required to be politically correct, to exemplify class struggle and to put forward heroic characters.</p>
        <p>What resulted were highly cliched dramas devoid of human emotion, in which white knights of the Communist Party battle and ultimately defeat evil, whether oppressive landlords, Japanese soldiers, Kuomintang bandits or petty-bourgeois capitalists. Heroic characters have no faults or weaknesses and evil characters no redeeming qualities. Characters who might be expected to fall in love forgo romance in favor of ''comradely relations'' and ''class love,'' and no one in a model opera has a visible husband or wife.</p>
        <p>Every opportunity is taken to underline political themes. When Mao's name is mentioned, lightning flashes; when a landlord or a Japanese person appears, he walks buffoonishly or makes absurd faces. Heroes sing beautiful arias and evil characters ugly ones. In theatrical performances, the actors who played evil characters even had their names listed at the bottom of the program, separated by several inches from the good characters; in movies, they were filmed in virtual black-and-white, while the hero was bathed in light.</p>
        <p>So political are the operas that only those set before 1949 -- when the enemies were landlords, the Japanese and the Kuomintang -- are still performed. In those set in post-1949 China, like ''On the Docks'' and ''Longjiangsong,'' the action centers on ferreting out ''class enemies,'' a category that essentially includes anyone whose parents weren't peasants, workers or soldiers.</p>
        <p>''We don't perform 'On the Docks' or 'Longjiangsong,' '' said Li Zhongcheng, of the Beijing Opera Theater in Shanghai. ''They hurt us. They hurt the audience. They're too leftist.''</p>
        <p>But interestingly, efforts to soften the politicized plots -- like the Shanghai company's attempt to change one offensively leftist line in ''Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy'' -- have met with scorn.</p>
        <p>''The audience laughed so much, the actors wouldn't sing the new words anymore,'' Mr. Li said. ''It happened everywhere we performed.'' Since Mr. Li himself argues that the right to perform model operas is a kind of artistic freedom, he couldn't very well ignore the demands of his audience. ''Leftist or not, the audience wants to hear the old words,'' he said. ''So now we sing the old words again.''</p>
        <p>Most intellectuals, even those who detest the genre, are similarly willing to concede that if people want to watch model operas, they should have that right.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to watch them,'' said Mr. Luo, the composer. ''I don't want to hear them. But they were created well, and if they didn't have a political purpose, they wouldn't exist. The fact is, there's a market for them. If there wasn't a market, they wouldn't be performed.''</p>
