        <p>With the cold war won and Wall Street on a winning streak, America's interest in Europe has waned. Yet it has been a convulsive decade. Violence took more European lives in the 1990's than in the entire 44-year period of the cold war. Several post-Communist societies muddled their way toward democracy and the market economy. Another, Yugoslavia, fissured in a blood bath. The wars of its destruction may finally have ended with the ouster this month of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's ruthless leader. Saying goodbye and good riddance to the full exercise of their sovereignty, several West European states created a common currency, the euro. The thinly-veiled political objective behind the money could scarcely have been bolder: the forging, one day, of a United States of Europe.</p>
        <p>These are the weighty themes of Timothy Garton Ash's ''History of the Present,'' a collection of essays and dispatches from one the most penetrating observers of Europe's recent transformation. A rather self-conscious introduction announces that the author has sought to combine ''the crafts of historian and journalist,'' an objective that in lesser hands might merely have yielded mediocre illustrations of both. But Garton Ash has the wherewithal for his ambitious genre. His strongest pieces combine a quick eye, a gift for concision and an ability to discern the deep currents of history in the restless waters of the present. Pith, prescience and intellectual passion often coalesce to provide a powerful European portrait.</p>
        <p>The essays in Garton Ash's book, most of them previously published, form what he calls a kaleidoscope. At times, the patterns are vivid, the images brilliantly illuminating. At others, the fragments are disjointed or simply repetitive. We hear not once but twice from the anonymous French businessman who comments acidly that expansion of the European Union to include post-Communist central Europe should always be talked about but never considered. The term ''demokratura,'' used to describe an authoritarian regime dressed up in the garb of democracy, returns with irritating frequency to characterize governments as different as Milosevic's murderous Serbia and Vladimir Meciar's messy Slovakia. And the eviction of ''innocent'' Germans from Eastern Europe after the end of Hitler's terror appears to be something of an obsession.</p>
        <p>But when Garton Ash, a fellow of St. Antony's College, Oxford, explores his favorite themes, the results are often formidable. Two of the most important essays are ''Catching the Wrong Bus?'' and ''The Case for Liberal Order.'' In them, he argues that European leaders made a cardinal error a decade ago by setting monetary union in the western part of the continent as their chief political priority. That priority should have been the swift integration of post-Communist countries into the democratic order of the European Union: ''They put Maastricht before Sarajevo,'' he writes, referring to the Dutch city where the treaty on the euro was agreed to in 1991.</p>
        <p>His case is compelling, and impressive for the cogent consistency with which he has argued it since the Berlin Wall fell. No post-Communist state has joined the European Union; dates for entry keep getting postponed. Meanwhile, monetary union -- decided in haste and on high in order to tie a reunited Germany to an integrated Europe -- is suffering from its largely undemocratic conception and from the absence of a coherent, broadly acceptable political project to accompany it. Hence, in part, the weakness of the euro, which has lost 25 percent of its value in 21 months. A European money probably needs a European government to administer it; but not enough Europeans want such a goverment, at least not now.</p>
        <p>As a result, Garton Ash is deeply suspicious of what he sees as a drive to push Europeans toward more union than they want. His is a conservative Atlanticism, that of a British intellectual deeply engaged in Europe, enraged by the myopia of so many Little Englanders, but still suspicious of too much centralizing idealism on a Continent so ravaged, still convinced that avoidance of the worst is a worthy goal.</p>
        <p>Disaster, he suggests, is not impossible. Germans, who have abandoned the much-loved symbol of their postwar nationhood, the mark, may come to view the euro as another Versailles. A ''serious danger'' exists that the French-German ''magnetic core'' of an integrating Europe could come to exert ''magnetic repulsion.'' In a Continent now marked by the rise of populist, rightist politicians like Jorg Haider in Austria, and increasingly wary of the notion of a European ''superstate,'' such warnings are hard to ignore. But the political investment in the euro is probably too great, and the ultimate American interest in a stable Europe too keen, for an implosion to come to pass.</p>
        <p>In its southeastern Balkan corner, Europe has already had its share of cataclysms in the past decade. Garton Ash backs into the story in the strangest of ways, with an account of the expulsion of the Serbs by a resurgent Croatian Army in 1995. This is a bit like beginning an account of World War II with the story of those Sudeten Germans ethnically cleansed after 1945. He refers to this expulsion more than once as ''the biggest single exodus'' of the Bosnian war. In fact, that dubious accolade belongs to the more than 750,000 Muslims driven out by the Serbs as they swept through Bosnia in the first months of the war in 1992. This exodus was also the result of one devastating, coordinated sweep. Yet the Serbian concentration camps through which many of the Muslims were processed merit not a mention.</p>
        <p>This lacuna is doubly strange because Garton Ash gets so much right. ''Hitler,'' he writes, ''should have been stopped when he remilitarized the Rhineland in 1936; Milosevic at the siege of Vukovar in 1991.'' Indeed. And his critique of the no-body-bags approach of Bill Clinton and the Pentagon in Bosnia and later Kosovo is superb: ''It is a perverted moral code that will allow a million innocent civilians of another race to be made destitute because you are not prepared to risk the life of a single professional soldier of your own.'' As Garton Ash explains, thousands of ethnic Albanian lives were sacrificed in 1999 because there was no readiness to accompany the NATO bombardment of Kosovo with the deployment of a ground force that could stop the marauding Serbian killers. Years before that, the dismemberment of Bosnia went as far as it did because of similar hesitations. For President Clinton to claim Bosnia as a success story, as he has often done since 1995, is simply extraordinary. Garton Ash now sees little alternative to allowing ethnic separation to be completed in the Balkans, a process that he hopes will eventually open the way for their reintegration. This, he suggests, is the European way; to fight it is to try ''to freeze history.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the United States and its allies are trying to prove him wrong by preserving some semblance of mixed societies in Bosnia and even Kosovo. In Bosnia, they may succeed because they have something to build on; Garton Ash underestimates the reality of a Bosnian identity even among many Serbs there. In Kosovo, however, any meaningful multiethnic project is almost surely doomed at this stage. Meanwhile, with Garton Ash, we are left to rue the painful fact that ''the democratization of Yugoslavia, and of Bosnia in particular, would, had it worked, have been a unique example of a part of Europe moving peacefully from a truly multiethnic society under an undemocratic (imperial, then Communist) political roof to such a society within a democratic framework.''</p>
        <p>It is this sort of perception, and writing, that makes ''History of the Present'' essential reading. Garton Ash sometimes seems unsure of his role, assuming a highhanded pomposity that makes certain passages read like a ''History of My Presence.'' He is often scathing toward journalists, dismissing their ''color,'' their ''cliches'' and their ''Sarajevo safaris,'' and suggesting that CNN and Christiane Amanpour play fast and loose with the truth. Yet this is the craft he claims to be practicing, at least in part, and the role of journalists in the Balkans -- not least the discovery of the camps in Bosnia in 1992 -- has surely done more honor to the profession than damage.</p>
        <p>At the start of his book, throwing in the towel on his convoluted attempts to define history-cum-journalism, Garton Ash writes that the final test must be this: ''Is the result true, important, interesting or moving? If it is, never mind the label. If it isn't, then it's not worth reading anyway.'' So let us apply the test. True? Most of the time. Important? Sometimes. Interesting? Always. Moving? Surprisingly so.</p>
