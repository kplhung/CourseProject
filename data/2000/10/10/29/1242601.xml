        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed John Sutherland's review of ''Quarrel &amp; Quandary'' (Oct. 8), Cynthia Ozick's book of essays, except for a sentence reporting her educational background. Sutherland states, ''She was lucky enough to attend New York's P.S. 71 at a time when the city's high schools were educational powerhouses for the upwardly mobile.''</p>
        <p>P.S. 71 is an elementary school, not a high school. Ozick attended Hunter College High School, one of the city's most prestigious schools.</p>
