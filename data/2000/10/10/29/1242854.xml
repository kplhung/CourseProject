        <p>Bruce Springsteen, who brought worldwide fame to the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, wrote a song called ''The Light of Day,'' which was used in a Joan Jett-Michael J. Fox movie of the same name.</p>
        <p>Now the song with its hope-filled lyrics is the theme for a concert Friday at the Stone Pony to raise money for the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. The event is being organized by  Bob Benjamin, a rock band manager whose Parkinson's was diagnosed four years ago; the disease also affects Mr. Fox, the actor.</p>
        <p>Joe Grushecky and The House rockers, Samhill, Joe D'Urso and Stone Caravan, Boccigalupe and the Bad Boys, and the Danny White Band are among the performers. Mr. Grushecky, a friend of Mr. Springsteen's, recorded ''Light of Day'' and frequently performs it in concert.</p>
        <p>''Just around the corner to the light of day'' is not only a line from the song, it is also the theme for the concert and the way Mr. Benjamin, manager for Mr. Grushecky and Mr. D'Urso, describes the state of research into the cause and possible cure of Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.</p>
