        <p>An application to build a video arcade opposite Booker T. Washington Junior High School, on West 107th Street, is not scoring points with local residents, who would like to zap the arcade as a major distraction and neighborhood nuisance.

        <p>An application to build a video arcade opposite Booker T. Washington Junior High School, on West 107th Street, is not scoring points with local residents, who would like to zap the arcade as a major distraction and neighborhood nuisance. A committee of Community Board 7 has already voted against the application by Mireybi Vega Game Room to the Department of Consumer Affairs.</p>
        <p>The location of the proposed arcade -- the basement of an apartment building now occupied by an informal social club -- has been associated with drug dealing and prostitution, according to the local Business Improvement District.</p>
        <p>''We can only assume, given what's already there, that the whole thing is problematic,'' said Melanie Radley, co-chairwoman of the board's uniformed services committee.</p>
        <p>Under city regulations, a video arcade cannot be located within 200 feet of a public school. The opposition of community boards and the labyrinth of regulations foils all but the best-organized and connected applicants, according to people in the industry. Most of the city's arcades are in Times Square and Coney Island.</p>
        <p>Even as resistance builds to an arcade on West 107th Street, one entrepreneur a few blocks away has discovered a way to get around the city's complex licensing process.</p>
        <p>At Cybergames, a small store on Broadway near 102nd Street, a sleeker version of the old arcade has been born. By connecting home systems like Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcaster to a television set and a counter that charges by the hour, Cybergames has attracted a steady flow of customers, mostly youngsters stopping by after school. Because the games are not considered arcade machines, the store can exceed the limit of four units without obtaining a license.</p>
        <p>The idea has proved so popular, a similar store, called Game Room, opened a year ago on West 99th Street.</p>
        <p>The stores neither look nor sound like traditional arcades, which are typically dark and noisy hangouts for teenagers. At Cybergames, children as young as 5 sit surrounded by siblings, friends, baby sitters and parents, all under the watchful gaze of the owner, Danny Ahn, and his employees.</p>
        <p>''The main reason the city requires a license is because arcades pull in bad traffic,'' Mr. Ahn said. By contrast, Cybergames offers constant supervision of children.</p>
        <p>''And believe me, kids are crazy about games,'' Mr. Ahn said. ''If I tell them to shut up, they will shut up.''</p>
