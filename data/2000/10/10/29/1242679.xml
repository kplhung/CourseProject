        <p>IN suburbia, grass is the consumate symbol of suburban life. But elsewhere in the world, grasses represent an important food source.</p>
        <p>''Without rice, wheat, corn, oats, barley and rye -- all grasses, there would be no cereal for breakfast, pasta for lunch or nachos to snack on,'' said Penny Low, curator of the exhibit ''Grasses for the Masses,'' at the International Paper Greenhouse in Stamford.</p>
        <p>''And that's not all,'' said Ms. Low, who has a master's degree in environmental studies from the Yale's School of Forestry. ''Since the days of the cavemen, the stems and leaves of grass have been used for clothing and building. Even today bamboo is used to make everything from ship masts to furniture.''</p>
        <p>While guiding school groups through the exhibit, she says: ''I start off asking the children whether they've had any grass for breakfast. 'Oh no,' they chuckle. Yet almost all, it turns out, had bagels, waffles or cereal.''</p>
        <p>Exotic background music from a Tibetan bamboo flute entices visitors into the greenhouse atmosphere for an introduction to the grass family. Made up of more than 9,000 species, it's considered one of the world's largest, most hardy flowering plant families.</p>
        <p>''They grow on every continent, adapting to conditions from the frozen north to the tropics, from deserts to marshes,'' Ms. Low said.</p>
        <p>Rice, one of the water grasses, is grown in most parts of the world. The ground seeds of wheat, believed grown as food for 10,000 years, are a major ingredient in breads, breakfast cereals and many other products. Wheat is second to rice as the most important food-producing grass in the world.</p>
        <p>Corn, grown by the Mayas, Aztecs and Incas, as well as Native Americans at the time the early settlers came, is an essential food for livestock. It offers other uses as well with both plant and grain used in industrial processes. And so it goes with oats, barley and rye, all illustrated and explained, as is sugar cane -- one of the bigger hits with the children.</p>
        <p>''Two thirds of the sugar we eat,'' Ms. Low explained, ''comes from the crushed, boiled and crystalized solid stems of this plant.''</p>
        <p>Almost an aside, Ms. Low said, ''And yes, grasses are very attractive as lawns and parks, and more and more grasses are ornamental.'' She pointed out an ornamental grouping displayed in a long wood tub, like a mini all-grass garden, showing off different shapes, colors, heights and flower heads. Little Bunny Fountain, for example, offers creamy white flower spikes, and the unusual Dwarf Pampas Grass showy feather white plumes.</p>
        <p>The Greenhouse at International Paper, 400 Atlantic Street (corner of Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard) in downtown Stamford is open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.</p>
        <p>The exhibit runs through Nov. 11. There is no charge. Information: (203) 358-6533.</p>
