        <p>A STAR-STUDDED revival of Gore Vidal's 1960 stage comedy aobut a presidential convention opened at the Virginia Theater last month to some lovely reviews. The movie version of THE BEST MAN (1964), directed by Franklin Schaffner, has won its share of praise, too. Henry Fonda is the good guy, an intellectual liberal with integrity. Cliff Robertson is the bad guy, an ultraconservative Communist-hunting ''man of the people'' who will sink to any depth for votes and endorsements. One of these men is going to win the nomination. Mr. Vidal's screenplay is witty, literate and deadly, which is no surprise. But it is a little jolting to see how the game of politics was so completely a man's world 40 years ago. The actresses in the film (Margaret Leighton, Ann Sothern, Edie Adams) are fine, but their characters are memorable mostly for their hairstyles. A lot of French twists - Friday at 10 p.m. on TCM.</p>

        <p>A STAR-STUDDED revival of Gore Vidal's 1960 stage comedy aobut a presidential convention opened at the Virginia Theater last month to some lovely reviews. The movie version of THE BEST MAN (1964), directed by Franklin Schaffner, has won its share of praise, too. Henry Fonda is the good guy, an intellectual liberal with integrity. Cliff Robertson is the bad guy, an ultraconservative Communist-hunting ''man of the people'' who will sink to any depth for votes and endorsements. One of these men is going to win the nomination. Mr. Vidal's screenplay is witty, literate and deadly, which is no surprise. But it is a little jolting to see how the game of politics was so completely a man's world 40 years ago. The actresses in the film (Margaret Leighton, Ann Sothern, Edie Adams) are fine, but their characters are memorable mostly for their hairstyles. A lot of French twists - Friday at 10 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>John Travolta plays a Southern governor who can charm his way out of anything in Mike Nichol's PRIMARY COLORS (1998), a grossly underappreciated satire about a presidential candidate who's supposed to seem awfully familiar. Emma Thompson is perfection as his savvy, appealingly foulmouthed wife and oplitical partner. And Kathy Bates is nothing short of brilliant as the take-charge campaign consultant with a history of nervous breakdowns. Under her bravado beats an idealist's heart, which turns out to be all too fragile - Friday at 8 and 11 p.m. and Saturday at 11 p.m. on TNT.</p>
        <p>Between ''Raise the Red Lantern'' and ''To Live,'' Zhang Yimou made THE STORY OF QIU JU (1992). The usually glamorous Gong Li, Mr. Zhang's longtime muse, plays this role bundled up in peasant clothes and considerably pregnant (or just looking it). She's a farm wife whose husband has been kicked in the groin by the leader of their village, and she's determined to get justice for this offense - even if that menas going to the Chinese equivalent of the Supreme Court. Sometimes the simplest quests make for remarkable drama - Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on IFC.</p>
        <p>Christopher Guest's pseudodocumentary about dignified show dogs and their deranged owners, ''Best in Show,'' is a box office hit this fall. But his last film in the same genre, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN (1996), is just as funny Mr. Guest plays the ebullient Corky St. Clair, a small-town Missouri amateur theater director, preparing a sesquicentennial show. A really dreadful one. Then word arrives that a major theater critic is planning to attend, and serious excitement ensues. Many members of the usual Guest ensemble are in the company: Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and Parker Posey among them - Wednseday at 7:35 p.m. on TMC.</p>
        <p>Scary movies are a dime a dozen this Halloween week, but the original, the one that influenced all the rest, if FRANKENSTEIN (1931). It made Boris Karloff, then 44, a star (after 15 years of forget-table character-actor movie roles). Colin Clive plays the quintessential mad doctor of the title and Karloff is, of course, the monster he creates from spare human parts and brings to life. Unfortunately the doctor uses a criminal's brain. And the big guy, who is misunderstood by everybody, doesn't know his owns strength. The director was James Whale, the man Sir Ian McKellen brought so vividly and sympathetically to life two years ago in the film ''Gods and Monsters.'' This 69-year-old film shows its age, but it's wonderfully gothic - Monday/Early Tuesday at 5:15 a.m., Tuesday at 9 p.m. and Tuesday/Early Wednesday at 5 a.m. on AMC.</p>
