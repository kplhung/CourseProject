        <p>A new city law requires yellow school buses to provide a seat for every public school student. Now, Amalgamated Transit Local 726, a union of about 100 Staten Island city bus drivers, is calling on the Transit Authority to guarantee seats for public and private school students who ride regular city buses.</p>
        <p>''Why should there be a different standard for kids using city buses?'' said Larry Hanley, the union president. ''It's a very dangerous situation.''</p>
        <p>Michael Stein, a paramedic from Arden Heights whose 16-year-old son Daniel takes city buses to and from school, agreed. ''I think it clearly would make it safer,'' he said. ''If it causes them to have more buses to do it, so be it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanley added that the new law, which took effect this school year, has made the Board of Education more vigilant in keeping unqualified students off yellow school buses. That effort, in turn, has prompted more students to take city buses. Hence, the overcrowding.</p>
        <p>The union effort, dubbed ''Precious Cargo,'' has picked up support from two transit advocacy groups, the Straphangers Campaign and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign.</p>
        <p>But it is not being warmly received by the Transit Authority. Al O'Leary, a spokesman, said Mr. Hanley's real agenda was to create more jobs for bus drivers. ''The union is very skilled at taking issues that serve the union, like getting more bus drivers and union dues, and making it look like it's their concern about the student ridership,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He added that city buses serving Staten Island had 40 seats but were designed to carry an additional 30 standing passengers when schools let out and during other peak periods.  ''Mass transit service moves as many people as it can in the most efficient way,'' he said. ''Standees are part of that service, so students shouldn't be surprised if they don't always get a seat.''</p>
        <p>City Councilman Stephen J. Fiala, who represents the South Shore of Staten Island and who was the author of the school bus bill, said he agreed with the intent of the union but would hesitate to require a seat for each student who took a city bus. He said he was worried about other passengers who would be left at the curb if a bus was already full, as such a law would require. ''I'm not sure practically it would work,'' he said.</p>
