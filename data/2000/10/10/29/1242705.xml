        <p>ONE day earlier this month the supply of the state's most common blood type, O positive, dropped to less than a day's reserve. The ''safe level'' is considered three days' supply by hospitals and the American Red Cross.</p>
        <p>So far, no surgeries have been postponed in any Connecticut hospital because of the shortage, but if the situation continues the Red Cross and the Connecticut Hospital Association said elective surgeries would have to be delayed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward Snyder, director of Yale-New Haven Hospital's blood bank, said the blood shortage is not an emergency yet, but, he said, ''Spot shortages are becoming more common.'' He said one temporary solution might be to give a patient fewer units of blood than has been the norm for some procedures.</p>
        <p>Typically, the state's hospitals request a total of about 600 units of blood a day, the Red Cross said, but statewide donations have run at about 520 a day. Often, the Red Cross makes up the difference by bringing in blood from out of state.</p>
        <p>The problem is the result of both fewer donors and a growing need for the blood. Five percent of eligible donors in Connecticut -- those who are more than 17 years old, weigh at least 110 pounds and are generally healthy -- give blood, for a donor base of 90,000.</p>
        <p>Adding to the problem are two recent health restrictions that have together eliminated 4 percent of the donor base, or a total of 3,600 people, said Lynn Townshend, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Region Blood Services of the American Red Cross. One restriction is on people who have spent a cumulative six months in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996. The fear is of mad cow, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob, disease The other concern is for the protection of some donors, mostly women, who are at risk of anemia if they give blood.</p>
        <p>Ms. Townshend said the strike in May of Red Cross blood collection staff had no impact on the current shortage. Since red blood cells have a 42-day shelf life, this shortage dates from September. She called a blood drive in July ''fabulously good,'' but one last month not as productive.</p>
        <p>She said the Red Cross plans to combat the shortage by invigorating its efforts to get schools, workplaces, churches and civic groups to hold blood drives where they can sign up at least 15 people. ''We are looking at longer-term strategies than just going to the media every six weeks,'' she said. ''When my neighbor asks me to give blood, it's more effective than when I go on TV and ask the whole state.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Townshend said donated blood is brought to the state Red Cross blood services headquarters in Farmington, then sent out to be typed and tested, a process that takes two days. She noted that a new form of testing for H.I.V. reduces the window from infection to detection to just 11 days -- down from six months at the start of the AIDS epidemic. That makes contaminated blood ''a rare, rare possibility,'' she said. ''Here in Connecticut we detect two to four contaminated units of blood each year, which are then destroyed.''</p>
        <p>Sheila Robida, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Hospital Association, said almost all the state's 31 hospitals had more patients than normal over the summer and into early fall, including more older patients and those needing organ transplants, thus increasing the need for blood. She added that although no hospitals have yet had to cancel elective surgeries, the Red Cross is releasing certain blood types on a ''transfuse only'' basis, when the hospital requests a specific type of blood.</p>
        <p>''It's always a tenuous situation,'' Ms. Robida said, ''because we rely solely on the Red Cross to supply blood and they rely solely on volunteers.''</p>
        <p>The blood shortage is not limited to Connecticut. In fact, the American Red Cross launched national appeals in both July and September, said Sarah Evers, national Red Cross spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The blood supply usually dips in the summer and around the winter holidays, Ms. Evers said.</p>
        <p>''People are on vacation or have other things to do,'' she said. ''Businesses are less likely to sponsor blood drives at that time, and schools are on vacation, which limits our access to high school and college students.'' For some reason that nobody seems to understand, the shortage has continued into the fall.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rebecca Haley, interim chief medical officer for the American Red Cross, said that advances in surgical methods require the use of more blood, further straining supply.</p>
        <p>Another difficulty, she added, is that workplaces have changed over the years, from massive factories where thousands of workers could be reached over a weeklong blood drive to more decentralized offices.</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Haley said that, nationally, blood collections actually increased 3 percent in the past year over the previous year, but that demand was up 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Haley said that a change in federal guidelines governing blood donations could help ease the shortage. She said some of the guidelines haven't been updated since the 1960's. She said there is one recommendation to change the rule on hepatitis to reflect that a history of the illness need no longer mean a life-time ban from donating. She said there also has been ''a tremendous amount of discussion'' on the ban on donations by sexually active gay men, which is aimed at minimizing the risk of getting a donation that is infected with H.I.V.</p>
        <p>She said that if those restrictions were eased and gay men gave at the same rate as the general population, that would increase the donor base by 70,000 nationally. However, she said the Centers for Disease Control, using 1994 data, estimated that such a move would introduce 1,200 cases of H.I.V. into the blood supply from men who were H.I.V. positive and didn't know it. That compares to the 850 H.I.V. positive blood donations nationally that are currently detected and destroyed.</p>
        <p>Because that data was old, Dr. Haley said, the Food and Drug Administration asked the C.D.C. to do a new study of the issue.</p>
        <p>John Allen, a gay community leader from New Haven, filed a complaint in 1993 with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities over the exclusion of sexually active gay men from the donor base, claiming it was discriminatory.</p>
        <p>''It demonizes gay people,'' he said. ''Prior to AIDS, gay people used to go in together to donate blood, as a community effort.''</p>
