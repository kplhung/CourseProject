        <p>FROM a tiny basement in a Newington apartment complex, two Russian women, Natella Abdulaeva and Lena Danilova, have spent a frenzied two months creating the outfits worn by some of the world's most famous ice skaters.</p>
        <p>Why Newington? Last June, the coach Tatyana Tarasova relocated to the Connecticut International Skating Center from southern New Jersey and brought 13 world-class skaters with her. Among them is Aleksei Yagudin, 20, the reigning three-time world men's champion. Others include the professional ice-dance champions Maya Usova and Yevgeny Platov, who have two silver and two gold Olympic medals between them.</p>

        <p>FROM a tiny basement in a Newington apartment complex, two Russian women, Natella Abdulaeva and Lena Danilova, have spent a frenzied two months creating the outfits worn by some of the world's most famous ice skaters.</p>
        <p>Why Newington? Last June, the coach Tatyana Tarasova relocated to the Connecticut International Skating Center from southern New Jersey and brought 13 world-class skaters with her. Among them is Aleksei Yagudin, 20, the reigning three-time world men's champion. Others include the professional ice-dance champions Maya Usova and Yevgeny Platov, who have two silver and two gold Olympic medals between them.</p>
        <p>On a September morning, one of the two rinks at the complex in Newington was pulsating with the  rhythm of Sting's ''Desert Rose.'' On the ice, Ms. Usova and Mr. Platov, who are in their 30's, rehearsed their sensuous routine, she the rose and he the sheik. Watching intently from the box usually occupied by hockey teams was Ms. Tarasova. The coach would occasionally emit a count or comment -- sometimes in English, sometimes in Russian, sometimes both. Practicing on the same rink for only their second season of world competitions was the ice-dancing team that skates for Belarus, 20-year-old Alexander Malkov and Alissa de Carbonnel, a 16-year-old from Darien.</p>
        <p>More quietly observing the athletes was the costume designer, Ms. Abdulaeva, sketching, taking note of the skaters' gestures, the line of the extended arm or leg, the fluidity. There is a story to be told in the music, the dance and the costumes.</p>
        <p>''Music, choreography and costume, and physical condition go together,'' Ms. Tarasova said. Costume is part of music. I am so happy to work with Natella. For me, she is the best designer in the world.''</p>
        <p>The subject of the praise quietly sketched as the skaters twirled and glided around the rink. Decades ago, when she was a young ballerina, Ms. Abdulaeva broke her knee. During her recovery, she said, she painted every day. She designed her first costume in art school, and from then on designed for ballet, theater and opera companies.</p>
        <p>''I look at the program to get ideas,'' she said. Then, she discusses her ideas with Ms. Tarasova and draws a few preliminary sketches.</p>
        <p>She is working on 30 different costumes. There are so many to be done, Ms. Danilova, the seamstress, cannot handle all the work, so some are sewn by another workroom in Hamden called Bustles &amp; Breeches. Ms. Abdulaeva personally selects the fabrics in New York City. A costume costs $500 to $1,400.</p>
        <p>Ice dancers usually need up to 12 costumes each to get through a season. All of Ms. Tarasova's skaters are preparing for the World Figure Skating Championship in Vancouver in March. (Practice sessions are also observed by the judges, so one has to dress to impress.)</p>
        <p>For Mr. Yagudin, Ms. Abdulaeva has designed a Quasimodo, two different gladiator outfits (one for competition, one for show), and a samurai.</p>
        <p>For the Quasimodo costume, actually three outfits in one, Mr. Yagudin begins as the disfigured hunchback complete with a gray hump. That tears away to reveal a black outfit, which in turn tears away to expose a blue chiffon-like fabric, reflecting the inner state of mind of Quasimodo in love.</p>
        <p>''Like a butterfly,'' said the smiling designer.</p>
        <p>Aleksei Yagudin and other skaters who train in Newington will be participating in Skate America, which will be broadcast on ABC television today at 1 p.m., and Nov. 5 at 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. They will be wearing costumes designed by Ms. Abdulaeva.</p>
