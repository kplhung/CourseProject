      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Joseph Colicchio's novel 'High Gate Health and Beauty,'' is a murder mystery: a strangler kills a dog, and then a man, in a gritty precinct of Jersey City called High Gate, a white working-class neighborhood where ones of race and especially class are firmly enforced. But Joey Scadutto, the novel's 15-year-old hero and a High Gate resident, needs to know much more than the identity of the killer. He's looking to the answer of a question anyone ever born to a dead-end neighborhood asks: how can you leave without losing who you are? The question is familiar to Mr. Colicchio, a Cranford resident who grew up in Jersey City Heights, where views of the New York skyline are equal parts promise and threat. As a professor of English at Hudson County Community College in Jersey City, he now watches many of his students grapple with the same dilemma, balancing community loyalty with future ambition. ''High Gate Health and Beauty'' (Creative Arts) is $14.95 in paperback.</p>
