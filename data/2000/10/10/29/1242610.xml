        <p>The Samsons</p>
        <p>Two Novels in the Rosales Saga:</p>
        <p>''The Pretenders'' and ''Mass.''</p>
        <p>By F. Sionil Jose.</p>
        <p>Modern Library, paper, $14.95.</p>
        <p>This book contains the final two novels in the Filipino writer F. Sionil Jose's five-novel Rosales Saga, and they span three generations in the lives of the Samson family. In the first novel, ''The Pretenders,'' the smart and ambitious Tony Samson escapes his poverty-stricken village, Rosales, and marries the beautiful Carmen Villa, daughter of a rich industrialist, Don Manuel Villa. At the core of Tony's being, however, lies a dark family secret about his father, who was cheated out of his land by an unscrupulous businessman. At Don Manuel's instigation, Tony gives up a promising academic career to enter the Villa family business, the first in a series of compromises that will lead to trouble for all involved. In the second novel, ''Mass,'' we meet Tony's illegitimate son, Pepe, who also rises in society through hard work and intelligence. Like his father, Pepe falls in love with a wealthy Filipino woman, but he avoids his father's mistakes. His is an Oedipal quest, as the truth about his father's identity is long withheld from him. Pepe quickly becomes a student leader and joins a resistance movement dedicated to ousting the Marcos dictatorship. Shunning the corrupt Filipino elite, Pepe lives in a slum and participates in the student uprisings of the 1970's. The author's message is clear: colonialism may have come and gone, but the Filipino people must now bear the burden of fighting their own governing classes. At times the novel reads too much like a Marxist treatise on class exploitation, but over all, this book is a fascinating and worthwhile introduction to a culture and history too often ignored in the West.</p>
