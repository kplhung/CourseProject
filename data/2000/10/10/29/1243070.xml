        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Yankee fans are described as being ''less emotional about the game, less rowdy and more cultured'' (''It's Root, Root, Root, But for Which Team?'' Oct. 19).</p>
        <p>As Red Sox fans who have done hard time in the Fenway Park bleachers during many a Yanks-Red Sox series, we wholeheartedly concur with this description. We're often struck by how gracefully Yankees fans chug their seventh and eighth inning beers, by the nuanced tones of their invective, and by their principled and thoughtful belligerence. With the Yanks in town, the Fenway bleachers truly rival Paris in culture and sophistication.</p>
