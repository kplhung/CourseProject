        <p>For weeks, this village of 3,000 on a verdant mountainside in central Colombia has been gripped by election fever, with candidates scouring for voters and colorful banners hanging across narrow streets. In a scene being repeated across Colombia in preparation for nationwide municipal elections on Sunday, noisy political rallies are staged in the village plaza, topped off with free barbecued beef and weepy vallenato music.</p>
        <p>Behind the festive scenes, Marxist guerrillas in this and hundreds of other communities have spent months quietly manipulating the electoral process, compromising Colombia's fragile democracy and strengthening the position of the country's largest rebel movement.</p>
        <p>Political analysts and groups monitoring the campaigns say the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who have waged a 36-year fight for control of the nation, have made their presence felt in more than half the nation's 1,089 municipalities -- giving tacit approval to candidates, forcing some to withdraw and, in a few cases, assassinating others.</p>
        <p>Paramilitary gunmen have struck back, killing candidates believed to be rebel sympathizers. So far this year, 36 political candidates for mayor, council and other offices have been killed, most by paramilitary gunmen or groups whose identities have not been established, said Maj. Gen. Tobias Duran, director of operations for the National Police. Another 50 were kidnapped. Even the assertion of subtle pressure amounts to a skewing of politics in the guerrillas' favor: by getting candidates to favor paving certain roads, for example, the rebel group can assure easier movement of its arms and supplies in the future. In many cases, candidates are forced to attend well-organized clandestine political gatherings to explain to rebels and local farmers what they would accomplish, if elected.</p>
        <p>''They told me to be at a certain place, at a certain time, and they had me explain my plan for governing,'' explained Luis Eduardo Reyes, 64, one of three candidates for mayor of Quipile, recounting his participation in a meeting with rebels in July. ''It was like a political reunion. You presented your concepts to the farmers, and you talked about your past activities and that was it.''</p>
        <p>In the last national municipal elections in 1997, the guerrilla force, universally known here by its acronym, FARC, vowed to impede elections, forcing hundreds of candidates out and attacking military targets in several communities on Election Day.</p>
        <p>This year, the guerrillas are apparently seeking to make candidates beholden to them, to strengthen their grip on the countryside just as President Andres Pastrana is embarking on a $7.5 billion plan to cut production of coca, the source of much of the guerrillas' funding and power.</p>
        <p>''This is much more subtle because in certain sectors of the state it's seen as positive that the FARC didn't sabotage the elections,'' said Fernando Giraldo, a political scientist at the Javeriana University in Bogota. ''But underneath, while there wasn't sabotage, there was political control over the candidates and over the elections and, in the end, that's the way to have influence over territory.''</p>
        <p>The guerrillas say their political arm, known as the Bolivarian Movement, roots out corrupt politicians and gives the group influence in local decision-making without jeopardizing the lives of guerrillas. In the 1980's, thousands of rebels who laid down their arms to form the Patriotic Union were killed.</p>
        <p>The rebel group's Web site explains that because ''all the governments finished off the opposition with gunfire, with a dirty war, disappearances and terror, the new movement will be structured to work clandestinely.''</p>
        <p>The rebel group thrives in villages where most people have little faith in the central government, places like Quipile, which is more than two hours away from the capital, Bogota, via rutted, unpaved roads. Many villagers suggest that local politicians and the Bogota government have done little for the community. According to that line of thinking, the rebels at least offer oversight over local politicians who never had to worry about keeping their promises.</p>
        <p>''It's good that there's pressure,'' declared Jorge Forero, a middle-aged farmer, as he sipped a beer with three friends in a cantina. ''If there's not, then they make promises, and they don't do anything.''</p>
        <p>The Pastrana administration acknowledges the guerrillas' machinations but says it is evident in only about 6 percent of Colombia's municipalities, or 55 towns. Organizations like the Confederation of Municipalities, which represents mayors, say electoral tampering by the  rebel group and others, including right-wing paramilitaries, has occurred in up to 600 municipalities.</p>
        <p>''It's probable that there has been influence on the part of groups operating on the margins of the law in specific areas,'' said Interior Minister Humberto De la Calle. ''But I'd like to say that 90 percent of Colombians live in areas where the guarantees are absolute and the process will be contemporary and modern.''</p>
        <p>Hermes Villamil, president of the association that represents mayors in the central province of Cundinamarca, said this group of guerrillas ''are more advanced, more prepared, to intervene'' in elections. ''We may have much more interference than in the past,'' said Mr. Villamil, who is mayor of La Mesa, ''but it's harder to notice.''</p>
        <p>Professor Giraldo said he and other experts believe that influence by guerrillas is especially heavy in about 200 municipalities that are strategically situated. In those towns, candidates are expected to push projects the rebel group wants. By gaining influence, political experts say, the group can also strengthen its position in peace talks between rebels and the government.</p>
        <p>''It's not that they're going to come out with the guerrilla flag,'' Mr. Giraldo said of towns under rebel influence, ''but in the process of negotiations, these towns will play a fundamental position in choosing sides. They might lean for the FARC or, at least, stay neutral.''</p>
        <p>In the last few months, Gilberto Toro, director of the Confederation of Municipalities, said he had heard story after story about mayors and other politicians who were approached by rebels. And his organization has tracked a wave of violence, by both rebels and paramilitaries as the two try to gain the upper hand in far-flung municipalities.</p>
        <p>In addition to the killings and kidnappings, the National Registrar of the Civil State, the government agency overseeing the $41 million election, said 24 mayoral candidates and 64 candidates for town councils have withdrawn after meddling by armed groups. And 29 towns have registered only one candidate for mayor, a sign that the tampering has frightened away other candidates.</p>
        <p>In Quipile, 11 candidates are running for municipal council and three for mayor. The guerrillas have attacked the town three times in recent years, destroying the municipal headquarters in their first assault, in 1997. That year, in the guerrilla group's effort to squelch the election, so many candidates dropped out that the election was postponed.</p>
        <p>This year, candidates and residents say, the group's guerrillas have contacted virtually everyone who is running for office. Alberto Cano, a town council hopeful, who  attended a guerrilla meeting, said:. ''We don't see it as a threat. They bring people around, and everyone gets together, but it's nothing bad. You go and explain.''</p>
        <p>But even those who did not feel threatened know there are consequences to talking with guerrillas. That became clear earlier this week when several candidates received a threatening form letter from the paramilitaries, warning them that ''violence can be used in extreme cases'' if they associate with guerrillas.</p>
        <p>''You have the guerrillas on the left, the paramilitaries on the right,'' said Juan Efrain Mendoza, a candidate for town council. ''I have to just stay in the middle. I have to do my job. If I remain impartial, I'll have no problem.''</p>
