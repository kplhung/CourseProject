        <p>In 1626, in a purchase that would become legendary, a Dutch settler named Peter Minuit bought the island of Manhattan from American Indians for $24.</p>
        <p>Now a woman from East Harlem, Marion Bell, is claiming that his name should not adorn a local playground, which is next to P.S. 108, on 108th Street near Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>''There's kind of a shady history that surrounds Mr. Minuit,'' said Ms. Bell, who teaches at a mini-school within P.S. 108 and heads the renaming campaign. ''Peter Minuit was a businessman and an explorer who began the season of exploitation that lasted for centuries.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bell said she became involved in the issue after teaching her students about the famous Dutchman.</p>
        <p>She pointed out that P.S. 108, which was formerly called Peter Minuit School, was renamed last spring to honor Angelo Del Toro, an East Harlem Assemblyman who died in 1995. She also noted that even if the playground's name was changed, Minuit would not go unremembered; a plaza at the ferry terminal at the southern tip of Manhattan already bears his name.</p>
        <p>This month Ms. Bell began circulating a petition asking the community to designate the park for a ''person of good moral character who has committed themselves and contributed honestly to the East Harlem community.'' She has gathered 46 signatures along with recommendations that range from Piri Thomas, a local author whose works include the memoir ''Down These Mean Streets,'' to Pedro Albizu-Campos, a Puerto Rican nationalist.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bell plans to present the petition to the Department of Parks. But Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said the issue would be handled by the City Council.</p>
        <p>''If it's an ideological argument they raise, that Peter Minuit was evil because he bought Manhattan from the Indians, that's part of the delegitimization of American history,'' Mr. Stern said. ''Some people may feel that way, but certainly I don't as Parks Commissioner. We think there's value in remembering the founders of New York City.''</p>
