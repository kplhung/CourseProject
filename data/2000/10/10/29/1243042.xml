        <p>As Dov Scheinerman prepared for the trans-Atlantic journey he began last night, it became clear that he viewed the trip as one of the more mundane excursions of his young life.</p>
        <p>There was packing to do and there were goodbyes to say, but not an iota of anything extraordinary, according to Dov, 16, and his friends Binyamin Tepfer and Sholom Schneider, who also were on a flight that left New York last night.</p>
        <p>Rain shoes, a sweater, socks and other essentials to go in Dov's suitcase lay on the kitchen table as the young men talked Friday at Dov's house in Flatbush, Brooklyn. If unexcited, they did seem resolute about going, and relaxed. But when their plane lands today after the 17-hour flight, they will be in the midst of a situation that is anything but placid.</p>
        <p>They are yeshiva students on their way back to schools in and around Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>And despite the State Department's warning against travel to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza because of the heightened threat of terrorist attacks there, hundreds of students have already gone back. Many more will be leaving today. They say they are on a mission, and go without any fear or a moment's hesitation.</p>
        <p>''It was a given that we'd be returning after the holidays,'' Dov said, having spent Sukkot, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles, at home. He and Mr. Tepfer, 21, and Mr. Schneider, 20, were unalarmed Friday by the recent flurries of violence, including a recent incident involving a Palestinian suicide bomber in Gaza.</p>
        <p>''We checked into the situation and it is not grave danger,'' Mr. Schneider said in smooth monotone, ''especially if we stay in our neighborhoods and learn.''</p>
        <p>To the students and their families, particularly in Orthodox communities, ''sending your child back to Israel is fundamental, it outweighs the potential explosiveness of the situation,'' Rabbi Moshe Scheinerman, Dov's father, explained. ''We're not crazies, but this is supreme. This is our very existence. I would not advise them to go into a war zone. But since the State Department only gave an advisory, we are more concerned about our children's spiritual needs.''</p>
        <p>The new semester for yeshiva students begins today. The last one ended just as violence in the Middle East began to escalate about three weeks ago. That's when tourism began to wane, according to travel agents and a spokeswoman for El Al Israel Airlines.</p>
        <p>But ''through thick and thin, the students go,'' said Judy Tenenbaum, whose Plane Talk travel agency specializes in travel to Israel. ''I had a lot of synagogue groups and Christian groups cancel, but the students, they don't give up.''</p>
        <p>Yeshiva students, who concentrate on Talmudic studies, said they believed the nature of the learning experience would shield them from harm.</p>
        <p>''I believe that in yeshiva learning God will protect me, so there's nothing to worry about,'' said Moshe Friedman, 18, from Borough Park, Brooklyn, who is in his first year at Yeshivas Mir in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Matthew Frogel, 18, added: ''As a Jew, I feel it's important to be there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frogel said he was well aware of the ''story that went around the world'' in early October, when American yeshiva students unintentionally wound up in an Arab neighborhood and were badly beaten by a Palestinian mob.</p>
        <p>''I know that if I stay where I am supposed to be, there's nothing to worry about,'' he said. ''My Torah learning will help protect Israel and that's what God wants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frogel will be studying about an hour west of Jerusalem in Ashdod, where, he said, ''it's really not as horrible as you'd think.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Scheinerman said he had advised many parents in his congregation, Kollel Bnei Yeshivos, in Flatbush, not to let the current state of affairs in the Middle East deter them from sending their children to yeshivas in Israel. Some needed ''direction'' he said.</p>
        <p>None canceled.</p>
        <p>''We feel very strongly that they should be returning to show solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Israel,'' said Rabbi Avi Shafran, spokesman of Agudath Israel of America, an umbrella organization that serves the Orthodox community.</p>
        <p>But still, among parents, ''everybody's talking,'' said Gail Weinreb, a yeshiva parent, ''asking, 'what are you going to do?' Everyone I know is going back, though, and there are a lot of them.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tenenbaum said she arranged travel for about 100 students. Sheryl Stein, spokeswoman for El Al, said that between last Wednesday and today, at least 500 American yeshiva students would be leaving New York City.</p>
        <p>Some parents said they felt reassured because the yeshivas had taken extra measures to keep tabs on the students and update them about dangers. As for Mrs. Weinreb, she's given her son, Meir, 18, specific instructions: what not to do, where not to go. ''I don't have fear,'' she said. ''Neither does he.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinreb affirmed that. ''My mind is on my schoolwork,'' he said.</p>
