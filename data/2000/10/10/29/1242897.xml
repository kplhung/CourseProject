        <p>Graves dating as far back as the 1600's long lay undisturbed behind the landmarked Flushing Quaker Meeting House at 137-16 Northern Boulevard. Until three weeks ago, that is, when one tombstone was stolen.</p>
        <p>Compounding the problem is that no one could say whose tombstone it was, or even what it looked like.</p>
        <p>''It's a shame all around,'' said Joan Kindler, the clerk of the meeting house, shortly after the theft was discovered by the caretaker. ''I can't find any records. I don't know whether it's 19th or 18th century.''</p>
        <p>The thief or thieves are believed to have struck sometime around Columbus Day weekend.</p>
        <p>Identifying Quaker tombstones by sight alone is difficult because, like Quaker craftsmanship in general, they are designed to be simple and modest. Before the 1700's, the congregation didn't believe in having  any tombstones at all. The ones that remain at the meeting house site, from the 18th and 19th centuries, are basically nubs of white stone, mostly marble, that barely peek out of the ground.</p>
        <p>In the late 1800's, city regulations forbade burials within local churchyards. No one knows how many Quakers are buried on the meeting house property, which amounts to about an acre of land.</p>
        <p>Without any firm description of what the stolen object looked like, police from the 109th Precinct were having trouble opening an investigation.</p>
        <p>But on Monday, in the archives of the Queens Historical Society, Jim Driscoll, the research director, found an old map of the cemetery. He said that it would take some research but that there was a good chance that the missing tombstone could at least be  linked with a name.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kindler said, ''It would be good to at least know for the meeting's records who it was, but I don't think we're going to get it back.'' She added sadly, ''We just took our quiet, peaceful cemetery for granted.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kindler said that because of the theft, members were going to videotape the graveyard and the meeting house, which was built in 1694.</p>
        <p>Cemetery vandalism is not a new problem for historians, Mr. Driscoll added. ''We'll just try to record what's left,'' he said.</p>
