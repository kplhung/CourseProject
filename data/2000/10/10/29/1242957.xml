        <p>Time-starved workers complain that voting on Election Day is much easier said than done.</p>
        <p>For them, a trip to the polls means squeezing in yet another errand before work, taking an extended lunch hour or sneaking out early.</p>
        <p>It may not have to be that stressful.</p>
        <p>According to Firstdoor.com of Kennesaw, Ga., a human resources consulting firm, 31 states have voter-leave laws that require that workers be off for at least two to three hours while the polls are open. New York has a voter-leave law, while Connecticut and New Jersey do not.</p>
        <p>Kimberlee S. Ullner, Firstdoor's director of human resources and of legal compliance, said many workers were unaware of such laws.</p>
        <p>Although voter-leave laws vary by state, she said, there are similarities. Twenty-four states require employers to pay for the time that employees need to vote; 17 require employees to request time off in advance. Some have both requirements.</p>
        <p>For employers, she said, noncompliance can result in fines -- $25 in Arkansas and up to $20,000 in Arizona. In 12 other states, employers can receive jail sentences of 30 days to a year. The laws ''are aimed at encouraging employers to be good corporate citizens and for employers to vote,'' she said.</p>
