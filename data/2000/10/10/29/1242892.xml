        <p>AMONG friends, Teddy Walkowicz is known for his long bachelorhood, which seemed as hard to break as a secret code; his imitation of Jack Nicholson; his heartfelt thank-you notes on beautiful stationery; his aversion to barber shops (he cuts his own hair); his beautiful clothes; his bizarre clothes; and his graciousness.</p>
        <p>''He's a very traditional New Yorker,'' said Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure magazine and a friend. ''He went to Buckley, he went to Hotchkiss. He plays a great game of golf. You'd think you'd have this guy pegged as someone stodgy, but he's not in any way. He's very unpredictable.'' She added: ''I can give you a list of 20 people who have had crushes on the guy. He's the perfect combination everybody wants: someone with a free spirit but also someone who can hold down a job.''</p>

        <p>AMONG friends, Teddy Walkowicz is known for his long bachelorhood, which seemed as hard to break as a secret code; his imitation of Jack Nicholson; his heartfelt thank-you notes on beautiful stationery; his aversion to barber shops (he cuts his own hair); his beautiful clothes; his bizarre clothes; and his graciousness.</p>
        <p>''He's a very traditional New Yorker,'' said Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure magazine and a friend. ''He went to Buckley, he went to Hotchkiss. He plays a great game of golf. You'd think you'd have this guy pegged as someone stodgy, but he's not in any way. He's very unpredictable.'' She added: ''I can give you a list of 20 people who have had crushes on the guy. He's the perfect combination everybody wants: someone with a free spirit but also someone who can hold down a job.''</p>
        <p>At the end of 1998, Mr. Walkowicz, a managing director for convertible securities at Credit Suisse First Boston in Manhattan, met Jane Cullen, a Wilhelmina model, on a blind date that took place on the most humiliating night possible for a blind date: New Year's Eve. Their mutual friends, Leelee Brown and Pat Isom, arranged for them to accompany each other to a black-tie dinner-dance at the Maidstone Club in East Hampton, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cullen, who also works as a physician's assistant for several Manhattan plastic surgeons, has blond, flawless looks that make one expect aloofness and 24-hour sunglasses. But she is in fact so warm and unpretentious that in a recent conversation she excitedly recounted things like the first time she ate fresh tuna rather than canned. Ms. Cullen, who was married briefly before, grew up in Douglaston, Queens, and can name every starting player for both the Mets and the Yankees. Ms. Isom said: ''She's just as comfortable with someone who works in a gas station as she is with someone who's the C.E.O. of a major company. She's been around both kinds of people, and she charms everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walkowicz, who dreaded spending New Year's with a stranger -- even a model -- called it ''a mercy mission'' and dressed accordingly. Ms. Brown recalled: ''He showed up with a goatee, a dinner jacket on the top half and beige corduroys on the bottom, with sneakers. It was horrifying.''</p>
        <p>To both Mr. Walkowicz's and Ms. Cullen's surprise, it was a wonderful evening. ''We sat together at dinner and talked about Pop-Tarts -- we both love Pop-Tarts -- and music, theater, golf,'' Ms. Cullen said. ''We were the last people to leave the room. Someone finally tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Jane, it's time.' ''</p>
        <p>After that night, he shaved and began courting her like a gentleman. ''First, he called Jane several times and made a date,'' Ms. Isom said. ''Then he didn't call again for three days. Then he called and asked her out for a date 10 days from then. It was so proper it drove you crazy.''</p>
        <p>By last December, he had fallen so in love he began letting Ms. Cullen borrow his clothes. ''She wasn't allowed to wear some of my favorite T-shirts for a while,'' he said. ''But right before Christmas, I let her wear my favorite one.''</p>
        <p>On Oct. 21, they were married in a family-only ceremony in Christ Church United Methodist on Park Avenue, with a reception afterward for 210 guests at the Boathouse in Central Park. The bride wore a tiara, a white mink stole and a slinky, strappy dress. She looked like Grace Kelly getting out of a convertible sports car in ''To Catch a Thief.''</p>
        <p>When asked about marriage, the bridegroom quoted Jack Nicholson. ''In 'As Good as It Gets,' he said to Helen Hunt, 'You make me want to be a better man,' '' recalled the bridegroom. ''There's truth in that. Jane's virtue is a great inspiration to me. In New York, people backstab, claw, crush, push aside others to get to a position of power. That's just not part of Jane's personality. There's no cattiness to her. She's incredibly patient and so unbelievably good-natured and upbeat. Jane is a genuine throwback to a more idyllic period.''</p>
