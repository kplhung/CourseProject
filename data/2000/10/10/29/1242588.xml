        <p>THE NIGHT LISTENER</p>
        <p>By Armistead Maupin.</p>
        <p>342 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>HarperCollins Publishers. $26.</p>
        <p>ARMISTEAD MAUPIN'S first novel in eight years tells the story of 54-year-old Gabriel Noone, a writer and host of the vastly popular radio show, ''Noone at Night.'' Noone has a fabulous house in San Francisco and millions of devoted listeners, but all his success hardly matters. When the story opens, he has just been left by his longtime partner, Jess Carmody, who has survived AIDS and is now looking for something new in life, preferably in leather.</p>
        <p>One day, shortly after Jess leaves, Gabriel receives the galleys of a book by Peter Lomax, a 13-year-old boy who has written a memoir about the physical and sexual abuse he endured at the hands of his parents. No ordinary kid, Pete is one of Gabriel's most avid fans. He's also dying of AIDS.</p>
        <p>''It's not an easy thing to trim Pete's story to its barest bones,'' Gabriel explains, ''to trot out the horror for your examination, minus Pete's wisdom and courage and disarming humor. But that's what I have to do if you're to understand how fiercely those galleys consumed me, and why I slept so uneasily that night, and why, above all, I went straight to the phone the following morning.''</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the novel is the telephone relationship that develops between Gabriel and Pete after Gabriel agrees to blurb Pete's book. They develop a habit of talking in the middle of the night -- about paternal love, illness, desertion, trust. Pete lives in Wisconsin with feisty Donna, his adoptive mother (Pete's biological parents were imprisoned for selling Pete to pedophiles), has a voice like Bart Simpson and talks like Bart would if he weren't subjected to the censors of network television.</p>
        <p>Maupin is best known for his pop juggernaut, ''Tales of the City,'' the groundbreaking serial, first published in the mid-1970's in The San Francisco Chronicle, that begat the series of best-selling novels, six in all, that begat the television series watched round the world. Today those books, which depicted the lives of sunny California eccentrics who lived at the mythic 28 Barbary Lane in the time before Reagan and AIDS, seem almost quaint, their experiences cute antics in a land before time.</p>
        <p>Despite Maupin's trademark coziness and devotion to the sentimental, ''The Night Listener'' is a novel for an edgier era. Its narrator is no longer young and is wistful for a more rollicking time. Maupin also explores some interesting aspects of the post-drug-cocktail life, when gay men who expected to die suddenly find themselves surviving -- and experience not a midlife crisis but a new life crisis.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it's his former partner who first suggests to Gabriel that perhaps the long-suffering Pete and his valiant adoptive mom are too good to be true. First Jess wonders if Pete isn't elaborating on his suffering -- it's so extravagant -- then he intimates that there might not be any Pete at all.</p>
        <p>''Pete and Donna have the same voice,'' says Jess, after having spoken to both of them for about 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I know,'' Gabriel replies. ''It's that flat Midwestern thing. Not very pretty.''</p>
        <p>''No. I mean it's the same person.''</p>
        <p>The story takes a surprising and sophisticated turn at this point, proving Maupin to be cagier than the first third of the book suggests. (Jess also says about Pete, ''What's not to like? He's Tiny Tim.'') Pete fills a crater-sized hole in Gabriel's heart, and the scene where they become informally father and son is touching. But aside from Pete's heartbreaking story, and all Gabriel's carrying on about how perceptive and empathetic he is, the child doesn't seem remarkable. He swears cutely and can wield a lot of therapy lingo (''You have a right to your feelings''), but it's clear that what's so special is Gabriel's need of him. Pete might indeed be someone's invention.</p>
        <p>Who knew one of the sweetest writers in America, known for his gentle comedies of manners, could also spin a solid page turner? After Gabriel's love for ''the offspring of my heart'' is sullied by misgivings, the book opens out into a mystery studded with elegant twists and turns. In the end, the reader is captivated and won't be able to get on with things until ''The Night Listener'' is wolfed down whole, like a midnight snack eaten standing up at the kitchen sink.</p>
        <p>Karen Karbo's most recent novel is ''Motherhood Made a Man Out of Me.''</p>
