        <p>Even before there was a Declaration of Independence, there was the United States Army Corps of Engineers -- though that was not what it was called. It had no name.</p>
        <p>The cCorps' first project came in 1775 -- only days after the first shots were fired in the Revolutionary War -- when the commanders and revolutionaries in Boston asked engineers to build fortifications around Bunker Hill in preparation for a presumed British assault.</p>
        <p>By 1802, an official Corps of Engineers was in place at West Point -- with its commanding view of the Hudson River -- and the classes it held there were actually the beginnings of the United States Military Academy. The academy remained under the supervision of the corps until 1866.</p>
        <p>Today, the corps -- of which about 98 percent of its employees are civilians -- builds structures like recreation halls, barracks and hospitals for the military, as a kind of general contractor for all military real estate construction. In addition, it has been authorized by Congress to be the nation's handyman of sorts, handling governmental odd jobs.</p>
        <p>For instance, it is one of the main agencies, along with the Environmental Protection Agency, that does environmental cleanup, from minor hazardous waste to abandoned brownfields or underutilized industrial or commercial sites that may have environmental problems. In recent years, the Corps of Engineers has done a great deal of work at military bases that have been closed down, particularly where there had been atomic weapons.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Corps of Engineers has oversight for coastal and waterway construction and preservation, under which the current New Jersey beach replenishment plan falls.</p>
        <p>The corps also has an umbrella of other functions, including research in the nation's frigid regions and what it calls ice management; determining logistics for warfare; managing the military's ship building contracts; and generating power during national emergencies or disasters.</p>
        <p>The corps is split up into eight geographical divisions and 41 districts. New Jersey is in the North Atlantic Division, divided between the Philadelphia and New York districts. Some of the corps' projects in the state besides the beach replenishment are the renovation of buildings at McGuire Air Force Base, dredging of the Intercoastal Waterway channel, seeking a better flood control plan for the Passaic River, helping clean up a former uranium oxide production plant near Carney's Point and building a horseshoe crab nesting environment along the Delaware Bay near Villas.</p>
