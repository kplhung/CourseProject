        <p>BLAME the twins. Or give them credit.</p>
        <p>For 15 years, Debbie Ardino was employed by Con Ed, as an executive secretary to two vice presidents among other positions.</p>
        <p>''It was a wonderful company to work for,'' she said. ''I thought I would be at Con Ed forever.''</p>
        <p>But after the birth of twin sons, Mathew and Robert, she began interviewing nannies and didn't like what she saw. ''It really scared me,'' she said. ''Some of these people were far too strict. I started to think I'll stay home and start a business. I won't be leaving my children alone with someone.''</p>
        <p>Eleven years later, Mrs. Ardino has a new identity: the Phantom Typist. She runs a thriving word processing business from her home in White Plains, with 15 to 20 regular clients who turn to her for transcription, typing, word processing and administrative back-up.</p>
        <p>The name ''Phantom Typist'' came from Georgene Mongarella, now a successful  Westchester interior designer who had worked with Mrs. Ardino at Con Ed while doing design work part-time on the side. ''I supported her when she left,'' Ms. Ardino said. ''It gave me the courage to do it because she was nervous about leaving.''</p>
        <p>When she made the leap, Mrs. Ardino recalled, ''I didn't even own a computer.''</p>
        <p>Both women immediately joined the Westchester Association of Women Business Owners, a 24-year-old organization devoted to helping women find mentors, peers and clients. With 200 or so members, the group meets once a month for networking and a dinner with a speaker, says its president, Linda Karesh, who runs two companies of her own.</p>
        <p>Last month Ann Tucker, owner of A. M. Tucker and Company , an event-planning concern in Rye, won the group's Lillian Vernon award, an annual honor given to the association member who is deemed most successful in business while giving back to the community. The group charges $95 year for membership, offers a quarterly newsletter and has a Web site, www.wawbo.com.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ardino, a lively friendly brunette who runs three to four miles every morning before starting her workday, had never before worked for herself, and had never worked from home. But setting up her own business seemed the right choice: she could control her space and time, keep a close eye on her two boys and use the talents she had developed at Con Ed. She estimates her start-up costs at $3,000 for a computer, letterhead and business cards. Beyond a listing in the Yellow Pages, she has never  advertised.</p>
        <p>She started with a simple notice on a bulletin board at a local copy shop advertising her skills. Within the first week, Mrs. Ardino got a call from Jonathan Liebowitz, a White Plains arbitrator and mediator who had seen her notice. He is still a regular client. ''We're neighbors, practically,'' said Mr. Liebowitz who often drops off materials at Mrs. Ardino's home. ''Debbie's very good at everything, and very accommodating.''</p>
        <p>Today, earning more than $50,000 a year, she said she cannot imagine being on someone else's payroll. ''I would hate to work for anyone else,'' she said. ''I love the flexibility.''</p>
        <p>To figure out how much to charge in the beginning, she called at least six other local secretarial services before deciding to ask $10 an hour. Today she earns $30 an hour. There is no shortage of work, she said. ''People are working leaner and meaner,'' she said. ''There are a lot of conferences to cover. I do a lot of legal work. There is one attorney I work for almost every day.'' A few loyal clients who have since moved to Florida or California still choose her services.</p>
        <p>Running her own business has taught Mrs. Ardino a few things along the way, like the need, occasionally, to stop working for  an overly difficult or unpleasant client.</p>
        <p>Quality control is essential, she learned. Once a mailing of 1,000 envelopes was printed on the wrong paper and addresses started rubbing off. She salvaged the job, although it took ''hours and hours.'' Another time her computer suddenly died. ''That's what a MasterCard is for,'' she said calmly. ''Sure, your blood pressure might go up for a few hours, but that's part of the business.'' (She now has three computers, just in case.)</p>
        <p>Essential to her success, she said, is sticking to a routine. Her workday starts around 9:30 or 10 a.m. and usually ends at 4 p.m.  when her sons get home from school. She doesn't ''do'' lunch, saying, ''It breaks up the day.''</p>
        <p>She will occasionally take a five-minute break to put in a load of laundry or a bit of housework, but stresses ''you have to be very structured, very regimented to work at home.''</p>
        <p>Most important, she said, is a sense of humor. ''That's No. 1, people skills,'' she said. ''You can't be deadpan or have no personality.''</p>
        <p>Through the women's business group, and on her own, Mrs. Ardino tries to encourage other women to work for themselves. ''I've helped a lot of people start their own business,'' she said. ''I'll stay on the phone for a half-hour giving someone advice. There's enough work out there for everyone.''</p>
        <p>Business Women By the Numbers</p>
        <p>The Web site for the Westchester Association of Women Business Owners offers these facts about association members:</p>
        <p>More than 40 percent of those surveyed reported gross revenues of $200,000 or more.</p>
        <p>Thirty-seven percent of members have owned their business for 10 years or more.</p>
        <p>Membership is split 50/50 between those who work from home and those who work from an office.</p>
        <p>Sixty percent of members are between 40 and 60 years old.</p>
        <p>Sixty-three percent are married.</p>
        <p>Thirty percent have web sites.</p>
        <p>Sixty percent have two or fewer employees; 7 percent had 50 or more.</p>
