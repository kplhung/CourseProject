        <p>or Sexual License?</p>
        <p>The American Revolt</p>
        <p>Against Victorianism.</p>
        <p>By Kevin White.</p>

        <p>''Americans today may look back with nostalgia at the Victorians, for their system managed to create a healthy balance between sexual repression and sexual liberation,'' Kevin White writes in ''Sexual Liberation or Sexual License?'' White, a tutorial fellow at the University of Sussex in England, draws on an impressive assortment of writings, movies, advertisements, legal cases, intellectual movements and economic trends to track American attitudes toward sex since 1830. He argues that Victorianism -- with its emphasis on the sanctity of marriage and privacy in intimate matters -- is the sexual standard from which American society has been declining since before World War I. Contradictions abound: of the 1950's, White says, ''Everybody got married,'' and he claims that American families of that era were happy; at the same time, he offers midcentury phenomena like Playboy, the Beats and Elvis Presley as evidence that morality was crumbling and that Americans were dissatisfied with their personal lives. At the end of the book, he deplores the Internet for making it ''impossible to escape the discussion of intimate acts, even in one's living room.'' It is hard to see how this represents a moral deterioration from Victorian times, when, as White maintains, frank conversation and physical passion were encouraged in the private sphere.</p>
