        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Not mentioned in '' 'Rosie the Riveter' Honored in California Memorial'' (news article, Oct. 22), your nostalgic article about World War II, was the role played by San Francisco's young men about to enter the military.</p>
        <p>We were all able-bodied, the labor shortage was unbelievable, and the shipyards were anxious to hire any of us, even for a few months. The short-lived camaraderie among us was wonderful. Many of us had short deferments until we could finish the current school terms. We preferred the swing shifts or graveyard shifts so we could attend daytime classes. When our shifts were over, we would adjourn to an all-night diner, talk about the war and then head off to the late-night movies.</p>
        <p>It was the best of times and the worst of times.</p>
