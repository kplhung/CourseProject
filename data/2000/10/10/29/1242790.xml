        <p>WITH the exception of Richard A. McGinn, who was ousted last week as chairman and chief executive of Lucent Technologies, perhaps no one was more distressed by that corporate upheaval than Henry B. Schacht. Mr. Schacht, 66, who was Lucent's chief executive for two years after the company was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1996, was called back to replace Mr. McGinn, his protege, whom he had helped groom for the job.</p>
        <p>''This is not what I had in mind,'' Mr. Schacht said in an interview. ''Just a year ago this company was in top form.''</p>
        <p>After leaving Lucent, Mr. Schacht joined Warburg Pincus, an investment firm, as a senior adviser and recently was appointed chairman of Avaya Inc., which makes office communications equipment. (Before joining Lucent the first time, Mr. Schacht ran the Cummins Engine Company of Columbus, Ind., and has been called the ''king of the Rust Belt.'')</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Schacht and after his departure, Lucent exceeded profit forecasts for 15 consecutive quarters -- a string that ended this year. It became apparent, however, that under Mr. McGinn, Lucent was losing business to rivals like Nortel Networks, which produces fiber optic technology that is favored by many customers building communications networks.</p>
        <p>As Lucent's shares tumbled, losing more than 70 percent of their value from a high of $78.92 late last year, Mr. McGinn was out and Mr. Schacht was back in.</p>
        <p>Although Lucent is expected to look for a new chief executive during the next few months, Mr. Schacht is busy putting the company back on track. Last week, after speaking with all of the company's large clients, he put filling the ''robust demand'' for fiber optic products at the top of his list of priorities.</p>
        <p>After a quick analysis of the company's  problems, Mr. Schacht also said that Lucent could not meet Mr. McGinn's optimistic growth projections.</p>
        <p>''We'll be judged on our performance of meeting our clients' needs and not much more,'' he said. ''We know that it is with actions, and not words, how we're going to solve our problems.''</p>
