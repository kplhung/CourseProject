        <p>The emotional funerals of four Palestinians who were shot dead on Friday proved the flashpoint for renewed clashes today between Palestinians and Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza, leaving at least 29 Palestinians injured in Gaza, including a 14-year-old boy who was in critical condition after being shot in the head.</p>
        <p>A battle near Gaza's main checkpoint with Israel began after the funeral of Jaber al-Mishal, whose body, draped in a Palestinian flag, was carried by a throng of mourners, some of them shooting bursts of automatic-rifle fire in the air.</p>
        <p>There was a funeral in Ramallah, too, with mourners chanting, ''Al Aksa will only be freed by the blood of martyrs,'' in reference to the Jerusalem mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, which has become the symbol of the month-long unrest here.</p>
        <p>The site is also holy to Jews, who know the place where the mosque is located as Temple Mount, and it was a visit there by the Israeli right-wing leader, Ariel Sharon, that touched off the current violence.</p>
        <p>Two Palestinians wounded in earlier battles were reported today to have died, raising the toll in the unrest to at least 137, all but 8 of them Arabs. A teenager evacuated with a group of wounded to a hospital in Saudi Arabia, 16-year-old Muhammad Mahfouz, died of a bullet wound in his head, the Saudi daily Al Riyadh reported. Hospital officials in Gaza said a Palestinian journalist wounded by Israeli rocket fire in Bethlehem nine days ago had died in a hospital in Jordan.</p>
        <p>In Gilo, a vast white-stone Jewish settlement on a hilltop on the southern edge of Jerusalem that was built after the 1967 war, residents gathered, some with binoculars, to stare and point at the neighboring Arab village of Beit Jala.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials say that there were bursts of gunfire again last night from Beit Jala toward Gilo, and that the army responded with fire from tanks and rockets from helicopter gunships. Army tanks were parked around Gilo, a comforting presence for the residents, the guns on their turrets pointed toward Beit Jala across a deep stony valley.</p>
        <p>But in Beit Jala, a prosperous place of well-kept stone houses where Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholics and Muslims mingle, neighbors solemnly filed into into Yacoub Quiassa's fine three-story home, packed with furniture and Orthodox religious icons, to survey the damage.</p>
        <p>Two rockets fired from helicopters hit the house a little after 11 o'clock Friday night, along with long bursts of .50-caliber machine-gun fire. One rocket hit squarely on the dividing wall between the bathroom and kitchen, destroying both rooms and leaving the refrigerator, with a Madonna and Child poster taped to its door, pitched on its side across the floor. All three stories were damaged, including the children's upstairs bedrooms.</p>
        <p>''There were 25 people here, including 15 children,'' Mr. Quiassa said. ''When we heard the helicopter, we ran out with all the family and took shelter in the school.''</p>
        <p>The fragments of the rockets, some with identifying markings, were piled on display on the kitchen table, covered with gray dust from the pulverized concrete, near a chipped plate showing St. George slaying the dragon.</p>
        <p>''This is a present from Mr. Clinton for our children,'' Mr. Quiassa said bitterly, picking up a large piece of the rocket's tail. ''There was no firing from here. I do not allow it.''</p>
        <p>A Muslim sheik, the judge of a local Islamic court, dressed in a suit and tie topped with a maroon fez wrapped in white cloth signifying his religious profession, pushed through the crowd, embraced Mr. Quiassa and immediately began a lengthy and elaborate speech in Arabic about Palestinian unity.</p>
        <p>''An awful, horrendous and cruel attack on a civilian home,'' he said. ''This shows we have to continue resistance. We must eliminate and destroy the occupation.''</p>
        <p>A little way down the road, Emad al-Tareh surveyed three big holes that tank and rocket fire had punched into the huge house his uncle and other relatives have been building as a gathering place for their extended family. Like their neighbor, Mr. Quiassa, the relatives have been working abroad to accumulate money to return home and build this house.</p>
        <p>''It was their dream,'' he said. ''All of the family could gather and visit here.''</p>
        <p>''I live next door so I am sure there was no shooting from here,'' he said. ''Maybe from the gardens below. When we are shooting to Gilo, maybe it's not nice, it's a danger for the neighbors. But it's for our rights. I am a peaceful man, but I can't really object to what they are doing.''</p>
