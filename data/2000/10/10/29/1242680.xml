        <p>A WELL-KNOWN piece of public art in Hamden faces an uncertain future.</p>
        <p>Like the Velveteen Rabbit, the cars in the Ghost Parking Lot exhibit at the Hamden Plaza have been well loved. But unlike that beloved bunny, as they've aged they have become jagged, decrepit and downright dangerous.</p>
        <p>Just about everyone in town -- and beyond -- who's weighed in on the subject would like to see the artwork restored. But is it salvageable? Since the piece was installed in 1978 by the sculptor and architect James Wines, it has earned a reputation as one of the first, and best, site-specific pieces of public art -- art that derives its meaning from its location. The original work contained 20 junked cars that were stripped of their interiors, sandblasted to remove exterior paint, filled with concrete to various depths, from full exposure of the body to complete burial, and then covered with a thin layer of asphalt so that the sculpture blended in with its surroundings -- the shopping plaza parking lot. The vehicles include sedans, station wagons, convertibles and sports cars (but no S.U.V.'s).</p>
        <p>This piece and many other works of art were purchased and installed in the plaza by David Bermant, the former owner of the shopping center, who died in January. The David W. Bermant Art Foundation was created in his memory, and it is that foundation that may yet save the sculpture.</p>
        <p>The plaza, which opened in the 1950's, was dying by the mid-1970's, according to a 1989 local newspaper article quoting Mr. Bermant. He said he was losing tenants and decided to do something different by installing pieces of art throughout the plaza. The Ghost Parking Lot was the first one, and within a month he said business at some stores increased by up to 40 percent.</p>
        <p>But time and human traffic have not been kind to the sculpture.</p>
        <p>''There's been a lot of climbing and jumping on it, but it should be used; we don't want to discourage that,'' Mr. Wines said of his work. He is the founder and president of a design firm in New York City called SITE, and head of the architecture department at Pennsylvania State University. He is the winner of 25 major art and design awards and this year published a book on architecture and ecology.</p>
        <p>His sculpture has been even more used in recent years by bicyclists and skateboarders who launch themselves off the cars onto the shopping center parking lot. Michael Flight, president of the realty company that manages the shopping center, said they have tried to keep the children from playing on the sculpture to no avail.</p>
        <p>Six of the 20 cars were placed on one side of an entrance to the plaza, 14 on the other. Three of the group of six were removed last year to widen the entrance. The three that were adjacent were removed a few months ago to provide more parking and to lessen the liability risk, according to Mr. Flight.</p>
        <p>Despite the decay of the sculpture, community ties to it remain strong for some.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of sentimental interest in this thing,'' Mr. Wines said. All the cars were donated, and they all had their stories.</p>
        <p>For example, a woman whose son died gave his Karmann Ghia to the project, with artifacts from his life inside it.</p>
        <p>''It was built as a work of art you could not possibly put in a museum,'' Mr. Wines said. ''Its vitality comes from being in a parking lot. We were interested in being in a situation where the people are. Art for everyone is very democratic.''</p>
        <p>The first person to sound the alarm that the entire sculpture was in danger was Joy Wulke, a local sculptor who has a piece of her own on display at the shopping center. She had heard from the Bermant family that the partnership that now owns the plaza was considering demolishing it. She contacted Mimsie Coleman, coordinator of the Hamden Arts Commission, who organized the rescue effort.</p>
        <p>''I just had a feeling that this was an important piece of public art,'' Ms. Coleman said. She began researching it, and that's when she learned that Ghost Parking Lot had made its way into art books and art school curricula around the world.</p>
        <p>But it's also very much a local Hamden treasure. ''There was major community involvement'' at the time the piece was installed, Ms. Coleman said. ''There are a lot of locals who feel it's part of their history; they grew up with it, even if they don't know its history in the art world.''</p>
        <p>Kathy Lucoff, a curator of public art exhibitions in California, called Ms. Coleman from Los Angeles when she heard rumors of demolition.</p>
        <p>''I feel it's one of the best examples of public art in America,'' Ms. Lucoff said, and she wrote a letter of support to bolster Ms. Coleman's efforts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flight said his company had made repairs three times in the past five years, but one would never know it from its present condition: the asphalt has worn away in many places, exposing rusted car bodies and the cement that was poured to fill them. Weeds have pushed through cracks in the cement. Mr. Flight said he hopes that a complete restoration can be done, because he believes the sculpture attracts customers to the plaza. Asked his interpretation, he offered, ''People had such a good time shopping that their cars were paved over because they stayed so long.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wines said he hasn't seen his project for years, and he is planning a trip to Hamden to investigate the damage. ''I think I'd be the one to decide if it's repairable. If it's unsalvageable, I would say so.''</p>
        <p>The plan, Ms. Coleman said, is for the Bermant Art Foundation to set up a nonprofit corporation through Ms. Wulke's arts organization, Projects for a New Millennium. The foundation would make an annual grant to maintain the sculpture. As for funds to restore it, David Bermant's son Andrew, a spokesman for the foundation, said: ''I would need to know what the restoration costs are. We have limited resources. We can't write a blank check.''</p>
        <p>He said if the cost is in the six figures, the foundation could probably pay for some temporary work until it raised enough money to do the job right.</p>
        <p>''If it can't be properly repaired, it probably should be removed,'' Mr. Bermant added, although he would hate to see that happen. He didn't know what his father's interpretation of the sculpture was, but he did know his dad's philosophy of public art: ''He took concepts and materials about today's lifestyle and punched people between the eyes and made them experience life from the artist's viewpoint. That gave him a thrill.''</p>
