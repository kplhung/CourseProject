        <p>No one ever before succeeded to the deanship of Cooper Union's architecture school, because John Hejduk was the first and -- for 25 years -- the only dean.</p>
        <p>Now, Ysrael A. Seinuk, an engineer and a professor at Cooper Union, has been named acting dean of the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture while a search is conducted for a permanent successor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hejduk, a celebrated figure in American design, was the director of Cooper Union's architecture department. When it became a full-fledged school in 1975, he became dean, which he remained until his retirement last June, a month before he died.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seinuk, who came to New York in 1960 from Havana, is president and chief executive of the Cantor Seinuk Group, where he will remain while serving as acting dean. New Yorkers may not know the firm but they certainly know its engineering work: Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, Trump World Tower near the United Nations, the Trump Organization's Riverside South project on the Hudson River, the Conde Nast Building in Times Square and the Bear Stearns headquarters on Madison Avenue, at 46th Street.</p>
        <p>''I've been at Cooper Union for 31 years and I was always very close to John Hejduk,'' Mr. Seinuk said, ''so the process is not something that's new to me.'' But, he allowed, ''I'm stepping into very large shoes.''</p>
