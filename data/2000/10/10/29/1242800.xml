        <p>In the window of El Jardin Restaurante on Main Avenue, where the awning advertises Comida Tipica Mexicana, or authentic Mexican food, a poster for a Passaic County freeholder candidate includes a message that Spanish-speaking voters understand all too well:</p>
        <p>''!El momento ha llegado! Elejamos a uno de los nuestros.'' ''The moment has arrived! Let's elect one of our own.''</p>
        <p>''The moment,'' of course, refers to next Tuesday's election; and ''one of our own'' is equally obvious. Despite the fact that 29 percent, or about 140,000 of Passaic County's 485,064 resident are Hispanic, none of the seven Passaic County freeholders are. And in this city, where two-thirds of its residents either come from or have parents who come from places where Spanish is the primary language, only two in seven city council members are Hispanic.</p>
        <p>The United States Department of Justice agrees with the poster's sentiments, and has taken the position that many Hispanics in Passaic County have not even had an adequate opportunity to vote.</p>
        <p>Last month, in what amounted to a federal takeover of the county Board of Elections after the filing of a civil rights suit filed by the Justice Department in 1998, a former federal prosecutor was appointed to act as a county election monitor.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as far as a Justice Department spokeswoman, Kara Peterson, knows, the monitor, Walter F. Timpone -- who has the power to hire and fire election workers and distribute election material -- is the only federal election monitor in place in the country this election season.</p>
        <p>The department filed the suit after an investigation into complaints were lodged by Hispanic residents here, who claimed that they were discouraged from voting in  Passaic, Paterson, Clifton, Haledon and Prospect Park because of the lack of bilingual poll workers and voting materials and intimidation from poll workers and off-duty officers from the Passaic County Sheriff's Department.</p>
        <p>''Basically, one of our major concerns has been the lack of participation of Latinos in the electoral process, and the lack of representation of candidates for office in the county that would seem to be a reflection of the population,'' said Daniel Jara, president of the state Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and Paterson native, who founded the organization in 1989 before moving it to Jersey City three years ago. ''It has a big impact because the county awards millions of dollars in contracts, and we don't have someone who will open the door for us. And this goes far beyond Passaic County.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jara said 65 percent of the businesses in Paterson and Passaic, the county's commercial centers, were owned by Latinos. ''We are paying the taxes, but we are not being part of the process and part of the opportunities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Timpone, a registered Democrat who is a former assistant United States attorney for New Jersey, was appointed after municipal elections in May and the county primary the following month in which federal election observers reported that the county had not complied with a consent order it signed in June 1999.</p>
        <p>He said the complaints cited a pattern of abuses by off-duty sheriff's officers either working at the polls or serving as election challengers for the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>William Curry, who is chairman of the Passaic County Democratic Committee and is one of two Democrats on the four-member Board of Elections, said the abuses have been orchestrated by Edwin Englehardt, the longtime Republican sherrif.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curry charged that because the county's Hispanics had tended to vote Democratic, it was in the sheriff's interest to suppress the vote. ''These kinds of abuses have been going on for years,'' he said said. Sheriff Englehardt failed to respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>
        <p>One step Mr. Timpone took almost immediately was to ban law-enforcement officers from working at the polls, a job that pays $100.</p>
        <p>But other county Republicans have defended the sheriff, who at a 1988 rally for Vice President George Bush referred to the American Civil Liberties Union as ''that great organization that's against everything that is right with America.''</p>
        <p>Freeholder Walter W. Porter Jr., one of three Republicans on the seven-member board, said the sheriff was popular among all groups in the county and had appointed more minorities, including and blacks and Hispanics, than any other county department head.</p>
        <p>''I know Englehardt well enough to know he would not tolerate any hanky-panky,'' Mr. Porter said. ''He doesn't need to win an election by intimidating people.''</p>
        <p>Miguel de la Carerra, one of two Republicans currently running for freeholder, said, ''I haven't heard of any intimidation out of the Sheriff's office.''</p>
        <p>In a gesture that Mr. Timpone called encouraging, the freeholders unanimously approved a resolution in support of the ban on law-enforcement officers working the polls. The resolution states that the ban is intended to avoid ''the appearance of a conflict of interest,'' not an actual conflict, and nowhere does it suggest that voters have ever been intimidated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Porter, who has been a freeholder since 1980, noted dryly that board members did not have much of a choice but to pass the resolution -- and that by doing so did they hardly go out on a limb.</p>
        <p>''How can you be against motherhood and apple pie?'' he said. To meet terms of the consent decree, Mr. Timpone said that all the required bilingual sample ballots would be mailed out in advance of Wednesday's deadline, and that a Republican and a Democratic polling worker -- each bilingual -- had been recruited for all of the 140 polling places in the five communities involved.</p>
        <p>The consent decree also called for an outreach campaign to assure Hispanics they would be welcomed at the polls; Mr. Timpone estimated that more than half of the 11,433 new registered voters in the county since August were Hispanic. As of last week, there were 239,116 registered voters in the county, including 44,600 Republicans, 53,216 Democrats, 909 Independents and 140,391 undeclared voters.</p>
        <p>''They're not going to steal anything while I'm on the watch,'' vowed Rudy Filko, a Republican who was named county superintendent of elections in April.</p>
        <p>Under a separate suit filed against the city of Passaic in February, the Justice Department is seeking to replace the city's current form of government, in which each of the seven council members is elected by voters citywide in nonpartisan elections. The department has charged that a highly cohesive voting block of non-Hispanics has produced an ethnic makeup of the council disproportionate to the city's demographics.</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday night, the third game the World Series was getting under way when Narendra Trivedi was among 150 poll workers leaving Passaic City Hall after a training session attended by Mr. Timpone and county election officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trivedi, 50, who immigrated here from India and has been a United States  citizen for 15 years, said that he had never heard of voter discrimination in his native Bombay, and that he hardly expected to hear allegations of it in Passaic County.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised, yes indeed,'' said Mr. Trivedi. ''Because my understanding was it was always fair and no intimidation. But you realize it can happen.''</p>
