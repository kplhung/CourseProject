        <p>KEN COWING had always been proud to wear his scoutmaster uniform, but after a Supreme Court decision in June confirmed the Boy Scouts of America's policy excluding homosexuals, he thought about putting it away.</p>
        <p>''I felt awkward,'' he said. The Montclair Cub Scout leader said he worried that people thought he shared the organization's views when he wore the uniform. ''It was a creeping discomfort,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Cowing and other members of Cub Scout Pack 5 mailed a petition to the headquarters of the Boy Scouts of America in Irving, Texas. The petition, with 93 signatures, formally protests the Boy Scouts' ban on homosexual members, which Mr. Cowing said Pack 5 has no intention of following.</p>
        <p>''We had a unanimous decision that we would have a contrary policy,'' Mr. Cowing said. ''We welcome members and leaders regardless of their sexual orientation, race or religion.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey has been the center of attention since the Lambda Legal Defense Fund successfully challenged the Boy Scouts' policy banning homosexual members under the state's civil rights laws. The case, Dale v. Boy Scouts of America, involved a former Eagle Scout who applied for an assistant scoutmaster position with the Boy Scouts in Monmouth County. The scout, James Dale, was accepted for the position before he started college at Rutgers. At Rutgers, he became co-president of the university's Lesbian/Gay Alliance and was quoted in a newspaper discussing the need for homosexual role models for gay teenagers. Soon after, he received a letter from the Boy Scouts saying he was dismissed from the organization.</p>
        <p>In a 1999 decision, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts violated the state public accommodations laws by the dismissal. But in June, the United States Supreme Court held in a 5-4 decision that forcing the Boy Scouts to allow an admitted homosexual as an assistant scoutmaster would violate the organization's free-speech right to oppose homosexuality.</p>
        <p>''We have taught traditional American family values since we were founded in 1910,'' said Gregg Shields, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America. ''An avowed homosexual is not a role model in the Boy Scouts, and we don't extend leadership roles to avowed homosexuals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shields said there had been a few protests since the case was decided by the court, but he said the Scouts have received ''a tremendous amount of support'' from other areas.</p>
        <p>''The important thing is, we are growing and doing very well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Scouting leaders in New Jersey concurred. Ronald S. Green, director of the Boy Scouts Central New Jersey Council, said the policy had not affected the Scouts' ability to recruit or to work with New Jersey schools. He said people recognize that as a private organization the Boy Scouts ''have a right to set standards of membership.''</p>
        <p>Two chapters of the United Way in New Jersey have withdrawn funding from the Boy Scouts because of the policy, and others are ''monitoring the decision,'' said James E. Bourque, president of the Association of United Ways of New Jersey. United Way chapters in Somerset County and Essex County are not contributing to the Scouts this year, he said, and Monmouth County plans to review the funding next year.</p>
        <p>June M. Launay, marketing director for the United Way of Essex and Western Hudson Counties, said the organization asked all groups receiving funds to sign a nondiscrimination agreement.</p>
        <p>''The Boy Scouts opted not to take the funding,'' she said. ''Every other agency signed the agreement and has not had a problem with it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Launay said last year the Boy Scouts received $88,740 for youth programs. She said this year the money went to a similar program administered by the Boys and Girls Clubs.</p>
        <p>''Our issue was that the kids not lose services,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Philip Jones, a spokesman for the United Way of America, said 24 chapters out of 1,400 have withdrawn funding based on the decision. He said the national organization did not take policy positions, but offered training and support to the independent chapters.</p>
        <p>Jon Brennan, assistant scout executive for the Northern New Jersey Council of the Boy Scouts of America, said the scouts had seen a 20 percent growth in membership in the last year.</p>
        <p>''We have had some adults who said they do not agree with the policy,'' he said. ''But there has not been a major swell.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brennan said officials at two schools said they did not want the Scouts to use their buildings after the decision, but both rescinded the decision.</p>
        <p>''Parents want their youth in the scouting program, and they find value in the scouting program in their community,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mike Yaple, spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said the group had received ''a handful'' of calls from local boards. But he said the association has not taken a position on the issue.</p>
        <p>''Unless there is some guidance from the state Department of Education, it is an issue that should be handled at the local level,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Richard Vespucci, a spokesman for the Department of Education, said the department had not issued a position on the issue. Any such legal position would be made by the attorney general's office, which has also not made any statement.</p>
        <p>The lack of guidance from the state has left the decision to local school boards, most of which have not changed their positions. Dr. William Gussie, principal of Brigantine North Middle School, said the issue had ''never been discussed with me.''</p>
        <p>He said the Boy Scouts worked on projects with the students, but were one  among a large number of community groups that worked with the school.</p>
        <p>''The Boy Scouts don't hold meetings here, but periodically they come in to recruit and to talk to the kids about scouting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Scouts' position has also brought attention in some unexpected areas.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stuart D. Cook, president of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, was recently honored with the Boy Scouts' annual community service award for the school's work with children in Newark. Dr. Cook, who is a former Boy Scout, praised the legacy of the Scouts, but he criticized the organization's position on membership.</p>
        <p>''We must not close our doors to differing points of view, but rather work to bridge these differences,'' he said upon accepting the award. ''I urge the leaders of scouting here today and across the state to recognize these concerns and work to change.''</p>
        <p>He said that his thoughts about the Boy Scout award and conversation with other people at the university had led to the decision to order a review of the university's affirmative action program to improve the policy and ensure it offers protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>''Each of us has the opportunity every day to strengthen society's ability to do the right thing,'' Dr. Cook said. ''I hope our students know that if your goal is to be the best that you can be, you cannot do so if you have bias in your heart or hate in your mind.''</p>
