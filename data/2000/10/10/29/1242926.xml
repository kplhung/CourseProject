        <p>''Missing her,'' reads one of 200 fliers posted up and down the tree-lined streets of Park Slope. ''Have you seen her?''</p>
        <p>She is not a dog, or a cat, or a runaway girlfriend. She is a white pigeon named Baby One, and lest anyone think it futile to try to retrieve a wayward bird, be it noted that in the last two weeks, neighbors have called daily to report sightings.</p>
        <p>''I've been keeping a log,'' said Elizabeth Grajales, the resident of Carroll Street with whom Baby One had been living since July. ''Tuesday morning someone called and said, 'I think I saw your pigeon on Union and Fourth Avenue. Then someone from the zoo called and said a lot of pigeons come here for the feed.'' One caller offered to set traps on his roof. Another told her that in Eastern religions, pigeons transport souls to the other world.</p>
        <p>But so far, no one has found the bird that flew out of Ms. Grajales's garden on Oct. 17 as she was training it to recognize its home. Ms. Grajales, a ceramic tile maker and architecture student, theorized that Baby One was startled off her perch by a passing helicopter and then lost her way home.</p>
        <p>The disappearance is the latest episode in the story of 25 white pigeons Ms. Grajales found abandoned in Prospect Park in July. ''I was watching them die,'' she said of her daily visits to the flock. ''One got hit by a car. One died with her mate holding up her head.''</p>
        <p>Finally, during a torrential rainstorm, she decided to rescue them. A local policewoman, Leticia Rodriguez, offered to help, bringing in her own net and persuading the Parks Department to send a ranger with a tall ladder. They caught 10 of the birds, 6 of which later died of disease. The remaining four moved in with Ms. Grajales.</p>
        <p>The flock may have been released at a wedding or funeral, a practice Ms. Grajales said has lately become fashionable. ''Doves and pigeons have always been a symbol of love and peace,'' she said. ''It looks almost miraculous when all those white pigeons take off. But it's the most unloving act.''</p>
        <p>Such birds have been raised in coops, she said, and cannot survive  on their own. According to the state's  Department of Environmental Conservation, releasing them is illegal without a permit.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grajales said she planned to alert bird magazines, churches, synagogues and wedding planners to the evils of pigeon-releasing.</p>
        <p>''I even called the archdiocese,'' she said, ''to let people know this is a bad practice.''</p>
