        <p>It was for only a fleeting moment, but the questions inspired deep thought and a reflective poise on Matthew Kaphan's part, his mind sweeping whole epochs of history.</p>
        <p>Who was worth the most to him? To others? Whom would he be proud to take home, to show his friends? Who would make the best statement about what he valued in life?</p>
        <p>Who looked good?</p>
        <p>Without any concrete answers and only a few minutes to decide, he wondered: Gandhi, Marilyn Monroe or Prince Charles? Attila the Hun, Winston Churchill or Abraham Lincoln?</p>
        <p>Such were the concerns of the 100 or so people who gathered at Pier 92 on the West Side of Manhattan yesterday, as they did their best to outsmart and outbid each other on the array of life-size wax statues at auction, closeouts from a small museum in Vermont.</p>
        <p>So rare is such an event that Robert Houston drove from Philadelphia to be there. Several bidders called in from remote locations on cell phones. And Norman Brosterman, an Upper West Side antiques dealer and author, called it ''the opportunity of a lifetime; that is, if you're into this kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>And they were.</p>
        <p>By the aficionados' own admissions, the world of wax figure collectors must be incredibly small. That was evident when Mr. Houston, 60, recalled how ''about 10 or 12 years ago, I missed out on this great wax figure of Martin Luther King from the Coney Island Wax Works.''</p>
        <p>As he shook his head, amused and still obviously a little bit miffed, the man sitting next to him said, ''Hey, I got that statue! What a coincidence! What are the chances?''</p>
        <p>Pretty good, actually.</p>
        <p>The man was Mr. Kaphan, who  decided this time that Prince Charles was worth $175.</p>
        <p>''It's a highly specialized area of interest,'' Mr. Brosterman said, stressing the word ''highly,'' clearing his throat, and giving a facetious grin to his client and friend Mark Chiarello, a wax museum enthusiast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chiarello was quick to add, ''Hey, I'm not some kind of freak.'' He paused to look a few statues over, then said, ''Do you think the kids would mind Albert Einstein in the living room?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chiarello and his wife, Cathy, didn't buy anything yesterday, but Mr. Kaphan said he found some real bargains. Two hundred and twenty-five dollars for Gandhi. George Washington for the same amount.</p>
        <p>But the greatest deal, he said, was Prince Charles: ''He's going to be the next king of England.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaphan, a retired bagel store owner from Long Island, couldn't help but wonder what the prince would be worth then.</p>
        <p>Asked what he planned to do with all this history in wax, he said, ''Oh, just put them around.''</p>
        <p>That seemed to be what most people planned to do.</p>
        <p>''They conjure up memories,'' said Mr. Houston, a retired customer service representative at a Philadelphia utility. ''You just look in the face of any one of them and it happens. It's exciting.''</p>
        <p>The auction had an undeniably festive air. Vintage circus paraphernalia and carousel animals and parts were also on the block. They turned Pier 92 into a wonderland.</p>
        <p>The carousel pieces, on average, commanded much higher bids than the wax figures at what Guernsey's, the auction house, titled a ''Fairground'' auction. One elegant carousel giraffe fetched $17,000.</p>
        <p>But it was the wax figures that lent a surreal feeling to the occasion, and ''really made the whole thing a lot of fun,'' said Paul Gutheil, a freelance photographer from Glen Rock, N.J., who is also a member of the Circus Fans Association of America.</p>
        <p>The figures were posed with their backs to the glass walls, looking out at the crowd. On first sight, they fooled a number of people.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'Isn't this open to everybody? Why are those people standing in line over there?' '' Mr. Kaphan said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Collections of wax figures sometimes end up at auction when wax museums or exhibits close, which is why they are relatively rare. The 80 pieces offered yesterday came from the private collection of Aet Singer, a Brooklyn Heights sculptor and painter who began buying the figures in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>It began as a hobby, but soon the statues were crowding her out of her studio, so she opened a public exhibition in Vermont. But after a few years, she realized that running the museum while living in New York was becoming too difficult. The Vermont Wax Museum closed in 1998. It was also less than a moneymaking venture. So with bills to pay, Ms. Singer decided to auction the statues.</p>
        <p>''It's like giving up your toys,'' she said. ''But what makes me happy is that now people will be able to enjoy them individually in their own homes or offices. They are great conversation pieces.''</p>
        <p>Already, even before leaving the pier, they had inspired a few laughs. Perhaps the greatest was when one of the auctioneers couldn't find Marco Polo.</p>
