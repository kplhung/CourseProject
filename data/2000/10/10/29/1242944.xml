        <p>Third-party candidates, on both the left and the right, have almost always talked about trying, one way or another, to purify existing system, which they regard as hopelessly corrupt; Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader fits firmly into this tradition; but, with exception of Republican Party, which crowded out Whigs, no third party has demonstrated much staying power; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THERE is no obvious ideological line that connects Ralph Nader to H. Ross Perot, Robert M. LaFollette, George C. Wallace, Theodore Roosevelt, John B. Anderson, Eugene V. Debs, Strom Thurmond and many of the other independent and third-party candidates who have mounted notable campaigns for the presidency in the course of American history. But comparing the issues these candidates ran on is not the only way to assess just what it is they were trying to appeal to in the electorate. And to many historians, there is at least one prism through which they appear remarkably similar.</p>
        <p>''Looking at these things in only a left-to-right way sort of misses the point,'' said Bruce J. Schulman, director of American Studies at Boston University. ''Third-party candidates almost always have talked about trying to purify the system in some way. They talk about the existing system as hopelessly corrupt; they say you need to clean it up one way or the other. So you can look at these things not so much as left versus right, but clean versus dirty.''</p>

        <p>THERE is no obvious ideological line that connects Ralph Nader to H. Ross Perot, Robert M. LaFollette, George C. Wallace, Theodore Roosevelt, John B. Anderson, Eugene V. Debs, Strom Thurmond and many of the other independent and third-party candidates who have mounted notable campaigns for the presidency in the course of American history. But comparing the issues these candidates ran on is not the only way to assess just what it is they were trying to appeal to in the electorate. And to many historians, there is at least one prism through which they appear remarkably similar.</p>
        <p>''Looking at these things in only a left-to-right way sort of misses the point,'' said Bruce J. Schulman, director of American Studies at Boston University. ''Third-party candidates almost always have talked about trying to purify the system in some way. They talk about the existing system as hopelessly corrupt; they say you need to clean it up one way or the other. So you can look at these things not so much as left versus right, but clean versus dirty.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, many of these candidates have  somehow invoked an image of purity, a sense that they were fighting a system that is corrupt to the core, and Mr. Nader, the consumer advocate and Green Party presidential nominee, fits firmly into this tradition. It has frequently been the two-party system itself that these candidates have cast as the villain, thus, of course, offering the rationale for a new party.</p>
        <p>''The belief that the political system is corrupt fuels all the third-party candidates in our political history,'' said Zachary Karabell, author of ''The Last Campaign: How Harry Truman Won the 1948 Election'' (Knopf), a contest in which Mr. Thurmond, the states' rights ''Dixiecrat'' candidate and Henry A. Wallace, the Progressive Party nominee who wrote ''Toward World Peace,'' occupied an important place on the stage, though each got only 2.4 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>''They may not have used the exact phrase, but both Wallace and Thurmond would certainly have referred to the two major parties as Republicrats, '' said Mr. Karabell, using the term Mr. Nader has repeatedly voiced in this campaign to persuade voters that there is little difference between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas (whom he has also  called ''Gush and Bore''). And Mr. Nader's construction that the major-party candidates are ''Tweedledum and Tweedledee'' is also not new in American politics.</p>
        <p>In almost all cases, whether they were arguing against civil rights or for economic rights, these candidates have hearkened back to the founding fathers and invoked a time of purer ideals and thoughts. The phrase ''sweeping the rascals out'' dates to the 1870's, when a breakaway group of liberal Republicans ran against what they depicted as the corruption of the age. The populist People's Party Platform of 1892 bemoaned that corruption ''dominates the ballot box, the legislatures, the Congress'' and ''touches even the ermine of the bench.''</p>
        <p>And it's surely no coincidence that Mr. Perot, who captured 18.9 percent of the vote for the Reform Party in 1992 one of the most successful showings of a third-party candidate in history, often vowed to ''clean out the stables'' if the American people sent him to the White House. Images of corruption were a part of the Perot playbook. When he went to Valley Forge, Pa., to launch his second run for the presidency, in 1996, he denounced the two-party system and vowed to ''kill that little snake this time.''</p>
        <p>While George Wallace's and Mr. Thurmond's campaigns are often depicted in the negative -- as against civil rights -- the candidates themselves told fellow Southerners that they were battling oppressive forces in the nation's capital out to dictate their way of life.</p>
        <p>Of course, an obvious question comes to mind: why haven't any of these candidates been more successful? No third-party candidate has ever won (Mr. Roosevelt, the ex-president who ran as the ''Bull Moose'' Progressive Party candidate in 1912, came closest, with 27.4 percent of the vote).</p>
        <p>And with the exception of the Republican Party, which came to crowd out the Whigs as the pre-eminent challenger to the Democrats, no third party seems to have ever really survived. And now, Mr. Perot's Reform Party is clearly teetering: its nominee, Patrick J. Buchanan, seems unlikely to get much traction in this presidential race.</p>
        <p>One reason for the failure of third parties is that however messy the two-party system is, a major party almost always finds a way to co-opt at least some of the themes offered by any third party that generate appeal. By the time of the New Deal, for example, Democrats had appropriated some of the planks of Mr. LaFollette, the Wisconsin senator who got 16.6 percent of the vote as the Progressive nominee in 1924. Republicans like Richard M. Nixon defused Mr. Wallace's appeal and made inroads into the once solidly Democratic South.</p>
        <p>But there may be an even simpler reason why so many third parties have had trouble catching on permanently.</p>
        <p>''They're Jeremiahs, talking about purging the Republic of sin and corruption,'' said David M. Kennedy, a Stanford University history professor and the author of ''Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945'' (Oxford University), which won the Pulitzer Prize for history this year. ''What all these movements have so strikingly in common is that they're anti-establishment. They position themselves as outsiders who really in a sense don't make any serious argument about wanting to become an established party. They're outside the traditional framework, so sometimes they're not built to last, even in their own minds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader and many of his supporters might dispute that, arguing that the main goal of his candidacy at this point is not to win but to capture the 5 percent of the vote needed to qualify for federal funds in the next presidential election cycle and thus build up the Green Party as an enduring force.</p>
        <p>Still, a large part of Mr. Nader's appeal is clearly the notion of where he fits on the clean-versus-dirty spectrum. In interviews in Portland, Ore., last week, where support for Mr. Nader is strong, many voters described him as incorruptible or virtuous, or said they were following their ''conscience.''  ''I just trust Nader,'' said Danielle DeDee, a sales clerk at a craft gallery. ''He seems so honest. I mean, look at his lifestyle. He lives on, like, what, $25,000 a year? He gives away something like 80 percent of his money.''</p>
        <p>Many Democrats, of course, are furious with Mr. Nader, and Vice President Gore went so far as to depict him as a pawn, unwitting or not, of big business. In doing so, Mr. Gore was trying to cloak himself in the purer-than-thou mantle that has often been worn by the third-party candidates.</p>
        <p>''If the big oil companies and chemical manufacturers and the other big polluters were able to communicate a message to this state, they would say vote for George Bush or, in any case, vote for Ralph Nader,'' Mr. Gore told a crowd in Wisconsin last week. ''They would say whatever you do, don't vote for Al Gore.''</p>
