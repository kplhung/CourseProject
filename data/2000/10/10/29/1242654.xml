        <p>HE'S 27, a biker, the son of a Lutheran minister turned prison warden. He lives in a small fourth-floor walkup on the Upper West Side of Manhattan; ''my penthouse,''  he calls it. In the bedroom, he keeps a top-of-the-line D.J. station so he can mix music, mostly reggae, in his down time. He doesn't touch caffeine, drinks alcohol only on special occasions and is a vegetarian ''because it makes me feel lighter, less aggressive.'' He loves his two Harley-Davidson motorcycles, but in town he generally moves around on foot or by subway, traveling light, ''with just my Metrocard and a little money,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Onstage, however, he is Ethan Stiefel, the American Ballet Theater star whom The New Yorker has called ''probably the most advanced male ballet dancer in the world.'' A presence in both pop life and the world of art, he moves from beefcake shots in the British Vogue and Vanity Fair to guest appearances at Covent Garden in London and the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires. Last week, when Mr. Stiefel's first film, ''Center Stage,'' was released on video and DVD, he was preparing for his debut on Tuesday as the lead in Balanchine's ''Prodigal Son'' with the American Ballet Theater at City Center.</p>
        <p>The Ballet Theater season is, in fact, a comeback for Mr. Stiefel, who hasn't danced in New York for almost a year. During his absence from the stage, however, his image was everywhere, especially in the run-up to the ''Center Stage'' premiere in May and in Ballet Theater advertisements. His appearances during the company's season at the Metropolitan Opera House, from May through July, were regularly advertised almost until the bitter end, by which time he had canceled them all, one by one.</p>
        <p>What happened to him? Today, to his relief, Mr. Stiefel believes he understands. Making ''Center Stage,'' during what would have been his summer layoff from Ballet Theater last year, involved long hours and take after take of virtuoso passages that in the theater would have been the climax of an evening. Last year, brash and pumped during the filming, he said he had the situation under control.</p>
        <p>''In the theater, where everything is focused on your show,'' he says, ''you just concern yourself with getting through your day and peaking for those three hours onstage. I try to completely relax and keep it very light and then'' -- he snaps his fingers -- ''bang! Like a wild animal.'' But for the movie, he continues, ''You have to just say, 'Right now I've got to go full blast, and now it's over and there's nothing I can do, I've just got to wait around and go full blast the next time.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stiefel now says he could ''barely walk for two or three days'' after the filming. But he kept going full blast, dancing with Ballet Theater in the fall season at City Center. He made guest appearances abroad, including his debut in January with the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden in London, dancing a piece by Twyla Tharp and returning as Franz in the February revival of ''Coppelia.'' A Sunday Telegraph reviewer said the young American ''danced every step with chastening magnificence''; he has been invited to return next February.</p>
        <p>In London, however, Mr. Stiefel came down with flu and bronchitis. Nevertheless, he reshot some film scenes, rehearsed with Ballet Theater and made guest appearances. But by April he had a fever he could not shake and increasingly suffered from fatigue. At the premiere of the film, which he attended with his girlfriend, the regal young Ballet Theater soloist Gillian Murphy, he was weak and feverish. Mr. Stiefel said blood tests finally detected evidence of  mononucleosis, though he was sure it was also a case of plain burnout. ''For five months I was basically flat on my back,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Kevin McKenzie, the artistic director of American Ballet Theater, says they agreed that the company would schedule his appearances during the summer run at the Met, reviewing the situation periodically as the performances approached. Mr. McKenzie says of their meetings: ''It's horrible to have somebody sitting in front of you who's sick, and dealing with disappointment and obviously dealing with depression. Ethan would say, 'Not yet,' and we would start letting things go. We just kept going like that for the season.''</p>
        <p>The fact that offstage Mr. Stiefel's glamour disappears means that he was able to recuperate in peace, spending as much time as he liked at the Pennsylvania home of his parents, avoiding the theater, answering his fan mail for the film (''maybe five or six letters a month,'' he says), mixing music. He even ate a little meat.</p>
        <p>Pale and slim even when he is in top form, Mr. Stiefel was born in Pennsylvania and raised in Texas and Wisconsin. He is, says Judy Kinberg, who is directing and producing a PBS documentary about Mr. Stiefel and three other Ballet Theater dancers, ''a blue-eyed, blond, Midwestern, white-bread kind of presence.'' PBS shot a sequence at Mr. Stiefel's first ballet school, the Monona Academy of Dance, outside Madison, Wis., ''It's in a strip mall!'' Ms. Kinberg says.</p>
        <p>But when critics call him the finest young American ballet dancer today, which can be balletspeak for ''he's no Russian,'' Mr. Stiefel bridles a bit. Almost instinctively, he has made every effort to avoid local stylization or affectation in his work. In fact, soon after he entered the School of American Ballet at 14, he balked at ''limiting myself to one idiom of ballet'' and sought out Mikhail Baryshnikov's training program, the School of Classical Ballet at Ballet Theater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baryshnikov was important to Mr. Stiefel's development as a dancer, but it is Peter Martins, the ballet master in chief of the New York City Ballet, who made Mr. Stiefel's career, inviting him to join the City Ballet corps at 16. Mr. Stiefel danced for the company until 1992, when he was 19, and then left for the Zurich Ballet. A year later, he was back at City Ballet as a soloist; and three years later, a principal, he left again, for good this time, and joined Ballet Theater. Recently, while working on his role in ''Prodigal Son,'' Mr. Stiefel recalled asking for time off to dance elsewhere in what proved to be his final negotiation with Mr. Martins. ''There's still a lot that I want to do here,'' he remembers telling Mr. Martins, ''but something is driving me to try something else. Peter said, 'It's a hard decision, but if you didn't want to do what you're asking me to do I would be more concerned.' And we shook hands. Peter was a big man in the sense that he didn't shut me out after that. Before I left, he let me do 'Apollo' on that stage.''</p>
        <p>At Ballet Theater, Mr. Stiefel found himself in some respects a novice again. The ballerina Susan Jaffe says: ''When I started working with Ethan, he had never done big classical partnering, like those inside whip turns in 'Don Q.,' so he was really intimidated. But he's a sponge: he's curious, he's hungry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stiefel says he has to pay special attention to partnering. ''I'm not big-boned. I'm very lightweight, and I have small feet, so I don't have a big base. I have to be mistake-free in my placement. In rehearsals I have to be somewhat calculating, figure out where I need to be, how this is going to work.''</p>
        <p>BUT he says the partnering in the crude and cruel seduction scene with the Siren in ''The Prodigal Son'' is just a matter of brute strength, ''like weight lifting: clean jerk.'' For him, the muscular effort recalls a famous interpreter of the role, Edward Villella, whom he admiringly calls ''a carnivore.'' The effect is ''like seeing a gymnast do the iron cross or watching Greco-Roman wrestling,''  Mr. Stiefel says with relish. As for a famous moment in which, from a seated position, he balances the Siren on the front of his shins, he says, ''It becomes very sporting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stiefel doesn't blink at the thought of making his comeback in this taxing role, which is regarded as a rite of passage for the male dancer. ''The arc of energy in this ballet is like 'Giselle,' '' he says. ''After I get beat up, I'm going to let myself go: fall into the abyss. It's like when you're playing soldier as a kid, the most fun is, how many ways can you blow yourself up?</p>
        <p>''This is the way I want to come back,'' he says emphatically. ''If I can't give my all, what am I going to do? I'm going to be there, ready to go, that's my motivation. Besides, what would I rather do? I couldn't have cast it better myself. It'll be very cool when I break through the curtains for the first time: 'Here I am!' ''</p>
