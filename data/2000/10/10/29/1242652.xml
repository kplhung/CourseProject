        <p>THE usual jangled nerves and pre-performance chaos were noticeably absent backstage at the Maison de la Danse last month when the Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan meditated and practiced tai chi while waiting for the curtain to rise. Repeated chants of ''om'' could be heard in the music playing throughout the theater as the cast and crew prepared to present ''Songs of the Wanderers'' by the company's artistic director, Lin Hwai-Min.</p>
        <p>The same kind of calming preparation will precede ''Songs of the Wanderers'' when it opens the first of its four performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music  on Wednesday as part of the Next Wave festival. Mr. Lin found inspiration for the piece, a 90-minute exploration of the idea of pilgrimage, during several visits to India, where he meditated at the site of Buddha's enlightenment in Bodhgaya and had a spiritual awakening of his own.</p>
        <p>''When I was coming out of my meditation, before I opened my eyes, I sensed a stream of sunshine on my forehead,'' he said in an interview at his hotel here. ''It was such a wonderful peacefulness. And I went home and in three weeks 'Songs of the Wanderers' was created, and somehow it does retain that sense of serenity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lin also drew on ''Siddhartha,'' the Hermann Hesse novel in which the protagonist explores different religions in his search for enlightenment. (''Songs of the Wanderers'' is the Chinese title for ''Siddhartha.'') In the piece, which had its premiere in Taiwan in 1994, Mr. Lin creates abstract representations of various religious rituals, including those of the sadhus, holy men of India, and the practitioners of qi gong, a Chinese system of physical and spiritual exercises.</p>
        <p>''I discovered that in all civilizations there is a quest for peace through different forms of practice,'' Mr. Lin said. ''In all kinds of religions they have music and pageant to create a sense of peacefulness, and I think this is what this work is doing.''</p>
        <p>In preparation for ''Songs of the Wanderers,'' the Cloud Gate dancers studied meditation for more than three years, then applied it in the creation of the hauntingly slow, controlled movements of the work. ''As they were coming out of the meditative state, I asked the dancers to keep their eyes closed and improvise,'' Mr. Lin said. ''This is very different from improvising with your eyes open, because you are led by your internal energy. Like tai chi, the movement in 'Songs of the Wanderers' is very soft and strong, focused inward and circular.''</p>
        <p>''Songs of the Wanderers'' was conceived without music, but when Mr. Lin was given a tape of Georgian folk songs, he was struck by how naturally the two fit together. ''I like the music because it has a spiritual quality that is soulful,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the work's opening, a man dressed in a monk's robe stands with his hands in a position of prayer under a narrow stream of rice that rains upon him and accumulates at his feet. He remains motionless and unflinching throughout the piece as the grains ricochet off him, maintaining a monumental stillness that requires a high level of mental stamina, which he learned from meditation. Behind him, pilgrims appear and glide slowly forward, carrying large walking sticks and approaching a foot-high twisting river of rice that snakes across the stage. They cup the rice in their hands, as if making an offering, and then dive into the river, spreading the grains across the stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lin's choreography combines the athleticism of modern dance and ballet with the stylized movements of Chinese opera and the focused strength of tai chi. Although he studied modern dance while attending the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa (he was a best-selling novelist in Taiwan before he founded Cloud Gate in 1973) and at the Martha Graham School in New York, Mr. Lin's work is strongly influenced by his Taiwanese heritage.</p>
        <p>He spent his childhood watching the harvesting and drying of rice, a central element in ''Songs of the Wanderers.''</p>
        <p>''I think there is something psychological about it,'' he said. ''Rice is sacred in Asia. When we were children, rice was everything. Farmers would spread the rice in the courtyard or even on the road to let it dry. It held such a great fascination, but if you were caught playing with it you really got in trouble, because you were ruining the food.'' More than three tons of rice, dried and dyed gold, fall during the course of the piece (none of it edible any longer, most of it gathered up and re-used).</p>
        <p>The rice, along with being manipulated onstage into a river, also becomes a desert, a waterfall, a mountain, rain and, as it falls on the monk, even an hourglass that marks the passage of time. The dancers push it, roll in it, play with it and throw it, extending the line of their movements in giant arcs. It also creates a continuous rustling as it pours over the monk.</p>
        <p>''The steady rain is in the back of your mind, even if you don't look at it,'' said Mr. Lin. ''In the pauses between music, the sound of falling rice comes out to remind you about time. Just like a river, it keeps going, whatever happens, that is life.''</p>
        <p>Rivers, a constant source of fascination for Mr. Lin, appear in much of his work. (His ''Nine Songs,'' which features a flickering stream of candles, will be performed at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center today.) ''All of those rivers, the Ganges, the river in front of my window in Taipei and the river outside the holy temple in Bodhgaya, led me into 'Songs of the Wanderers,' '' he said. ''When I went to Bodhgaya in 1994, it was monsoon time and the river was full of mud. It looked like a carpet. It didn't move, but there were bubbles coming up from the bottom. I realized that there is tremendous strength underneath. It was only two years after the premiere that I realized what it meant to me in the work, the movement looks so slow and serene, but actually it is very tense.''</p>
        <p>The stillness of the river is echoed in the monk, whose meditation demonstrates yet another method of seeking inner peace. ''For me, looking at him is like the river outside the Bodhgaya compound,'' Mr. Lin said. ''When I sat there, I felt 2,500 years pass just like a snap.''</p>
        <p>The pilgrims' controlled movements, so slow they are barely perceptible, are followed by the violent writhing of a woman with long, flowing hair, whose presence in the work, Mr. Lin said, was initially inspired by the character of Kamala, a prostitute who found enlightenment on her deathbed with the assistance of Siddhartha. A lone figure bearing a rake crisscrosses the stage throughout the work, a reference to the old boatman in the book, Siddhartha's last teacher. This is not a retelling of the Siddhartha story, however.</p>
        <p>''In the end, people do not have to read Hesse's 'Siddhartha,' do not have to understand anything about it when they see this work,'' Mr. Lin said. ''I think the energy of the dancers takes over and communicates and the audience is drawn into it and, if it's a good performance, the audience is carried through a journey.''</p>
        <p>THE journey of the pilgrims, wearing white makeup and wrapped in stained white cotton fabric that Mr. Lin found in India, is punctuated by the exploration of different religious practices. Dancers enter with green-leafed branches, a startling contrast in the pale setting, and flagellate themselves like penitents.</p>
        <p>''That is what trancers do,'' Mr. Lin explained, ''but actually they use very heavy metal objects with prongs, and it is really bloody.'' Another section includes dancers with clay bowls containing fire balanced on their heads, a variation of the sadhus's practice of carrying bowls of hot coals on their heads.</p>
        <p>As the bowls are carried off, the dancers rise and begin to spin, stamping their feet, an allusion to qi gong, not to whirling dervishes. ''Qi gong practitioners don't claim to be dancers, but when their energy is opened up they just have to let it go,'' Mr. Lin said. ''And that turning, spinning, is really directing the energy up. They are not dervishes; dervishes turn in the opposite direction.'' As the dancers spin amid the downpour of rice, they exult, running, jumping and tossing the grains.</p>
        <p>Although the deluge ceases and the dancers emerge to acknowledge the applause, the performance is not yet over. During the bows, the dancer holding the rake starts to create a spiral out of the rice outward from center stage. He slowly creates a beautiful Zen garden, spiraling out to infinity. Once again Mr. Lin depicts a quest for spiritual enlightenment, in this case highlighting its unending nature: The program labels this section ''The end or the beginning?''</p>
