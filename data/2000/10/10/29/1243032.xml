        <p>They are regarded throughout the National Basketball Association as the Knicks' weakness. Hardly anyone expects the team to rebound, to score, to stay healthy or to defend adequately in Patrick Ewing's absence.</p>
        <p>Even the Knicks' management has shown a lack of faith, first aggressively pursuing Brian Grant to help bolster the front court and now chasing Joe Smith.</p>
        <p>But during the preseason, Larry Johnson, Marcus Camby and Kurt Thomas have been impressive. Not only have they made up for the loss of Ewing's 9.7 rebound a game, but they have also turned the Knicks into a better rebounding team than they were a year ago.</p>
        <p>Coming off a season in which the team finished 24th in the league in overall rebounding and last on the offensive boards, the Knicks have outrebounded opponents by an average of more than five rebounds a game in the preseason. The Knicks were most impressive on the offensive glass, grabbing nearly three more rebounds a game than the opposition.</p>
        <p>Will it continue when the real thing begins Tuesday in the season opener against the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden? Who knows, but right now the Knicks are hoping that pride will continue to fuel their progress on the backboards.</p>
        <p>''We know that everybody thinks that we're not a rebounding team, and the guys on the front line are taking it personal,'' Thomas said. ''As a result, we're being real aggressive on the boards. Last year, we had the big guy in there. Patrick was rebounding the ball for us so the rest of us didn't take as many chances. But now it's not just one guy rebounding. It's all of us.''</p>
        <p>Of course, when talking about the Knicks' front line, health is always an issue, and the early signs are not good. After banging with the Washington Wizards' Jahidi White for about 20 minutes on Oct. 16, Camby began to experience lower back pain. He played through it for more than a week, but sat out Friday's final preseason game at San Antonio. He is listed as day to day.</p>
        <p>Camby, who inherited Ewing's starting spot at center, has led the Knicks in rebounding with an 8.1 average, while Thomas (7.8) and Johnson (7.2) followed. And those numbers were recorded while playing fewer than 28 minutes a game. If the Knicks rebound as well in the regular season, it will enable them to run more and get easy baskets in transition and on second shots. They were poor in those areas last season.</p>
        <p>But there is more to playing on the front line than just rebounding. There is scoring from the low block, passing out of double teams and defending, and those are areas of major concern for Coach Jeff Van Gundy.</p>
        <p>Among the Knicks' big men, and they include the reserves Luc Longley (who will return in three weeks from a bruised right knee) and Travis Knight, only Johnson and Thomas are offensive threats in the post. Johnson is strong down low because of his quickness, his moves and the ability to pass effectively when double-teamed.</p>
        <p>''What I like about Larry is that he's a very unselfish player and he's not going to take bad shots,'' Don Chaney, a Knicks assistant, said. ''He's still forceful enough inside to force a double team, and I think his statistics will definitely pick up this season.''</p>
        <p>Johnson, who at 6 feet 7 inches is one of the league's smallest power forwards, will have the added challenge of facing the opposition's toughest post defender, a burden that used to be reserved for Ewing. Johnson, however, said that should work in his favor.</p>
        <p>''I hope I draw the biggest post defender,'' he said. ''That's easy for me: I just turn and face him. It's the guys my size that give me the most trouble because they're just as quick and my face-up game is not as effective. If I get a big guy on me who's 6-10, 6-11, 7 feet, I turn and face him and I've got plenty of options. He's going to have to back up, then I can make my jumper, and if he don't back up, I can go around him.''</p>
        <p>Thomas is relatively unproven in the post, and he will have to show enough scoring ability to command a double team. From there, he will have to learn to hit the open man, something he is weak at right now.</p>
        <p>With Camby, Johnson and Latrell Sprewell on the front line, the Knicks have the smallest starting unit in the league, with an average height of 6-6. That presents a potential problem with help defense in the post, where larger opponents may be able to shoot easily over the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''That's what worries me over time about being small,'' Van Gundy said. ''If you're a bigger team being a count late with your help is O.K. because you can block a shot or alter a shot. But when you're a small team and you're coming over to help with 6-foot-5 guys, you're going to give up layups and free throws. So as a small team we have to know what our strengths are and be a count early on defense. If we're not, we're going to give up a lot of free throws and easy baskets.''</p>
        <p>There is a lot of room for improvement, but still, Camby, Johnson and Thomas have shown that they may be better than expected.</p>
