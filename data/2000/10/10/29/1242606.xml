        <p>Fifth Quarter</p>
        <p>The Scrimmage of a Football Coach's Daughter.</p>
        <p>By Jennifer Allen.</p>
        <p>Random House, $23.95.</p>
        <p>When the legendary football coach George Allen died in 1990, his three sons planned the memorial service, choosing the burial clothes, the pallbearers and the guest speakers. But they did not ask their younger sister, Jennifer, to speak. As one brother said, ''We weren't honoring a father, we were honoring a coach.'' In her memoir, ''Fifth Quarter,'' Jennifer Allen describes growing up as George Allen's only daughter. The story begins in 1968, when Allen was fired as the head coach of the Los Angeles Rams, and it focuses on the highlights of Allen's chaotic career in the National Football League (he was fired three times by the Rams and once by the Washington Redskins), showing the effects on him and his family. Although Jennifer occasionally ignores dates and chronology, making her story sometimes hard to follow, she paints a vibrant, sympathetic picture of her mother, who looked like Elizabeth Taylor ''on good days,'' and of George Allen as father, ''the loneliest man on earth . . . sipping his milk'' and as coach, ''lifted high above all fans, transported like a king, on the shoulders of two mammoth Redskins'' after a conference championship in 1972. Her tone is lighthearted and rarely probes below the surface. The most evocative section occurs on the final pages, when Allen describes what led her to write the book. In some of her father's papers, he wrote at the end of his N.F.L. career that he was disappointed that he had not been admitted to the Hall of Fame. Jennifer had also felt unwanted, and reading about her father's struggles made her feel connected to him and ''more complete.'' Unfortunately she offers little insight into her father's interior life, or her own, making her book feel more like a highlight film than a memoir.</p>
