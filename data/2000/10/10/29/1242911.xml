        <p>MICHAEL R. BURNS, an investment banker turned Internet entrepreneur and studio executive, was talking about his role as vice chairman at Lions Gate Entertainment -- specifically, the company's desire to become a major player in independent films -- when his thoughts suddenly switched gears.</p>
        <p>''Where's 'Blair Witch 2' trading?'' he asked from a conference room in the building that houses the Hollywood Stock Exchange, whose hsx.com Internet site lets players trade shares of movies, celebrities and music using ''Hollywood dollars.''</p>
        <p>Hsx.com is a game, but Mr. Burns, who was a co-founder of the exchange along with a friend, Max Keiser, is betting that trading on the site will become a significant leading indicator of box-office prospects. And that will provide valuable marketing research material.</p>
        <p>It is natural for ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,'' which opened in theaters this weekend, to come to mind as he discusses his goal of positioning Lions Gate as a film industry ''minimajor.'' ''The Blair Witch Project'' brought Artisan Entertainment, the company that bought distribution rights to it for $1 million, over $150 million last summer, elevating Artisan to the ranks of major Hollywood players.</p>
        <p>''Book of Shadows'' will be closely watched to see if it can replicate the success of ''Blair Witch.'' Because it was trading at about ''H$56,'' players on the Hollywood Stock Exchange were betting that the film would gross at least $56 million in North America in its first four weeks. By comparison, the top movie stocks on the exchange were ''Star Wars: Episode II,'' trading at H$157.88; ''Lord of the Rings,'' at H$119.67; and ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' at H$111.44 -- signaling much higher expectations.</p>
        <p>For two decades, Mr. Burns, who is 42 and grew up in New Canaan, Conn., honed his business skills as an investment banker. He was with Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York and Los Angeles from 1983 through 1991, then joined Prudential Securities as a managing director in Los Angeles in 1991. Much of his work involved European and other international broadcasting deals, including a role as lead banker when the Scandinavia Broadcasting System, for which he had raised more than $500 million, went public in 1993.</p>
        <p>More recently, Mr. Burns has planted his feet in two new worlds, both involving entertainment:  the virtual world of the Hollywood Stock Exchange and the real world of studio-building.</p>
        <p>''I like the idea of creating assets that last forever,'' he said when asked about his career move. ''And I love movies.''</p>
        <p>While working to make the Hollywood Stock Exchange a success, Mr. Burns is overseeing a financial restructuring at Lions Gate, which recently concluded the $50 million acquisition of Trimark Pictures, a small Los Angeles film studio.</p>
        <p>''He's enthusiastic and always looking for new challenges,'' said Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, who is now developing Internet ventures including a deal with Mr. Burns at the Hollywood Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Mr. Burns and Mr. Keiser, whom he knew from Shearson, teamed up to form the Hollywood Stock Exchange. They initially conceived it as a company that would allow film studios to hedge their risks by selling futures or options contracts, perhaps similar to those based on gold or other precious metals. The idea did not work, he said, because there is no deliverable commodity like bullion.</p>
        <p>But with the emergence of the Internet, they saw an opportunity to design something similar.  Building on the idea of a stock exchange, they created a Wall Street-like site that would allow participants to trade in ''stocks'' of movies, celebrities and music. A dollar of stock value translates into $1 million in box-office earnings, for example.</p>
        <p>Based in West Hollywood on busy Santa Monica Boulevard, the company has gone so far as to place on the outside of the building a ticker that streams information about the ''prices'' at which movies and celebrities are trading. Although the exchange initially included a film development and production business, it was spun off into a company called Ignite, leaving the exchange to focus on Internet possibilities.</p>
        <p>In March, they went back to their original idea, and the site offered consumers an opportunity to share in the profits of a movie -- ''American Psycho'' (produced by Lions Gate) -- by using Hollywood dollars to buy Audience Participation Notes. Had the movie grossed more than $20 million in four weeks, the formula dictated, everyone who bought shares would have split $20,000 of the film's proceeds. The box office take fell short of that mark, however, and there was no payoff. But if it had grossed $20 million, the 1,000 people who participated would have received $20 each.</p>
        <p>This month, they are taking the idea a step further, offering consumers willing to put down real money the opportunity to buy into another Lions Gate release, ''Shadow of the Vampire,'' starring John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe. For $50, consumers can become virtual executive producers for the film's disc version, get their names in the DVD credits and receive screening invitations and other bonuses.</p>
        <p>If the movie grosses more than $10 million in its first month, the virtual producers will share $150,000 and the amount goes up with the gross. In the three weeks since the offer began, more than 800 people have subscribed.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Burns would like to develop the idea into a real film-financing vehicle. But for now, it is essentially a marketing and research tool. On one level, the idea is that someone who buys into a movie will go see it and encourage friends to do the same. At the same time, companies can derive information about a film's prospects based on consumer trading.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Burns said, a major fast-food retailer planning its promotions -- he declined to name it -- recently contacted the company to see what is popular on the exchange that will released in 2001. In January, the Hollywood Stock Exchange plans to start selling its research findings on a subscription basis.</p>
        <p>But in developing the Internet site, Mr. Burns and Mr. Keiser -- who have received some $35 million in venture capital for it -- are facing the same hurdles as other as Internet companies that have watched as investors cooled to cyberspace deals.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly as challenging an experience today as I've ever seen,'' Mr. Burns said. Still, he added, he had no regrets about his shift away from his investment banking career.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of an evolution,'' he said, ''and it's nice to be evolving.''</p>
