        <p>ONE way to transform an ordinary rectangular doorway into a dramatic entryway is by adding an arch. Creating an arch entails building a wooden frame, attaching it to the header and jambs, then covering it with drywall. Be aware that the arch will lower the top of the entryway by an inch or two.</p>
        <p>Start by drawing the curve of the arch on a wide sheet of three-quarter-inch thick plywood. Most entry arches usually curve in the shape of a wide ellipse. The easiest method for drawing a large ellipse uses two lengths of scrap wood, like pieces of furring strips, three nails and a pencil.</p>

        <p>ONE way to transform an ordinary rectangular doorway into a dramatic entryway is by adding an arch. Creating an arch entails building a wooden frame, attaching it to the header and jambs, then covering it with drywall. Be aware that the arch will lower the top of the entryway by an inch or two.</p>
        <p>Start by drawing the curve of the arch on a wide sheet of three-quarter-inch thick plywood. Most entry arches usually curve in the shape of a wide ellipse. The easiest method for drawing a large ellipse uses two lengths of scrap wood, like pieces of furring strips, three nails and a pencil.</p>
        <p>Measure the entryway opening, and draw a line across the plywood long enough to match this opening dimension. Drive two small nails into the board, one at each end of the line. Find the midpoint of the line, then draw another line, perpendicular to the first line, at that point. The second line will determine how deep the arch will be. A short vertical line will produce a shallow arch, while a longer line will turn the curve into a semicircle. Drive the third nail into the end point of this line.</p>
        <p>Place the first piece of wood against the top nail so it is parallel to the base line. Place the second piece so it rests against both the top and end nails and overlaps the other board. Tack the boards together where they overlap, and position a pencil in the junction. To draw the ellipse, push the joined boards along the nails while holding the pencil in place (see illustration). As the joined boards slide around the nails, the pencil will draw a curve.</p>
        <p>Use a saber saw to cut the arc from the plywood and smooth any irregularities in the curve with a half-round file. Use this piece as a pattern to trace the curve on another sheet of plywood. Then cut the curve out of this sheet. The arch frame will consist of a sandwich, made up of the two pieces of plywood.</p>
        <p>These pieces of wood must be spaced apart so they are the same thickness as the header in the entryway wall. In order to gauge this thickness, you will have to remove the molding around the entryway and cut back the drywall enough to expose these framing members. Use short lengths of two-by-fours to make spacer blocks, and insert them between the plywood forms.</p>
        <p>There is no standard method for constructing the arch frame, but it must be sturdy, firmly attached to the header and side jambs, and provide sufficient nailing surfaces to attach the drywall. Consult the accompanying illustration to get an idea of the fabrication technique.</p>
        <p>Once the form is in place you can attach the drywall to it. Start by fastening flat panels of half-inch thick drywall to cover the face of the arch and the exposed header. Use drywall nails or screws.</p>
        <p>Use quarter-inch thick drywall to cover the arch itself. It flexes easily and if the arch's curve is shallow enough, the drywall can be pressed into place without cracking. For deep curves, you will have to score the back of the drywall with a utility knife and a straight edge at one-inch intervals.</p>
        <p>Lift the scored piece into place and, starting at one end, gently push it against the arch. The drywall will snap at the score lines and bend to fit the contours of the form. Fasten it in place with either nails or screws at four-inch intervals. You will probably need a helper to hold the drywall in place as you secure it to the frame.</p>
        <p>Finishing the arch consists of adding corner bead to reinforce the edges of the arch, then applying joint compound to smooth the surfaces. The ideal type of bead to use is called flexible corner bead. It is made of plastic and it has weblike flanges that allow the bead to bend easily into almost any curve. Bend the bead around the arch and staple the flanges to the drywall.</p>
        <p>Flexible corner bead is not always  available. (One supplier is Stockton Wire Products, Department TFH, 1106 West Isabel Street, Burbank, Calif. 91506.) If you have to use metal corner bead instead, to bend it, you will have to cut the flanges at one-inch intervals with tin snips. Secure the metal corner bead with either nails or screws.</p>
        <p>When the corner beads are in place, level and smooth the surface with joint compound. Allow at least 24 hours for it to dry and harden. Apply a second coat, then sand the surface. Finally, prime it and paint it to match the surrounding walls.</p>
