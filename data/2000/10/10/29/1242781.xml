        <p>GROWING up in Lawrenceville, Jim Vincent danced with companies in Mercer and Burlington Counties, capping his early career with the role of the little prince in American Repertory Ballet's ''Nutcracker.'' Now, having danced in the Netherlands and led a corporate life at Disneyland Paris, this big prince, 42, is returning to his home state as newly appointed director of his own troupe, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago.</p>
        <p>Hubbard Street, an acutely American company, has never had a new director since it was founded by Lou Conte, a onetime dancer, in 1977 -- around the time Mr. Vincent joined Nederlands Dans Theater.  Last August Mr. Conte retired, handing the repatriating Mr. Vincent a full home-and-away performing schedule, which includes appearances in Newark this weekend and Princeton next week.</p>
        <p>''I've been a busy guy since I got here,'' Mr. Vincent said, restating the obvious on the phone between rehearsals. ''Being in Europe for 22 years, my parents had given up on having me back.'' Luckily, they kept the beach house in Point Pleasant, where they can entertain Mr. Vincent, his wife, France Nguyen, and their three daughters.</p>
        <p>The 20-member Hubbard Street company is known for its energetic jumble of jazz, pop, humor and rolling good times. One can enjoy the music, the choreography and the dancers as they wrestle and caress, making precise connections, and risking not making them. In ''That's Life,'' for instance, a woman flings herself into the air toward a man who slips on his jacket before catching her.  Surely he must miss once in a while, but Mr. Vincent was not about to discuss that, beyond noting that the object was to make it as risky as possible.</p>
        <p>One of his plans for Hubbard Street is to have more works created specifically for the company, augmenting those borrowed, reset or inherited from others -- Twyla Tharp among them. This season the troupe introduces ''Minus 16'' by Ohad Naharin, the director of Batsheva Dance Company.  It's a snazzy ensemble piece where black-suited dancers jump and twirl with a calculated abandon that recalls Astaire or Kelly.  ''The piece is another kind of risk,'' said Mr. Vincent. ''It misleads you from beginning to end. Ohad has a gift for untying knots and breaking down barriers -- anyone's a victim.'' (He would not elaborate on that, either, to protect surprise effects.)</p>
        <p>Trey MacIntyre's new ''Split,'' on the McCarter Theater program, is made from Art Blakey's percussion piece, ''Study of Split Skin.'' Describing it as retro, Mr. Vincent spoke of its jazz improvisation and popular dance mode as ''not too deep and not too light.'' It's probably a good pair with Harrison McEldowney's ''Group Therapy,'' which has familiar pop tunes, tap gestures, speaking, and heaven help us, smoking. ''I look for people who melt borders,'' Mr. Vincent said.</p>
        <p>In his view, what he brings to the company is the right chemistry: ''I give 300 percent -- I clean the studio, rehearse, market, do development and help with education and touring. I'm involved on all levels because I have business background and connections -- not just professional but personal as well.  I'd like to develop young American talent and take it to Europe.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he presents some works that originated in Europe, in particular with Jiri Kylian, director of Nederlands Dans, where Mr. Vincent danced and choreographed for 13 formative years. The juicy ''Petite Mort'' (little death, a French term for orgasm) is set to the popular Mozart concerto known as the ''Elvira Madigan,'' because it was used in that film. The dancers, who were taught the supple movements by Mr. Kylian's assistant Roslyn Anderson, are in sexy little flesh-toned garments that used to be called pink underwear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kylian also set six Mozart contradances for ''Sechs Tanze,'' using classical music to poke fun at classical movement, by way of bare-chested men in turbans and powder-haired women with flexed knees and feet. Nacho Duato's full-bodied, contemporary ''Jardi Tancat'' (enclosed garden) has a sung score of old Catalonian field songs. Both these European-inspired dances are to be at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.</p>
        <p>His dreams are as prolific as the roles he plunges into. ''I see this as going worldwide,'' he said. ''I see the company, in a perfect world, having two or three seasons in Chicago, plus two national tours and two international tours. I'd like to have six new repertory pieces each season. I need to focus on enriching and diversifying.'' At this rate, it's just a matter of time till he comes up with a hit dance to ''Born in the U.S.A.''</p>
