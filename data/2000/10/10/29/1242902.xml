        <p>ITS first-born was a problem child, but the Hyundai family's subsequent offspring have been better behaved and more presentable. It's a good thing, too, since the clan is getting so big.</p>
        <p>This fall, with the introduction of its first sport utility vehicle, the Santa Fe, Hyundai is taking another big step in its transformation from struggling immigrant to the mainstream of middle America.</p>
        <p>When Hyundai, of South Korea, entered the United States market in 1986, its sole offering was the not-so-excellent Excel. That subcompact sold briskly, because of its low price and the fact that many domestic and Japanese automakers had abandoned the entry-level market. But the Excel was undone by serious quality problems, and Hyundai sales plunged as fast as they had risen.</p>
        <p>Hyundai regrouped, adding larger, more sophisticated vehicles like the compact Elantra, the midsize Sonata and the jazzy Tiburon coupe. It bolstered its warranty, helping to allay lingering apprehension about its quality. It packed its models with a host of standard features and priced them slightly below the competition.</p>
        <p>The formula has worked. Sales soared 82 percent in 1999, to 164,190 cars. Sales jumped another 57 percent through September of this year, putting Hyundai on course to exceed 200,000. The company expects the Santa Fe to provide an additional 50,000 annual sales.</p>
        <p>While the car-based Santa Fe is a logical next step, it is late to the market and far from alone. Ford is now selling its high-volume Escape, and Mazda has a similar vehicle, the Tribute. Toyota is bringing out a second-generation RAV4 that is larger and more appealing. Subaru has freshened its Forester, and Pontiac is offering the distinctive Aztek.</p>
        <p>Among the more truckish small S.U.V.'s, Chevrolet is adding a V-6 to its Tracker. And there are contenders like the popular Nissan Xterra, the Suzuki Vitara and Grand Vitara and the Sportage from Kia, a South Korean automaker that Hyundai now controls.</p>
        <p>Still, the Santa Fe seems capable of carving out a niche, particularly if one considers projections that the market for small sport utilities, currently about 450,000 a year, will double by 2005. By now, Hyundai has a large base of customers, many of whom may be itching to trade up to an S.U.V. Further, Hyundai has given the Santa Fe a distinctive look that sets it apart from a rather boxy crowd. And with dimensions at the larger end of the group, the Santa Fe feels more substantial, and more practical, than competitors like the RAV4.</p>
        <p>Designed at Hyundai's California studio, which has turned out some flashy design studies, the Santa Fe looks sharp, with bulging front fenders and flowing lines. With 8.1 inches of ground clearance (7.4 inches with front-wheel drive), the Santa Fe sits tall, and it is crowned with a standard roof rack. The lower body is wrapped in plastic cladding, which is applied more tastefully than on some S.U.V.'s, including the overstyled Aztek.</p>
        <p>Most of the Santa Fe's dimensions are nearly identical to those of the Honda CR-V, the segment's best seller. But the Hyundai is wider by nearly 3 inches. A result is a rugged, aggressive stance and a roomy interior. In fact, the Santa Fe looks and feels rather imposing, compared with some small sport utilities.</p>
        <p>The interior is distinctive, too, though it is somewhat busy, with a variety of swoopy shapes and a surfeit of plastic pieces, some of them rather cheap-looking. Nevertheless, the interior is functional and the seats are comfortable. The rear seats fold nearly flat for added cargo space.</p>
        <p>The Santa Fe has the requisite cup holders -- two in front, three in the rear -- as well as abundant storage space. The rear seatbacks have pockets. An overhead cubby holds sunglasses. A drawer pulls out from beneath the passenger seat; there is a shallow, hidden tray under the cargo floor; and the center console has a two-part storage bin.</p>
        <p>The Santa Fe lacks side air bags, which are still rare in this segment, but it has other safety features that go beyond government requirements. Sensors shut off the passenger-side air bag when a small child is sitting there, or when the seat is empty. There are three-point safety belts for all five seating positions.</p>
        <p>The front seat belts have automatic pretensioners to cinch an occupant tightly during a crash. Options include traction control, which is especially worthwhile on front-drive-only models, and antilock brakes.</p>
        <p>All Santa Fes come with air-conditioning, cruise control, power windows and locks, 16-inch alloy wheels, privacy glass and an AM/FM stereo with a CD player.</p>
        <p>Hyundai has positioned the Santa Fe as two models, depending on whether you want front drive or all-wheel drive. The base GL is a front-drive model with a 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder engine rated at 149 horsepower, paired with a five-speed manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic.</p>
        <p>The midlevel GLS and top-of-the-line LX have a 2.7-liter V-6, which is also available on the GL. All-wheel drive comes only with the V-6. All V-6 models have an impressively smooth four-speed Shiftronic transmission that can be shifted manually without a clutch.</p>
        <p>While its V-6 cranks out 181 horsepower, more than many other engines in this class, the Santa Fe's acceleration was a bit disappointing. The culprit here may be the test vehicle's relatively hefty weight of 3,752 pounds. The Santa Fe's bulk also gives the vehicle a heavy feel, so it seems less nimble than, say, the Escape or RAV4.</p>
        <p>Although I did not drive the four-cylinder Santa Fe, I can imagine how sluggish it must feel. If I were shopping, I'd stick with the V-6.</p>
        <p>The Santa Fe rides on what Hyundai calls an ''extensively revised'' version of the platform for its midsize Sonata sedan, and it has a one-piece unit body like that car. Yet, while the suspension is tuned to deliver a carlike ride and handling on pavement, the Santa Fe feels more like a sport utility than like a car.</p>
        <p>The all-wheel-drive system usually operates in front-drive only. but if sensors detect wheel slippage, up to 40 percent of the power is shifted to the rear wheels. The system is fully automatic, with no buttons to push or levers to pull. The Santa Fe can handle moderately snowy or muddy roads and trails, but it lacks the low-range gearing that hard-core off-roading often requires.</p>
        <p>Given Hyundai's ignominious early efforts, and despite steady improvements in the quality of its cars, reliability is a legitimate concern. In general, my test car, which was a preproduction model (and thus not a good indicator of what will end up in showrooms), seemed to be put together well. The company provides some extra piece of mind with its 10-year, 100,000-mile drivetrain warranty -- along with Kia's, the longest in the industry. In addition, every Hyundai comes with a 5-year, 60,000-mile warranty covering the rest of the car.</p>
        <p>Given the long list of standard features, the Santa Fe is priced competitively. The four-cylinder, front-drive version starts at $16,934. The GL with a V-6 is $18,734. All-wheel-drive models start at $20,234. A fully equipped Santa Fe has a list price of around $23,000.</p>
        <p>But get this: some dealers are saying that demand has been so strong they are selling the Santa Fe above sticker price. If true, this would amount to a remarkable change of fortune for Hyundai -- but less incentive for shoppers to consider the brand.</p>
        <p>Like other recently introduced Hyundai models, the Santa Fe proved surprisingly competent. Aside from the test vehicle's ho-hum acceleration and a few cheap interior touches -- shiny plastic, thin carpeting -- it is a neat package. Who would have thought that on its first attempt to build an S.U.V., Hyundai would come up with a vehicle so substantial, roomy and attractive?</p>
