        <p>LOOKING for the perfect Christmas gift? How about a personal submarine for $20 million? Or a family of decorative robots, at $6,000 to $14,000 each? (Barko, the robot dog, barks and wags his tail; one has been sold.)</p>
        <p>Extravagant? Maybe. But the 188-foot-long submarine sleeps 11 and can remain submerged for more than 40 days.</p>
        <p>For Karen Katz, president of Neiman Marcus Direct, the upscale retailer's catalog arm that is responsible for the splashy Neiman Marcus Christmas Book, lavish gifts are the norm. ''As a Dallas native, I've grown up with these fantasy gifts,'' said Ms. Katz, who until June was executive vice president in charge of stores for Neiman Marcus, based in Dallas. ''Part of our mission is to be imaginative and unique.''</p>
        <p>The store's first fantasy gift, a Black Angus steer that could be delivered on the hoof ($1,925) or as steaks ($2,230), was offered in 1959.</p>
        <p>The next year, the catalog offered his-and-hers gifts, a pair of Beechcraft airplanes for a total of $176,000. That has been followed by matching Chinese junks for $11,500, and matching ermine bathrobes at $6,975. At least one of each offering was sold, the company said.</p>
        <p>This year, the catalog has been published in three separate books and is, of course, available online (www.neimanmarcus.com).</p>
        <p>The magazine design staff of 10 is already on the lookout for next year's big gifts; about 18 months of work goes into each year's catalog. Stanley Marcus, 95, the chairman emeritus, suggested the submarine, which has already generated a sales inquiry at U.S. Submarines in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The vessel would be custom-made for any buyer.</p>
        <p>So what is Ms. Katz's dream gift from this year's catalog? His-and-hers Rokkakus kites decorated in a traditional Japanese design for $2,000, flying lessons included.</p>
        <p>''When I saw the kites for the first time, I thought, this is what I want to be doing,'' she said.</p>
