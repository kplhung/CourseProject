        <p>FRENCH women may not start out with innate advantages over the rest of womankind, but they certainly work harder at being beautiful than most. They eat little, dress well and cultivate aloofness. They also spend a great deal of time and money on cosmetics, creams, algae, mud packs, massages, winter tans and the like. Indeed, in almost every Paris neighborhood, the beauty spa is now a fixture. For many French women, it is their house of dreams.</p>
        <p>But pause for a moment to think of the other women in these elegant parlors, those whose job it is to make clients of all shapes and ages look, as well as feel, more beautiful. They so do with soft hands, reassuring voices and a dazzling array of pharmaceutical and natural accouterments. They must also be good listeners: day in, day out, their clients tell their tales, share their worries, pour out their hearts -- and emerge happier for the experience.</p>

        <p>FRENCH women may not start out with innate advantages over the rest of womankind, but they certainly work harder at being beautiful than most. They eat little, dress well and cultivate aloofness. They also spend a great deal of time and money on cosmetics, creams, algae, mud packs, massages, winter tans and the like. Indeed, in almost every Paris neighborhood, the beauty spa is now a fixture. For many French women, it is their house of dreams.</p>
        <p>But pause for a moment to think of the other women in these elegant parlors, those whose job it is to make clients of all shapes and ages look, as well as feel, more beautiful. They so do with soft hands, reassuring voices and a dazzling array of pharmaceutical and natural accouterments. They must also be good listeners: day in, day out, their clients tell their tales, share their worries, pour out their hearts -- and emerge happier for the experience.</p>
        <p>In Tonie Marshall's delightful new film, ''Venus Beauty Institute,'' which opened on Friday, Angele, Marie and Samantha work long hours in just such a spa under the watchful eye of its owner, Nadine (Bulle Ogier). Yet as the movie illustrates, behind their patient smiles, the three beauticians too have inner lives: dreams, hopes and disappointments. Marie (Audrey Tautou) and Samantha (Mathilde Seigner) are too young to be deeply scarred, but not so Angele, now in her mid-40's. She has known love and has learned to fear it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marshall wrote the role of Angele for Nathalie Baye, a lovely gift to an actress friend whose career of 30 years and more than 50 films has had its ups and downs but is now definitely up. Ms. Baye helped ''Venus Beauty Institute'' win the 1999 Cesar, the French Oscar, for best film, and she herself won the best actress award for her role in Frederic Fonteyne's ''Affair of Love'' at last year's Venice Film Festival. Now 52, with three new films due for release here in the coming months, she is entering ''un certain age'' with her career going strong.</p>
        <p>As Angele, Ms. Baye conveys above all fragility, the fragility of someone who has been so hurt by love that she prefers the safety of quick sexual encounters with near strangers. It's not surprising that when a younger man, Antoine (Samuel Le Bihan), falls for her and begins avidly courting her, she resists. Her emotions tell her to let go, but her experience warns her against it. She can handle the calm, pink world of the spa, but beyond its glass front and its garish neon sign, she feels lost and lonely.</p>
        <p>''I am sure there are many Angeles out there,'' Ms. Baye said in an interview in her airy Left Bank apartment. ''When I was shooting the film and returning home in the evening, I kept thinking that Paris is full of Angeles; they are everywhere, in New York, in cities all over the world. Men, too. People who have been somehow broken, yet find the courage to keep going.''</p>
        <p>For Angele, the struggle is all the greater because of the blurred ideals of beauty and love that surround her at work. She hears Samantha's steamy tales of successive conquests. She watches Marie allowing herself to be seduced by an aviator three times her age played by the veteran French actor-director Robert Hossein. She helps clients preen themselves for romantic trysts or gala evenings. And all become mirrors of her own turmoil.</p>
        <p>''There was no other actress who I thought could be credible in this role,'' Ms. Marshall said in a telephone interview, ''the role of a 45-year-old woman working as a beautician, someone who is a bit tired yet still has the air of, not a girl, but of an overgrown girl. When you write a part for someone, you're stealing their body, but also some of their soul. I was able to do that a bit. Nathalie has a way of being both withdrawn and very strong.''</p>
        <p>These are also traits that have enabled Ms. Baye to manage a long career that was launched when Francois Truffaut cast her in three films in the 1970's (''Day For Night,'' ''The Man Who Loved Women'' and ''The Green Room''). She has worked with directors like Jean-Luc Godard (''Every Man for Himself''), Bertrand Tavernier (''A Week's Vacation''), Daniel Vigne (''The Return of Martin Guerre''), Bertrand Blier (''The Stepfather''), Bob Swaim (''La Balance'') and Roger Spottiswode (''And the Band Played On''). Along the way she has picked up three Cesars, two for best supporting actress and one for best actress.</p>
        <p>Yet, for all that, Ms. Baye has never been considered -- and, in fairness, has never sought to become -- a ''star'' like, say, Catherine Deneuve or Isabelle Adjani.</p>
        <p>''It's a real job to be a star,'' she said. ''You have to work at it. I have never worked at it. It doesn't interest me. Some roles create more of a star than others, but it's also a way of living, an attitude. Sharon Stone has the attitude of a star, Susan Sarandon less so. Stars have a more glamorous, more inaccessible side to them. I'm not like that. I'm more ordinary. I was never very beautiful. I think I was chosen by Truffaut and Godard because I interested them as an actress. In 'Day For Night,' I was positively ugly.''</p>
        <p>ON the other hand, had Ms. Baye ever dreamed of stardom, she was well and truly disillusioned when her four-year marriage to the perennially popular French rock star Johnny Hallyday threw her into the world of paparazzi, tabloids and gossip columns.</p>
        <p>''I was already a known actress, but Johnny was among the best known stars in all of France, along with Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo, and I simply wasn't prepared for this,'' she recalled softly. ''It was extremely painful and extremely humiliating. I'd give an interview and talk for 45 minutes about a new film, then answer one question briefly about my private life. When the article came out, there'd be two columns about my private life and three lines on the film. I almost forgot I was an actress.''</p>
        <p>After she and Mr. Hallyday separated in the mid-1980's, she could at last turn her back on the tabloids and focus again on her career, working in theater as well as film. She also became even more careful in picking her roles.</p>
        <p>''I'd worry if I didn't have roles that seduced me, that pleased me, that made me travel, that took me somewhere,'' she said. ''If it's just a question of working for working's sake, I'd stop. The most difficult thing in this business is to keep alive desire. If there's no desire, you just can't do it.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, as Angele, her desire to act was well and truly awakened: she spent weeks visiting beauty parlors learning how to give a proper massage. The role also took her into a world she knew but that she had never really considered.</p>
        <p>''What the film shows is not at all invented; it's what happens in beauty parlors,'' she said. ''When I have my hair done, I'm truly astonished by the number of women who recount the most intimate details of their lives, shouting over the hair dryer so everyone can hear them. They are like confessions. People need to talk, to share their secrets, to break their solitude.''</p>
        <p>Now, however, when Ms. Baye goes to a beauty spa, she makes a point of not conversing.</p>
        <p>''I always say I slept badly last night and need some sleep,'' she said with a laugh.</p>
