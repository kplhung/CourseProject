        <p>THE truth about a school is not necessarily found in test scores, budgets or championship trophies. To get a sense of how teachers, administrators and students really feel about one another, check the bathrooms.</p>
        <p>Here at Lincoln High School last year they were filthy -- clogged with cigarette butts, smoke and loitering students. This year, they are immaculate and airy. That continues into the hallways, which are also shiny-clean and silent during class time, and through classrooms full of students with their heads burrowed in textbooks at 7:25 a.m.</p>
        <p>In other words, Lincoln has been transformed in just a few months.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Lincoln was labeled one of the state's worst performing schools. Its teachers came to work prepared for battle and students habitually congregated in hallways and stairwells -- anywhere but in class.</p>
        <p>Though Lincoln remains on New York's list of Schools Under Registration Review -- meaning that it still could be closed if things do not continue to improve -- so much has changed that word has filtered up to Albany where officials say they are hearing new, ''positive things'' about the school.</p>
        <p>The catch is that Albany responds mainly to test scores, and while Lincoln's soared last year, particularly in English, the principal who oversaw that improvement, Horace Williams, is gone -- after only nine months at the helm.</p>
        <p>This has thrilled teachers who chafed under his authoritarian approach and that of his boss, then-Superintendent Andre J. Hornsby; Both men, imports from Houston, had forced them to ''teach to the tests,'' teachers said.</p>
        <p>With the two gone, educators are celebrating a ''1,000 percent improvement'' in the atmosphere at Lincoln this year and throughout the district. The question is, will Yonkers be able to hang on to last year's academic gains without the whip-crackers at the top?</p>
        <p>Students have additional concerns. While they had mixed feelings about Mr. Williams and his team of new assistants -- nearly all of whom have also been swept from the school -- they are grappling with the third crew of administrators to run Lincoln in three years.</p>
        <p>They have seen dress codes enforced and ignored, discipline rules written and rewritten, bus passes for public transportation granted and taken away and given back again. Considering this, Maritza Lugar, 16, a senior, could hardly be blamed for taking a jaundiced view when she got a letter from Ivan Toper this summer, introducing himself as Lincoln's latest leader.</p>
        <p>''I was like, what if this guy's exactly the same?'' she said. ''There were so many changes last year and so much hostility toward the students. Everyone tried to do everything by intimidation.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a hallmark of Mr. Williams's brief tenure was extreme, public discipline, like the day he suspended more than 100 students for poor performance. That, apparently, had worked for him in Texas, but in Yonkers teachers complained that there was little follow-through, and that for all his tough talk, Mr. Williams's approach was little more than window dressing. Either way, it left students like Maritza troubled and confused.</p>
        <p>Manuel Guerreo, 16, came to school in September with similar misgivings. Last year's strong-arm approach had done little to make him or his friends more interested in learning, and he had no better hopes for the new team.</p>
        <p>''I figured it would be the same way this year and I didn't care,'' he said. ''I was like, just let me go to school and get it over with.''</p>
        <p>Yet both Maritza and Manuel say their feelings have changed 180 degrees, and they credit Mr. Toper with making the difference.</p>
        <p>A plain-speaking, former middle school principal, Mr. Toper appears to thrive on doing four things at once.</p>
        <p>Sitting behind an overflowing desk, he straightens out one student's bus pass problem with a phone in his left hand, fixes another's schedule with a pen in his right and discusses the cleanliness of the hallways with a janitor who has just stopped by. Then he leaps up as periods change to rush into the hallways and make sure he is seen ushering pupils to class.</p>
        <p>Where their former principal favored an aloof, militaristic style of leadership, Mr. Toper presents himself as a father figure, a tough but sympathetic type -- like a coach.</p>
        <p>For all the talk last spring about Yonkers's precarious school finances, the recent history of Lincoln High School suggests that what matters most here is neither money (the district made do with $17.8 million less than Dr. Hornsby had requested), nor muscle, nor fancy programming but people skills.</p>
        <p>''It's not that an outsider can't come in and do good things,'' said Mr. Toper, who has spent his entire 31-year career in the district. ''But there is a uniqueness to Yonkers that cries out for people who know the special needs here. It transcends race or sex or class. It's like this: My life's blood is in Yonkers.''</p>
        <p>That has not escaped Lincoln's teachers, many of whom are also veteran educators.</p>
        <p>They say they appreciate a principal who is already talking about what he wants to do next year, since Mr. Williams would never commit to a future at Lincoln -- in fact, he never even removed his Texas license plates. And despite the impressive academic gains students made last year, no one seemed very happy; the feeling in teachers' offices was apprehension mixed with resentment.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is the memory of last year's trials that has cast such a flattering light on Mr. Toper -- ''a honeymoon period,'' he calls it. Either way, he is taking full advantage.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Williams began school by telling students that the community considered them ''animals,'' Mr. Toper's administration welcomed everyone back from summer vacation with large banners proclaiming, ''We Have the Best Students,'' ''We Have the Best Staff,'' ''We Have the Best Parents.''</p>
        <p>''We're saying, 'You guys are good,' '' Mr. Toper said. ''People don't know how good you are. And you're smart. We're going to help you get smarter. That's a very different message.''</p>
        <p>There are still tough students and rough moments at Lincoln and Mr. Toper is no pushover. He singled out 100 students as potential troublemakers before school even began and sent letters home advising them to consider seriously whether they wanted to be at Lincoln. If so, they would have to sign a contract with the school promising to adhere to the rules.</p>
        <p>Some of those students -- 19 years old with only two high school credits in their files -- never showed up. Of the 86 who signed, 64 are doing well, Mr. Toper said. The rest have fared so poorly he may recommend that they leave school, too.</p>
        <p>In addition, every student in the school received a class schedule at home over the summer so that each would know exactly where to go on the first day back, instead of milling around the auditorium waiting for directions.</p>
        <p>''I was saying: 'We're ready Day 1. We're teaching. You're learning. We're here.' That's it,'' Mr. Toper explained.</p>
        <p>He also instructed teachers to spend the first two days of school on hard-core academics -- no toe-in-the-water easing in, as in past years. ''No one's going to have four or five days to get their paper, pencils or books together,'' he said. ''On Day 1, you're good to go.''</p>
        <p>With that kind of firm hand consistently in place, this year is the first that Angela Arias, a foreign language teacher, finally feels safe in the building.</p>
        <p>''The focus is off discipline for the teachers -- someone else is finally taking care of that,'' she said. ''I can literally close my door and conduct my whole lesson. This has never happened in my five years here.''</p>
        <p>Lauren Trager, the coordinator of Lincoln's Academy of Finance, who has been at the school since the 1970's, said: ''This year I feel much more connected to the school and everyone in it. Mr. Toper has taken control of the hallways and he's allowed us to take control of the classrooms. The best thing is, there's learning going on.''</p>
        <p>Parents, too, have noticed the changes.</p>
        <p>''My God, you wouldn't believe the difference,'' said Mary Ellen Winnicki, president of the Yonkers P.T.A. Council, whose daughter graduated from Lincoln last year. ''You walk in the building and you get this very happy, positive feeling -- from the kids, the teachers -- the whole place just shines. It's like everybody's been starved for oxygen and is now breathing fresh air.''</p>
        <p>Things at Lincoln are turning around so quickly that Mr. Toper plans to ask state officials to remove his school from the S.U.R.R. list this year. Apparently, Albany is already aware of the change.</p>
        <p>Michael Washousky, the supervisor in the State Office of Regional School and Community Services, said: ''From all reports that we have, the school is improving. I think the test scores bear that out.''</p>
        <p>Of course, Lincoln will have to hold onto its gains, and scores, especially in math, will have to continue to climb in order for the school to get off the list. If that happens by the end of this school year, Lincoln would be on the fast track.</p>
        <p>City schools typically remain on the list for about three years, though some have remained on it for eight, said Ira Schwartz, an education coordinator in the state office that oversees the program. ''A good number of schools do make appreciable improvements right off the bat,'' he said. ''They just kind of need that wake-up call and they're off the list by year two or three of the process.''</p>
        <p>Yonkers school board members are even more excited by the turnaround at Lincoln.</p>
        <p>''I've heard such positive things from teachers, from students and from parents -- like kids are going to class. They want to go to class,'' said Robert Ferrito, president of the board.</p>
        <p>''The whole atmosphere of the school has changed. One person can really make a lot of difference. It's a management style. You can be the smartest guy in the world, but if you can't build bridges and get people to see things your way, nothing will work. Now people are willing to go that extra mile again. They feel good about the school again.''</p>
        <p>The changes at the high school mirror those taking place at the district level, where Yonkers is trying to evolve from a famously struggling school system to a statewide example of what local control can do for inner city schools -- the operative word being local.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby, the former superintendent from Texas who was often called ''brilliant,'' even by his foes, was just as often criticized for being rigid, autocratic and out of touch with the sensitivities of this city (not to mention its strong teachers union), which has been mired for more than a decade in a battle over how to close the gaps in achievement between white and minority students.</p>
        <p>After the school board fired Mr. Hornsby last June, despite the fact that he had raised test scores, they brought in Joe L. Farmer, a man who -- like Mr. Toper -- has spent decades in the district.</p>
        <p>He immediately began describing himself as a consensus builder, someone whose most important challenge was to calm the turbulent schools and foster a tone of collaboration. To that end, one of his first moves was reconfiguring the phone system to make his office easier to reach.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby often touted his personal vision for a high-scoring Yonkers school district. In contrast, Mr. Farmer, who last worked for Mayor John D. Spencer coordinating efforts to desegregate public housing, speaks of the mayor often, and how important he is to the schools. (The mayor's brutal personality clashes with Dr. Hornsby ultimately left the school board little choice but to fire the superintendent.) Instead of describing the latest trends in education, Mr. Farmer waxes poetic about convincing every school cook, parent, truck driver and teacher that they are part of the same team.</p>
        <p>''We've looked at our problems collectively and made an attempt to solve them collectively,'' he says over and over.</p>
        <p>Back at Lincoln, Mr. Toper is blunter, but his aim is similar: improve the atmosphere and you can improve the entire system. Still, the new principal is quick to acknowledge that major strides took place last year, things ''any principal would be proud of,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Results on English Regents exams rose to more than 70 percent passing, and almost 40 percent of students passed the math test -- which leaves much room for improvement but was itself a 100 percent increase over the year before. Lincoln's Class of 2000 also won more scholarship money for college than any in the school's history.</p>
        <p>''I hope I do as well,'' Mr. Toper said. ''My style is different, that's the only thing. The substance of what we're trying to do is the same.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the new principal's style could not be more different from his predecessor's.</p>
        <p>He is a stocky, no-nonsense administrator, his shirt collar often undone at the top with his tie knotted slightly askew, while Mr. Williams was a natty dresser who prided himself on never raising his voice. Mr. Williams's office was large and neat. Mr. Toper's is small, and messy. (The rooms have been switched; Mr. Williams's former office is now reserved for conferences.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams had a Japanese rock-and-water sculpture dribbling peacefully behind his desk. Mr. Toper has fliers for oldies concerts tacked to one wall and an American flag hanging from another. Papers and books are piled everywhere, and an enormous chart showing where each teacher is at every moment dominates the room.</p>
        <p>Opposite that, a visitor might glimpse the more private Mr. Toper. He has decorated a wall with advertisements showing Gandhi, Einstein, Miles Davis and Caesar Chavez.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if anybody ever really gets that deep in here,'' the principal said. ''But it was very carefully thought out. Einstein and Miles Davis are centered. It's meant to subconsciously motivate people, to say that left brain or right brain, young or old, black or white, you have a chance to succeed.''</p>
        <p>Whether they catch that or not, no one will miss the slogan uniting all four pictures: ''Think Different.''</p>
