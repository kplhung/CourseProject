        <p>Don't count on your Merrill Lynch broker to get you into the opening ceremonies at the next Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>When the torch is lighted in Salt Lake City in 2002, Merrill will not be a sponsor of the United States teams. For the first time in 20 years, Merrill passed on renewing as the official brokerage firm, setting off a search for another company willing to pay about $20 million to be a sponsor through the next Summer Games, in 2004 in Athens.</p>
        <p>Finding a replacement is complicated by the consolidation of financial industries. Some brokerage firms now share a corporate parent with a bank, credit-card issuer or insurance company, each of which is a separate sponsorship category. John Hancock Financial Services and Visa International are global Olympic sponsors, while Bank of America is the official bank of the 2002 event.</p>
        <p>Olympic officials have set their sights on Merrill's rival, Charles Schwab, but Schwab seems satisfied to be sponsoring just the United States Ski Team.</p>
