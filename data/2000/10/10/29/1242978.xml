        <p>''Not everything should be for sale,'' Mayor Wellington E. Webb said this week -- raising more than a few eyebrows, because what he does not want to sell could mean as much as $89 million for Denver and the surrounding five counties.</p>
        <p>What he does not want to sell is the right to name the $400 million football stadium under construction beside Mile High Stadium, the rickety home of the city's beloved Denver Broncos since 1962.</p>
        <p>The new stadium is scheduled to open next summer, in time for the start of the 2001 season. Mile High will be leveled and the land will be turned into a parking lot.</p>
        <p>Ever since voters approved a small sales tax two years ago to finance the new stadium, the question of what to call it has roiled the community. Other cities in the same situation have solicited bids from corporate interests, an exercise that generated millions of dollars for the operating authorities and produced such evocative names as FedEx Field outside Washington, PSINet Stadium in Baltimore, Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Fla., and the Core States Arena in Philadelphia, which became First Union Center after one bank acquired the other.</p>
        <p>For some of those cities, the naming rights meant hundreds of millions of dollars over the length of the contract.</p>
        <p>Here, the solicitation proceeded in much the same way. A nine-member panel of government representatives, the Metropolitan Football Stadium District, was appointed to handle marketing issues and identify potential sponsors. Local newspapers have reported that several companies have expressed an interest, including AT&amp;T Broadband, Janus Capital Corporation and Invesco Funds Group.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the panel declined to comment on negotiations, other than to say the published lists were inaccurate. But to Mr. Webb, it hardly matters who the bidding companies are or even if the money would be used to pay off the construction bonds early, saving the taxpayers money.</p>
        <p>''My position is that everything in life is too unsettled,'' he said. ''Utility companies want to deregulate. With phone companies, you don't know who's handling your calls -- AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint, whoever. Banks change names so fast, the names on your checks don't correspond to who owns the bank. So for me, why would you sell an identifiable icon, even for millions of dollars? We're a Western city, a new city that doesn't have many icons. Once they're gone, they're gone.''</p>
        <p>Old Mile High may be a tin-can structure, a gangly maze of seats and beams that has no discernible style or panache, never mind luxury suites. But what it does have, in its name, is a deep connection to a city that sits 5,280 feet above sea level and projects an unmistakable image based on its proximity to the Rocky Mountains. Officials in the Colorado ski industry say that when it happens to be snowing on a day a Broncos game is televised nationally, the ski resorts are bombarded with telephone callers seeking reservations.</p>
        <p>With the bidding process under way, Mr. Webb said he had received countless calls, letters and e-mail messages expressing hope that the new stadium keep the name Mile High. A poll commissioned by a new grass-roots group, Friends of Mile High, found that nearly 70 percent of the respondents preferred the old name to a commercialized alternative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Webb's ardent support for retaining the old name has struck some critics as irresponsible, inasmuch as taxpayers are bearing 75 percent of the construction costs through a 10-year sales tax of one cent per $10. The Broncos are paying the other 25 percent. Several local officials say they favor selling the naming rights to pay down the debt and have urged Mr. Webb to allow the district panel to do its job without trying to influence public opinion.</p>
        <p>But that is precisely why Mr. Webb, who is a Democrat, and other Mile High supporters say they have been speaking out. They want to make sure the panel fulfills each of the two requirements of the bonding legislation: that bids are sought for naming rights, and that public sentiment is taken into account.</p>
        <p>John Hickenlooper, a Denver businessman who has helped lead the fight to retain the Mile High name, said he feared that the Broncos' ownership, which favors selling naming rights, had too much influence in the solicitation process because of a $15 million no-interest loan by the team early in the process to cover construction costs. If naming rights are sold, the loan would be paid back right away from the proceeds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hickenlooper called the arrangement ''a conflict of interests that verges on corruption,'' an accusation the team disputes.</p>
        <p>''We are a private company that is ultimately receiving the largest share of financial gain,'' said Joe Ellis, vice president of business operations for the Broncos, explaining the team's position. ''If any additional money could be brought in to ease taxpayer burdens, the Broncos feel it our responsibility to support that kind of effort.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Webb says he is unconvinced that dropping Mile High is the right way to go.</p>
        <p>''In New York, I can't imagine they'd change the name Yankee Stadium,'' he said. ''So why should we change our name here? And I think most people agree with me.''</p>
