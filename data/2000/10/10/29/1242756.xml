        <p>THE Ludlow Park neighborhood made perfect sense to Jane Campbell and Peter Whitely from the minute they stumbled on it three years ago.</p>
        <p>''Ludlow Park befits interstitial types of people, people who are neither fish nor fowl -- we're not Bohemians, but we're not corporate types,'' said Ms. Campbell, an actress, who in 1997 rented an 1891 Victorian house with an option to buy. ''It needs a ton of work. But once we got accustomed to its grand sweeping spaces, huge ceilings and very large rooms, it became hard to downsize to move to a better neighborhood. Ultimately, living here became a perfect fit for our family. We have our two children at an excellent private school, and we found ourselves exactly in the kind of house we wanted to live in at an affordable price.''</p>

        <p>THE Ludlow Park neighborhood made perfect sense to Jane Campbell and Peter Whitely from the minute they stumbled on it three years ago.</p>
        <p>''Ludlow Park befits interstitial types of people, people who are neither fish nor fowl -- we're not Bohemians, but we're not corporate types,'' said Ms. Campbell, an actress, who in 1997 rented an 1891 Victorian house with an option to buy. ''It needs a ton of work. But once we got accustomed to its grand sweeping spaces, huge ceilings and very large rooms, it became hard to downsize to move to a better neighborhood. Ultimately, living here became a perfect fit for our family. We have our two children at an excellent private school, and we found ourselves exactly in the kind of house we wanted to live in at an affordable price.''</p>
        <p>Last year the couple bought their Queen Anne Victorian on Belvedere Drive for less than $400,000, and Ms. Campbell said, ''We're looking forward to more people with young children moving to the neighborhood so that our children can have more friends and more backyard kinds of experiences.''</p>
        <p>But realtors said that despite the fact the tree-lined streets of Ludlow Park are replete with backyards, it can sometimes be a challenge to unite buyers with sellers. Some of the approximately 220 turn-of-the-century Victorian, colonial, Tudor and Gothic homes in the neighborhood are passed down as family heirlooms. Then, potential buyers for any of the remaining inventory must decide if they are interested in this small, racially and socioeconomically heterogeneous neighborhood, where according to the Yonkers Planning Bureau, 17 percent of the residents live below the poverty level.</p>
        <p>''Not many customers call looking for homes in the southwest area of Yonkers because of the surrounding distressed areas,'' said Laurene A. Perillo, a saleswoman at Century 21 Wolff in Yonkers.  ''People have a way of looking at the worst and miss out on the beautiful homes this area has to offer.''</p>
        <p>But Denise Gang, a saleswoman at Prudential Ragette Realtors in Bronxville, contends that ''1998 was the turning point for the Ludlow Park market, and 1999 was an even better year.'' She continued: ''In the year 2000, buyers are finding less inventory, so when a house comes on the market, it sells quite quickly for close to the asking price. If a buyer is looking for a stately home with charm and an affordable price tag, Ludlow Park is the place.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Devorah Thau and her husband, Brian, a rabbi who teaches at the North Shore Hebrew Academy in Great Neck, N.Y., bought a high ranch in Ludlow Park. They had been renting in North Riverdale in the Bronx and had hoped to purchase  there. But Mrs. Thau said: ''The prices in Riverdale were kind of outrageous, especially for what you get. The size of my home and my backyard is not only so much bigger than it would have been in Riverdale, it also cost significantly less.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gang said there were many affordable homes in Ludlow Park. Small 1,600-square-foot three-bedroom, one-bath ranches can be bought for as low as $180,000. For about $240,000 to $325,000, buyers can find 2,500-square-foot colonials and some Victorians in need of repair on up to half an acre of land. Gracious 3,800-square-foot homes with Hudson River views and traces of a bygone era, including stained glass windows, pillars and sleeping porches, are in the $400,000 to $450,000 range.</p>
        <p>LUDLOW PARK also has co-ops and rental apartments, said Lee J. Ellman, planning director for the city of Yonkers. The 331 co-op units are in six complexes. A two-bedroom unit ranges from $55,000 to $75,000, Mrs. Gang said. In addition, there are 83 two-and three-family homes with 465 apartment units. A two-bedroom apartment rents for about $750 to $850 a month.</p>
        <p>The diversity of the housing stock in Ludlow Park is mirrored by the Yonkers school system, which prides itself on offering students many different educational options.</p>
        <p>Joseph Farmer is interim superintendent of the 26,600-student system, whose students represent more than 40 different cultures.  ''Here in Yonkers, choice is our benchmark,'' he said. ''We try to prepare youngsters for work, as well as college. We have a large number of programs that attempt to meet the needs of every youngster.''</p>
        <p>There are 42 public schools in the city, 10 of which are magnet schools. They include the Museum Elementary School, where children work closely with the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers; Gorton High School, where students focus on law and technology; and Saunders Trades and Technical High School, which was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the United States Department of Education in 1998.</p>
        <p>The district's newest magnet school is the Yonkers Middle High School, which is establishing an International Baccalaureate program for grades 6 through 12. Its curriculum is based on a program of international standards that, Mr. Farmer said, ''is over and above New York standards.''</p>
        <p>Though the district has been growing by 600 to 800 youngsters a year, he said, class sizes have remained small because of new school construction. In addition, Mr. Farmer said, ''No child ever gets lost here because we provide targeted instruction in the form of after-school learning, before-school learning opportunities and Saturday instruction.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I don't think parents have to send their kids out of the district for a strong education. It's a question of their finding out what we have here.''</p>
        <p>Cicely Greaves-Vega, PTA president of Lincoln High School, agrees.''The resources are there,'' she said. ''There are plenty of opportunities. There are lots of different programs to target children who have all different difficulties and strengths.''</p>
        <p>Melinda Billig, a social work supervisor for New York City Public Schools whose three children attend Yonkers schools, said: ''It's all there for the taking. You just have to find out about the opportunities, and you have to have a motivated kid who wants to learn.'' This summer her daughter, Eliora Noetzel, participated in a program for talented youths at Stanford University with ''gifted children from the best school districts in the country.'' She said: ''There is good and bad everywhere. You can be in a small school system and have an awful teacher and your child can have a bad year. Smaller is not always better because when you're in a large school system like this, there are always choices.''</p>
        <p>Last year, 915 high school seniors graduated in a class of 1,045 students. Public school students averaged 424 in College Board verbal tests and 430 in math, compared with statewide averages of 495 in verbal and 502 in math. Among the graduating seniors, 437 went on to four-year colleges. Another 234 students went on to two-year colleges and 36 to business schools.</p>
        <p>Nineteen percent of the students who live in the district attend parochial and Jewish day schools in Yonkers and neighboring communities.</p>
        <p>John Spencer, mayor of Yonkers, said he looked forward to the day when the school system ends two decades of emotional turmoil that began in 1980, when a local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. brought a lawsuit accusing the city of intentionally segregating its schools. Since 1986, as a result of the suit, the school system has operated under federal supervision. Mr. Spencer said this long-running suit has troubled the city in recent years. ''We have had an image problem because of past chaos and instability,'' he said. ''But in all fairness, we have made incredible strides in the progress and quality of life here over the last four to five years.''</p>
        <p>THERE has recently been talk of settling the suit and in August, Gov. George E. Pataki pledged $10 million in state money toward that goal. Mr. Spencer said the fact that the schools may soon be freed from court supervision means ''Yonkers is really back and beyond.''</p>
        <p>Families have lots of recreational choices in Yonkers, where there are more than 65 parks occupying more than 400 acres of land, said Mitchell Tutoni, parks commissioner. Although there are no parks in Ludlow Park itself, the 6.2-acre Fay Park borders the neighborhood and includes two ball fields and tennis courts. The city also has an ice skating rink, an indoor swimming pool, a rifle range and four community centers. City residents can golf at two Weschester County-owned 18-hole courses: Dunwoodie  and Sprain Lake.</p>
        <p>Ludlow Park is home to Leake &amp; Watts Services Inc., which began as an orphanage in 1831 and is now an independent child-welfare agency. It occupies about 30 acres, about a third of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>One ongoing problem for the neighborhood has been the 30-acre Yonkers Joint Wastewater Treatment Plant along the Hudson River. Nortrud Wolff Spero, co-president of the Ludlow Park Homeowners Association and a realtor in Yonkers, said that over the years the sewage treatment plant has frequently given off bad odors, and ''we've gone to State Supreme Court over it.'' Commissioner Anthony Landi of the Westchester County Department of Environmental Facilities, said: ''Yes, there definitely had been a problem. But it is much less of one. In 1995 there were 236 odor complaints from residents in the neighborhood of the plant. So far this year, there have been 39 complaints.'' He expects further improvement that he hopes will eventually eliminate the odors.</p>
        <p>Yonkers, Westchester County's largest municipality in population, was once part of the manor of Frederick Philipse, a Dutch carpenter who migrated to the colonies in 1653 and eventually amassed 52,000 acres. The land was ultimately confiscated from his grandson, a loyalist, during the Revolutionary War; it was sold off and local farmers prospered. When the New York Central Railroad arrived in 1849, wealthy businessmen built summer homes there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellman of the city planning department said: ''In the mid-1960's this office carved the city into 38 neighborhoods. By doing so, we gave local flavor to otherwise flavorless census statistical areas. Ludlow Park was named for Thomas W. Ludlow, who built an Early Gothic Revival-style home there, Cottage Lawn.'' It was later occupied by four generations of Ludlows. On Aug. 10, 1933, the Yonkers Planning Commission approved subdividing the property into 21 lots. Cottage Lawn was razed, and several colonial and English-style homes have taken its place.</p>
