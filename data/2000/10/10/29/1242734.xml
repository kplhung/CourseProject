        <p>Steve Sabol  like many of his contemporaries in Haverford, outside Philadelphia, in the 1950's -- would rush home from school to turn on his favorite television show.</p>
        <p>''But no one would be coming over to my house, because they all wanted to watch 'American Bandstand,' '' said Mr. Sabol. ''Me, in fifth grade, I was watching 'Victory at Sea.' It had that great Richard Rodgers score, all that grand military stuff.''</p>
        <p>''It was either that,'' he remembered, ''or playing football.''</p>
        <p>So it was a fortuitous that Mr. Sabol's father, Ed, got a Bell &amp; Howell 16-millimeter movie camera for a present. Ed Sabol, an overcoat salesman, fiddled with the camera off and on and finally, in his 40's, decided to try to film professional football games. Then he showed Pete Rozelle, who was by then the commissioner of the National Football League, some films of his son's high school football games and -- salesman that he was -- got the filming rights to the 1962 N.F.L. championship game.</p>
        <p>''What a dream it was to be on the field of a pro football game and to be filming it,'' said Steve Sabol. ''I can still feel the excitement of that day, and I still feel almost that excited every week.''</p>
        <p>The Sabols' one-game experiment has grown over nearly four decades into one of the great movie studios in the country, N.F.L. Films. While Dreamworks or Warner puts out more blockbusters, N.F.L. Films -- with headquarters in a low-rise industrial park in this Philadelphia suburb -- is as innovative as any of them.</p>
        <p>Whether it is slow-motion shots in which beads of sweat float like space balls or the emphatic Victory-at-Sea-like music that accompanies crunching bodies or the series of reaction shots that tell more about a play than how many yards it gained, N.F.L. Films did it first. And most of the camera tricks were either thought up or refined by Steve Sabol, perhaps the most underrated filmmaker working today.</p>
        <p>''I like to think that my father and I were a perfect father-and-son team,'' says Mr. Sabol, who is seated in his first-floor office looking out on nothing more glamorous than his parking space. ''The problem with most family businesses is that both generations have the same set of skills. My father, he was the most important, because he knew business and loved schmoozing with people, while he let me try all these things with the films.''</p>
        <p>Ed Sabol now retired, spends most of his time in Arizona and visits Philadelphia every so often. His son, who is 58, runs things by himself. And the younger Mr. Sabol doesn't have to worry about the business end since the National Football Leage bought Blair Films (named after Steve's sister) in the mid-1960's, renamed it N.F.L. Films, and kept the Sabols running it.</p>
        <p>Peppered throughout the serpentine halls of N.F.L. Films are framed posters of old movies, particularly ones with a football theme, like ''Jim Thorpe, All-American,'' starring Burt Lancaster or even ''$1,000 a Touchdown,'' featuring Joe E. Brown and Martha Raye. There are also examples of Mr. Sabol's own artwork -- wooden boxes containing what can best be described as random art objects.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I was really lucky,'' he said. ''I had this father who was a great businessman and loved football and this mother who knew art and lived it.''</p>
        <p>His mother, Audrey Sabol, merely says she was in the right place at the right time when she started collecting art in the 1950's and 60's. She would do some sculpture and seek out events through the Arts Council of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''I would come home from school and there would be Jasper Johns over for dinner,'' said her son. ''We had Lichtensteins in the bathroom before anyone knew who he was. I just drank it all in. And then I went out and played football.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabol likes to talk about his approach to filming football games as a Cubistic look at sport. ''Picasso would look at a woman's face, say, and try to imagine it from multiple perspectives,'' he explained. ''So I might say, 'Let's take that down to 32 frames a second,' or 'Let's show it first from the top and then from the ground.' I'd think of great films and see how they were made and then relate that to football.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Sabol's favorite scenes is from ''A Man and a Woman,'' directed by Claude Lelouch, in which a a man and a woman are shown falling love without a word being spoken.</p>
        <p>''The camera goes around the table; the music plays just right,'' he said. ''If you can show something as complex as people falling in love, why couldn't I show the emotions of a football game with the right music, the right camera angles?''</p>
        <p>So the younger Mr. Sabol returned from Colorado College to do the camera work while his father handled the business end of the operation.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I remember our first football follies film,'' he said. ''It wouldn't have made it without my father. There was this league official in charge of this stuff named Bob Cochrane. He went to Harvard Business School and was a marine, and I think he was so stiff he wore an eight-piece suit.</p>
        <p>''Well, he saw our short clip and started yelling that this was humiliating to the players,'' Mr. Sabol recalled. ''I was petrified, but my dad said it would show the players as human beings. Remember, this was 1967, before Dick Clark and all the rest had bloopers shows, so we were taking a real chance. Rozelle was willing to take that chance, if players would go along.''</p>
        <p>The commissioner let the Sabols show the clip to the Philadelphia Eagles at training camp one night after a long workout.</p>
        <p>''These huge guys were roaring with laughter,'' he said. ''They were only upset we didn't have more. It became the biggest-selling sports film ever and spawned an entire bloopers industry.''</p>
        <p>And it solidified the Sabols' trust with players and team officials.</p>
        <p>While N.F.L. Films seems ubiquitous now -- with 250 employees processing 800 miles of film into 2,000 hours of original programming a year, Mr. Sabol says emphatically that it wasn't always thus.</p>
        <p>''Early on, we weren't even on TV,'' he said. ''My father took that first N.F.L. championship game film to Kiwanis Clubs, Boy Scouts. He'd have, say, Dale Shofner or Frank Gifford from the New York Giants come with him and show it. They d bring their own screen and projector.''</p>
        <p>By the late 1960's, their films were showing up on a syndicated television show called ''N.F.L. Films Presents.''</p>
        <p>''But if you wanted to watch it, good luck,'' Mr. Sabol recalled. ''It would show up at midnight or 2 a.m., and even then not regularly. We said our audience was hospital orderlies, milkmen and fathers with newborns. We were like Andy Warhol, underground cult favorites.''</p>
        <p>Then, Howard Cosell -- whose son became a producer at N.F.L. Films -- started giving the operation plaudits on Monday Night Football halftime highlights and, in 1978, the fledgling sports network ESPN regularly put on its clips. N.F.L. Films not only got discovered by the masses, it got complimented by the pros.</p>
        <p>''N.F.L. highlight reels had a real impact on how movies get made, particularly montages,'' said the director Ron Howard. ''Lots of different images. Images on images. Using the slow-motion, combined with the live action. The hard-hitting sound effects, juxtaposed against incredible music, powerful music, creating a really emotional experience for the viewer.''</p>
        <p>These days, N.F.L. Films is moving into the Internet age. Each film that comes in from a game is immediately digitized. Catalogers pore over every scene and make as many as 132 comments, from the players in the scene to any advertising sign that may appear and be useful later.</p>
        <p>In fact, the company will be moving into new offices here next year that will triple its space. Fiber-optic cables are being laid and satellite-dish farms are being readied for a bigger leap into the digital future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabol has the reputation of being a good boss and allowing innovation and entrepreneurship to flourish. More than a quarter of the employees at N.F.L. Films  have been with him more than 25 years. What's more, he gives a $1,000 bonus for great mistakes, because, he says, ''you wouldn't make that mistake unless you were trying hard to do something interesting.''</p>
        <p>Currently, NFLFilmstv.com does several shows a week unique to the Internet -- live Web casts with the commentators Ron Jaworski and Merril Hoge -- also available on replay. In addition, the Web site offers such choices as best plays or hits of the week and other features based on the television shows it produces, like ''N.F.L. Films Presents.''</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Sabol is a bit of a television star himself, doing interviews for the centerpiece features on ESPN's ''N.F.L. Films Presents.'' Many of them are evergreens, done during the company's down time from May to August. During the season, most weekends find Mr. Sabol at his house in Moorsetown, only six minutes from his office -- watching games by satellite, three televisions going at once.</p>
        <p>''What can I say?'' asked Mr. Sabol, his head framed behind his computer by dozens of pieces of football detritus from helmets to glasses to autographed mini-footballs. ''I have the greatest job in the world. To turn an obsession into a job, who can complain?''</p>
        <p>For someone who deals with violence and mayhem on a daily basis, his hobbies are serene by comparison. Mr. Sabol, a divorced father with a teenage son, lives with a girlfriend in a house crammed with artworks. He has his own studio, and spends much of his time gardening, another obsession. Ocassionally, he golfs. He doesn't play football.</p>
        <p>''I have no line of succession,'' he said with a grin. ''I will be taking care of this place every day when I'm 85, I assure you. ''I haven't gotten tired of it yet, so I can't see it ever happening. I fell into this, and I can't believe how lucky a life I've lived.''</p>
