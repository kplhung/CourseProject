        <p>With a series of rallies from Babylon to Plattsburgh, Representative Rick A. Lazio sought to stir his base of supporters today with fiery reminders of his New York roots and calls not to trust the government.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running against Mr. Lazio to become the junior United States senator from New York, also headed upstate, beginning a three-day bus tour that will take her from Buffalo to Albany, with Senator Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn at her side.</p>
        <p>Apart from a couple of morning events in his home district on Long Island, Mr. Lazio spent much of the day upstate, hitting Ballston Spa, Glens Falls, Plattsburgh and Lake Placid. Mr. Lazio has been campaigning heavily in the region to dull the unusually strong support there for Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>At the same time, aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who has played a fairly low-profile role in this campaign, said he was filming an advertisement on behalf of Mr. Lazio, his fellow Republican, who stepped in to run for the Senate after Mr. Giuliani dropped out of the race for health reasons. The ad will be aimed at Jewish voters, and will feature Mr. Giuliani praising Mr. Lazio as a strong supporter of Israel.</p>
        <p>With 10 days left before the election, both candidates have begun shifting their emphasis to generating a strong turnout and to chipping away at voting blocs that they believe offer their opponents soft or shaky support.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has been campaigning heavily in the suburbs, usually a strong base of support for Republicans; Mr. Lazio has held a number of events to appeal to women, in an effort to stop Mrs. Clinton from gaining more ground among female voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio sought today to arouse supporters with a speech tailored to tap into what his aides see as a well of mistrust that people feel toward  government and Mrs. Clinton.  Though a congressman for eight years, he gave an antigovernment message that drew whoops of applause and cheers.</p>
        <p>''New Yorkers can govern New York,'' Mr. Lazio said at a rally in Ballston Spa, north of Albany. ''We don't need anybody from the outside coming in here. We don't back down from a fight, we New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>Raising the issue of education, Mr. Lazio said, ''We don't need a de facto national school board out of Washington, D.C., telling us what kind of curriculum we should have, telling us how we should spend our own money, because we know that every school district is different.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The point is, let's trust our own communities. Let's give people control over their own lives.''</p>
        <p>Recent polls suggest that Mr. Lazio is leading upstate by a margin of about 10 percentage points, but political analysts say he needs a larger margin in the region to overcome the overwhelming support that Mrs. Clinton is expected to receive in New York City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio began his day on Long Island, appearing at a rally at West Babylon Junior High School with Gov. George E. Pataki and other elected officials. Held in the school gymnasium, the event took the form of a pep rally, with pop music blaring, balloons, pompoms and chants of ''Go, Rick, go!''</p>
        <p>The gym had been cut in half by a partition, and there were enough people to fill only about half of that. The size of the crowd was actually the same or a little smaller than in many of his upstate rallies, despite the presence of the governor and the fact that it was held in Mr. Lazio's Congressional district.</p>
        <p>Senator Schumer, who accompanied Mrs. Clinton yesterday, said he had suggested the idea of a campaign-ending trip through upstate New York to her, because it had proved successful for him when he defeated Alfonse M. D'Amato in the 1998 Senate race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer wore the same blue plaid shirt that was his standard in the 1998 campaign. ''I thought it would bring good luck,'' he said. The first lady wore a tangerine-colored fleece, intended to mark Halloween.</p>
        <p>In Elmira, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton visited a garden center, posing by an 850-pound pumpkin.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was also joined today on the campaign trail by Ben Affleck, the actor, who came up with another way to raise questions about Mr. Lazio's experience to be a senator. Mr. Affleck said Mrs. Clinton, who just turned 53, had been working to improve education back when Mr. Lazio, 42, was ''running around his frat house in his underwear.''</p>
