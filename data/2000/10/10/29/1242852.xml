        <p>Community boards are trickling into cyberspace. Last month, Board 7 in Manhattan unveiled a Web site for residents of the Upper West Side, and Board 5 in Midtown plans to launch its site this month.</p>
        <p>Seven boards are online. But the remaining 52 of the city's 59 community boards, still rely on fliers and word-of-mouth to notify the public about coming events.</p>
        <p>''For many people, the Web is the only link they have to their government,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, which released a study on the issue last year.  ''Most people don't have time to wait on line to testify or go to meetings.''</p>
        <p>But community boards may be getting a dot-com makeover. Neighborhood Link, an Internet startup based in Denver, began offering every community board free Web sites and training over the summer, in exchange for space on the sites for banner ads. Thirteen boards have accepted the offer, including half of the 18 boards in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''This is a great way to utilize the Internet to facilitate communication between real-world communities versus virtual ones, such as a community of cat lovers,'' said Ted Pinkowitz, founder of the company.</p>
        <p>The company has also joined with the Citizens Committee of New York City, a nonprofit group, to extend the free offer to some 12,000 block associations and advocacy groups citywide. At the same time, the city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications is exploring ways to include all 59 boards on the city's official site, nyc.gov.</p>
        <p>Still, not every board wants to go virtual.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how helpful it would be,'' said Kathy Dodd, district manager of Staten Island's Board 2. ''We already have a computer, America Online and an e-mail address.''</p>
