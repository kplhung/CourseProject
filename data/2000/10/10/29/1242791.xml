        <p>Mario A. Paparozzi, who served 25 years in the state Division of Parole, has been asked by Governor Whitman to return to state service as chairman of the beleagured New Jersey Parole Board.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paparozzi replaces Andrew B. Consovoy, who left as board chairman in June, citing health reasons.  Mr. Consovoy was under investigation by the state attorney general in connection with allegations of favorable treatment for several inmates with organized-crime ties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Consovoy was also under pressure to explain a huge backlog of parole hearing cases, which Dr. Paparozzi will move to clear out. State inmates filed a class-action suit against the board in May, claiming lack of action illegally denied inmates the right to fair hearings.</p>
        <p>The attorney general found ealier in the year that the board was operating with a backlog of roughly 4,000 cases, said Pete McDonough, the governor's director of communications, adding that the backlog has been reduced to roughly 1,200 cases.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paparozzi, who started as a parole officer and left state service in 1998 as head of the Divison of Parole, now teaches criminal justice classes at the College of New Jersey. A past president of the American Probation and Parole Association, Dr. Paparozzi is a board member of the Crime Victims' Legal Center.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paparozzi is an advocate of the ''broken windows'' theory of law enforcement, which holds that strict enforcement of minor offenses prevents criminals from committing greater offenses later.</p>
        <p>Nationwide, states have tightened their parole policies, making it much harder for inmates to be released early. According to the Bureau of Criminal Justice Statistics, 27 states have changed their parole systems in the last 15 years, and 14 have eliminated early parole. The federal prison system requires all inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. In the mid-1990's, the New Jersey Legislature also required that inmates convicted of serious crimes serve 85 percent of their sentences before they are eligible for release.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paparozzi, who once headed the Division of Parole's intensive intervention unit, said that clearing the parole-case backlog did not mean prisoners would be put back on the street.</p>
        <p>''My perspective has to do with justice for victims and public safety in the short and long term,'' he said. ''The reponsibility of the board is that everyone gets a hearing on time and the law is followed, but not everyone gets paroled.''</p>
