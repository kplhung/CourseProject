        <p>BACK at school after the third-grade trip to the Hayden Planetarium, every Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail among us sat with bended head neatly copying Miss Shoemaker's master letter from the blackboard: ''Dear Miss Birch, thank you for allowing our class to visit the star show.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Peter S., like his high-tempered namesake Peter Rabbit, cowered red-faced in the corner, desk expelled to the gulag, composing his private mea culpa: ''Dear Miss Birch, I apologize for writing on the wall of the Planetarium. . . .'' In Miss Shoemaker's Stalinist homeroom of a bygone generation, Peter's sin was a transgression comparable to one that would trigger metal detector alarms to scream at today's school entrances.</p>
        <p>Those were different times. And so was the squat, solid planetarium at the Museum of Natural History. You'd hardly recognize either.</p>
        <p>I'd been back to the planetarium since the third grade. Retracing Holden Caulfield's footsteps in obligatory high school ''Catcher in the Rye'' homage, I crossed into the planetarium out of nostalgia, but like any sarcastic adolescent, considered myself far too old for a star show.</p>
        <p>In my young New York City mother phase, anxious to encourage my precocious toddler, I'd wheeled her stroller into the womblike theater. Vivid are memories of me on hands and knees chasing the bottle of apple juice she dropped as it rolled fast as a rocket down the slanting aisles. Like the forces of gravity explained in the exhibits, that accelerating bottle demonstrated a graphic if unorthodox lesson of the laws of physics.</p>
        <p>Later I'd sat through Friday night laser rock star shows the Planetarium offered to boost attendance, surrounded by the sweet smell of Upper West Side grass floating like cirrus clouds above uptilted heads of a woozy audience.</p>
        <p>The planetarium was a Temple to Science -- popular science though it might be -- and through every visit I and the rest of the congregation soaked in the heavenly majesty it delivered. As I came blinking out into the bright light of Central Park West, rejoined pedestrian existence and fumbled for my token for the bus ride home, I felt my earthly scale magnified by recent brush with the Pleades, the meteors and the grainy rings of Saturn. Life seemed more meaningful somehow, fresh from virtual journey into a sunspot's molten heart.</p>
        <p>None of this prepared me for my inaugural visit to the new millennium planetarium now holding court within its conspicuous cage of glass.</p>
        <p>Although first view of that beautiful glistening cube made me gasp, the most unforgettable phenomenon I saw all afternoon had little to do with astronomy: two maintenance men holding rags and spray cans of Windex performing the Sisyphean task of cleaning its infinity of windows.</p>
        <p>Gone are hushed tones and churchlike silence. The New Age temple is high-tech and slick. Light and metal are the themes of Now. At every turn there are buttons to push, triggering flashing lights and sound bites. The bewildered visitor in the circular pathways, all senses assaulted, feels the universe grow more unfathomable by the minute.</p>
        <p>Purchasers of separate tickets to the Space Show are whisked upstairs clutching their passports to space.  Crammed body to body, they wait in the antechamber of the auditorium feeling numerous as the stars. A canned recording ushers them inside, repeating cautionary mantra with ad nauseam reassurance: ''Remember, each seat provides equal views of the Universe.''</p>
        <p>The show is a special-effects extravaganza, reminiscent of sci-fi flick and theme park rocket ride. Narration by Tom Hanks makes science feel even more remote. At the end, ushers standing rigidly in the heart of the Milky Way spring to life, herding the audience toward the exit. The crowd descends the circular ramp built as a metaphor for the history of the universe until with spinning heads they reach the terra firma of the present.</p>
        <p>Afterward I and other star-shocked parents and children crossed into the comforting silent familiarity of the Museum of Natural History. There we met old friends immobilized into immortality: the arctic wolf, the African elephant, the tiny birds frozen forever in their symbiotic ride upon bison's back.</p>
        <p>Maybe the fault lay with my jaundiced eye, having watched too many comets come and go, heard too many big bangs, shaded my eyes from too many eclipses. But after a visit to the sleekly packaged Rose Center for Earth and Space, promoted as the ''new architectural icon for New York City,'' return to Mother Earth was never a greater comfort. Aiming to be hands on, alas it put me off.</p>
        <p>If, like the taxidermy exhibits at the museum, Peter S. were somehow suspended in time as an eternal boy, I doubt whether even he would have the temerity to scribble on the walls of today's planetarium. Besides, it's not that easy to write on glass.</p>
