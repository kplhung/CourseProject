        <p>Millions of books recounting ''The Night Before Christmas'' may be up for revision. In a new book, ''Author Unknown'' (Henry Holt &amp; Company), Don Foster, a literary scholar known for establishing the authorship of an anonymous text by analyzing its style and vocabulary, argues that the wealthy Manhattan biblical scholar Clement Clarke Moore stole credit for writing the poem.</p>
        <p>It was originally published anonymously in 1823 as ''An Account of a Visit From St. Nicholas'' and helped to create the American image of Santa Claus as a jolly old elf. Moore stepped forward as its author in 1844. Mr. Foster argues that the poem bears the stylistic fingerprints of Henry Livingston Jr., a gentleman poet living in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., who died before the poem became famous or Moore took credit.</p>
