        <p>The Devils accomplished something tonight that had not happened in a National Hockey League game in 78 years: two of their players, Randy McKay and John Madden, scored four goals each in a 9-0 trouncing of the Pittsburgh Penguins at Mellon Arena.</p>
        <p>''It was pretty amazing, that's for sure,'' Martin Brodeur, who earned his first shutout of the season and the 43rd of his career, said of the accomplishment. ''It was amazing to be ahead by so many goals and see our defense not relax even for a minute.''</p>

        <p>The Devils accomplished something tonight that had not happened in a National Hockey League game in 78 years: two of their players, Randy McKay and John Madden, scored four goals each in a 9-0 trouncing of the Pittsburgh Penguins at Mellon Arena.</p>
        <p>''It was pretty amazing, that's for sure,'' Martin Brodeur, who earned his first shutout of the season and the 43rd of his career, said of the accomplishment. ''It was amazing to be ahead by so many goals and see our defense not relax even for a minute.''</p>
        <p>The last time two players scored four goals in a game was Jan. 14, 1922, when Odie Cleghorn and Sprague Cleghorn led the Montreal Canadiens to a 10-6 victory over the Hamilton Tigers.</p>
        <p>McKay and Madden are not known for their scoring prowess, but they were, in the words of McKay, ''in the right spot at the right time.''</p>
        <p>''It was one of those nights that when I touched the puck, it went in,'' McKay said. ''Guys on the bench couldn't believe it. Bobby Holik was shaking his head every time we went to the bench after a goal.''</p>
        <p>Madden, whose only goal in the first seven games this season came in the 3-3 tie in Carolina a night earlier, had joked with McKay on the bench that he was going for five.</p>
        <p>''I was just happy to score one,'' Madden said later when discussing his remark. ''Things went our way because we played a solid game all around.''</p>
        <p>Devils Coach Larry Robinson said he did not  remember any two players ever scoring four goals in a game, even in youth hockey.</p>
        <p>''It's just great for both guys,'' Robinson said. ''They worked extremely hard.''</p>
        <p>Turner Stevenson scored the first goal of the game. He joked afterward in a happy dressing room that nobody had noticed that he had scored the winning goal.</p>
        <p>While the Devils played with inspiration in their first meeting of the season against division rivals, the Penguins were listless for the most part. They had only three shots on Brodeur in the opening period, while allowing the Devils to score four times.</p>
        <p>The victory catapulted the Devils (5-2-2-0) past the Penguins (5-4-1-0) to the top of the Atlantic Division.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh replaced goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin for the start of the second period after he allowed 4 goals on 16 shots. He is 0-5 against the Devils.</p>
        <p>Garth Snow, who replaced Aubin, received the same treatment by the Devils, who scored 4 times in the second period on 15 shots.</p>
        <p>McKay scored the last two goals against Aubin, including the Devils' first power-play goal of the night. It came with 8 minutes 42 seconds left in the first period. McKay's second goal came with 29.9 seconds remaining in the period. He notched his third career hat trick at 12:32 of the second period and his first four-goal game with 2:16 left in the second.</p>
        <p>''Never scored four goals before, not at this level,'' McKay said. ''I have to go back to high school for the last time I did this.''</p>
        <p>Madden scored his first of the night at 4:45 of the opening period and gave the Devils a 5-0 lead with his second goal at 11:10 of the middle period. His third goal came with 1:13 left in the second period, and he closed the scoring with 4:05 left in the game.</p>
        <p>McKay and Madden are the first Devils to score hat tricks in the same game since Feb. 13, 1989, when Brendan Shanahan, now with Detroit, and Pat Verbeek, now with Dallas, did so in an 8-1 victory over Toronto.</p>
        <p>Center Sergei Nemchinov, who assisted on the Devils' first two goals, found himself in an unfamiliar role. With Petr Sykora nursing a groin injury, and the restricted free agents Jason Arnott and Scott Niedermayer still unsigned, Nemchinov played the right point on the power play.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DON MEEHAN, the agent for JASON ARNOTT and SCOTT NIEDERMAYER, will be visiting the New York metropolitan area Sunday for business with the Rangers and may meet with LOU LAMORIELLO, the president and general manager of the Devils, in an attempt to end the contract dispute with the two restricted free agents. . . . Devils defenseman WILLIE MITCHELL was a healthy scratch for the fifth consecutive game. SASCHA GOC took Mitchell's place five games ago and has kept it by playing well. . . . With PETR SYKORA and JAY PANDOLFO out, ED WARD made his second appearance of the season for the Devils, playing 47 seconds in the opening period. . . . Saturday began a stretch of five games in seven nights for the Devils. They will play host to Florida on Monday and to Philadelphia on Wednesday.</p>
