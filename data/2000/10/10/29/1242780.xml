        <p>THE greeting is standard-issue cheery (''Hi. How are  you?), but the tone is caustic and the speaker is known to be forbidding.</p>
        <p>That's how Vivian Bearing, Ph.D.,  a professor of 17th-century poetry, specializing in the Holy Sonnets of John Donne, welcomes the audience  at the George Street Playhouse here,  and she makes sure that we know it is not her standard greeting.</p>
        <p>It is forced and fake, laced with  bitterness and irony, reinforced by the hospital gown and ID bracelet  she wears.</p>
        <p>Vivian wastes no time telling us that she knows she is in a play and that she thinks she dies at the end.  The play covers eight months of experimental chemotherapy during her battle with metastatic ovarian cancer. Followers of theater that  counts, or even just the Pulitzer Prize winners, know that the play is ''Wit,'' a perfectly titled contemplation of the poetry of life and death.</p>
        <p>For all its honors, a play that dissects words like ''antineoplastic'' and talks of invasive epithelial carcinoma is still resisted by many people. Besides, references to metaphysics, critical reading and Donne's explorations of mortality can be as off-putting as death to people who go to shows to be entertained. And this show ends not just with the death of a  ravaged woman of 50, but with a medical foul-up about the instruction: Do Not Resuscitate.</p>
        <p>Yet, it is imprecise to say that's how ''Wit'' ends, not when the memory can be forever haunted by the play's final vision, and a glorious, affirming vision it is. Say simply that ''Wit'' has a textual ending and a visual one and no one is going to remember the words without looking them up, though it must be emphasized that the last luminous image is  dictated by the stage directions of the playwright, Margaret Edson.</p>
        <p>''Wit'' is a play of nobility. Funny how some people think it is odd or surprising that a kindergarten teacher wrote it.</p>
        <p>The acclaimed, now historic, production that began life in 1997 at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn., ran successfully off-Broadway, first in a nonprofit theater, then commercially.</p>
        <p>It is not irrelevant to note that Broadway would not take a chance on it, and that Ms. Edson's script was initially rejected by 60 regional theaters. George Street, under its former management, was one. Call it artistic justice that ''Wit'' is now here.</p>
        <p>Like all masterworks, Ms. Edson's play is subject to different valid interpretations, and will go on, fittingly, into eternity. But it would be naive to say that Ted Sod's staging, at times more didactic than dramatic, is comparable to the classic one by Doug Hughes. Somehow, the cast can be separated simplistically: The women in this production are better than the men, who do not transcend  stereotype, and that's that.</p>
        <p>Start, as one must, with Suzzanne Douglas, a vibrant, defiant Vivian, a life force debilitated, truly transmitting a palpable rage against the dying of the light. If anyone thinks Ms. Douglas looks too good to be playing a dying woman, it is likely that she is being seen for the first time. Ms. Douglas is simply paying the price of  outer beauty, not that she fails to radiate inner beauty as well. The  sight of a bald Vivian, who usually  wears a cap, is intended to startle. It does, but not as intended. And, yes,  the actress is made up to appear  gaunt and frail.</p>
        <p>Ms. Douglas effectively depicts Vivian as a tough lady, demanding and uncompromising in her scholarly standards, meticulous in her  intolerance of a semicolon when a comma is essential. If Vivian is more  passionate about punctuation than about people, that's Vivian. But Ms.  Edson's point about an abrasive woman of intellect making a last-minute human connection is less convincing than it is supposed to be, though the importance of that point, and the notion that Vivian was too tough and heartless as a teacher, are arguable. That's just one aspect of a rich, many-layered play.</p>
        <p>Emotion to spare is provided by  Helen Gallagher as Vivian's colleague, immensely moving in a bedside scene, and Jodi Somers, very  strong and poignant as a caring registered nurse.</p>
        <p>During this important run, the theater is holding a number of post-performance discussions. There is a lobby display of selections from a sculpture series inspired by National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and a Remembrance Wall on which people can write, sketch or post pictures and mementos relating to life- threatening illnesses.</p>
        <p>And in an act of giving, from one theater that thrives to another in  crisis, George Street is offering free ''Wit'' tickets to subscribers who were shut out of Crossroads, the  company next door. Vouchers, which were mailed to patrons of Crossroads when that theater canceled its entire season, are redeemable, in person or by mail, for any remaining performances. Seats were still available Thursday, a George Street representative said.</p>
        <p>No matter how you take it, ''Wit'' is life-enhancing.</p>
        <p>'WIT'  George Street Playhouse, 9 Livingstone Avenue, New Brunswick.</p>
        <p>Performances through Nov. 12, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., with an additional Thursday performance at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tickets: $24 to $40.</p>
