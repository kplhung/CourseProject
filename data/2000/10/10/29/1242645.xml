        <p>ONE of my clearest memories of adolescence is of a T-shirt, worn by a fellow eighth-grader whose name I don't remember, but on whom I seem to recall having a crush. It was black, with hot-pink French-cut sleeves, and across the front was a precis of recent American history: ''50's were grease/60's were grass/70's are gross.'' At the time, this account seemed irrefutable. By nearly universal agreement, there had never been a worse time to be alive, and to be young was especially miserable. We were growing up in the aftermath of a vaguely heroic, splendidly tumultuous age -- ''the Sixties, man'' -- whose life-changing intensity we could never hope to know. The landscape around us was dull, ugly and decadent, and we seemed condemned to drag into adulthood the crippling sense of having been born too late.</p>
        <p>But that was a long time ago. Over the past decade, the 70's have been rediscovered and gradually rehabilitated. The decade that introduced the word ''malaise'' into the popular lexicon has gone from being a subject of affectionate ridicule to being an object of outright longing, a golden age. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the movies. Soundtracks swell with dinosaur-rock anthems and Philly soul ballads; actors deck themselves out in flared pants, wide-collared open-necked shirts, fringed suede jackets and high-heeled boots, sometimes all at once, in hectic defiance of actual fashion history, but in tribute to a time we now seem to remember as fresh, fun and, of all things, innocent.</p>

        <p>ONE of my clearest memories of adolescence is of a T-shirt, worn by a fellow eighth-grader whose name I don't remember, but on whom I seem to recall having a crush. It was black, with hot-pink French-cut sleeves, and across the front was a precis of recent American history: ''50's were grease/60's were grass/70's are gross.'' At the time, this account seemed irrefutable. By nearly universal agreement, there had never been a worse time to be alive, and to be young was especially miserable. We were growing up in the aftermath of a vaguely heroic, splendidly tumultuous age -- ''the Sixties, man'' -- whose life-changing intensity we could never hope to know. The landscape around us was dull, ugly and decadent, and we seemed condemned to drag into adulthood the crippling sense of having been born too late.</p>
        <p>But that was a long time ago. Over the past decade, the 70's have been rediscovered and gradually rehabilitated. The decade that introduced the word ''malaise'' into the popular lexicon has gone from being a subject of affectionate ridicule to being an object of outright longing, a golden age. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the movies. Soundtracks swell with dinosaur-rock anthems and Philly soul ballads; actors deck themselves out in flared pants, wide-collared open-necked shirts, fringed suede jackets and high-heeled boots, sometimes all at once, in hectic defiance of actual fashion history, but in tribute to a time we now seem to remember as fresh, fun and, of all things, innocent.</p>
        <p>In the past year or so, the cinematic 70's revival has accelerated. We have seen the cheerful Watergate revisionism of ''Dick'' and the sticky New York nightmare of ''Summer of Sam'' in the summer of 1999, Sofia Coppola's dreamy ''Virgin Suicides'' of last spring and ''Almost Famous,'' Cameron Crowe's recently released love letter to his own well-spent youth. Two highlights of this past dreary summer were Allison MacLean's druggy shaggy-dog story ''Jesus' Son'' and Alan Moyle's bittersweet Canadian teen-angst comedy ''New Waterford Girl.'' And even movies that aren't set in the 70's avail themselves of real and imaginary archetypes of the period: the protagonist of Tim Meadows's new ''Ladies Man'' is a kind of blaxploitation Austin Powers, a parody of something that never quite existed, but might as well have. This week, of course, the motion-picture adaptation of ''Charlie's Angels'' will be released, teleporting Aaron Spelling's slice of hard-boiled mid-70's television cheesecake into the age of lad magazines and post-feminist girl power.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the decade's surviving icons refuse to fade. On my best friend's bedroom wall, around 1977, there were two posters: Peter Frampton and Farrah Fawcett, sporting remarkably similar hairdos. Ms. Fawcett -- one of the original Angels -- can currently be seen disporting naked in a shopping mall fountain in Robert Altman's ''Dr. T and the Women.'' The years, it seems, have been kinder to her than they have to Mr. Frampton, who shows up (fully clothed) as a grizzled road manager in ''Almost Famous,'' a movie for which he also served as a musical consultant. (Mr. Crowe, the film's director, wrote the album liner notes for ''Frampton Comes Alive,'' which sold untold millions of copies in 1976, very few of which anyone would admit to owning five years later.)</p>
        <p>These films' recycling of 70's pop culture is more than just the latest example of the kitschy collagism that has been ubiquitous in music and movies since, oh, the early 80's. There is, needless to say, more than a bit of tongue-in-cheek, Nick at Nite-style appropriation in the very idea of making a feature out of ''Charlie's Angels.'' But the dustbin of history, a bottomless gold mine of recyclable styles and images, is also a repository of forgotten treasures and a valuable memory bank. What's notable about ''Almost Famous,'' for example (and the cause of some grumpy criticism of it), is the movie's almost defiant sincerity, a quality it shares with ''The Virgin Suicides'' and ''Jesus' Son,'' as well as with the three great achievements of mid-90's mid-70's revivalism -- Spike Lee's ''Crooklyn,'' Richard Linklater's ''Dazed and Confused'' and Ang Lee's ''Ice Storm.''</p>
        <p>The defining moment in Mr. Crowe's movie -- the one likely to determine whether you dismiss the film's sentimental view of the 70's rock scene or embrace it -- comes when the members of the fictional band Stillwater, their road crew and groupies, and the boy journalist William Miller sing along to Elton John's ''Tiny Dancer.'' They momentarily lay aside their sexual and professional troubles and croon, with soft voices and melting eyes, as if Bernie Taupin's maudlin, almost nonsensical lyrics were written on their souls. A similar sequence occurs in Ms. Coppola's film, when the Lisbon sisters, forbidden by their parents to see the boys who worship them, communicate over the telephone by playing selected album tracks. Both films try to rescue 70's pop music -- both specific songs and the very idea of it -- from the derision of history and restore its authentic power, which is to express emotions too powerful, or too embarrassing, for words.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most unabashed declaration of generational loyalty in a recent movie comes in Spike Lee's concert film, ''The Original Kings of Comedy.'' Each of the four stand-up comedians, all black men in their 40's, swears a general allegiance to the past. ''I'm old school,'' declares Cedric the Entertainer. The master of ceremonies, Steve Harvey, hones the idea of old school to a precise chronological point: ''I'm a 1974 brother,'' he says, wrapping himself in the luscious romanticism of Lenny Williams and Teddy Pendergrass, whose music swells with the kind of emotion that hip-hop, in Mr. Harvey's view, disdains.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee, who has done more than any other filmmaker to bring the confrontational dynamism of politicized, East Coast rap into movies, has his own ties to the old school. ''Crooklyn,'' his most personal ''joint'' (and a scandalously underappreciated movie) painstakingly reconstructs the world of his own Brooklyn childhood in the era of Walt Frazier and Rock'em Sock'em robots. Like the Michigan suburb of ''Virgin Suicides,'' Mr. Lee's Bedford-Stuyvesant is a world poised on the brink of vanishing. ''Remember back in the days when kids didn't act so crazy?'' the title song on the soundtracks wonders, simultaneously longing for the safety of childhood and a better, bygone time.</p>
        <p>Was it a better time? It's impossible to say. One of the curious aspects of cultural memory in an age of mass culture is that specific moments and experiences are at once unique and interchangeable. In a recent speaking engagement at Lincoln Center, Richard Linklater remarked that for all its meticulous recreation of Texas in the late spring of 1976, his film ''Dazed and Confused'' tells a story that anyone who grew up in the United States after World War II could recognize. History repeats itself: the first time it's gross, the second time it's glorious.</p>
