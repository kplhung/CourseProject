        <p>Two Faces of Liberalism</p>
        <p>By John Gray.</p>
        <p>161 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The New Press. $25.</p>
        <p>The word ''liberalism'' has very different associations in England from those that it evokes in these United States. There, political liberals are supposed to care especially about liberty -- favoring, for example, the abolition of legal restraints on drug use, consensual sex and suicide -- while economic liberals are especially preoccupied with the free market and property rights. Here, in a country where everyone at least pays lip service to liberty and the free market, liberalism's most distinctive concern is with the economic conditions of the disadvantaged, which in Europe would be the focus of the Socialist left. Despite this divide in our public vocabularies and practices, there is a lively trans-Atlantic philosophical conversation about the meaning of the liberal tradition. The pre-eminent figures in this debate are John Rawls, in the United States, and the late Sir Isaiah Berlin, in England.</p>
        <p>These two very different figures reflect the political gap with which I began. Rawls is much more ambitious regarding the government's role in defending the worst off. Sir Isaiah, on the other hand, was an exile from Soviet Russia who spent much of his life warning of the dangers of government's infringement upon our freedoms in the name of a higher good. Faced with the three-part slogan of the French Revolution, both support liberty, Rawls adds equality, and neither has very much time for fraternity.</p>
        <p>John Gray, who teaches at the London School of Economics, is a leading scholar of this liberal tradition. He has published a much-discussed study of Isaiah Berlin, editions of the writings of John Stuart Mill -- the greatest of the 19th-century English liberals -- and a book entitled ''Liberalisms.'' He is the author, too, of a work on ''postliberalism,'' which conforms to the rule that to be ''post'' something is usually also to be at least a little bit against it. Gray's new book, ''Two Faces of Liberalism,'' certainly aims, in the same spirit, to take us beyond the current debate. As a result, his first task is to contest the existing framework of assumptions.</p>
        <p>His complaints against Rawls -- which can stand in for complaints about much American liberal philosophy -- are manifold. (Indeed, Gray's approach to American liberalism is reminiscent of Prof. Quincy Adams Wagstaff, the Groucho Marx character in ''Horse Feathers,'' who sings, ''Whatever it is, I'm against it.'') He finds Rawls guilty of ''legalism'' because he wants to preserve our rights through a constitution that effectively removes many matters from political debate, putting them, as our system's domestic opponents often say, in the hands of unelected judges. This legalism not only expresses a hostility to politics, Gray argues, but it also depends on the assumption that when rights conflict, those judges can decide which right should triumph without having to rely on controversial moral views. His point is that the decision of which right to favor very often depends on contested moral claims.</p>
        <p>It is here that we find Gray's deepest quarrel with much of recent American liberal philosophy. He opposes what he calls the liberal ''ideal of rational consensus,'' which supposes that reasonable people must, in the end, agree that one set of fundamental political arrangements is the best. If that were true, then it would indeed be possible, as Rawls proposed, to put the political system itself forever beyond political dispute. But Rawls believes, like most of his peers in liberal philosophy, that there are many questions about how we should live our lives that we do not need to agree upon. It is therefore, I believe, hyperbolic to say, as Gray does, that ''the predominant liberal view of toleration sees it as a means to a universal civilization.'' Nevertheless, Rawls does think we have reason to accept the value of certain fundamental human rights, and that these provide the basis for shaping a constitution, while Gray believes, by contrast, that almost nothing about constitutional arrangements or basic rights can be settled in advance of political debate.</p>
        <p>To replace the program of Rawls and his team, Gray offers what he calls the liberalism of ''modus vivendi.'' ''The end of modus vivendi,'' he says early on, ''is not any supreme good -- even peace. It is reconciling conflicting goods. That is why modus vivendi can be pursued by ways of life having opposing views of the good.''</p>
        <p>All people, Gray suggests, whatever their way of life, have an interest in coexistence. There are also certain universal evils that endanger a worthwhile human life based on any conception of the good. ''To be tortured, or forced to witness the torture of loved ones or compatriots; to be separated from one's friends, family or country; to be subjected to humiliation or persecution, or threatened with genocide; to be locked in poverty or avoidable ill health -- these are great evils for all who suffer them. Insofar as a conception of the good does not encompass these experiences, it is defective, even delusive.'' So he is in favor of an international regime of human rights to protect people from these universal evils. ''There are minimal standards of decency and legitimacy that apply to all contemporary regimes, but they are not liberal values writ large.''</p>
        <p>Gray's argument for modus vivendi and against the liberalism of rational consensus relies heavily on what Isaiah Berlin called ''pluralism,'' the view that ''not all questions about the good have one true answer.'' Confucian ideals of loyalty to family and friends and Protestant individualism, for example, may well suggest different notions of the good, and the pluralist holds that neither need be wrong. Because they value things differently, upholders of these different ways of life will sometimes not be able to agree to the liberal framework of rights. The devout may want a society in which blasphemy is a crime; the prudish may desire a society in which pornography is proscribed. For them, freedom of expression cannot extend to blasphemy or to smut. The defenders of free speech will reply that all are free to turn a deaf ear to offensive speech, or to exercise their own freedom to condemn it, but that restraining it offends against the rights of the pornographer. In such cases, Gray argues, we cannot guarantee that one view will be correct and the other mistaken. Value pluralism means there can be more than one way of being right. Gray's view, in effect, is that there is less of a consensus on moral matters across the various ways of life than liberal theorists suppose. What is more, some of the most important disagreements that divide people and nations cannot be settled by reason alone.</p>
        <p>You might think that the proper liberal response would be to say, as Isaiah Berlin did, that people should be left to make their own choices. The only value that the government should uphold, once it has ensured the peace, is personal autonomy. Not, of course, in the form of a fancy philosophical theory, but just by letting people take responsibility for making their own lives. But that is where John Gray thinks that contemporary liberals on both sides of the Atlantic get it wrong. Once you plump for personal autonomy, you are taking sides. Personal autonomy will argue for the abolition of blasphemy laws and permitting pornography, and at that point the devout and the prudish have a problem. If the importance of autonomy is one of the issues about which there are many true answers, then liberalism is imposing its answer on people who have a reasonable, if different, answer of their own.</p>
        <p>Pluralist liberals will respond with varying degrees of vehemence. Some will argue, robustly, that autonomy is necessary for everyone, regardless of tradition, if you are to live a life that is good by your own standards. Others will maintain, less robustly, that while autonomy has, indeed, not been part of every tradition, this fact raises few problems in a world where everybody is increasingly coming round to the liberal celebration of autonomy.</p>
        <p>Gray anticipates both lines of argument. He says, for example, that some Asian immigrants in Western countries provide an example of people who have prospered ''without adopting personal autonomy as an ideal.'' But most liberals are not likely to find this very convincing. If you believe that autonomy is a central human value, you will deny that those who seek to live without it are doing well, or at least as well as they could. The robust liberal response is not going to put off by the bare assertion of the contrary. And the less robust defender of the practicality of liberalism is not bound to accept Gray's rather sketchy description of these Asian immigrants. It is at least arguable that most South Asian immigrants in Britain and East Asian immigrants in the United States, like many people who have stayed in Asia, have become increasingly attracted to autonomy of a sort. Gray dismisses those of us who believe this as ''Americanocentric,'' but that is more insult than argument.</p>
