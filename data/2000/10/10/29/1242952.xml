        <p>October may have been a tough month for the stock market, but it was profitable, as usual, for Alaskans.</p>
        <p>By now, every man, woman and child who has lived in the state for at least a calendar year should have received an annual dividend check from the Alaska Permanent Fund. This year, a record $1,963.86 was distributed to each of the 585,800 eligible residents.</p>
        <p>The fund was set up about two decades ago as a way for Alaska to support itself after its oil fields run dry. Half of the fund's annual earnings are reinvested; the other half are distributed to Alaskans every October.</p>
        <p>Like many other investors, the state fund has profited from the booming stock market of recent years, growing from nearly $15 billion in 1995 to just under $28 billion this year. Likewise, the annual dividend has grown rapidly -- in 1995, Alaskans received $990.30 each.</p>
        <p>The annual windfall fuels a spending spree, which accounts for as much as 10 percent of annual spending in Alaska, according to state economists.</p>
        <p>''One can attribute a lot of the growth in the Alaskan economy in the last decade to the growing dividend,'' Scott Goldsmith, an economics professor at the University of Alaska at Anchorage, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.</p>
