        <p>THE long bull market has left some people with more wealth than they -- and their children -- will ever need. But barring some extreme act of profligacy by their immediate heirs, the super-rich face the prospect of having that money whittled away again and again by estate taxes with each passing generation.</p>
        <p>There is an alternative, though, for those who are concerned about their financial legacies to distant descendants. Called a ''dynasty trust,'' it provides -- as most trusts do -- substantial tax savings for the person setting it up. And the money is never again subject to estate taxes.</p>
        <p>The trusts are still available only in some states, but anyone can travel to those states to set one up.</p>
        <p>''Dynasty trusts are tremendously attractive, because wealth builds up quickly when it can be passed on without paying estate taxes at each successive generation,'' said Gideon Rothschild, a partner at Moses &amp; Singer, a law firm in New York.</p>
        <p>If a dynasty trust of roughly $1 million was established today, Mr. Rothschild figured, it would be worth $867.7 million after four generations, assuming that it grew 7 percent a year and nothing was spent. By contrast, it would be worth $35.6 million if the property was given outright to future generations and was subject each time to an estate tax of up to 55 percent.</p>
        <p>For a century, wealthy families like the Rockefellers have created intergenerational trusts called family trusts. In 1986, Congress capped tax-free contributions at $1 million, indexed for inflation to $1.03 million this year, and most states limit trusts to roughly 100 years by adopting a version of the 16th-century British common-law doctrine called the rule against perpetuities.</p>
        <p>The rule was devised by kings who feared that land given in return for service to the crown would be left to people who had no obligation for such service. Under the rule, a trust had to terminate 21 years after the death of a specified person living at the time the trust is created.</p>
        <p>So far, 13 states have eliminated  rules against perpetuities, making dynasty trusts possible. South Dakota, Wisconsin and Idaho were first, in 1983. Other states followed suit starting in 1996 -- most recently New Jersey in 1999 and Rhode Island this year. Starting in 2001, Floridians will be able to create 360-year trusts. New York and Missouri, among others, are debating similar moves.</p>
        <p>Critics say dynasty trusts will further increase the concentration of wealth, can benefit people estranged from the donor and encourage litigation over the right to money from the fund and over how it is invested.</p>
        <p>Alan Halpern, an estate tax specialist at Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan, says that if the estate tax is repealed or limited to billionaires, heirs of those who create dynasty trusts may be unhappy. ''Can you imagine if there is no estate tax and all this wealth is tied up in perpetuity?'' he said.</p>
        <p>The tax savings can be considerable. No federal gift taxes are owed when the trust is set up with assets valued at the amount protected by the one-time ''federal unified credit,'' now $675,000 a person. The assets are not taxed in the donor's estate and can be free from state income taxes, depending on where the trust is set up. (South Dakota and Delaware, among others, generally levy no tax.) Finally, the trust can be structured so that assets are free from creditors' claims, ex-spouses or lawsuits against beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Dynasty trusts are often established as ''defective grantor trusts,'' in which income is taxed not to the trust but to the person who created it. By paying the tax, the trust creator makes additional tax-free gifts. But Mr. Rothschild advises giving the trustee power to convert it to a nongrantor trust, to allow the trust creator to opt out of paying taxes.</p>
        <p>Because dynasty trusts are long term, the trust document should include provisions to adjust for changing family circumstances and to allow modification or termination of the trust if the estate tax is repealed. Most important, but often neglected, is a statement of why the trust was created, said Laura H. Peebles, director in the Washington national tax office of Deloitte &amp; Touche.</p>
        <p>''What your kids, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will do with the money is more important than what Uncle Sam will do with his share,'' Ms. Peebles said. Often, the creator of a trust outlines his or her philosophy in a separate document, to avoid having it construed as legally binding. Some people want a trust used for education expenses, while others direct trustees to distribute income only when heirs fall below a certain standard of living.</p>
        <p>The cost of setting up a dynasty trust varies. A simple lifetime trust established outside the home state of the trust creator costs $5,000 to $7,500 or more, depending on the complexity.</p>
