        <p>ALL seven State Assembly members from Westchester received perfect scores on the annual Voter's Guide issued by EPL/Environmental Advocates, a lobbying group.</p>
        <p>The guide, one of the first environmental score cards in the nation, gave a rating of 93 out of a possible 100 points to State Senator Suzi Oppenheimer, a Port Chester Democrat, and a rating of 80 to State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Yonkers Republican.</p>
        <p>The scores reflect the percentage of times a legislator voted in line with policies backed by the advocacy organization, said Jeff Jones, a spokesman for the group.</p>
        <p>While the lawmakers said they respected the efforts of the environmental advocacy group, Mr. Spano noted that in several cases, he did not agree with their position this year. For example, he lost points for supporting a measure, which passed in the Senate but was not introduced in the Assembly, that would have allowed the Department of Environmental Conservation to issue a 40-year lease to a for-profit company to run a ski center in a state forest preserve in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano said he believed the bill would have helped tourism and not hurt the environment. But Environmental Advocates argued that it would have caused substantial harm.</p>
        <p>This year the Assembly did not pass any bill opposed by Environmental Advocates, and 77 legislators garnered perfect scores. Assembly Democrats averaged 99; Assembly Republicans, 85.</p>
        <p>The Westchester Assembly members are Michael J. Spano of Yonkers, the sole Republican Assemblyman from the county, and James Gary Pretlow of Mount Vernon, Ronald C. Tocci of New Rochelle, Richard L. Brodsky of Greenburgh, Audrey G. Hochberg of Scarsdale, Naomi C. Matusow of Mount Kisco and Sandra R. Galef of Ossining.</p>
        <p>The average Senate score this year was 84. Senate Republicans averaged 81 -- their highest ever score -- and Democrats averaged 86.</p>
        <p>''What's really noteworthy is that the Senate and Governor this year finally supported bills that the Assembly has been trying to move ahead for years,'' said Mr. Brodsky, who is the chairman of the Environment Committee. ''Previously the bills passed in the Assembly and the Senate and Governor dumped them, but they realized they couldn't run again successfully without supporting these measures.''</p>
        <p>Among the bills that passed in both chambers was the Jet Skis Emissions Control Law, introduced into the Assembly by Ms. Matusow, a member of the Environment Committee. Her bill, which was signed into law on Sept. 11, authorizes the Department of Environmental Conservation to adopt regulations consistent with those in California regulating emissions from personal watercraft. Moreover, it has stricter requirements than those mandated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Other bills included one to create a Scrap Tires Recycling Council to deal with waste tires. It was introduced in the Assembly by Mrs. Hochberg and has been signed into law.</p>
