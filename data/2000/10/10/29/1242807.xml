        <p>It was a New Jersey kind of week.</p>
        <p>Two mayors -- one from the north the other from the south -- found themselves tangled in legal troubles and political fallout.</p>
        <p>In Union City, a political minefield in the heart of Hudson County, Mayor Rudy Garcia handed in his resignation on Tuesday afternoon, and was replaced the same evening by three of his former allies on the city Board of Commissioners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia, who is also a state assemblyman and treasurer of the state Democratic Party, was facing a possible recall election led by the man who replaced him as mayor, as well as an investigation by the state attorney general's office into finances of the city and the local Democratic organization he headed until June.</p>
        <p>One day earlier and 15 exits down the New Jersey Turnpike, the federal corruption trial of Mayor Milton Milan began at the United States Courthouse in Camden, the very city Mr. Milan was elected to lead. In the opening round of a trial expected last up to six weeks, lawyers for Mr. Milan and the United States Attorney's office began selecting jurors who will decide whether Mr. Milan is guilty of charges that he took more than $30,000 in payments in exchange for steering a city contract to a business controlled by organized crime.</p>
        <p>Despite a resolution from the city council urging him to resign as mayor, Mr. Milan has steadfastly refused to do so. A conviction would force him to.</p>
        <p>On the surface, there are some similarities between the two men: Mr. Garcia is 36 and Mr. Milan 37; both grew up in poor in the cities they went on to lead; both are Democrats; and both are of Hispanic descent -- Mr. Garcia is Cuban and Mr. Milan Puerto Rican.</p>
        <p>But the similarities do not go much further. Mr. Milan ran with a rough crowd that he has acknowledged included drug dealers, while Mr. Garcia ran with a football, earning all-state honors in high school. Mr. Milan joined the Marine Corps, then started a construction company, while Mr. Garcia went to Columbia University and, after law school at New York University, joined a prestigious Manhattan firm.</p>
        <p>Their current circumstances are also distinct. Camden's municipal finances are under scrutiny by a court-appointed monitor, with legislation pending that would amount to a state takeover of the city. Union City has a budget deficit, but by no means has it been in the same kind of perpetual financial straits as Camden. And of course, Mr. Milan has been indicted on federal corruption charges, while Mr. Garcia has not been accused of any wrongdoing although the state has subpoenaed records relating to his political and governmental activities.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, however, it is Mr. Garcia who has resigned, and Mr. Milan who has held on to the reins of city government even as he shuttles between city hall and the federal courthouse.</p>
        <p>Some observers attribute the different reactions of the two men to the difference in their principal opponents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia's antagonist was a savvy grass-roots politician named Brian Stack, who saw in the city's budget deficit the chance to unseat Mr. Garcia and install himself -- with help from Representative Robert Menendez, whom Mr. Garcia had clashed with in recent years.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Stack and Mr. Menendez are merely politicians themselves and depending on his political skills, his remaining allies and his popularity, Mr. Garcia could theoretically recover from last week's political defeat. For now, at least, Mr. Garcia insists that he plans to seek re-election to the Assembly even though Mr. Stack says he will back City Commissioner Rafael Fraguela in the Democratic primary.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Milan has his share of political foes, including the Whitman administration, which installed the fiscal monitor despite his protestations. But his chief enemies now are federal prosecutors, and a defeat at their hands -- a criminal conviction on corruption charges -- would end even the most savvy politician's career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milan has virtually no option but to cling to power, hoping he will be acquitted.</p>
        <p>''I think when the political opponent is the government, rather than a rival politician, the presumption is that there is wrongdoing,'' said Cliff Zukin, a professor at Rutgers University's Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy.</p>
        <p>Noting the difference between the political outlooks of the two embattled young mayors, Professor Zukin said, ''When you have a federal indictment, I think that carries a lot of weight in the public's mind.''</p>
        <p>In terms of what the two men's constituents may be left with, Union City has already installed Mr. Stack as mayor in a virtually seamless transition that by last Wednesday had him moving into Mr. Garcia's spacious office at city hall. Mr. Stack said he would run in a special election in November to fill Mr. Garcia's unexpired term, then head a commission slate for full four-year terms in May 2002.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Milan, if he is acquitted he can seek a second four-year term in May 2001. But if convicted, the people of Camden will have an interim mayor chosen by, and perhaps among, members of the City Council.</p>
        <p>''Historically, they would select from within,'' said Marc Riondino, the city attorney.</p>
        <p>The threat to Mr. Milan's political career is criminal, and it is unlikely that any degree of politicking can ease that threat.</p>
        <p>Talking about Mr. Garcia's circumstances, however, Mr. Riondino said that deficits and subpoenas by no means snuff a political life, particularly in Hudson County. And he questioned whether Mr. Garcia might have salvaged his job as mayor if he had not alienated himself politically.</p>
        <p>''I think these are very different political circumstances,'' Professor Zukin said. ''When you look at Garcia, you look at the fact that there's an internal power struggle there, and one of his opponents is Bob Menendez, one of the most powerful Democratic officials in the state. So Garcia is stepping down because he's lost a political battle for support.''</p>
