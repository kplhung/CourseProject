        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Moving back to Westchester two years ago from Minneapolis meant confronting the challenge of grocery shopping head-on. I immediately subscribed to a Brooklyn-based organic produce delivery service, which I am thrilled with. Moreover, I am e-mailing online grocery services, like Webvan, to encourage them to expand to the East Coast. I also stop by Bread and Circus in western Massachusetts to stock up on pantry items while visiting my parents, and my local market in Irvington is perfect for picking up bread and milk.</p>

        <p>Westchester residents should look into shopping alternatives and stop patronizing businesses that are unable or unwilling to meet their needs.</p>
