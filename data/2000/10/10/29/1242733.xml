        <p>THE more delicate the ingredient, the less marinating it takes. And nothing illustrates the point better than fish.</p>
        <p>A half-hour or so of steeping in a spicy rub or acidic concoction is enough to infuse a nice edge of flavor in a fillet.</p>
        <p>Take it longer than that, and you have ceviche, a preparation of seafood marinated long enough (six hours or so) to change the texture from raw to the density of cooked.</p>
        <p>And these days, chefs are even preparing ''fresh'' ceviches in which slices of raw fish are quckly doused in a citric mixture, then served.</p>
        <p>The following recipes require relatively brief marinating.</p>
        <p>Flavorings of mustard, curry and the fragrant spicings of North Africa result.</p>
        <p>Mustard-Marinated Sole</p>
        <p>Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons red-wine vinegar</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon grainy mustard</p>
        <p>4 gray sole fillets, about 1 1/2 pounds</p>
        <p>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons finely minced shallots</p>
        <p>1/4 cup flour</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Beat vinegar and mustard together. Brush fish with one-and-a-half tablespoons of this mixture and allow to sit for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Heat four tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet. Add shallots and saute over medium heat until golden. Stir in remaining vinegar mixture, remove contents of pan and set aside. Wipe out pan.</p>
        <p>3. Dust fish with flour to coat. Add remaining oil to pan and heat. Add fish to pan and saute until lightly browned, about three minutes on eachr side. Pour reserved vinegar, oil and shallot mixture over fish. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving platter, sprinkle with parsley and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Baked Snapper In Chermoula</p>
        <p>Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon minced cilantro leaves</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf parsley leaves</p>
        <p>2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon hot Hungarian paprika</p>
        <p>2 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon ground coriander</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1 small green bell pepper, cored, seeded and sliced</p>
        <p>1 medium-size onion, peeled and coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>2 pounds red snapper fillets</p>
        <p>8 ripe plum tomatoes</p>
        <p>1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped</p>
        <p>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1 lemon, cut in 6 wedges.</p>
        <p>1. Combine cilantro, parsley, garlic, paprika, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Rub fish with this mixture, called chermoula. Scatter green pepper and onion in glass or ceramic baking dish big enough to hold fish in a single layer. Put fish atop vegetables, cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Put rack in highest position.</p>
        <p>3. Slice four of the tomatoes thin and puree the rest. Scatter tomato slices and jalapeno over fish. Mix pureed tomatoes with olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over fish. Cover loosely with foil.</p>
        <p>4. Put in oven and bake about 15 minutes, until fish is just cooked through. Serve at once with lemon wedges.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Sea Bass In Cilantro-Curry Chutney</p>
        <p>Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>1/2 cup unsalted shelled pistachios</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon finely minced fresh ginger</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon minced cilantro leaves</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon minced fresh mint leaves</p>
        <p>1/2 cup plain yogurt</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons curry powder</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>4 sea bass fillets, about 1 1/2 pounds</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>Cilantro sprigs and lime wedges for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Lightly toast pistachios by heating in skillet, stirring, two to three minutes. Grind in food processor, blender or spice mill. Combine with ginger, cilantro, mint, yogurt, curry powder, lime juice, salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Put fish in glass or ceramic dish in single layer. Spread spice mixture over, cover and set aside at room temperature for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Brush baking dish with oil. Put fish with yogurt and spice coating in baking dish and bake about 15 minutes, until cooked through. Serve garnished with cilantro and lime.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
