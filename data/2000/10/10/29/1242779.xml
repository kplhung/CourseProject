        <p>PARK AND ORCHARD is hardly undiscovered; in the waiting area there is a whole wall of reviews. But it had been some years since The Times last visited, and I was eager to learn for myself what has made this place so successful and maybe bring a fresh point of view to it.</p>
        <p>At first, I thought I'd found a new slant. As of yet, no one has focused on the fact that Park and Orchard is, for all practical purposes, a seafood restaurant. The brothers who own and run the place, Ken and Buddy Gebhardt, buy a huge variety of fresh, top-quality fish. Crawfish, scallops, mussels and clams are listed throughout the entrees, often on pasta. They are all prepared with a gentle hand; fillets of swordfish, mahi-mahi, shrimp and salmon are touted as the house specialty, served  either simply seared (as were the excellent shrimp I tried) or blackened (as was the mahi-mahi, also top-notch), accompanied by a delicate lemon butter sauce.</p>

        <p>PARK AND ORCHARD is hardly undiscovered; in the waiting area there is a whole wall of reviews. But it had been some years since The Times last visited, and I was eager to learn for myself what has made this place so successful and maybe bring a fresh point of view to it.</p>
        <p>At first, I thought I'd found a new slant. As of yet, no one has focused on the fact that Park and Orchard is, for all practical purposes, a seafood restaurant. The brothers who own and run the place, Ken and Buddy Gebhardt, buy a huge variety of fresh, top-quality fish. Crawfish, scallops, mussels and clams are listed throughout the entrees, often on pasta. They are all prepared with a gentle hand; fillets of swordfish, mahi-mahi, shrimp and salmon are touted as the house specialty, served  either simply seared (as were the excellent shrimp I tried) or blackened (as was the mahi-mahi, also top-notch), accompanied by a delicate lemon butter sauce.</p>
        <p>I thought I could also write about how creative the Gebhardts are at combining ingredients, serving dishes that are ''familiar but not the same,'' as Buddy said. Park and Orchard bravely serves many different types of cuisine, but it doesn't lean on the token General Tso's, pizza Margherita or chicken enchilada. Instead, it offers spicy Santa Fe lasagna (with tortillas instead of pasta), chicken meatloaf and even scallops with bananas and nuts. After 22 years (16 in this location), their list of specials is so lengthy that some items must move to the less-prestigious regular menu so as to free up  space for new creations.</p>
        <p>Or there's the wine list -- a book, really. According to Buddy, its primary creator, before he and his brother had their own families to put first, they placed money earned from liquor and wine sales right back into the list. That list helped Park and Orchard garner its 10th Wine Spectator Grand Award, one of 88 restaurants in the world to be named this year.</p>
        <p>But in trying to sort through the nearly 30 food items I sampled -- a mere drop in the ocean of choices here -- the angle suddenly occurred to me. The variety at Park and Orchard can be overwhelming, like deciding which art to view during a stopover in Florence. Without a little guidance, you are likely to have a good -- in fact, a very good -- meal, but perhaps not the best. When I spoke to Buddy after my visits, he said, ''Oh, but there are things -- had  I known you'd been in -- that I would have recommended. We're known for our fire chicken and our crawfish pasta. Everyone loves our spicy food, and I don't think you ordered anything spicy. Next time you come, you must ask what to order.'' Oh. Maybe there should be little stars next to the recommended items on the menu.</p>
        <p>That said, if I were as lucky picking stocks as I was selecting what I ate at Park and Orchard, I'd be rich. You, too, are most likely to do well here, even if choosing can feel like  tossing darts at a list mounted on a wall (it's even hard to choose among metaphors).</p>
        <p>One of my most serendipitous picks was the pirogi, so tender and light it was almost impossible to differentiate between wrapper and  filling. I was told they are handmade by a Polish woman named Stasha,  who doesn't speak any English but ''smiles all day long.'' Tuna carpaccio was refreshing in a different sort  of way: cool, clean and vibrant slices dressed in a thin caper sauce surrounded by baby greens.</p>
        <p>Both the dinner salad and the spinach salad with apples, mushrooms, and hard-boiled eggs were overdressed, irrespective of the dressing selected (there are -- guess what? -- many options). Balsamic vinegar overshadowed the saltiness inherent in the freshly made mozzarella.  Grilled shiitake mushrooms, while tasty and straightforward, seemed lonely without an accompanying  starch.</p>
        <p>Acorn squash, an entree, perfectly showcased Park and Orchard's style. The dish doesn't need to rely on white sugar, as the natural sweetness in dried cranberries, apples, nuts, onions, celery and carrots, when combined with squash, produced a final product that could be served in place of pumpkin pie. Both the chicken and vegetable Mongolian stir-fry and the mixed vegetable Indian stir-fry were fabulous. Park and Orchard doesn't precook its vegetables, so the broccoli here is green and firm and delicious.</p>
        <p>Sides of a puree of butternut squash, carrots, yams, onions, butter, nutmeg and honey and of long-grain brown rice topped with buttery wheatberries accompanied outstanding main courses like the jumbo lump Maryland-style crab cakes, almost entirely juicy meat; the rare seared ostrich with an addictive mushroom and wine dipping sauce; and the delicious scallops a la Ken, cooked in a ceramic dish with onions, tomatoes, butter and lemon.</p>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed all the desserts I sampled. The rich peanut butter pie and the chocolate torte with a pecan crust, which melted into a warm butterscotch puddle, could subdue even the strongest sweet tooth. A chocolate cake coated in chocolate chips was rich enough for four, while the blueberry crumb tart (emphasis on crumb) was hard to keep to myself. But with the exception of the banana cream pie, a mounded slice of whipped cream, pastry cream, bananas, Oreo crumbs, chocolate and a buttery pastry shell, none of the desserts I tried were made in house. I guess I should have tried the brown rice pudding or the maple syrup honey pecan pie, treats I couldn't find anywhere else.  Buddy agreed. Who knew?</p>
