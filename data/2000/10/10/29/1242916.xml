        <p>OPENING his mail several months ago, E. Stanley O'Neal got a real blast from his past. An instructor from graduate school had sent him a card that Harvard Business School professors had used to track Mr. O'Neal's class participation. Affixed to it was a picture of him in full mid-70's flower, with a bushy Afro, long mustache and dark-tinted glasses.</p>
        <p>''Would you want this man running your company?'' said a note attached by the sender.</p>
        <p>That joke elicited a burst of baritone laughter from Mr. O'Neal as he recounted it recently. Weeks earlier, he had been chosen to run the brokerage operations of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, a job generally considered a steppingstone to the chief executive's chair.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't seen that picture in almost 25 years,'' said Mr. O'Neal, now 49 and known to all as Stan. The picture was snapped in a photo booth during a break from work as a foreman at an auto plant outside Atlanta, and Mr. O'Neal took particular note of his factory-issued shirt of ''some unnatural blend'' involving polyester.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. O'Neal looks every bit the polished Wall Street master, starched and trim in pinstriped suits and French-cuffed shirts made of nothing but fine cotton. Typical, except for one essential detail: Mr. O'Neal is an African-American, still a rarity in the executive suites of the biggest investment banks and brokerage firms.</p>
        <p>When Merrill Lynch promoted him in February from chief financial officer to president of what the firm calls its U.S. Private Client Group, he became the first black person ever to run the nation's biggest brokerage business. He is also the first person to hold that job who never worked as a stockbroker, probably is the first who had ever labored in an auto factory, and almost certainly is the first who had picked cotton for spending money as a boy.</p>
        <p>Now, he spends his days in corporate jets and conference rooms, deciding how Merrill's 15,000 brokers should provide financial advice to the millionaires and multimillionaires he says should be Merrill's main target. He took the reins at a crucial time for the brokers, who account for less than half of the firm's profit but who are still considered crown jewels. Merrill and other major brokerage firms are under attack from all manner of new competitors that have much lower costs and can charge less for stock trades and other services delivered mostly electronically.</p>
        <p>The Charles Schwab Corporation, once dismissed on Wall Street as a low-budget discount broker, has swiftly shrunk Merrill's lead as the nation's biggest broker by consistently attracting more new customers and assets than Merrill. To stem the flow of accounts to Schwab and others, Merrill has slashed some prices, cut 2,000 jobs and, belatedly, embraced the Internet.</p>
        <p>After a decade of concentrating on gathering customer assets without keeping a sharp on eye on costs, Merrill is under pressure from shareholders to show that its brokerage business can slim down and become more profitable. That is where Mr. O'Neal, with his background as a financial manager, comes in.</p>
        <p>He has pledged to raise the pretax profit margin of the brokerage unit by three to four percentage points within four years. ''He's got to do that,'' said Richard Strauss, an analyst at the Goldman Sachs Group. ''That's the bare minimum, not a home run.''</p>
        <p>Even then, the business would be keeping, before paying taxes, less than 18 cents of every dollar in revenue. Mr. Strauss said pretax returns from a dominant financial services franchise should be higher than 20 percent, as they are at Schwab and some mutual fund and trust companies.</p>
        <p>If Mr. O'Neal knocks the cover off the ball in his first crack at running one of Merrill's main businesses  solo, he could cinch the chance to succeed David H. Komansky, Merrill's popular chief and chairman. No major firm on Wall Street has ever had a black chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Komansky, the expansive former broker who has been chief since late 1996 and chairman since 1997, is scheduled to retire in 2004. He has promised that by January 2002, he will help the board select a successor to serve as president and C.E.O.-in-waiting for two years. Mr. Komansky has said that there are four or five internal candidates who could succeed him, and speculation within Merrill has focused on Thomas W. Davis, who oversees trading and investment banking; Jeffrey M. Peek, who manages the mutual fund business; and, after his promotion to run the brokerage, Mr. O'Neal.</p>
        <p>The promotion of Mr. O'Neal came as a surprise to most of the brokers he now manages, and even to some other Merrill executives. Most had learned little about him during his first dozen years at the firm -- few knew that his first initial stood for Ernest -- and many had considered him out of contention for a top job after he was selected as chief financial officer in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I've been relatively anonymous for a long time, which has been perfectly fine with me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Outside Merrill, Mr. O'Neal has maintained an even lower profile. He is a director of one charitable organization, the Ronald McDonald House near his Park Avenue apartment in Manhattan, but is not involved with any major service organizations. When the National Urban League, which has tried for years to have Mr. O'Neal join its board, presents an award next month to Merrill Lynch, Mr. Komansky will accept it.</p>
        <p>Hugh B. Price, the league's chief executive, said he still hoped to reel in Mr. O'Neal at some point.</p>
        <p>''His success at Merrill Lynch and on Merrill Lynch's terms is what's of most significance to us as a people,'' Mr. Price said.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neal is off to a fast start. During the summer, he cut 2,000 support jobs in the brokerage division while adding about 500 brokers, and started flattening the hierarchy that had built up over the years. Those and other expense reductions contributed heavily to Merrill's surprisingly strong earnings in the third quarter, which were 53 percent higher than in the third quarter of 1999.</p>
        <p>Still, the contribution from the brokerage operations lags well behind that of Merrill's investment bank. The firm's businesses that cater to corporate and institutional clients earned $3.1 billion before taxes in the first nine months of 2000, about two and a half times as much as the brokerage business earned.</p>
        <p>THE early gains from the brokerage business have added to Mr. Komansky's affinity for Mr. O'Neal. The chairman dismissed the most common criticism of Mr. O'Neal as a leader: that he is too guarded, too tightly wound, that, in short, he is nothing like Mr. Komansky.</p>
        <p>''We both came from fairly atypical backgrounds for where we ended up,'' said Mr. Komansky, a Bronx native whose father was a postal worker. ''Stan didn't have the easiest trip in the world.'' Mr. O'Neal may not be the gregarious back-slapper that he is, Mr. Komansky said, but ''superficial characteristics of a leader are less important than what that person is made of.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neal's journey to Wall Street started in rural eastern Alabama, where his grandfather, who Mr. O'Neal said was born a slave, had settled to raise timber and cotton. He refused to sharecrop on a white man's land and managed to borrow enough money to buy his own, said Mr. O'Neal's father, Ernest O'Neal, who is 70.</p>
        <p>The oldest of four children, Mr. O'Neal was born in 1951, and lived as a child in a house built by his father and uncles. The house had no indoor plumbing, Mr. O'Neal said, and he walked to a one-room schoolhouse. He recalled taking breaks to gather wood for the stove that heated the school.</p>
        <p>His grandmother, mother and aunts picked cotton, and he sometimes worked in the fields alongside them. ''They were not totally unpleasant chores, because I was with my family and I used to listen to all the talk and the gossip,'' he said. ''I didn't like the sense of being poor, though.''</p>
        <p>Ernest O'Neal remembers his oldest son as a quiet boy who read a lot and kept to himself.</p>
        <p>Hard times on the farm drove Ernest O'Neal to move his family to a federal housing project in Atlanta when Stan was 13. In 1964, the father landed a job at the General Motors assembly plant in Doraville, northeast of Atlanta, just as the factory's work force was being integrated.</p>
        <p>An indifferent student in high school, Mr. O'Neal enrolled in the General Motors Institute, a cooperative college run by the automaker in Flint, Mich., after it held an open house at the Georgia factory. He earned a bachelor's degree in industrial administration by taking classes in Michigan for six weeks at a time, then driving the 640 miles back to Atlanta to work in the Doraville plant for six weeks.</p>
        <p>After failing two classes in his second year at G.M.I, now known as Kettering Institute, Mr. O'Neal said he made a concentrated effort to excel. That led him, after a two-year stint as a foreman at Doraville, to the Harvard Business School, where he was an honor student. Upon earning his M.B.A., he joined General Motors' treasury office in New York, a breeding ground for executives. Among his contemporaries was Richard Waggoner, now chief executive of G.M.</p>
        <p>Tony Hain, who taught at G.M.I. and later worked with Mr. O'Neal at G.M., remembered him as being able  to read people and win them over. ''His interpersonal radar is probably as good as anyone I have known,'' said Mr. Hain, now the dean of Kettering's graduate school.</p>
        <p>JOHN FINNEGAN, G.M.'s acting chief financial officer, said that at G.M., ''Stan was a star right away in the office.'' Recalling him as smart and focused, Mr. Finnegan added that he ''seemed to have a great dislike for useless work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neal worked on some of G.M.'s biggest financial deals in the 1980's, including the issuance of tracking stocks for its fast-growing Hughes Electronics and Electronic Data Systems divisions, but he became restless as the company's competitive position sagged. Having come in frequent contact with investment bankers, Mr. O'Neal began to consider making the leap to Wall Street, as had one of his G.M. bosses, Courtney F. Jones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones, who had been treasurer, left in 1985 to be Merrill's chief financial officer and tried to persuade Mr. O'Neal to follow him.</p>
        <p>But Mr. O'Neal had decided that if he was going to Wall Street, he would not go as a financial manager but rather into a job where his contribution could be measured in the only way that counts there: in revenue brought to the firm. Leaving G.M. entailed big career risks and Mr. O'Neal sought a big potential reward, the sort of huge annual bonus that investment bankers took home.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neal considered Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley before deciding in 1987 that he would be more comfortable at Merrill.</p>
        <p>G.M. tried hard to stop him, summoning Mr. O'Neal to its Detroit headquarters for meetings with the chief executive and other officials who told him that he had a bright future at the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neal's wife, Nancy Garvey, an economist who worked with him in the treasurer's office, said her husband labored over the decision long and hard. ''We spent a lot of time talking about it,'' said Ms. Garvey, who went on to be the controller of Allied-Signal, but resigned in 1997 to raise the couple's twins, who are now 9 years old.</p>
        <p>''It was a gutsy move,'' said Robert Scully, a vice chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and a close friend of Mr. O'Neal's. ''On Wall Street, eventually you have to do business, you have to write some tickets.''</p>
        <p>After joining Merrill, Mr. O'Neal made his mark by pushing the firm to be more competitive in the market for high-yield, or junk, bonds. By persuading companies with weak credit ratings to pay hefty fees to Merrill to sell their bonds, Mr. O'Neal led the firm to a top ranking among junk-bond underwriters in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>That success earned him the top job in the junk-bond department and put him on the path to loftier positions. When Herbert M. Allison was appointed to the No. 2 position at Merrill in April 1997, Mr. O'Neal was promoted to be one of his replacements as co-manager of all of the firm's trading and investment banking operations.</p>
        <p>Brian Hehir, a senior Merrill investment banker who then reported to Mr. O'Neal, remembers taking frequent calls from his boss, who always had a list of questions about Mr. Hehir's business. Mr. O'Neal was ''inquisitive'' and ''voracious'' for information, but never imperious, Mr. Hehir said. ''I had a very strong feeling that he had an extreme sense of fairness,'' he said.</p>
        <p>MR. O'NEAL'S ascent since then has been speedy but far from linear. In less than a year, Mr. Komansky persuaded him to become chief financial officer, a role that people at investment banks generally see as thankless, and one that Mr. O'Neal accepted grudgingly. That stint lasted less than two years. But one of them was 1998, a wrenching year for Merrill.</p>
        <p>The firm was rocked by the devastation that the Russian financial crisis wrought on global bond markets. Merrill, which had taken pride in being one of the biggest players in every segment of the bond market, got caught owning a huge amount of bonds whose value sank so fast that they were nearly impossible to unload. Then came the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management, a giant hedge fund that Merrill had to help keep afloat. In October 1998, when its competitors were already rebounding from the chaos of late summer, Merrill reorganized its bond department and laid off 3,400 full-time and 900 part-time employees. The $430 million cost of the revamping caused Merrill to lose $173 million in the third quarter of 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neal had the unpleasant task of delivering the stunningly bad news to investors through conference calls with analysts. Some of them pointed out that as a former head of the capital markets business, Mr. O'Neal had a hand in the buildup that led to the blow-up.</p>
        <p>HOW Mr. O'Neal managed to survive with his reputation intact as a first-rate financial manager remains something of a mystery, some analysts and current and former Merrill employees said. None of them wanted to be identified as critics of a man who may run Merrill someday, and none had a negative word to say about Mr. O'Neal as a person. But they voiced doubts about how he would fare in his first try at running a major line of business by himself.</p>
        <p>Those sentiments do not completely surprise Mr. O'Neal, who says he has often been saddled with low expectations, largely because of his race. Before his latest promotion, he said, when he met people socially and they asked him what he did for a living, he would say he worked at Merrill.</p>
        <p>''And what do you do there?'' they would ask. When he said he was the chief financial officer, he said, there inevitably would be a pause, followed about 75 percent of the time by: ''Of the whole company?''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neal shrugs off such reactions, saying, ''It's not malicious at all, but there's an unspoken expectation that's embedded in that exchange.</p>
        <p>I've been able to find ways of dealing with most of this stuff,'' he continued. ''I've chosen to conduct my career and compete, as much as I could, on ability and performance.''</p>
