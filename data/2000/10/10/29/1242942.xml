        <p>RABAH EL-LOH, 23, stood one afternoon in front of the shallow pit where the body of his brother, Raid, killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers, had just been set down. The funeral had taken all morning and thousands of angry mourners milled around the barren cemetery in Gaza.</p>
        <p>''Goodbye brother,'' he said. ''Say hello to the other martyrs.''</p>
        <p>Gaza is a derelict collection of boxy concrete structures, a slum of about one million people on a flat, dry piece of land about twice the size of Washington D.C. A haze of grit and dust hovers in air fouled by untreated sewage, and the young men, many of whom are unemployed, loiter in groups in the streets.</p>
        <p>Everywhere, the walls of Gaza are plastered with poster-size photographs of those who have died in the recent clashes. Many are pictured holding a weapon in front of the gold-topped Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The odd thing is that these are studio shots, like a bizarre version of a high school yearbook photo, taken long before the current unrest.</p>
        <p>The gun is a prop, the glittering mosque is a large photograph. What was real, apparently, was the desire of these young men to fight against Israel and for a Palestinian state, and to invite death in the process. And now, at least until the pictures fade or peel away, the young men will have their deed recognized.</p>
        <p>The decision by Raid to become a martyr was a conscious one, based, his family said, on despair of life in the Gaza Strip, hatred for Israel and a belief that not to sacrifice himself was to dishonor those who had gone before. ''He spoke only of this, of being a martyr for the last four or five days,'' said his mother, Fatma. ''I asked him not to go. But once his younger brother was wounded, he felt that it was his duty. When he left I said God be with you. I knew he would never come back.''</p>
        <p>In Gaza, those who die fighting Israel are carried on a stretcher through the streets, their bodies covered in Palestinian flags. Impassioned crowds of people swarm around the pallbearers chanting, waving flags and vowing to follow the example of the dead. Bereaved parents sit under white canopies in the blocked-off streets and serve bitter coffee and dates to lines of visitors, including uniformed members of Mr. Arafat's Palestinian police.</p>
        <p>''Tell the man what you want to be,'' said Hyam Temraz to her 2-year-old son Abed, as she peeped out of the slit of a black veil.</p>
        <p>''A martyr,'' the child answered.</p>
        <p>''We were in Jordan when my son Baraa was 4,'' she said. ''He saw a Jordanian soldier and ran and hugged him. He asked him if it was he who would liberate Palestine. He has always told me that he would be a martyr and that one day I would dig his grave.''</p>
        <p>Nezar Rayyan, 42, a theology professor at Islamic University, is a large man with a thick black beard and the quiet gravitas of someone who has spent much of his life reading. On the walls of his office are black and white photographs that illustrate the history of Palestinians over the last five decades. They show lines of trucks carrying refugees from their villages in 1948, after the United Nations formally created Israel and the new state was attacked by its Arab neighbors. They show the hovels of new refugee camps after the 1967 war. And they show the gutted remains of Palestinian villages in what are now Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rayyan's grandfather and great-uncle were killed in the 1948 war. His grandmother died after she and Mr. Rayyan's father were forced from their village near Ashkelon. His father, who eventually settled in the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza, was passed between relatives and grew up with the bitterness of the dispossessed.</p>
        <p>It was a bitterness the father passed on to the son and the son has assiduously passed on to the grandchildren. ''There was not a single night that we did not think and talk about Palestine,'' Mr. Rayyan said, his eyes  moist. ''We were taught that our lives must be devoted to reclaiming our land.''</p>
        <p>MR. RAYYAN spent 12 years in an Israeli jail for his pursuit of that end. His brother-in-law was a suicide bomber who blew up an Israeli bus in 1998. His brother was shot dead by Israelis in street protests seven years ago. Another brother was expelled to Lebanon and several more were wounded in clashes.</p>
        <p>Today, his three sons -- ages 12, 15 and 16 -- daily join the youths who throw rocks at Israeli checkpoints. All, he said, yearn to be one thing -- martyrs for Palestine.</p>
        <p>''I pray only that God will choose them,'' he said.</p>
