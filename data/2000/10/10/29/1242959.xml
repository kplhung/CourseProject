        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article ''In Kingsbridge, a Sycamore Faces an Unwelcome Neighbor'' (Oct. 1), quotes me as saying ''What's all the fuss over a big ugly tree?''</p>
        <p>This quote suggests the opposite of my actual intentions and efforts. I have been an advocate of saving the sycamore throughout the entire development process, having hired an arborist to make recommendations on preserving the tree during the construction period and thereafter. I have designed the building to include an indentation that will accommodate the tree's roots.</p>

        <p>Your article ''In Kingsbridge, a Sycamore Faces an Unwelcome Neighbor'' (Oct. 1), quotes me as saying ''What's all the fuss over a big ugly tree?''</p>
        <p>This quote suggests the opposite of my actual intentions and efforts. I have been an advocate of saving the sycamore throughout the entire development process, having hired an arborist to make recommendations on preserving the tree during the construction period and thereafter. I have designed the building to include an indentation that will accommodate the tree's roots.</p>
        <p>According to the arborist, if his recommendations are followed, which I intend to do, the tree should survive nicely. Although the sycamore is not on my property and legally not my responsibility, I am committed to properly caring for it throughout the construction period and thereafter.</p>
