        <p>HOW does an art museum celebrate Aaron Copland's 100th birthday? By tracing the influences that shaped him and his contemporary visual artists, exploring the milieu in which they created their different, but sometimes complementary, arts.</p>
        <p>At least that's the approach the Heckscher Museum of Art in Huntington takes in ''Aaron Copland's America,'' its ambitious -- and expensive -- exhibition that opens on Saturday. More than 18 months in the making, the show cost $150,000, the most the museum has ever spent. It will be accompanied by concerts, a symposium on Nov. 20, an audio tour guide that features the composer's voice and music along with biographical information and insights into the works on display and instead of the usual catalogue, a book, ''Aaron Copland's America: A Cultural Perspective'' by Gail Levin and Judith Tick (Watson-Guptill Publications, $29.95).</p>
        <p>The exhibition breaks new ground in examining Copland's music and career ''from a sufficiently broad cultural perspective,'' Dr. Levin wrote in the book's introduction.</p>
        <p>So at the same time, in the 1920's, that Copland was incorporating jazz into his works, it also was the subject of paintings. Similiarly, the folk idiom that figures in Copland's music preoccupied visual artists as well, as did the social and political upheavals of their times. The avant-garde in art was reflected in searching for new ways of musical expression. In other words, no creative artists are islands.</p>
        <p>''Copland's remarkable talent developed in synergy with powerful concerns that shaped the times,'' Dr. Levin wrote.</p>
        <p>The project began simply enough when Beth E. Levinthal, currently the interim director of the Heckscher, realized that Copland -- ''a favorite of mine,'' she said, who ''created a definitive American sound in music'' -- would be receiving centennial accolades in 2000. This milestone, Ms. Levinthal suggested, could be the subject for a multidiscipline program linking the visual arts and Copland, who died in 1990.</p>
        <p>Dr. Levin, professor of fine and performing arts and history at Baruch College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, was hired as guest curator and, in turn, brought with her Dr. Tick, a specialist in American music at Northeastern University.</p>
        <p>Initially, the show was proposed as a ''regionalist art exhibition, focusing on America in the 1930's and artists like Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton,'' Dr. Levin said. But it quickly blossomed into a more far-reaching look at American modernism and Copland's life and music.</p>
        <p>''Reading Copland's autobiography, I discovered that at 21 and on his way to study in Paris, Copland met Marcel Duchamp aboard ship,'' Dr. Levin said. ''The artist soon became one of the most important influences in Copland's formative life, introducing him to the Parisian avant-garde, and the scope of the show changed, broadened.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Tick said: ''I knew about the influence literature had on Copland -- he himself acknowledged that. But the influence artists had on him was much less overt, less known, and surprised me.''</p>
        <p>As Dr. Levin and Dr. Tick dug deeper, their search produced some unexpected finds. Dr. Levin was especially pleased with the detective work that eventually linked Copland to Diego Rivera.</p>
        <p>''Rivera never appears in all Copland's writing, in all his papers,'' she explained. ''But this didn't make sense to me since they had many friends and acquaintances in common. I suspect that he expunged Rivera's name because of the trouble he himself had in the McCarthy era and although he, Copland, never joined the Communist Party and said so in public, he wanted to limit his exposure to known Communists.</p>
        <p>''But by studying letters and papers of people they had in common, I'm convinced that they knew each other and that including works by Rivera in the exhibit is justified.''</p>
        <p>Featuring some 120 items -- paintings, works on paper, sculpture, artifacts, photographs and posters from the movies Copland scored -- the show provides a who's who in American art and music during the first six decades of the 20th century. The works are on loan from private collections, museums all over the United States and the Musee Picasso in Paris.</p>
        <p>The cost of shipping the works tripled the show's original budget of $50,000 to fully a tenth of the museum's annual budget of $1.5 million. So the museum began a drive for donations, and while that effort paid off -- with gifts from the Aaron Copland Fund for Music, Ascap, Astoria Federal Savings, Barbash Associates, Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Computer Associates, European American Bank and the federal Department of Education -- not all the expenses have been covered. As a result, the Heckscher is raising admission for this show to $8, $5 for the elderly and $3 for students.</p>
        <p>Some of the influences highlighted in the show are obvious. For example, after seeing ''The Dybbuk'' by S. Ansky in New York and hearing the folk songs used in the play, Copland wrote ''Vitebsk,'' subtitled a ''Study on a Jewish Theme for Violin, Cello and Piano.'' Copland also knew Marc Chagall in Paris and was attracted to his work, even describing a section of ''Vitebsk'' as ''a Chagall-like grotesquerie.''</p>
        <p>Whether Copland actually saw Chagall's ''Green Violinist,'' which is part of the Heckscher show, doesn't matter, Dr. Levin said. ''This violinist was the personification of music to Chagall, and the connection is clear.''</p>
        <p>While the relationships may not be as neatly tied together, there are other shared folk-themed works by Rufino Tamayo, Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, Walker Evans and Charles Sheeler. And even the set sketches and a Shaker rocking chair that Isamu Noguchi created for Martha Graham's ''Appalachian Spring,'' set to Copland's music.</p>
        <p>Copland's preoccupation with jazz is covered in works by Man Ray and Charles Demuth; abstract and avant-garde art is represented by pieces by Duchamp, E. E. Cummings and Salvador Dali. Copland's keen sense of social justice is illustrated with works by Ben Shahn, Marsden Hartley, Daniel Chester French and Raphael Soyer.</p>
        <p>Photographs of Copland by Hans Namuth, Arnold Newman, Gordon Parks, Irving Penn and Ralph Steiner are included, as are photographs and portraits of or by such luminaries who peopled Copland's world as Georgia O'Keeffe, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, Carl Van Vechten and Willem de Kooning.</p>
        <p>Everything adds up, Dr. Tick said, to Copland's respect for ''imagination and the freedom of imagination.''</p>
        <p>''Aaron Copland's America'' runs through Jan. 21 at the Hecksher Museum on Prime Avenue in Huntington. The Copland concert series will begin next Sunday at 3:30 p.m. at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory with Lukas Foss, a friend of the composer, and the Continuum performing ''Copland, the Early Years.''
