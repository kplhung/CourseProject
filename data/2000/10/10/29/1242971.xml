        <p>Said Umar Husseinzoda has large, luminous eyes that never seem to blink, eyes that lock on with the force of tractor beams from the brow of a onetime warrior for God who has turned politician -- and missionary -- for the Islamic Revival Party of Tajikistan.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks he has been out proselytizing, telling the people that the reason the rains did not come to Tajikistan this year, the reason crops have shriveled and meadows and mountains have turned brown as toast is that God is visiting his wrath on the six million Tajiks.</p>
        <p>''God created these hardships and difficulties like a punishment for the people who are not obeying the canons of Islam,'' he said. ''It is a direct punishment from God.''</p>
        <p>It seems a harsh sales pitch for recruiting believers, but as a leading figure in Tajikistan's main religious party, Mr. Husseinzoda presents the face of a new brand of Islamic politics here. The party now has two members in Parliament and more than 50 representatives in local governments, a rarity in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union where Islamic parties are outlawed or suppressed.</p>
        <p>In a region where the threat of Islamic extremism has mobilized military crackdowns and incited alarm in Russia and the West, Mr. Husseinzoda and his party make it apparent that the Islamic revival spreading through Central Asia has many faces.</p>
        <p>The Islamic party that Mr. Husseinzoda represents has joined the secular government of Tajikistan in condemning the Islamic extremism practiced by the Taliban movement in neighboring Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>''War is not the main way for resolving all problems and war is not the best means for creating an Islamic society,'' said Mr. Husseinzoda, a former warrior.</p>
        <p>''God instructed all Muslims that a person should try all peaceful means to explain the goals of Islam to the people and to invite the people to join Islam,'' he said. ''But if someone throws up obstacles to this appeal to the people to join Islam, then this is a reason for war,'' he said, explaining why Muslims in Tajikistan took up arms in their 1992-97 civil war.</p>
        <p>Now that the obstacles to propagating Islam have been removed in Tajikistan, he said, ''we have the possibility to come to power, and that is the big difference between Tajikistan and neighboring countries.''</p>
        <p>Tajiks, however, with their 70-year Soviet indoctrination in secular values, have been slow to embrace Islam, either as a religion or a political ideology. Indeed, a Western diplomat  said that opinion surveys show that the Islamic party is struggling. This proves, the diplomat added, that the ''more repressive the regime'' in Central Asia, ''the more popular Islam,'' and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Here, secularism and the Islamic revival coexist, though Islamic leaders frequently complain that their efforts are thwarted by President Emomali Rakhmonov. And it is difficult at times to separate the goals of Islamic revivalism from those of Islamic extremism.</p>
        <p>''The dream of every Muslim is to live in a society in accordance with the dictates of Islam,'' Mr. Husseinzoda conceded, ''but the main way for the establishment of an Islamic society is the peaceful way.''</p>
        <p>Some who fought alongside the Islamic warriors during Tajikistan's civil war disagree that an Islamic state is even desirable.</p>
        <p>''I was the chief military commander of the opposition during the civil war, and at that time and until now there has never been any discussion of creating an Islamic republic,'' said Hizomov Mirzokhuzha, now a cabinet minister.</p>
        <p>''When I was fighting,'' he continued, ''I was fighting for justice for the citizens, for the women and the children and for no other purpose. Do we believe in God? Of course we believe in God. We are the same as our ancestors, but as for Islam, I probably know more about Marxism and Leninism and so no one could call me an Islamic fundamentalist.''</p>
        <p>Far away from these political and military struggles, there is yet another face of Islam here, that of Hajji Saifudin Najimudinov, who at 62 leads a life devoted to good works, prayer and making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, called the hajj.</p>
        <p>Mr. Najimudinov could be found recently sitting cross-legged on a platform in a village outside Dushanbe at the home of a family in which the father, a teacher, had died. The gathering was a memorial on the 40th day after his death.</p>
        <p>The raised platform, called a kat,  sits under the grape arbors in many courtyards here for communal dining, tea drinking, praying and sleeping, and Mr. Najimudinov was perched there, resplendent his pale blue robe, white beard and turban.</p>
        <p>As the midday sun spackled light through the arbor, the women laid out a feast of meat and rice and the men sat on padded cushions, dipping their hands into the piles of food.</p>
        <p>After leading a prayer from the Koran, one old man who had made the pilgrimage reflected on how militancy had come to define modern Islam. ''They gave me this question when I was on the hajj,'' he said. ''And I asked them whom they were fighting in Afghanistan.'' It seemed his way of pointing out the sin of Muslims fighting Muslims.</p>
        <p>''War is always for power,'' he said. ''Those people fighting for power are not considered Muslims -- all they want is power.'' The other men in the courtyard listened attentively, picking at the grapes, almonds and slices of melon laid before them.</p>
        <p>''It would be better not to waste time talking about this part of history at all,'' the old man said after a long silence. ''Because we will give our grandchildren the sense that we were always at war, and then they will always be at war with each other.''</p>
