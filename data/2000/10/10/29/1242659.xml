      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In its heyday in the late 1800's, Sahuaro Ranch in Glendale, Ariz., nine miles northwest of downtown Phoenix, produced figs, pears, oranges, peaches, apricots and olives. Its owner, William Henry Bartlett, a grain broker from Peoria, Ill., had constructed 15 buildings, mostly of red brick and some quite lavish. He eventually added a rose garden, a golf course and a lily pond with gazebo.</p>
        <p>The ranch, which has been open to the public since 1978, reopened Oct. 13 after an 18-month refurbishment in which the downstairs floor of the main house was replaced and windows were restored. Visitors can tour the main house, which dates to 1895, and see exhibits in the fruit-packing shed. The adobe house that was the first superintendent's home is the visitor center, and the foreman's house is the setting for the museum store.</p>

        <p>In its heyday in the late 1800's, Sahuaro Ranch in Glendale, Ariz., nine miles northwest of downtown Phoenix, produced figs, pears, oranges, peaches, apricots and olives. Its owner, William Henry Bartlett, a grain broker from Peoria, Ill., had constructed 15 buildings, mostly of red brick and some quite lavish. He eventually added a rose garden, a golf course and a lily pond with gazebo.</p>
        <p>The ranch, which has been open to the public since 1978, reopened Oct. 13 after an 18-month refurbishment in which the downstairs floor of the main house was replaced and windows were restored. Visitors can tour the main house, which dates to 1895, and see exhibits in the fruit-packing shed. The adobe house that was the first superintendent's home is the visitor center, and the foreman's house is the setting for the museum store.</p>
        <p>The ranch was used for cotton and sheep farming after Mr. Bartlett sold it in 1913, then, through the middle of the 20th century, as a dairy. The City of Glendale bought 80 acres of the ranch in 1977, and in 1980 the 17-acre parcel containing the ranch buildings was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, with the Sahuaro Ranch Foundation administering the property as a living museum; the remaining 63 acres are now a park.</p>
        <p>The exhibition ''Pioneer Women in Arizona, 1860 to 1912: the Ladies Who Led the Way'' is in the ranch's shed through March 11. Another exhibition, dedicated to the singer Marty Robbins, a Country Music Hall of Fame member and Glendale native son, will run through Thanksgiving weekend in an adjacent gallery.</p>
        <p>Sahuaro Ranch, 9802 North 59th Avenue, Glendale, is open daily. Tours of two of the buildings and the barnyard are offered Wednesday to Sunday for $3. Information: (623) 939-5782, the Glendale Office of Tourism at (623) 930-2957 or tour.glendaleaz.org.</p>
