        <p>BOB SPONG, 60, has been a lobsterman on Long Island Sound all his life. But last March, when he thought the lobster population might never recover, he decided to get what he calls ''the first real job'' he's ever held. So now he drives a forklift at the Home Depot store in Commack on  the lobster shift -- what else? -- from 10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>''The idea was then I could still go fishing during the day,'' Mr. Spong said. He kept his 1,000 lobster traps in the water through the spring. But instead of hauling in 900 lobsters a day, as he and other lobstermen had when the sound was flush, he rarely brought in more than 40 a day, barely enough to pay for the trip.</p>
        <p>''I worried about it for months, but I finally made the decision to take the traps out,'' Mr. Spong said. ''There just wasn't enough signs to stay in.'' He still goes out on his 42-foot boat about once a week to fish for blackfish, but he doesn't expect to make much money from that. He does it just to be out on the water.</p>
        <p>Today, of the 20 lobstermen who used to fish out of Northport, Mr. Spong's home port, only five or six are still fishing for lobster regularly, and many of them have also taken part-time jobs to help make ends meet. Some 7,000 lobster traps sit in neat piles at the foot of the old town dump in Huntington, where town officials have allowed lobstermen to store their unused gear. Mr. Spong checks on his traps every now and then and said that the number of lobstermen bringing in their pots grows each week.</p>
        <p>Further west in the Sound, in Glen Cove to the south and Greenwich to the north, there are virtually no lobsters left and consequently no fishermen either. The situation steadily improves heading eastward, so that at the easternmost tip of the North Fork, fishermen are reporting that things appear almost normal, state officials said.</p>
        <p>So why don't the lobstermen move farther east? The trade has traditionally been very territorial, and a lobsterman who normally fishes out of Glen Cove would not be welcome elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Lobstermen and state officials say the good news is that lobsters do not appear to be dying off, as they had been a year ago, but the bad news is that there are many fewer lobsters being caught and virtually no signs of lobsters in the western sound.</p>
        <p>The causes of the die-off are being studied. Research has implicated a single-celled protozoan, but other factors may be involved.</p>
        <p>Officials in New York and Connecticut do not have statistics showing how hard the lobster industry was hit last year or how the industry is faring now. But officials said that informal surveys of lobsterman suggest that the lobster haul in the central part of the Sound is still off by more than 50 percent and down by about 30 percent as far east as Mattituck.</p>
        <p>''It's a stark difference from the way it had been prior to the die-off when there were record-high harvests,'' said Gordon C. Colvin, the director of marine resources for the New York State Department of Economic Conservation.</p>
        <p>According to the latest figures available from the National Marine Fisheries Service, the lobster industry in New York hit a peak in 1996, with 9.4 million pounds caught, worth nearly $33 million, and stayed strong through 1998, with 8.5 million pounds worth $29.8 million.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, the agency said, 1998 was the peak year, with 3.7 million pounds caught, $12.1 million. Preliminary figures from Connecticut show that in 1999, the haul dropped to 2.5 million pounds, worth about $9.2 million. New York State did not have comparable figures.</p>
        <p>''The only thing that's encouraging is that we have not heard that they're dying in the central sound this fall, and most lobsters seem to be healthy,'' Mr. Colvin said. ''But it's difficult to forecast what might happen, especially in the western sound where there are no young lobsters at all.''</p>
        <p>Lobstermen and officials agree that given the current circumstances, it will take at least four to five years -- the time it takes for young lobsters to grow to one-pound size, the minimum for legal harvesting -- for the lobster industry in Long Island Sound to recover.</p>
        <p>But if what happened to the scallop industry in the Peconic Bay is any indication, the lobstermen have little to look forward to. The scallops there were decimated in 1985 when a sudden bloom of algae known as brown tide starved and killed them. The industry has yet to recover fully. Scallops rebounded briefly in 1994, but another bloom of brown tide hit the following year. And despite years of surveys and research, state officials have been unable to determine what causes brown tide to appear or how to control it.</p>
        <p>It's unclear how many fewer lobster fishermen there are plying the waters this year. The number of licenses issued is down by 20 percent in New York, from 746 in 1999 to only 587 this year, and down by 8 percent in Connecticut, from 419 in 1999 to 386 this year. But officials in both states suspect that many fishermen have kept their licenses but are not actively fishing.</p>
        <p>''The people who have stayed seem to be fishing less gear,'' said Eric M. Smith, the assistant director of marine fisheries for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. ''The number of lobster pots out there has been down.'' Connecticut and New York officials estimated there were more than 500,000 lobster traps in the sound last year, but they will not know how many there are this year until fisherman submit their tallies in December.</p>
        <p>Lobstermen are very close-mouthed about how much they make.  But when Mr. Spong and his friends reminisce about the days of good lobstering, they talk about bringing in 900 to 1,500 pounds a day, which translates, roughly, to $3,000 to $5,000.</p>
        <p>''It was a tough but nice way to earn a living,'' said Larry Eberhardt, a good friend of Mr. Spong's who now works at Home Depot, too. He said the months of April and May would be busy, followed by a slow June when lobsters shed their shells, and then followed by two or three busy months. ''The rest of the time, you could vacation when you wanted and if you didn't feel like going out one day, you just didn't,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Marcel Cormier, one of the few fishermen still tending lobster traps out of Northport, estimated that his lobstering income this year would drop by 90 percent. There have been days when he has checked 400 of his 1,000 traps, only to come back with only 30 lobsters. The only way for a lobsterman to survive this year, he said, is ''to have a wife with a good job.'' (His wife, Susan, is a jeweler in Northport.)</p>
        <p>With last year's catastrophic die-off in the western sound, the federal government has approved $3.6 million to compensate lobstermen in New York for their losses and another $3.6 million for Connecticut lobstermen, but the money has yet to be distributed, and state officials do not know how much longer it will take.</p>
        <p>Officials from both states also are preparing to divide up $6.6 million in federal research dollars to study causes of the lobster deaths. A research team at the University of Connecticut found last November that a parasite had killed the lobsters but has been awaiting further financing for research to determine what might have weakened the lobsters' immune systems enough to make them susceptible to the parasite. The parasite in question is a paramoeba, a tiny, one-celled protozoan that targets the lobster's nervous system and destroys nerve tissue.</p>
        <p>Many lobstermen have a different view. Blaming the die-off on last year's pesticide spraying to kill mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus, about 1,100 lobsterman from Long Island Sound have filed a lawsuit against five pesticide manufacturers, seeking $125 million in damages. But researchers have been skeptical of the pesticide theory, noting that while the lobster die-off peaked last fall, it began last summer, before pesticide spraying began.</p>
        <p>Other possible causes include last year's unusually warm water temperatures, which were generated by tropical storms that moved through the area and brought in large amounts of warm freshwater, the large lobster populations in previous years may have made it possible for a disease to spread rapidly.</p>
        <p>The State University of New York at Stony Brook recently received $1 million in state money to create a pathology laboratory so lobsters will no longer have to be shipped to Connecticut, Virginia and Arizona for autopsies.</p>
        <p>Jack Mattice, the director of the New York Sea Grant program, which will coordinate the research with Connecticut Sea Grant and other agencies from both states, said that because there were likely multiple causes for the die-off, the federally financed research would try to cover all possibilities. The research money also will be used to study the causes of shell disease, which has struck mainly in the waters off of Montauk and Fishers Island. Shell disease does not kill lobsters but leaves their shells eroded and pitted, making them unappealing at the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mattice also said that some of the research money would be used to pay lobstermen to set traps to bring in a sampling of lobsters for study.</p>
        <p>But for older fishermen like Mr. Spong, the fruits of the research may come too late.</p>
        <p>''The lobsters won't be back in my lifetime,'' Mr. Spong said with resignation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spong and his friend Mr. Eberhardt often scour the ads in magazines for commercial fishermen, looking for a boat with a license for offshore lobster fishing. But these bigger, more powerful boats cost $400,000 to $500,000, significantly more than the $50,000 to $150,000 that a fisherman in the sound normally spends for a boat.</p>
        <p>''We dream,'' Mr. Spong said, ''but we don't know if we have what it takes at this stage of the game. Offshore fishing is a young man's game, because you're far out there, and you've got to fight the sea.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eberhardt said he often wonders what to call himself these days, considering that he spends 40 hours a week moving stock at Home Depot.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what I'm supposed to be anymore,'' he said. '' Am I still a fisherman? I don't know. I never thought I'd have to start new at age 53, but I guess that's life.''</p>
