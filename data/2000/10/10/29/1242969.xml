        <p>The graceful dark shadow that haunted my Subway Series was the real and imagined memory of our most glamorous and mysterious ballplayer, Joe DiMaggio. Back when the outfield was our frontier, the Yankee Clipper was our gunfighter, a quick and wary gazelle of a man who drifted so smoothly over the stadium grass and through the neon nights that he seemed the quintessence of competency and cool. Mickey Mantle never replaced DiMaggio for me -- alas, I got to know the Mick -- and Reggie Jackson was no enigma, and David Justice, Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill seem like superb ballplayers and fine men, which is not the fantasy I have in mind.</p>
        <p>DiMaggio's hold on those of us who saw him play has always been puzzling. It must be about memory and projection and need. His need as well as ours. While DiMaggio was as personally elusive and professionally elegant as Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky -- and won more championships than either -- he was never as singularly dominating a figure within his sport. Yet he will probably live longer in legend. Was it the times, was it the Yankees and their mythmakers, was it the vulnerability he showed after Marilyn Monroe dumped him, was it the Mr. Coffee commercials, was it his icy brilliance at curating his own exhibit in the museum of American culture?</p>

        <p>The graceful dark shadow that haunted my Subway Series was the real and imagined memory of our most glamorous and mysterious ballplayer, Joe DiMaggio. Back when the outfield was our frontier, the Yankee Clipper was our gunfighter, a quick and wary gazelle of a man who drifted so smoothly over the stadium grass and through the neon nights that he seemed the quintessence of competency and cool. Mickey Mantle never replaced DiMaggio for me -- alas, I got to know the Mick -- and Reggie Jackson was no enigma, and David Justice, Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill seem like superb ballplayers and fine men, which is not the fantasy I have in mind.</p>
        <p>DiMaggio's hold on those of us who saw him play has always been puzzling. It must be about memory and projection and need. His need as well as ours. While DiMaggio was as personally elusive and professionally elegant as Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky -- and won more championships than either -- he was never as singularly dominating a figure within his sport. Yet he will probably live longer in legend. Was it the times, was it the Yankees and their mythmakers, was it the vulnerability he showed after Marilyn Monroe dumped him, was it the Mr. Coffee commercials, was it his icy brilliance at curating his own exhibit in the museum of American culture?</p>
        <p>If we are closer to an answer, it is thanks to Richard Ben Cramer's ''Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life,'' the most absorbing and readable sports biography in recent memory, as well as the most credibly demystifying and, eventually, the most disagreeable. I read it between games last week. By excavating around the man, Cramer manages the stunning feat of giving us the information we need about a simple hero encrypted in a complex fandom to let us make our own prejudiced decisions. But it is hard not to come away with the feeling that there was less there than met the eye, that Joe was the shell and we are still the stuffing.</p>
        <p>What we know: he was a courtly, traditional Sicilian gentleman and he was a small-minded, abusive pig, and he was a model for the modern ballplayer. He was obsessed with his image and his stardom, greedy for money and glory, insensitive to teammates and fans, disengaged from the life around him. He was selfish; by calling late for a fly ball, only when he was sure he had an easy catch, he caused Mantle to ruin his leg forever. There was some touch of the idiot savant about DiMaggio; he had a genius for the game and little else besides making money -- which was a form of scoring -- since he was too cheap to enjoy the dough.</p>
        <p>Once, in St. Petersburg, Fla., he charmed me breathless with an impromptu soliloquy about an outfielder's sky. Twenty years later, he bored me silly during a two-hour sit-down TV interview. When asked, I would tell people that I liked Joe, that he was dignified, earnest, not very smart, that sometimes still waters ran shallow. Yet after reading Cramer's book, I wondered if Monroe could have been right when she said he had a ''sufficiency in himself that made him quiet at his core.''</p>
        <p>His pride was a moral force on his ballclub. How could you not slide hard into a second baseman, run out a grounder, work on your mechanics, when the Big Guy never let up, even when bones were digging into the flesh of his heels, when his temperature was 103 degrees? The Clipper would have gotten along with Joe Torre, who would have known how to stroke him; appreciated Derek Jeter, while resenting the attention he gets; probably thought O'Neill's intensity admirable although self-indulgent, and rightly concluded that Roger Clemens had a Hall of Fame arm and a busher's soul.</p>
        <p>But where would DiMadge have gone after the game? To a back table at Toots Shor's where Jimmy Cannon, a prince of the press that protected him, would have done all the talking? Back to Newark, where Richie the Boot would have cobbled together a testimonial dinner after which gangsters would ''contribute'' to Joe's untaxed account in the Bowery Bank? To a hotel room where one of his bobos, Peanuts or Georgie Solotaire, would have brought a chorus girl for Joltin' Joe's pleasure?</p>
        <p>The book turns sour along with Joe, in his later years. Early on, even when dealing with many-told tales, Cramer is fresh. Through the prism of Joe's struggle for perfection, Cramer's baseball action, especially during the Streak, is exciting. The Marilyn chapters are restrained, yet move the story forward. But Cramer's eye for detail and character becomes chilly when DiMaggio's energy is directed toward making money without giving away any more than his signature and remote presence. He was good at that, too, if not the Mozart or Michelangelo he had been with bat and glove. After the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, DiMaggio walked out of his house with a garbage bag filled with $600,000 in cash.</p>
        <p>He was as motivated by mean spirit as by greed, demanding extra to sign a photo of himself and Ted Williams because he had never forgiven the Kid for making a higher salary than he did. As octogenarians, Ted came into his own as an icon, war hero and independent soul, while Joe emerged, because of card shows, as one of the best-paid major leaguers, never alone, yet solitary.</p>
        <p>Maybe Joe won, after all. He died with uncounted money. He would have hated our pity, would not have cared if we felt disappointed. Luckily, the season is over. And I'll always have St. Petersburg.</p>
