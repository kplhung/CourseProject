        <p>IT may be the prettiest restaurant I've ever seen; certainly it's in the top five. Yacout, behind high walls in Marrakesh's ancient medina, is set in a ravishing small 17th- and 18th-century palace, its various rooms in early January glowing with crackling fires in the fireplaces, lighted by ornate filigree and colored-glass fixtures, its walls miracles of colorful tilework. Waiters in long white caftans moved silently about, and from the roof terrace one could look out over the old quarter, or back to the inner courtyard and its pool.</p>
        <p>I can't testify to the food, because to our regret we hadn't reserved days ahead, and it was New Year's week; the city was full of visitors.

        <p>IT may be the prettiest restaurant I've ever seen; certainly it's in the top five. Yacout, behind high walls in Marrakesh's ancient medina, is set in a ravishing small 17th- and 18th-century palace, its various rooms in early January glowing with crackling fires in the fireplaces, lighted by ornate filigree and colored-glass fixtures, its walls miracles of colorful tilework. Waiters in long white caftans moved silently about, and from the roof terrace one could look out over the old quarter, or back to the inner courtyard and its pool.</p>
        <p>I can't testify to the food, because to our regret we hadn't reserved days ahead, and it was New Year's week; the city was full of visitors. But we were cordially allowed to walk through the restaurant before dinner, and we noted the quietly splashing fountain in the entry, the pool in the courtyard and the fresh rose petals scattered on the tablecloths, muttering to ourselves about ''next time.''</p>
        <p>Three of us -- my husband, Michael, my brother Fen and I -- were in Morocco for 10 days in December and early January. It was the end of Ramadan, so the city was quiet during the day, despite holiday visitors, and came alive at night, when the renowned square, Jemaa el Fna, was transformed into a theatrical scene of food stalls where busy cooks worked at charcoal grills, Berber storytellers regaled their Moroccan audiences and snake charmers sat on the ground surrounded by the curious.</p>
        <p>Our trip started in Marrakesh; we then made the spectacular four-and-a-half-hour  drive south in a rented car over the Atlas Mountains to Ouarzazate and the picturesque Valley of the Draa, afterward flying from Ouarzazate to Fez, our final stop.</p>
        <p>Throughout the trip, we were struck by the perfect winter climate -- 60 to 65 degrees in the daytime, cool at night -- and the remarkably preserved Moroccan culture, seemingly untouched by modern mores or mall blight.</p>
        <p>And everywhere, we reveled in the beauty of Moroccan architecture, and the fact that in the old quarters of Marrakesh and Fez, grand houses and small palaces are being converted into wonderfully beautiful restaurants, small hotels or B &amp; B's. Here, the Arabian Nights fantasy is based in reality. Time and again, whether at a museum, a historic monument, a restaurant or small hotel in the old quarter, you would step out of a dusty, hectic street into a cool hallway leading to a courtyard with a fountain or a small garden, surrounded by white walls  brilliant with patterned tile or pierced with improbably delicate windows.</p>
        <p>When Morocco was a French protectorate (from 1912 to 1956), the colonial government maintained an active program of historic preservation. But we were impressed that now so many individual owners or entrepreneurs, some of them Moroccan, were restoring and converting buildings in the old sections, rather than in the neighborhoods established by Europeans.</p>
        <p>Of course, the country has long had its legendary grand hostelries, the Mamounia in Marrakesh, the Gazelle d'Or near Taroudant and the Palais Jamai in Fez. A luxury resort opened this spring 20 minutes outside Marrakesh, the vast and stunning Amanjena (part of the Amanresorts group); we were able to walk through as it was close to completion. But what we found most exciting were the renovations or reinterpretations of old Moroccan buildings that have been carried out in or near the medinas.</p>
        <p>One of the pleasures, and sometimes frustrations, of finding a restaurant in the medinas of Fez or Marrakesh was making our way on foot or being let off by a taxi in a dusty, dim street in front of an unpromising high blank wall. But then either a large door would quietly open, or a robed attendant would appear, to lead us through the entrance. Invariably, we were in another magical interior.</p>
        <p>This is the delightful game of inside-outside that plays out in the old quarters of Morocco, where you go from the sunny, noisy hustle of the souk or a dusty roadway into the shadowy coolness of hallways of tile or filigreed stucco. In the many palace museums, long sequences of rooms are  punctuated by small interior gardens.</p>
        <p>Our introduction came at our hotel, the Villa des Orangers, which opened the week we arrived. We felt as dubious as our cabdriver about 6, rue Sidi Mimoun. Although it was farther down the same broad avenue as the Mamounia, inside the old city walls but outside the teeming souk, No. 6 was next to a derelict building and we couldn't see a sign. We eventually made out a small door, walked down the narrow entrance hall, and -- the Moroccan surprise.</p>
        <p>Just behind the concierge desk, where we were warmly greeted, we peered into an enchanting courtyard with four small orange trees and a quietly dripping fountain. It was framed at ground and second floors by delicate columns supporting arcades of lacy white carved stucco and gleaming 12-foot-high cedarwood doors.</p>
        <p>The 1930's mansion with two courtyards was converted and restored by a French couple, Pascal and Veronique Beherec, with great attention to detail. We had some small quibbles -- our split-level ground-floor rooms were not as appealing as the second-floor rooms we saw later, some with tiny terraces adjacent to the small swimming pool on the roof (although our bathroom was immense); only breakfast and beverages were available (now guests can order light lunches and a set-menu dinner). But the warm, attentive staff, the delicious Moroccan crepes and fresh orange juice for breakfast, and the delicate beauty and tranquillity of our surroundings soon had us congratulating ourselves on our good fortune.</p>
        <p>To celebrate New Year's Eve, we went to a restaurant in the medina, Le Tobsil, opened a year and a half ago in a lovely renovated house. The reveillon dinner was a festive feast, starting with a delicate fish pastilla (layers of flaky pastry with filling), then chicken with olives, boned stuffed pigeon, or whole fish stuffed with semolina and raisins, all accompanied by pleasant Moroccan red wine (French diners were having Champagne). Tables were artfully placed around the open candlelighted courtyard spread with bright rugs. At the stroke of the millennium midnight, Gnaouas musicians, from southern Morocco, in white robes burst in with songs and powerful drumming.</p>
        <p>Although Le Marocain, the Moroccan restaurant in the Mamounia, was created by European architects in 1922, it has exotic mood to spare. Despite hearing almost exclusively American voices as we crossed the hotel's vast lobby, we fell under a  spell in the rose-pink aura of this period piece restaurant. Here the belly dancer seemed to belong, as we watched her from our comfy divans.</p>
        <p>WHILE we were starting to get used to dining in exquisiteness, when our hotel proprietor told us about Al Fassia, a restaurant in Gueliz, the new section of the city that was built by the French, we jumped. Gueliz is unexciting but modern on a walkable, human scale, and Al Fassia's interior, while pleasant, does not have the allure of the old city. However, here one can order a la carte.</p>
        <p>After a few days we realized that Moroccan cuisine, superb when well prepared, is traditionally served in a set series of courses. Meaning that meals tended to be long, rich and stately -- splendid, but not every night. At Al Fassia, where we ate twice, we could limit ourselves to spicy traditional harira (chickpea and lentil soup) followed by salades marocaines, the first course of a selection of cold salads -- here there were 15 delicious choices. And, we discovered, Al Fassia is an all-women operation. It was the only restaurant we encountered where the servers were not male, and these women, in charming regional dress, radiated graciousness and efficiency.</p>
        <p>During the day, we would snack or find a cafe. And, always avid for interiors, we compulsively roamed  the old city. We had heard from friends of an original spirit in the medina, Meryanne Loum-Martin, who had converted a grand house into Ryad Tamsna. After our usual arduous search (Ryad Tamsna, too,  has no sign), we had a delightful lunch and heard Ms. Loum-Martin recount how she came to Marrakesh 10 years ago and fell in love with the city. Her outpost is an unusual combination boutique, bookstore, art gallery and restaurant (for brunch, lunch or tea; reservation only). The small boutique has a choice selection of jewelry, fabrics and home accessories.</p>
        <p>Another afternoon, we took a taxi to the far side of the medina to the Maison Arabe, once a legendary restaurant, now reopened as an enchanting small hotel (its restaurant opened after we visited). If one were 6 feet 4, one might hesitate to stay here because this jewel box is done to a rather Lilliputian scale. The feeling is of delicious cosseting: warm carpets, deep divans and a small flower-edged courtyard. The two rooms we looked at were cozy and inviting, one with a minuscule terrace; each of the 10 rooms and suites, we were told, is different.</p>
        <p>On foot in the medina again, the three of us feeling exasperated after several dead ends, we eventually found the Dar al Assad, and looked around this quiet B &amp; B, with three rooms handsomely decorated with Moroccan pieces and area rugs -- and the requisite charming courtyard. Its prices were also more reasonable than the upper-level ones we had encountered so far. The inn is now reportedly being sold. Several other B &amp; B's in a similar spirit have opened in the medina in the last few years.</p>
        <p>The strongest evocations of the poetry of Moroccan interiors and long-ago life at the top can be had at the city's great sites: the superb 16th-century Saadian tombs, set in a jumbled garden full of birds; the haunting ruined El Badi Palace of the same era, with its vast empty pools and storks perched on the high exterior walls, or the 19th-century Bahia Palace. There, an endless sequence of empty rooms and small hidden gardens leads into a vast tiled courtyard, the whole built for a black slave who became a powerful vizier.</p>
        <p>Although most mosques cannot be visited by non-Muslims in Morocco, there are intriguing courtyard glimpses to be had. Next to the mosque of the same name is the Ibn  Youssef Medersa (which can be visited), built in the 14th and 16th centuries to house religious students; its courtyard of delicate stucco, tiles and carved wood is a revelation of craftsmanship, work so fine it resembles old lace. Two splendid palace museums in the medina also have storybook settings: the Dar Si Said Museum and the recently opened Musee de Marrakech. The latter had one small but fine display of objects from Moroccan synagogues, now sadly almost vanished from the country.</p>
        <p>At about the surfeit point for this kind of opulence, we left Marrakesh and drove over the slightly dizzying  mountain road (good highway, no guard rails) to Ouarzazate. Long a separate culture when the mountains formed an almost impregnable barrier, this Berber region recalls the sweep of the American Southwest. Even more powerfully, it recalls scenes from the Bible. On the most remote and barren reaches, robed shepherds stood guarding their flocks of goats or sheep. Mysterious mud-walled casbahs, or fortress villages, loomed from distant hilltops.</p>
        <p>A few days were not enough to see the picturesque countryside around Ouarzazate, a rather charmless town with several comfortable chain hotels. But driving south toward the Sahara as far as Zagora gave us a powerful sense of the Berber lands: harsh near-desert, then rich green date-palm groves stretching the length of the Draa Valley.</p>
        <p>IT was a perfect contrast to Fez, the Moroccan city whose old quarter, Fez el Bali, seems most unchanged by modern intrusions (and where the aggressive guides and hustlers are deeply trying to Western tourists). Here we stayed at the wonderful Palais Jamai, a 19th-century palace (its rooms are now suites) whose larger section was added in 1930 and refurbished in 1998-99.</p>
        <p>Ornate tiles, high ceilings and knowing decoration create a cool, gracious atmosphere. Most rooms overlook the superb garden with a pool and fountains, and beyond them the medina. Our attractive sixth-floor room with a 30's feel had a semi-enclosed balcony. Sitting there as night fell, looking out over the medina, watching the lights go on and hearing the muezzins' call to prayer, is a lasting memory of Fez.</p>
        <p>Like the Mamounia, the Palais Jamai has a Moroccan restaurant with  full-fledged fantasy decor, but our favorite discovery was the Maison Bleue. We went for the food, and it was the best we had in Morocco. But the decor, too, was astonishingly lovely in this small 1915 palace in the medina. The home of the el-Abbadi family, who still own it, it became a restaurant a few years ago, and more recently, guest suites were created upstairs. We were greeted in the rather bleak hallway by a djellaba- clad attendant who preceded us into the enclosed courtyard restaurant ringing a small bell -- no doubt the closest the three of us will ever come to making a royal entrance.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by vertiginous white walls pierced with lacy windows and enormous cedar doors, and entertained by a terrific three-man orchestra playing trance-inducing southern Moroccan music, we sat back on cushioned divans and were regaled with a superb array of first-course salads, then tagines, one specially prepared for the vegetarian in our group. I tried to memorize the taste and texture of the fabulous dessert, called Jouhara -- a delicate concoction of crackling superthin  pastry and creme patissiere flavored with orange water and cinnamon so ethereal it was like eating cloud.</p>
        <p>After dinner, a manager showed us the one unoccupied suite upstairs. The charmingly eccentric space had very high ceilings, attractive Moroccan furnishings (marred somewhat by banal contemporary paintings) and a stunning tile floor.</p>
        <p>We could picture ourselves being happy here.</p>
        <p>Finding the right doors to knock on</p>
