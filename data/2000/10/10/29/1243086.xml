        <p>Ten moments that define the Yankees' current dynasty, ranked in order by The Times's Buster Olney.</p>
        <p>1. Oct. 23, 1996 -- Leading the Series by two games to one, Atlanta takes a 6-0 lead in the fifth inning of Game 4. But after the Yankees score three runs in the sixth, Jim Leyritz hammers a hanging slider from Mark Wohlers for a game-tying three-run homer; the Yankees score twice in the 10th to win, 8-6.</p>
        <p>2. Oct. 10, 1998 -- The Yankees are trailing Cleveland in the A.L. Championship Series, two games to one, and Manager Joe Torre has no idea what to expect from Cuban defector Orlando Hernandez, who is making his first postseason appearance, in the cold. The Yankees lead, 3-0, in the sixth, but Cleveland starts to stir, putting a couple of runners on base -- until El Duque strikes out Manny Ramirez and Jim Thome in order.</p>
        <p>3. Aug. 5, 1998 -- With the Yankees trailing, 5-1, in the second game of a doubleheader in Oakland, Darryl Strawberry blasts a stunning pinch-hit grand slam, and the Yankees go on to win, 10-5. It was the perfect microcosm of their 114-victory dominance that season.</p>
        <p>4. Oct. 21, 2000 -- The Yankees trail the Mets, 3-2, in the bottom of the ninth of Game 1 when 37-year-old Paul O'Neill, who has been slumping for more than a month, faces Armando Benitez, the closer with the meteoric fastball. O'Neill, overmatched, battles Benitez to a full count and fouls off four two-strike pitches before drawing a walk. He goes on to score the tying run, and the Yankees win in the 12th inning.</p>
        <p>5. Oct. 22, 1996 -- Outscored in the first two games of the Series by, 16-1, the Yankees lead, 2-0, in the sixth of Game 3. Atlanta loads the bases with nobody out. Joe Torre goes to the mound and tells David Cone to be honest about his condition. ''I still lied, I told him I had something left,'' Cone said. He pitches out of the jam with the lead intact, keeping the Yankees alive.</p>
        <p>6. Oct. 8, 2000 -- Exhausted from an overnight flight, the Yankees struggle desperately to hold an early 6-0 lead against Oakland in the deciding game of their division series. Mike Stanton, who usually pitches in the seventh or eighth, enters the game in the fourth, restores order and pitches two scoreless innings, and the Yankees hold on, 7-5.</p>
        <p>7. Sept. 14, 1999 -- Toronto leads the slumping Yankees, 6-1, in the eighth, when Ricky Ledee avoids a tag and scrambles to second base to keep the inning going with two outs. More runners reach base, and Bernie Williams ties the game with a grand slam. Paul O'Neill hits a grand slam in the ninth for a 10-6 victory -- and the Yankees streak into the postseason.</p>
        <p>8. Oct. 14, 1999 -- In Game 2 of a tense American League Championship Series against Boston, the Yankees lead, 3-2, in the eighth inning, when the Red Sox load the bases with one out. Ramiro Mendoza is summoned from the bullpen and strikes out Butch Huskey, before Jose Offerman flies to center field to end the rally, and the Yankees hang on.</p>
        <p>9. Oct. 24, 1996 -- In Game 5 of the World Series, the Yankees are clinging to a fragile 1-0 lead in the ninth inning, after John Wetteland relieved Andy Pettitte. With runners at first and third and two outs, pinch-hitter Luis Polonia fouls off six straight fastballs. Then Yankee Coach Jose Cardenal shifts Paul O'Neill about eight feet to his right, and when Polonia lines a ball to right-center, O'Neill, playing with a sore hamstring, catches the ball with a lunge, ending the game.</p>
        <p>10. Oct. 20, 1998 -- After winning the first two games of the World Series, the Yankees are losing to the Padres, 3-2, in the eighth inning, and San Diego's All-Star closer Trevor Hoffman enters to hold the lead. But Scott Brosius smashes a three-run homer over the center-field wall, raising both arms in joy when the ball disappears over the fence.</p>
