        <p>In the early 1960's, when Dr. Gerald W. Deas was an intern in the obstetrics clinic at Kings County Hospital, he discovered that many black women he treated ate an unusual snack: cubes of laundry starch. The practice was believed to be a holdover from women who ate clay in Africa, but Dr. Deas quickly found that the ingested starch often caused anemia because it interfered with the body's ability to produce iron.</p>
        <p>Getting black women to stop eating starch became a seven-year crusade for the young doctor, one that proved successful and brought him national attention. In the three decades since, Dr. Deas (pronounced Dees) centered his practice of medicine in a smaller, but very appreciative arena: Jamaica, Queens.</p>
        <p>Residents and colleagues point to his house calls and his teaching, writings and broadcasts that promote public health. In essence, he became a sort of country doctor in the city, although one with a penchant for urban poetry, music and playwriting.</p>
        <p>But even dynamos slow down. Two years ago, Dr. Deas closed the private practice he had run from the basement of his home in Hollis. And last week, at 69, he retired as an internist at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he had worked for 35 years.</p>
        <p>The community he has treated, though, will not let him go quietly, if at all.</p>
        <p>''He is not really leaving,'' said Jean Phelps, president of the Jamaica branch of the N.A.A.C.P. ''He is family. Although he might be leaving Jamaica Hospital, he's still going to be around the community. He's everybody's doctor in Queens.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Deas became ''everybody's doctor'' after his seven-year campaign against Argo starch -- the only company to make laundry starch in an edible form. Eating the starch was a substitute for eating clay, which for generations was considered a delicacy among blacks and some whites in the South. As time passed, black women -- especially those in the North -- started eating starch because it was easier to come by and had the same gritty texture. ''It's not a strange phenomenon,'' Dr. Deas said. ''It's an oral satisfaction.''</p>
        <p>To educate the black women about the dangerous effects of ingesting starch, he designed and distributed pamphlets, wrote columns in The Amsterdam News, appeared on local radio programs and, on television, filmed 23 segments for ''The McCreary Report.''</p>
        <p>''Every place you would go, black women were eating laundry starch,'' said Dr. Deas, who added that articles about the habit had appeared in medical journals for 75 years. ''Nobody attacked the company; all they did was write about the strange behavior of black women. I attacked the company.''</p>
        <p>In 1977, Best Foods, which owned Argo starch, began warning on its label that the product was unfit to eat. The company also started making the starch in powdered form, not as appealing as the cubes. Today the problem is virtually nonexistent.</p>
        <p>In 1985, the Food and Drug Administration gave Dr. Deas a special award for his efforts..</p>
        <p>Dr. Deas, who grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, said that when he went into medicine in the 1960's, he wanted to be like an old-fashioned country doctor -- to create a one-stop treatment shop for all ailments. He divided his residency training between general medicine and various specialties that would allow him to establish a family practice.</p>
        <p>And throughout his career, he never stopped making house calls.</p>
        <p>''You become part of the family,'' he said. ''You're not just a doctor anymore. You go to the funerals, too, and the weddings.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Deas has been family to Martinia Hudgins, who is 95, for more than 30 years. When Ms. Hudgins's mother was bedridden, he took care of her. Now, Ms. Hudgins is confined to bed with a broken hip.</p>
        <p>Dr. Deas ''is more than special,'' she said. ''If I need him I'm going to call him, and he'll be right there.''</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Deas has promised his wife, Beverly, that he will cut down on the number of house calls he makes, there are patients like Ms. Hudgins and the jazz bassist Milt Hinton, whom he said he will continue to look after.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Gerry is ever going to retire, because he just has that type of spirit where he likes to get involved with people,'' his wife said. ''To totally retire and just be doing things for self would not be like Gerry. It's a wonderful asset to have, although it can be kind of wearing on him as a person.''</p>
        <p>To Melvin Douglass, a professor of sociology and history at the College of New Rochelle, Dr. Deas is an inspiration. ''You don't find many people with Dr. Deas's background staying in the community,'' said Dr. Douglass, who was a patient and protege of Dr. Deas. ''He represents the old school for me. He's probably the last vestige of renaissance scholars out there.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Deas wears a baseball cap that says he is a left-brained logical thinker. Butcreativity does not escape him.</p>
        <p>''Oh! Oh! Obesity,'' a musical he wrote about the trials of being overweight, is scheduled to be revived at a community theater in Jamaica next year. Dr. Deas also writes songs. In 1969, he penned ''A Black Child Who Can't Smile,'' a song about sickle-cell anemia that was recorded by the rhythm and blues singer Brook Benton and used by the March of Dimes.</p>
        <p>His writing also extends to social issues. In a poem called ''Felon Sneakers,'' Dr. Deas addresses young African-American males:</p>
        <p>When our unfortunate black brothers go to jail,</p>
        <p>The law-man ties up their feet.</p>
        <p>He makes them wear felon sneakers,</p>
        <p>With laces that cannot meet. . .</p>
        <p>So tighten up on your sneakers,</p>
        <p>Put a goal right in your mind,</p>
        <p>Put your nose to that grindstone,</p>
        <p>And success in life, you will find.</p>
        <p>While Dr. Deas will no longer make rounds at Jamaica Hospital, he is not quite ready for a life of leisure. He will continue as an instructor at the State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine and as director of its health education committee. He also writes a health column in The Amsterdam News.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to use that doctor's bag anymore,'' he said. ''I'm just retiring my bag, not my brain.''</p>
