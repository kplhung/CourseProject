The bride, whose academic specialty is the history and philosophy of science, was on a Fulbright scholarship, researching a book on 19th-century British philosophy of science. The bridegroom, who specializes in political philosophy, was an Italian National Council for Research fellow, completing a book on contemporary British and American political thought.</p>
