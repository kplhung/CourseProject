        <p>THE view is terrific, even if it's from the top of a massive trash heap. The wide swath of the Hudson River and the breathtaking skyline of Manhattan are to the east, and the rolling hills of northern New Jersey march north and west.</p>
        <p>If current plans are carried out, this moonscape of construction debris and industrial waste rising from the watery flats known as the Meadowlands will be covered in grassland and bushes and become the home to as many as four golf courses. The project, which would  involve more than 900 acres, would be one of the largest reuses in the state of a brownfield, the term for land that has been environmentally contaminated and often abandoned as a result.</p>
        <p>Brownfield redevelopment is taking place all over New Jersey, a state whose industrial history has left it with an abundance of contaminated land. Real estate executives say intense demand for sites for retail, commercial and recreational activities -- along with a more realistic attitude on the part of state lawmakers and regulators -- is pushing developers to consider places they would have avoided in the past.</p>
        <p>''Brownfields are becoming a major force in the real estate market,'' said Ira L. Whitman, who heads an environmental consulting company in East Brunswick. He noted that more than 3,000 people attended a recent conference in Atlantic City just to discuss brownfield issues.</p>
        <p>''The demand for industrial land is particularly strong,'' said Paul D. Cohen, an executive vice president of SBWE Inc, a New Jersey-based real estate brokerage. ''There are three million square feet under construction or about to start at Exit 8A,'' he said, referring to the exit of the New Jersey Turnpike in South Brunswick Township that is about 60 miles southwest of New York.</p>
        <p>''And that's a second choice for most of them, since they would rather be closer to the city,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The Jersey Gardens outlet mall in Elizabeth is probably the best known brownfield redevelopment in the state. The 225-store mall sits on the site of the old Elizabeth town dump, which was covered with clean dirt and equipped with drainage pipes to prepare for the new structure. Now the company that did the mall site, OENJ-Cherokee, is filling in another old dump, this one in Bayonne, to prepare it for an 18-hole public golf course. It is also attempting to develop land to the east of the mall with 700,000 square feet of modern office space and a ferry link to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Some of these projects are tied to the Port of New York and New Jersey, which is concentrated along the waterfront of the cities of Newark and Elizabeth. Both the Meadowlands and Bayonne golf course projects are based on using material dredged from the harbor to cap the contaminated land.</p>
        <p>And as the dredging deepens the port so that it can receive the new generation of large container ships, traffic planners are looking to develop brownfields near the docks to house facilities to handle the larger volumes of cargo. Then, they envision value-added distribution operations that would generate needed jobs in the poorer, urban areas near the port.</p>
        <p>In addition to the pressure of the market, real estate executives and consultants say, activity is being generated by developers, financiers and government officials who have become more sophisticated about brownfields in recent years. In particular, they have recognized that a lightly polluted brownfield is different from a heavily contaminated Superfund site, one that has been designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as one of the most dangerous in the nation.</p>
        <p>UNDER Superfund rules, a broad range of companies associated with a site -- owners, concerns that operated plants and companies that dumped waste -- can be made responsible for the entire cost of the cleanup. Thus, developers have been reluctant to get involved with them because of the unknown cost of making a site acceptable, and lenders have often refused to provide financing, because a builder's default might make them the owner of the property -- with the consequent legal and financial responsibility for its cleanup.</p>
        <p>The increasing attractiveness of brownfields in New Jersey is in part a result of legislation passed in 1998 under which the state provides financial incentives to promote the reuse of brownfields and does not insist that they be cleaned to a uniform standard. If a site is to remain industrial and is distant from residences, it might have only to be capped with clean material, leaving the contamination enclosed at the site.</p>
        <p>Sites that could pose a danger to human health, such as as those near housing or schools, would have to meet a much stiffer standard.</p>
        <p>Attitudes toward brownfields vary from state to state. In New York, some planners and architects complain that a law requiring sites to be cleaned to a pristine standard is preventing economic development in places like the South Bronx and Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Ronald Shiffman, director of Pratt Institute's Center for Community and Environmental Development, said such a regulatory climate drives development toward sites in suburban and rural areas that have never been used by industry, bypassing economically needy urban locations.</p>
        <p>The Pratt center is part of a group known as the Brownfields Coalition, which proposed legislation that would encourage the establishment of cleanup standards based on how the property would be used and incentives for voluntary cleanups. The bill was not acted upon by the Legislature in Albany, with the result, according to a coalition statement, that ''New York is hemorrhaging businesses, jobs and tax revenues to states who have changed the way they do business to encourage private investment in their brownfield sites.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shiffman said: ''We have prime real estate along the Hudson River and in Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Red Hook that are in need of infrastructure investment and work force training, but it is not happening.''</p>
        <p>There are few tracts of land in the metropolitan region that have been treated as badly as the New Jersey Meadowlands. Before the value of wetlands as wildlife habitat, flood control systems and water filters was recognized, the Meadowlands were treated as useless swamps, a place to dump unwanted garbage and trash.</p>
        <p>The 32-square mile area in Bergen and Hudson Counties is now represented by the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, which has planning and zoning jurisdiction over towns within its borders.</p>
        <p>The commission has a tentative agreement with EnCap Golf of Tampa, Fla., to lease the land for 99 years for the golf development in the Meadowlands, which may also include a hotel, time-share condominiums and other development. The company would pay to properly cap old landfills on the site that are leaching contaminated liquid into nearby waterways and emitting methane gas as a result of the decomposition of organic matter. Some of the landfills are considered ''orphans'' because the towns and private companies that once used them have either disappeared or declined financial responsibility.</p>
        <p>''All these landfills were abandoned in the 1970's,'' said Alan J. Steinberg, executive director of the commission. ''Golf is a means of having the private sector pay for closure and to enhance the quality of the Hackensack River watershed.'' He added that the project would help to improve the appearance of sections of the Meadowlands that are clearly visible from the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike and would help to reduce ocean pollution by providing an upland site for the disposal of mud dredged from New York harbor as part of the deepening project.</p>
        <p>Although heavily developed, the Meadowlands remain that most unusual of locations, an ''urban wilderness,'' Mr. Steinberg said. Some 3,600 acres of the 19,000 acres in the tract remain as open space and most are still wetlands. Commission officials say the remaining wetlands are a vital feeding and resting area for migratory birds passing though the area.</p>
        <p>Even on the areas that have long since been despoiled, like the landfills, the Meadowlands' proximity to Manhattan is a big part of its appeal as a recreation area. ''EnCap people speak about 'experience tourism,' '' Mr. Steinberg said. He said the opportunity to play golf with the Manhattan skyline in the background of the 120 foot high landfill is expected to attract visitors who might also be persuaded to do some eco-touring in the wetlands.</p>
        <p>The Meadowlands golf proposal is an indication of the state's increasingly activist approach to brownfield redevelopment, said Jane M. Kenny, New Jersey's commissioner of community affairs and chairwoman of the state's Brownfields Task Force. ''We were overly cautious in the past, but now we are more aggressive,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Development of urban brownfields is tied directly to the effort to preserve open space in the densely crowded state, she said. ''We have a goal of preserving one million acres of open space, so the question becomes, where do you grow,'' Ms. Kenny said. ''So brownfields become the flip side of preserving open space.'' State and local efforts to preserve open space by subjecting developers' plans in rural areas to intense scrutiny can nudge them to look more favorably at brownfields, said Mr. Whitman, the environmental consultant. ''Once a developer has financing, timing is important,'' he said. ''If he is facing a 24 month approval time in a suburb versus a 12 month approval in an urban area, he is likely to choose the latter.''</p>
        <p>Brownfield development nationally is being aided by more sophisticated regulation, said Ronald B. Bruder, president of Brookhill Group, which specializes in developing contaminated properties.</p>
        <p>Rather than insisting that all of such a site be cleaned to a pristine standard, he said, regulators are now willing to use devices like deed restrictions to prevent public contact with polluted land.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he said, redevelopment will always be more difficult than an initial development on a greenfield. ''These deals are complicated,'' he said. ''It can take as long as two years to figure out how to deal with a site.''</p>
        <p>Because of that difficulty, he said, brownfield development is more sensitive to the state of the economy than the rest of the industry. ''If the real estate market starts to cool, the brownfield market will cool off a lot faster,'' Mr. Bruder said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg, the Meadowlands official,  said economic development in the Meadowlands is intended to finance preservation of the remaining open space and wetlands. ''If a wetland is functional, we are opposed to developing one square inch of it,'' he said. ''If an area is degraded and there is no funding for restoration, we will consider development of a smaller portion of the tract if the developer will mitigate the larger portion.''</p>
        <p>The first, 36 hole, phase of the golf course plan is intended to close three ''orphan'' landfills in an environmentally secure manner plus one that is currently in operation.</p>
        <p>The second phase would add 36 more holes of golf and include the towering site in North Arlington, where the commission currently operates a landfill accepting construction debris and nontoxic industrial waste. ''We are totally self-funded, but we would be happy to get out of the solid waste business and collect lease payments,'' he said.</p>
        <p>William Gauger, the president of EnCap,  said the company planned to begin construction of the first Meadowlands golf course next July, with completion expected in July 2005. The expected cost is $70 million to $75 million, he said.</p>
        <p>The second phase might be built in parallel with the first, with the second golf course opening in 2007. At least one of the courses will be open to the public, Mr. Gauger said. The project includes a hotel with 500 to 600 rooms, which that would open in 2007, and a marina on the Hackensack.</p>
        <p>EnCap Golf is an offshoot of Environmental Capital International, which specializes in supplying capital to environmental concerns. Mr. Gauger said putting golf courses on top of old dumps is a common reuse of such sites, with more than 60 already in operation. One of the oldest is the Marine Park course in Brooklyn, which was built in the early 1960's.</p>
        <p>One advantage of putting golf courses, rather than buildings, on old landfills is that there is little danger of damage if the ground subsides. Mr. Gauger said a golf course built on top of 350 feet of garbage in the Los Angeles area has subsided 50 feet in the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>Developing golf courses on top of landfills is a way of turning eyesores into assets and increasing the value of adjacent land, Mr. Gauger said. He said the group hoped to do additional development near its golf projects, including office properties.</p>
        <p>Brownfield development of a different sort is on the minds of officials of the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority.  Glancing out the window of its offices on the 17th floor of One Newark Center at the industrial tracts to the east in Hudson and Union Counties one day recently, John V. Hummer, the agency's special projects manager, said, ''That's all brownfields out there.''</p>
        <p>The agency, he said, is anticipating a large increase in containerized freight from the Far East as dredging, first to 45 feet and ultimately to 50 feet, allows the ports in Newark and Elizabeth to accommodate a new generation of larger ships. The problem will be moving all that traffic through an already congested area. But there is also an opportunity to capture some economic advantage by doing some processing of that cargo before it leaves the region.</p>
        <p>''The projections for traffic growth in the port are astonishing,'' he said. ''It is expected to double in 10 years, and we are already up to the level expected in 2004.'' In addition to seagoing freight, the adjacent Newark Airport is expected to become one of the nation's air cargo centers.</p>
        <p>THE agency, a federally funded planning organization that is affiliated with New Jersey Institute of Technology, has a mandate to develop plans to move freight through the region by locating facilities on brownfields.</p>
        <p>One of the proposals the agency is studying calls for building a special road, called the Portway, for trucks moving containers from the docks to nearby warehouses and processing centers. This is intended to reduce some of the pressure on the northern stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike, which often resembles a race track for trucks, and to ease congestion on local roads.</p>
        <p>Another is to direct more of the traffic, particularly freight traveling long distances, off the highways and onto trains. ''The issue is railyard and rail capacity,'' Mr. Hummer said. When Conrail was operating the freight system in the Northeast, it shrunk capacity to cut costs, he said. As a result, a rail system in the northern part of New Jersey that could accommodate 250 freight trains a day in 1960 can handle only 70 trains a day at present.</p>
        <p>And this is at a time of increased demand for passenger rail service that competes for time and space on the same track system.</p>
        <p>The economics of transportation are such that railroads make money only on hauls of over 400 miles, so local distribution will continue to be based on trucks.</p>
        <p>This presents an opportunity for brownfield development, Mr. Hummer said. Shippers in the Far East, he said, use the entire capacity of containers ''without concern for weight restriction.'' But, he said ''we have weight restrictions, so the containers have to be unpacked and loaded in multiple containers.''</p>
        <p>As long as the containers are being unpacked, he said, some light processing of the cargo can be done, such as sewing labels on clothing or adding bar codes and labels to goods before they are repacked for transit. ''We have an opportunity to add value,'' he said, ''and jobs beyond the usual ones in a warehouse, at locations near the terminal.''</p>
        <p>Regardless of the final use, brownfield developments have to make sense as real estate deals before the environmental costs are added in, said Andrew W. Savitz, an environmental specialist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. ''If the real estate does not work, the deal is not going to work,'' he said. ''But if it does, it's good for both the environment and the developer.''</p>
