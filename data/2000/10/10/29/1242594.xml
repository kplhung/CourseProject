        <p>JOE DIMAGGIO</p>
        <p>The Hero's Life.</p>
        <p>By Richard Ben Cramer.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 546 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $28.</p>
        <p>So far, psychohistory, or psycho-documentary, has not been kind to Joe DiMaggio. Strong, silent types have to take their chances in these talkative times, and Joe's manly reserve can easily be turned into paranoid shyness, and his High Style, or Bella Figura, into an obsession with his image. And nothing is easier to deconstruct than ''classiness,'' whatever that is.</p>
        <p>Probably the best bet for such a punching bag is to find the right writer and let him explain you. Joe's contemporary Ted Williams, a seemingly harder case, brought excellent results by confiding in Richard Ben Cramer, who responded to Ted's late-blooming garrulity with a reassuring Esquire essay about him that rang absolutely true.</p>
        <p>But among their other differences, Ted had never been married to Marilyn Monroe, or had to read about what a boring husband he'd been, or how many glamorous lovers had followed hot on his heels; and Ted had never been questioned by the cops about possible mob connections; and in fact Ted had never done much of anything except hit baseballs and catch fish. Joe, on the other hand, had reasons of both prudence and sensibility for silence, and while he got on fine with sportswriters who stuck to the subject, he couldn't have cooperated with one of those other guys if his very image depended on it.</p>
        <p>So in ''Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life,'' Cramer is faced with the daunting task of reading the mind of a man totally unlike himself or any of us, and he decides to wade right in, starting his book with a bravura feat of ESP in re DiMaggio's last, dying appearance at Yankee Stadium in 1998, which, it turns out, was chiefly about ''money, mostly money, as it mostly was with Joe. . . . The fact was, DiMaggio was never wistful. (At that moment, he was furious.) And he never spent an instant in his life to marvel at the beauty of anything. Except maybe a broad.''</p>
        <p>The fact was? Never? Obviously, clairvoyance is not going to be a problem for this author. But there's also a twin problem of seeing Joe's world exactly as he saw it, and this may be even tougher, because it requires leaping over several generation gaps and landing on one's feet. For instance, take the charge that Joe never allowed anyone close enough to see inside him -- a sin that seems particularly odious to journalists. But by chance this same charge has also been leveled at such amiable survivors as Ronald Reagan and Johnny Carson. Which suggests that back in the 30's and 40's nobody got close to anyone in the current sense. ''Authenticity'' hadn't arrived yet and style was still king, the more understated the better. So Joe's persona fit the times perfectly, alongside such other impenetrable surfaces as those of Fred Astaire, the Talk of the Town section in The New Yorker and that other quiet, classy champion, Joe Louis, who incidentally was also rumored to like blond actresses.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the author gets halfway off this hook by stressing Joe's uniqueness in any period, which translates to mean that your guess about him is as good as mine. Anyhow, Cramer wastes no time establishing his own version, crowding the reader with short, punchy sentences and leaving barely room for a second opinion. By the end of the first couple of pages, we know that winning is absolutely everything with DiMaggio and that he is also preternaturally greedy.</p>
        <p>Pausing a moment here for breath, one notes that these two traits commonly fold into each other with athletes. If the game is about money, athletes can indeed be greedy beyond belief. But club owners make a big mistake if they think this is the same kind of greed as their own; because if the game switches to how long you can go without money, athletes will sign on for that too. And that one they will win.</p>
        <p>So could Joe have played that game and, say, sat out a long strike with his teammates? In the early stage it doesn't seem possible, because the author suggests that Joe wasn't that interested in baseball, or in other people, or in anything else you can put your finger on. And actually his all-consuming greed proved to be no match for his indifference: he dropped out of school, but not to make money, even by tagging along on his father's fishing boat. So one pictures young Joe at that point just hanging out and waiting for TV to be invented.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, two other factors would kick in during his early teens to jerk our hero to life, and then some. For one, Joe became so unmistakably good at baseball, and there was so much of it going around in the 30's, that he was soon getting paid for it anyway. And for another, his famous ''aura'' -- which is described here as an unearthly calmness at his core, and an almost regal self-assurance (this guy lives full time in the eye of the hurricane: stick with him and you'll be O.K.) -- began to surface.</p>
        <p>Which raises the old Pygmalion conundrum: does being treated like a duchess make you one, or do you have to be a duchess to get the treatment? Whichever. Royalty has certain obligations, and Joe took them seriously, working for the first time really hard at baseball, at which he was not quite a total ''natural'' after all (he never could learn to play shortstop), and also turning himself into a gentleman about town. In 1936, a Time reporter sent a memo to his office describing the DiMaggios in general as ''curiously closed-mouthed, uninteresting and uninterested,'' so Joe had to start at the very beginning, and he apprenticed himself forthwith to the most urbane people he could find, most notably Lefty O'Doul in San Francisco and Lefty Gomez in New York. (Joe, Cramer tells us, particularly liked being around funny people, but this is not really explained: maybe he thought wit was classy and hence profitable.)</p>
        <p>And here the analyst has to down tools for a moment as DiMaggio's actual career on the field flashes by. You can only debunk a great athlete so much, because all that really mattered about him is safely locked away forever in the record books, and only a little less safely on film and tape. And while you can still whittle Joe's personal records down a bit with exegesis, there's not a thing you can do about his team records. In brief: During the three previous years, when Lou Gehrig had been their hero in residence, the Yankees had won no pennants at all. In Joe D.'s first four years, they would win 16 out of 19 World Series games.</p>
        <p>This just doesn't happen, any more than 56-game hitting streaks happen, unless you chance to be a diamond king, in which case your talent combined with your aura may make even the laws of probability tremble a little. And then, after World War II, when Joe's skill had diminished slightly (they said he couldn't hit the slider, or quite get around on the fastball), he proved how much a king could do on aura alone, by fairly willing himself to hit the slider and get the bat around if a big game was on the line, and by leading a makeshift, rebuilding Yankees team to four more world championships through sheer imperious example. ''Win it for the Dago'' -- a name he went along with being called, thus making it an honorific.</p>
        <p>THIS was the DiMaggio legend, and it's hard to imagine anyone old enough not to believe in Wheaties expecting anything more of him. But of course, there was more of him anyway, and after some genuinely exciting baseball writing, the critic is back in full force to unload on it. Even during the intermission, when Joe has to join the Army and play ball for Uncle Sam, he becomes instantly a much smaller man. In fact, Joe actually cries at having to enlist, presumably over all the money it's going to cost him, or if not that, over the probability that his first wife will jump ship during his absence (she seems awfully eager for him to join), which will also cost him money and hurt his vanity as well.</p>
        <p>In other words, Joe just can't buy a break in this book. But his years after baseball pretty much had to be unsatisfactory anyway. Suddenly the king had no throne and no duties, and nothing to do at all except to hustle his own name and his memorabilia. And if this was to be the only game in town now, we can guess that he's going to play it hard, especially as the active players suddenly began to make more money than he'd ever seen in his life.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, though, there was one crowd that really knew how to treat a king, especially a Sicilian one, and that also knew a thing or two about peddling relics. Joe's first small link to the mob back in the 1930's had seemed harmless enough. In the lull between Prohibition and the war against drugs, knowing a few gangsters was no worse than bribing the building inspector or the fire inspector or the State Liquor Authority. It was just another aspect of life in New York. But even then, this was a shabby court for Joe to reign over, and it played to his trashiest pretensions, providing him with endless showgirls -- i.e., by pimping for him -- and softening him up with countless favors and, worse yet, with a slush fund at the Bowery Savings Bank that would set him up for life.</p>
        <p>A saint would, no doubt, have said a stern no to each of these, but for a poor kid from a despised minority, a little help from some compadres -- well, it might look a little different. Anyway, all these gifts would come to haunt him in retirement, because suddenly the mob wasn't a joke anymore, and only Joe's aura kept him from a humiliating investigation and a Sinatra-like reputation. So he had to look classy now for dear life, and also for income. A DiMaggio collectible had to be in mint condition or there was no sale.</p>
        <p>Even the showgirls would haunt him indirectly, because naturally enough, he married two of them, but he expected them to be different showgirls, the kind who keep their talk clean and their skirts down instead of up, up and away. And, not surprisingly, it didn't work out too well.</p>
        <p>Yet falling in love, however foolishly, seemed to work wonders for DiMaggio himself, and two of his rare, totally human and likable moments occur when he believes for a while that he's going to keep his first wife after all, and then most movingly when he thinks the same about Marilyn Monroe just before her death (or, as he believed, murder). In a desperate attempt to reconquer Marilyn's flaky heart, Joe had gone to see a shrink, and had emerged most attractively shrunken, modest and self-knowledgeable. ''I'm not great,'' he tells Gay Talese a couple of years later. ''I'm just a man trying to get along.'' Now if he can just hold that thought.</p>
        <p>At this point, the author chooses mysteriously, but not unwelcomingly, to jump forward 23 years, from 1966 to 1989, and at first it looks as if our hero has aged grotesquely. Everything that could go wrong with DiMaggio has done so, and we find that his avarice has now reached cartoonlike proportions, in equal parts voracious and mightily and utterly ruthless (if Paul Simon's nation really wanted to turn its lonely eyes to him, it would have to pay an arm and a leg for it), and that his heart since Marilyn has grown so cold that he callously skips the funerals of old friends like O'Doul and Gomez and breaks with his own son, Joe, in one of the most inhuman little scenes you will ever read.</p>
        <p>By now, one is practically praying for Joe to return from the dead and give his side of at least something around here. Although the book is too conscientiously researched to be called a reporter's revenge for the story that got away, the fact remains that very few subjects who cooperate ever have to take quite such a pounding as this, and one is left with the other gloomy conclusion that no one should be judged by his or her last years, although it happens all the time.</p>
        <p>BUT then, so late in the day that an impatient reader might have missed it, the tune changes for a few pages and we're told that ''sometimes, Joe got tired of talking about the money'' (as we certainly are reading about it), and we're briefly introduced to a totally different DiMaggio, who it seems likes to keep his life and himself quite separate from the one we've been looking at, and this one appears to have aged splendidly, like the real Dorian Gray. DiMaggio II turns out, for instance, to be a huge fan of Woody Allen, of all people, and is as tickled to have dinner with him as he is to explain baseball to an ecstatic Henry Kissinger. Also, this DiMaggio never misses the television program ''Meet the Press'' and loves Tim Russert too; and more surprisingly yet, can be quite humbly charming and solicitous to people who aren't even celebrities and aren't even paying for it. (Or is this too about ''money, mostly money''?)</p>
        <p>So where has this guy been? And does he drop in often? One hesitates to tell an author on Page 473 that he ought to start his book over again, let alone make it longer. But Joe II would have been essential evidence at every stage of the story, and his almost total omission gives one a queasy feeling about the author's own agenda -- a queasiness that is reinforced when he turns the Good DiMaggio off sharply after just eight pages, and returns us to Mr. Scrooge, in time to see him lose his final game of Money, as athletes are wont to do, to a man who plays it much more skillfully than he does. Although Joe fortunately would not live long enough ever to know what hit him, this still makes for a pathetic and thoroughly deflated ending to the shrunken figure of the great DiMaggio as he limps out of the book.</p>
        <p>Cramer has the grace not to ride his implied message about this too hard, that this is what we do to our heroes: we spoil them and mythologize them and render them delusional before cruelly dropping them or, in this case, refusing to drop them. If so, there is nothing either new or particularly American about this. Mankind has always made too much of its saints and heroes, and how the latter handle the fuss might be called their final test. But I hesitate to grade Joe on this test for several reasons, one being that I feel he hasn't received a wholehearted defense yet, another because I don't completely trust Cramer's historical judgment (he says the barbarous Ty Cobb ''wasn't far from baseball's mean main street'' and calls the Gashouse Gang the most ''dementedly combative'' team of all time, two cinema noir exaggerations that serve as fair warning), and a third, because the author's overexposed you-are-there style only reminds you that you are not there and don't really know what these people are thinking at all. By trying to go the truth one better, the famous ''new journalism'' continually undercuts it, and you can't hang a man on this kind of evidence.</p>
        <p>But my chief reason for hesitation is, who wants to grade Joe anyway? To even a fledgling old-timer, the real symbol of the current moment is not so much DiMaggio as this book -- over 500 pages, taking five years to write, just to knock the old boy off his pedestal. Or at least that's how it reads. And it does succeed in knocking his halo askew, which might perhaps be worth a few pages. But it doesn't come close to cracking the mystery, or explaining the aura. The calmness at DiMaggio's center can't just have been an emptiness, or else how could so many people have loved him so much and enjoyed his company so endlessly? Some of these friends were shrewd, and a few of them didn't even need him. Yet while Joe might break up his friendships with them for inscrutable reasons, they never seemed to have broken theirs with him, even in death. No one is ordering the surviving ones to be silent now. They're just doing it for the Dago. And perhaps if you can find the old newsreels of Joe posing shyly with Marilyn and juxtapose them with film of Joe catching the ball over his shoulder as he lopes along, you'll see why. Words were not Joe's medium, and you won't find him in words now. But this book does contain some evocative pictures and, if you can turn down the editorializing, some provocative and very entertaining information as well. And if you round out your day with a visit to a good film library, you've probably done the best that can be done, and perhaps we can move on -- to Dominic DiMaggio?</p>
