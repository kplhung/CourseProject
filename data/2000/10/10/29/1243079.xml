        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I was pleased to see the World Series celebrated on the field, without incident. But Major League Baseball missed another opportunity to capture the still disillusioned fans. This year would have been a perfect chance to see the two teams line up and shake hands, like hockey does after a series. Most of the Mets were still in the dugout, looking out at the field and the Yankees' celebration.</p>
