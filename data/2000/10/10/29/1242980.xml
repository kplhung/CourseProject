        <p>The greatness of the Yankees could be found in their World Series performance, in their surge in August, or in their three-game sweep in Boston in September. But for Reggie Jackson, the Yankees of 2000 could be defined by how they responded to the late-season collapse that nearly wrecked the dynasty.</p>
        <p>The Yankees lost their last seven regular-season games, the worst finish for any playoff-bound team in baseball history, and they lost 15 of their last 18 games, the worst period of losing for any of the eight teams that qualified for the playoffs this season.</p>
        <p>But they won the World Series, again. ''This is a year that really is the whole story in itself,'' Jackson said. ''Nobody's had a great year. They've had a lot of injuries. Everybody has had a tough time, and toward the end of the season they struggled mightily.</p>
        <p>''Everybody struggled, but everybody, from the management to the staff to the players, recognized that they knew how to be a team -- how to be a great team. Experience, guile, tenacity, winning when you're not at your best. The 2000 Yankees are what winning three in a row is all about.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees were 37-35 on June 28 and trailed Toronto by three games. On Aug. 13, Roger Clemens beat Anaheim, and the Yankees won 22 of their next 31 games, including three in a row in Fenway Park on Sept. 8-10, building their lead to nine games. They seemed in control of the division -- then completely collapsed.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not hold so much as a lead at any moment in their last nine road games and were outscored by 94-21. Their collective earned run average in the last 18 games was 8.03. They batted .239 and averaged barely over three runs a game, after batting .282 and scoring almost six runs a game in the first 143 games.</p>
        <p>What happened? How did the Yankees disintegrate? Manager Joe Torre does not believe that the players lost their intensity after the Yankees buried the Red Sox; he thinks they fell into a slump and tried too hard to break out.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the collapse, some of his veterans thought differently. After a 16-3 loss in Toronto on Sept. 19, catcher Jorge Posada said he and Derek Jeter had talked about how the team was already looking toward the playoffs and overlooking the rest of the regular season. ''When it gets to September,'' Jeter said, ''I think guys just want to get September over with and get the playoffs started.''</p>
        <p>Lowly Tampa Bay swept three games from the Yankees on Sept. 26-28, outscoring them by 24-5. The reliever Mike Stanton said in Tampa Bay that after the sweep of the Red Sox, ''the intensity we had up until that point hasn't been there.''</p>
        <p>''I think there was a big exhale once this Boston series was over,'' he said. ''It's like the old parable: You push to row upstream in a river, and you don't stop rowing once you get to where you want. You have to keep pushing, and for a short time, we've stopped rowing.''</p>
        <p>Torre held a team meeting after the Sept. 19 loss in Toronto, blistering the club for its poor play; the veterans agreed with him and determined to play better, a resolution that had always worked. But this time it made no difference: they kept losing, horrifically. They were crushed in their last seven games by 15-4, 2-1, 11-1, 11-3, 13-2, 9-1 and 7-3. With three days remaining in the season, the Yankees had begun to flirt with the worst disaster in baseball history.</p>
        <p>But they finally clinched the division on Sept. 29, with two games remaining, when the Red Sox lost to Tampa Bay. At the moment they learned they were American League East champions, the Yankees were in the late innings of another double-digit defeat to the Orioles, and they were not sure whether to celebrate until Torre gave them the O.K. to open the Champagne, to feel good about achieving the goal of winning the division. It was a smart move: Torre had turned a negative into a positive, just three days before the playoffs started.</p>
        <p>Jeter, never lacking for confidence, insisted that once the playoffs started, the late-season slump would be irrelevant. Other Yankees had their doubts -- not about whether the team had the talent to win, but about whether there was enough time for a team comprising so many slumping players to turn its season around.</p>
        <p>They continued to struggle for hits in their division series against Oakland and lost Game 1. But in Game 2, Andy Pettitte pitched seven and two-thirds shutout innings and Glenallen Hill hit a single to drive home the first run in the sixth inning, and the turnaround began. With the three-of-five-game series tied at 2-2, the Yankees flew back to Oakland for Game 5, scoring six runs in the first inning and barely hanging on to win.</p>
        <p>That was the turning point, Bernie Williams recalled early Friday morning as he placed a flute of Champagne on a shelf in his locker. They had survived the late-season slump and gotten through the first round. ''That was so hard,'' Williams said, chuckling.</p>
        <p>The slump would determine how the Yankees would be remembered, once the playoffs were over: As a crumbling team that fell apart, the dynasty over, baseball's Rome; or, as Jackson said, a team with extraordinary mental toughness.</p>
