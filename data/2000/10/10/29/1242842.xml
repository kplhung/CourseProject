        <p>The witnesses came forward nearly two years after two state troopers shot at unarmed minority men in a van on the turnpike, but their accounts led state prosecutors to drop a charge of attempted murder against one of the troopers last week. Two drivers for United Parcel Service said the men's van was moving toward state trooper John Hogan, as he had claimed, when he fired at it in April 1998,  wounding three of the passengers. Prosecutors had said the shots were fired as the vehicle rolled away. Mr. Hogan is still charged with aggravated assault, and his partner, James Kenna, still faces charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault.</p>
