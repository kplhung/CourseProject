        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her review of my biography ''Doris Lessing'' (Oct. 15), Miranda Seymour says that I had conversations with Robert Gottlieb about Lessing. It is clearly stated in the text and chapter notes that I was given access to their two-decade correspondence, and that is where my information was taken from. William Koshland, a former president of Alfred A. Knopf, was the person who made this possible.</p>
        <p>By the way, I continue to think that Doris Lessing is one of the most important living writers.</p>
