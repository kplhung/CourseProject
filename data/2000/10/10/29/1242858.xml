        <p>Loudon Wainwright III has two main claims to fame: the satiric 1973 hit ''Dead Skunk'' and the topical songs about figures like Tonya Harding (''Tonya's Twirls'') and Jesse Helms (''Jesse Don't Like It'') that he has written for National Public Radio.</p>
        <p>But there is more to the singer-songwriter than his smart-aleck side, especially lately, as he has turned out wistful, lyrical songs about fatherhood and the loss of his parents. One new song, ''Last Man on Earth,'' which Mr. Wainwright played a few months ago on ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien,'' has become an emerging anthem for the lost-in-cyberspace set. Midway through the song, when Mr. Wainwright sings, ''Everybody's got a Web site but that's all Greek to me/ I don't own a computer and I hate that letter E,'' concert audiences often burst into applause.</p>
