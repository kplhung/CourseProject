        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Ellen Willis's article about the film ''The Contender'' raises the question, ''What would happen if a politician at the center of a sex scandal were a woman?'' [''Mix Sex and Politics; Add a Feminist Twist,'' Oct. 15]. The implication is that a man can enjoy sexual high jinks in college without being castigated for it later and that a woman cannot.</p>
        <p>But the real question arises later in the article, when it is revealed that the heroine, Senator Laine Hanson, had had an affair with her best friend's husband and subsequently married him. She is ''pained'' at having hurt her friend, Ms. Willis writes, but she ''won't pretend to be sorry.''</p>

        <p>I find it morally reprehensible for any person, male or female, to have an affair with the spouse of a friend, and then compound the error by marrying that spouse, cavalierly elbowing the friend out of the way. The issue is not one of sexual behavior. The real question is this: Do we want a vice president or president who admittedly lies, cheats, steals and injures his or her best friend in the name of ''falling in love''? I think not.</p>
