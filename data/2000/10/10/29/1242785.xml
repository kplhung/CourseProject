        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>After spending a couple of days at home, I sent my daughter back to school with this letter addressed to the attendance office at Northern Highlands Regional High School in Allendale. Yes, I did what many of you have wanted to do. The letter said:</p>
        <p>Dear Highlands Staff,</p>
        <p>Please take Emily back. She was home on Thursday and Friday of last week with a bad cold, fever and sore throat.</p>
        <p>During that time she watched at least 10 hours of television per day, drank five gallons of assorted juices and soft drinks, consumed countless snacks and left a pile of dirty linens, plates and glasses throughout the house.</p>
        <p>Your cooperation would be greatly appreciated.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Simon</p>
        <p>LARCENY</p>
        <p>From door to door for tricks or treats,</p>
        <p>Attired in rags of disrepute,</p>
        <p>Marauding bands solicit sweets</p>
        <p>With shopping bags to stash their loot.</p>
        <p>For fear of them, you dare not spurn</p>
        <p>Tenacious Tim and Little Liz</p>
        <p>Who, from your acquiescence, learn</p>
        <p>How lucrative extortion is.</p>
        <p>Bob McKenty</p>
        <p>There it was on the October calendar -- E.S.P.A. testing for the fifth grade:</p>
        <p>Tuesday, social studies;</p>
        <p>Wednesday, visual and performing arts;</p>
        <p>Thursday: makeup.</p>
        <p>''Makeup?'' my son said. ''I don't even wear it. How do they expect me to pass a test on it?''</p>
        <p>(If you want to thicken your lashes, do you wear (a) eyeliner; (b) eyebrow pencil; (c) mascara; (d) blush.)</p>
        <p>Jessica Lauria</p>
        <p>A sign in a shop window in Rancocas Woods: ''If we are closed, just shove the money under the door.''</p>
        <p>Arthur Simeone</p>
        <p>Scene: A young man was sitting on a bench in the Rockaway Townsquare mall with two children, a whiny boy about and an infant.</p>
        <p>''What a beautiful baby,'' said one woman, who stopped to admire the infant. ''I wish her were mine.''</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I wish he were yours,'' snapped the little boy.</p>
        <p>Audrey Corn</p>
        <p>Another mall story; a different mall. A man and a woman had stopped to inspect the offerings at a Japanese restaurant in the food court at Willowbrook Mall.</p>
        <p>''Do you think we would like the sushi?'' the woman asked.</p>
        <p>''No,'' he said. ''But I bet it would make great bait.''</p>
        <p>MORE THAN ONCE</p>
        <p>UPON A MATTRESS</p>
        <p>My mattress is so soft and deep</p>
        <p>I love to lay me down to sleep.</p>
        <p>You know who made it. Take a guess . . .</p>
        <p>The maker's name begins with ''S.''</p>
        <p>Hint: Sealy, Serta, Simmons or Stearns and Foster.</p>
