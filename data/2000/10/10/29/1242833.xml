        <p>THE GLOBE  +  (212) 545-8800; 373 Park Avenue South, between 26th and 27th Streets; $$; smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This peculiar but playful restaurant has a wide-ranging menu that varies from day to day. Current appetizers include tuna and salmon tartare with cilantro-mustard sauce and gaufrette potatoes; and roasted shrimp flatbread with cilantro, pesto and Monterey jack cheese. Main courses include grilled herb-marinated hanger steak and boniato  mash, vegetable ratatouille and port wine reduction; roasted monkfish with lobster ravioli and Parisienne vegetables in a saffron lobster broth; and seared yellowfin tuna nicoise with red bliss potato salad. ($25 and Under: 10/25/97; entrees are now $18.50 to $23)</p>
        <p>LES HALLES  +++  (212) 679-4111; 411 Park Avenue South, between 28th and 29th Streets; $$$; smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Taking its name from Paris's legendary wholesale food market, Les Halles also functions as a French meat market. Appetizers include snails in garlic sauce; warm potato and goat cheese salad; and duck livers and gizzards fricassee with port wine sauce. Entrees include sea scallops, black truffle sauce and leek flan; pork tenderloin, garlic confit and mashed potatoes; and mussels steamed in white wine. (New York Today: April 1998)</p>
        <p>PARK BISTRO  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 689-1360; 414 Park Avenue South, between 28th and 29th Streets; $$$; smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>A classic French bistro, from the decor to the menu. Current appetizers include upside-down tart with herbed goat cheese and caramelized onions; wild mushroom ravioli; and chilled lobster salad and baby artichokes with black truffle vinaigrette. Main dishes include duck confit and pan-seared breast, with lingonberries; halibut in a potato crust, red wine Chinon sauce with chanterelles; and chicken fricassee in a curry sauce with raisins and apples. (Review: 4/27/90; article: 7/14/00)</p>
        <p>PATRIA  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 777-6211; 250 Park Avenue South, at 20th Street; $$$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Boisterous and happy, the multilevel dining room feels like a party every night. Current appetizers include black lobster empanada with grilled squid; scallop ceviche and beef tartare with truffle dressing, port wine reduction and Latin root vegetable chips; and shrimp marinated in orange, lime juice, achiote and red lime chili. Entrees include plantain coated mahi-mahi with tofu; red snapper fillet with shrimp, stewed in coconut milk, cashews and yuca with Brazilian hearts of palm salad; and beef tenderloin grilled with chimichurri, medula wine sauce, pan roasted potatoes and mushrooms. (Review: 9/27/96)</p>
        <p>RIBOLLITA  +  (212) 982-0975; 260 Park Avenue South, near 21st Street; $$; smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The food at Ribollita offers the sort of hearty flavors that are so hard to find, as if its kitchen were filled with loving Italian grandmothers. Starters include toasted bread wrapped with ham and Italian goat's milk cheese served with mesclun salad, fresh pears and truffle oil; asparagus and smoked prosciutto baked with fontina cheese; and country tomato and bread soup. Main dishes include roast loin of pork with garlic and rosemary served with roasted potatoes; shrimps in Cognac sauce with fresh chopped tomatoes and thyme on a bed of spinach; and spicy marinated Cornish hen flattened and roasted crisp with garlic and rosemary. ($25 and Under: 5/13/98)</p>
        <p>TRATTORIA I PAGLIACCI  +  (212) 505-3072; 240 Park Avenue South, between 19th and 20th Streets; $$; no smoking; cash only.</p>
        <p>The aromas here are like an olfactory still life of an Italian grocery. The nose is the primary sense organ in this dining room, at least until the first basket of focaccia arrives, when the mouth takes over. Antipasti selections include rolled mozzarella with pesto, prosciutto, red pepper and basil; sauteed shrimp and white beans; and marinated, grilled portobello mushrooms. Main dishes include beer-marinated chicken, grilled and served over a bed of spinach; veal rolled with ham and fontina cheese in a sherry-mushroom sauce; and breaded pork loin topped with arugula and chopped tomato salad. ($25 and Under: 8/9/96)</p>
        <p>Summaries taken from reviews use the star ratings. Others are taken from the $25 and Under column (+) and articles (++), and capsule revies from New York Today: www.nytoday.com (+++).</p>
        <p>What the Stars Mean</p>
        <p>**** -- Extraordinary  *** -- Excellent  ** -- Very Good  * -- Good  None Poor to Satisfactory</p>
        <p>Price Range  Based on the cost of a three-course dinner, per person, tax, tip and drinks not included.</p>
        <p>$ -- $25 and under  $$ -- $25 to $40  $$$ -- $40 to $55  $$$$ -- $55 and over</p>
        <p>Past Reviews -- Good Eating columns back to June 1998, along with reviews from The Times and capsule reviews by Times critics of additional restaurants not reviewed in the newspaper, are available on New York Today.</p>
