        <p>Hooky? Who said it was hooky?</p>
        <p>''Give me a break, Harold,''  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday, apparently in jest. His barb, aimed at Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, came a day after the mayor said it would be just fine for children to skip school tomorrow for the Yankees' ticker tape parade, and the chancellor responded that truancy would not be allowed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani claimed some inconsistency in the position of Mr. Levy, who signed his formal warning to students on Friday as ''Harold O. Levy, chief truant officer.''</p>
        <p>''Before he made that statement, he called up City Hall and asked for 10 tickets to the parade,'' the mayor said at a news conference at City Hall.</p>
        <p>Pamela McDonnell, a spokeswoman for the chancellor, said yesterday that Mr. Levy had been offered tickets to the parade, as is traditional. She said the tickets had been made available in part because a large number of public school students will be in the parade, including the members of 10 marching bands. She said she had been unable to contact Mr. Levy to determine whether he would attend himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani seemed to delight in his disagreement over educational priorities, at least as they related to the Yankees' fourth World Series victory in five years. ''I didn't say anybody should play hooky,'' said the mayor, who described ticker tape parades as ''mind-expanding'' events. ''Children should consult with their parents and then make a decision.''</p>
