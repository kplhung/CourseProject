        <p>Of all the tens of millions of dollars Jon S. Corzine has showered over New Jersey during his run for the Senate, one of the most audacious expenditures is his recent television commercial entitled ''In Debt.''</p>
        <p>The 30-second ad, which Mr. Corzine has been running in New York and Philadelphia alike, portrays his opponent, Representative Bob Franks, as the maitre d'hotel of the special interests because he accepted money from big pharmaceutical companies, utilities and insurance firms. It then makes the Orwellian claim that Mr. Corzine's money has somehow made him pure.</p>
        <p>''Jon Corzine. Unbought, unbossed,'' the narrator declares. ''Bob Franks. Deep in debt to the special interests.''</p>
        <p>Many of the facts in the ad are  even accurate. It is true that Mr. Franks has taken donations from groups connected to big business, and that his votes on several issues have been criticized by consumer groups. It is also indisputable that Mr. Corzine's enormous wealth has allowed him to run a lavish campaign without depending on money from big business or its Democratic equivalent: labor unions, trial lawyers and Hollywood moguls.</p>
        <p>But the contention that Mr. Corzine's riches will make him immune to outside influence seems to ignore the realities of New Jersey politics in general and this race in particular.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Mr. Corzine has not provided voters with enough information about his vast stock holdings to determine where his personal interests might lie. Mr. Corzine, the largest single shareholder in Goldman Sachs, has released only summaries of his tax returns, saying that his confidentiality agreement with the investment company forbids him from divulging more details.</p>
        <p>That ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on personal holdings leaves voters with no way to judge whether Mr. Corzine's $400 million fortune might depend on some foreign government or any of the countless business concerns that might be affected by a senator's actions.</p>
        <p>What is more important, Mr. Corzine has also built close ties to some of the most brazen bosses in all of politics, New Jersey's Democratic Party leaders.</p>
        <p>In recent years, wealthy candidates in California and other states have spent tens of millions of dollars to challenge the party apparatus. Most failed. Mr. Corzine recognized that his best chance was to have both money and the machine behind him. So during his 18-month journey from political novice to front-runner, he and his checkbook have been guided around the state by the various Democratic power brokers.</p>
        <p>He sent more than $650,000 to Democratic committees and candidates across the state. On primary day, the party delivered, giving Mr. Corzine a preferred position on the ballot in most counties and producing a voter turnout of more than 70 percent in many precincts. On Election Day, the party faithful will be expected to herd the troops to the ballot boxes again.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Corzine wins, is it realistic to assume that he will be any less beholden to his political patrons than Mr. Franks would be to his donors?  Already, members of Mr. Corzine's inner circle have spoken privately about a ''contingent liability'' growing within the ranks of the Democratic chairmen.</p>
        <p>''There are people who think they are owed something,'' said one adviser. ''And that's something we'll have to deal with after the election.''</p>
        <p>It is certainly Mr. Corzine's right to decide whether he will continue to use his personal wealth to underwrite the state party once the election is over. If he is elected, however, it seems naive to assume that party leaders won't also pressure him to deliver judicial assignments or legislative favors that might benefit the donors they depend upon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has also become closely allied with Senator Robert G. Torricelli, an insatiable fund-raiser and the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mr. Torricelli helped coax Mr. Corzine into the race, and they continue to consult frequently about campaign strategy. And when Mr. Corzine threw his candidacy into jeopardy in April by making offensive remarks about Italian-Americans, it was Mr. Torricelli who appeared beside him to defuse the crisis.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Torricelli announced that he was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in July, Mr. Corzine returned the favor by rescinding his endorsement of Jim McGreevey and claiming neutrality. Mr. Torricelli has since abandoned his gubernatorial plans. So what happens if, one day, Senator Torricelli asks Senator Corzine to cast a vote or -- insert language into a bill -- which just coincidentally benefits a pharmaceutical company, an asbestos manufacturer, or some other major donor to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.? Will Mr. Corzine have the political autonomy to buck Mr. Torricelli?</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine insists that he will be his own man. He's betting that his populist campaign platform, personal warmth and financial independence will persuade voters that he's a new breed of politician. Not everyone is convinced.</p>
        <p>''There has certainly been an exchange going on: Jon Corzine's money and the Democratic Party's political resources,'' said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers. ''You would expect that this kind of thing would continue, except with the people's money and not his own. That's the thing to be concerned about. And in this particular case, his inexperience in politics makes him more vulnerable to manipulation by party leaders.''</p>
