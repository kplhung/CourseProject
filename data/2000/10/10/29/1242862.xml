        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Ask No Questions, We'll Tell No Lies'' (Jersey, Oct. 8), about the Lyndhurst Board of Education filing a lawsuit against three citizens for harassment for asking so many questions, Debra Galant tells us she has children and she knows how irritating it can be to have so many questions asked. After reading her column, I, too, have some questions. Does Ms. Galant regularly attend school board meetings? Does she understand the commitment that some community residents make to serve their community as board members? Does she know the frustration they can feel at having to answer to everyone, and usually at any time? Does she know the cumulative effect of having to answer endless inane and harassing questions from supposed community ''advocates'' who are accountable to no one? Does she know how many people hide behind  ''advocacy'' to exact retribution for  personal and political wounds?</p>

        <p>Sure, elected community officials of any type are accountable to their community. But at what point do we insist on community accountability? Ms. Galant says these ''taxpayer advocates'' play ''an important role'' in their community, and they certainly can. But do these advocates regularly attend board meetings -- where all the information they seek is presented and easily available? Or do they wait until it has been filed and forgotten and then demand that it be produced? What effect does this conflict have on the children of that community? While its board is fighting the ''advocates'' and spending taxpayer money to supply reams of documentation to them, there is other school business that is not being done.</p>
