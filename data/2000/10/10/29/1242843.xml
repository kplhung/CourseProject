        <p>Nearly half of New Jersey's roads are in poor or fair condition and need improvements or repairs, and 38 percent of its bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, according to a study made for the New Jersey Alliance for Action and released last week. The report, made by the Road Information Program, a research group based in Washington, said  three of the roads most in need of repair were Route 4 in Bergen County, Route 21 in Newark and Routes 1 and 9 in Middlesex County.</p>
