        <p>''Man Against (Ready. Aim. Fire.) Nature,'' the cover article on Oct. 1, accurately depicted the daily routines of the vast number of New Jersey residents who love living with the state's wildlife and accurately  covered the issues.

        <p>''Man Against (Ready. Aim. Fire.) Nature,'' the cover article on Oct. 1, accurately depicted the daily routines of the vast number of New Jersey residents who love living with the state's wildlife and accurately  covered the issues. The accompanying article on the Woodlands Wildlife Refuge was a wonderful tribute to the Bear Education and Resource Group's efforts to educate all state residents that you and your children are safe around bears, even those that have cubs.</p>
        <p>As a resident of ''bear country'' for 28 of my 34 years, I have found nothing offensive about any of the wildlife here -- only great joy in watching it be. I have, walked barefoot in my lakefront backyard through goose droppings, amazed that they have no bad odor and washed off so easily (unlike my neighbor's dog's droppings). So the geese sure get my vote. As for their increase in numbers, my community addles their eggs, so we have enough geese to enjoy without perpetuating the needless fear that a population problem is brewing.</p>
        <p>I bought five copies of that issue and climbed into a Dumpster to find two others so I could send a copy to a group of nuns in Baltimore who, because of my efforts to stop the New Jersey bear hunt, had educated their students about bears. Several went to others in the bear group -- medical and veterinary doctors who have offered to voluntarily sterilize the bears if need be.</p>
        <p>When I was in Paramus recently handing out bear literature, it turned out that your article had been seen by just about everyone we spoke to. It made our work much easier because it educated them so well.</p>
