        <p>OPENED in 1955, the American Festival Theater in Stratford was for years a popular destination for school field trips and theater lovers, who enjoyed high-quality performances without having to travel to New York City. But the stage went dark for the last time in 1989, and attempts at an encore have, thus far, been unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Louis S. Burke has invested 10 years of his life in the planned redevelopment of the site, and he tries to remain optimistic about the prospect. However, during a recent tour of the Elm Street theater, Mr. Burke reluctantly admitted that, if the nearly $1.2 million still needed to complete the job isn't secured by the end of January, it will mean curtains for the project.</p>
        <p>''That's the do-or-die date,'' said Mr. Burke, a longtime artistic director and founder of the nonprofit Stratford Festival Theater Inc., the group designated by the state to redevelop the property.</p>
        <p>With about $2 million already spent on repairs and restoration work, funds have dried up and work is at a standstill, causing yet another delay in any productions at the 1,502-seat theater, where stars like Katharine Hepburn, Lynn Redgrave and Christopher Plummer have performed in years past.</p>
        <p>Most recently, a summer season announced in May that was to feature Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'' and ''Twelfth Night,'' and which would have been directed by Mr. Burke, was canceled. Keir Dullea and Rue McClanahan were among those slated to star in the productions.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Burke seemed unfazed by all this as he strolled around the theater's 14-acre property on the Housatonic River, overlooking Long Island Sound. He had announced a $180 million plan that would include two additional theaters, hotels, restaurants and shops -- creating a tourist destination -- on the site.</p>
        <p>''When you're a visionary, you get laughed at a lot,'' Mr. Burke said. He  admits his plan are grand, but believes they can get done.</p>
        <p>There are three or four ''nontraditional funding sources'' being looked into for the money to complete the renovations, he said. He would not elaborate.</p>
        <p>The state Department of Enivronmental Protection took over the property after it went bankrupt in 1982. It intended to get the theater up and running again, but the one season it was active -- 1989 -- was so unsuccessful it sought private developers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke's company, Brickhill-Burke Productions, was chosen in 1995 by the D.E.P., to redevelop the American Festival Theater.</p>
        <p>After three years of negotiating with the state, the property was handed over to Stratford Festival Theater Inc., and the group has been working on renovations toward Mr. Burke's elaborate plan ever since.</p>
        <p>However, that plan also stalled due to lack of funding, despite Mr. Burke's assertion when he was awarded the project that he had backers, with all the money needed.</p>
        <p>''But they just backed down due to a reversion clause in our contract,'' he said of those investors.</p>
        <p>According to that clause, if the theater project failed after completion, the property would revert back to the state.</p>
        <p>''No one wants to fund a project with no equity,'' Mr. Burke added. ''That's our main problem right now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke plans to ask the state legislature to remove the clause from the contract when it starts its session in January.</p>
        <p>But Senator George Gunther, a Republican of Stratford, said he is 'not as concerned with the reversion clause as he is with getting the theater up and running.</p>
        <p>''The state doesn't want to be in the theater business, so keeping the clause would only help in finding another developer if the project defaults,'' Mr. Gunther said, adding, ''You can't get the train out of the depot without an engine, and this theater is the engine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gunther, who lives within walking distance of the Elm Street property, said it makes more sense to concentrate on finding the money needed to get the theater open and a production going.</p>
        <p>''Forget about that long-range  stuff,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The existing theater has been made structurally sound and brought up to code with the use of some of the $2 million funding, which included a $1.5 million revolving line of credit from the state, said David Griffiths, the chief executive officer of Stratford Festival Theater.</p>
        <p>The building has also been made handicap-accessible, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke, who lives in a rented house adjacent to the theater property, said about $250,000 was spent on the stage area to make it ''Broadway size.'' The scenery is run by computer, thanks to a donation, he said.</p>
        <p>There is also a new heating and cooling system. ''This used to be a summer theater, so there was no real heating system for year-round use,'' Mr. Burke said.</p>
        <p>Carpeting has been installed, but the new, comfortable seats, which are supposed to make it easier to sit through a three-hour production ''without squirming,'' have not, he said.</p>
        <p>Outside, parking areas have been paved and landscaping completed, thanks to the town of Stratford, which gave a $500,000 grant to the project, Mr. Burke said.</p>
        <p>''Our thought on giving the money was to protect the asset,'' said Susan Collier, a Democratic town councilwoman whose district includes the theater. ''It was also done as a show of good faith.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Collier said there have been no formal discussions on further funding for the project by the council.</p>
        <p>Ms. Collier said the town also spent $75,000 for a feasibility study on the theater site, which indicated the revitalization was a viable idea.</p>
        <p>''We believe this is a good project that will benefit the entire town,'' said Ms. Collier, who said she is concerned about the current status of the project.</p>
        <p>''I'm remaining cautiously optimistic that everything will turn out all right,'' she said. ''Unfortunately, whatever happens there is out of our hands.''</p>
        <p>Also uncertain about the future is Bill Martin, who moved from California to work as spokesman for Stratford Festival Theater. He said he and six other remaining employees haven't gotten paychecks in about 20 weeks.</p>
        <p>''For a while, it looked like things would work out,'' he said. ''But now it looks like we've been thrown a curve.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin, who did sales and marketing in New York City for the Broadway musical ''Miss Saigon'' before moving to California, said he got a call from Mr. Burke about a year ago. ''He told me he had the funding for the project and would I like to come and work for him,'' Mr. Martin said.</p>
        <p>Nancy Finn is president of the Shakespeare Guild of Stratford, which has served as a support group to the theater since its opening in 1955. She said of the redevelopment plans, ''We have been desperately waiting for something to come of this.</p>
        <p>Yes, I'm frustrated. Sometimes I feel we've been snookered. It just kind of feels that way.''</p>
        <p>But throughout it all, she said, the guild, with its approximately 100 members, has remained faithful to the idea of supporting the project and its goals.</p>
        <p>''Over the years we have done a lot of fund-raising for the theater,'' Mrs. Finn, a guild member since the 1960's, said. ''But you can't go knocking on doors to raise money for something that doesn't exist.''</p>
