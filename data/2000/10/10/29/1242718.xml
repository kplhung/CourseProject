        <p>ADMITTEDLY I was already in a paranoid frame of mind when the referee blew the opening whistle for my team's soccer game against Yonkers.

        <p>ADMITTEDLY I was already in a paranoid frame of mind when the referee blew the opening whistle for my team's soccer game against Yonkers. Two starters on the team I coach -- a team of 11-year-old boys from Pelham -- arrived just 30 seconds before the game, and they were late for a maddening reason: the directions our opponents gave us had a serious error.</p>
        <p>The directions told us to get off the Saw Mill River Parkway and make a left on Prospect Street. Unfortunately, there was no Prospect Street.</p>
        <p>I was assured that the poor directions were an innocent mistake. But a voice in my head whispered that maybe the mistake was intentional, aimed at throwing my team off balance. Still, I did not dare articulate that thought to the Yonkers coach for fear of seeming unsportsmanlike.</p>
        <p>In our genteel suburban soccer league, which emphasizes teaching sportsmanship, many parents consider it far worse to be unsportsmanlike than to lose a game.</p>
        <p>My sportsmanship was severely tested 20 minutes into the game when our left wing, Alex, slipped a shot past the Yonkers goalie.</p>
        <p>That put us ahead 1-0, or so I thought. But a few seconds later, the referee declared Alex off-side and canceled the goal. (An offensive player is off-side when he or she is ahead of the ball and there are not at least two defensive players closer to the goal.)</p>
        <p>The referee's call perplexed me. Just before Alex scored, Sam, our center fullback, had drilled a free kick so hard that it bounced out of the Yonkers goalie's hands. Alex then swooped in and kicked the ball into the goal. I questioned the off-side call because Alex was behind the ball, not ahead of it, when it came his way.</p>
        <p>Although I was boiling inside, I kept my mouth shut.</p>
        <p>I remembered the advice on the soccer league's Web site: ''NEVER CRITICIZE THE REFEREE.'' Yes, it was in all capitals. Explaining that the league was having a hard time finding enough refs, the Web site warned that raining criticism on refs would make even fewer people want the job.</p>
        <p>Early in the second half, several other developments stoked my paranoia and strained my sportsmanship.</p>
        <p>A Yonkers halfback kicked a ball that was snaking out of bounds near our goal, and my son Jeremy, a fullback, let it go out, convinced we would have a goal kick. But the referee awarded Yonkers a corner kick. I was shocked, but again I kept quiet.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, a nearly identical episode occurred. A Yonkers linesman kicked a shot that went out of bounds, and Sam, our center fullback, patiently watched the ball, expecting to be given a goal kick. Instead, the referee awarded our opponents a corner kick. I couldn't believe it.</p>
        <p>By now, I was thinking that maybe the ref did have something against us. Maybe, out of class solidarity, the ref was pulling for blue-collar Yonkers over pampered Pelham. Maybe he had second cousins living in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>About 40 minutes into the game, the Yonkers left wing crossed the ball perfectly, and their center forward hammered a shot that just missed our goal. ''Nice play,'' I told myself. ''We dodged a bullet.'' But the ref signaled that Yonkers was to have a penalty kick. All the Pelham parents were dumbfounded because none of us had seen a foul.</p>
        <p>I was upset because I understood that refs shouldn't award a penalty kick that could decide a close game unless there was a blatant foul. And certainly whatever happened did not impede Yonkers's play.</p>
        <p>But again, wanting to display sportsmanship, I didn't yell at the ref. My good behavior went unrewarded, however. Yonkers made the penalty kick, putting them ahead, 1-0.</p>
        <p>I couldn't believe we were going to lose this way. With eight minutes left, I saw our star center forward, Michael, sprawled on the ground, crying, hurt by an opponent who had accidentally kneed him in the chest. After a few minutes, Michael gathered himself and was ready to resume play.</p>
        <p>Ninety seconds later, Michael, clearly angry, rocketed in a shot that tied the game, 1-1. That was the final score in a game that I thought we should have won, 2-0.</p>
        <p>The game over, I diplomatically approached the ref to ask why he had given Yonkers the penalty kick. He said one of our fullbacks had elbowed a Yonkers player in the back. Dissatisfied, I said none of my team's parents had seen anything.</p>
        <p>Having tried to be a paragon of sportsmanship, I feared that the boys on my team might conclude that I was a wimp for not standing up for them. They had battled for 60 minutes on the field, and they might understandably wonder why their coach was not battling more for them.</p>
        <p>So I told the boys in no uncertain terms that I thought the ref was wrong to call back our goal and to award Yonkers a penalty kick. As for life's lessons, I could only offer them cliches like, ''Life is sometimes unfair,'' and ''It's only a game.''</p>
        <p>I, of course, congratulated the team for showing grit, for eking out a tie in the face of a string of perplexing, unfavorable calls.</p>
        <p>While driving home, I told my son Jeremy I had no idea why the ref seemed to be tilting against us.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't tilting against us,'' Jeremy said. ''He was just a bad ref.''</p>
        <p>Maybe, I realized, my 11-year-old has more sense than I do.</p>
