        <p>Logan Ross Levkoff and Louis Edward Cortes were married yesterday by Rabbi Jerome Davidson at the Plaza in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Levkoff-Cortes, 24, is a private consultant and educator specializing in adolescent sexuality. Programs she has designed have been used in various schools in Manhattan. The bride is working on a doctorate in human sexuality education at New York University. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, from which she also received a master's in education, with a specialty in human sexuality.</p>
        <p>She is a daughter of Susan and Steven Levkoff of Brookville, N.Y. The bride's father is the president of the Standard Group, which manufactures paperboard for product packaging in Jackson Heights, Queens. Her mother is a partner in the RSL Collection, a vintage jewelry and accessories company in Brookville.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cortes, 25, is a vice president and the strategic accounts manager at the Standard Group. He graduated from Amherst College, and is the son of Dr. Tara Cortes and Dr. Luis Cortes of Manhattan. The bridegroom's mother is the director of primary care and medical services at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. His father is a thoracic surgeon in New Rochelle, N.Y., and an associate professor of surgery at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y.</p>
        <p>It may sound as if the bridegroom met the bride through his boss, but it was actually Mr. Cortes's best friend who introduced them -- though matchmaking wasn't what he had in mind.</p>
        <p>In late spring 1995, the friend called Mr. Cortes, then a college sophomore, to say he was excited about having met a ''terrific woman'' and wanted Mr. Cortes to meet her also. When Mr. Cortes returned to New York for the summer, he and his friend began working the same shift as bartenders at Pat O'Brien's, a bar that was on the Upper East Side. It was there that Ms. Levkoff met Mr. Cortes, invited by her friend to come by and see the two of them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Levkoff said she and the mutual friend had gone out only once or twice and had decided they were going to be just ''great friends.'' The friend, however, harbored secret hopes.</p>
        <p>''He was still trying to court her,'' Mr. Cortes confessed, ''and I did what no good friend should do.'' He poured her a drink and chatted her up.</p>
        <p>They continued the conversation on the phone. ''After a couple of weeks, we found we were crazy about one another,'' Ms. Levkoff said.</p>
        <p>The two men, friends since the fifth grade, stopped talking. The silence lasted at least a week. Afterward, ''he kept saying, 'How could you do this?,' '' Mr. Cortes recalled. ''I kept saying, 'I feel badly about it, too. But you guys weren't really serious.' ''</p>
        <p>A year of prickly tension went by before the three of them gathered over a ''summit dinner,'' during which the friend came to terms with the fact that the couple would stay together ''no matter what,'' Mr. Cortes said.</p>
        <p>Since then, the two men have repaired their relationship. ''First he was my best friend, then my worst enemy,'' the bridegroom said. And at the wedding? ''My best man.''</p>
