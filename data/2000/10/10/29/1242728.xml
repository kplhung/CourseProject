        <p>BY most measures, Great Neck's high school students are in great shape academically, socially and economically. But for those in this wealthy enclave who might have thought their schools were immune from the problems facing schools nationwide, a student survey made public this fall has burst the balloon.</p>
        <p>The 130-question survey developed by the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (Pride, for short) seeks to measure students' involvement with drugs and alcohol, as well as the environment, in school and outside it, in which any substance abuse occurs. The Pride survey has been administered to more than seven million students throughout the country since 1982, and to 18,000 students in New York State this year, where results are used to direct state funding of local antidrug and safe-schools programs.</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight Long Island school districts conducted the survey this year. But most chose not to make the results public, and certainly nowhere was there an uproar to equal that in Great Neck.</p>
        <p>The survey, administered for the first time in Great Neck's two high schools last June and released in September, ranked the district slightly above the national average in drinking, with the percentage who reported drinking alcoholic beverages within the past year ranging from 54 percent of freshmen to 70 percent of seniors.</p>
        <p>Student drinking is not news in Great Neck, which has several programs in place to combat it. The real surprise was that 1 percent of students reported carrying guns to school, 3 percent said they participated in gang activities, 8 percent said they had gotten in trouble with the police and 33 percent said they had threatened to harm another student.</p>
        <p>The results for violence-related issues and run-ins with the law were all below national averages. But in an upscale community where 98 percent of students attend college, the mention of guns, gangs, threats and police involvement threw parents and school administrators into high gear.</p>
        <p>William Shine, the superintendent of schools, and Judi Bosworth, the board of education president, met with George Morrish, commander of Nassau County's Sixth Police Precinct. Inspector Morrish said he told them that ''some limited gang activity and some gang recruiting existed, but there are no weapons in the schools, no crimes, no stabbings, no shootings.''</p>
        <p>''We've gotten a few calls about kids talking about weapons,'' he said, ''and we've gone to their homes and spoken with their parents, but the reports turned out to be unfounded. After Columbine, you have to take these things very seriously.''</p>
        <p>Many questioned the reliability of the survey. Ava Steiner, whose son is in the 11th grade at South High, said the survey was ''incredibly flawed,'' adding: ''Even though it was anonymous, there was still fear.''</p>
        <p>''I don't want to stick my head in the sand,'' Ms. Steiner said, ''but I don't think the problems are as widespread as the report indicated.''</p>
        <p>Linda Silverstein, a Great Neck resident with one son in high school and the other in college, said, ''There are always some kids who push the envelope,'' but added: ''With so many extracurricular activities plus out-of-school activities like music, art, religious observance, travel, sports teams and SAT programs, I can't imagine that the students would function as well as they do if they're drinking as much as the survey indicated.''</p>
        <p>Some students agreed that the results had been skewed. ''A lot of students took the survey as a joke and they exaggerated and lied,'' said Amy Katz, 17, a North High School senior and co-editor of The Guide Post, the school newspaper.</p>
        <p>But Amy, a member of the school's peer drug-education program, said, ''There is definitely a high drug usage with kids in Great Neck, and a lot of kids go to clubs in the city all the time where drugs like Ecstasy are available.''</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Gleaton, a former professor of education at Georgia State University who developed the Pride survey, defended its methodology, saying that a ''lie test'' is built into the survey to detect blatant contradictions and to eliminate surveys on which contradictions are found.</p>
        <p>''Students actually like to take these tests,'' he said. ''But if they get flak from their schools and their parents, it's not uncommon for them to deny their responses.''</p>
        <p>The district wasn't taking any chances that the survey exaggerated about guns and gangs. Dr. Shine noted that some people thought ''that it was just the kids sporting with us because they saw the chance to turn the adult world upside down. But it's important not to be complacent and to think that everything is hunky-dory. Could a kid slip a gun or knife in a school bag? It's possible. If there's something we've missed, we're concerned about it.''</p>
        <p>He emphasized, however, that ''the No. 1 problem is drinking on weekends and then driving.''</p>
        <p>Randolph Ross, the principal of South High School, said, ''There was almost complacency among the kids that cast somewhat of a doubt on the total reliability of the survey.'' But he said that when he discussed the data with students in health classes, ''there was agreement on alcohol and marijuana use, and there is no question about the drug Ecstasy.''</p>
        <p>Ildi Catuogno, the health department head at North High School, said: ''Did the results surprise me? No. Did the results dismay me? Yes. What we offer kids might not be what they think is cool at the moment. Kids have easy access to these substances, and some people consider them a rite of passage in our culture.''</p>
        <p>The school system, she said, has had numerous antialcohol and antidrug programs in place for more than 10 years, for which the district receives between $25,000 and $35,000 a year from the state.</p>
        <p>Bernard Kaplan, the principal of North High School, cited a peer drug-education program in which some students sign contracts forswearing drug use, an athletic code of conduct in which team members pledge to stay drug- and alcohol-free, chapters of Students Against Drunk Driving, and Parents Decide, a program ''to raise the consciousness of parents that there's more work to do.''</p>
        <p>''It's not relevant that the survey said any of our numbers were below  national norms,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''Any drug use is of concern, whether it's for recreation or self-medication. There is a drug and alcohol problem, and anyone who says there isn't is not looking. You're competing with New York City, and parents have to be a little stronger in where they let their kids go.''</p>
        <p>He said it was necessary ''to provide places where kids can socialize, but the best inoculation against drugs and alcohol is for kids to feel good about themselves. We know that the need to rebel and grow up is universal, but we have to teach kids to be empowered to say yes to good things and no to bad things.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Catuogno said that the Great Neck schools offer dances, comedy nights, drama performances, fashion shows, athletic events, pasta parties and karaoke nights. But in spite of the recreational diversions, she said, ''We have to fine-tune our approach and ask ourselves what additional programs should be in place.''</p>
        <p>That is precisely what Chiara Diamond, a 16-year-old junior at South High School, had in mind when she collected signatures from 160 students for an alcohol-free Friday and Saturday teen nightclub.</p>
        <p>''The only real place to go is the movie theater, which becomes uninteresting after a while because kids want to go to a place where they can talk and be loud, and Gino's Pizzeria, but the only thing kids do there is stand outside and smoke and talk,'' Chiara said. ''But that gets old and boring once you've been everywhere a gazillion times.''</p>
        <p>Lily DeSimone said she thought the problems were worse than described in the survey. The Great Neck real estate agent, a former P.T.A. member whose two daughters graduated several years ago from North High, recalled hearing that ''many of my kids' friends went to school at 8 in the morning and they were already drunk or stoned. The pot that was available to them was unbelievable because there are so many kids, even in eighth grade, walking around with credit cards and $200 in their pockets, so what kick are they going to get? Not from shopping. So they look for something else.</p>
        <p>''Here, like in all affluent communities, parents want to buy a home where they think their kids are safe walking to school and even staying home alone,'' Ms. DeSimone said. Venturing candidly into a realm where real estate agents usually won't go, she added: ''So there's a lot of denial about sex and drugs and drinking, even though they're all rampant, and that creates a false sense of security and therefore real estate value stays high and homes remain in demand.''</p>
        <p>Norman Wheeler, a social studies teacher at South High, said: ''There is a small handful of parents who are somewhat careless about keeping track of their children, but the actively involved parents are trying to find a way to reach them. This community realizes the more information their kids have about alcohol, drugs and sex, the better armed they are to make intelligent decisions. But some parents want to be pals instead of parents, and they don't know where to draw the line.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Ronald Savarese is a clinical psychologist from Great Neck. ''If kids are unhappy at home and/or struggling with some form of undiagnosed adolescent depression, they are more prone to get involved with drugs and alcohol,'' he said. Noting that 5 percent of students surveyed reported that they often thought about committing suicide, he added: ''Adults can change jobs, get divorced and pack up and move to Colorado, but kids have no place to go, and feel trapped. In fact, they are trapped.</p>
        <p>''Today's generation is less secure than they appear, and much more vulnerable than many parents are willing to acknowledge,'' he continued. ''They live in a highly competitive environment in Nassau County, and they're being raised in a tremendous amount of wealth, with high expectations and pressure to excel.''</p>
        <p>Others urged parents to be more involved in their children's activities. George Rodriguez, a researcher in pediatric surgery at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, attended a recent P.T.A. meeting at South High, where his son is in the 10th grade.</p>
        <p>''It's depressing that in a school of 1,000 kids, only 35 people attended,'' he said. ''Parents are too busy with their social lives and don't spend enough time with their kids, watching what they're doing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez said that last year, the P.T.A. mailed a booklet, published by the Town of North Hempstead, to every parent of a high school student in the district. The booklet, ''Parties: No One Has The Right to Allow My Child to Drink Alcohol or Use Drugs on Their Property,'' described the illegality and legal consequences of giving alcohol to minors, including in a home environment.</p>
        <p>''But the parents didn't read them,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''Unless they're threatened by a financial fine or jail, they don't pay attention.''</p>
        <p>He cited an incident last summer in which a teenager in Manhasset was having a party and serving alcohol. When a neighbor called the police, the parents of the teenager were hauled off to jail in handcuffs.</p>
        <p>''If there were more publicity of this kind of event, people would be more aware, and hopefully, they'd watch their kids more carefully,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Silverstein said that the police blotter of a local newspaper ''gives sketchy details of local burglaries, auto thefts and drunk driving arrests, but no names are ever mentioned, and there is no follow-up on the disposition of the cases. If police are called to an open-house party, for example, I believe that regular reporting of these types of incidences would make parents more aware that there's bad behavior occurring out there, more than they think, and that not all parents are as responsible as they could be when it comes to supervising their teens.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez said: ''We have to stop the apathy. I wish I could read the minds of parents who are neglectful to see what makes them like this. We have to make more noise, maybe forcing parents to sign a paper saying, 'I care.' ''</p>
