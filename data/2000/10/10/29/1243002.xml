        <p>Less than two weeks left in the presidential campaign. Three men sit at a bar, half-watching Game 5 of the World Series, from which the local heroes, the Cleveland Indians, are conspicuously absent.</p>
        <p>Two of them press the third to say which of the candidates he likes. He hesitates. Finally he says with a loud groan, ''I guess I'm part of that undecided 4 percent, or whatever it is. What a disappointing campaign!  Both of them specialize in stretching the truth, and they're both throwing around incredible amounts of dough.''</p>
        <p>It has been that kind of autumn, full of nagging unease. Neither voters nor strategists nor candidates seem sure what to do. Take this state. Is it up for grabs or is it not?</p>
        <p>Ohio is no longer on most lists of the primary battlegrounds, where its  place has been taken by Missouri and Florida. But the presidential nominees appear unable to decide whether to give it a pass or not; with bankrolls and campaigning days rapidly dwindling, hard strategic decisions are getting harder, and confusion is rampant.</p>
        <p>Last week, Vice President Al Gore's campaign acted as if it was conceding this state's 21 electoral votes to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. The campaign's own spending on television commercials here was cut from $500,000 to $400,000, and for the second week in a row, the Democratic National Committee spent nothing. Mr. Gore, who has not been in Ohio since Oct. 4, resisted pressure from his backers to return.</p>
        <p>But the signals were mixed. David Leland, the state Democratic chairman, whose rank-and-file organization is considered dangerously shaky by many local politicians, insisted that ''a citizens' army is in place'' to deliver the state for Mr. Gore. Tim Hagan, a former Cuyahoga County commissioner prominent in Democratic politics in Cleveland, said the Gore strategists were shifting their dollars to ''those states that they have a clean shot at winning, and I don't think Ohio is on the list.''</p>
        <p>After Ed Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said ''reports of the Gore campaign's demise in Ohio are greatly exaggerated,'' Chris Matthews of MSNBC quoted Todd Webster, a spokesman for Mr. Gore's national campaign, as saying, ''Bush is going to win Ohio'' -- the kind of thing that is just not said in big-time politics, even if it is true.</p>
        <p>This week, to confuse things further, Democratic money poured back into the state. According to officials in both parties, the Democrats earmarked $895,000 for advertising here, compared with the Republicans' $803,000. Much of it went for tough, negative television commercials, with Mr. Gore accusing Mr. Bush of promising the same trillion dollars to both young and old people, and Mr. Bush asking why Mr. Gore says ''one thing, when the truth is another?''</p>
        <p>On the other side, one of Mr. Bush's top managers had expressed confidence not too many days ago that ''Ohio is a Republican lock this year,'' and Mr. Bush had not been here for weeks, either. But suddenly he shifted gears, hurriedly scheduling an appearance in northwestern Ohio, a swing region. At an airport rally in Toledo on Thursday evening, which had some of the electricity of a rock concert, he ridiculed Mr. Gore's recent assertion that he was an enemy of big government, despite proposing costly new programs.</p>
        <p>Speaking in a state where fiscal discipline is considered a cardinal virtue, Mr. Bush said of his rival, ''I know the man is prone to exaggeration, but this takes the cake.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Gov. Bob Taft commented, ''The Bush people are taking no chances here. No Republican has ever been elected president without carrying Ohio, and they take that seriously. He may even come back for a final visit just before Election Day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taft and other Republicans pictured the sudden new commitment of the candidate's time as the purchase of some political insurance.  But it could just as easily be seen as part of an elaborate cat-and-mouse game, with each nominee trying to lure the other into expending dwindling resources unwisely.</p>
        <p>''We can be competitive here, especially if Gore comes back into the state,'' said James Ruvolo, a former state Democratic chairman who is now a political consultant. ''I'm pushing that; they haven't told me yes and they haven't told me no. I'm convinced people here are taking a second look at Bush now. No question that they like him better than Gore, but they're asking, Is he smart enough for the job?</p>
        <p>''George Bush needs Ohio a lot worse than Al Gore,'' Mr. Ruvolo said. ''If nothing else, we should spend enough money to make those other guys pay for this state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has never moved close to the lead in the public polls here, which makes the rapid fluctuations in strategy more difficult to fathom.</p>
        <p>A Columbus Dispatch poll published on Oct. 1 gave Mr. Bush a five-point lead, 48 percent to 43 percent, with 9 percent for other candidates or undecided. A Cleveland Plain Dealer poll published on Oct. 21 put Mr. Bush ahead by four points, 45 percent to 41 percent, with 14 percent for other candidates or undecided.  And a University of Cincinnati Ohio Poll, released today, gave Mr. Bush an eight-point margin, 50 percent to 42 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's standing improved considerably in the course of the three debates, Mr. Taft asserted, despite early expectations that they would help Mr. Gore. Eric Rademacher, who directs the Ohio Poll, said Mr. Gore's negatives had mounted after the debates.</p>
        <p>Prof. John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron, argued that Mr. Bush was well suited to Ohio, because he reminded many people of the state's two most popular politicians, Mr. Taft and Senator George V. Voinovich.</p>
        <p>''He's moderately conservative, and he talks about running the government efficiently without being harsh to senior citizens and others with problems,'' Professor Green said. ''You might say that he's running for governor of the United States. Gore's big problem, on the other hand, is that Ohioans aren't hostile to institutions. They're not at all in a populist mood.''</p>
        <p>Although Bill Clinton carried Ohio twice, the state has tended toward the Republicans in recent years, at least partly because of major migrations from cities to the suburbs in a half-dozen major metropolitan areas here. Both senators are Republicans, as are all statewide officeholders and the majorities in both houses of the Legislature. That makes Mr. Gore's task harder.</p>
        <p>With few officeholders and little patronage at its disposal, the Gore campaign is relying heavily on organized labor, whose enthusiasm for the vice president appears spotty.  Government employees' unions,  teachers and the United Auto Workers seem solidly in his corner, but the Teamsters, as one senior union official remarked, ''aren't all that involved in this election.''</p>
        <p>One index of the Democrats' dependence on organized labor was the makeup of the Ohio contingent at the Democratic National Convention; 55 percent of the delegates were union members.</p>
        <p>Here as elsewhere in the battleground states of the Midwest, Ralph Nader is pulling 4 percent to 5 percent of the total in most polls. He made two appearances in Cleveland on Thursday, but he is operating under a handicap in Ohio: as a result of a federal court ruling, the name of the Green Party will not appear beside his name on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Branding Mr. Gore ''a coward'' and defying Democratic efforts to convince the faithful that a vote for him is a vote for Mr. Bush, Mr. Nader drew lively crowds at Cleveland State University and the City Club. A student at Cleveland State held up a placard that said, ''A vote for Gore is a vote for Bush,'' echoing Mr. Nader's contention that the major-party candidates are indistinguishable.</p>
        <p>A larger imponderable than Mr. Nader is turnout, particularly among blacks. That raises questions about Mr. Clinton: Should he come here to stump for Mr. Gore? If he did, what would be the most likely impact?</p>
        <p>One Gore strategist, specifying that he was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the campaign, said he would ''like to see Bill Clinton at 71st and Cedar in Cleveland, walking the walk and talking the talk.''  Worried about African-American turnout, Mr. Ruvolo said that he had told the White House as long as two weeks ago that the president should spend part of the last weekend of the campaign in black churches. That, he said, ''would do more to energize our base than anything.''</p>
        <p>But Robert T. Bennett, the state Republican chairman, argued that in this state Clinton appearances ''would energize our base as much as theirs.''</p>
        <p>In the Plain Dealer poll, about a quarter of the voters said they were conflicted -- they approved of the policies of the Clinton administration but not of Mr. Clinton as a man.  About half of those said they planned to vote for Mr. Gore, and about 15 percent said they were undecided. If Mr. Clinton were to emerge as a major factor in the climactic days of the campaign, several politicians suggested, it might hurt Mr. Gore among those undecideds.</p>
        <p>A series of articles last month examined four swing states -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan -- that are likely to be critical in the presidential race. This is the last of four articles revisiting the race in those states.</p>
