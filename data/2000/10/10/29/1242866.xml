        <p>Neri's Bakery Products, the 90-year-old family business, plans to add 200 workers when it completes work on its two-story building in Port Chester. The company obtained $4.9 million in financing from Port Chester's Industrial Development Agency.</p>
        <p>The bakery, which is owned by Dominick and Paul Neri, produces and distributes about 24,000 kaiser rolls and 17,000 bagels a day. Mark S. Tulis, lawyer for the village development agency, said Port Chester was not only retaining a major business, but it was also adding job opportunities for residents.</p>
