        <p>President Alberto K. Fujimori replaced the commanders of the Peruvian army, navy and air force today as the manhunt for his former spy chief failed for the fourth day in a row.</p>
        <p>The surprise changes in command came as many critics of the government accused the armed forces of protecting Vladimiro Montesinos, the former intelligence aide, whose whereabouts have been secret since he landed at an air force base in the port of Pisco on Monday morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos had fled Peru a month ago after a videotape was broadcast showing him paying a bribe to an opposition Congressman to change political parties. The broadcast forced Mr. Fujimori to call for new elections only four months after he had won re-election to a third term.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Fujimori began and took personal command of a police and military search for Mr. Montesinos. But as the search has continued without success, an increasing number of politicians and military experts characterized the maneuver as either a charade or a virtual breakdown of presidential command over the security forces.</p>
        <p>President Fujimori gave no explanation for the command changes. He said the commanders had resigned and seemed to thank them for stepping down by adding, ''There would be no authentic democratization if the armed forces and police had not made this enormous sacrifice, this enormous patriotic gesture.''</p>
        <p>Also replaced was Gen. Luis Cubas Portales, Mr. Montesinos's brother-in-law, as commander of army units in and around Lima.</p>
        <p>But some in the opposition expressed skepticism that the changes signified a final government break with Mr. Montesinos, since the new head of the army, Gen. Walter Chacon, the current interior minister, is known as a close associate of the former spy chief.</p>
        <p>The changes in command came as the Peruvian political picture became more muddled. Even as Mr. Fujimori's search for his former top aide was roundly questioned, government and opposition negotiators made several breakthroughs on Friday night that will return the ownership of two television stations to two former owners who lost their properties during the last few years after broadcasters criticized the government and Mr. Montesinos.</p>
        <p>The agreement was seen as an improvement in press freedom in preparation for a new election.</p>
