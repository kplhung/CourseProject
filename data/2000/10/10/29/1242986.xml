        <p>Karen P. Hughes, one of Gov. George W. Bush's top aides, walked into the governor's office one day in the summer of 1997 and brandished a sheet of paper.</p>
        <p>''You're leading in the poll,'' she told Mr. Bush, who had held public office for only two years.</p>
        <p>''What poll?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Aides recall that she explained that it was the first presidential poll for the 2000 election. Mr. Bush, who had much less experience in government than most state legislators around the country, was the front-runner among Republicans.</p>
        <p>For a man who had never been particularly driven by ambition, whose overseas experience was pretty much limited to trying to date Chinese women (unsuccessfully) during a visit to Beijing in 1975, it was surreal suddenly to be at the top of the charts.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he was curiously ambivalent about the prize, delaying any decision about whether to run because of concern about the high price of the presidency in terms of lost privacy and freedom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's candidacy began like a rumor, evanescent and insubstantial but growing on thousands of tongues. Partly on its own, and partly orchestrated by Mr. Bush's political strategist, Karl Rove, the bandwagon began to move: governors dropped by to pay their respects, speaking invitations poured in, policy experts and Republican gurus came by to bless the noncandidacy, and abruptly he found himself under much greater scrutiny than ever before.</p>
        <p>All this was flattering but constraining. For a man whose language when relaxed has always had a salty tinge, it was a burden to expunge four-letter words from his daily vocabulary. But he made the sacrifice.</p>
        <p>He also fretted about the distortions and misstatements that invariably swirl around presidential candidates.</p>
        <p>When a right-wing friend reproached Mr. Bush for supposedly having said ''God damn,'' Mr. Bush erupted in a string of expletives. As the friend remembers it, Mr. Bush finally cooled down and gave examples of the obscenities and vulgarities he uses, but added fiercely that he does not take God's name in vain.</p>
        <p>In his first term of office, Mr. Bush deferred discussion of a presidential run, focusing first on his re-election bid in 1998.</p>
        <p>''His basic point was, 'go ahead, we'll do reasonable things to keep open the possibility' '' of a presidential bid, Mr. Rove recalled. As a result, Mr. Bush did some travel out of the state, worked on fund-raising, and undertook a series of tutorials to learn more about federal and foreign policy. But Mr. Rove added, ''I wasn't confident at all that he would make the decision to run. I know him too well.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Bush walloped his opponent in 1998, winning 69 percent of the vote and becoming the first Texas governor elected to a second, consecutive four-year term. Once re-elected, Mr. Bush turned to the question of the presidency and began grappling with what friends say were his two main concerns: his family and his past.</p>
        <p>Friends say that his wife, Laura, and his twin girls, now 18 and beginning college, were not opposed to his running, but that they worried about what the race would mean for their privacy. The girls, the more studious Barbara and the more outgoing Jenna, already were sensitive to the impact on their lives of having a politician as father.</p>
        <p>Once in 1994, when Mr. Bush was running for governor, he went to pick up his daughters from a party. But they had forbidden him to go inside, and so, as he recalled it, he obediently waited in his car for a half-hour until they emerged on their own, even as other parents wandered in and out.</p>
        <p>On another occasion, when he was already governor, Mr. Bush teased Jenna  about phone calls from a boyfriend, forgetting that a television crew was in the house filming the decoration of the governor's Christmas tree. The footage was broadcast,  and Jenna was mortified -- and furious.</p>
        <p>All this left his family wondering what a presidential bid would mean to their lives. In 1998, the Bushes invited their friends Bob and Jan Bullock to a Christmas Eve dinner, and Mr. Bullock turned to the two girls and said, ''Your dad needs to run for president, and you all got to support him in doing this.''</p>
        <p>''Little Jenna Bush had tears in her eyes,'' Mrs. Bullock recalled. ''And the governor, too.''</p>
        <p>''Jenna replied, she just sort of said, 'So are we going to have the Secret Service following us around?' And George said, 'We can talk about that later on.' ''</p>
        <p>Friends say that Mr. Bush might have preferred to wait until 2004 before running for the presidency, to acquire more experience and give his daughters the chance to mature more. But he sometimes compared himself to a cork in a river, and he acknowledged that the currents were particularly auspicious for 2000 -- what with an open Republican field and a scandal-plagued Democratic administration -- and might not again give him the opportunity.</p>
        <p>One insight into Mr. Bush's reasoning comes from a seven-page memo sent to him on Nov. 2, 1998, on the eve of his re-election as governor. It was already clear that he was going to win overwhelmingly.</p>
        <p>The memo, faxed to him by Doug Wead, a long-time adviser, said: ''You've been struggling with the idea that running for president could 'ruin' the lives of your daughters.'' But in a section headed ''Jenna and Barbara's great adventure,'' the memo argued that a presidential bid could be an opportunity for the girls.</p>
        <p>''They would meet many of the nation's greatest heroes, some who have overcome great adversity,'' Mr. Wead wrote. ''They would be exposed to tragedy, people dying of cancer and AIDS. There is no reason why they could not come out of the campaign with poise and a knowledge of life far beyond their years,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>''You say you worry about the Secret Service following them through college. Well, that's not all bad. For one thing, your daughters will be reassuringly safe, which is the first consideration of most parents. They are not likely to get killed in an automobile accident or be murdered, which are the two most common causes of death by  teenagers. Likewise, they are not likely to be able to experiment with drugs or alcohol until they are too mature to care.''</p>
        <p>The memo acknowledges that ''the mud will come,'' but it adds that a remarkable alignment of factors made a run uniquely favorable in 2000. These included Mr. Bush being financially secure with the sale of the Texas Rangers baseball team; his high ranking in the polls; a sense among many Republicans that they needed a new leader; and a sympathy among some journalists toward conservative candidates after disenchantment with the Clinton presidency.</p>
        <p>''You have been given a great opportunity, an opportunity that has been denied to many who have sought it,'' the memo ended. ''It is a gift that has rarely been extended. It may not be extended again. Take it.''</p>
        <p>Protective of His Past</p>
        <p>Friends say that one of Mr. Bush's key reservations about a presidential bid was his past: he did not want reporters prying around in it.</p>
        <p>It is unclear just why Mr. Bush is so sensitive about his background. He has admitted having been ''irresponsible'' in a way that suggests he may have used illegal drugs, serious questions remain about how he got into the National Guard and whether he fulfilled his obligations, and chunks of his life remain rather mysterious. But plenty of journalists and Democratic investigators have been digging, and nothing particularly sensational has been proved.</p>
        <p>Whatever his reason, Mr. Bush prefers to keep a veil over his past. He did not cooperate with his two principal biographers, Bill Minutaglio and Elizabeth Mitchell, even though both in the end wrote books that in many ways are quite sympathetic to him.</p>
        <p>''He got it in his head that the Minutaglio book was going to be damaging,'' recalled a friend of Mr. Bush's who says he discussed it with him. ''All this stuff about drugs and women was out there and he thought it was going to be the focus.''</p>
        <p>Then along came a different opportunity. Mickey Herskowitz, a Houston Chronicle sports columnist and a longtime friend of the Bushes, called to propose a ghost-written autobiography of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his aides agreed, and Mr. Bush gave Mr. Herskowitz a series of interviews. But there were a series of collisions, according to a person involved in the project.</p>
        <p>The first occurred when Mr. Herskowitz suggested that the book begin with Mr. Bush's sense of a family legacy. The campaign was horrified; the last thing it wanted was to remind voters that he was the scion of a political family.</p>
        <p>The result was that in August, the campaign took over the book project from Mr. Herskowitz, and Ms. Hughes began to write the book herself. The deadline was exceptionally tight, and campaign aides say she wrote it based on Mr. Bush's speeches and her own knowledge of him. Ms. Hughes declined to comment on the book.</p>
        <p>Just a single paragraph recounts how Mr. Bush's daughter Barbara lost her stuffed dog, Spikey, while visiting her grandparents. It adds that Vice President Bush spent the night roaming the residence looking for Spikey, even though it was the middle of his presidential campaign and he had a presidential debate the next day. The paragraph relates that Grandpa Bush persisted until he found Spikey, enabling little Barbara to sleep peacefully.</p>
        <p>It is a charming story. But it also seems to be riddled with about as many errors as a paragraph could contain. According to a 1990 account of the same incident by the governor's mother, Barbara Bush, Spikey was a cat rather than a dog, Vice President Bush gave up after a fruitless search, Spikey was not found until the next day, and the incident happened in 1987 rather than 1988. President and Mrs. Bush confirmed through a spokesman that they did not recall that Spikey's disappearance occurred on the eve of a debate.</p>
        <p>Much of the ''autobiography'' is so meager and bears so few of Mr. Bush's own fingerprints that to some reviewers it simply underscored his lack of depth. As the Amazon.com review said: ''George W. has been labeled a lightweight by some; 'A Charge to Keep' will do nothing to dispel that notion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush agreed to give two interviews for this series of biographical articles. And although he is normally charming, there were times when he bristled over questions about his past.</p>
        <p>Asked about his high school grades, for example, he said: ''I don't have any idea. So go pilfer the files like somebody else did back East.'' (He was referring to the leak of his Yale grades to The New Yorker.)</p>
        <p>''I'm sure it's discouraging to you,'' Mr. Bush said later in the same interview, in April. ''But it's not my favorite deal to talk about myself. So I'm sitting here trying to figure out what the heck you're going to write. And generally it's not anything I like to read, so it's kind of an awkward moment for both of us.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough assignment, I know, particularly since I've been -- I guess there's going to be a jillion of profiles written. But it's not as if you're breaking a lot of new ground, unfortunately in your case, which makes me even more nervous because you'll try to break ground.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush paused and added sourly: ''Not really.''</p>
        <p>Standing by His Principles</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush may not always impress people with his depth, he does convey a certain solidity.</p>
        <p>He has avoided scandal and is more willing than many candidates to tell audiences what he thinks rather than what the listeners want to hear. Likewise, for all his success in raising campaign money, he never turned the governor's office into a funds factory.</p>
        <p>While he invited many people to sleep over in the Texas governor's mansion, just as President Clinton did at the White House, there is no sign that the Texas visits were rewards for campaign contributors.</p>
        <p>A list of the 533 overnight guests in the governor's mansion during Mr. Bush's administration, obtained after requests through the Texas public information law, shows that the Bushes typically had 5 to 10 overnight guests a month. But overwhelmingly they were old family friends or relatives, like Laura Bush's Southern Methodist University sorority sisters.</p>
        <p>Some invitations apparently had a political motivation, for the guests included potential rivals, like Steve Forbes and Lamar Alexander, along with various governors and members of Congress. The guests also included some major financial contributors.</p>
        <p>But many were people of modest means who clearly were treasured simply for their friendship. The most frequent visitors of all were people like Jenna Welch, Governor Bush's mother-in-law; Debbie Stapleton, Mr. Bush's cousin, and her husband, Craig Stapleton; Mike and Nancy Weiss, old friends from West Texas; Pam Nelson, a sorority sister of Laura Bush's and still one of her closest friends; and Joe and Jan O'Neill, old friends in Midland who introduced George and Laura Bush to each other.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has been criticized for appointing buddies and financial supporters to important positions in Texas, and for going to bat on behalf of corporate tycoons who contributed to him. But while detractors argue that this is unseemly, it is not the stuff of conventional scandal.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Bush's speeches and correspondence -- obtained after requests under the Texas public information law -- suggested that Mr. Bush had core principles that went beyond political expediency. In speaking to Republican groups during the early primaries, for example, Mr. Bush routinely suggested that ''the hardest job in America'' was that of a single mother.</p>
        <p>Such lines puzzled conservative audiences and seemed to come from his heart, not his pollsters.</p>
        <p>In early 1998, there was tremendous pressure on Mr. Bush to grant a reprieve to Karla Faye Tucker, a murderer who had later married a prison chaplain and become a born-again Christian. Mrs. Tucker appeared so remorseful and so pious that conservatives who usually supported the death penalty called loudly on Mr. Bush to grant a reprieve, warning that his presidential bid would suffer if he did not.</p>
        <p>Among the correspondence obtained under the Texas law is a fax to the governor from Mr. Wead, the former aide who also wrote the memo urging Mr. Bush to run for the White House. Mr. Wead, who has been a link between Mr. Bush and evangelical Christians, began:</p>
        <p>''My fax machine has been running all night. The phone rings as soon as it is cradled. Anger and fear over Karla Faye. Great sadness. Deep emotion. This one is going to stick to you.''</p>
        <p>''You are losing the Robertson crowd over this,'' Mr. Wead added, referring to supporters of Pat Robertson, the Christian leader and former presidential candidate. ''Impact Iowa.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wead warned: ''You must have evangelicals to win the Republican nomination,'' and he added as a conclusion that going ahead with the execution would mean: ''You don't look tough, you look insensitive. Grant the thirty-day reprieve. Gauge the reaction. Move on from there."</p>
        <p>A notation on the memo reports that Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Wead after receiving it, but the content of the conversation is not disclosed. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush was getting similar pressure at closer quarters. A family friend says that Mr. Bush told him that two days before the scheduled execution, his daughter Jenna dropped her fork dramatically on her plate at dinner and announced that she was against the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not bend. He refused to grant a reprieve, and Mrs. Tucker was executed by lethal injection.</p>
        <p>Grounded in Family Matters</p>
        <p>What does Mr. Bush's biography add up to?</p>
        <p>He emerges as a bundle of contradictions: a man of immense people skills and limited policy interest, a candidate who excels at the sport of politics but is detached in the business of governing, a deep skeptic about the role of the government that he now seeks to lead.</p>
        <p>In almost six years as Texas governor, Mr. Bush is credited by most Democrats as well as Republicans with having been an effective leader who made good appointments. But these have been six smooth years when he has been able to ride a rising Republican tide and a strong economy; he has not been tested by crisis.</p>
        <p>Some of the nostrums on both sides do not seem to stand up to scrutiny. Mr. Bush is sometimes mocked as a dimwit, but this seems flatly wrong. On the contrary, those who have spent time with him, Democrats as well as Republicans, agree that he is smart -- even brilliant -- in those areas that are important to him.</p>
        <p>He has an astonishing memory for faces and names, the quickest of wits, an astute talent for judging people and a tremendous recall for starting line-ups of 1950's baseball teams. If he muddles Slovenia with Slovakia and for now has trouble naming foreign leaders, it is not because he lacks the capacity but because he lacks the interest.</p>
        <p>The fairer question about Mr. Bush is not whether he has the intelligence to be president but whether he has the intellectual curiosity. He seems exceptionally unreflective, impatient with the world of ideas, uninterested in some of the nation's key political debates. Characteristically, he does not believe in evolution -- he says the jury is still out -- but he does not actively disbelieve in it either; as a friend puts it, ''he doesn't really care about that kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush comes across as someone with a personal rudder in life. His priority is his family, not his politics, and since entering public life he has avoided scandal and pandering.</p>
        <p>Yet for all his personal rudder, Mr. Bush seems to have much less of a policy rudder. He has instincts -- a ''healthy distrust'' for government, as he puts it, and an inclination to support business -- but he does not really display a fully formed ideology. Partly for that reason, and partly because he steers away from controversy, he remains something of an enigma, a work in progress.</p>
        <p>In his speech to the Republican convention, Mr. Bush criticized the Clinton administration for failing to address any larger purpose or great goals. Yet his question about the present administration -- ''to what end?'' -- could also be asked of his own campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is sometimes compared to President Reagan, and there are strong parallels in their communication skills, in their detachment from details, in their optimism about America. Yet from the start it was evident that Mr. Reagan stood for something rock solid. It is much less clear just what Mr. Bush stands for.</p>
        <p>Consider abortion.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Bush's friends are liberals who would normally vote Democratic but who are making an exception for him. They say they are confident that Mr. Bush's conservative positions reflect simply his Texas background and the need to get through the Republican primaries. If he were elected, they insist, Mr. Bush would appoint Supreme Court justices who would preserve the legal right to obtain an abortion.</p>
        <p>Other friends, such as Texas conservatives, are just as convinced that any ambiguities about the governor's policies reflect the need to get through the general election. If he were elected, they insist, he would appoint justices who would ban abortion.</p>
        <p>There is some evidence to support each  belief. In Texas, Mr. Bush has appointed moderates to the state supreme court, and they say he did not ask them about abortion. A friend remembers Mr. Bush ridiculing  campaigners against abortion in a conversation two years ago, and other family friends say that Laura Bush privately favors abortion rights.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Bush has praised Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas as his models, and both support overturning the landmark Roe. v. Wade decision that led to legal abortion. Moreover, an adviser to Mr. Bush says that the governor has privately praised Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri as potentially a great Supreme Court justice. Mr. Ashcroft, a lawyer who is one of the Senate's most conservative Republicans, takes the position that ''the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's correspondence offers few clues to resolve these kinds of uncertainties about his policies. Fundamentally, this is because the letters tend to reveal not so much policies as a person -- a governor who focused on setting a tone rather than puzzling through the thicket of issues.</p>
        <p>A striking proportion of the correspondence, for example, concerns exchanges of good wishes, suggested appointments and invitations to dinners or golf tournaments, and few of the letters evince any particular interest on Mr. Bush's part in policy. The letters -- indeed, Mr. Bush's entire life -- conjure an image of Mr. Bush's possible presidency as a gala celebration on a cruise ship, everyone convivial and happy and, indeed, no child left behind.</p>
        <p>But the larger uncertainty is simply in which direction this cruise ship of state would steer. Mr. Bush has always seemed focused more on bringing everyone together and raising their spirits than on navigating the ship itself.</p>
        <p>In September 1995, for example, Vice President Al Gore sent a ''Dear Governor'' letter to Mr. Bush, enclosing a report on reinventing government. Since Mr. Bush also embraced the idea of streamlining government, and since Mr. Gore was the likely Democratic nominee in the year 2000, one might have expected Mr. Bush to show at least a bit of interest.</p>
        <p>Instead, a scribbled notation by Mr. Bush's assistant reports: ''Gov tossed enclosures.''</p>
