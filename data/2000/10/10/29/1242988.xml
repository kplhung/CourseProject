        <p>Six janitors who clean the gleaming office towers of this small city are in the fifth day of a hunger strike that is part of an ambitious organizing effort by the labor movement.</p>
        <p>Instead of going building-by-building to enroll the area's office janitors in groups of 30 or 40 at a time, as is customary, the Service Employees International Union hopes to sign all 2,500 of them up in one fell swoop. The union also hopes to win health insurance, convert jobs from part time to full time and realize a large wage increase for the janitors, most of whom earn $6.15 an hour, the state's minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Looking to Stamford as one of the foremost laboratories for the labor movement, officials with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. say they hope that if this organizing drive succeeds, it will become a model for a national effort to increase pay for low-wage workers and add thousands to labor's long-languishing membership rolls.</p>
        <p>Stephen Lerner, director of the union's Justice for Janitors campaign, said, ''The whole theme of what we're doing here and around the country is we want to lift janitors out of poverty.''</p>
        <p>He said Stamford was chosen as one site for this experiment because it, and much of the rest of Fairfield County, is an area of stark contrasts between rich and poor. Many low-skilled workers in the county earn less than $1,000 a month, but most two-bedroom apartments rent for more than $1,100 a month.</p>
        <p>To draw attention to the janitors' cause, the union has organized a sit-in to block traffic, sent protesters to a charity auction and run full-page newspaper ads. It has also persuaded more than 350 janitors to go on strike this week against 10 cleaning companies and 30 buildings in Stamford, Bridgeport, Norwalk and Greenwich.</p>
        <p>But many employers have attacked the union's tactics as confrontational and heavy-handed, criticizing in particular a demonstration at a building manager's house. These employers say that after organized labor long ignored the janitors' situation, it makes little economic sense to suddenly give these workers huge raises that might drive some companies out of business. Besides, some employers say, the union is seeking to defy market forces with its wage demands when a a huge influx of immigrant workers is pushing wages down for janitors and other unskilled workers.</p>
        <p>Executives with several cleaning companies said they were already paying competitive wages, adding that they feared that if they raised wages their companies might lose out in bidding for future contracts.  ''The cleaning contractors can't just sign a contract with the union and then go to the building owners and ask them to pay it,'' said Anthony Malkin, president of W &amp; M Properties, a real estate management company that strikers have drawn attention to. ''The owners will say, 'Why' and may well say, 'We're going to hire a nonunion contractor.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Malkin, who recently raised his cleaners' wages to at least $8.50 an hour from $6.15, said that in the face of the strike most cleaning contractors were using replacement workers to keep their buildings clean.</p>
        <p>The union hopes to pressure every cleaning company that operates in the county to sign the same contract so that no company can complain that it was being undercut by competitors.</p>
        <p>It has gotten prominent politicians and members of the clergy to urge cleaning companies to recognize the union and grant sizable raises. And this week the service employees began seeking to line up movie stars to visit the fasting janitors and show their support.</p>
        <p>''The janitors aren't being paid a livable wage,'' said George Jepsen, the majority leader in the Connecticut State Senate, who has urged cleaning contractors and building owners to grant higher wages and union recognition. ''Fairfield County has some of the highest housing costs in the nation, and everything else is expensive here. The janitors are paid at a level that makes it almost impossible for them to live. I haven't encountered anyone who doesn't agree that they deserve more money.''</p>
        <p>Kelley Ku, a soft-spoken immigrant from Peru who earns $6.15 an hour and works two cleaning jobs -- eight hours as a full-time housekeeper during the day and four hours in an office building at night -- said she began the hunger strike last Tuesday to help organized labor succeed in its effort.</p>
        <p>''We've begun this hunger strike to achieve all that we deserve,'' she said. ''These jobs pay so little. I came to the United States with the belief that if you worked hard you would make enough money. I realize here that you may work hard, but you don't make enough money.''</p>
        <p>Union officials here hope to persuade Stamford's cleaning contractors to agree to what contractors recently agreed to in Hartford and Denver: converting many part-time jobs, usually three and a half hours a day, to full-time ones. As a result of that provision and an accompanying wage increase, Denver janitors will see their annual pay jump to $19,000 a year from $6,000.</p>
        <p>Harry Cohn, president of Service Management Group of Bridgeport, one of the companies the strikers have focused on, said that, historically, the county's janitorial business has been part time, with many factory workers taking part-time janitors' jobs at night to supplement their incomes.</p>
        <p>He and other cleaning executives argued that Stamford's office buildings were much smaller than those in New York or other major cities, making it far harder to provide eight hours of work for every janitor. And several executives said it would make little sense to provide health coverage to part-time janitors because many janitors receive such benefits in their full-time jobs -- something the workers deny.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ku said she would much prefer one full-time job at a higher wage because her current schedule allows her to see her 12-year-old daughter only after 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>''One of the big problems for many of us is we have to work so many hours that we don't have any time to stay with our children,'' Ms. Ku said.</p>
