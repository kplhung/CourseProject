        <p>Nothing fazed Steve Flesch today, not the presence of Tiger Woods or the pressure of protecting a lead.</p>
        <p>Looking for his first victory on the PGA Tour, Flesch played the third round of the National Car Rental Golf Classic like someone who had contended as often as Woods has. This was a test for Flesch, playing with Woods for the first time, dealing with the crowds and the hoopla that follow Woods wherever he goes.</p>
        <p>People would have understood if Flesch floundered. Instead, he flourished. Riding a hot putter and hitting solid shots all day, Flesch shot a six-under-par 66 and ended the third round where he began -- two strokes ahead of Woods, who also shot a 66, and in excellent position to win. Heading into Sunday's final round, Flesch was 22 under par (194) for the tournament. Jeff Sluman, who was alone in third place at 17 under, was five strokes back.</p>
        <p>Add Flesch's name to the list of lesser-known players who have elevated their games against Woods this year -- joining Bob May, who dueled with Woods at the P.G.A. Championship before losing in a playoff, and Grant Waite, who lost to Woods by one stroke at the Bell Canadian Open. Even Flesch wondered how he would react today, but he played superbly, soaking in the atmosphere and sinking important putts. If Flesch can repeat that performance Sunday, he can walk away with a special victory.</p>
        <p>''Even though I'm leading by two strokes, I know I'm not the favorite,'' said Flesch, a 33-year-old left-hander who has enjoyed a solid year with 12 top-10 finishes. ''But that's O.K. I know if I can hold my own tomorrow, I can get my first tour win, and beat the world's No. 1 player in the process.''</p>
        <p>Woods was hardly discouraged, however, shooting his 66 despite an average putting day. Woods ended his day by making a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 18, giving him added confidence for Sunday in a tournament that is only 20 minutes from his home.</p>
        <p>''I've always played well where I grew up, or where I live,'' said Woods, who is trying to win this tournament at Walt Disney World Resort for the second consecutive year and for the third time since 1996. ''Steve played beautifully, but I was just trying to get to 20 under par. I figured if I did that, I'd be in excellent position.''</p>
        <p>Flesch kept the lead because he kept making putts. After Woods pulled even with Flesch at 17 under through eight holes, Flesch birdied Nos. 9, 10 and 12 to take a three-stroke lead. Flesch made a 25-footer on No. 9, an 18-footer on 10 and a 25-footer on 12 -- tricky, severely breaking putts that even he did not expect to make. Earlier in the round, Flesch had trouble reading the speed of the greens, but once he adapted to the pace, he started knocking the putts down.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if a heavier guy was sitting on the lawn mower cutting the greens last night or not,'' Flesch said. ''But my first few putts ran way past the hole. But after a while, I kept making them. Those putts on No. 9, No. 10 and No. 12 are the kind you can't count on.'</p>
        <p>Flesch answered early questions about his nerves on the second hole. After Woods made a 20-foot birdie putt at No. 1, Flesch answered with a 20-foot birdie on No. 2.</p>
        <p>''That was big,'' Flesch said. ''It let Tiger know he wasn't going to be the only one making birdies out here.''</p>
        <p>As the day progressed, Flesch got used to the atmosphere surrounding Woods.</p>
        <p>''After he made one putt, I still had a 2-footer to make, but people started running to the next hole, a baby started crying; it was something,'' Flesch said. ''After he finishes a hole, mayhem breaks loose. But I thought the experience was great. I don't blame people for wanting to follow him. A guy who hits it that far and that straight, he's fun to watch.''</p>
        <p>Woods is also difficult to beat. Woods is seeking his fourth straight victory and has now gone 105 consecutive holes without a bogey. If he wins Sunday, it will be the 10th victory of his remarkable season, but once again, he will have to do it coming from behind.</p>
        <p>''If this golf course is like this tomorrow, anyone can shoot a 62 out here without batting an eye,'' Woods said. ''There is no wind, the greens are receptive and the fairways are wide. If you are hitting your wedges well and putting well, you can run the table. We'll see what happens.''</p>
