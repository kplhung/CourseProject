        <p>SUCH politeness. Early Friday, after the final Subway Series game, the Yankees were celebrating right on the Mets' lawn.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in one men's room on the mezzanine, guys with Mets caps were saying, ''You first'' to guys with Yankee caps. And guys with Yankee caps were saying, ''Your team played really well'' to guys with Mets caps. And the amazing thing is that everybody sounded as if they meant it.</p>
        <p>This abundance of amity would have been unthinkable in the ancient past, 50 years ago, which was the living subtext of the last 10 days, now over.</p>
        <p>Everybody of a certain age kept waiting for the Squareheads to start clubbing the Roundheads, the Blues to start firing muskets at the Grays. Glowering opponents like Jackie Robinson of the Dodgers and Alvin Dark of the Giants and Billy Martin of the Yankees were expected to materialize, spikes high, while their fans went at it in the stands.</p>
        <p>We all need to face the fact that it's just not like that anymore. Oh, there has been considerable badinage about the Yankees' 467th consecutive world championship, but most of it has been good-natured, and -- if you can imagine this from Yankee fans -- even containing a glimmer of humor.</p>
        <p>One reader, Fernando Cruz, sent me an e-mail message he had received from a friend: ''We claimed that ramshackle, tumble-down, blue-and-orange, sewage-infested eyesore for the Bronx Bombers last night. No longer Shea Stadium -- Yankee Stadium East.'' I wrote back and said that every word looked right to me, and that Mets fans would just have to live with it.</p>
        <p>My own theory on this strange display of sportsmanship is that there was too even a distribution of Mets and Yankees fans to permit normal New York ballpark bullying. We've all seen the carnage in the outer reaches of either New York stadium when some hapless tourist ambles past wearing a Red Sox cap or a Braves cap.</p>
        <p>That stuff works when the odds are 99-1 in your favor, but at Shea it was a whole lot closer to 7-2 while at Yankee Stadium it was 20-1, still low enough odds that a knot of Mets fans might be able to handle themselves in a melee. So just about everybody behaved.</p>
        <p>By all reports, the city held up quite well, which should not have been such a big surprise, because New Yorkers put up with far more pressure than a silly sporting event. They've got crowded sidewalks, dwelling prices driven out of sight by the yuppie infestation, bad subways, bad schools. They were not about to scuff up their knuckles over millionaires in the Bronx playing millionaires in Flushing.</p>
        <p>Besides, the intimacy of television has made all these players familiar to the general population. It was easy for fans to boo a young Mickey Mantle for his strikeouts, because all we saw was the reddish sizzle up the back of his neck when he struck out. Now, what with all the camera angles and the MTV-style coverage of sports, these guys are more than real.</p>
        <p>It is not a good idea for a Mets fan to boo Derek Jeter. First of all, the guy plays shortstop and hits like a dream. Secondly, any Mets fan who shouts, ''Jeter, you stink!'' is in danger of being shunned for a very long time by his wife or girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Even a clod like Roger Clemens could not induce civil war on the subway. Sure, Mets fans may have wanted him hanged from a yardarm for slinging that jagged piece of bat near Mike Piazza. But that wasn't the fault of Yankee fans -- or even of the other Yankees.</p>
        <p>Some journalists wanted Joe Torre of the Yankees to excoriate Clemens for his action, but Torre's careful body language and indirect anecdotes spoke the subtle message. Torre reminded everybody that he and Jeter had both been annoyed with Clemens when the guy pitched for other teams. Torre basically said, hey, he's a jerk -- but he's our jerk. He just didn't spell it out.</p>
        <p>Clemens wasn't worth fighting over. Sports are not worth fighting over. These people are all stars. Jordan. Gretzky. Keyshawn. Piazza. Tyson. Venus and Serena. Jeter. Not only that, but ultimately they are all free agents. What's the sense of rolling in the gutter with your neighbor over whether Hampton or Clemens would have won the sixth game? They're both mercenaries, here today, maybe gone tomorrow. And the teams are the same way. Two of the teams that ignited fightin' passions in New York in the era of the Subway Series wound up migrating to California.</p>
        <p>People still care for their teams. Yankee fans were strutting Friday; Met fans were laying low. The Yankees are world champions. Baseball does not subscribe to that pompous football theory that teams that lose the Super Bowl are anonymous chumps. As John Franco of the Mets put it: ''Hey, I've been to the World Series. Nobody can take that away from me.''</p>
        <p>New Yorkers seemed to understand that the Subway Series was neat. Even with the huge advantage of New York cable television money, there is no guarantee that there will be another Subway Series next year. (That is to say, the Yankees will be back, but the Mets have no surety.)</p>
        <p>It was fun to see Piazza against Rivera, Leiter against Williams. But roll around in the gutter for George Steinbrenner and the dysfunctional Met owners? Getouttaheah. We've got more smarts than that.</p>
