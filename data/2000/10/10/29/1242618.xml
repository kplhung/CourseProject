        <p>One peculiarity of this political season is that we don't have Newt Gingrich to kick around anymore. Wasn't it only two years ago that he was marshaling his armies like a silver-haired Napoleon? Newt -- he was one of those tabloid figures who needed only a first name -- traveled to 48 states that year and raised tens of millions of dollars in a campaign that was really a crusade against a prevaricating, adulterous, untrustworthy President.</p>
        <p>The crusade, of course, failed. Today President Clinton is among the most popular political figures in America, while Newt Gingrich has a Web site and a consulting company and two nice offices in Washington. Though Gingrich was the most powerful speaker of the House since Sam Rayburn, or perhaps since Joseph Cannon almost a century ago, it's safe to predict that, unlike them, he will not have a House office building named after him. Frank Luntz, once the pollster to the Republican revolution and a Newt acolyte, says of Gingrich: ''He was the single smartest political figure of the last 50 years, and now no one seeks his advice. It's a Shakespearean tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Well, K Street is not exactly the blasted heath; and Gingrich, who has landed quite comfortably on his feet, as virtually all ex-politicians now do, says that he prefers the metaphor of Cincinnatus retiring to his farm. He's making good money giving speeches to the faithful, and he has married Callista Bisek, a 34-year-old Congressional aide, and he is devoting a good deal of his time to studying the kind of Tom Swift science that has always intrigued him. And so he is able to summon up all the requisite scorn when he says, as ex-politicians now do, ''I don't feel diminished by the absence of this city's version of importance.''</p>
        <p>Sic transit gloria mundi, as Cincinnatus might have put it. Nevertheless, Gingrich's stunning rise and vertiginous fall retrace the arc of a radical conservative movement that only a few years ago seemed about to reshape national politics and that now, at the verge of a presidential election pitting two moderate and extremely cautious men against each other, is barely a memory.</p>
        <p>A conversation with Newt Gingrich puts one in mind of that ad for stereo speakers that shows the listener being practically blown out of his armchair by a howling wind. Gingrich may be the only figure in American politics with a mind equal to Bill Clinton's, but while Clinton's years at Georgetown, Oxford and Yale polished, and to some extent conventionalized, his intellectual habits, Gingrich -- who himself studied at Emory and Tulane -- has preserved the eccentricity and unpredictable enthusiasms of a small-town autodidact.</p>
        <p>Gingrich has always said that he planned to be a zookeeper or a paleontologist before he discovered (at age 15) that he had a mission to save the world from barbarism. Gingrich's peculiar force of character comes from this combination of intellectual energy, self-absorption and missionary faith. He has one of those powerful minds that does not brook fine distinctions, which may explain why he was better suited to politics than to teaching history, his first profession. Sitting in his office, hanging on to my chair in the face of his gale-force monologues, I found myself either nodding weakly or arguing vehemently.</p>
        <p>A typical exchange ran as follows: ''In 1995 and 1996, between the unions, the Democrats and the Chinese Communists, I took 125,000 negative ads.''</p>
        <p>''The Chinese Communists?''</p>
        <p>''Where do you think Clinton got part of the money?''</p>
        <p>''Isn't that pretty indirect?''</p>
        <p>''O.K.; between the illegal foreign money from Buddhist monks and others, the illegal American money, the unions and the Democratic Party. . . . ''</p>
        <p>I was, of course, accepting the premise that Gingrich had personally been the target of 125,000 negative ads.</p>
        <p>It's easy to forget, now that he has gone into eclipse, but this eccentric and voluble figure pulled off one of the great political feats of the last half-century: he united the traditional party of the establishment behind an incendiary language scarcely heard in Washington since the days of Pitchfork Ben Tillman, and then, in 1994, led the party to its first majority in the House of Representatives in 40 years. And in their first 100 days in office, Congressional Republicans rammed 9 of the 10 planks in their Contract With America through the House. For a brief period, power had shifted from the White House to the Congress, and specifically to the office of the speaker of the House.</p>
        <p>But this was, as we now know, an amazingly brief period, for in late 1995 the Republicans forced a shutdown of the government over their demand for a balanced-budget bill, thus sacrificing forever whatever moral advantage it had gained over the president.</p>
        <p>I asked Gingrich if the shutdown had been the G.O.P.'s Waterloo, as conventional wisdom has it. ''I run this game film in my own head constantly,'' he said. ''If we had come in more reasonable, we would have been sucked into the city, we would have been negotiated into normalcy, like George Bush in 1990. You could see them gradually being absorbed into the Democrats, into 'This is reality; how can you fight reality?' ''But was the shutdown necessary? Gingrich conceded that it was a disastrous miscalculation; but it was a halfhearted concession. He added, ''It was really important to take a former minority party that did not have the habit of leading and get it really intense about taking on the president and forcing the budget and forcing him on welfare reform.'' Gingrich told me that when he related our conversation to John Kasich, head of the House Budget Committee and a key negotiator in 1995, Kasich said that he believed the president would never have signed a balanced-budget bill in 1997 if the Republicans hadn't already proved their willingness to jump off a cliff over the issue. In other words, it wasn't a mistake at all.</p>
        <p>You won't find too many Republicans willing to buy that, but there can't be much doubt that in the mid-90's the party succeeded in shifting the center of the debate significantly to the right. The reappearance of Dick Morris in the White House in the spring of 1995 and the president's famous statement in his 1996 State of the Union address that ''the era of big government is over'' testify to the enormous influence wielded by the Congressional Republicans.</p>
        <p>Looking back at that time, Robert Reich, the former secretary of labor and the leading liberal inside the Clinton White House, says, ''The point of least resistance was to move toward the way Newt Gingrich looked at the world.'' Reich points out that when President Clinton said that he would ''end welfare as we know it,'' he meant that he would increase funds for job training and health and child care for welfare mothers to ease their transition to work; the bill he signed, with its stringent time limits, represented the Contract With America's version of welfare reform, though he was able to moderate the bill's effects in subsequent legislation.</p>
        <p>The same is true with the idea of a balanced budget. The Clinton administration arrived in the White House believing that while it was important to reduce the deficit in order to stimulate the economy, there could be no justification for the drastic cuts in spending that would be required to erase it altogether. But, as Gingrich says, ''Dick Morris convinced Clinton that we represented the majority of the American people on the core values.'' Or, rather, Morris convinced the President that the majority wanted a balanced budget, whatever the cost. In 1997, the president signed a bill promising to eliminate the deficit by 2002 and incorporating a cut in capital gains taxes that the Democrats had long opposed. Clinton won the political battle, but the new budgetary policy came from the Contract With America.</p>
        <p>What Gingrich still cannot bring himself to acknowledge was precisely how transitory, and how ruinous, that triumph turned out to be. The government shutdown was part of a far larger campaign to delegitimize government itself and to discredit the liberal culture that had sustained the big-government idea. This was the barbarism that Gingrich had promised to rout. ''People like me are what stand between us and Auschwitz,'' he said in 1993, when the Republicans weren't yet in power, and so Gingrich was saying anything that would get him in the papers or on TV. ''I see evil all around me every day.''</p>
        <p>And since the Democratic Party was the partisan expression of that liberal culture, the culture war and the political war were one and the same. Gingrich surrounded himself with Sun Belt figures like Dick Armey and Tom DeLay who shared his passions. And they failed, because the American people did not in fact hate government, or the Democrats, or even the liberal culture. Not only did Clinton win the battle of public opinion, but on all those issues that had to do with personal values and cultural choices -- abortion, gay rights, school prayer, even the despised National Endowment for the Arts -- the G.O.P. made virtually no progress. And these failures culminated in the fiasco of the impeachment battle.</p>
        <p>Gingrich views impeachment as yet another crusade that had to be waged no matter the outcome. (This yen for the heroic but fruitless campaign may constitute the perfect proof that Gingrich was more suited to insurgency than to leadership.) ''Neither our base nor our principles would have tolerated giving the President a pass on perjury,'' he says, referring to the deposition in which Clinton said he did not have a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Gingrich says that he found it ''astonishing'' that leading Democrats simply rallied to the president's side, while during President Nixon's impeachment drama prominent Republicans like Howard Baker ''put their country ahead of their party.'' When I pointed out that few Democrats considered Clinton's misdeeds commensurate with Nixon's, Gingrich said, ''The question is, What do you think the precedent is of allowing a sitting president to lie under oath to a federal judge and a federal grand jury, and whether you think as a precedent for the future that moves you a step closer to Nigeria and Indonesia.'' Here was a characteristic Gingrich rhetorical device: a question that mutated into its own answer.</p>
        <p>But hasn't Gingrich sacrificed the right to moral grandstanding? After all, at the time of the impeachment he was himself conducting an illicit affair with Callista Bisek. I asked Gingrich as much, and he shot back, ''I wasn't lying under oath.'' It was clear we weren't bantering anymore. ''I've been through two divorce depositions in my life,'' Gingrich said grimly, ''and I told the truth both times, because you swear to tell the truth.''</p>
        <p>''All I mean is -- ''</p>
        <p>''I just told you what I mean.'' It was about truth, not sex.</p>
        <p>Of course, Gingrich is on shaky ground here too, since in 1997 he was reprimanded by the House and fined $300,000 for furnishing false testimony in an ethics case instigated against him by House Democrats. But Gingrich has always taken the position that he merely accepted assertions from his lawyers that turned out to be false; and while he is a fiery absolutist when it comes to his enemies, he permits himself the latitude of fine distinctions. He considers himself a victim of partisan politics; he considers President Clinton an unprincipled liar and a threat to national security. ''A leader about whom you never know anything in terms of the truth,'' he says solemnly, ''is a very serious problem in a free society.''</p>
        <p>Gingrich does concede that he made a serious misjudgment about public opinion. The G.O.P. made the 1998 campaign a referendum on Clinton's behavior because they genuinely despised him and because their base demanded it; but they also believed it would sell. In the end, the public's repudiation of the moralistic view of Clinton was of a piece with its repudiation of the Republicans' fixation with private choices and private behavior. Among Gingrich's own miscalculations was the decision to release quickly the 453-page Starr report, the seamy details of which wound up turning the public not so much against the president as against Starr and Gingrich and the Republicans.</p>
        <p>And what did he learn from all this? ''I realized,'' Gingrich says, ''that I was out of sync with the culture. This is a culture that is much more open, and has gone through many more experiences, than a person of my age and my background understood.'' Of course, given the experiences Gingrich himself has gone through, this may be just a trifle disingenuous.</p>
        <p>If he hadn't stepped down after the disastrous 1998 election, Gingrich probably would have been defenestrated by his party. He had alienated both conservatives and moderates, and he had far surpassed Jesse Helms as the Democrats' designated effigy. One is left to ponder the man's tragic flaw, in Frank Luntz's overheated language. Luntz accuses Gingrich of ignoring prudent advice -- that is, his own -- in favor of the warlike counsel he received from his chief political adviser, Joe Gaylord. But this is like blaming Dick Morris for President Clinton's ''triangulation.'' The underlying point, as Luntz himself recognizes, is that though Gingrich was in many ways a brilliant strategist, he continually made the kind of tactical miscalculations that come of zeal. Dan Meyer, Gingrich's former chief of staff, says: ''Newt just couldn't help himself. He got in front of a rabid partisan crowd, and they just loved his red meat.''</p>
        <p>In his 1998 book, ''Lessons Learned the Hard Way,'' Gingrich recalls that Ronald Reagan had refused to force a government shutdown of his own, saying, ''I wear the white hat, and the man in the white hat doesn't force that kind of crisis.'' Gingrich says he forgot about that lesson, but the truth is that he lacked Reagan's blithe confidence -- the confidence born of all those B movies -- in the power of the white hat. Gingrich was all too prepared to wade through blood to victory. He could not control the passions he aroused, and so, like Trotsky or Danton, he was consumed by the revolution he had fostered.</p>
        <p>And yet Gingrich clings to the metaphor of Cincinnatus, the emperor who stepped aside after bringing peace to Rome. After our second conversation, he sent me an e-mail message, titled Cincinnatus Versus Shakespeare, that suggested I list ''the MINIMUM things'' he deserves credit for and helpfully included his own minimum list -- tax cuts, welfare reform, balanced budget, ''working to strengthen our intelligence and military capacities,'' etc.</p>
        <p>What, in fact, is his legacy? It's an open question whether the affirmation of many of the party's economic principles is a greater or lesser phenomenon, historically, than the rejection of its cultural agenda. And even the budgetary victories may prove transitory, for the surplus has made fiscal restraint at least momentarily superfluous. On the day of one of my conversations with Gingrich, The Washington Post carried an article headlined, ''Spending Floodgates Open on Hill.'' Republicans, it seemed, were now vying with the Democrats to burst the spending caps that had been one of Gingrich's proudest achievements. When I pointed out to Gingrich that the revolution seemed pretty short-lived, he said, ''How long is the Progressive Era? Nineteen-ten to 1915.'' Sic transit, indeed.</p>
        <p>Would a victory by George W. Bush consolidate the legacy of 1994? Bush p re was the embodiment of the anodyne country-club conservatism that Gingrich and his allies abhorred. But Gingrich insists that the son would be a worthy carrier of the ''opportunity society'' vision, and he reels off the elements of the conservative credo in George W.'s platform -- school vouchers, Social Security privatization, tax cuts, faith-based volunteerism. On the other hand, Bush avoids the use of the ideologically loaded word ''voucher,'' and his proposal for a deep tax cut has seemingly aroused no more enthusiasm than the one that the Republican right more or less forced on Bob Dole in the 1996 campaign. A Bush spokesman confirmed that Bush's campaign strategist Karl Rove has known Gingrich for many years, and ''occasionally visits with him'' to discuss matters of policy. But Bush himself never mentions Gingrich's name, and is practically running against his own party's Congressional leadership, as Clinton pretty much did in regard to the House Democrats in 1996.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, newt gingrich is working on the next paradigm. Gingrich has, of course, always been in the paradigm business. Twenty years ago he was talking about the shift from ''the liberal welfare state'' to ''the conservative opportunity society.'' The light, Reaganesque side of him dwells in a sunlit future, a visionary landscape in which man's creative powers are given free rein. Now that he no longer has armies to deploy, Gingrich can devote his energies to bringing this world into being. Visitors to his Web site, Newt.org, can find, in addition to a collection of press clippings, information about Max Tax, Gingrich's proposal to cap federal, state and local taxes at 25 percent of any individual's income; Social Security Plus, Gingrich's proposal to partly privatize Social Security; and the Age of Transitions, a 32-page paper in which Gingrich calls for a new politics based not on the traditional distinctions of left and right but on the need to address a world transformed by technological change. Gingrich suggests that only the most dramatic proposals will re-engage an electorate now busily pursuing the private satisfactions available in this new world; the first two big ideas he suggests are Social Security Plus and Max Tax.</p>
        <p>Like George Gilder, the entrepreneurial evangelist turned futurist, Gingrich believes that free markets and new technology will transform the world. Years ago, Gingrich was fascinated by space; one of the few agencies he never wanted to cut was NASA. But space was a dud in regard to civilian applications, and Gingrich has since moved on. He now spends a good deal of his time learning about advances in medical care, information technology and nanoscience, which studies processes and seeks to build devices at the level of the individual atom or molecule. He has been to Georgia Tech to talk about quantum mechanics and to M.I.T. to talk about the ''nanoworld,'' and he recently met with three neuroscientists at Berkeley who invented an incredibly successful reading system using an M.R.I. scanner. ''It's a little bit like Lewis and Clark,'' he says giddily. ''There's a whole continent out there.'' Gingrich has the kind of all-American optimism that requires wide-open spaces, even if figurative ones.</p>
        <p>Gingrich is unlikely to make a dent in the debate over taxes or Social Security, but he may well have an influence on the more obscure field of science policy. He argues, for example, that we need to place far greater emphasis on math and science education than we have in the past. ''If you don't have the breakthroughs in math and science,'' he says, ''you will not produce the people in America for the next generation to lead us, and we will not lead the planet for 20 more years. We're like Britain in the 1870's and 80's, when their culture couldn't make the shift socially to an engineering and management society.''</p>
        <p>Gingrich says that if you have to pay kids $1,000 to take calculus, then so be it. He foresees an electronic system of patient records that would prevent many accidental hospital deaths. He wants to give telecommunications firms incentives to scrap copper wire in favor of fiber-optic cable, he wants to accelerate the use of the Internet as a learning tool in rural areas and he wants to significantly increase the federal research budget. As a conservative, Gingrich would rather be compared with Teddy Roosevelt than with Herbert Hoover. ''This requires conscious thought,'' he says; ''you don't have the luxury of just opposing big government.''</p>
        <p>In late September I accompanied Gingrich to a conference on nanoscience held by the National Science Foundation. Almost everyone there had either facial hair or dubious footwear, and Gingrich, portly and immaculate in white shirt and gray suit, was perfectly at home among them, making nanochat with impressive fluency. Nanoscience is Gingrich's favorite subject. He told me that he expected it to be ''bigger than the entire 20th century'' -- which is to say, very, very big. Scientists are beginning to understand how organic processes like cancer operate at the molecular level; in coming years, Gingrich says, they hope to be able to design molecular-scale anti-cancer agents. ''You can drink three million of them with your orange juice, and they'll eat up the cancer,'' Gingrich explains. And there won't be any side effects or bad consequences.</p>
        <p>Gingrich was invited to kick off the session, and he talked about the new world that was a-borning. He spoke extemporaneously and, as usual, torrentially. ''I believe that we're actually at the edge of an age of discovery which is vastly richer than anyone understands,'' he said. Just as the steam engine and the textile mill and electricity created previously unimaginable levels of wealth in early ages, so would information technology and biology in the age that was dawning -- perhaps as much as $100 trillion this century. Nanoscience might well solve problems of scarcity and of environmental degradation. The change, he said, might be so great that the expression ''orders of magnitude'' would be too modest to express it. He couldn't quite think of an expression that would do it justice.</p>
        <p>The funny thing was that none of the scientists who spoke after Gingrich were as fervid. They all agreed that nanoscience would produce extraordinary breakthroughs, but they were full of caveats that come of hard experience. One cautioned that it might take longer than expected for changes at the level of science to reach ordinary people, while another spoke of ''the fantasy of a risk-free society.'' Lester B. Lave, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, listed innovations that had proved to be less effective or more expensive than what they replaced; William Tolles, a consultant and former Navy scientist, spoke of the danger of ''nanohype,'' and specifically of ''visionaries who have painted an unrealistic view of the future, never having been in a laboratory.'' That sounded familiar.</p>
        <p>Gingrich listened intently, and at the lunch break I asked what he had taken away from the session. Immediately he said, ''I had a 10-minute conversation with Richard Smalley beforehand which was worth the whole morning.'' Smalley, a professor of chemistry at Rice, had explained to Gingrich that fears over the possible creation of ''nanobots'' -- self-replicating, mechanical nanoscale robots -- were absolutely groundless, since this would constitute a problem in epidemiology that science could readily solve, as it had solved previous outbreaks of dangerous living organisms. Gingrich apparently found this reassuring.</p>
        <p>I asked if he had noticed the pervasive air of caution. He nodded impatiently. ''When you get a lot of scientists in a room, they tend to become psychologically correct,'' he explained. He went off on a tangent about computer companies that had been too obtuse to capitalize on big breakthroughs. Mike Roco, an National Science Foundation official, overheard us and said, ''I'm very concerned that we have to stand up against exaggeration.'' Gingrich cut him off. ''Against exaggeration on both sides,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is probably safe to say that if you wanted to enlist public figures in a campaign against hyperbole, you wouldn't start with Newt Gingrich.</p>
