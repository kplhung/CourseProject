        <p>Last July, Brooklynites flocked to the waterfront to greet 26 tall ships sailing in from around the world. But at a heated hearing earlier this month, more than 100 Sunset Park residents came together to keep an electricity-generating barge, one of 15 barge projects envisioned for the city, from docking nearby.</p>
        <p>Some residents wore gas masks and waved banners as they spoke of lower property values and higher risks of asthma. Incorporating three barges, the plant would be the largest of its kind outside the Philippines.</p>
        <p>Residents suggested that the company, Sunset Energy Fleet, had picked the 520-megawatt plant's location off 22nd Avenue because it was a low-income area occupied by ethnic minorities. They said the power produced would be used in other parts of the city, not their own.</p>
        <p>Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, whose Congressional district includes much of Brooklyn, drew applause when she told company representatives to ''pack and go home.''</p>
        <p>A permit application submitted by the company to the state Department of Public Service was deemed incomplete last month, in part because it had not finished a report on whether the area already had undue environmental burdens from industry.</p>
        <p>Currently, the city has two barge power plants, both in Sunset Park. On Oct. 18, one day after the public hearing, Community Board 7 voted unanimously to oppose the plant.</p>
        <p>In Williamsburg, a similar battle is being waged over a smaller barge proposed by a related company, New York City Energy, which applied for a permit for a 79-megawatt barge near Division Avenue, an area recently zoned residential. Deborah Masters, who lives nearby, said she and her neighbors found out about it only by accident.</p>
        <p>''The public-comment period had passed and we had to do something immediately,'' Ms. Masters said.</p>
        <p>Before the state Department of Environmental Conservation could issue a permit, residents sent in enough protests to warrant a public hearing despite the late date, said Lenore Kuwik, the department's chief of environmental analysis. Of the 15 planned barge projects, she added, only the Sunset Park and Williamsburg ones had come this far.</p>
        <p>John W. Dax, a lawyer for both companies, said they did not hold any public meetings in Williamsburg because they were not required for a plant under 80 megawatts. As for the Sunset Park plant, he said it would meet rigorous emissions standards and serve the local area for most hours of the year. In both neighborhoods, he said, the company may have erred by not talking enough with the public.</p>
        <p>''Our community outreach people are scheduling a series of meetings,'' with Sunset Park residents, he said, adding that the company hoped to complete the Department of Public Service requirements by next month.</p>
