        <p>A confident-looking Gov. George W. Bush brought his get-out-the-vote tour into Wisconsin today, calling on more than 6,000 supporters in this small town to recruit ''open-minded Democrats and disillusioned independents'' to his cause.</p>
        <p>As billowy clouds raced across the gray sky, Mr. Bush offered his shivering but enthusiastic crowd a platform of tax cuts and smaller government, while jauntily mocking his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, as an exaggerator, a big spender and a Washington insider.</p>
        <p>''He's so confident of his abilities, he claimed he invented the Internet,'' said Mr. Bush, who is known among his followers and his critics as Dubya.</p>
        <p>''But if he's so smart,'' Mr. Bush said, ''how come all the Internet addresses start with w? Not only one w, but three w's.''</p>
        <p>This was the final leg of a three-day trip that has taken Mr. Bush through five of the most closely contested states -- Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>In each, Mr. Bush has been less concerned with sounding new messages than rallying supporters for the final push to Election Day, just 10 days off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush plans to take most of Sunday off, except to deliver a videotaped address to a Hispanic group in California. He travels to New Mexico and California on Monday, and to Oregon and Washington on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>At today's event, held in a minor-league baseball stadium in this town west of Green Bay, Mr. Bush was accompanied by Governor Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and his vice-presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, who asserted that eight years of neglect by the Clinton administration had left the military dispirited, overextended, poorly equipped and unprepared.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney said that when he served as secretary of defense under Governor Bush's father, President George Bush, he had thanked former President Ronald Reagan for strengthening the military.</p>
        <p>''I don't think any future secretary of defense is ever likely to call Al Gore and Bill Clinton and thank them for what they did to the U.S. military,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After the rally, campaign workers released hundreds of red, white and blue balloons, while fireworks exploded overhead, disgorging small American flags attached to parachutes.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of using Halloween tactics to scare senior citizens about the Republican's plans for Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has called for allowing taxpayers to invest part of their Social Security taxes in private accounts, and for using federal subsidies to encourage private insurers to provide Medicare coverage. Mr. Gore contends that Mr. Bush's proposals would lead to cuts in Social Security benefits and inadequate health care for the elderly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also asserted that Mr. Gore had not fulfilled campaign pledges in 1992 and 1996 to fortify Medicare.</p>
        <p>''He says you ain't seen nothing yet,'' Mr. Bush said, mimicking one of Mr. Gore's favorite lines. ''And we say, 'You bet, Mr. Vice President, we haven't seen anything yet when it comes to Medicare.' ''</p>
        <p>On several occasions, Mr. Bush mentioned President Clinton, drawing lusty choruses of boos each time. ''Make no mistake, my opponent is a formidable candidate,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He's got the president getting ready to campaign for him.''</p>
        <p>And in what clearly seemed like a reference to Mr. Clinton's affair with a White House intern, Mr. Bush told the crowd, ''The best ally a family will have is a president who behaves responsibly in office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has repeatedly accused Mr. Bush of representing the interests of the rich and powerful, and Mr. Bush has responded by injecting a dose of populism into his speeches, as was evident again today.</p>
        <p>The governor described himself as ''standing on the side of the working people.'' He ridiculed Mr. Gore for having lived in Washington too long and thereby losing touch with common people.</p>
        <p>And he derided Mr. Gore for saying that he would give ''targeted'' tax cuts to ''the right people'' -- a phrase Mr. Bush said demonstrated an arrogance and elitism on the part of the vice president.</p>
        <p>''That's not our vision for America, folks,'' Mr. Bush said. ''See, we're one nation under God, indivisible. We're all the right people in America.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Bush has stopped holding news conferences and rarely walks to the back of his campaign plane for informal, off-the-record chats with reporters.</p>
        <p>But he continues to banter from a distance with reporters. And with many tracking polls showing him pulling ahead, he has displayed an air of confidence each time he does so.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Mr. Bush light-heartedly traded hand signals with reporters, first flashing a ''V'' for victory sign with two fingers, then adding a third digit to form a ''W.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Bush tried the three-fingered wave on his Wisconsin crowd, eliciting chants of ''W.''</p>
        <p>''We're coming down the stretch, and I got to tell you, our team feels great,'' he said.</p>
