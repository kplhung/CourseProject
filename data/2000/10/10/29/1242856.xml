        <p>''Vulgar'' and ''terrorist'' are not words that spring to mind in depicting early music.

        <p>''Vulgar'' and ''terrorist'' are not words that spring to mind in depicting early music. But Andrew Manze, the British violinist and director of the Academy of Ancient Music, has seen both printed in otherwise sober articles about his style and transcriptions. In Princeton tomorrow, when the much-recorded 17-member string ensemble performs pieces from the Baroque era, listeners will have a chance to judge for themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manze earned these epithets -- or laurels -- for doing what seems right to him by way of restructuring and ornamentation.</p>
        <p>After succeeding Christopher Hogwood at the Academy four years ago, Mr. Manze delved into works of less-known composers, including those of Francesco Geminiani, a pupil of Archangelo Corelli. Tomorrow's McCarter Theater concert presents Geminiani arrangements of his teacher's concertos, as well as  Mr. Manze's own transcriptions.</p>
        <p>The ensemble, which performs while standing, is still standing, and judging from its two new releases on Harmonia Mundi, the program will have the kind of vulgar Baroque terrorism you can listen to for hours.</p>
