        <p>IT'S Queens circa 1960 every night at Stella, a time warp ristorante in Floral Park on the Nassau-New York City line. The songs of Frank Sinatra and Italian opera divas fill the air, the celebrity pictures of past patrons (everyone from Mayor W. Rudolph Giuliani to Joe Pepitone of the Yankees) hang on the bar-room walls, tuxedoed waiters, some of whom have been at Stella for 20, 25 or 30 years, scurry about and the menu lists every known mainstream Italian dish.</p>
        <p>This warm, wonderfully retro restaurant, with its hanging Tiffany lamps, conventional landscape art, red and black banquettes, antique-filled breakfront, flowers, floral carpeting, ornate vases and beamed ceiling, celebrated its 40th anniversary last week. Stella and Guiseppe Cerrone, now 82 and 93 years old, respectively, opened a modest pizzeria in 1960 that over the years became the big deal, white-tablecloth restaurant at 152 Jericho Turnpike (516-775-2202).</p>
        <p>They still can be seen presiding over this family owned and operated enterprise, along with their son, four daughters, a cousin and two brothers-in-law who hold down key posts.</p>
        <p>Listen to the many regulars talk among themselves and between tables and know that the Stella Ristorante is as traditional as they come and is proud of it.</p>
        <p>''We're going to be married 42 years next month.''</p>
        <p>''Remember Johnnie Ray singing 'The Little White Cloud'?''</p>
        <p>''Did you know that Kate Smith used to eat here?''</p>
        <p>Stella's food is robust rather than refined. It stresses not cutting-edge surprises but large portions of reassuringly old-fashioned dishes at modest prices (39 of 46 entrees cost $8.95 to $18.95, a majority of which are $9.95 to $16.95). Think parmigiana, Bolognese, oreganata, Marsala, piccata, Milanese and alla vodka.</p>
        <p>Stella Ristorante is full or nearly full even on most weeknights. Their kitchen and wait staff is under relentless pressure. That means a bus boy clearing only half of the dirty dishes before rushing off to another table, occasional lapses in service, the presentation of one dessert menu for four diners, the white meat in the chicken scapparella being overcooked, dishes that sometimes arrive lukewarm or servings of bread or fried zucchini sticks that are ever so slightly burned.</p>
        <p>But an eating place that survives and prospers for 40 years in a volatile, competitive restaurant-rich area like Long Island must be doing something right, and if Stella is short on finesse, it's long on flavor and friendliness. Most of its renditions of Italian golden oldies remind us of why these dishes are mainstays.</p>
        <p>Dinners begin with stacks of warm focaccia triangles. Salads are huge; the extraordinary greengrocer-fresh tricolor ($5.95) is especially recommended. Every pasta sampled scored, from a simple rustic tagliatelle filetto di pomodoro ($11.95), or homemade noodles in a rich prosciutto-laced tomato sauce, to an immense bowl of paglia e fieno ($11.95),  homemade green and white pasta thick with onions, garlic, peas, mushrooms and generous strips of prosciutto, covered with a lively red sauce. Linguine Bolognese ($9.95), heavily sprinkled with pebble-size meat over al dente pasta, is a husky winner. Even the usually bland marinara sauce that covers the spaghetti sides served with entrees is a cut above average. A hearty special -- rigatoni with big slabs of pot-roast-like veal and many, many mushrooms in a brown sauce ($14.95) -- also delivered plenty of kick, but the pasta at the outside of the dish was barely warm.</p>
        <p>Stella's sausage roll ($4.50), an egg roll-like starter stuffed with meat, spinach, cheese, onion and pimento, suffered a similar fate. Not so for a casserole dish of escargot, swimming in a delightful mushroom-studded garlic-butter sauce. Half portions of pastas (which would be entree-size elsewhere) should also be seriously considered as starters.</p>
        <p>Many main course picks are a pleasure. Among them are thick, tender, winey veal Marsala ($17.95) cooked to perfection; moist chicken breast covered with mushroom-wine sauce and stuffed with a savory meld of meat, cheese, spinach and breading ($14.95); and a fillet of sole ($18.95) packed with shrimp, crab meat and mushrooms and napped in a garlicky wine sauce. Although there is no need to splurge at Stella with so many satisfying, modestly priced picks, a special of butterflied veal chop ($26.95), which is pounded, breaded and baked, is a treat.</p>
        <p>Dessert is unnecessary too. Few will be able to cope with it after the bountiful appetizers and entrees. The conventional choices available all cost $4.95, are very large, very sweet and tend to taste a lot alike. They are however, included in a 40th anniversary three-course dinner ($40 for two) complete with a Champagne toast and souvenir glass that is available throughout November.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Sole, a modest 72-seat Italian restaurant in Oceanside owned by Joseph Bonacore, formerly the chef and owner of the upscale Tuscany in Rockville Centre, and Robert Carmasino, the Tuscany's sous-chef, opened on Sept. 12. The restaurant, at 2752 Oceanside Road (516-764-3218), where Amato's had been, offers Italian finger foods for $3, bottles of wine for $20 and dishes like shrimp lemoncello, dry-rubbed filet mignon and braciola, or beef rolled around prosciutto and fontina cheese, from $8.95 to $14.95.</p>
        <p>Maxxel's Seafood Bar and Grill opened at 540 Jericho Turnpike in Mineola (516-741-7387) earlier this month. The 80-seat spot, where T. J. Poole, one of the Island's oldest bars had been, is owned by Carmelo Sapuppo, who was a captain at Le Cirque and La Caravelle in Manhattan and the owner of La Ventura in Merrick. Stuart Brown, the chef, was a sous- and executive chef at the Ritz Hotels in Boston and Philadelphia and cooked at the London Restaurant in Philadelphia. Maxxel's features four or five different oysters and three or four fish specials nightly in addition to its regular menu, which offers entrees from $16 (fettuccine Bolognese) to $24 (roasted Chilean sea bass or grilled filet mignon).</p>
