        <p>SUSAN SMITHLINE is the ringleader of a tightly knit band of tag sale aficionados that roves around the county every Saturday. Joan Gerard, a member of the band, describes Mrs. Smithline with playful reverence as, ''the one who has been going to tag sales since before there were tag sales.'' Mrs. Smithline accepts the mantle with a smile, adding that people used to laugh at her for how many tag sales she went to.</p>
        <p>''And now?'' prompts Mrs. Gerard.</p>
        <p>Nodding, Mrs. Smithline answers on cue,</p>
        <p>''They give me lists of all the things they want.''</p>
        <p>After 40 years of friendship, through good and very bad, the two women, both White Plains residents, have a rapport so fluid it sounds scripted. Along with a third friend who requests anonymity because she is convinced her daughter would be mortified if she found out how frequently she goes ''on the line,'' as Mrs. Smithline calls the tag sale circuit, the band says they go for the double joy of commerce and camaraderie.</p>
        <p>Sometimes they find a treasure, like Mrs. Smithline's mink coat, which she notes with a wry smile has the former owner's name, Roberta, still stitched inside. Other times, they won't find anything, which isn't such a bad thing because they don't have much room left in their houses anyway.</p>
        <p>Besides, they are just as happy to have lunch together and pick up a few toys, always available, for their grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Smithline explains that tag sales, like life, are a game of chance and luck. The key is to try so frequently, so thoroughly, that you eventually make your own luck. One might add that this makes tag sales a good break from life, where luck and chance are trickier, less reliable matters.</p>
        <p>In Tarrytown recently, another band, made up of Joyce Gober and Louise Davis, both of Armonk, was having one of those truly lucky days. Tarrytown was holding a townwide tag sale and for $20, you could have your house included on a list and map. Thirty houses took part, and by noon the two women had hit just shy of the total, Mrs. Davis's minivan filling up by the stop.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mrs. Davis purchased a large potted plant and put it into the back seat, where her friend was sitting. ''I feel like I'm in a rain forest,'' Mrs. Gober laughed, from between leaves and branches.</p>
        <p>Approaching the next sale, Mrs. Davis points out the window and exclaims, ''Look at that gazing ball.'' Within two minutes, she has parked, negotiated and purchased it.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gober poked fun at herself when she bought a storage container at the same sale. She said that she needs storage for all the things she has bought at tag sales, and since she's bought so much, she even needs ''storage for my storage.'' Mrs. Gober hopes to have a great big tag sale one day to sell all the things she's bought at tag sales.</p>
        <p>For her part, Mrs. Smithline does have a tag sale once a year.</p>
        <p>It was held recently at the Girl Scout House on Wayside Lane in Scarsdale. With her friends at her side, donating belongings, setting out goods and handling the cash boxes, they were doing a brisk business.</p>
        <p>The tag sale wasn't being held for personal benefit, but for the charitable foundation Mrs. Smithline holds dear. Tag sales have been such a big and enjoyable part of her life that Mrs. Smithline holds one annually for the Billy Smithline Foundation.</p>
        <p>Billy, her son, ''came back from his sophomore year at Cornell, supposedly with strep throat,'' Mrs. Smithline remembered, the joke suddenly absent from her voice. ''It wasn't strep,'' she said. It was leukemia. ''He had one bone marrow transplant and six months later . . . ''</p>
        <p>Anonymous closed her eyes. ''How long has it been?'' she asked softly.</p>
        <p>''He's been dead 15 years,'' Mrs. Smithline said, and Anonymous put a warm hand on her. ''Billy,'' Mrs. Smithline whispered, ''was a cute little guy.''</p>
        <p>Soon, the action around her made her look up. Kids were fish-tailing on big wheels, people were trying on hats and jackets and her granddaughter was nearby. All around her items were being bought, with the money eventually going to cancer research and to facilities and programs that help parents of children who have cancer.</p>
        <p>All the while, friends, family and strangers kept replenishing the makeshift shelves, dropping off bags of old toys and clothes, trinkets and collectibles. Mrs. Smithline reached out and brushed a finger over a pile of it. ''It's really all junk,'' she said quietly. ''But it is really very nice. It's all really very nice.''</p>
