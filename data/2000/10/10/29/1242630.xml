        <p>A  BROILING sun cooked the melange of cars, buses, trucks, donkey carts, mopeds and taxis as our minivan maneuvered its way out of Fez. We were headed south on Highway P-24 toward the Middle Atlas Mountains and the desert beyond. Having pampered ourselves in Fez at the luxurious Palais Jamai and tasted the exotic centuries-old flavor of the labyrinthine medina, we were off to the countryside in search of new adventures.</p>
        <p>In a country as varied as Morocco, there is plenty to see beyond the well-trod sidewalks and narrow alleyways of the imperial cities Tangier, Fez and Marrakesh. So during a family vacation to Morocco in August, we took three days to explore the south, an arid and rugged land with sandstone hills and steep-walled valleys, and whose Berber populations have at times been quite separate from the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>The drives to Morocco's south are long -- eight hours from Fez to Erfoud. And with the exception of Ouarzazate, the south's major urban center, accomodations tend to be spare, especially as you get closer to the desert. But if you're game, a trip to the south will yield spectacular vistas of ruggedly beautiful countryside and the serenity of Saharan landscapes.</p>
        <p>Getting around Morocco is relatively easy. The country has a good road network that includes superhighways, mainly in the north, and two-lane roads in the southern reaches. My wife, Marian, my 14-year-old daughter, Jenny, and I traveled with friends, a family of four from Washington. Given the size of our party and the distances involved, we hired a minivan with a driver and a guide, all for $200 a day. Split between two families that was only slightly more than renting two cars and paying roughly $3 a gallon for gasoline.</p>
        <p>About an hour outside Fez, the road lurched sharply upward, the air cooled considerably and the landscape became more lush as we entered the Middle Atlas Mountains. We drove through serene apple orchards, terraced farms and dense forests of red and green cedars, evergreen boughs etched across a blue skyline. Nestled on hillsides were mud-walled Berber houses recognizable by their low doors. According to our guide, 36-year-old Jawad Lahani, this was a vestige of ancient times, when you wanted anyone venturing inside to stoop low and be defenseless, in case it was an enemy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lahani is a slender, internationally trained economist from Fez who has been leading tours, large and small, for five years. He often remarked that Morocco was a country of sharp contrasts. If Fez resembles Morocco of the 12th century, Ifrane, with its sharply peaked red-tile roofs suggests Switzerland at the beginning of the 21st. This city, about an hour and a half south of Fez, is the center of Morocco's skiing industry and has a cosmopolitan air.</p>
        <p>When we stopped in Ifrane for a break, we wandered into a small restaurant that served sweet chocolate pastries and strong Moroccan coffee. The staff took orders in French and Arabic while the sounds of Natalie Cole crooning American ballads drifted from speakers.</p>
        <p>Back on the road, we kept a sharp eye on the forests, hoping to catch a glimpse of a troop of Barbary apes. These rare tailless macaques, about the size of small chimpanzees and found in Morocco, Algeria and Gibraltar, are reportedly highly sociable and do not shy away from human contact.</p>
        <p>Our search of the cedar boughs turned up no sign of the creatures, but as we stopped at a scenic overlook to take pictures, a brown Barbary ape leaped through the van's open door, startling everyone. She was the domesticated pet of a roadside vendor and her name was Linda. She was quite tame and jumped into the laps of several of my traveling companions, contentedly picking at them, probably looking for a succulent insect or two.</p>
        <p>We rummaged around in the cooler we kept in the back and found a banana for Linda. This turned out to be a big mistake. Happy to have found a steady source of food, she settled in, and showed no inclination of wanting to leave the van. Finally, her master persuaded her by brandishing a stick in her direction. Linda beat a huffy retreat, showing her disdain by displaying her rump in our direction as she ambled away.</p>
        <p>Coming out of the Middle Atlas Mountains, we sped along a high rocky plateau in a countryside resembling southern Utah. Rocky sandstone hills loomed in the distance and after a few hours, the Ziz River cut dramatic gorges in the high desert landscape. At the bottom of the gorges, an oasis that stretched for miles provided a welcome streak of green.</p>
        <p>We pulled into a parking lot in the dusty city of Erfoud and out of the Cafe des Dunes bounded Seddik Ettaiek, who was to be our guide for the next two days in the Sahara. Smiling broadly, he displayed stained teeth and what we soon learned was his normal sunny disposition.</p>
        <p>We left our van and piled into two rented Land Rovers. Seddik wrapped his head in a blue silk scarf and climbed behind the wheel of one Land Rover with the three children and one adult; the rest of us rode in the other with another guide, Ahmed, who wore the flowing blue robes of the Taureg people.</p>
        <p>We headed toward Merzouga, a tiny village in the southeastern corner of Morocco that abuts Erg Chebbi, Morocco's only genuine Saharan erg, or dunes. The undulating hills of sugar-fine sand rise to 400 feet and go on for miles in frozen brown waves, looking just as one would imagine when conjuring up images of the Sahara.</p>
        <p>Some guidebooks, notably Lonely Planet, suggest that you can drive yourself to Merzouga. I recommend against it. The paved road peters out about six miles outside Erfoud. The rest of the way has to be negotiated over a moonscape of black shale that covers dangerously soft sand, best left to four-wheel-drive vehicles and expert drivers. The Land Rovers cost only $50 each for two days, and that included the driver. They were worth every penny.</p>
        <p>About 45 minutes into the desert we came upon a minivan stuck up to its axles. Our drivers stopped, and with the van's driver, tried to push it and its occupants -- an elderly woman holding an infant -- out of its trap. But the van only sank deeper into the sand. Meanwhile, several other Land Rovers, each full of tourists, sped by, not even slowing down to see if they could help.</p>
        <p>Finally, someone produced a coil of rope; hardly more than twine. It seemed too fragile to be of much use. But Seddik and Ahmed fastened one end to the rear of the van and the other to the front of one of the Land Rovers. This time, Michael, the father of the other family we were with, and I put our shoulders into it. With all of us straining, the Land Rover pulling hard, and the van driver gunning his engine in reverse, the vehicle suddenly lurched free.</p>
        <p>''Ahmed,'' I said in my rusty French after we resumed our trip, ''why didn't the other Land Rovers stop to help?'' They were guides from other places, said Ahmed, who was raised in the desert, and they did not appreciate the rigors of the Sahara. ''They are not desert people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Merzouga, we hopped aboard camels and, led by guides, rode out into the dunes. The sun was setting and the temperature had dropped considerably. Except for our own voices, not a sound could be heard. We spotted a few other tourists off in the distance walking among the rolling sand hills, but for the most part, there were no other signs of life. We were enveloped by a sense of timelessness, aware that the vistas we looked at had not changed from the time when they were crossed by caravans loaded with spices, gold and indigo.</p>
        <p>We stayed that night at the Auberge Kasbah Tombouctou Hotel, a collection of adobe buildings at the edge of the dunes. The rooms were clean but basic, and, without air-conditioning, sweltering. But at $15 a person, including breakfast and dinner, the price was hard to beat.</p>
        <p>The place was also lively. Seddik, in addition to arranging and driving the Land Rovers, ran the hotel. His staff cooked a savory lamb tagine -- the classic Moroccan stew -- and he and others on the staff entertained the guests, playing drums and a banjo and singing Berber songs. Unable to resist the intoxicating rhythms, patrons, including a group of French students and Marian, were soon on their feet dancing.</p>
        <p>Exhausted, I left the party and went to bed. But sleep was impossible in the stifling rooms. So the hotel staff set up beds on the roof, where we were cooled by desert breezes and slept under a canopy of stars and an incandescent full moon.</p>
        <p>Southern Morocco is also known for its ksors (walled towns) and its casbahs (fortified dwellings that had been the homes of the gentry or local chieftains). Most that we passed as we drove northwest from Erfoud toward Ouarzazate (pronounced WAHR-zah-zaht) were modest one- or two-story affairs. Then there was Tifoultoute.</p>
        <p>This casbah, three miles north of Ouarzazate epitomizes Morocco's turbulent history. It was once owned by the Glaoui family, a colorful dynasty that ruled large stretches of southern Morocco and whose power sometimes rivaled the king's. In the 1950's, Pasha Thami al-Glaoui, the last of the line, conspired with the French to deport King Muhammad V, who had been agitating for independence. After independence, the Glauois tumbled from power and the casbah at Tifoultoute fell in disrepair.</p>
        <p>Poised on a small hill, with a commanding view of the Ouarzazate Valley, the casbah presented two faces. One was of pitted mud walls that were crumbling from years of neglect. The other was a restored portion of the fortress whose pink walls were rising from decay. We climbed to the battlements and gazed out on the broad valley below, marveling at the huge nests that storks had built atop the towers.</p>
        <p>Inside was the large central room where the pasha received visitors and supplicants. We lingered amid the plush pillows and whitewashed walls hung with Berber muskets in the rooms off the large chamber, where his four wives entertained guests. Close your eyes and you could imagine the power and intrigues of this court.</p>
        <p>If the intrigues of the Glaouis seem made for a Hollywood script, Ait Benhaddou just west of Ouarzazate, offers a perfect setting -- so much so that the dramatic mud-walled town has been used in location shots for a number of movies, including ''Gladiator.'' Considered one of the finest examples of a Moroccan ksor, this ancient village has been declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco.</p>
        <p>To reach it on its steep hill, visitors cross a river bed, dry when we were there. Once inside its walls, we wandered the narrow streets, and along with our guide, were invited inside a Berber home.</p>
        <p>The occupants -- one of the few families actually living there -- were shy about allowing us to take their pictures, but permitted us to explore their dwelling and offered us almonds. Their hospitality was typical of what we found in southern Morocco and it beckoned us to return.</p>
        <p>Driving south to casbahs and Saharan dunes</p>
        <p>In southern Morocco, with the exception of Ouarzazate, accommodations can be somewhat spare. It is best to make sure you have places reserved, rather than just taking a chance on what you might find.</p>
        <p>Travel agents in the United States specializing in Morocco can be very useful. You can get a list of agents by contacting the Moroccan National Tourist Office, 20 East 46th Street, Suite 1201, New York, N.Y. 10017;  (212) 557-2520, fax (212) 949-8148.</p>
        <p>We used one of those agents, Sarah Tours, 1803 Belleview Boulevard, Suite A1, Alexandria, Va. 22307; (800) 267-0036, fax (703) 765-7809; www.sarahtours.com. They provided ground transportation, including a driver and a guide, and can also handle accommodations. Sarah Tours also offered to provide Land Rovers into the desert and a hotel there, though we found both on our own.</p>
        <p>One thing to keep in mind. Telephone calls to Morocco from the United States (the country code is 212) are expensive, so it might be more economical to arrange your trip through stateside agents.</p>
        <p>Our desert hotel and car were provided by the Ettaiek brothers, who operate the Auberge Kasbah Tombouctou in Merzouga. They can be contracted through the Cafe des Dunes in Erfoud, (212-55) 57 67 93, fax (212-55) 77 765.</p>
        <p>The hotel is cheap -- $15 a person a night, at 11 dirhams to the dollar, including breakfast and dinner -- but also clean and with a friendly staff. The employees' English is pretty basic, so it helps to know a few French phrases.</p>
        <p>There are only a few hotels in Ait Benhaddou. We stayed at the Hotel Restaurant La Kasbah, (212-44) 89 03 02, which charges $23 a night for a double room. Like the Tombouctou, La Kasbah is not air-conditioned, and for good measure, the electricity is turned off at 10 p.m., though candles are provided. Perhaps its best feature is its chilly swimming pool, which provides a refreshing dip after a day in the heat.</p>
        <p>Admission to the Tifoultoute casbah, near Ouarzazate, is roughly $1. For information, contact the tourist office in Ouarzazate, (212-44) 88 24 85.</p>
