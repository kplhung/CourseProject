        <p>While negotiations over the final touches on the federal budget languished, a cranky Congress approved a temporary spending measure today that will keep many government agencies operating for at least another day.</p>
        <p>Meeting in an unusual Saturday session forced on them by President Clinton, the House passed the temporary spending measure, known as a continuing resolution, by a vote of 339 to 7. About an hour later the Senate approved the measure, 67 to 2. About 20 percent of the House and almost a third of the Senate missed the votes.</p>
        <p>The temporary spending measures are necessary because the federal government's authority to spend money expired with the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Congress has kept a number of federal agencies going by approving continuing resolutions that have lasted up to a week.</p>
        <p>Recently, however, because Mr. Clinton said he would sign stopgap measures that last only a day, Congress has had to meet daily, including Saturday and Sunday, to approve them. Mr. Clinton has also said he would veto permanent spending and tax bills that failed to meet some of the Democrats' major objectives.</p>
        <p>''The reality is we are being intimidated by the president, the Congress is,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania. ''We are, in fact, being humiliated.''</p>
        <p>Democrats counter that Republicans did not negotiate in good faith when they put together the spending bills and have been unable to finish the work on these measures.</p>
        <p>''I'm not trying to harass them, I'm trying to get them finished and get out of town,'' Mr. Clinton told reporters today.</p>
        <p>Though the two sides have agreed to add at least $4.1 billion to a $106.7 billion bill to finance the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Departments, James W. Dyer, staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, identified the following four major issues separating the sides:</p>
        <p>*The scope of amnesty that will be extended to illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>*Whether $1.3 billion in federal money will be given directly to local districts to be used only to renovate school buildings, or whether school districts will be allowed to use the money for other purposes.</p>
        <p>*The fate of the administration's request to give school districts $2.5 billion worth of tax credits for the interest they must pay on school construction bonds they issue.</p>
        <p>*Whether work rules intended to protect workers from repetitive motion injuries will be delayed.</p>
        <p>''Everything else is solvable in five minutes,'' Mr. Dyer said.</p>
