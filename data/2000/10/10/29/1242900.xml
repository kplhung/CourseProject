        <p>CANNON to right of them, cannon to left of them: that's how executives of Hyundai Motor America must feel as they ride into battle in the XG300, a new sedan at the top end of the midsize segment -- the bloodiest battlefield of the car wars.</p>
        <p>Part of an effort to expand Hyundai's lineup beyond inexpensive, entry-level cars -- and to put the world on alert that the South Korean company is capable of bigger things -- the new flagship confronts heavy artillery. The segment comprises some of the Japanese manufacturers' best-selling and highest-regarded cars, including the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima and Mitsubishi Eclipse, as well as domestic sedans like the Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Impala and Oldsmobile Intrigue.</p>

        <p>CANNON to right of them, cannon to left of them: that's how executives of Hyundai Motor America must feel as they ride into battle in the XG300, a new sedan at the top end of the midsize segment -- the bloodiest battlefield of the car wars.</p>
        <p>Part of an effort to expand Hyundai's lineup beyond inexpensive, entry-level cars -- and to put the world on alert that the South Korean company is capable of bigger things -- the new flagship confronts heavy artillery. The segment comprises some of the Japanese manufacturers' best-selling and highest-regarded cars, including the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima and Mitsubishi Eclipse, as well as domestic sedans like the Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Impala and Oldsmobile Intrigue.</p>
        <p>The XG300 seems to be aimed directly at the Maxima, and is virtually the same size. Both have front-wheel drive and 3-liter engines with modern dual-cam designs. But the XG300 is unlikely to keep pace in any soccer-mom drag races, since it weighs 400 pounds more and has 30 less horsepower.</p>
        <p>The price of $23,934 includes many luxury features like automatic climate control, leather seats, side air bags and automatic headlamps. For $1,500 more, an option group offers heated seats, a premium stereo and memory settings for the driver's seat and mirror preferences, pushing the fully equipped price to about $25,500. That may be uncomfortably close to ''near luxury'' cars like the Acura 3.2TL.</p>
        <p>Hyundai has had some success with its Sonata in the lower end of the midsize market, competing with cars like the Chevrolet Malibu and Nissan Altima. Sonata sales rose nearly 83 percent in the first three quarters of this year, to 38,720.</p>
        <p>Projections for the XG300 are far more modest, with only about 15,000 sales expected in the 2001 model year. Hyundai dealers, accustomed to selling to first-time buyers on tight budgets -- many of them with credit problems -- will have to cater to more affluent shoppers with high expectations for quality, reliability and service.</p>
        <p>In addition to the XG300 and the new Santa Fe sport utility, Hyundai has introduced an all-new third generation of its compact Elantra. For the first time, the line will include a hatchback. The Accent subcompact was redesigned for 2000; the Tiburon sporty coupe will get a makeover next year.</p>
