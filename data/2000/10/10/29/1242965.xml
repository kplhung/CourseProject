        <p>The Jets spent the week rehashing and recovering, reveling in Monday night's magnificent comeback victory while rubbing the emotional and physical exhaustion away. But like a fly buzzing about their heads, eluding their attempts to swat him away, comes Doug Flutie, the Buffalo quarterback who figures to pester the Jets in their game today, just enough to ensure that the Jets have fully forgotten the Miami Dolphins.</p>
        <p>Flutie will start in place of the injured Rob Johnson for the Bills (3-4), and the Jets (6-1) will have to guard against a letdown. The Jets played their best game of the season to that point when they beat the Bills, 27-14, on Sept. 27 with Johnson starting. But Flutie, as anyone who has watched a football game since he emerged from Boston College in 1984 knows, presents a different challenge entirely.</p>
        <p>Jets linebacker Mo Lewis rarely gives interviews and he probably wouldn't want to talk about Flutie anyway, because he was part of a moment that perhaps sums up Flutie's mind-set even more than the dodging and dashing that are the heralded part of his repertory.</p>
        <p>In the Jets' 17-3 loss to the Bills in the second game of last season, Flutie, at 5 feet 10 inches, 180 pounds, threw a tremendous block on Lewis, who is 6-3, 258, which aided a 12-yard run by Antowain Smith to the goal line. The Bills scored on the drive, which also included a 24-yard Flutie scramble.</p>
        <p>''He'll be challenging his sons to one-on-one basketball when he's 55,'' Coach Al Groh said. ''He has an insatiable desire to win and compete.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Flutie's competitiveness was on display last week when he chafed at what he perceives as slights against him and Vinny Testaverde, and at his own benching before Buffalo's wild-card playoff game last season.</p>
        <p>''We both went to the Pro Bowl in 1998, yet the following year Vinny has to go through a torn Achilles' and re-earn people's respect this year and I'm not good enough to start for this team in the playoffs,'' Flutie said. ''You're always trying to prove yourself, and Vinny and I have always been in that situation.''</p>
        <p>In the second game of last season, against the Jets, Flutie was 15 of 25 for 160 yards and 1 touchdown. He also ran seven times for 67 yards, more than any Jet rushed that day. When the Jets beat the Bills later in the season, he was 22 of 40 for 220 yards, but several of his miscues led to the Jets' victory. With the Bills pinned deep in their own territory, a blitzing Ray Mickens knocked the ball out of Flutie's hands in the end zone. Defensive end Eric Ogbogu recovered for a touchdown. A Flutie interception ended another drive deep in Jets territory.</p>
        <p>And, with just over four minutes remaining and the Bills on first and goal from the 10, Flutie's pass attempt was batted down at the line of scrimmage. It deflected off one lineman, bounced off the back of another and into the hands of Jason Wiltz. That play secured the Jets' victory.</p>
        <p>Flutie was injured when the Jets played the Bills earlier this season. But last week, in his first start in place of Johnson, he nearly led the Bills to an upset of the undefeated Vikings, and this time he did it almost completely with his arm. He completed 28 of 43 passes for 294 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he scrambled only once, for 8 yards.</p>
        <p>Even if Johnson has shown running ability at least equal to Flutie's -- he is the Bills' second-leading rusher, with 197 yards on 28 attempts -- Flutie's mobility still means a defense has to adjust to his way of playing.</p>
        <p>''Johnson is more of a dropback guy,'' cornerback Marcus Coleman said. ''You pretty much know where the ball is. Playing Flutie, you might be covering for 30 seconds on one play. He might go one side of the field to another. You have to stay with your man all the time. They're going to be scrambling, you're going to be scrambling. Until he pulls it down and runs or throws it away, there is no telling how long you're covering.''</p>
        <p>For a secondary, particularly the safeties, already wounded and surprised by the downfield theatrics of the Dolphins, the injection of Flutie into a team that is assumed to be desperate for a victory could be particularly ominous. Groh has spoken repeatedly this week of the need for the safeties to play better, to avoid the big plays that Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler was able to generate with apparent ease in the first half against the Jets.</p>
        <p>''It hurt,'' cornerback Aaron Glenn said. ''They came out firing that ball. It wasn't deke and dunk. It's not the fact that he can't do it; it's the fact that their game plan is to throw for 150 yards, and they had 100 yards in the first quarter. That was disheartening. We've got to make sure we don't let Buffalo come out with the same mind-set.''</p>
        <p>Flutie's mind-set is less clear. His relationship with Coach Wade Phillips and the Bills' organization is obviously chilly since his benching. But, if Flutie should display his old magic against the Jets, he could force Phillips to again consider Flutie as a starter, even when Johnson returns.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any control over that decision,'' Flutie said. ''I'm going to just try to play the best I can play, and if it makes it difficult on them to make a decision, great.</p>
        <p>''What amazes me is that every time I do step on the field and play well, it seems to surprise people. Being doubted all the time makes you shake your head.''</p>
