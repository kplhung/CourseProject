        <p>With crowns of leaves encircling their heads, Shmuel Mantinband and Imam Tibi tried to decide on which vacant couch to settle their toga-clad bodies. Lute music echoed forlornly through their cavernous Roman-themed banquet hall in an Old City devoid of tourists.</p>
        <p>''Wherever you want, you're the Caesar,'' Mr. Tibi said to Mr. Mantinband, who indeed is the Caesar. It's on his business card.</p>
        <p>For three years, Mr. Mantinband, an American-born Israeli, and Mr. Tibi, a Palestinian, have worked side by side in the Cardo Culinaria restaurant in the Jewish Quarter of the divided Old City. Mr. Mantinband, the boss, lived through Mr. Tibi's divorce, and Mr. Tibi, the manager, through the death of his employer's mother.</p>
        <p>Together, hundreds of times, they have delivered a historic spiel to  guests, peeled their grapes, washed their feet and dried between their toes. Working together in the ancient past was a bonding experience, they said. But in all that time, they avoided the present, or at least religion and politics. Then, their world exploded in a wave of violence that quickly unraveled most dreams of coexistence for Israelis and Palestinians. It also killed their business.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Mantinband, 46, and Mr. Tibi, 30, kept coming to their empty restaurant. With days to fill, they talked and talked, and discovered how completely differently they saw everything that was happening.</p>
        <p>''He saw black, I saw white,'' Mr. Mantinband said, adjusting the wreath encircling his knitted skullcap. ''I saw black, he saw white. It could make your jaw drop.''</p>
        <p>There are not many pairs like them, Israeli-Palestinian colleagues or friends who have established a solid enough base on which to walk together through the minefields of their disagreements. But they do exist, in a smattering of tourism businesses, industrial ventures, schools and human rights organizations. And their bonds, like their joint enterprises, are being challenged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mantinband, for instance, asked his friend point-blank why Palestinians were putting children in the midst of clashes to be killed.</p>
        <p>''The way it stands in the Arab street, it's jihad now,'' or holy war, Mr. Tibi said. ''In jihad situation, the rules are off. Kids don't ask their father and wives don't need the permission of their husband. Listen, we have direct orders from God. We are fighting for our freedom.''</p>
        <p>Swigging some lemonade with mint, Mr. Mantinband looked glum. That explanation did not make things any clearer, he said.</p>
        <p>In a previous discussion, Mr. Tibi had demanded to know why the Israelis could not control rock-throwing Palestinian crowds without shooting. ''What Israeli would go face the Arabs without a gun?'' Mr. Mantinband said was the first thought that crossed his mind. But he acknowledges that he then contemplated whether the cycle of violence could have been prevented if in the very beginning the Jerusalem police had used milder riot control techniques -- as they would at Jewish demonstrations.</p>
        <p>''Shmuel needs the explanation of my side, for sure,'' Mr. Tibi said, crossing his legs beneath a knee-length tunic. ''He knows how Israelis see things, but he doesn't know how Arabs see things. I have a better view into the Israelis. I speak Hebrew, I work in the Jewish Quarter.''</p>
        <p>The grandson of a rabbi active in the American civil rights movement, Mr. Mantinband sees himself as someone conditioned to ''see people as people.'' A soft-spoken man who is quite enthused by his restaurant's gimmicks, he admits that when he  bought the Cardo, he asked the seller if he should watch his back around the Palestinian workers. The seller, a Jew, laughed at him, he said, ''and rightly so.''</p>
        <p>Now, he says proudly, he leaves Mr. Tibi blank signed checks when he goes away.</p>
        <p>His public relations agent suggested recently that the Cardo staff, most of whom are Palestinian, deliver food to Israeli soldiers hunkered down in Gilo, a Jerusalem suburb, firing back at shooting from a Palestinian village.</p>
        <p>''I knew it would be great publicity, with all those cameras there,'' said Mr. Mantinband, who grew up in St. Louis. ''But I couldn't do that to Tibi and the others.'' Mr. Tibi looked down at the marble table before them, his face impassive.</p>
        <p>Open and gregarious, Mr. Tibi lives on the Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem. As a youth, he had studied at the Muslim school at Al Aksa Mosque in the heart of the Old City. ''It was like a yeshiva,'' he told his boss. ''They tell you everything here is yours.'' He barely set foot in West Jerusalem until his late teens.</p>
        <p>All those years, he said, ''I wanted so much for the opportunity to understand who is this enemy of mine.''</p>
        <p>He learned the restaurant business in the Old City. Over 10 years that taught him an easy collegiality around ''this enemy,'' the Israelis, he advanced swiftly into management in a way that gave him a stake in Jewish-Arab economic cooperation. With Mr. Mantinband, he oversaw the opening of a second Cardo Culinaria at a Hyatt near the Dead Sea. And he grew out of his marriage, and out of his neighborhood, although he still lives there. He developed several close friendships with Israeli Jews. And, to great scandal, he divorced his Palestinian wife, marrying a Danish woman who used to work as a waitress at the restaurant.</p>
        <p>''Think about that, I met my wife at a restaurant, too, when I was waiting tables at Grossinger's'' in the Catskills, Mr. Mantinband exclaimed. ''That's another thing we have in common.''</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Tibi has expanded his world, he still sees through the nationalist and religious lenses with which he was fitted as a young boy. Similarly, Mr. Mantinband, who is not a rigid ideologue and has swung back and forth politically, voting for Labor and Likud party leaders, still sees the situation just as the Israeli government puts it forth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mantinband believes that the violence began on Sept. 27, when two bombs exploded beside an army-escorted settlers' convoy in the Gaza Strip, killing an Israeli soldier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tibi believes that it began the following day, when Ariel Sharon, the Israeli rightist, made a politicized, heavily guarded visit to the area near Al Aksa Mosque.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mantinband can't ''see the big deal'' of Mr. Sharon's visit. Mr. Tibi, who let those words hang in the air an extra beat before responding, can't see how it can't be seen.</p>
        <p>''According to Islam, as I understand, anyone is welcome there,'' Mr. Mantinband said. ''I went and had no problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tibi answered, ''Shmuel, did you announce it in advance, your visit? Did you arrive with 1,500 soldiers? I have my doubts about whether he was really so interested in what there was to see.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mantinband: ''It was a political game. Sharon just wanted publicity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tibi: ''Well, he shouldn't have played a political game on one of our most holy spots on this earth. That step has been very costly. If it had been Rabin, O.K. I would have smiled. I cried on his grave. I put his picture on my wall. But Sharon had a history, really, with blood on his hands,'' he said, alluding to Mr. Sharon's leading role in the Israeli incursion into Lebanon in 1982.</p>
        <p>Both men say the deterioration in Israeli-Palestinian relations has disturbed them deeply. Mr. Tibi said that when he saw the pictures of the mob murders of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah, he wished he could have been there. ''I would have defended them with my body,'' he said. ''I have to hang my head just thinking about it.''</p>
        <p>Softened by that, Mr. Mantinband reminded him that they both think diplomacy is the only solution.</p>
        <p>But then he suggested that the explosive issue of Jerusalem's sovereignty be put aside for ''like 99 years.'' Mr. Tibi gently but firmly said that he did not think the Arab world's demand for sovereignty over Al Aksa could be postponed that long.</p>
        <p>''Until this mosque is free, there's no peace to talk about,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There was nothing to do but turn back to the oil lamps, urns, trumpets and helmets inside their restaurant. ''It's embarrassing to be pragmatic in a situation like this,'' Mr. Mantinband said. ''But we were really doing a very nice business here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tibi added: ''We will, again, I hope. But we will have to make it through many more months of this, I am afraid.''</p>
