        <p>THE CHTEAU DE ReSENLIEU</p>
        <p>By Lord Berners.</p>
        <p>Helen Marx/Turtle Point, paper, $13.95.</p>
        <p>''I had often heard foreigners, and particularly the French, criticized for not being sporting, for frivolity and laxity of morals, all of which deficiencies at that time appealed to me.'' Imagine the frustration, then, of the 16-year-old aspiring aesthete Gerald Tyrwhitt when he arrived in Normandy in the spring of 1900 to polish his French -- only to discover that no one understood a word he was saying. In this charming addendum to ''First Childhood'' and ''A Distant Prospect,'' his accounts of an out-of-kilter youth in the late-19th-century British aristocracy, Berners (the title he later inherited and by which he was also known as a composer and painter) describes his apprenticeship in Francophilia at the hands of Mme. O'Kerrins, the French widow of a French-naturalized Irishman, who presided over an elegantly derelict chateau, a rigid hierarchy of friends and family and a slightly less regimented assortment of English boarders. Berners fell in love with her, with her house, with the ''rampant'' picturesqueness of the surrounding landscape. Luckily, he was less enamored of much of his hostess's entourage, about whom he is satisfyingly scathing. Chief among these was Mme. O'Kerrins's nephew, Gerard, a supercilious banker who was convinced that most Englishmen remained virgins until they married and whose well-publicized affair with the insipid wife of a local doctor ''spoiled for me my subsequent reading of 'Madame Bovary.' ''Also in attendance were Mlle. Baghdad, who ''looked like a secretary who told fortunes as a sideline,'' and Mme. Bonnet, a sweet-faced widow who paid a bounty for dead cats to fertilize her magnificent begonias. But it was Mme. O'Kerrins, with ''her 18th-century personality,'' whom Berners took as his guide. ''It is more important for you to learn French,'' she briskly informed him, ''than to preserve your dignity.'' Berners managed to do both -- and retained his sense of humor as well.</p>
