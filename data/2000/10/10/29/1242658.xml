        <p>LAST year, one of the major television networks engaged me to develop an hourlong dramatic series. It hired me and flew me to Los Angeles, I was told, because my plays are ''real.''

        <p>I returned to the Chateau Marmont and sat by my cell phone. Finally, the call came. Of the eight network slots available for dramas, three would be cop shows, one would be a game show, and the remaining four would be taken by ''reality-based shows.'' No scripted dramas.

        <p>LAST year, one of the major television networks engaged me to develop an hourlong dramatic series. It hired me and flew me to Los Angeles, I was told, because my plays are ''real.'' I got to work and obliged my bosses with a script so real, so topical, so without concession to tired television tropes, that it looked as if my first time out I might garner that elusive prize: a produced pilot.</p>
        <p>I returned to the Chateau Marmont and sat by my cell phone. Finally, the call came. Of the eight network slots available for dramas, three would be cop shows, one would be a game show, and the remaining four would be taken by ''reality-based shows.'' No scripted dramas. This was a strategy, it turned out, to compete with the juggernaut that was ''Who Wants to Be and/or Marry a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>The network felt it needed to stanch the hemorrhage of viewers lost to these game shows (not to mention cable), and it smelled something in the air. People wanted to see real people behaving, the network speculated, citing the success in Sweden of ''Expedition Robinson,'' which would become our ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>I was assured that my pilot was real, but that it could never be real enough. The television audience, I was told, had become too sophisticated for scripted drama -- those weren't actors sweating in front of Regis! Darva really did marry that millionaire! -- and viewers were clamoring for something more real.</p>
        <p>But the shows that resulted -- ''Big Brother,''  ''American High''  and the Everest of the genre, ''Survivor'' -- ended up having very little to do with reality. Unlike the landmark 1970's documentary ''An American Family,'' about the Louds, the hourlong reality-based programs last season ranged from the well-intentioned (''American High,'' which followed students for a year) to the hokey (''Survivor''). Why? Because their ''reality'' had been meticulously arranged for television consumption.</p>
        <p>This kind of striving toward reality without the possibility of achieving it is the subject of ''Paris Is Burning,'' Jennie Livingston's 1991 documentary about Harlem drag balls. At these events, where the dance fad of voguing began, drag did not merely mean men passing as women: contestants competed in categories like military and schoolboy. Whoever had the most ''realness,'' that is, whoever could pass in the real world -- the world outside the cloistered drag balls -- was awarded the grand prize. There was no mistaking what was, ahem, underneath it all. The goal was to look as real as possible when everyone knew there was no chance of ever really being so.</p>
        <p>As my dreams of syndication evaporated, I got my plane ticket back. Flying over Las Vegas, I pondered ''realness.'' And I don't mean ''realism,'' a word burdened with too many connotations and often used interchangeably with ''naturalism'' when talking about theater or film. Eugene O'Neill said, ''I wish to God some genius were gigantic enough to define the separateness of these terms once and for all!'' No, I mean realness as a perspective that suddenly seemed pervasive: equal parts voyeurism, anthropology, longing and empathy. A moving in as opposed to a stepping back.</p>
        <p>And no matter how mercenary or exploitative or sensationalistic -- or even noble -- the networks' intentions were, there was something in the air: the culture seemed saturated in realness.</p>
        <p>Technological advancements make it possible for any nascent Scorsese with Dad's credit card to buy and make his or her own digital video movie. Memoir hysteria shapes the publishing world as we read about everyone's emotionally barren childhood. A resurgence of the representational in the visual arts indicates that the tangible is suddenly interesting again as subject matter. ''Survivor II'' is heading our way, and ''Hopkins 24/7'' is already here to give us the realness that ''E.R.'' could only hope to convey.</p>
        <p>Why all this realness all of a sudden? Is it just our inner Peeping Tom? Or could it be a strike against Disneyfication and the McCorporate presence that put story second to product placement and merchandising tie-ins? Or is it simply the natural progression of postmodernism, with real life as the found object made into a kind of reality collage?</p>
        <p>The last century saw the decimation of the rural and communal and the domination of the urban and the separate. We concede that Main Street is gone and our village has been a global one for some time. And though we are still wired together psychologically in the human tribe, it is the clarity of our AOL connection that keeps us in contact.</p>
        <p>Is it any wonder that we crave human connection? Then what about live theater, the medium that invented ''realness,'' which is one of the things it still does best? I mean, isn't theater a part of the culture?</p>
        <p>And so I returned home, to the theater, with hope. Certainly someone who wrote as ''real'' as I did would find succor among my people. I would be embraced by the burgeoning realness I was sure to encounter downstage center.</p>
        <p>But a quick glance showed otherwise. Off Broadway, the Wooster Group and Anne Bogart continued their fascinating deconstructions of classic realistic plays. But this was hardly ''realness.'' And while revivals of those actual plays were also being produced, mostly they were so ''names'' could flex their muscles between films. New realistic plays were, of course, also being faithfully produced, but uniformly they mimicked the realistic conventions of theater 50 or 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more damning, many young theater artists I spoke with generally dismissed the notion of any drama that seemed realistic with derisive phrases like ''kitchen sink'' or ''front porch.'' O.K., so maybe this was merely a generational response. But the consensus seemed to be: where is the white-hot, up-to-the-minute, closer-than-close, contemporary realness as represented everywhere else in the culture?</p>
        <p>At the Union Square Theater, it turned out, where until recently Moises Kaufman's ''Laramie Project'' was playing. In the great and recent tradition of Anna Deavere Smith's ''Fires in the Mirror'' and ''Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' here was theater that seemed to walk in step with the culture at large.</p>
        <p>Transcribed from tapes of witnesses to actual events, the work of both Mr. Kaufman and Ms. Smith brings a topical immediacy to the stage, refuting the outmoded style of American social realism -- all right, kitchen-sink dramas -- that theater artists, and critics, decry. If one accepts the theory that realism was appropriated from the theater by television with Norman Lear's revolutionary sitcoms ''All in the Family'' and ''Maude'' (and was revived, arguably, with Roseanne's working-class lament in the 80's), then artists like Mr. Kaufman and Ms. Smith have reclaimed what was once known as realism for the theater in new and provocative ways.</p>
        <p>The well-known voice teacher Kristin Linklater, in her book ''Freeing Shakespeare's Voice: The Actor's Guide to Talking the Text,'' writes of the special power of the spoken word as it is heard live; its ability to unite an audience not only in meaning, but also in sound. In other words, a line of dialogue effects a physiological response that reverberates in the senses as well as the mind. This is what the kids call inter activity. This is realness plus. And this is what audiences everywhere are searching for.</p>
        <p>Voting half-naked potential millionaires off an island? I think not. Try Off Broadway.</p>
        <p>But instead, people continue to fill the movie theaters, read the memoirs, watch the cable and even perfect the technology to -- paradoxically -- have a more intimate experience. And so, unaware of what they are missing, they need to be redirected toward the budding new theater of realness. To plays that portray people living in a society unique to its time, and how that society affects them, as well as how they affect each other in it. To works like ''Charlie Victor Romeo,'' seen earlier this year at the Collective Unconscious, the script for which derived from transcripts of cockpit voice recorders; or to Richard Maxwell's stripped-to-the-bone realness in ''Boxing 2000'' and his other plays.</p>
        <p>Theater artists and producers should be inspired by such work, which embraces theater's singular power: to contemplate our collective reality; as audience, actor and story engage in an unspoken discussion of what reality is, how definitions of reality can be broadened. Theater affords this opportunity like no other medium, as actors and audiences breathe side by side, together engendering the spiritual and meditative power that that shared experience implies.</p>
        <p>Those who are in the theater must work fast before there is a camera in every home and we are paying to watch ourselves. Let the theater pursue the drama, a drama that is immediate and interactive.</p>
        <p>Film cannot do this. Television cannot do this. The Internet and digital video cannot do this. Theater can.</p>
