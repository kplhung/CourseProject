        <p>AN emerging theater company is putting its credibility on the line by taking a chance on an unproven, unsettling play.</p>
        <p>After two years of holding 15 free-of-charge, one-night-only readings at the Croton Free Library, Hudson Stage is making the leap to a full production in Westchester, which has not been traditionally welcoming to sustained serious theater by professional standards.</p>
        <p>And with ''Full Bloom'' by Suzanne Bradbeer, the Julie Harris Theater in the Clear View School here is now, fittingly, home to a professional theater company.</p>
        <p>It's a test case all around -- for a company, for a play, for a theater, for a county. Only the hard-hearted would fail to acknowledge such sweeping gallantry of purpose.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about the future,'' said Dan Foster, the play's director and one of the company's three founders and producers, with Denise Bessette and Olivia Sklar. ''But first we have to pass the test.''</p>
        <p>The company is to have another staged reading of a new play at the Croton Library on Nov. 17, and three more in the spring, but its mission of mounting full productions of what Mr. Foster calls ''different fare for savvy audiences'' depends on the turnout for ''Full Bloom.''</p>
        <p>''We don't compete,'' Mr. Foster added, referring to theater in Manhattan. ''We're concerned about the word -- the naked word. And people are telling us how beautiful it is to hear silence, no amplification, to sense the connection between an audience and the actors, without an electronic middle man.''</p>
        <p>In ''Full Bloom,'' Ms. Bradbeer may be trying to put a contemporary spin on a time-worn story. Phoebe does not want to be noticed for being a pretty girl. Phoebe wants to be noticed for just being.</p>
        <p>Presumably, the playwright is crying out against the hollow values of a youth-crazed culture and charting its damaging effects on a fragile 16-year-old -- and on all the ostensibly well-meaning grown-ups who notice her in all the wrong ways.</p>
        <p>What is clear is Ms. Bradbeer's destination and that somehow she gets there. But the road taken is circuitous; the playwright's direction, muddled. Curiously, the play has a payoff. Since Ms. Bradbeer fails to make efficient use of stage time, one has the odd impression that it's really a movie-of-the-week she's after.</p>
        <p>In its current phase of development, ''Full Bloom'' has piercing moments. No ordinary girl, Phoebe sits moonstruck on the fire escape, obsessing over an abstract painting by Barnett Newman. Here is a Juliet of the spirit, except that she's grounded enough to quibble with Juliet's reference to the moon's inconstancy. To Phoebe, the moon is an omnipresence, and with Jesse, who notices her all right and for the right reasons, she can act out a modern psychodramatic balcony scene.</p>
        <p>Jesse has had a crush on Phoebe ever since ''Twelfth Night'' was assigned to their English class and she audaciously suggested ''Titus Andronicus'' instead. Clearly, Phoebe, named after the goddess of the moon as well as Holden Caulfield's sister, lives a rich life of the mind and a most distressed, incomplete real one. She cannot handle Jesse's affection and she cannot handle herself.</p>
        <p>No mundane parents can deal with, much less try to understand, the gifted quirky Phoebe. Surely her feeling at one with Salinger's siblings, more so with Holden actually, signals trouble, a disturbance not just skin deep. But her parents, Richard and Jane (played by Ms. Bessette with a shrewd grasp of the character's helpless egocentricism), now divorcing after 20 years, have been clueless all along. That Phoebe moons about ''the time when my parents were in love'' is, of course, telling, but her mounting crisis is attributable to everything in and out of sight.</p>
        <p>Richard has taken off with Emma, who is much younger than Phoebe's mother, while Jane is so hysterical abut her own vanishing youth, she primps in front of the looking glass that Phoebe talks of wanting to go through, Alice-like. How can such preoccupied parents even grasp Phoebe's literary allusions, as constant as her moon, much less admit that their daughter is troubled?</p>
        <p>Whatever Jane sees, as opposed to perceives -- ''I think she's unhappy,'' she observes about her daughter -- might be classified as a case example of that buzzword, denial. But mental health professionals would likely have other designations for Phoebe's disorder while early childhood educators and counselors could go on about Jane and Richard as parents who are perception-  and caring-challenged. Richard (and Emma) do not appear but are much talked about; in a movie-of-the-week they would doubtless have important roles.</p>
        <p>In the play, as it is, Crystal, a television actress, and Jim, her husband, are highly visible, most effectively so, given the commandingly natural performances of Catherine Campbell and Christopher Innvar. With Jim's loving disapproval, Crystal, in her early 40's but needing to look like late-20's, is about to get, and then gets, an eye tuck operation.</p>
        <p>That Phoebe is the reluctant by-product of a society where advertisements for kinder gentler face lifts and constructive surgery are commonplace doesn't help a girl who says ''being beautiful shouldn't be important,'' and ''don't look at me.''</p>
        <p>Yet Phoebe also talks of how she used to dream of being pretty, that she was once called unbelievably ugly. And of a traumatic trip to Florence, where, thinking of Michaelangelo, she was encircled and traumatized by four or five Italian men who admired but did not harm her. If only a sense of self esteem and an understanding of cultural differences could have been her saving graces that day.</p>
        <p>The playwright's mixed messages may reflect Phoebe's problem, but not by design; Even in a final harrowing scene, which arrives without an essential sense of momentum, inevitability and theatrical tension, an aesthetic cop-out is substituted for a clinical, not just borderline, dysfunction.</p>
        <p>''Full Bloom'' demands a dramaturge as much as its otherwise engaging heroine needs help. In the meantime, audiences are hearing human sounds. And they're in on the development of a play of promise, and a company that must be encouraged to keep on.</p>
        <p>Talking about testing the waters, Ms. Sklar, who is also an actress, said, ''We want to do original provocative work, with an edge, and this was a bold choice. We know there's an appetite for it out here, and we're doing it all, the books, the publicity, reading the scripts. That's the glamorous life of producers. And I do the company laundry.''</p>
        <p>''Full Bloom'' at the Julie Harris Theater in the Clear View School, 550 Albany Post Road (Route 9), Briarcliff Manor. Box office: (914) 271- 2811. Three workshops are to be held with students of the Clear View School, during the run, which ends Nov. 5.</p>
