        <p>AFTER little more than a year, White Oak Bistro in New Canaan is gone. In its place, in the former Veterans Hall with stately front columns, is 62 Main. It retains much of the decor, but differs in name, menu and front-of-house staff. Chef Robert Troilo was formerly at Habana in South Norwalk.</p>
        <p>We like the fact that the small, mostly American menu is interlaced with Asian ingredients. The restaurant's subtitle is ''eclectic American cuisine,'' and indeed it is, in a positive sense.</p>

        <p>AFTER little more than a year, White Oak Bistro in New Canaan is gone. In its place, in the former Veterans Hall with stately front columns, is 62 Main. It retains much of the decor, but differs in name, menu and front-of-house staff. Chef Robert Troilo was formerly at Habana in South Norwalk.</p>
        <p>We like the fact that the small, mostly American menu is interlaced with Asian ingredients. The restaurant's subtitle is ''eclectic American cuisine,'' and indeed it is, in a positive sense.</p>
        <p>To wit: a first course of sparkling fresh tuna tartar was served with a frothy wasabi mousse, tabiko (flying fish roe) caviar and something inventively labeled Fuji toast. This turned out to be toasted bread triangles to which a layer of nori (the Japanese seaweed used in wrapping sushi) was attached with egg white and then baked to adhere firmly.</p>
        <p>A creatively diverse entree was a fan of seared breast of Muscovy duck slices, prettily topped with strands of grilled scallions, resting on a palate-tickling hoisin-soy reduction. With the duck came shiitake mushrooms and ginger-scented basmati rice.</p>
        <p>A revved-up dish of Caribbean-spiced pork consisted of tender pork slices engulfed by a sweet pineapple demi-glaze, along with a mango-horseradish salsa full of red and green peppers, cilantro and incendiary jalapenos. Also on the plate: a goat cheese- caramelized onion tart and a polenta wedge.</p>
        <p>Even our favorite entree, roasted chicken au jus, had its offbeat touches. The skin over the plump bird (a full breast and leg) was basted with red wine, lemon juice and honey to a glorious mahogany color. The meaty, juicy bird, redolent of rosemary and thyme, came with creamy mashed potatoes, a mushroom fricassee (of black trumpets and oyster mushrooms) and al dente haricots verts stippled with diced fresh tomatoes, turning an essentially simple dish into perfection.</p>
        <p>Most starters were also intriguing. We were partial to the crispy vegetable spring roll. Not only was it beautifully presented, in tower-like cross-sections, but both the wrapper and crunchy carrot-zucchini-scallion-watercress stuffing tasted crispy-fresh. What added extra spark was the elusive flavoring of a sweet-tangy prune puree (infused subtly with sesame oil and soy) on which each segment of spring roll rested.</p>
        <p>Vying for best of show was the mushroom pouch, a fricassee of black trumpets and chanterelles of immense flavor and freshness in a luxuriant brandy cream, between two layers of puffy and crisp puff pastry.</p>
        <p>Disappointments were minor. A soup of the day, a wishy-washy cream of fennel, cried out for more seasoning, though the black trumpet mushroom added a decorative flourish. A starter of seafood ravioli, pricey at $14, had tiny bits of shrimp and other seafood, but was overshadowed by large, loose layers (not pouches) of saffron-spinach pasta floating in a tomato-infused broth, more just pasta than the stuffed seafood pasta dish we expected.</p>
        <p>Among the house-made desserts, a molten chocolate cake released a heaven-sent explosion of chocolate that melted in the mouth, while the profiteroles filled with ice creams (cafe au lait and vanilla) under an avalanche of velvety chocolate sauce were certainly the lightest, freshest,  most cloudlike pastry puffs we have enjoyed in years. Heirloom apple tart with cinnamon ice cream was also appealing, but would be even more so if served warm. We had no complaints at all about the light and fluffy pumpkin cheesecake with swirls of raspberry and mango coulis.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two, three courses apiece was $89, before tax, tip or beverages. A moderate-size selection of French and American wines is priced from $22 up. Eclectic 62 Main may be, but in the sense of being lively and creative in blending diverse flavors and cultures. And praise be, it is also open for lunch.</p>
