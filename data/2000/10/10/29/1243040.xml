        <p>In the solidly Republican precincts of Nassau County, G.O.P. candidates have literally shed their political colors, a visible sign of their rush to abandon the county's once vaunted Republican machine.</p>
        <p>The candidates have dropped the electric  blue and orange that had come to symbolize both Nassau County and its reigning party. The new colors are soothing pastels and earth tones, a switch that is by no means inconsequential.</p>
        <p>Nassau Republicans, particularly the county's five state senators, have been forced to reinvent themselves in a tough election year. They have expunged nearly all mention of their county party affiliation from advertisements, mailings and other campaign material, keenly aware that the county's near fiscal collapse helped propel  Democrats to power in the County Legislature for the first time in decades last November. Even the Republicans' longtime logo, a bald eagle, has vanished from some billboards.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high, not only for local Republicans but also for the statewide party. Republicans are locked in a fierce struggle to maintain control of the State Senate, and they see the prospect of losing even a few races in Nassau as a grave threat.</p>
        <p>The party's leaders in Albany need to win Nassau so much that they have instructed their candidates to steer clear of partisan appeals and run campaigns stressing cheerful nonpartisan themes: making college affordable, improving schools, cleaning up the environment, fighting consumer fraud and providing health coverage for the poor.</p>
        <p>Michael A. L. Balboni, a Republican senator from Mineola, summed up the strategy by saying: ''Nassau County is changing, and people here are less interested in party affiliation than they used to be. They are more interested in what you've accomplished. That's why I am trying to build a base of support that is truly nonpolitical.''</p>
        <p>Republicans still outnumber Democrats three to two, and service in Nassau has begun the careers of some of the state's most influential politicians, including Ralph M. Marino, the former majority leader of the State Senate, and Alfonse M. D'Amato, the three-term United States senator who anointed George E. Pataki as the Republican candidate for governor in 1994.</p>
        <p>But this year, Nassau County is one of the most interesting -- and highly unpredictable -- places in the state politically. Its Republican base still poses a battle for Democrats, who are trying to unseat all five of the county's Republican senators.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Republicans are expressing concern that the voter uprising of last November will continue on Election Day and sweep some Republican incumbents from power, along with one of the nation's last great political machines. The county is still facing the prospect of a state takeover as local leaders grapple with huge deficits projected over the next few years.</p>
        <p>''Nassau Republicans are desperately trying to distance themselves from the county organization that gave birth to most of their careers,'' said Senator Eric T. Schneiderman of Manhattan, who heads the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. ''But the Democrats of Nassau County are not going to let them fool voters that way.''</p>
        <p>The county's fiscal problems are creating headaches for Republicans outside the county as well. Democrats have unleashed a series of campaign advertisements attacking Republican senators in New York City and upstate for voting to approve a $100 million state bailout for Nassau County. Their strategy is simple enough: stir up resentment against Republicans for bailing out one of the richest counties in the nation.</p>
        <p>Democrats, too, are running campaigns that make little mention of their own agenda. Instead they try to portray the five Republican senators as pawns of Nassau County's Republican leadership, particularly the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, who has been widely blamed for the mismanagement.</p>
        <p>For example, one Democratic television commercial shows a man crouching under a desk as the narrator accuses Republican senators of doing Mr. Gulotta's bidding in the State Capitol. ''Our state senators can't hide from their records as members of the Nassau Republican machine,'' the narrator says. ''We need state senators who will put our needs first, not their party's.''</p>
        <p>Democrats have been particularly emboldened by the returns of last year's county races showing how poorly the Republican line did in the districts held by Nassau's five Republican state senators: Carl L. Marcellino, Kemp Hannon, Mr. Balboni, Dean G. Skelos and Charles J. Fuschillo. Over all, the Republican line received 36 percent of the vote in Mr. Marcellino's district, 41 percent in Mr. Hannon's district, 36 percent in Mr. Balboni's district, 40 percent in Mr. Skelos's district and 39 percent in Mr. Fuschillo's district.</p>
        <p>Democrats say these figures spell potential trouble for the Republican Party when taken together with recent internal polls showing lingering voter resentment over the county's fiscal mismanagement under Republican rule. ''Nassau County is a total wild card,'' said Martin Connor, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate.</p>
        <p>But Republicans say that Democrats are drawing the wrong conclusion from last year's results, noting that Republican senators are far more popular and better known in their districts than are county legislators, and have records that distinguish them from local officeholders.  That said, the five Republican senators have sought to distance themselves from their local colleagues,  asserting that the county's problems are not the fault of the state. They have chosen to run campaigns that feature warm, almost apolitical themes that make a direct appeal to women and elderly voters.</p>
        <p>In the Fifth Senate District near Oyster Bay, Mr. Marcellino's campaign is blanketing neighborhoods with glossy brochures and pamphlets that underscore the overall strategy. One pamphlet features a photograph of two boys playing in a pile of bright orange and red leaves and then lists the senator's work on behalf of improving schools and cleaning up the environment. ''No one is fighting harder for our children than Senator Carl Marcellino,'' the pamphlet reads.</p>
        <p>The pitch is almost identical -- in tone, at least -- in the Ninth Senate District here in the Rockville Centre area, where Mr. Skelos's political operation is circulating fliers reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's 1984 ''Morning In America'' advertisements. They feature a photo of the sun rising over water with a hopeful message: ''Cutting taxes, creating jobs, a growing economy. A brighter future made possible because of Senator Dean Skelos's leadership.''</p>
        <p>On the campaign trail, the senators maintain the same buoyant tone and message. The other day, for example, Mr. Skelos visited a center for the elderly here in his district, where he delivered a stump speech laying out Albany's accomplishments this year: prescription drug coverage for the elderly, additional restrictions on gun owners, new penalties for hate crimes and financial assistance for college students.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Skelos noted, with some relish, that Washington could not make good on such an ambitious agenda. ''This has been a remarkable year in Albany,'' he said, drawing applause. ''I like to kid my federal friends that we accomplished in Albany what Washington is still talking about.''</p>
        <p>But for all the cheery talk, Democrats are working hard to remind Nassau voters that their state senators are creations of the Republican machine that brought the county close to financial ruin. Larry Silverman, a lawyer who is Mr. Marcellino's Democratic challenger, poked fun at the fact that Nassau Republicans are so desperate to soften their image and distance themselves from their own party that they are beginning to sound like Democrats.</p>
        <p>''If one did not know Mr. Marcellino was a Republican, one would think he was a Democrat, based on the issues,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''He is running on a Democratic record, not his own.'' But Mr. Silverman vowed not to let voters forget his challenger's political roots.</p>
        <p>''Marcellino is the handpicked successor to Ralph Marino,'' he said,  referring to the former majority leader, who came from Oyster Bay.  ''He is the product of the Nassau Republican machine. He has marched lock step with the party from the start.''</p>
