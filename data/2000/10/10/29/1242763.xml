        <p>TO many residents of Hyde Park, the future of the town -- and even of the Hudson Valley -- comes down to two disputed parcels of land across from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Home on Route 9.</p>
        <p>A year ago, members of the environmental group Scenic Hudson discovered that the two properties, which total 45 acres and include a vacant lot and a drive-in theater, were being marketed to big-box retail chains, including Wal-Mart, for possible development. One of the sites had already been the focus of an extended battle over a Wal-Mart proposal in the early 1990's.</p>

        <p>TO many residents of Hyde Park, the future of the town -- and even of the Hudson Valley -- comes down to two disputed parcels of land across from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Home on Route 9.</p>
        <p>A year ago, members of the environmental group Scenic Hudson discovered that the two properties, which total 45 acres and include a vacant lot and a drive-in theater, were being marketed to big-box retail chains, including Wal-Mart, for possible development. One of the sites had already been the focus of an extended battle over a Wal-Mart proposal in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''Our board felt that this represented an emergency, a significant threat to a national historic place,'' said Ned Sullivan, the executive director of Scenic Hudson.</p>
        <p>The group entered into talks with the owner of the property, and by June had secured an option to buy the two properties for $3.1 million, with the intention of developing them in a way that was more consistent with the area.</p>
        <p>Scenic Hudson had not raised all the money it needed. It was counting on Representative John Sweeney, a Democrat whose district includes Hyde Park and who was working on a federal appropriation of $2.6 million to help the National Park Service buy land in the area, including -- they hoped -- one of the two sites.</p>
        <p>But in September the Hyde Park Town Board, led by Supervisor Yancy McArthur, voted to reject the federal funds, angering many residents and provoking a spirited debate among town officials and residents about how the area should be developed.</p>
        <p>Scenic Hudson still plans to buy the properties, but the group is still roughly $300,000 short of the money it needs, and is facing a deadline of Tuesday to raise it all.</p>
        <p>Mr. McArthur has said repeatedly that he voted against the federal aid because he does not want to see any more land in Hyde Park taken off the tax rolls. The land currently owned by the National Park Service, including the F.D.R. Home and Presidential Library and Eleanor Roosevelt's home, Val-Kill, does not generate taxes for the town, though it does contribute to the school district. If the Park Service acquired the two additional properties the town would lose $59,000 a year, ''not to mention revenues that could be had from county sales taxes from tourist-related businesses -- that money goes back to the towns.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the town's economy has stagnated for years, and residents do not have enough shopping options, Mr. McArthur said. ''I really don't think Hyde Park has had enough development,'' he added.</p>
        <p>A number of town residents agreed that the town, which is largely a bedroom community and suffered heavily when I.B.M. downsized its nearby facilities in the early 1990's, needed more economic development, particularly in the area of tourist amenities like bed and breakfasts and restaurants.</p>
        <p>But many residents, environmentalists and officials also said Mr. McArthur failed to recognize the importance of the two properties to the town's tourism industry, and said that the wrong kind of development could pose a real threat. The Roosevelt sites drew more than 500,000 visitors last year.</p>
        <p>''It was a big mistake,'' Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat, said of the town board's decision to reject the federal funds. ''It was a self-inflicted wound to the community and the economy of the community, and the important historical heritage of the town.''</p>
        <p>Wendy Nicholas, the northeast director for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said, ''We have been alarmed by the prospect of a major big box retail development occurring right across the road from F.D.R.'s home and library.'' That prospect was one reason the National Trust listed the Hudson River Valley as one of America's 11 most endangered historic places earlier this year, Ms. Nicholas added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan said Scenic Hudson never intended to leave the two properties undeveloped, and hopes to create a tourist site that will offer some economic benefit to the town.</p>
        <p>Sarah Olson, the superintendent at the National Park Service for the Hyde Park sites, said, ''Scenic Hudson and the National Park Service have been meeting regularly with community leaders to accomplish our goals for preserving the park and providing some clear economic benefits for the town that would at least be equal to the loss of taxes if those properties were to become federally owned.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan said the group had discussed several possible uses for the larger of the two properties, which is just under 30 acres, in a series of meetings with town residents. Those options include upgrading the existing drive-in theater, or turning it into a historic period drive-in; building a World War II-Depression era museum, to complement the F.D.R. heritage; and a combined commercial area and point of departure for the F.D.R. property and other sites in the area.</p>
        <p>Mr. McArthur said he did not trust Scenic Hudson, and suspected that they would leave the properties vacant and apply for tax-exempt status if they acquired them.</p>
        <p>He said Scenic Hudson had opposed a new gallery and gift shop complex that was approved by the town planning board last week. ''How can they actually support tourist-related business on something they own, when they don't support it in the private sector?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>David Opstad, the developer of the new complex, who also owns a McDonald's in Hyde Park, said, ''As a businessman, they  don't give you a good feeling that they are in favor of development in general.''</p>
        <p>But a former town supervisor, Tom Spence, said Mr. McArthur and others had an exaggerated view of what new development could do for the town. He said he had done a study showing that adding 10 commercial developments assessed at $2.5 million each would only lower taxes by 10 cents per $1,000 of taxes paid by town residents.</p>
        <p>And Dot Chenevert, the owner of the Green Oak Florist and a former president of the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, said Mr. McArthur and his allies did not understand that tourism is the natural base of the town's economy, and that the wrong kind of development could harm it.</p>
        <p>''They seem to think that somebody is going to build a multimillion-dollar complex in the middle of nowhere,'' she said. ''I don't know what world they're living in.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chenevert added that no development proposals would get very far unless the town addressed its inadequate sewers -- a problem she and others had been trying to address for years. Mr. McArthur had not been helpful with that problem, she said, and his refusal of federal funds would make it even harder to secure aid to fix the problem in the future.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Chenevert and several other Hyde Park residents said the controversy had highlighted the need to define a broader vision for how the area should be developed. Although the town board completed a revised master plan in 1996, the zoning to support it has not been written.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has come forward to say what the town should look like, and we need to do that,'' she added.</p>
