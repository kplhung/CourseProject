        <p>While Representative Bob Franks got back on his campaign bus today to canvass New Jersey for votes, his Democratic rival, Jon S. Corzine, spent the day delivering a get-out-the-vote message to people who were already in his corner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's intensive effort to turn out Democratic voters in the June primary helped him win the nomination in what had looked like an uphill fight. Now, with a consistent lead in the polls and more money to spend than Mr. Franks, the Republican, Mr. Corzine's team is trying to guard against apathy.</p>
        <p>''Look folks, it's 10 days to the election,'' Mr. Corzine told about 300 elderly men and women at a breakfast in the Masonic Temple on Irvine Turner Boulevard here. ''It's show time! Show time! We have to get out and vote. We have to get out and vote.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Corzine has a consistent lead in the polls and far more money to spend in the last days of the race, Democrats who traveled with him today, from city to suburb, expressed the nagging concern that overconfidence would be fatal to the campaign.</p>
        <p>''This is more of an activation,'' said Gilbert W. Lugossy, the former Democratic sheriff of Mercer County, explaining why Mr. Corzine took two hours to knock on the doors of homeowners in Hamilton Township who already had Corzine signs on their lawns.</p>
        <p>''This is for the people who don't feel they need to vote, based on the polls and the money and everything,'' Mr. Lugossy said. ''This is to make them so they'll go out to talk to people and get out to vote.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's television ads have appeared so frequently that he is sometimes greeted like a celebrity.</p>
        <p>''Boy, you're a real TV star,'' Chet Lucuski, the president of a local group of older citizens, said when he answered Mr. Corzine's knock in Hamilton Township early this afternoon.</p>
        <p>''Well, an ugly one then,'' Mr. Corzine shot back.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Corzine guarded against apathy, Mr. Franks spent the day trying to ride a new sense of energy as the underdog. At each stop on his bus tour, he reminded voters that Mr. Corzine's lead had narrowed to 5 percentage points in one poll, and that with a fresh $600,000 from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he would be able to get his message out more effectively than before.</p>
        <p>''We are gaining momentum everywhere we go,'' Mr. Franks said at the Forum Diner in Paramus at 8 a.m. It was the second of six restaurants he visited today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks also received the endorsement of the 5,000-member Italian American Police Society in Hillsdale, and later attended a rally with the Burlington Women's Republican Club in Delran.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks is a great believer in visits to diners, in part because they and early-morning commuter rail platforms are among the few places where people have a few minutes to listen.</p>
        <p>''We feel that this is the best way to reach voters,'' said Peter DeMarco, Mr. Franks's spokesman. ''There is absolutely no substitute for this.'' But it is the one-voter-at-a-time approach that makes it seem as if Mr. Franks is still trying to win new supporters while Mr. Corzine has decided to focus on consolidating the support he has.</p>
        <p>From the breakfast in Newark to a door-to-door walk through the Broad Street Park section of Hamilton to a small rally at the Ancient Order of Hibernians' Hamilton headquarters, Mr. Corzine's supporters made it clear that the Democratic campaign had entered a new phase.</p>
        <p>''I'm a little bit concerned about Democrats having a laissez-faire attitude toward this election,'' said Brian M. Hughes, a Democratic Mercer County freeholder. ''People may believe because of Franks not being on the air and the polls showing us ahead that they can sit this one out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine was accompanied at the Hibernians' hall by Senator Frank Lautenberg, who is retiring from the seat Mr. Corzine hopes to win, and by George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader and United States envoy to the Northern Ireland peace talks.</p>
        <p>Before a slim crowd of about 50, Mr. Mitchell outlined his party's claims to social progress.</p>
        <p>''Over bitter Republican opposition, we passed Social Security and Medicare,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''And if you want to preserve them, you'll vote Democratic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, however, is also running on his strong support for the old social welfare programs, including ensuring the soundness of the Social Security trust fund and extending greater prescription drug benefits to the elderly.</p>
        <p>It is axiomatic in politics that voters who have just shaken the hand of a candidate say nice things about the candidate to journalists, and the people who were greeted by Mr. Franks and Mr. Corzine today tended to follow that rule.</p>
        <p>''I like what he says about Social Security,'' Ethel Lucuski said as Mr. Corzine moved on to the next house in Hamilton Township. She was asked if it bothered her, as Mr. Franks has repeatedly brought up in his advertising, that Mr. Corzine has spent about $56 million on his campaign.</p>
        <p>''Well, it's his money; that's the difference,'' Mrs. Lucuski replied.</p>
        <p>Around the corner, Patrick Treglia, a retired carpenter, offered only the mildest criticism of Mr. Corzine, aimed at the Democrat's strong antigun message.</p>
        <p>''The only thing I hear against him from guys around here is the gun thing,'' Mr. Treglia said. ''We're ready to go hunting next week, so there's that. But my union's for him and so am I.''</p>
        <p>Many people who were out on a mild but blustery Saturday were simply pleased to run into a politician asking for support. Mr. Franks got this reaction shortly after noon as he walked through parts of Jersey City with Mayor Bret Schundler, a rare Republican mayor of a big New Jersey city. Trailing about 20 supporters, Mr. Franks darted in and out of stores, shaking hands.</p>
        <p>''He's the best game in town, because he can deliver what he promises with concentration on the common person's best interest,'' said Joe Frank, a Jersey City employee. ''The other thing is that you don't see too many candidates in this area, so that's refreshing.''</p>
