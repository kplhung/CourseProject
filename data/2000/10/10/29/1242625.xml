        <p>FOR Santo Romano, whose restaurant, Red Rose, has been serving linguine and veal in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, for 17 years, the computer age has officially arrived.

        <p>FOR Santo Romano, whose restaurant, Red Rose, has been serving linguine and veal in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, for 17 years, the computer age has officially arrived. Since late summer, customers have been able to reserve tables at his establishment over the Internet by way of www .foodline.com, an online reservation system with restaurants in 25 metropolitan areas around the country.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Romano joined the Foodline network early last month, the online rush has been minimal. In fact, it has been zero. But Mr. Romano says he is not discouraged. ''We've just scratched the surface with the Internet,'' he said. ''The way the world is evolving, I guess you have to be part of it.''</p>
        <p>Slowly -- very slowly, in fact -- restaurants are wiring themselves to the Internet lifeline, with the idea that customers will be able to make reservations on sites like www.foodline.com and www.opentable.com at any time of the day or night. If the Red Rose is any indication, the view today is cloudy, but the forecast is considerably sunnier.</p>
        <p>''It's fair to say that things are going a bit slower than everyone expected,'' said Alan Liddle, the senior technology writer for Nation's Restaurant News, a trade publication. He estimates that Opentable and Foodline have fewer than 1,000 restaurants already online between them, though they say 2,000 have signed up.</p>
        <p>As in so many things digital, though, San Francisco is an exception. Opentable, the biggest of the nationwide operations, reports that 36 restaurants in the Bay Area are booking at least 15 percent of their daily business online. E &amp; O Trading Company, a large Southeast Asian grill near San Francisco's financial district, says 35 percent of its reservations are made over the Internet.</p>
        <p>For the restaurants, the primary benefit is that the computer is a much better repository for consumer information than handwritten reservation books.</p>
        <p>''It helps us build a database for our guests, and it's building a great rapport,'' said Felix Torricer, director of special events for E &amp; O. ''We have all this information and they're amazed and flattered: 'So, Mr. John Doe, would you like that same table, and would you like that bottle of Veuve Clicquot waiting?' ''</p>
        <p>For the consumer the choices so far are slim. Opentable.com now lists about 80 participating restaurants in the New York City area, with another 60 or so ''coming soon.'' Visions of bypassing endless busy signals at the most popular restaurants seem hopelessly utopian, since so few of these restaurants have signed up.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's figured out a way to get into an overbooked restaurant,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant in New York. ''It's still easier to get your high-powered assistant to do it or to get on the phone yourself.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Tim Zagat, czar of the Zagat Surveys empire, is betting that online reservation systems will be the way of the future. Zagat Surveys has invested in both Open table and Foodline, and Mr. Zagat said that his Web site, zagat.com, is linked to almost every reservation system. But he said it might take some time before consumers began to see benefits.</p>
        <p>''The companies working at it are having more trouble gaining traction than I expected,'' Mr. Zagat said. ''The average customer is unlikely to be using it until they see it has almost every restaurant that they want.''</p>
        <p>For their part, many restaurants are waiting to see how the business develops. ''The focus has been to see which company can actually get these systems into enough restaurants to make it worth the consumer's while,'' said Danny Meyer, whose restaurants in New York include Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern and 11 Madison Park, and who is on the board of Opentable. ''In San Francisco, Opentable found that after eight months it hit critical mass. Consumers wouldn't use it unless it was in enough restaurants, and restaurants wouldn't join unless consumers were using it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer has been using Opentable to take reservations at 11 Madison for four months and recently began using it at Union Square Cafe. ''At 11 Madison, we're already up to about 10 percent now.''</p>
        <p>Some restaurateurs object to computerizing an essentially personal business. ''You can't do better than personal moments shared by people,'' said Marco Maccioni, co-owner of Osteria del Circo in New York and whose family owns Le Cirque 2000 and Le Cirque in Las Vegas. Still, while Mr. Maccioni's father, Sirio, has rejected an online system at Le Cirque, Marco Maccioni signed up with eseated.com because he admired its personalized system, which recognized handwriting. Trouble is, Eseated was undercut by the recent stock market rumbles and has gone out of business.</p>
        <p>''They were undercapitalized and couldn't get the money,'' said Mr. Wolf, who had advised Eseated.</p>
        <p>The real benefits may be down the road, as more and more restaurants sign up.  Opentable is trying to place itself on travel Web sites like Sabre, Galileo and Amadeus so that people can make restaurant reservations as they book airlines and rental cars, said Jeff Edwards, Opentable's chief executive. Opentable is also forging links with organizations abroad so that travelers can reserve in restaurants in London or Paris. And soon, people who reserve tables online may receive bonus points that they will be able to redeem at restaurants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zagat said that online systems in Japan and Europe are a year or two behind those in the United States, but that he envisioned a day when you can reserve tables in Paris from New York through a Web-connected cell phone or Palm Pilot.</p>
        <p>And if more restaurants do sign up, and people begin to use the Internet for reservations in large numbers, small-restaurant visionaries like Mr. Romano of Red Rose will be glad they joined in.</p>
