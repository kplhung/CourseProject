        <p>An F.B.I. agent who helped investigate how the New York Police Department handles brutality cases was arrested last month on federal charges that he filed a false report to cover up the actions of officers accused of brutality in a Washington suburb five years ago.</p>
        <p>The indictment of the agent, Brian Rich, was unsealed on Sept. 20 in United States District Court in Greenbelt, Md., and stems from an incident that took place in Takoma Park, Md., in 1995. At the time, Mr. Rich was a detective with the Police Department in Takoma Park, a community of about 18,000 just outside Washington.</p>
        <p>The indictment charges Mr. Rich with filing a false police report after two other officers released a police dog on two burglary suspects who had already surrendered without resistance. The indictment also charges that he pursued unsupported burglary charges against the men and failed to report the abuse he witnessed.</p>
        <p>The two other officers were charged with conspiracy and violating the suspects' civil rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rich was one of the F.B.I. agents assigned to help collect the great mass of data that has been reviewed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn during their three-year civil rights investigation into how the New York Police Department handles brutality cases.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors, from the office of Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, have said they found that the New York Police Department's failure to aggressively investigate and discipline officers in excessive-force cases helped foster a culture of abuse.</p>
        <p>For more than a year, prosecutors in Ms. Lynch's office have been negotiating with the city over proposed reforms. Her office and the city have reached some agreement on several important changes, but among the sticking points has been the mechanism that would be used to enforce them.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors want any agreement to be enforced by a consent decree signed by a federal judge. The city favors an oversight plan in which the mayor would appoint a monitor. Under that plan, in the event of an irreconcilable disagreement between the parties, prosecutors could sue to impose a federal monitor.</p>
        <p>An aide said Ms. Lynch would have no comment on Mr. Rich's arrest.</p>
        <p>No one has suggested that there have been any problems with the information collected by Mr. Rich, who one law enforcement official said had worked on the case for only a few months.</p>
        <p>In fact, several law enforcement officials familiar with the civil rights investigation of the New York Police Department played down Mr. Rich's role, with one saying it was ''extremely limited.'' Another official said the Maryland indictment would have no impact on the outcome of the New York civil rights case, which has been conducted in part with the civil rights division of the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>Bill Lann Lee, the assistant attorney general who heads the civil rights division, announced Mr. Rich's indictment last month with the United States attorney for Maryland, Lynne A. Battaglia.</p>
        <p>Last week, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Kara Peterman, said she would not discuss the details of the case because of the continuing civil rights investigation in New York. ''Our investigation continues to be conducted according to the highest standard of the Department of Justice,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said his office would have no comment on Mr. Rich's arrest.</p>
        <p>Sandra Carroll, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. office in Newark, where Mr. Rich was assigned, said her office would not comment on personnel matters. She also would not say how long Mr. Rich had been with the F.B.I. or how long he had worked on the New York case.</p>
        <p>Robert C. Bonsib, a lawyer in Greenbelt who is representing Mr.  Rich, said his client expected to be acquitted. ''The case brought against him is five years old, he did nothing wrong, and these allegations of filing a false report are garbage,'' Mr. Bonsib said.</p>
