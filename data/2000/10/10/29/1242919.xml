        <p>When Cecilia Lynch sells her paintings on a West Broadway street corner in SoHo, she hands out a 3-by-5 flier with a black and white reproduction of one of her pieces, accompanied by the words,  ''You can see more of Cecilia's work at NYCStreetArtist.com.''</p>
        <p>Not only can you see more of her artwork, in color, at the Web site, but you can also see the work of more than a dozen other New York street artists, as well as their photographs and short descriptions of them.</p>
        <p>The letters that stand for New York City may be part of the virtual gallery's Web address, but the story behind it, like many of the artists represented there, has roots far from the city itself. It was organized and set up by Anthony Wynn, a native of Galveston, Tex., who in the last three years has discovered that he has a passion for art, particularly what he calls ''primitive, self-taught art.''</p>
        <p>Three years ago, he opened a gallery in Galveston, where, he says, he is the only black art dealer and the art is ''not so universal.'' A year later he began painting, under the name Tony.</p>
        <p>''Everyone encouraged me to go to New York,'' Mr. Wynn said. So in January, he took a reconnaissance trip. By March, he had moved here.</p>
        <p>Because New York gallery spaces are so expensive and because the Web gives people around the world access to New York street art, Mr. Wynn decided to start an online gallery featuring his own photographs and interviews of a certain type of street artist: ''People who want to express their soul on canvas.''</p>
        <p>He also buys pieces directly from the artists, according to their asking price, and resells the work on the site for more ($25 to $4,800). ''I think it's severely undervalued on the street,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''In most cases, it's kind of like a deal with us,'' Mr. Wynn said of his relationship with the artists. ''As I sell more, I go back and buy more.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wynn, whose own work is prominent on the site, said the artists like the exposure. ''They're part of something now,'' he added, ''instead of being out there and on their own.''</p>
        <p>The site is also ''for the person who wants to buy this kind of art,'' Mr. Wynn said, ''but can't go to New York or couldn't find it once they got there.''</p>
        <p>When customers get in touch with Mr. Wynn, he secures their charge card number and sends them the requested piece so they can review it for 30 days.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Wynn is back in Galveston for the winter, he plans to update the site. He may have a show at his gallery there to introduce his New York collection to the area, and he may one day open a New York gallery. ''I don't know if I want to do LondonStreetArtist.com and Paris StreetArtist.com,'' Mr. Wynn said.</p>
        <p>Besides, he said, New York ''is just the place for art.''</p>
