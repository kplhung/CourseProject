        <p>Under the protection of the NATO peacekeepers who in effect freed them from Serbian rule, jubilant Kosovo Albanians swarmed around polling places today to take part in what they saw as the first genuinely free vote they had ever enjoyed.</p>
        <p>Donning their best clothes to tramp through mud or ride horse carts and tractors to village schoolhouses and other buildings hastily converted into polling places, the Albanians cast ballots in municipal elections organized by the foreign administrators who run Kosovo and see the vote today as the first step toward creating a government for the province.</p>
        <p>''This day is itself a celebration, a special celebration,'' said Sokol Statofci, an election observer for the Democratic League of Kosovo, the Kosovo Albanians' biggest party, in a polling place on the edge of the capital, Pristina. ''I am very happy. It is the first time I am able to vote freely in elections that are mine.''</p>
        <p>The mood was completely different among the dwindling Serbian population, now estimated at around 80,000 people. Almost none of them registered to participate in the vote, arguing that continuing Albanian violence and harassment afforded neither the freedom of movement nor the security required to vote.</p>
        <p>Even though they were only choosing local officials to run municipal authorities, most Albanians said the vote was proof of their freedom from Belgrade's rule and confirmation of their right to independence -- a right that is not acknowledged by the United Nations Security Council resolution governing the foreign presence in Kosovo, nor by foreign governments or the Yugoslav federation, of which Kosovo is still formally a part.</p>
        <p>In 1989, riding a wave of nationalism, Slobodan Milosevic, then the president of Serbia, stripped Kosovo's Albanians of the autonomy granted them under Communist rule in 1974. In 1990, Albanians were either fired or quit their state jobs, and ran their own schools, hospitals and even -- in 1992 -- makeshift elections, while Serbia and its security forces formally ruled the province.</p>
        <p>To Kosovo Albanians, therefore, today was the first time any of them had voted free of Communist or Serbian rule. ''This is a free vote for independence and democracy in Kosovo,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the Democratic League of Kosovo.</p>
        <p>His biggest rival, Hashim Thaci, who led the armed rebellion by the Kosovo Liberation Army and now heads the Democratic Party of Kosovo, had much the same message.</p>
        <p>''I fully believe that the international community very soon will recognize the right of Kosovo to be independent as a state of all citizens of equal rights,'' he told journalists.</p>
        <p>Illustrating how far apart the Serbs and Albanians are, there was not one Albanian political party taking part today that does not support independence. ''The elections are clearly Albanian ones, and as far as Serbia and Yugoslavia are concerned, they are totally invalid and illegitimate,'' Zivorad Igic, a senior official of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party in Belgrade, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Milosevic has been ousted as Yugoslav president and a new leader, Vojislav Kostunica, favors a more moderate Serbian nationalism, few if any Serbian politicians would publicly renounce their claim to Kosovo.</p>
        <p>However, there were signs that the Kosovo Serbs might rethink their boycott. Dr. Bernard Kouchner, head of the United Nations administration in Kosovo, said this week that in coming months local elections will probably take place in four municipalities -- of 30 in all -- that are dominated by Serbs.</p>
        <p>Although the Serbs boycotted, several parties representing minority groups -- mostly Gypsies, Turks and Muslim Slavs -- did take part.</p>
        <p>Some 40,000 peacekeepers, who took control of Kosovo in June last year as Serbian forces withdrew after 78 days of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and 6,000 United Nations and local police were out to prevent any violence. In the divided city of Mitrovica, they escorted Albanians living in the Serb-dominated north of the town to vote.</p>
        <p>But across the province, the mood was mostly relaxed, if chaotic. Voting places opened late and were disorganized. Several were still swamped at 7 p.m., and forced to stay open well beyond the 12 hours allotted for voting. Some people, including the wife of Mr. Rugova, found they were not on voting lists.</p>
        <p>In the all-Albanian village of Trstenik, an Italian policeman lost his temper and cursed at the unruly crowd. But as he marched a young man off to the back of the line, the villagers began to giggle.</p>
        <p>Trstenik lies in Drenica, a region of central Kosovo where the desire for independence burns strongest.</p>
        <p>Inhabitants recalled their very different elections in 1992, when the Albanians staged a parallel vote to organized Serbian elections that they boycotted. The Albanians voted then in private houses, and their appointed election officials went from home to home to collect the ballots.</p>
        <p>''Then we had people standing guard outside to watch for the police and if they came we would run away,'' said Haradin Kuqica, 27. ''At one place, the police confiscated all the ballots.''</p>
        <p>He and several friends arrived at mid-morning to find some 200 people still waiting outside the school. ''It would be better to go back to voting in private houses,'' joked one.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Mr. Kuqica said. ''We waited with impatience all these years. If there is a need we will wait all night.''</p>
        <p>''All these people were in the woods,'' he said, describing how -- first during 1998, when the rebellion against Serbian rule began in earnest and the Serbs retaliated with brutal expulsions, and then during the war in 1999 -- the villagers fled their homes. ''So we are happy, and they can queue up as long as it takes.''</p>
        <p>The election campaign was marred by some violence. Two members of Mr. Rugova's party were shot dead earlier in the year, apparently in political assassinations attributed by some Albanians to Mr. Thaci's party, many of whose members are former rebel fighters and have been accused of using violence and threats to seize power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rugova led a movement of passive resistance against the Serbian police rule of Mr. Milosevic and has for the last 10 years been seen by most Kosovo Albanians as their leader. His party, a moderate group largely led by educated professionals with a broad grass-roots organization, is expected to do the best in the vote, especially in the towns.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rugova's once unsurpassed position has slipped since younger Albanians grew impatient and started taking up arms in 1997 to fight Serbian forces.</p>
        <p>Election violence has waned in recent weeks, with incidents reported in the campaign's final days amounting to someone cutting the loudspeakers as Mr. Rugova was speaking at a rally in western Kosovo and a fist fight breaking out between supporters of the two parties.</p>
        <p>There have been reports of voter intimidation but most people asked said they felt free to choose their favorites. Mr. Statofci, the election observer from Mr. Rugova's party on the outskirts of Pristina, said no one felt under pressure to vote one way or another.</p>
        <p>''This is important,'' said Have Dvoreni, who came with her family to vote. ''We are all invited to come and choose who we want, the big and small. After this vote we are hoping for a better future, no more fear, no more obstacles.''</p>
