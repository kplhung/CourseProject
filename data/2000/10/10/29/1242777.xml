        <p>THE Jersey City-based band Better Off Dead mightily resists efforts to label its down-and-dirty mix of musical styles.</p>
        <p>While band members might sing songs about wild times and get their audiences dancing, they do not like to be called a party band. And though many of their songs are grounded in blues, they also dislike the blues band moniker.</p>

        <p>THE Jersey City-based band Better Off Dead mightily resists efforts to label its down-and-dirty mix of musical styles.</p>
        <p>While band members might sing songs about wild times and get their audiences dancing, they do not like to be called a party band. And though many of their songs are grounded in blues, they also dislike the blues band moniker.</p>
        <p>''We are so much more than that,'' said V. D. King, the band's guitarist and songwriter.</p>
        <p>They rock the clubs, restaurants and dives where they play, so are they a rock band? (''No, we're more than that.'') Rockabilly and swing? ''We're not going to start wearing zoot suits just because it's the trend,'' Mr. King said, ''but we are going to incorporate swing into our music in our own individual way.''</p>
        <p>Even R&amp;B, a label they approve, needs a disclaimer: ''We're the original style of rhythm and blues, not the R&amp;B that's on the charts now.</p>
        <p>''We don't follow fashion, but we have style,'' said Mr. King, who will, when pressed hard, say that ''raw, rootsy American'' music is a description that describes the quintet just fine.</p>
        <p>Rather than take Mr. King's word for it, people can make up their own minds about the five-year-old band, whose members include Don Kenny (guitar), Arthur Zo (bass) and Tim Cassidy (harp)  and Bob Masucci (drums).</p>
        <p>Better Off Dead will be performing, as the Scotland Yardbirds, at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday at Scotland Yard, 72 Hudson Place, Hoboken. There is no charge for admission. Information: (201) 222-9273.</p>
