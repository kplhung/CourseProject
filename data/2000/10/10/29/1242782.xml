        <p>IT was a bright and beautiful afternoon on Ferry Street in the Ironbound last Saturday. People were out shopping,  Halloween decorations were up in the store windows, and the television sets in the cafes were tuned to the soccer games from Lisbon.</p>
        <p>Around 2 p.m., a Rutgers University van pulled up not far from the Padaria Brasileira Brazilian Bakery and a tall, trim man got out to take a walk along with his wife, and several other people. Suddenly it was no longer just another weekend.</p>
        <p>''It's Saramago!,'' the baker, Farid Jordy, cried as he rushed outside, .</p>
        <p>Jose Saramago, winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in literature, had come to Newark, home to 40,000 people of Portuguese descent and 10,000 Brazilians. He had been invited by Rutgers University in Newark, to speak  as part of the celebration of the campus's new Portuguese studies program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordy, the baker, wanted to mark the occasion by sending a loaf of Portuguese cheese bread to Mr. Saramago's hotel room. And when the writer went to the Newark Museum, an attendant who said that her grandfather was from the Cape Verde Islands in Portugal told Mr. Saramago she would never forget his visit. That was the kind of weekend the 78-year-old writer had,  applause and more applause, bouquets, handshakes and autographs, as the Ironbound embraced a hero.</p>
        <p>''The year of 1998 was for Portuguese literature a moment of glory, and I personally would like to thank him for hours of pleasure I spent reading his novels,'' said Paulo Neves Pocinho, the Portuguese Consul General in Newark, speaking at Rutgers University the following day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saramago has written 10 novels, many of them magical parables about politics, ethics and the nature of reality. Among his best known are ''Blindness,'' ''The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'' and ''Baltasar and Blimunda.'' Another novel, ''All the Names,'' the story of a civil servant in a grotesque hall of records, was published in this country just last month.</p>
        <p>The author -- who grew up on a farm outside Lisbon, who did not have enough  money to finish high school, who had to educate himself while training to be a mechanic, who left Portugal to live in Spain because of government censorship -- does not seem comfortable with all the adulation.</p>
        <p>After signing the guest book at the Sports Club Portugues on Prospect Street and touring the museum upstairs with its treasures of Portuguese culture including busts of Vasco da Gama, ship models and a mosaic of Henry the Navigator, Mr. Saramago went downstairs to talk to the crowd waiting for him, including club members, neighbors and children from the Escola Luis de Camoes, the Portuguese after-school program.</p>
        <p>''Many thanks,'' he said in Portuguese. ''Come closer. Thank you for the manner in which you have welcomed me. Maybe one day I will be able to explain how I feel. I'm a writer, not a speaker.''</p>
        <p>Then he urged them, ''Don't just celebrate me because I'm a Portuguese writer. You've got a lot of writers and artists in your midst. Promote the culture where you are.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it was clear that people wanted to celebrate Mr. Saramago. Dr.  Asela de Laguna, the professor of the Hispanic Civilization Program at Rutgers Newark who was instrumental in arranging his trip, called him ''a creator of imaginative worlds that constitute blueprints of the perennial human quest for love, justice, liberty, identity and human dignity.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 5, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about Jose Saramago, the winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize for literature, referred incorrectly to the Cape Verde islands. They were a Portuguese colony from the 15th century until 1951, when they became a province of Portugal. They became an independent republic in 1975. They are not in Portugal.</p>
