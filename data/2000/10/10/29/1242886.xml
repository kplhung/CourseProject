        <p>Linda Maicy Chang, the daughter of Lai Yee Chang and Dr. Chu Jiang Chang of Schenectady, N.Y., was married yesterday to Daniel Jungkoo Kim, a son of Jung-Ja Kim and Dr. Ki-Choon Kim of Potomac, Md. The Rev. Timothy Sullivan, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at St. Paul the Apostle Church in New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chang, 29, and Mr. Kim, 30, are associates at New York law firms, she at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, and he at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson.</p>
        <p>The bride graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and received her law degree from New York University. Her father is an emergency room physician at St. Claire's Hospital in Schenectady.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim graduated from Wesleyan University and received his law degree from Yeshiva University. His father is an anesthesiologist at the Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park, Md.</p>
        <p>The couple began dating during their high school years at Phillips Exeter Academy and have been together ever since.</p>
        <p>''Although we went to different colleges, we commuted, and still saw one another,'' Ms. Chang said. ''We didn't get married before because we both wanted to make sure we were done with school. We were waiting for the right time.''</p>
        <p>Still, after years of dating, Mr. Kim wanted to surprise Ms. Chang. So he decided to propose on Valentine's Day last year. ''The whole point was to propose on a day that I wouldn't propose,'' Mr. Kim said. ''She was always expecting it. So I chose the cheesiest day. And it worked.''</p>
        <p>But contemporary convenience clashed with cultural tradition when it came to choosing a wedding day. The couple looked to centuries-old Chinese tradition for guidance.</p>
        <p>''My maternal grandmother wanted us to get married on a luck day, and my grandma is pretty firm on good days,'' Ms. Chang said. ''We went to a feng shui fortuneteller in the late spring last year. He said we were well suited for one another -- that we were a strong couple.''</p>
        <p>That was the good part. The bad part was that he insisted that they should be married in the Year of the Rabbit, preferably between 11 a.m. and noon on Jan. 12, 2000, a Wednesday in the dead of winter.</p>
        <p>''We were shocked by the whole thing'' Ms. Chang recalled.</p>
        <p>''I asked -- through interpreters -- 'What's wrong with the following year, the Year of the Dragon?' '' Mr. Kim recalled. ''He said, 'I fear that if you don't get married in the Year of the Rabbit, you'll never get married.' ''</p>
        <p>As a compromise, the fortuneteller suggested that the couple have a small civil ceremony in the Year of the Rabbit, and schedule their wedding celebration for a more convenient time. Over the next few days the couple conferred with their families and encountered objections to the proposed piecemeal marriage ceremonies.</p>
        <p>So they called the fortuneteller. ''We gave him a bunch of dates in Year of the Dragon, but he really didn't want us to marry then,'' Ms. Chang said. Finally, the fortuneteller identified the several least objectionable dates in the Year of the Dragon.</p>
        <p>''We picked the 28th because it was good for our families,'' the bride said.</p>
        <p>She added: ''It was only later that we realized that our marriage would be on the 13th anniversary of our first date. A luck day for us.''</p>
