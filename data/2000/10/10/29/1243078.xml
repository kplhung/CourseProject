        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Filled with excitement, my 14-year-old son and I arrived at Yankee Stadium an hour before the gates opened for Game 1. I am ashamed to say how much I paid for two tickets just behind first base -- not only to be close to the game, but because I knew Brady wanted a ball. Four years ago, before another Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, I had dived into the flower garden in Monument Park to retrieve a batting practice ball just driven over the left-field wall. I was embarrassed and bleeding, covered with mud, and security was threatening to throw me out.</p>
        <p>Now, Brady wanted another World Series ball. He had turned a little surly by the time the Mets took the field for batting practice. He had overstayed his welcome at Monument Park. He couldn't get close to the left field stands because 2,000 other fans had the same idea. So there he was at the railing about 30 feet beyond first base, watching John Franco fielding balls and taking throws from infielders.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Filled with excitement, my 14-year-old son and I arrived at Yankee Stadium an hour before the gates opened for Game 1. I am ashamed to say how much I paid for two tickets just behind first base -- not only to be close to the game, but because I knew Brady wanted a ball. Four years ago, before another Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, I had dived into the flower garden in Monument Park to retrieve a batting practice ball just driven over the left-field wall. I was embarrassed and bleeding, covered with mud, and security was threatening to throw me out.</p>
        <p>Now, Brady wanted another World Series ball. He had turned a little surly by the time the Mets took the field for batting practice. He had overstayed his welcome at Monument Park. He couldn't get close to the left field stands because 2,000 other fans had the same idea. So there he was at the railing about 30 feet beyond first base, watching John Franco fielding balls and taking throws from infielders.</p>
        <p>Franco would occasionally toss a ball to little kids behind first base; unfortunately, Brad had lost the irresistible appeal of an 8-year-old with an oversized cap and glove. Finally, in desperation and not as politely as I would have liked, Brady yelled, ''Hey, John Franco, can I have a ball?''</p>
        <p>Franco did not look his way or even acknowledge the sour-looking teenager with his glove stretched out. I tried to explain the pressures on players and their need to focus. Like a lot of my explanations lately, this only made things worse. Then, suddenly, a practice throw went wide of the bag, and Franco scooped the ball and with barely a glance threw a soft strike to Brady's glove. Like magic, all was transformed.</p>
        <p>The next morning, after four hours' sleep in an airport hotel, I stood smiling at my sleeping son; his baseball glove was still on his left hand. And neatly tucked in its web was the lifelong memory John Franco had thrown him the night before.</p>
