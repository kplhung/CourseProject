        <p>With the investigation of the Cole bombing at a crucial stage, Yemen's government is refusing to allow the F.B.I. to question suspects or witnesses, attend interviews with them or move at will around Aden to follow clues, raising fears that evidence-gathering may be delayed or even suppressed, sources within the American investigation said today.</p>
        <p>Yemen's insistence that the interviews be restricted to its own personnel, and other touchiness about the F.B.I. operations here, has raised concerns among the Americans that the investigation of the bombing of the destroyer, in which 17 American sailors died, could see a replay of events that followed the 1996 truck-bombing of the Khobar Towers military housing complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia's refusal to allow F.B.I. access to suspects in that attack, which killed 19 American servicemen, caused a diplomatic furor, and remained unresolved until more than two years later, when the Saudis executed three men convicted of complicity in the case.</p>
        <p>The 40 or 50 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation who remain in Yemen, of an original task force three times that size, are eager to gain direct access to key figures among the 60 or more people who have been detained by the Yemenis.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the level of concern, the American ambassador, Barbara K. Bodine, delivered a confidential letter from President Clinton to President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Thursday urging the Yemeni leader to authorize broader cooperation. And on Friday Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh, issued a statement in Washington that appealed directly for access to witnesses and suspects.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a move that seemed intended to convey a message of frustration, all F.B.I. agents remaining in Aden were transferred Friday from a hotel by the harbor to one of a flotilla of United States Navy ships several miles at sea. The flotilla, including a 40,000-ton helicopter carrier Tarawa, is on station in the Gulf of Aden to support operations to track down the suicide bombers and recover the Cole. About 100 other agents have already returned to the United States.</p>
        <p>A senior American official told reporters today that the move to the ship had been decided for ''a variety of reasons,'' including the need for improved security after a warning of a truck-bombing was telephoned to the hotel on Wednesday night. But the official did not contradict accounts from sources within the bureau's investigation that the agency wanted to make a point to the Yemenis -- that agents denied the right to  ''run down clues'' might as well have the increased safety and comfort.</p>
        <p>Since immediately after the attack on Oct. 12, when two men in a small fiberglass boat packed with explosives rammed the Cole and blew a 40-by-40-foot hole at its waterline, American officials have taken pains to praise the Yemenis publicly for their cooperation and to stress American respect for Yemeni sovereignty -- an especially touchy point in a country that has been heavily criticized by Washington for reports of human rights abuses and for becoming what the State Department has described as ''a safe haven for terrorists.''</p>
        <p>When concern about the restrictions imposed by the Yemenis first became a concern, Mr. Freeh came to Aden from Washington to meet with President Saleh and to visit the Cole.</p>
        <p>At a news conference here after seeing Mr. Saleh, on Oct. 19, Mr. Freeh went out of his way to say that the bureau respected Yemen's right to conduct the probe in its own way. Pointedly, he described the F.B.I. task force here as ''partners, but junior partners.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh said then that the agency was ''very pleased at the progress of the investigation,'' especially with the early breakthroughs made by the Yemenis, including the discovery of two safe houses said to have been used by the bombers and the arrest of a first group of suspects, including a carpenter and welder who reportedly worked with the bombers.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Freeh's visit, those discoveries led on swiftly to others, including another safe house above the Aden harbor said to have been used to monitor the Cole and, according to Mr. Saleh, to other suspects.</p>
        <p>The Yemeni leader described the suspects as ''leading members'' of a group of Yemenis, Egyptians, Algerians and other non-Yemeni Arabs who fought in the war against Soviet troops in Afghanistan before joining what he described as the ''Al Jihad Organization,'' a phrase he had previously used to refer to Arabs who have declared a ''holy war'' against the United States. The actual bombers, he said, appeared to have been Egyptians.</p>
        <p>Although impressed with what one American official described as ''the detective work'' of the Yemenis, the F.B.I. was quietly bridling at the limits imposed on them. American sources said Mr. Saleh had failed to respond to Mr. Freeh's requests that he order the agency overseeing the Yemeni side of the investigation to allow bureau representatives to be present at interviews. Ten days later, the sources said, the Americans are still limited to reading transcripts of interviews, some of which appeared to have been have been heavily edited.</p>
        <p>The Americans have been allowed to pass questions to the Yemenis, who then put them to the suspects, and even to pose follow-up questions after reviewing the transcripts. But that is time-consuming and has raised concerns that delays could impede or even imperil the investigation's success. When the Yemenis were asked about the restrictions, the sources said, they were told that the limits were in accordance with Yemeni practice, and that all relevant evidence was being passed on.</p>
        <p>At daily briefings in recent days, senior American officials are now characterizing the Yemeni cooperation as merely ''professional.'' But after word of President Clinton's letter to President Saleh leaked today,  an official met with reporters and sought to play down reports of a rift.</p>
        <p>''Discontented, frustrated, I think puts too much of a negative spin on what is a to-be-expected evolution of two systems that have never worked together before,'' the official said. But the official would not disclose exactly what was in President Clinton's letter, beyond saying it was ''positive'' in tone and dealt in general with the need for cooperation.</p>
        <p>At the meeting at which President Clinton's letter was relayed to Mr. Saleh, the official said, the Yemeni ''once again reiterated his commitment to support our cooperation, and his intent to get to the root of what happened.''</p>
        <p>American officials have said since early in the investigation that a prime suspect in the case is Osama bin Laden, the son of a Saudi Arabian construction tycoon who is living in hiding in Afghanistan and who is wanted by the F.B.I. on suspicion of masterminding the bombing of two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998.</p>
        <p>But without direct access to suspects in the Cole bombing, American officials fear that ''walking back'' from the suspects to the source of the conspiracy may prove more difficult.</p>
