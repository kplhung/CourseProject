        <p>The interesting Osprey's Dominion '98 pinot noir examined here two weeks ago energized my interest in immediately revisiting the work of both Peter Silverberg, formerly of the outstanding Golan Heights Winery in Israel, who came on board as winemaker in August 1999, and the winery itself.</p>

        <p>The interesting Osprey's Dominion '98 pinot noir examined here two weeks ago energized my interest in immediately revisiting the work of both Peter Silverberg, formerly of the outstanding Golan Heights Winery in Israel, who came on board as winemaker in August 1999, and the winery itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverberg's imprint began with last year's harvest, but he played a role in finishing the plush '97 Flight, Osprey's first Bordeaux-style blend.</p>
        <p>The heavy, tapered forest-green bottle, whose familiar counterparts often carry high-end California wines, suggests that Flight is serious: think $27 (at the winery, in Peconic) and Thanksgiving.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Silverberg arrived, the blend had been created: 50 percent merlot, 45 percent cabernet sauvignon and 5 percent cabernet franc, from estate-grown grapes. He superintended the last phase of the 21-month barrel-aging regime (in American and French oak) and the process of clarifying the wine -- technically called fining -- before bottling.</p>
        <p>His judgments and those preceding his have paid off. The concentrated, hefty wine is a compote of smoky blueberry, black currant (cassis), cocoa, vanillan and spicy aromas and flavors, with a sprinkling of herbs. Encouraged by an hour's aeration in a decanter, the wine becomes an even heartier brew, with its tannins providing a nice edge.</p>
        <p>In Flight, ripeness is all. The parts are still harmonizing, so the flavor effects are kaleidiscopic: the merlot comes to the fore, then the cabernet sauvignon, then the merlot again, and so on. The lingering finish is satisfying; the aging potential, perhaps up to three years.</p>
        <p>(A printing problem virtually obscured the script on the top front label, but the name Flight is found on the rear label.)</p>
        <p>The trademarked word Meritage (merit plus heritage), which was coined in 1988 and is intended to denote a superior American blend made from grapes associated with Bordeaux, appears on the bottom front label. Its presence indicates that Osprey's Dominion has joined the Meritage Association, a California-based organization that oversees the category.</p>
        <p>Numerically oriented critics might well give Flight a score of 88.</p>
