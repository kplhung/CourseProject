        <p>The Mets now know how excruciating it is to be beaten by the Yankees in October. In the Yankees' 16 victories in their past four World Series, all but two games have been decided by three runs or fewer. They beat the Mets by one run three times, by two runs once.</p>
        <p>''They made the plays and they made the pitches,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips conceded. ''But we could have.''</p>
        <p>Phillips was merely reiterating what the Yankees' other World Series victims have said. The Yankees have left teams pondering what could have been by dominating in victories but not in runs scored.</p>
        <p>That seems to underscore the difference between could have and should have. The Mets could have won the 2000 World Series, but the Yankees probably should have.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees are a little better team,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''That's the reality of the situation.''</p>
        <p>But there is also the fantasy, and thinking about it will be irresistible for the Mets this winter.</p>
        <p>What if Armando Benitez had saved Game 1, after the Mets had overcome several base-running blunders to take the lead? What if Todd Zeile's deep drives to left field had gone out in Games 1 and 2?</p>
        <p>What if the Mets' bullpen had kept the score closer in Game 2, making the Mets' five runs in the ninth mean something? What if Kurt Abbott had not been picked off first base in the fourth inning of Game 5?</p>
        <p>''They had all the breaks,'' Mets left fielder Benny Agbayani said. ''We had ours, too. We just didn't take advantage of them the way they did.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees repeated their pattern from the regular-season interleague series in July. The Mets lost three of those four games by a combined score of 10-7. In the World Series, they lost four of the five by a combined  19-16. There would seem to be some reason why the Yankees won seven of nine from the Mets this year, even though each game was close.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's one reason,'' Phillips said. ''I think that as a team, they have a depth of quality players that can come up in pressure situations and get the job done. One day it was O'Neill working a walk; the next time, it was Posada working a walk. Derek Jeter stepped up big in the big game, and their closer was pretty darn good.''</p>
        <p>The Mets were a patient team all year, drawing 101 more walks than their opponents during the regular season. That was by design: Phillips has often noted how much he admires the Yankees' ability to take pitches and make the opposing pitcher work, and he has tried to find players who have that approach.</p>
        <p>But in the World Series, the Yankees drew 18 unintentional walks to the Mets' 10. The two biggest were the ones Phillips referred to, by Paul O'Neill and Jorge Posada, and both started pivotal rallies.</p>
        <p>O'Neill outlasted Benitez in a 10-pitch at-bat in Game 1, and he later scored the tying run. Posada walked on the ninth pitch of his at-bat against a weary Al Leiter in the ninth inning of Game 5, then scored the go-ahead run.</p>
        <p>That run presented the Mets with another tantalizing ''what if.'' Center fielder Jay Payton, surgically repaired arm and all, charged Luis Sojo's single and heaved a strike toward home, his momentum toppling him over as he let go. ''I was flying,'' Payton said.</p>
        <p>The throw was too accurate: it hit Posada in the thigh, bouncing into the Mets' dugout, and the final two runs of the season scored. What if Mike Piazza, the catcher, had been in front of the plate, in better position to catch it?</p>
        <p>''He felt that he would let the ball get to him,'' Valentine said afterward. ''If he would have went out in front of the plate, he would have given the plate to the runner to slide by him. If that ball is a fraction of a second sooner, or an inch away from the runner's leg, Mike would have caught it and tagged him out.''</p>
        <p>Winning by inches and fractions of seconds is the Yankees' way. But the biggest reason they can do that is their pitching. ''They find ways to win,'' the Mets reserve Joe McEwing said. ''Good starting pitching, good bullpen -- it goes to show that pitching wins championships, because every game was so close.''</p>
        <p>With Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton and especially Mariano Rivera, the Yankees had an unmatched trio of relievers to preserve their leads in close games. The Mets' six-deep bullpen served them well throughout the regular season, but the Yankees' endgame was more important in the World Series.</p>
        <p>''In my opinion, if we match up player for player, we're pretty closely matched with their club,'' Phillips said. ''We have the edge in some positions, they have the edge in some positions.</p>
        <p>''Pitching-wise, I think we're pretty closely matched. In bullpen depth, we may have had an edge. In bullpen dominance, they may have had an edge.''</p>
        <p>When Rivera closed out the Series at Shea Stadium on Thursday night, he had thousands of fans cheering for him and the Yankees. The Mets do not own the city's hearts and could not fill their park with their own fans. But even during the Yankees' current dynasty, the Mets have made progress in New York. For Phillips, that alone is something to celebrate.</p>
        <p>''I tend to look at the bigger picture, from where we have come,'' Phillips said. ''It was completely a Yankee town several years ago. We have found our way into the World Series, and battled tooth and nail in a very hard-fought, close Series.''</p>
