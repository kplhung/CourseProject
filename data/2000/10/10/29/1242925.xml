        <p>ON Tuesday, John Paul II will formally proclaim Sir Thomas More the patron saint of politicians, a professional class that nowadays is not especially known for unbending principle.</p>
        <p>By choosing the high chancellor who was beheaded in 1535 for refusing to surrender the English church to the authority of King Henry VIII, the pope intended to set the highest moral standard for today's elected officials. Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, a Vatican official, explained that the pope wants to remind politicians ''of the absolute priority of God in the heart of public affairs.''</p>
        <p>So far, however, the announcement has mainly revived scrutiny of More, allowing elected officials, religious leaders and scholars to project onto his saintly aura their own pet notions and special interests.</p>
        <p>American politicians, of course, have long wrapped their own aims in More's moral authority. Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican and the  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, invoked More (describing him pointedly as going to his death ''rather than take an oath in vain'') to open impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton on Jan. 14, 1999.</p>
        <p>For some Italian politicians, however, More serves as a role model for Latin lovers. Francesco Cossiga, 72, a former Italian president who led an international politicians' petition drive to make More their patron saint, startled Vatican officials when he went off on a tangent at a press conference on Thursday, musing that the author of ''Utopia'' was so free-thinking that he could have contemplated a menage a trois.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cossiga was referring, a bit obliquely, to a Latin epigram More wrote about his first wife, Jane Colte, and Alice Middleton, the woman he married after his first wife died. (''O, how happily we could have lived all three together if fate and religion permitted.'') But the former Italian president spoke with such relish that the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, felt obliged to interject: ''I hope there is no need to explain that Sir Thomas More was not married simultaneously to two women. They were subsequent.''</p>
        <p>David Alton, a member of the English House of Lords, and a Roman Catholic, also spoke at the Vatican press conference, but he instead stressed that More would have been on his side on such issues as human cloning and abortion currently dividing the English Parliament. Lord Alton allowed that he couldn't offhand think of any colleagues willing to die for their beliefs, but, perhaps ungallantly, offered up Anne Widdicombe, a Catholic member of Parliament and a right-to-life crusader, as a potential candidate.</p>
        <p>Lord Alton admitted that More had a ''darker side'' that included a willingness to persecute heretics, warning it was wrong to hold 16th-century figures up to contemporary notions of right and wrong. Mr. Cossiga agreed, roguishly reminding his audience that even St. Augustine ''had a concubine and an illegitimate child.''</p>
        <p>In Britain, some historians are rushing to explain that the seemingly incongruous correlation of one of the best-known martyrs of conscience to one of today's more despised professions is all too apt. Calling the Vatican decision ''delicious,'' John Guy, a professor of Tudor history at St. Andrews University in Scotland whose biography of More has just been published by Oxford University Press, argued that More had flaws that were airbrushed out of the popular 1966 movie ''A Man for All Seasons.'' ''As lord chancellor, More invented what during the Nixon era were called covert operations,'' Professor Guy wrote in The Daily Telegraph. ''He promised Henry VIII that he would not oppose his divorce and then used subversive methods behind the scenes to undermine Henry's efforts to subordinate the English Church to the crown.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Guy was indulging in a little politicking of his own, making provocative statements in the British press to publicize his book, which is actually so evenhanded and thoroughly researched that it won praise from  Catholic priests. Rev. Germain Marc'hadour, an 80-year-old French priest and More scholar, explained that More was a politician in the best sense of the word, ''a man who used his God-given talents and legal skills to serve the public good.''</p>
        <p>THE pope is dedicating two days of the Holy Year calendar, Nov. 4 and 5, to politicians. (It is not quite the distinction it sounds like -- the pope has also held Jubilees for journalists and pizza makers.) The Vatican, which canonized More in 1935, wants to hold him up as a morally incorruptible politician who defended his faith against the usurping ambitions of the British crown -- though of course, he failed.</p>
        <p>Protestants respect More's courage, but they also point out that he symbolizes a rather one-sided sort of religious freedom, namely that of the Roman Catholic Church. Church of England Anglicans do not worship saints with the same rituals and relics as Catholics, but they commemorate More as a spiritual hero, somewhat self-consciously. ''We honor him as somebody who took a stand for what he believed in,'' Rev. John Boardman, chaplain of the Anglican All Saints Church in Rome, explained, ''even though he was profoundly opposed to our very raison d'etre.''</p>
        <p>Italian members of Parliament are not especially known for their rockribbed sense of allegiance -- more than 100 representatives have shifted parties over the past four years. Senator Alessandro Meluzzi, for example, has changed parties seven times since 1996. The senator, however, said he too considered More a role model. ''I absolutely stand on principle, I just don't believe in the conventional wisdom of party allegiance,'' he explained. He offered his own tribute to the politician's patron saint. ''He was a man of great rigor and principle, and he also didn't take himself too seriously.''</p>
