        <p>IN the 14 years since Lily Tomlin won the Tony Award for her performance in ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,'' we humans have done a lot of peering, both outward and inward.

Just a few months ago we completed the mapping of our own genetic structure.</p>
        <p>Whether all this has gotten us any closer to wisdom is open for debate. In an odd way, both sides of such a debate could draw fodder from Ms. Tomlin's revival of ''Search,'' now at the McCarter Theater in Princeton.</p>

        <p>IN the 14 years since Lily Tomlin won the Tony Award for her performance in ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,'' we humans have done a lot of peering, both outward and inward. In 1989 we sent the Galileo spacecraft on its way to an orbit around Jupiter. In 1995, for the first time, we detected a planet circling a star other than our own sun. Just a few months ago we completed the mapping of our own genetic structure.</p>
        <p>Whether all this has gotten us any closer to wisdom is open for debate. In an odd way, both sides of such a debate could draw fodder from Ms. Tomlin's revival of ''Search,'' now at the McCarter Theater in Princeton.</p>
        <p>Many, many of the show's zingy observations about human nature are as true as they were a decade and a half ago -- we're still error-prone, self-contradictory, generally clueless beings. Yet occasionally as we watch this one-woman blast from the Reagan era, an unexpected glimmer of progress surfaces. Maybe we have inched forward since Ms. Tomlin's show was last in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>First things first: ''Search,'' which was written by Ms. Tomlin's longtime collaborator, Jane Wagner, still holds plenty of laughs and insights. And Ms. Tomlin's portrayal of a dozen different characters, each delineated without benefit of costume changes or props, is still amazing.</p>
        <p>The focal point is Trudy, a bag lady who has been trying to explain earthlings to some space aliens. There is also a parent-hating teenager, a body-builder named Paul and an aging feminist or two, among others, and to explain how they all end up connecting would take longer than the show itself. Ms. Tomlin makes each one distinctive, by changing voices and more. Her face has an amazing elasticity that lets her not only sound young one minute, old and gnarly the next, but also look that way. In real life she is 61; at various moments in ''Search'' she is, convincingly, 40 years younger or 10 years older.</p>
        <p>All these characters were, of course, created a seemingly long time ago, and as the revived ''Search'' has made its way across the country headed for a Broadway run, many press accounts have wondered how many of today's audience members will be mystified by references to Debby Boone and G. Gordon Liddy and geodesic dome homes.</p>
        <p>But there is far less of this than might be expected. In fact, for every reference to something from the ancient past, there's a reference that may leave you wondering if it's ancient enough. She slipped that mention of Ritalin in for the present-day audience, didn't she? (Nope; it's there in the best-selling 1986 book based on the play.) We weren't really using the word ''laptop'' 14 years ago, were we? (Right; back then the reference was to ''an Apple computer.'') If nothing else, ''Search'' is great mental exercise, alternately putting in focus just how long ago or how recent the mid-1980's were.</p>
        <p>Where this ''Search'' seems dated is not so much in the details as in some of the bigger things. One of these is the very structure of the show. The way Ms. Wagner's script takes many apparently unrelated strands and makes them connect at the end was once dazzling. That device, though, has been given a thorough workout by ''Seinfeld'' and ''Wings'' and other well-written sitcoms of the last 15 years (some, no doubt, borrowing the technique from this show). So Ms. Wagner has in the year 2000 lost the element of surprise; many of the connections that once seemed so clever are now easy to spot in advance.</p>
        <p>Some of her themes, too, don't pack the punch they did, again in part because the original ''Search'' put them on a map that many have since followed. As Lyn, the feminist-turned-career-woman, sums up her collapsing personal life by saying, ''If I'd known this is what it would be like to have it all, I might have been willing to settle for less,'' it's more of a cliche than an epiphany.</p>
        <p>This kind of thing leaves ''Search'' a bit diminished the second time around, turning it into a sort of theatrical Tocqueville. Just as in Tocqueville you can find quotations supporting practically any view of Americans -- they're joiners, they're individualists, they're coarse bumpkins, they're political geniuses -- in ''Search'' there are witty lines for all occasions. But it may not all add up to much.</p>
        <p>So this time, you go just to be entertained by some good jokes and the sheer talent of the actress. And as you're watching, an odd thing might happen. Occasionally, you might feel a little uncomfortable with the material.</p>
        <p>The script tosses off lines about drug use and suicide and such that somehow ring differently today than they did in the mid-80's. They still get laughs, but they stir something sad in us as well. Even the character of Trudy, the mentally ill bag lady, causes a twinge.</p>
        <p>Call it consciousness, sensitivity, a heightened awareness of loss and waste. It is in this twinge that the revived ''Search'' provides evidence that we humans are perhaps not hopeless after all. Sure, maybe the audience has simply gotten older and more conservative since the mid-80's. But perhaps it's gotten just the smallest bit wiser as well.</p>
