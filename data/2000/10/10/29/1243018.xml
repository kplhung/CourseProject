        <p>In a few weeks Michael, a bright-eyed 8-year-old with apple-red cheeks, will face one of the most traumatic days of his young life. He will sit on a witness stand and try to tell a judge how his 15-year-old baby sitter, a boy whom he trusted, had sodomized him repeatedly this summer.</p>

        <p>In a few weeks Michael, a bright-eyed 8-year-old with apple-red cheeks, will face one of the most traumatic days of his young life. He will sit on a witness stand and try to tell a judge how his 15-year-old baby sitter, a boy whom he trusted, had sodomized him repeatedly this summer.</p>
        <p>He will undoubtedly cry, as he has done almost daily since the end of August. But his parents are confident Michael will get through his story, in part because of the time he spent in Court School, a two-year-old program at Brooklyn's Family Court that teaches young victims of violent crimes what to expect in court.</p>
        <p>Michael's mother said she had feared that he would be unable even to enter the courtroom, much less testify.</p>
        <p>''He's been a nervous wreck,'' his mother said. ''He's seen how people yell on 'Judge Judy' and some of the other judge shows on TV. He just kept asking me, 'What if I cry and the judge yells at me, what if he gets mad when I tell him what happened?' ''</p>
        <p>The ''respondents'' accused of raping, robbing and battering the young victims are other children. They are in Family Court because they are too young to be prosecuted as adults. With little understanding of how courts  work, lawyers say, many victims come to the once-a-month, two-hour class convinced the judge will blame them for what happened.</p>
        <p>So instead of the pretrial interview that many lawyers use to prepare young victims and witnesses, victims' advocates and lawyers send them to Court School. There, the children are  cast in trials as judges, lawyers and witnesses, but are not asked to relive the details of their cases.</p>
        <p>Court School is not all child's play. In New York, children under 10 cannot testify under oath unless they can convince a judge that they know the difference between fact and opinion. Scores of cases fail to come to trial because the children involved cannot convince a judge they understand that  difference. So the youngsters in Court School are drilled on the meaning of an oath and on the importance of distinguishing between facts and opinions.</p>
        <p>But the primary goal is to make the children comfortable. ''Most kids think of court through the harsh images they see on television and in movies,'' said Serena Brownell, who is deputy chief of the Brooklyn Family Court sex crimes prosecution unit and selects the children who attend Court School.</p>
        <p>''When you put them on the witness stand for the first time and they have to confront the person who assaulted them,'' Ms. Brownell said, ''they are frequently like a deer caught in the headlights. Some kids are frightened into silence, afraid that something bad will happen to them all over again.''</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia, one of the first cities to offer a court school, the district attorney, Lynne Abraham, said the program had given prosecutors valuable assistance.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to walk into a courtroom on trial day and discover that the child is put off by a black robe or a big room,'' Ms. Abraham said. ''But with nearly 10,000 cases, you don't always have the time to prepare every child for the experience.''</p>
        <p>Neither Ms. Abraham nor Ms. Brownell has tracked the program's effect on conviction rates. But both prosecutors say children who participate are regularly praised by judges for their calm demeanor on the stand. Brooklyn's Court School, which is run by the Safe Horizon Child Advocacy Center and the Junior League of Brooklyn in conjunction with the New York City Law Department, will begin tracking the outcome of cases using  Court School this year.</p>
        <p>Michael's mother says she knows the program works because she has seen how calm her son has become.</p>
        <p>But the night Michael attended Court School last month, he and his classmates, another boy and five girls,  were noticeably frightened. They sat with their eyes cast down, their chins tucked into their chests and their feet straining to touch the floor.</p>
        <p>But the discomfort faded fast, as three Junior League volunteers launched into a skit about how Carey, a stuffed toy bear, survived his first experience in court. The children sat in rapt attention as Carey was questioned by a volunteer.</p>
        <p>''Were you scared in court, Carey?''</p>
        <p>Another volunteer spoke for the stuffed animal: ''I was so scared! So I took a very deep breath and tried to relax. I only had to look once at the respondent. That was when I was asked whether the respondent was in the courtroom and then I had to point  them out by telling the judge what type of clothes they had on. Then I could look away.''</p>
        <p>Then the children took their seats on the judge's bench and on the witness stand, where they tried to answer a series of questions.</p>
        <p>''What's the best ice cream?'' Ms. Brownell asked an 8-year-old girl who volunteered to play a witness. ''Strawberry,'' the girl said.</p>
        <p>''Is that fact or opinion?'' Ms. Brownell asked the girl.</p>
        <p>Before she could answer, her classmates said, ''Opinion.''</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Brownell asked, ''How many people live in New York?''</p>
        <p>''A million, I think,'' the girl said.</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Brownell said: ''We can't have any guessing when you are on the witness stand. You have to tell the truth and only the truth.'' She later told the children that ''I don't know'' would have been an acceptable answer. By the end, the children, clutching miniature toy bears, were all smiles. Their parents looked relieved.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brownell was still worried. ''No matter how comfortable we make them in here, you can't guarantee they're going to want to relive it on a witness stand in front of strangers. Some of them want to forget, and they will.''</p>
