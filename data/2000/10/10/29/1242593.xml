        <p>GHOST LIGHT</p>
        <p>A Memoir.</p>
        <p>By Frank Rich.</p>
        <p>311 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In 1993, shortly before stepping down as senior theater critic for The New York Times, Frank Rich recalled how as a teenager he had ''sought out the fantasy world of the theater, as so many adolescents do, to seek refuge from a real world that I found inhospitable.'' I suspect that most young people who turn to theater in such circumstances probably try their hand at acting or perhaps playwriting or directing. Rich's obsession with theater was different. By the age of 12, he was regularly attending Broadway and Broadway-bound musicals (not easy for a middle-class kid living in Washington), poring through the pages of Variety, picking through wire trash cans for castaway Playbills during visits to New York City, even making long-distance calls to Broadway box offices to check whether tickets could be had for shows claiming to be sold out. Rich's engaging memoir, ''Ghost Light,'' describes how and why, in the wake of his parents' divorce and remarriages, he embraced the world of the stage so passionately, and what pleasures and disappointments playgoing offered in return.</p>
        <p>One of the most powerful and reiterated themes in this memoir is a young boy's pained recognition that the magic of theater was fleeting: ''The happiness of being at a play, the most joyous sensation I knew, could not be had without the punishing realization of how finite and unrepeatable each visit to a theater was.'' Readers approaching this memoir in search of a conventional ''Portrait of the Theater Critic as a Young Man'' will be disappointed; we are never told, for example, which contemporary critics and playwrights inspired Rich and when -- or even whether -- he thought of becoming a theater critic. What we are offered instead is something more revealing and unexpected: recollections of highly charged and emotional responses to theater from a child's perspective, especially the frustrated desire to relive productions that had been in his ''grasp, then slipped away as they always did, disappearing into memory, where they could be retrieved only in bright splinters that could never again be made whole.'' It's tempting to conclude that Frank Rich's subsequent career as a theater critic -- recapturing in elegant reviews a three-hour blur of light, sound, language and movement -- was one way of making things whole again.</p>
        <p>Many of his controversial reviews and essays in The Times, published two years ago in a 1,000-page collection, ''Hot Seat,'' take on new meaning in light of what is revealed in this memoir. ''Hot Seat,'' which also offers material that one might have expected to find in this memoir (for example, that as an adolescent he carefully followed Kenneth Tynan's and Walter Kerr's theater criticism and that Edward Albee was the contemporary American playwright he most admired in his youth), is recommended as a companion volume to ''Ghost Light,'' not least of all for its increasingly ambivalent nostalgia: ''It seems like only a faint memory now,'' he wrote in 1982, ''but there actually was a time when it was a joyous experience to go to a Broadway musical. . . . There was the ecstatic anticipation of hearing a rousing overture, of feeling that electric charge that comes when the house lights dim. . . . Those pleasures have pretty much vanished.'' Given the intensity of his childhood love of theater, it's understandable why Rich never quite forgave Broadway for sliding into decline -- one might say for having abandoned him -- at just the moment he triumphantly arrived on the scene as critic.</p>
        <p>''Ghost Light'' covers 12 years: it begins in 1956, when Frank Rich was 7, and ends in 1968, during his freshman year of college. Like so many of the plays that shaped his imagination, the memoir follows an elegant three-act structure. It opens with a spotlight on his mother, center stage and in tears, as young Frank looks on helplessly, and takes us through what for him were the wrenching separation, divorce and remarriages of his parents. In this opening section he recalls how his parents encouraged his interest in theater, especially the Broadway musicals that he saw through the prism of his own fantasies of by now impossible parental reconciliation -- including ''The Most Happy Fella,'' ''The Music Man'' and ''Gypsy'': a ''woman and a man fall in love, and it takes the whole musical for them to realize that they really love each other.'' His choice of title, ''Ghost Light,'' is unusually apt (it refers to the tradition of always leaving a light burning onstage in an otherwise dark theater, to keep the ghosts at bay). For the lonely, sleepless boy, terrified of the dark, theater was a reassuring night light.</p>
        <p>The second act focuses on his blossoming devotion to the stage, which was complicated by the fact that his chance to see plays was now contingent on the generosity of his unpredictable stepfather, who shared Frank's love of theater but was also physically and verbally abusive. Thanks to his stepfather he was taken regularly to productions at Washington's National Theater, where many Broadway-bound plays got a tune-up, and, increasingly, to the center of his adolescent universe, Broadway itself. By the time Frank was a teenager he had developed an extraordinary grasp of what made theater tick. The memoir makes clear that anyone aspiring to be a great critic of the Broadway stage had best fall in love with theater early on. ''Ghost Light'' also shows why we won't be reading critics the likes of Frank Rich again soon. His formative experience in the 1960's -- seeing Broadway shows for a few dollars a seat, at a time when a score of new plays opened every year -- is no longer possible, given the exorbitant ticket prices on a Broadway dominated by numbing revivals and superficial Disney-inspired fare.</p>
        <p>The final act, in which the memoir takes a more reticent turn, is a bit of a letdown. He moves from theater outsider to insider after he is hired as a ticket collector at the National Theater (a job that allowed him the luxury of observing the same production again and again), forms friendships with others equally committed to theater and is admitted to Harvard. Those familiar with Rich's current columns on the national political scene may be surprised to discover that the dramatic events that rocked this nation in the 1960's -- assassinations, the struggle for civil rights, the sexual revolution, the war in Vietnam -- are presented here as little more than a painted backdrop. Wasn't he at all concerned as an 18-year-old in 1968 about the draft? As unlikely as it seems, was he simply uninterested at this age in politics and social change? Insofar as the Broadway hits that he admired -- like ''Hello, Dolly!'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof'' -- were already belated, increasingly out of step with contemporary politics and music, his silence in these pages on the gap between the art that he loved and the transformations in the world around him leaves much unanswered -- especially since nobody has written more eloquently about this gap, elsewhere, than he.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the book, the ostensible moral of the story is offered, a bit heavy-handedly: ''The theater had showered me with love, but I had yet to learn how to love anything but it.'' The ''had yet'' is a bit of a tease. The presumption is that he was subsequently able to love others -- we learn as much in the acknowledgments that follow -- but he doesn't hint at what enabled him to get beyond this impasse. In the closing pages he leaps forward in time, describing the deaths of his mother and stepfather, revealing information about their lives he learned only as an adult (including the fact that his stepfather had hated his own stepfather), and reflecting upon their impact on his own life. These are among the best pages in the book and leave the reader hungry for more of this kind of retrospection.</p>
        <p>For Frank Rich, growing up also meant outgrowing his dependence on theater. But as ''Ghost Light'' makes clear, his gratitude toward the stage that nurtured him, and his deep appreciation of its magic, remain undiminished.</p>
