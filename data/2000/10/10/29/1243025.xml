        <p>The question of government services for poor families and children has largely been absent from the United States Senate campaign trail in New York. And yet it is among the  most vexing issues that the next senator will have to face.</p>
        <p>In 2002, when the federal welfare program comes up for reauthorization, Congress must decide whether to preserve, raise or reduce current funding levels and assess the circumstances of those who have yet to move from welfare to work. Many Republicans are likely to call for a reduction in funding for Temporary Aid to Needy Families, citing in particular the large drop in the nation's welfare rolls and the substantial surpluses that the decreases have generated over the last three years.</p>
        <p>So far, neither the Democratic nor the Republican candidate has said much on the subject. In his stump speeches, Representative Rick A. Lazio has been virtually silent on welfare, and Hillary Rodham Clinton has said little beyond praising her husband's success in ''ending welfare as we know it.''</p>
        <p>But in recent interviews, remarks by the candidates or their spokesmen have yielded a somewhat surprising picture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio says he will seek to expand funding for the program, with an eye toward broadening child care subsidies for those getting off welfare.</p>
        <p>''Congressman Lazio believes welfare reform is one of the most important pieces of legislation and one of the greatest successes of the Republican Congress,'' said a spokesman, Michael Marr. ''One area where the congressman thinks it could be made better and stronger is by giving greater flexibility on child care, more money and more flexibility.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton stopped short of taking a position on funding levels. ''That's something we're going to have to take a look at,'' she said. ''We have to take a hard look at the population.''</p>
        <p>She said she would, however, require states to provide a more detailed accounting of how they spend their welfare block grants and press for laws to create financial incentives for states that can show success in putting welfare recipients to work. ''I'm going to be a strong voice for evaluating what works,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As on many issues, it is difficult to properly compare the candidates' positions on government assistance programs. While Mr. Lazio has been ranked by numerous citizens' groups and advocacy organizations that measure the voting records of elected officials, there is no such measuring stick for Mrs. Clinton. But it is she who has made a name for herself as an advocate for children, despite the absence of a voting record.</p>
        <p>She has served on the board of the Children's Defense Fund, the nonprofit organization based in Washington that is famous for its advocacy for public assistance for poor families, children's health insurance and early-childhood programs. Mr. Lazio has a legislative record that includes supporting aid for many children's programs. But he is also criticized for approving most parts of the Republicans' Contract With America, which opposed several entitlement programs.</p>
        <p>And while Mrs. Clinton has said she was a driving engine for measures like increased funding for youth leaving foster care and health care coverage for uninsured children, she also sided with her husband, and against many of her friends in the antipoverty world, on the 1996 overhaul of welfare.</p>
        <p>At the time, Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund and a friend of the first lady's, harshly criticized the president's acquiescence on the Republican-led welfare changes; Ms. Edelman's husband, Peter Edelman, resigned in protest from his administration post.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Lazio has voted to expand Head Start funding, to restore a child care block grant that had been slashed, and to restore funding to the Legal Services Corporation, which represents the indigent in court. Along with many Republicans, he sided with the Clinton administration in restoring some benefits to some legal immigrants. On issues considered important to the Children's Defense Fund, Mr. Lazio voted its preferred position 75 percent of the time in 1998 and 66 percent of the time in 1999. (He earned considerably lower points from the John Birch Society, taking its side 30 percent of the time in 1999.)</p>
        <p>Neither candidate has taken a visible position on the most pressing antipoverty measures, like the revamping of welfare, said Deepak Bhargava, director of public policy at the Center for Community Change, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group based in Washington. Instead, he said, they have worked on more marginal items.</p>
        <p>''Neither of them can be called a staunch defender of antipoverty programs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has sought to make his mark promoting housing measures intended for low-income people, Mr. Bhargava said, but he has also sided with the Republican majority on measures vehemently opposed by antipoverty groups. He supported a House Republican proposal to replace foster care entitlement financing with a block grant.</p>
        <p>In 1996, he voted against an amendment allowing states to use block grant funds to provide non-cash assistance to children after their parents' welfare benefits had run out, and voted for an amendment limiting food stamps to able-bodied adults only if they worked. In 1998, he voted against a Democratic amendment to increase Section 8 housing assistance to families leaving welfare. He is not a co-sponsor of either of two bills, pending before Congress, to restore food stamps to all legal immigrants.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Lazio's priorities can be viewed through his voting record, Mrs. Clinton's are virtually impossible to assess in the boxing ring of the Senate race.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Clinton's record has to be taken on faith,'' said Russell Sykes, vice president of the State Communities Aid Association, an Albany-based group that advocates on behalf of low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. ''She's not had to be held to the public scrutiny of a vote. It's very easy, absent being confronted with an actual vote on a bill, to say certain things. We have to basically believe that you support what you say you support rhetorically.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has lately claimed credit for advancing several social service policy measures behind the scenes, saying that she was not interested in ''getting credit'' at the time, particularly in the aftermath of her failed efforts on health care reform.</p>
        <p>On some of these measures, her influence is confirmed by Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Washington. Among the most widely cited is the 1999 Foster Care Independence Act, which nearly doubled federal expenditures on programs for teenagers who must leave foster care between ages 18 and 21. Shay Bilchik, executive director of the Child Welfare League of America, recalled that it was Mrs. Clinton who organized a conference on youth issues and lobbied on behalf of the measure. ''That was really the first lady's staff that worked that issue,'' recalled Mr. Bilchik, who worked in the Justice Department's office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention at the time.</p>
        <p>The bill, which also allowed states and local agencies greater flexibility on how to spend the money, was introduced by Representative Nancy Johnson, a Republican from Connecticut. Mr. Lazio voted along with the overwhelming majority of Republicans for it.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's role in pushing the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act, a sweeping law intended to speed up adoption, is somewhat contested. Republican lawmakers insist that the bill was their brainchild. Mrs. Clinton and her allies give her credit for its passage.</p>
        <p>Carole Shauffer, executive director of the Youth Law Center, an advocacy group based in San Francisco, recalled that Mrs. Clinton's staff requested that she organize an event where the first lady could talk about the adoption measure. ''She was very knowledgeable about the issues, including background that you wouldn't get from just reading the bill,'' Ms. Shauffer said. ''I have no question that this was a personal issue for her.''</p>
        <p>The measure began with rare bipartisan support, but became fractious over two issues: when and how to terminate birth parents' rights to their children, and how much to spend on programs that prevent children from entering foster care. Some Democrats insisted on additional spending, said a child welfare agency head who was active in lobbying for the measure. Mrs. Clinton, said the official, helped persuade Republicans and Democrats to compromise. A Democratic aide involved in those talks recalled that Mrs. Clinton  was vital in renewing negotiations after they broke down. The bill passed on the last day of the Congressional session in 1997. Mr. Lazio voted in favor of it.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans will claim credit and the administration will claim credit,'' Ms. Shauffer said of the adoption law. ''And I think they'll both be right.''</p>
        <p>The first two articles in this series examined the candidates' positions on education and on taxes.</p>
