        <p>Just as home gardeners are putting away the tomato cages, those at the experimental agriculture station greenhouse in Bordentown operated by Cook College of Rutgers University are preparing to harvest their first tomatoes of the season. The workers there not only hope to produce a steady stream of tomatoes to be sold to King's Supermarkets in northern New Jersey throughout the winter, but they also hope the tomatoes will be as good as any that are picked in the Jersey fields at the peak of summer. The greenhouse, next to the landfill at the Burlington County Resource Center, is in the middle of its third year of operation. Dr. Harry Janes, a research professor and director of the greenhouse, which is next to the landfill at the Burlington Country Resource Center, talked recently about the operation.</p>

        <p>Just as home gardeners are putting away the tomato cages, those at the experimental agriculture station greenhouse in Bordentown operated by Cook College of Rutgers University are preparing to harvest their first tomatoes of the season. The workers there not only hope to produce a steady stream of tomatoes to be sold to King's Supermarkets in northern New Jersey throughout the winter, but they also hope the tomatoes will be as good as any that are picked in the Jersey fields at the peak of summer. The greenhouse, next to the landfill at the Burlington County Resource Center, is in the middle of its third year of operation. Dr. Harry Janes, a research professor and director of the greenhouse, which is next to the landfill at the Burlington Country Resource Center, talked recently about the operation.</p>
        <p>Q. How is your tomato greenhouse different from others?</p>
        <p>A. The tomato seeds are planted in a small block of spun rock that looks like fiberglass and they are placed on tables that are on rollers and easily moveable. The plants are kept to about four feet in height. They are watered regularly with water that is enriched with controlled amounts of fertilizer. The heat for the building is made from methane gas that is siphoned off of the landfill. This not only provides an economical source of heat but it uses a greenhouse gas that can harm the ozone, so we are helping the environment. Now we are trying to find ways to reduce the cost of lighting, which can be 30 percent of the cost of running a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the ultimate goal?</p>
        <p>A. We know we can grow tomatoes that are as good as ones grown in the field in New Jersey in the summertime. What we are trying to do now is to grow tomatoes of that same quality in a greenhouse economically enough so that farmers can do it and make a profit. The reason other greenhouse tomatoes in the supermarkets in the wintertime are not as good is because they are bred to have thicker walls and less gel so they can be shipped long distances. They are picked before they are ripe, and much of the sugar is absorbed into the tomato from the plant just as they are ripening. We can leave them on the vine longer. But we have to be able to produce a steady flow of tomatoes throughout the winter or a supermarket is not going to be interested in buying them. We want to be able to go to the farmers and say, ''This is how you do it to make a reasonable profit.'' In the past, greenhouse production was not economical because tomatoes could not be produced consistently. We have a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration because they want to know what can be grown in the least amount of space.</p>
        <p>Q. Why use moveable trays?</p>
        <p>A. One of the biggest costs is labor. In most greenhouses you have floor-to-ceiling plants and the workers have to move among them. The plants can be damaged and the workers cannot be properly supervised. With moveable trays, the plants can be much closer together and they are brought to the workers. We plant seeds every week, so there are tomatoes ripening all winter long. We can have four times as many plants per acre and one fourth as many workers. Our workers are all mentally or emotionally handicapped people. When the plants can be moved to the people, it is easy to provide the guidance the workers need.</p>
        <p>Q. Is the greenhouse used to raise anything other than tomatoes?</p>
        <p>A. This greenhouse is the only one of its kind. We have the graduate students preparing proposals to use the 2.5 feet of space beneath the tables for growing ornamental fish. We don't know if it can be done or if you can make a profit doing it. We think we might be able to use the nitrogen waste from the fish as fertilizer. We'll experiment to try to find those things out.</p>
