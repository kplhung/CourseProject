        <p>Thomas Briechle, Sept. 30, 2000, Bethlehem Township, N.J.  ''I'm 13. I was playing this skateboard video game that I bought with my own money. When I'm playing I'm pretty much thinking how can I win and what I should do next. It's hard. My hands get tired. They sweat. I'm sitting there all concentrated and if I mess up . . . ugh! I get all mad. I say 'God!' and probably a curse word. It can get intense. My dad gets mad at me and says, 'Stop playing the game and do something creative.' But it is creative. A movie, it's already all set up for you. But a video game, you make it do whatever you want. And it's so fake. That's what I like about it. I guess it's just the fantasy.'' -- Interview by Catherine Saint Louis</p>
