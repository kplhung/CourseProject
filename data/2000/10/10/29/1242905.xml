        <p>NO company buses more people around North America than Laidlaw Inc. Its 40,000 school buses transport more than two million students in cities like Rochester, and its 3,800 Greyhound coaches form by far the largest network in the United States. Laidlaw also operates 240 municipal transit services -- including those carrying commuters in Orange County, Calif., and the disabled in Boston -- as well as ambulance services.</p>
        <p>What many of its passengers may not know, however, is that Laidlaw, based here, about an hour west of  Toronto but doing 90 percent of its business in the United States, is struggling to survive.</p>
        <p>Its bus businesses make money, but not enough to cover the interest on $3.3 billion of mostly public debt amassed in failed growth plans during the 1990's. The company is already in default, having paid no interest on the debt since mid-May. Last week, it reached an agreement with its creditors, enabling it to borrow as much as an additional $350 million.</p>
        <p>With that agreement, Laidlaw's operating units can now keep going for several months. But by next spring, Laidlaw faces the risk that school boards will refuse to keep doing business with a company whose future is uncertain.</p>
        <p>John R. Grainger, 51, who joined Laidlaw a decade ago and became president and chief executive in December, faces a company-imposed deadline of next March 31 for bankers, bondholders and shareholders to agree on a reorganization. Stephen Cooper of Zolfo Cooper, a New York firm specializing in turnarounds,  joined Laidlaw as vice chairman in mid-July to supervise the restructuring and sell the idea to investors.</p>
        <p>If creditors and shareholders refuse to sign on, Mr. Grainger says, the company could be forced into bankruptcy and sold off in pieces.</p>
        <p>Laidlaw took several wrong turns to arrive at a destination that Mr. Grainger bluntly calls ''our disaster.'' Aggressive expansion into ambulance service proved to be a sinkhole, and the company's foray into the waste management business also proved worthless.</p>
        <p>In the quarter ended May 31, Laidlaw had a loss of $227 million on sales of $1.08 billion. That compared with a profit of $168 million on sales of $896 million in the year-earlier period.</p>
        <p>To improve the company's finances, creditors would have to exchange a big chunk of their debt for equity. Stockholders would see their share of the company greatly diluted. (The stock, which reached $20.25 on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1991, closed on Friday at 25 cents.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Grainger said in an interview at the Laidlaw headquarters that he was trying to determine how much debt the bus and ambulance businesses could support, and which investors would end up with how much of the company. ''How that value -- in debt, equity and cash -- will be split up among the stakeholders will be negotiated between now and March 31,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kam Hon, a transportation analyst at Dominion Bond Rating Service in Toronto, cited two factors that might make a reorganization succeed. One is that the school transportation and Greyhound divisions continue to be profitable. The other is that Laidlaw is in such a deep hole that selling off the company in pieces would yield scant returns for anyone with a financial stake. ''It doesn't serve anybody's interest to put the company under when its assets are nowhere near its liabilities,'' Mr. Hon said.</p>
        <p>For much of its history, Laidlaw had steady and orderly growth. Established as a trucking company in 1924, it was bought in 1959 by Michael DeGroote, a businessman in Hamilton, Ontario. Mr. DeGroote added industrial waste disposal and school bus companies in Canada and the United States, then sold the trucking division. The company was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1969 and on the Nasdaq in 1983. It moved from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange in 1990, when Mr. DeGroote retired.</p>
        <p>During the 1990's, while the company continued to buy school bus companies, Laidlaw executives decided that their logistical skills could be applied to consolidating another area of transportation: ambulance services. It made sense at the time, said Mr. Grainger, who was then running the bus division. ''In retrospect, it should have been done more slowly, but when you're consolidating, speed is part of the strategy.''</p>
        <p>With the purchase of MedTrans in 1993, CareLine in 1995 and American Medical Response in 1997, Laidlaw became the biggest transporter of the sick and injured in the United States. But about that time, the government began a far-reaching inquiry into reports of false Medicare charges and overcharges, including those related to ambulance services. Neither Laidlaw nor any other ambulance company was ultimately accused of wrongdoing. Like other ambulance companies, however, Laidlaw had to return some government payments as a result of the inquiry, while new rules led to delays in subsequent payments. Losses began to mount in the ambulance division.</p>
        <p>LAIDLAW, meanwhile, sought to expand in the business of transporting industrial waste.  In 1997, it bought Rollins Environmental, to merge with its own waste management unit. A year later, Laidlaw made a successful hostile bid for control of Safety-Kleen, an industrial waste processor based in Columbia, S.C.; after consolidating its own various waste holdings into Safety-Kleen, Laidlaw ended up with a 44 percent stake in the company.</p>
        <p>Laidlaw added intercity buses in 1997 with the acquisition of Greyhound Canada, followed by the 1999 purchase of Greyhound Lines Inc. in the United States. Recently reorganized, Greyhound remained heavily in debt when Laidlaw bought it for $816 million and assumed its $416 million in debt.</p>
        <p>Feeling its own debt squeeze, Laidlaw decided in September 1999 to sell its ambulance operations and Safety-Kleen stake for an anticipated $2 billion. The cash, it said at the time, would be used to reduce debt and to buy more buses.</p>
        <p>The sale of Safety-Kleen was expected to be routine until employees of the company raised questions about dubious accounting practices. A board-ordered audit uncovered improprieties and, although no charges resulted, Safety-Kleen filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June of this year. Laidlaw has written off an investment once valued at more than $1 billion. Some Safety-Kleen creditors have threatened to seek recovery of a $200 million payment that Laidlaw received from Safety-Kleen in August 1999 that creditors say should go to them instead. Laidlaw, which says the payment was part of the sale of its own waste company to Safety-Kleen and therefore was appropriate, will have to settle any claims before its own restructuring can proceed.</p>
        <p>The ambulance business, still unprofitable, is also unsold. ''We're receiving distress kinds of offers, below what we think are appropriate values,'' Mr. Grainger said. He now says the company may keep the ambulance operations, whose results have improved recently.</p>
        <p>The new bank loans ensure that the school bus, Greyhound and ambulance divisions will have enough cash in the near term. If he can hold the company together, Mr. Grainger said, it will have a good foundation on which to build. School bus contracts provide healthy profit margins, and the school bus division accounted for $72 million of the company's $99.2 million in operating profit for the latest quarter. Two-thirds of the school buses in North America are run by private companies that Laidlaw might want to acquire.</p>
        <p>Margins are thinner at Greyhound, but passenger loads have been rising and, as a low-cost travel option, the company may stand to benefit from an economic downturn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grainger's mission is to work on longer-range plans, even as he rushes to strike a deal.</p>
        <p>''Our job is to keep value in the company, while recognizing the constraints we're under,'' he said. ''I tell our operating people to consider this as a race, but it's a marathon -- it's going to be long and tough, but we're doing it at a measured pace. The negotiating team -- they're in a sprint.''</p>
