        <p>EVERYONE knows the saying about people who live in glass houses and what they shouldn't do. But what about people who live in grass houses, or at least those who build grass rooms.</p>
        <p>That's what Wendi Ohlson, a landscape architect, is doing at her home in Stamford.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ohlson became known for her signature grass gardens in her former home, a lot of less than a quarter-acre in downtown Stamford. Once a year she sent out 200 hand-painted invitations to an ''Art in the Garden'' party to showcase her flower and landscape paintings and the work of other artists. But the big thrillfor guests was wandering through the jungle-like garden of tall grasses.</p>

        <p>EVERYONE knows the saying about people who live in glass houses and what they shouldn't do. But what about people who live in grass houses, or at least those who build grass rooms.</p>
        <p>That's what Wendi Ohlson, a landscape architect, is doing at her home in Stamford.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ohlson became known for her signature grass gardens in her former home, a lot of less than a quarter-acre in downtown Stamford. Once a year she sent out 200 hand-painted invitations to an ''Art in the Garden'' party to showcase her flower and landscape paintings and the work of other artists. But the big thrillfor guests was wandering through the jungle-like garden of tall grasses.</p>
        <p>''You were enclosed by these grasses, and their movement and sounds played into a sanctuary-like feeling -- one of complete removal,'' she said.</p>
        <p>This is her third year in the new house, a comparatively luxurious stretch of one and a half country acres, which she proceeded to tear apart as soon as she moved in. ''I  tore out the whole landscaping,'' she said, ''reusing some of the plants in front as a privacy screen and as the beginning of a room. Then I brought in excavators and bulldozers to expand the lawn and build stone walls. Now I'm creating planting beds in different areas, according to the environment -- sun, shade or theme.''</p>
        <p>The beds have a practical purpose: they help clients envision how their own gardens could look. But they also make a statement about Ms. Ohlson's home. A grand archway sweep of ornamental grasses mixed with other plants points the way to the entrance of her taupe-shuttered white ranch house.</p>
        <p>''It's where soccer, baseball and kickball get played,'' she said. ''The grasses create a barrier like an exotic fence behind which we have a perennial flower garden. It's also an introduction that identifies where I live. The grasses punctuate and draw attention to the rest of the garden. They create dimension and lightness when their long feathery plumes bloom.''</p>
