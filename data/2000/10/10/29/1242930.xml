        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The connection between property ownership and economic development in Peru as elucidated by the economist Hernando de Soto is clearly visible in the history of American home ownership (Editorial Observer, Oct. 26).</p>
        <p>In the late 19th century, immigrant workers here were more likely to own homes than were middle-class Americans. Workers often used their houses as collateral for loans. But this did not necessarily provide for upward mobility; in many cases those loans were used to get through difficult economic times and to buttress wages that were too low to support a family.</p>
        <p>Easy access to property titles may have helped to start industrial capitalism, but that's in part because home ownership allowed workers to survive on relatively low wages. The solution to poverty here and in the developing world is access to both loans and higher wages.</p>
