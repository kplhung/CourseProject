        <p>Nine days before Election Day, a number of newspapers announced presidential endorsements today on their editorial pages.</p>
        <p>The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Denver Post and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette backed Vice President Al Gore, while two Chicago papers, The Rocky Mountain News of Denver, The Orlando Sentinel and The Providence Journal chose Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The New York Times said in an editorial that Mr. Gore was best equipped for the White House ''by virtue of his knowledge of government, his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision-making, and his commitment to the general welfare.'' It said Mr. Gore was the preferred candidate on leadership, taxes and the economy, foreign policy, civil liberties, environmental protection and Supreme Court appointments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, The Times said, was ''not without his strong points'' and Mr. Gore ''has his weaknesses.'' But it added, ''the vice president has struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration's ethical lapses, and we believe that he would never follow Bill Clinton's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the presidency.''</p>
        <p>Taking a sharply different view, The Orlando Sentinel endorsed Mr. Bush. ''Coarse behavior, infantile squabbling and naked greed at the top have undermined people's trust in their government,'' it said. ''That must change. The nation needs a leader who can bring people together, who can stand firm on principle but knows the art of compromise. America needs a president who is willing to serve as a role model for all its citizens. The Orlando Sentinel trusts Gov. George W. Bush to take on those weighty responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette posed what it called the campaign's serious questions: ''Which candidate is better prepared to lead the world's only remaining superpower? And which candidate offers a vision of governing that better promotes prosperity, a strong role for America in the world and continued progress toward the goal of equal rights for all Americans? Whether the yardstick is qualifications or policies, the superior candidate is Vice President Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>The Providence Journal endorsed Mr. Bush as more likely to strengthen national security and broaden prosperity. Governor Bush, it said, ''seems determined to rebuild America's defenses and reassert its power for peace.''</p>
        <p>The Journal said Mr. Gore ''seems prepared to squander much of the current budget surplus on a new generation of federal programs, mandates and bureaucracies'' and asserted that he had ''jumped considerably leftward, running as the champion of bureaucracy, teachers' unions, tort lawyers and other assorted special interests.''</p>
        <p>The Denver Post said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore ''may be equally matched in both strengths and defects'' in appealing to average voters or possessing the better character for the presidency. ''The election, then, should be decided on the issues,'' it said. ''And on the issues, Gore has made the better case.''</p>
        <p>Denver's other major daily, The Rocky Mountain News, endorsed Mr. Bush, saying that he has ''a practical, principled view that the federal government's role in American life should be restrained.'' The News said Mr. Bush intended to aid the poor, guarantee the future of Social Security and, by cutting taxes, ''further liberate the American people and make the government less like a shadow that follows everyone everywhere.''</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Inquirer endorsed Mr. Gore ''because his vast experience and earnest intelligence outstrip what Gov. George W. Bush has to offer.'' It said that Mr. Bush's resume was ''remarkably thin for a man at the threshold of the Oval Office,'' and added: ''His likable manner should not lead voters to gloss over the shaky grasp of policy and the petulance about criticism -- indeed, the general lack of depth -- that he has shown in the campaign.''</p>
        <p>The Chicago Sun-Times said that Mr. Bush, its choice, had ''sounded a conciliatory tone'' in his campaign, ''avoiding the ugly culture wars of recent years and promising to work across party lines for unity.''</p>
        <p>Election of the governor ''would mean a clean slate in Washington,'' it said, and added: ''Bush is willing to abandon old ways of thinking.''</p>
        <p>The Chicago Tribune, also endorsing Mr. Bush, said he would be ''far less patient with schools that persistently fail'' and would ''recognize that innovation is nurtured and achieved from the local level up, not dictated from Washington.''</p>
        <p>It said that Mr. Gore would ''expand a failing Medicare system,'' while Mr. Bush ''would venture an overhaul.'' It also praised Mr. Bush for having ''not given the impression that he has the last word on every problem.''</p>
