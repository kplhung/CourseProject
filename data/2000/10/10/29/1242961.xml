        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Matter of Degree? Not for Consultants,'' (Oct. 1), which looked at how consulting firms are not confining their hiring to M.B.A.'s:</p>
        <p>We are delighted at the attention focused on the wide range of backgrounds that can lead to a good management consultant. However, the article's reference to those who complete a quick course as ''certified management consultants'' raises an important issue. While a 17-day program may turn a physician or a Ph.D. into a consultant, claiming that he or she is certified is as wrong as claiming that he or she has an M.B.A.</p>
        <p>Certified Management Consultant is a certification granted to qualified candidates who meet the rigorous requirements of the Institute of Management Consultants USA, of which I am chairman. As such, its use is restricted to management consultants who have demonstrated their ability to consult to management, have passed the institute's ethics examination, and have been interviewed by a C.M.C. review board.</p>
        <p>The word ''certified'' represents more than just training, whether an M.B.A. or in-house program; it also stands for experience, ethics and a commitment to professionalism.</p>
        <p>Over half of the 2,600-plus members of the IMCUSA now hold the C.M.C. title. The designation is also used by institutes in 30 countries through the International Council of Management Consulting Institutes. Worldwide, there are approximately 10,000 C.M.C.'s</p>
