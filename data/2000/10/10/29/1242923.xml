        <p>IN their decision to split the AT&amp;T atom into four separate parts, C. Michael Armstrong and the company's directors were clearly trying to put some new-economy pizazz into their despondent stock. But the AT&amp;T spinoff plan, announced last Wednesday, only resulted in further losses for beleaguered shareholders. The stock ended the week down 18.5 percent; it has lost more than half its value since May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armstrong is learning an important lesson about the ways of Wall Street. That is, even when you give the powerful brokerage firms what you think they want -- huge investment-banking fees paid not only to acquire companies but also to spin them off just months later -- they can still poke you in the eye with a stick. Downgrades on AT&amp;T stock cascaded out of the Wall Street research departments after the breakup was announced, even from firms that will reap fees from the planned spinoffs.</p>
        <p>Announcing the breakup, Mr. Armstrong said the deal would create ''a family of four national service providers that will be even better equipped to bring American families and businesses a new generation of broadband communications and information services.''</p>
        <p>But even as Mr. Armstrong crowed about the new generation, AT&amp;T's restructuring indicates that, sure enough, some old-economy rules that were dismissed by investors and managers in recent years still apply after all.</p>
        <p>In the heat of the recent merger mania, for instance, companies have been paying the moon for other concerns as long as the deals promised higher earnings or revenues to the combined entities. Paying any price for growth was not only O.K., it was also encouraged.</p>
        <p>But such a conceit works only when stock prices are rising and access to capital is easy and assured. Neither is the case now, for AT&amp;T and its shareholders are suddenly realizing that paying big for acquisitions can be costly.</p>
        <p>In AT&amp;T's case, the costs lie in the nearly $50 billion in debt that the company added to its balance sheet over the last two years when it bought the cable giants Telecommunications Inc. and MediaOne. ''They paid a lot in acquisition costs for the cable franchises,'' said David Eidelman, a money manager at Eidelman, Finger &amp; Harris in Clayton, Mo. ''They thought they'd have the cash flow from long distance to pay off that debt.'' That cash flow, however, has been falling rapidly.</p>
        <p>Some $26 billion of AT&amp;T debt comes due within a year. The company said it would pay down an unspecified portion of short-term debt with proceeds from the spinoff. Even then, AT&amp;T remains heavily leveraged. And Carol Levenson, editor of Gimme Credit, a Chicago-based research service for corporate bond investors, noted that Mr. Armstrong was quiet on exactly how the debt would be divided among the four discrete companies.</p>
        <p>Only time will tell if the plan will benefit investors. But a more immediate result may be a renewed interest in corporate balance sheets, those dull repositories of assets and liabilities.</p>
        <p>In their euphoria for new-economy growth stocks, investors have dismissed balance sheets as not only boring but irrelevant, choosing instead to focus on much flashier income statements. But the flurry of acquisitions by AT&amp;T has meant that most of its net worth is made up of intangible assets, such as the difference between what it paid to acquire companies and what those companies' assets were valued at on their books. This is known as goodwill.</p>
        <p>As of June 30, the company said that licensing costs, franchise costs and goodwill -- all intangibles -- accounted for $85 billion, or three-quarters of the company's net worth of $110 billion.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the AT&amp;T restructuring will bring investors back to earth and remind them that the costs of reaching for growth should be weighed along with the potential benefits.</p>
