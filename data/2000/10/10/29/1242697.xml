        <p>ROOMS With a View'' at the Southport Congregational Church are just that. They're vignettes of rooms with a perspective -- a view of a garden, another room or a way of life.</p>
        <p>The show, which runs Thursday through Sunday, will feature 13 interior designers including Albert Hadley, the show's honorary chairman, who will work with things found in the church's Carousel Thrift Shop.</p>
        <p>Using this year's theme of ''coming home,'' Mr. Hadley said: ''I suppose I will put together as many comfortable, cozy and home-like things as possible, starting with a multicolor checkerboard rug. I want to do it young and bright and colorful.''</p>
        <p>Catherine C. Cleare, a Westport designer, has created a lady's dressing room, dedicating it ''to the working woman, raising a family, with some mayhem in her life.''</p>
        <p>''I thought how wonderful to have a romantic retreat to come home to, to unwind in at the end of the day,'' she said. ''Chocolate bon-bons, bubbly champagne and cut flowers will await, the scent of a lovely bath aroma floating out.''</p>
        <p>A Louis XV-styled chaise longue and dressing table will be showcased against faux wall panels painted by Jonathan Kohrman of Northampton, Mass. His paintings will capture an Aubusson floor carpet as well as wall panels of cavorting nymphs.</p>
        <p>Jackie Richardson of Portmeirion in Southport has been collecting Swedish Biedermeier furniture since the 1960's while living in three different Southport homes on Harbor Road (originally called Water Street). Her ''Midnight on Water Street'' will romanticize the village's past and her interest in Biedermeier furniture.</p>
        <p>A little writing room, ''a very private retreat for a writer,'' is the project of Lynn Scalo, furniture designer and owner of the newly opened Circa 2000, an antiques-cum-everything-stylish shop in Westport. She has designed a desk for her vignette, to which she will add hand-blown Murano glass lanterns and Art Deco panels with round amber and orange glass that is backlit.</p>
        <p>Mary McLaughlin of Westport will offer ''Harmony, Interior &amp; Exterior'' focusing on feng shui, the Chinese philosophy of harmonious arrangement, in a woman's study. Richard Hershner of Historic Design Associates in Litchfield will put together ''The Foreign Minister Returns'' featuring objects that a foreign minister might have brought back from abroad. Ruth Cushing of Greenwich will design a setting for grandmother's 80th birthday.</p>
        <p>The Southport Congregational Church is at 524 Pequot Avenue in Southport. Hours for the show: Friday and Saturday, Nov. 3 and 4, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. General admission: $10; preview cocktail buffet on Thursday, 6:30 to 9 p.m., $60. Information:  (203) 255-4538.</p>
