        <p>District 6 acting superintendent Brian Morrow and Dominican Vice Pres Milagros Ortiz Bosch sign outline for agreement that would ease educational adjustments for migrant children who move to New York City's Washington Heights and other neighborhoods; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The slogan of Community School District 6 is ''A community connected to the world,'' but it might as well be ''A community connected to the Dominican Republic.'' Most students are Dominican-American, and hundreds move each year between Quisqueya, as the Caribbean nation is informally known, and Quisqueya Heights, the Dominican nickname for Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>Given this situation, Dominican and local officials want to ease the educational adjustments for migrant children. Early this month, Milagros Ortiz Bosch, who is both the Dominican vice president and its minister of education, and Brian Morrow, the acting superintendent of District 6, signed an outline for such an agreement at Intermediate School 218 in Washington Heights.</p>

        <p>The slogan of Community School District 6 is ''A community connected to the world,'' but it might as well be ''A community connected to the Dominican Republic.'' Most students are Dominican-American, and hundreds move each year between Quisqueya, as the Caribbean nation is informally known, and Quisqueya Heights, the Dominican nickname for Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>Given this situation, Dominican and local officials want to ease the educational adjustments for migrant children. Early this month, Milagros Ortiz Bosch, who is both the Dominican vice president and its minister of education, and Brian Morrow, the acting superintendent of District 6, signed an outline for such an agreement at Intermediate School 218 in Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>Other districts with heavy Dominican populations will also take part, according to Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who said he has pushed for the program since his appointment.</p>
        <p>Proposed projects include an improved Dominican vaccination program and the development of a Dominican report card that is standardized and corresponds more closely to the city's grading system. Today, District 6 must contend with immigrants' incomplete vaccination records and varied report cards.</p>
        <p>''It's time for us to stop being reactive to the issues,'' said Roberto Lizardo, the school board president.  ''We need to be proactive.''</p>
        <p>To prepare the many Dominican students who may end up in New York, their government wants city  teachers to furnish training and technical support for bilingual and English-as-a-second-language programs in the Republic, said Arsenio Devarez, a special education teacher who heads a city chapter of the Dominican Republic's ruling party.</p>
        <p>The program has no budget yet.  Possible sources of money are the city, the Dominican government and international groups like Unicef.  Both sides admit there may be political difficulties in using city money to assist a foreign school system, but Mr. Levy emphasizes the benefits.</p>
        <p>''It's obviously very much in our interest to get records,'' he said. ''It's also in our interest for students in the Dominican Republic to use similar books and programs.''</p>
        <p>Some participants hope the plan will be a model for others, in New York City and beyond, who struggle with back-and-forth migration.</p>
        <p>''If we can smoothen the transition for students,'' Mr. Lizardo said, ''we will have more productive citizens.''</p>
