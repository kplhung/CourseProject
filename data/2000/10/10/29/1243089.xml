        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>G. K. Chesterton once said, ''The problem with people not believing in God is not that they won't believe in anything, it's that they will believe in everything.'' We're experiencing something of that blind belief in Pound Ridge, and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>This belief involves ''preservation of open space'' as seen in the article ''A Test at the Polls for Open Space Efforts'' on Oct. 22. The Pound Ridge proponents are pursuing this with a fervor that would have done justice to the early Christian martyrs. This in spite of the fact that Pound Ridge is the greenest community in Westchester.</p>
        <p>To preserve this open space the Pound Ridge Coalition is calling for a tax on residents, which they say will be about $200 a year, with a purported lifetime of 10 years. The assessment is indexed so that it could quadruple to $800 per home per year. There may also be a bond issue down the line, and in case nobody noticed, you have to pay interest on bonds and you have to pay to retire them.</p>
        <p>If you live in one of the communities where open space acquisition is being advocated, take a good look at the propositions and the proponents.</p>
        <p>For people in Pound Ridge, if you believe in the Bogey Man vote yes for Proposition I on Nov. 7. If you don't want to kick in $200 a year (or maybe a lot more) and would rather spend it on your kids or a night at the opera, I suggest you vote no.</p>
