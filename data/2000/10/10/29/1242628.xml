        <p>NEW YORK'S chronic shortage of hotel space seems especially severe in the fall, when the city is at its busiest and most alluring. But this year, a collection  of new hotels -- with several more poised to open soon -- has, theoretically at least, improved the odds that visitors will be able to find a room.</p>
        <p>But newness has its price: among the following four promising newcomers where I recently stayed, Hudson was the only one with a starting weekday rate less than $300 to $400 a night.</p>
        <p>Embassy Suites Hotel</p>
        <p>The nightly happy hour for hotel guests, held in the second-floor restaurant, is called the manager's reception. But it seemed more like a frat party on the Friday evening I stopped by after checking in. The long, window-lined room was noisy and crowded, as revelers, casually dressed in jeans and T-shirts, stood several deep around the big oval bar or clustered at tables, drinks in hand.</p>
        <p>''That's pretty strong, but you look like you can handle it,'' the bartender said, grinning and handing me my free gin and tonic. It was enormous, just like the hotel. One was plenty.</p>
        <p>With 463 nearly identical suites, all opening onto a big white 14-story atrium, Embassy Suites, which opened in June, is the anti-boutique hotel. Its boxy brick building, perched at the southern tip of Manhattan in Battery Park City, could have been plucked from almost any suburb. And though the rooms are light and airy, you get the sense you've seen the striped yellow wallpaper and the proudly post-modern, champagne-colored furniture before (and if you've stayed at the new Hilton Times Square, a corporate cousin, you have).</p>
        <p>But the Embassy Suites, where I stayed in July, offers something a lot of other hotels in town lack: elbow room. The ground floor, with its long front desk backed by Pat Steir's witty, electric-yellow brushstroke mural, has a high ceiling and space to spare.</p>
        <p>The atrium, a floor up, is so vast -- and sparsely furnished -- you could toss a football end to end without hitting anything. A huge window overlooking the Hudson intensifies the sense of spaciousness, as does Sol LeWitt's swirling purple-and-teal mural that stretches up the atrium's 14 stories</p>
        <p>The rooms are generous, too. Since they're pretty much alike, the issue becomes whether or not yours overlooks the Hudson. Mine, Room 1203, looked straight down onto a construction site and the West Side Highway. But I could also see several of Lower Manhattan's more poetic structures, like the Art Deco AT&amp;T Building.</p>
        <p>The bedroom easily accommodated a king size bed, a desk and a sleek armoire outfitted with twin closets, all in soothing Clairol hues -- blond, gold and pale brown.  The bathroom, decent sized but frill free, with a tub, a marble counter and rather skimpy towels, separated the bedroom and living room. The latter, outfitted with a club chair, sleep sofa and TV with Web TV, was comfortable but had one weird detail, a big picture window. It looked out onto the atrium, but I realized others could see in, too.</p>
        <p>I kept the curtains closed as I ate my room service dinner -- a crisp vegetarian pizza and scrumptious chocolate pudding that arrived in just 15 minutes on a big tray brightened by a pink rose in a bud vase ($26.55; all meal prices are given with service charge). The next morning, I headed to the atrium restaurant, Broker's Loft, for breakfast, included in my $199 weekend rate (the same room costs $379 on a weekday).</p>
        <p>There, the all-American buffet included  platters of scrambled eggs, sausage, muffins and fruit. I had orange juice, a mountain of succulent blueberries and a western omelet. And yes, it was big.</p>
        <p>Embassy Suites Hotel, 102 North End Avenue (between Vesey and Murray Streets), New York, N.Y. 10281; (212) 945-0100, fax (212) 945-3012; on the Web at www.embassysuites.com. Standard suites from $379, from $199 on weekends.</p>
        <p>Hudson</p>
        <p>It makes sense that this hotel's sprawling brick lobby, with a peaked glass roof strung with ivy and a colossal crystal chandelier, is on the second floor. The slow ride up the escalator, a narrow pathway bathed in acid-apple-green light, helps acclimate you to the weird, whimsical, all-encompassing atmosphere of Hudson.</p>
        <p>When I checked in early this month, three days after the 1,000-room hotel opened just west of Columbus Circle, the place was jammed with hip young things here, middle-aged German tourists there. Word apparently had gone out that rooms in this latest collaboration between the designer Philippe Starck and the hotelier Ian Schrager could be had for just $95. (A limited number, that is. I paid $170 for mine.)</p>
        <p>Check-in was easy, though it took a while to find a room that fit. The first I was assigned wasn't finished; big sheets of plastic covered the floor (the last rooms may not be ready until December). The second was complete but had only a stall shower. ''I'll get you one with a bathtub,'' said the gracious young woman who had checked me in and escorted me upstairs after the initial misfire.</p>
        <p>The third, No. 1210, was perfect -- except that the desk light was unplugged, and neither of us could find the outlet. The hotel engineer located it with a flashlight, and at last I unpacked my overnight bag.</p>
        <p>It was the teeniest hotel room I had ever stayed in, 180 square feet, but also one of the cleverest. A tidy rectangle, it was split into two neat halves separated by a sheer white curtain: a tiny white hallway and miniature white-tiled bathroom in the front, a sleeping area paneled in rich makore wood from Africa in the back.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece was the queen-size platform bed, its white leather headboard outlined with stainless steel studs. A skinny stainless-steel desk and matching chair stood at the foot. And a makore wall panel hid a compact TV, CD player, safe and two slim shelves. A surprising touch was the hardwood floor -- I'd never seen one in a hotel room before, and it was gorgeous.</p>
        <p>The bathroom had just enough room for a porcelain V-shaped sink perched on a trim stainless steel stand. But the bathtub was the showpiece, backed dramatically by a glass wall so you gazed into the curtained sleeping area as you bathed or showered. Too bad there wasn't any bubble bath.</p>
        <p>The rest of the hotel is so big and entertaining, I didn't have to spend lots of time in my tiny room. I liked the high-ceilinged library and its squishy leather chairs. And the outdoor courtyard, lighted by lanterns, seemed straight out of Alice in Wonderland, with a gigantic, ivy-filled metal watering can and assorted benches, thrones, and even a bed.</p>
        <p>The bustling restaurant, Hudson Cafeteria, featuring long, wooden refectory tables, was also amusing. My dinner of stir-fried tofu with black rice and vegetables ($31.03, with a glass of wine) was tasty, but service was so slow, the butterscotch pudding I ordered for dessert was on the house.</p>
        <p>Back in my wee cave, I slept easily in spite of the noise: Up from the courtyard came sounds of Friday night revels. And I knew the precise moment my next door neighbor turned on the CD player. But the next morning was sunny, my room-service breakfast of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and coffee ($26.88) arrived swiftly, and ''Phantom of the Opera,'' the old Claude Rains movie, was on TV.</p>
        <p>Snug under the covers, I phoned the front desk to ask if I could stay a half hour past checkout to see the end of the movie. ''No problem,'' came the reply.</p>
        <p>Hudson, 356 West 58th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, New York, N.Y. 10019; (212) 554-6000, fax (212) 554-6001; www .hotelbook.com. Doubles from $95; suites from $150.</p>
        <p>Sofitel</p>
        <p>From the moment you walk though the heavy glass door, thrown open by a doorman wearing a black and gold gendarme cap, the Sofitel makes clear two things: this is a grown-up hotel for business travelers, and it's French.</p>
        <p>Opened on Bastille Day a couple of blocks east of Times Square, this 398-room hotel, the first New York branch of this rapidly expanding French chain, is new from the ground up -- 29 stories up. But it oozes tradition and reminded me of the well-oiled hotels you see in old movies. This is a hotel where you get a luggage rack in the room but not a CD player.</p>
        <p>The lobby, at once sleek and grand, sets the tone, with marble floors, coffered ceilings and flourishes of ormolu and gold leaf. A vigorously decorated bottle-green sitting room, away from the watchful eyes of the concierge and check-in crew, offers the classic hospitality of overstuffed sofas and leather club chairs, with just enough French Art Deco inflections to have you softly humming ''La Marseillaise.''</p>
        <p>On the back wall of each pale wood elevator car hangs a floor-to-ceiling painting of a French or an American landmark -- the Arc de Triomphe, the Empire State Building. Lady Liberty, the hotel's unofficial mascot, gazes from key cards and coasters.</p>
        <p>If the Sofitel isn't hip, it isn't stuffy, either, and it definitely is comfortable. My room, 1503, a standard with a queen bed that cost $250 a night on the October weekend I was there ($299 to $499 on a weekday), was so spacious the bed seemed to float. With pale cafe au lait walls, creamy crown moldings and chocolate-colored carpeting, it exuded serenity.</p>
        <p>Practicality, too, with a high-speed Internet connection and Web TV. Black and white photographs of the Flatiron and Chrysler Buildings and of the construction of the Eiffel Tower hung near a stylish pair of cranberry armchairs and a big window overlooking a dull office building. The TV stood at one end of the long desk, eliminating the need for a bulky armoire. But why, in a hotel built from scratch, was the closet so small?</p>
        <p>The bathroom was the highlight. Clad in golden brown marble and a chic lizard print wallcovering that would have made a great-looking skirt, it had a roomy shower, a separate tub with a hand-held shower, and a TV speaker I turned up so I could listen to a baseball game as I soaked in the tub. But the Roger &amp; Gallet toiletries didn't include bubble bath.</p>
        <p>In the evening, I sampled the hotel's high-ceilinged brasserie, Gaby, so French that my waitress was bilingual and the menu offered choucroute and cassoulet instead of burgers and pasta. My onion soup and endive salad were good and the profiteroles outstanding, but my table was drafty and overlooked dreary 45th Street. (Dinner was $41.15, with a kir royale.)</p>
        <p>I decided to have breakfast in my pretty room. An ebonized tray arrived promptly, laden with smoked salmon crepes, coffee and orange juice, the latter included with the price of the crepes -- a bargain by hotel standards ($18.97). Too bad the crepes were almost flavorless. With all those French influences swirling around, I had temporarily forgotten where I was. Next time, I'll order ham and eggs.</p>
        <p>Sofitel, 45 West 44th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10036; (212) 354-8844 or (800) 763-4835; fax (212) 782-3002; www.sofitel.com. Doubles from $299 to $499; suites $599 to $899. Ask about weekend rates.</p>
        <p>The Tribeca Grand</p>
        <p>There's no sign or canopy outside the Tribeca Grand, two blocks south of Canal Street on Avenue of the Americas. Unless you count the discreet lettering on the big black pedestal clock planted in front of the new triangular brick structure, which opened in May. Going signless, of course, is hotel shorthand for declaring the place stylish and cool.</p>
        <p>The Grand, on my July visit, generally delivered, even if the hipness at times seemed contrived. Is a disco-style velvet rope at a hotel entrance absolutely necessary? At least the two good-looking guys in black manning the entry acted more like greeters than bouncers and good-naturedly held open the doors.</p>
        <p>Once inside, there's lots to see. In fact, you get the sense you're viewing the entire hotel at once. Walk past the dark front desk, where you receive a CD of Tribeca mood music (house, rap and jazz) when you check in, and you enter a 10,000-square-foot atrium crowned by a skylight and shaped like a generous slice of pie.</p>
        <p>Gaze up at the mustard and burnt orange walls, bordered by iron railings, and you see eight floors of rooms, 203 in all. Back on the ground, a sprawling lounge runs the entire length of the hotel. Part lobby, part dining area, part glass-covered bar, the surroundings are glamorous and inviting, with congenial groupings of big plushy sofas and love seats, cafe tables and chairs. As the glass elevator ferried me to my seventh-floor room, the atrium's contents seemed to shrink to toy size.</p>
        <p>I had been upgraded to a small suite and my room, No. 718, a sleek high-tech hideaway in shades of celadon, gray-beige and cream, was handsome but hardly spacious. The desk, minibar, fax machine and luggage rack were neatly absorbed into a single laminate built-in. A boxy built-in cabinet held the closet, drawers and TV, and separated the sleeping area, with its low platform bed, from the desk area. I liked the floor-to-ceiling windows that ran the length of the room, but kept the sheers closed to block out the industrial view.</p>
        <p>The room, like a smaller one I later saw, was packed with toys -- a Bose radio-CD player, a high-speed Internet connection and Web TV, an Aeron desk chair, a racy Artemide desk lamp. And the bathroom was terrific, with a big bathtub, stainless-steel sink and tiny television, inserted like a work of art, above a shelf of toiletries.</p>
        <p>Cocktail hour was in full swing when I entered the lounge for dinner. Most of the tables and sofas were occupied by cute young things sipping exotically colored concoctions. I was one of the few having dinner -- an excellent sweet pea risotto ($36.39, with one of those concoctions, a tartini -- vodka, Chambord, and raspberry and cranberry juices) -- and definitely the only one alone reading a magazine.</p>
        <p>Service was slow, and by the time I left, the place had emptied out. But it was jumping at midnight, when I visited my floor's coffee machine. Though noise reverberated through the atrium, my room was quiet. Unfortunately, sounds from road repair work came through loud and clear the next morning.</p>
        <p>After an excellent, promptly delivered room service breakfast ($28.88) of smoked salmon omelet, coffee and orange juice (not fresh squeezed, un fortunately), I curled up on a sofa in the lounge and read the paper. I lost track of the time, so it was about five minutes past checkout when I went up to get my bag. My key card wouldn't work: I'd overstayed.</p>
        <p>The front desk gave me a loaner card to retrieve my bag. Maybe the hotel is serious about that velvet rope business after all.</p>
        <p>Tribeca Grand Hotel, 2 Avenue of the Americas, between White and Walker Streets, New York, N.Y. 10013; (212) 519-6600 or (877) 519-6600, fax (212) 519-6700; www.tribeca grand.com. Doubles from $399.</p>
        <p>Three new hotels are recycling classic facades</p>
        <p>They don't build them the way they used to. Which explains why three new or soon-to-open luxury boutique hotels are in beautiful old buildings that were not originally designed to be hotels.</p>
        <p>The 108-room Dylan, which had a partial opening last month, is in the former Chemists Club, a graceful brick and limestone structure near Grand Central Terminal at 52 East 41st Street. The 270-room W New York-Union Square, the chain's fourth hotel in the city, is scheduled to be unveiled late next month in the 20-story Guardian Life  Building, 201 Park Avenue South (17th Street). Also late next month, the 130-room Bryant Park is set to open in the American Radiator Building, a 1924 gold-trimmed, black-brick skyscraper across from Bryant Park at 40 West 40th Street.</p>
        <p>Retrofitting a prewar structure never meant to house overnight guests is difficult, costly and slow, requiring large investments in things that guests will never see, like plumbing and wiring. Each of the hotels has experienced delays.</p>
        <p>And they can be expensive: rooms will start at $575 at the Bryant Park, $335 at the Dylan, and $279 at the W. But for guests craving glorious architecture, one-of-a-kind interiors and a whiff of history, a night in a former office building or club holds appeal.</p>
        <p>Visitors to the mezzanine lounge at the Dylan ascend a majestic, curved staircase original to the 1903 building, with ornamental iron siding and a wooden bannister. The showpiece will be the Alchemy Suite, a Gothic chamber with a vaulted ceiling, slender columns and a 1932 stained-glass window depicting symbols of alchemy. The other guest rooms, designed by Jeffrey Beers, are large, minimalist and serene. Reservations: (212) 338-0500, fax (212) 338-0569; www.dylanhotel.com.</p>
        <p>At the W at Union Square, a grand staircase transports guests from the lobby lounge to a two-story ballroom overlooking Union Square Park. The Beaux-Arts building lends itself to intriguing, odd-shaped nooks and crannies, connected by marble corridors with vaulted ceilings. Rooms, designed by the Rockwell Group in restful shades of cream and cocoa, will have big beds with tall headboards and buttery purple throws. Reservations: (877) 946-8357 or (212) 253-9119, fax (212) 253-9229; www.whotels.com.</p>
        <p>The designs for the generous, ultra contemporary rooms at the Bryant Park, by the British architect David Chipperfield, have a Zen-like simplicity. Hardwood floors and platform beds on slender legs anchor the 1920's building firmly in the present. Reservations: (212) 642-2200, (877) 640-9300, fax (212) 869-4446; www.bryantparkhotel  .com.</p>
