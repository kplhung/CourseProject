        <p>I was left with the impression that Marshall Sella (Sept. 24) favored Jay Leno's brand of political potshotting over David Letterman's. He seemed to find nobility in Leno's Jay-walks, citing them as a ''gentle reprimand to a big, dumb, lazy democracy.'' Gentle? Big laughs at the expense of the dim bulbs Leno illuminates and nationally humiliates? I like Jay, but I often cringe at his sophomoric style. Letterman rather likens himself to the befuddled Everyperson trying to make sense of all this political ''theater.'' Your writer was critical of the way he laid off Hillary after her visit to his show. She happens to be the First Lady, and after a very appropriate -- and very brief -- interval, her head was firmly back on Dave's comedy block.</p>
