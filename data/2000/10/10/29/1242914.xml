        <p>CAMILO MARTINEZ remembers the joke circulating around Wall Street not that long ago: If you want to cause a buying stampede among investors, just insert the prefix ''gen'' into a company's name.</p>
        <p>Dr. Martinez, an internist who is a co-manager of the Dresdner RCM Biotechnology fund, witnessed the market frenzy that began in the fall of 1999, as some genomics stocks started to more than quadruple in value. Investors saw a bright future in genomics, believing that the science, which identifies the genetic roots of illnesses, would lead to the development of lucrative life-prolonging drugs.</p>
        <p>Analysts, though, had warned that the industry was still in its infancy and that most genomics companies could expect to see losses for the next three to five years. By last spring, as the overall market began to tumble, investors began pulling out of many genomics stocks almost as quickly as they had plunged in.</p>
        <p>The sector generally remains depressed these days, even though researchers announced in June that they had decoded the human genome -- a landmark scientific discovery. (Celera Genomics, a unit of the PE Corporation, and the publicly financed Human Genome Project said they had produced a rough draft of the body's estimated 100,000 genes.)</p>
        <p>Many genomics stocks are still off considerably from their 52-week highs. Celera, for example, hit $276 a share last March, but now trades at $67.25.</p>
        <p>Still, several genomics companies are busy going public, with roughly a half-dozen  more initial public offerings expected through this fall. Charles C. Duncan, a biotechnology analyst at Prudential Securities,  said that about three dozen genomics companies had already gone public this year, a rate he called ''amazing.''</p>
        <p>But for investors, picking apart the genomics industry can seem as complicated  as picking apart the genes themselves.</p>
        <p>''A fundamental problem is that people do not understand exactly what these companies do, or what their business models are for the long term,'' Dr. Martinez said.</p>
        <p>Meirav Chovav, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, agreed: ''What we're hearing from both institutional and individual investors is that everything is confusing in terms of what fits in where.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Duncan said the genomics industry was starting to sort itself into four broad camps.</p>
        <p>The first group is the technology providers that supply tools like the so-called gene chips used in analyzing genomics data, along with DNA sequencers and bioinformatics software. It includes companies like Affymetrix, LION Bioscience, Gene Logic and Applied Biosystems, Celera's sister company, which was formerly known as PE Biosystems.</p>
        <p>The second is information providers, like Celera and Incyte Genomics, that compile genetic information into databases and then sell subscription rights to drug companies.</p>
        <p>In the third group are the research companies like Sangamo Biosciences, Lexicon and Genome Therapeutics; they generally operate under research agreements to provide some sort of valuable technology to biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. The fourth set uses genomics to develop better diagnostics and pharmaceutical products. It includes companies like Myriad Genetics, Human Genome Sciences and Millennium Pharmaceuticals.</p>
        <p>SOME money managers say genomics investors have been cherry-picking throughout the sector lately.</p>
        <p>Steven Newby, portfolio manager for GenomicsFund.com, a mutual fund that started in March, said he thought that investors had lost their earlier zeal for companies that sell products like gene chips, bioinformatics software and genomic databases and are moving instead to those that are actually developing drugs. He pointed out that Affymetrix, Celera and Gene Logic were off between 65 and 70 percent from their 52-week highs, while the stock of Millennium recently reached a new high, and Human Genome Sciences was not too far from the high it set last spring.</p>
        <p>''There's been quite a restructuring of investor interest from the spring, when investors simply bought genomics stocks lock, stock and barrel,'' Mr. Newby said.</p>
        <p>Because genomics stocks have proved so volatile, he recommended that investors invest in a variety of companies across the entire sector. The largest genomics holdings in his fund are Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Human Genome Sciences and Medarex, a drug developer.</p>
        <p>Dr. Martinez's fund also invests in Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Human Genome Sciences, though he also has positions in eight companies that are mostly suppliers to the genomics industry, like Charles River Laboratories, a large provider of laboratory animals used in research.</p>
        <p>''Not only do we think that big suppliers are a relatively low risk to play the genomics industry, but many of these companies have been profitable for many years and have lots of cash on hand,'' Dr. Martinez said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duncan said he liked a diverse group of genomics companies, although he is more focused on those that are aimed at drug development. Among his favorites are Celera, Genome Therapeutics, Sangamo Biosciences and Human Genome Sciences. He also likes Curagen and Tularik, which are involved mainly in drug discovery and development, and Genomica, which provides bioinformatics software.</p>
        <p>WHILE some analysts say the stock of Human Genome Sciences is  overvalued -- they are generally cautious about the clinical benefits of the drugs that the company currently has in testing -- Mr. Duncan has a 12-month target of $125 on the stock, which closed on Friday at $88.13. The company had a two-for-one stock split on Oct. 5.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duncan's top pick is Myriad Genetics. He sees it as unusually prolific in discovering disease-related genes but also as an early leader in the field of proteomics, which many scientists generally regard as the next step after genomics research. Proteomics involves the large-scale study of the proteins that are made by genes.</p>
        <p>Proteomics companies have not eluded the radar screens of investors lately. When Ciphergen Biosystems and Genomica each went public on Sept. 29, the stock of Ciphergen, a proteomics company that had just $5 million in revenue in 1999, doubled from $16 to $32, while Genomica, the bioinformatics company, rose just 44 cents. Ciphergen Biosystems now trades at $29.75, while Genomica is at $13.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newby said he thought that investors were latching onto proteomics as the latest buzzword in the genomics industry.</p>
        <p>''I first noticed the interest in the spring, when genomics stocks were down, and investors were looking for something new,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Buzzwords worry Dr. Martinez, who said genomics investors have already spent the last year jumping from one trend to another. Rather than focusing on trends, he said, investors should remember that the relationship between genes and diseases is so complex that the efforts to date have simply been ''a race to the starting line.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Newby agreed -- and recommended some caution.</p>
        <p>''This is an industry with open-ended potential over the next 20 to 50 years,'' he said. ''There's no reason why you have to be right there right now with all your money.''</p>
