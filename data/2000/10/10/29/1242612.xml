        <p>AN AFFAIR OF STATE: The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton, by Richard A. Posner. (Harvard University, $16.95.) There are no heroes in this penetrating analysis of the Lewinsky scandal by the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. His narrative, which assails the political posturing on both sides of the aisle, was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1999. ''In a way only good judges can do, he manages both to portray the ambiguity of constitutional law . . . and yet not shy from judgment about what actually happened and what to make of it,'' Andrew Sullivan wrote here. In Edward M. Kennedy: A biography, by Adam Clymer (Perennial/HarperCollins, $16), the Washington correspondent of The New York Times tracks the long, productive career of the Massachusetts senator, who overcame an unpromising start to earn the respect of his peers. The result is a ''thorough, careful account of a passionately interesting man and politician,'' Godfrey Hodgson said here last year. Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan, by Edmund Morris (Modern Library, $16.95), blends scholarship with imaginary scenes involving a phantom narrator who wanders in and out of the former president's life. It's a daunting leap of faith, but ''a reader who surrenders . . . will be led through a riveting story to a transcendent conclusion with a surprise twist,'' Steven R. Weisman wrote in these pages in 1999.</p>
        <p>ECOLOGY OF A CRACKER CHILDHOOD, by Janisse Ray. (Milkweed, $14.95.) A poet and environmental advocate describes growing up poor and white in backwoods Georgia, focusing on both her family life and the region's fragile, unsung landscape. Her tale, at turns raw and passionate, ''is suffused with the same history-haunted sense of loss that imprints so much of the South and its literature,'' Tony Horwitz wrote here earlier this year.</p>
        <p>LOVE IN A DEAD LANGUAGE: A Romance, by Lee Siegel. (University of Chicago, $15.) A commentary on the Kama Sutra becomes a springboard for an elaborate series of fictional games, which revel in the author's love of language, wildly synthetic imagination and homages to writers like Nabokov and Philip Roth. Last year our reviewer, Tom LeClair, called this novel ''a major laughing matter'' that ''deserves space on the short, high shelf of literary wonders.''</p>
        <p>THE HONEY THIEF, by Elizabeth Graver. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) In this quiet, straightforward novel about the approach of adolescence, a troubled 11-year-old girl and her widowed mother move from Manhattan to rural upstate New York, where they become involved with a reclusive beekeeper who lives next door. ''Remarkably finely tuned,'' the story ''maintains a consistent delicacy and precision,'' Katharine Weber said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>HITLER'S POPE: The Secret History of Pius XII, by John Cornwell. (Penguin, $15.) A British journalist argues that Pius's failure to condemn the Nazis was motivated in part by internal changes within the church and the Vatican's deep fear of Communism. ''By combining the painstaking research of other scholars with his own new documentation,'' Cornwell makes a case ''that is very difficult to refute,'' V. R. Berghahn wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN, by Jonathan Lethem. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) This novel, whose narrator is a gumshoe afflicted with Tourette's syndrome, uses the trappings of the detective genre as an excuse for off-kilter humor, sharp social commentary and an inquiry into the mysteries of consciousness. '' 'Motherless Brooklyn' immerses us in the mind's dense thicket, a place where words split and twine in an ever-deepening tangle,'' Albert Mobilio wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>A BOOK OF REASONS, by John Vernon. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) A novelist turns to history and science rather than memory to solve the nightmarish puzzle of his older brother, whose chaotic life was revealed only after his sudden death from an aneurysm. ''The resulting book is sometimes harrowing, often insightful, occasionally amusing and consistently fascinating,'' Martha Beck said here last year. ''Paul Vernon left a deep mark on his brother's consciousness, and John Vernon has passed it on to his readers.''</p>
        <p>CITY OF LIGHT, by Lauren Belfer. (Island, $6.99.) The headmistress of a girl's school in turn-of-the-century Buffalo is torn between protecting her goddaughter and exposing the greed of officials involved in the new power project at Niagara Falls. Last year our reviewer, Ellen Feldman, called this ''an ingenious first novel'' featuring ''historical figures who mingle seamlessly with the fictional characters.''</p>
