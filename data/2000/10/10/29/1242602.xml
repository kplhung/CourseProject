        <p>THE LAST DIVE</p>
        <p>A Father and Son's Fatal Descent</p>
        <p>Into the Ocean's Depths.</p>
        <p>By Bernie Chowdhury.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 356 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>HarperCollins Publishers. $25.</p>
        <p>For readers who find that tales of audacity and doom set on mountaintops and the high seas have lost the thrill of novelty, here's a new subgenre: terrors of the deep. ''The Last Dive,'' by Bernie Chowdhury, recounts the (eventually) fatal adventures of the Rouses, a father-and-son pair of divers who met their match eight years ago in the wreck of a German U-boat that lies under 230 feet of water off the coast of New Jersey. The Rouses practiced a sport called technical diving, in which divers seek depths as great as 1,000 feet using elaborate equipment and multiple air tanks (often containing mixtures of such gases as nitrogen, oxygen and helium in special proportions). Since most recreational divers stay well above 130 feet, technical diving has about the same relationship to the typical holiday scuba excursion that climbing Mount Everest has to a brisk afternoon hike.</p>
        <p>Well, there is one big difference: it takes days to climb a major mountain, while most deep divers spend perhaps 40 minutes at their destination and hours hovering at shallow depths afterward to avoid decompression sickness -- the bends. When disaster strikes at 230 feet, it strikes fast, and there isn't much time for the kind of evolving, personality-revealing expedition soap opera that made Jon Krakauer's ''Into Thin Air'' so irresistible. But what diving does have that mountain climbing lacks is a wide variety of horrible ways to die, and in Chowdhury those torments have found their bard. He once worked with the National Underwater Accident Data Center at the University of Rhode Island, an experience that made him ''very familiar with the details of every wreck-diving tragedy involving an American diver.''</p>
        <p>He does not stint on those details. While Chowdhury devotes some portion of ''The Last Dive'' to debates in the deep-diving community regarding the merits of mixed gas or what he sees as the need for wider use of underwater communications equipment and portable shipboard decompression chambers to treat divers who ''get bent,'' these are matters of interest primarily to technical divers -- a group he describes, rather proudly, as ''small.'' Like those confirmed homebodies who stayed up half the night devouring ''Into Thin Air,'' the larger audience for ''The Last Dive'' craves suspenseful tales in which foolish mistakes or just plain bad luck leads to hairbreadth escapes or something far, far worse. Diving misadventures -- including the titular one, bracingly portrayed in somewhat conjectural detail -- make great, nail-biting anecdotes rather than epic yarns, so to fill out the book, Chowdhury liberally sprinkles his text with bloodcurdling accounts explaining exactly what's at stake.</p>
        <p>Drowning is the most obvious peril to any kind of diving. In relating the history of cave diving, the sport that the Rouses first pursued, Chowdhury tells of a pair of inexperienced divers who used some monofilament fishing line instead of a proper guideline reel to navigate the pitch-dark caverns. ''Their bodies were found inside a cave system, hopelessly entangled in the strong, clear line. Their arms were tightly pinned against their bodies, their breathing regulators dangling away from their anguished faces and gaping mouths.'' Divers breathing compressed air may drown as a result of nitrogen narcosis, the intoxicating effect caused by the gas as the surrounding water pressure increases. ''Every 33 feet you dive is like drinking a martini on an empty stomach,'' Chowdhury says, not the best conditions in which to face being pinned</p>
        <p>by debris, as Chrissy, the impulsive younger Rouse, was in the U-boat. He panicked, and this may have cost both men their lives.</p>
        <p>THE Rouses had chosen to breathe compressed air rather than mixed gas on their last dive because the latter, which minimizes narcosis, was too expensive. But even mixed gas presents its own dangers -- it increases the time a diver must decompress underwater to avoid the bends. Oxygen, which helps accelerate the decompression process, is itself toxic at depth and causes deadly convulsions, but ''a diver might be subject to oxygen toxicity at different depths on different days.'' Pressure, in fact, is the diver's greatest bte noire, and some of Chowdhury's most horrific stories concern early divers' trial-by-error efforts to master it. In one antediluvian contraption, men at the surface pumped air into the diver's suit, but when they or the compressor failed, ''if he was deep enough, the diver's body would be squeezed up into his helmet'' and reduced to ''a bloody blob of mush.''</p>
        <p>However, the bends, which Chowdhury himself has survived, may be the most terrifying of all, an excruciating and often crippling affliction that occurs when nitrogen absorbed into the blood under high pressure is forced into body tissues when that pressure is too quickly reduced. Or, in Chowdhury's memorable words, if divers ''did not decompress, their bodies would be like soda cans that are shaken, then opened in one brutal motion.'' This is what befell the two Rouses when they were forced to surface swiftly after running out of air. Chowdhury devotes much of ''The Last Dive'' to presenting a portrait of the two men, a likable enough duo, despite their reputation for bickering with each other. When Chrissy is evacuated to a decompression chamber (his father, Chris, died on the boat) and a medical team draws his blood, ''instead of normal blood, the syringe contained foam.''</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Chowdhury's vividness with grisly detail doesn't extend itself to character, or the conclusion of ''The Last Dive'' would be unbearable. His workmanlike prose gets the job done, and if the Rouses, despite his efforts to plumb their depths, don't emerge as fascinating -- they're too single-minded about winning status in their tiny world -- the pointless agony of their suffering, and the devotion they showed each other in extremis, do.</p>
