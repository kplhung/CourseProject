        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Having immigrated to New York from Poland as 23-year-olds in 1981, my wife and I were typical wide-eyed new arrivals. Everything here was bigger. People spoke an unfamiliar language, and there was this strange game called baseball. Little did we know that we were going to embrace baseball with fire once reserved for soccer.</p>
        <p>As we slowly settled into the fabric of American life, both attending graduate school in New York, we accompanied our fellow students to a few Mets games at Shea. It was 1984. We were initially attracted by the leisurely deliberate pace of the game, its family atmosphere, and the fact that people bring their youngsters and even newborns to the ballpark. Needless to say, it was a good time to become a Mets fan. The thrill of the 1986 season is still with us, and we like to think it was our rite of passage of sorts on the way to becoming Americans.</p>
        <p>My wife, now a vice president at a New York bank, astounds her co-workers by occasionally firing off, in her sweet European accent, the Mets' lineup from those years: Doc Gooden, Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter, Wally Backman, Lenny Dykstra, Ron Darling, Bobby Ojeda, Mookie Wilson, Jesse Orosco.</p>
        <p>The 1986 Mets became part of our new roots in America. The 2000 Mets gave us the thrill of a Subway Series. Is this a great country, or what?</p>
