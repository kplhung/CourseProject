        <p>ALICE IN BED'' is Susan Sontag's riff on Alice James, the brilliant, depressed sister of the novelist Henry James and the psychologist William James. Now in previews at New York Theater Workshop in the East Village, the play opens next Sunday. It is directed by Ivo van Hove, the resident director of the Het Zuidelijk Toneel, a prominent repertory company in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>In June, the company and New York Theater Workshop presented ''Alice in Bed'' at the Holland Festival, which Mr. van Hove also directs. In this production, the play's New York premiere, Joan MacIntosh portrays Alice and Jorre Vandenbussche the Young Man. Cast members who appear in the video segments include Elizabeth Marvel and Paul Rudd.</p>
        <p>Written in 1992, ''Alice in Bed'' is Ms. Sontag's only full-length published play. Yet in her fiction and nonfiction she has expressed an abiding interest in the theater, as witnessed by her recent novel, ''In America,'' about a great 19th-century Polish actress who makes an even greater career for herself on the American stage.</p>
        <p>Alice James, who was bedridden most of her adult life, died in 1892 at the age of 43. But far from depressing, ''Alice in Bed'' animates Alice James's teeming inner world, one that includes a version of the Mad Tea Party from ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Included on Ms. Sontag's guest list are the early feminist journalist Margaret Fuller and the poet Emily Dickinson.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month at the workshop, Ms. Sontag and Mr. van Hove talked with the stage director Richard Schechner, a professor of performance studies at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. Here are excerpts from their tape-recorded conversation:</p>
        <p>RICHARD SCHECHNER  Why Alice James? Why the 19th century?</p>
        <p>SUSAN SONTAG  I didn't write the play to conform to historical reality but to take certain elements in the life of this extraordinary woman and career invalid and run with them. The woman who is trapped doesn't have to be Alice James. It's an extra layer that she bears the name of a real person and that the audience can bring some knowledge to the story. But the play has to stand on its own, on what Ivo and Joan have done: Joan's power and poignancy, and the incredible stuff that Ivo has surrounded her with.</p>
        <p>IVO VAN HOVE  This woman, who is super intelligent, is very conscious of herself. She can see herself lying there and she says, ''Well, get up!'' But she can't get up. I don't want to use the word schizophrenic because that's not what I mean. But it's somebody who knows exactly what state she is in; she knows what's wrong with her. And she is sensitive to all that is happening.</p>
        <p>SONTAG  I'm constantly astonished by what people make of the play. Sometimes I am asked to explain it. Needless to say, I believe the text speaks for itself.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  You give the director a lot of freedom. When you were asked about how ''Alice in Bed'' was done in 1996 at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., you said, ''The play belongs to the director and the fact that I'm a living, not a dead author shouldn't change that.''</p>
        <p>SONTAG  I gladly gave the play to Ivo because there are few directors in the world I admire as much as I do him. I was curious to see what he would do. And the result is, indeed, very surprising to me.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  Ivo, you staged it by surrounding Alice with video clips, blowups of the face of her domineering father, voices, a wild montage of sights and sounds. But, Susan, when I read the text, you didn't call for multimedia. It wasn't ''necessary,'' to use your word.</p>
        <p>SONTAG  Not at all.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  So how did it come about?</p>
        <p>SONTAG  One of the things I see in Ivo's work is that each play stimulates him to invent a form and an approach that's very specific and different.</p>
        <p>VAN HOVE  From the moment I first read a play, I know if I am in love with it or not. Like in real life. I was immediately in love with this woman, this Alice, with how she feels about life or death, about surviving. I feel the heart of this person who wants to be in this room alone, who hates it and who loves it. It was my first idea that it should be totally centered on Alice, that the encounters with the others are in her mind. And so, for me, the whole play became like an opium dream. Alice has these dreams of her father, of her brother Henry, of all these women from 19th-century literature visiting her. And then there is the scene where she meets the Young Man.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  That's very different. The Young Man is real, a concrete physical presence on the stage.</p>
        <p>VAN HOVE  But in order to make that work, this scene should be the only one that happens onstage in real time. You must feel that for the first time in her life, Alice encounters somebody real -- she actually lives for a few minutes. In order for that to work, I had to make everything before into fantasies. Thus the multimedia -- to show the life in her head, her virtual world.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  That virtuality is implicit in the play itself. Even without the multimedia, the other figures are imaginary, even if they are played by live actors. Was that your intention?</p>
        <p>SONTAG  No. They are independent creatures.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  Including Margaret Fuller and Emily Dickinson?</p>
        <p>SONTAG  No, no. The tea party is a kind of free-form version of the Mad Tea Party from ''Alice in Wonderland.'' But the Nurse and Alice's brother are really there in what I wrote. I didn't think of the play as mostly a monologue, of it taking place in her head. But who knows? The greatest compliment you can pay a play is to give it different kinds of readings.</p>
        <p>One of the most interesting aspects of theater is the afterlife of plays. Think of all the different readings of each of Shakespeare's plays. None is the ''right one.'' Texts that survive are always being reinvented, reimagined. What Ivo sees is perfectly valid. But I have to say it's not what I saw. I saw real actors onstage.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  What generosity on your part to proclaim, ''This is not how I imagined it but I can see how this can be one way to do it.''</p>
        <p>SONTAG  Let's not talk about generosity. My ambition is to write a few plays that will be performed again and again.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  I know you admire Caryl Churchill----</p>
        <p>SONTAG  I revere Churchill.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  So does that explain why the tea party in your play is similar to the gathering of famous women in Churchill's ''Top Girls''?</p>
        <p>SONTAG  The truth is that I wasn't aware my tea party was something like that scene in ''Top Girls.''</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  Not aware?</p>
        <p>SONTAG  Not consciously aware. Surely I was inspired by ''Top Girls'' in depicting a group of women trying to console one another. But my ghosts in that scene are all from the 19th century -- an excellent time for examining issues of renunciation as they played themselves out in the lives of middle-class women. Obviously, we're talking about women who were very privileged. That's what separates Alice from the burglar at the play's end, who says: ''I ain't an animal, y'know. I'm a human being just like you.'' The class difference.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  What kind of research did you do?</p>
        <p>SONTAG  What some people call research, I call reading. Of course, I knew the story. But there was no quest for historical accuracy. I didn't want to know any more than I vaguely knew, that Alice was the kid sister in the James family, that she went to bed, that she died of breast cancer, that she asked her father for permission to commit suicide when she was 20.</p>
        <p>The play is a free fantasy based on some elementary givens of this life, braided with imagery from ''Alice in Wonderland'' -- the most famous Alice of the 19th century -- to evoke completely contemporary themes. It is not dependent on knowing anything historical, not even Lewis Carroll.</p>
        <p>My writing of the play started with something visual. I was visiting my Italian publisher in his villa on Capri. When I walked in, I saw a pile of thin mattresses that went most of the way up the wall in the patio entrance. I was, naturally, struck by this. And when I was shown into the living room, I asked the wife of my publisher about them. She said, ''Oh, my interior decorator thought it was interesting.'' And I suddenly had an image of a woman in bed under 10 thin mattresses. She's not actually being suffocated. They are an emblem of her semi-voluntary self-imprisonment. And then I thought, ''Who is that woman?'' And the answer in my head was, ''Oh, it's Alice James.'' The play was born from a very concrete image, which Ivo chose not to perpetuate, but which has been used in most productions: that you first see Alice under a stack of mattresses.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  There are no mattresses in this production, but Alice is mostly immobile, contained in a kind of plastic contraption----</p>
        <p>VAN HOVE  Cast from Joan's body. No other actress can lie in it. It's as if her bed becomes her body or her body is her bed.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  So why does she get out of it in that next to final scene with the Young Man?</p>
        <p>VAN HOVE  When I first read the play I was very uneasy with that scene. But thinking about it, rereading it, talking about it with the dramaturge, I realized that the scene was the center of the whole play. In this scene, Alice is offered the possibility for life, but she has no tools to take advantage of it. For me, the Young Man is raw life, a burglar who enters and acts.</p>
        <p>In reaction to him, Alice acts, she becomes seductive. She plunges into the middle of life, blood runs in her veins, she walks, she talks to a real person, she initiates the action. That's what makes the scene so astonishing. It was a hard scene to direct and to play. But in the end it becomes, I hope, a shock: for Alice, for the Young Man, for the audience. But when it's over, she goes back to bed. Finally, there is no real contact between Alice and the burglar.</p>
        <p>SONTAG  The burglar is a nice kid. He's sorry for Alice. He's genuinely moved by her and he's drawn to the possibility of having contact with someone who is from the moon, as far as he is concerned. But then the class realities, his awareness of her privilege (for all her despair) and the contrast with the life he comes from, make him go back. Her reactions are different. But there's some kind of reciprocity of attraction. It's not just that she sees life coming through the door and then it goes away.</p>
        <p>VAN HOVE  For me, it's an existentialist play, not a historical drama. The play asks the question, ''How should we live?'' No one can give an answer to someone else. You have to find the answer in yourself.</p>
        <p>SONTAG  Alice knows exactly what's going on. I am very attached to her monologue about Rome which, to me, is the heart of the play -- everything radiates from it. The boy with the injured thumb at the end of the Rome monologue is the avatar of the Young Man. It's real life, this street urchin with the runny nose and the injured hand. Alice asks, ''What do you do with a beggar?'' You can walk on, knowing you can't change a beggar's life by giving him money. Or you can give everything you have. Or you can give one warm coin. All three ways of acting seem wrong. Haven't we all had this experience, living in large cities and being panhandled? What do you do? It's a torment.</p>
        <p>Alice is constantly thinking about the question, the great question: How does one live? How ought one to live? How can one live better? And what I like about her is that although she is helpless and self-absorbed, she still remains open to these questions.</p>
        <p>VAN HOVE  Yes, but in the end, she stays in that bed, she cannot take this step into life.</p>
        <p>SONTAG  She lacks self-love. And this is more likely to be a woman's problem than a man's problem. But I don't think of Alice as immobile. She's so active mentally. And Joan's Alice is a bouillon cube of pathos, so concentrated and so anguishing.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  Her intensity reminded me of the work Joan and I did with the Performance Group in the 1960's and 70's, before we were divorced.</p>
        <p>SONTAG  She can move only for 10 minutes -- while the Young Man is onstage. But there's no sense of immobility as in Beckett's late plays. Quite the opposite. It's as if she's everywhere -- the stage is so alive.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  Her body may be immobilized, but not her mind----</p>
        <p>SONTAG  Which is dancing.</p>
        <p>SCHECHNER  Ivo, your stagings are so articulate. I was entirely taken with the X-ray vision -- the way you exposed the heart of the action -- of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' at New York Theater Workshop in 1999. I'm sorry I missed your version of O'Neill's ''More Stately Mansions'' there. Why don't you write your own plays?</p>
        <p>VAN HOVE  When I was younger I did. But then I discovered that my work is much more personal when I have the distance a text of a Susan Sontag, a William Shakespeare, a Eugene O'Neill, a Tennessee Williams can give me. I consider my theater as my diary. I do a play because it means something personal to me. When you look at my productions you see who I am. I hope I am a craftsman, but also more than that. My productions are masked autobiographies. I'm like a vampire, I take life from the texts I work with.</p>
        <p>SONTAG  That's lovely. Maybe I could adapt what Ivo just said to my relationship to the historical models of the characters in ''Alice in Bed.''</p>
        <p>I'm also like a vampire. In order to be myself, I need to find a distance from whatever autobiographical impulse I have. I need to start with a real story or real characters. And then they're radically transformed.</p>
