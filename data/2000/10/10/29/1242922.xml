        <p>FOR 17-year-old Rebecca Richman and her boyfriend, Travis, this spring was their first spring in love, and like many New York lovers, they often wandered deep into Central Park, feeling as if they were alone in the world. Day after day, they held hands, spread out a blanket near a pond, had picnics and took pictures of each other. But on June 21, their idyll ended. That is the day the National Collegiate Athletic Association allows recruiters to begin calling the basketball players they want to woo.</p>
        <p>The calls were not for her boyfriend, John Travis Trueluck, 20, who, in high school, was a star player in a local league in the Bronx. They were for Rebecca, a senior at Brooklyn Technical and one of the top female high school basketball players in the city.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Rebecca was courted by nearly 20 colleges, including the University of Virginia, the University of Maryland and Boston College. She chose Rutgers, where she plans to play center next year and study to be a teacher.</p>
        <p>''They were just so mature,'' she said of the girls on the team. ''No matter if they played basketball or not, they weren't just housewives. They were wonderful young women. I want to be like that. I see myself like them.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca, who is nearly 6 feet 5 inches tall, is part of the first generation of girls in New York who grew up with the Women's National Basketball Association, which played its first game in summer 1997. For these girls, the professional league is a tantalizing goal, part of a constellation of opportunities, including college scholarships, that reflect the growing interest in both basketball and women's sports. Female basketball players now have choices once open only to boys. But the increased opportunities have also complicated their lives, as they negotiate this new world.</p>
        <p>Though women's professional basketball is not as lucrative as the men's game, a lot of money is involved. Women in the league report hefty sponsorships, appearance fees and salaries averaging $55,000 for three months of play. More than 14,000 fans regularly stream into Madison Square Garden to watch New York Liberty stars like Teresa Weatherspoon, and thousands more tune in to the games on ESPN, NBC, Lifetime and Madison Square Garden's cable network.</p>
        <p>The W.N.B.A. has spurred the growth of more than 10 top-notch amateur girls' leagues in the city, giving players like Rebecca and the fleet-footed Renee Taylor, a promising 15-year-old from Harlem, an outlet for their talents and passion for the game. Big companies like Nike and Adidas have poured money into the local leagues, in which hundreds of girls play. Numerous neighborhood teams pop up every year, and each is a little world in which girls who run, girls who shoot, and girls who score -- all garnering respect by exercising their bodies as athletes -- are the heroes, not the trophies. Coaches from colleges nationwide  scout players from the stands.</p>
        <p>The leagues also offer enticing educational incentives. The coaches stress academics as well as sports, and the girls are well aware that the W.N.B.A., unlike the N.B.A., requires that its players finish four years of college before entering the draft.</p>
        <p>Both Rebecca and Renee play in the SlamJam Women's Basketball Classic, a league that began in 1994. SlamJam brings together top girls from public schools with players from the powerhouse Roman Catholic school teams for some of the toughest competition in the city. SlamJam runs five tournaments a year. In the fall tournament, whose championship game is today, 144 girls on 12 teams have played more than a dozen games.</p>
        <p>For the mainly working- and middle-class parents of the players, the ultimate aim is a scholarship to a good four-year college. Thanks to the rigorous focus of basketball practices and the caring adults involved, many girls can reach that goal.</p>
        <p>''We don't care if they use basketball to go to school for four years, as long as they get an education that's a positive influence,'' said Philip Corley, coach for the Riverside Church Lady Hawks, one of the strongest teams in SlamJam's fall tournament.</p>
        <p>But for many girls, stars flutter in their eyes as they watch the 176 players on 16 W.N.B.A. teams.</p>
        <p>''For girls, there's a big opportunity, something to do after college instead of just disappearing,'' Rebecca said. ''Every tall girl you see has got a basketball shirt on now. Before, you'd have to be a model or a cheerleader or something like that.''</p>
        <p>The growth of the league has also meant new trials, though, as girls like Rebecca make increasingly complex decisions about school and life. It is no accident that the favorite movie of many of the girls is the recent ''Love and Basketball,'' about a female basketball player. The new options for girls have also brought big changes for boys and young men like Travis. He has his own basketball dreams, but the program at a prep school he attended in Baltimore fell apart last spring, and he had to come home.  Travis now lives in Mott Haven in the Bronx and attends Westchester Community College. His professional future is on hiatus.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to come to most of her school games this year,'' Travis said, chuckling  slightly. ''It's just funny. I dated two girls who played basketball before, and I never did that before. They came to watch me play. I never did that. Me and Rebecca are just closer than I was with those other two.''</p>
        <p>'I'm Going to College And I Want to Learn'</p>
        <p>Rebecca was born in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, the youngest of four children born to Jamaican immigrants. Her parents split up when she was a baby, and she and her brother moved to the South Bronx, with her mother.</p>
        <p>By the time she was 12, Rebecca was already over 6 feet tall. The boys had long teased her about her height.</p>
        <p>''It was hard,'' said Rebecca, who carries her height gracefully now. ''People made fun of you, especially since I was taller than everybody else. In sixth grade I was really skinny and they called me skeleton. They called me giant. Playing ball got me over it. It's not bad to be tall anymore. Now I'm big, and nobody can stop me.''</p>
        <p>In junior high, another tall girl encouraged Rebecca to join the school basketball team with her. Rebecca also played for another South Bronx team, the Lady Bruins, under the tutelage of Thomas Yahn, a former professional football player with the New England Patriots.</p>
        <p>''When I first met Rebecca, she was very meek, shy and laid back, but she was hungry,'' Mr. Yahn said. ''She always wanted to go to the park to work on layups. But she was also a 90 student. I refer to her as the definition of the student-athlete.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca learned quickly, Mr. Yahn said. At Brooklyn Tech, she became an exceptional player, one of the most sought-after recruits in the city. She was recently ranked one of the best female high school players in the country by the publication Street &amp; Smith's. In high school, Rebecca joined the Franchise team in the Bronx, which competes in SlamJam.</p>
        <p>At first, the girls in SlamJam played in a tiny Harlem gym with a ceiling so low that highly arcing jump shots bounced back. There was one summer program, but it was tough to find enough good players. SlamJam's founder, Clyde Frazier Jr., a state tax investigator who is no relation to the New York Knick legend Walt Frazier, scraped together $2,800, mostly from city grants, to run the league then. Now the yearly budget is about $30,000, and the games are in the airy gym at Riverbank State Park</p>
        <p>At SlamJam's recent all-star game, girls drove down the court, stopped, set their shots and then arced in swish after swish from the top of the key. They ran fantastic transition plays, complex reversals and tight double screens, and dribbled in so many circles that their defenders almost fell down flat.</p>
        <p>Rebecca was dynamite. She grabbed 25 rebounds as if she were picking cherries off a tree, and sometimes a small guard dribbling fiercely toward the net would stop, bewildered, look up and see nothing but Rebecca, who then blocked her shot.</p>
        <p>The players know the statistics of the girls who were seen in SlamJam and then went on to National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments at places including the University of Connecticut to St. Peter's College in Jersey City to Harvard to Georgia Tech. But Rebecca never knew what the recruiting was like until she experienced it.</p>
        <p>She had a dozen messages, she said, when she got home the first night recruiters could call. Boxes of pleading letters cluttered her apartment, and confusion rang in her head.</p>
        <p>''It was crazy,'' she said. ''It was like having five boyfriends and deciding to marry only one.''</p>
        <p>She asked her coaches for advice, but they said she had to decide for herself. She asked Travis, and he said that when she knew what the right decision was, she'd ''feel it inside.''</p>
        <p>He was right. When she talked to C. Vivian  Stringer, the coach at Rutgers, ''she was just so real,'' Rebecca said. ''She told me I had a lot of potential that she could help me develop, but that it would take a lot of work. Everyone else was like, 'You're great.' But I'm going to college and I want to learn. She told me the truth. That was all I wanted, not sugarcoated.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca said she wanted to play in the pros, but she also thinks about being a teacher. More than anything, she said, she wanted to be happy, and would play as long as it made her happy.</p>
        <p>Rebecca's father lives in Rochester and cooks in a restaurant, she said. She sees him about once a year. They do not talk much.</p>
        <p>Rebecca said her mother was religious and did not approve of basketball. At first she was afraid that Rebecca would get hurt, the girl said. Her mother has never attended any of her games, but wants to, Rebecca said. She would not talk for publication.</p>
        <p>''I tell her that it is going to take me far in life,'' Rebecca said. ''I tell her it's going to bring a lot to me. Her too. One of the reasons I want to play is to get her out of the South Bronx. She finally started to understand when she found out we'd not have to pay for college. She always wanted me to go to a big-time college. Now it's free. She's happy about that.''</p>
        <p>'I Have a Body To Throw Around'</p>
        <p>Younger girls, like Renee Taylor, are even more fixated on life in the W.N.B.A. Renee is a starring guard for the powerful Riverside Church team, whose boys are known as some of the best in the country. In her eyes is the inspired gleam of a girl who barely remembers when there was not a W.N.B.A.</p>
        <p>Renee started to play seven years ago, when she was 8. Riverside had no girls team then, so she played with the boys. Her friends say she can break a guy's ankle on the court. (''I like to trip them sometimes,'' she admitted.) Her coaches say that once she is focused, she never misses a shot.</p>
        <p>Renee's voice is high and quiet. She speaks so softly that suddenly all the girls will be laughing and the coaches will not know who made the joke, and that is when they know it was Renee. Her shots are the same way. Look up, and they're in.</p>
        <p>Once, Renee wanted to be a surgeon because she imagined how incredible it would feel to peel back the layers of skin on a person and feel someone's heart in her hands. Now Renee is a basketball player, and she can often be found on the sidelines peeling back the layers of skin on the court with her eyes, trying to decipher how each player plays.</p>
        <p>Her days are long, starting at 5:55 a.m. with a bowl of Fruity Pebbles in the apartment she shares with her mother and baby brother, Terrell, in the Abraham Lincoln Houses on Madison Avenue at 135th Street.  She dreams about basketball on No. 6 and No. 2 trains and Q-44 buses as they whisk her through her day, from home to classes at Monsignor Scanlon High School in the Bronx to her practices.</p>
        <p>Renee, who is only 5 feet 2 inches, admits that if she could, she would jump straight from high school to the W.N.B.A. Still, she would like to go to Rutgers too. Her father almost played for the Utah Jazz, but personal problems kept him back. She will not let anything keep her back, she said.</p>
        <p>She ignores the girls in tight jeans who call her a tomboy. She thinks about boys, she said. But mostly she thinks about basketball, and conversations with her inevitably veer back to the intricacies of the game.</p>
        <p>''My game is more physical than most girls','' she said in her apartment's living room, her many trophies stacked about. ''I have a body to throw around. I get the foul and get the shot. Before you'd see me and say she's nice, and there'd be nothing to say after that. A lot of people want to see you go to the W.N.B.A. now.''</p>
        <p>Her mother, Sharese Taylor, is enthusiastic about Renee's possible basketball career.</p>
        <p>''I never really thought about girls playing basketball before her,'' she said. ''Now I'd like to see her make it into the W.N.B.A. But whatever she wants to do is fine.''</p>
        <p>'Love and Basketball,' On Screen and in Life</p>
        <p>In ''Love and Basketball,'' a girl and the boy who lives next door love basketball and each other. They are recruited by the same college, where they are both star players. He goes to the N.B.A. before finishing school, and is injured. She goes to the W.N.B.A., and the movie ends with him in the stands holding their baby and smiling at her.</p>
        <p>Rebecca and Renee love this film. Rebecca and her best friend, Tanika Price, sit for hours and talk over all the questions raised by the movie, which are also on their minds.</p>
        <p>''You know that movie 'Love and Basketball'?'' said Tanika, who goes by the name Biggie, for her height and attitude on the court. ''We always talk about that, how if you have kids when you grow up, how you're going to manage the kids. We all worry if we don't make it to the W.N.B.A. what we're going to be. You never see a 6-4 teacher.''</p>
        <p>The girls also talk about the financial details of pro contracts, especially maternity leave policy, and where boys will fit in.</p>
        <p>When Rebecca was being recruited, Travis would swing by her building, and the second he arrived a coach would call. She would poke her head out of the window and shout, ''Just a minute,'' and Travis would  wait. They knew it would not be just a minute. It would be a half hour, an hour. He got sick of it, but he would wait.</p>
        <p>''He knows the odds of everything,'' Rebecca said. ''We don't get into it. I don't want to say he's not going to make it. He'll be successful at anything he does. We're best friends, and we're always going to be best friends. He's my boyfriend, yeah, but he's my support system.''</p>
        <p>One recent evening, Travis waited in the stands during Rebecca's practice at a gym at East Tremont Avenue in the West Farms section of the Bronx. He carried a speckled-egg composition book in which he keeps the record of his life in the sport. He writes down inspirational quotations that catch his eye and carefully, symmetrically, pastes in photographs of games. There are many empty pages that he hopes to fill.</p>
        <p>But he is also working on a book for Rebecca. He plans to put in the photographs they have taken and write descriptions of her games. He will save newspaper clippings about her, he said, and paste them in. He will let her come up with quotations that are meaningful to her.</p>
        <p>''My coach jokes around and says things like, 'We're going to see her in the W.N.B.A., and you'll be holding the two kids, saying, ''There goes Mommy,'' ' '' he said. ''I'm like, 'All right, all right, no problem.' ''</p>
        <p>He still wants to go to the pros. But he can imagine other lives, maybe opening a barbershop.</p>
        <p>At the end of practice, Rebecca and Travis strolled slowly out of the gym, their fingertips touching. They walked out onto East Tremont Avenue, and that night, it might as well have been Central Park.</p>
        <p>They kept walking slowly past the men shouting on the street corners and the white lights streaming out from the bodegas and the elevated trains, until the night swallowed them up. But for a final brief moment, the lights shone on Rebecca's tall frame, and there she was, a basketball bag under one arm and Travis under the other.</p>
