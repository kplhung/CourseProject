        <p>Q: You're about to open in ''The Rocky Horror Show.'' This is your Broadway debut, isn't it?</p>
        <p>No, I replaced Tom Courtenay in ''Otherwise Engaged,'' by Simon Gray. Harold Pinter directed me for six days, and then he had to leave for England. My character had every other line from curtain rise to curtain fall. It was easier for me to learn that than it is this part because I don't have any dialogue. The narrator comes out and does a six-line, single-space speech and leaves.</p>

        <p>Q: You're about to open in ''The Rocky Horror Show.'' This is your Broadway debut, isn't it?</p>
        <p>No, I replaced Tom Courtenay in ''Otherwise Engaged,'' by Simon Gray. Harold Pinter directed me for six days, and then he had to leave for England. My character had every other line from curtain rise to curtain fall. It was easier for me to learn that than it is this part because I don't have any dialogue. The narrator comes out and does a six-line, single-space speech and leaves.</p>
        <p>What are the differences between being an interviewer and an interviewee and an actor?</p>
        <p>They all use different muscles. The best advice I ever got in helping me define it was from the great Jack Paar, my former boss, who said, ''You gonna do a show, don't make it an interview, kid. Make it a conversation.''</p>
        <p>How about being the interviewee -- is it different for you right now to be sitting where you are?</p>
        <p>No, it's good for me. It would be better if we were on television. It sounds so vain, and God, of course, will take me down for it, but I can always guarantee I'll be a good guest. I can't always guarantee I'll be a good host.</p>
        <p>Then what was it like to spend so many years where you had to subordinate yourself to draw other people out?</p>
        <p>Well, following Jack Paar's formula you don't necessarily subordinate yourself. You get to really talk about the things you want to talk about.</p>
        <p>There was a time when ''Did you see Cavett last night?'' was preamble to the conversation the intelligentsia had in which they discussed what was going on culturally. What's it like to no longer play that role?</p>
        <p>Well, if you let yourself dwell upon it, it's difficult. At the same time, I never thought anything I ever did, especially in television, would last more than three weeks. When one show was ending -- and they all seemed to be ending -- my secretary would say, ''Only 41 more shows to go,'' and I would say, ''Oh, God, get me through it -- what a relief it will be on that glorious day!'' and of course, it was lunatic in a way because, I mean, you'd just spent 90 minutes with Lucille Ball or Jimmy Stewart.</p>
        <p>Could you go back to it now?</p>
        <p>Yes, I could. I can live without it, but I'd rather do it.</p>
        <p>In ''Rocky Horror'' you're playing a character who is at a remove in a revival of what was already a kind of reified, ironic take on something. I'm reminded of that lyric from ''Follies'': ''First you're another sloe-eyed vamp,/Then someone's mother, /Then you're camp./Then you career from career to career.''</p>
        <p>Boy, whoever wrote those lyrics, you better get his name. He's good. I'm not sure you asked me a specific question. It's O.K., you shouldn't have to, it's a worn-out formula. I enjoy doing a variety of things. I wish that I had not left ''Otherwise Engaged'' when I did. The fun of doing a television show and going across town and doing a play, which I got for a couple of days, would have been wonderful.</p>
        <p>That's the adrenaline of multitasking, but I wonder what it will be like doing an extended run of the same thing without the other-brained feedback of speaking to folks in an unrehearsed manner.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure. My first time onstage, on Broadway, in ''Otherwise Engaged,'' I thought one night while someone else was talking: ''This is going to be over. We've only got about 10 minutes left. I don't want this to be over again.'' Judy Garland, you know, the famous star--</p>
        <p>I think I've heard of her.</p>
        <p>Judy Garland came on my daytime show. She was so heartbreaking and winning. And I came back to the theater later for some reason, and they said, ''You know, she just left.'' And I said, ''But we taped an hour and a half ago.'' And I didn't quite get it at the time, but I realize to leave that dressing table and the Kleenex and the room with the private toilet in it, and downstairs where you get laughs and applause . . . why would anybody in his right mind go back to real life?</p>
