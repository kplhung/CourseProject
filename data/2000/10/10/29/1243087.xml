        <p>Lisa W. Foderaro touched a nerve with her article, ''A County Consumed by Supermarket Envy,'' on Oct. 22. While I agree that the state of the supermarket industry in Westchester leaves much to be desired, correcting this situation should not be at the expense of the quality of life of citizens who are threatened with new supermarket development, literally in their front yards.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Lisa W. Foderaro touched a nerve with her article, ''A County Consumed by Supermarket Envy,'' on Oct. 22. While I agree that the state of the supermarket industry in Westchester leaves much to be desired, correcting this situation should not be at the expense of the quality of life of citizens who are threatened with new supermarket development, literally in their front yards.</p>
        <p>For many years, the Food Emporium in downtown Armonk has exhibited its disdain for the town's residents by providing poor and unfriendly service in dirty premises and at exorbitant prices. A.&amp; P., the parent of Food Emporium, now wants to build a new facility in the midst of two residential communities of some 200 homes on a small and winding country road. The impact on traffic congestion, the safety of children and the environmental concerns of air pollution, noise and garbage are not to be taken lightly.</p>
        <p>Armonk is a unique town that has managed, in spite of much pressure, to maintain its small-town feeling and friendly atmosphere. Bad development in Armonk, and elsewhere, does not have to be inevitable. It can and should be controlled for the benefit of its residents, not for others.</p>
