        <p>The final disorder of Alzheimer's was casting away the memories of his life's twin endeavors, farming and politicking. But John D. Stegemann could still delight his family by suddenly retrieving a vivid scrap of something seen and felt back in his heyday as a prairie liberal politician.</p>
        <p>''Harry Hopkins, now there's an Iowa Democrat,'' Mr. Stegemann unexpectedly announced one day to his daughter, bursting through his nursing-home anomie. She had been loyally reading aloud from a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt, she recalled the other day. The mention of Hopkins had sparked Mr. Stegemann to accurately observe what a creative fixer and factotum Roosevelt had in that man, just the stuff needed in any season of American politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stegemann was an enthusiastic grass-roots political leader first encountered during a back roads visit to the Iowa presidential caucus 20 years ago. An account of that visit appeared in The New York Times, and Mr. Stegemann has turned up in these pages every four years since then. News of his decline and demise last year presented one last opportunity to return and gauge his life in a level of provincial politics that was heartfelt to him, a basic level the public seldom sees.</p>
        <p>The family waited in vain for memories closer in time, such as the years when Mr. Stegemann bolted from hearth and plow to single-handedly rebuild the Sioux County Democratic Party on behalf of the Kennedy candidacies. Or his cherished trip from the farm to be a George McGovern presidential delegate proudly out of step with the Nixonian ''silent majority'' 28 years ago.</p>
        <p>And then last year, Esther D'Agrosa, Mr. Stegemann's daughter, laid her father to rest after 95 years of life.</p>
        <p>Across the last two decades, a reporter's quadrennial visit to Farmer Stegemann's political precinct proved invaluable as a relief from the hackneyed hubbub and weary marketing of the candidates' caravans. Mr. Stegemann was a tonic for the mounting American cynicism, so endlessly polled, toward the political process itself.</p>
        <p>With the same fervor devoted to tilling the land, Mr. Stegemann built a prairie machine that was an anomaly in the quilt-like weave of Republican primacy and tidy farm homesteads here in the northwest corner of Iowa.</p>
        <p>''He built it, started Democratic picnics here, got outside candidates to visit and even talked friends into running for county offices that never had Democratic challengers before,'' his daughter remembered.</p>
        <p>As the nation turns into the homestretch of the 2000 presidential race, Mrs. D'Agrosa, her husband, Gary, and their daughter Anna are debating this election as endlessly as ever. They have fed on each of the presidential debates and tracked the nonstop analysis. But the unabashed fervor of the patriarch is missing.</p>
        <p>''Democrat is still spoken here on the farm,'' he would firmly advise anyone inviting him to consider the ennui and self-congratulation of the nonvoting majority that has settled into fashion in modern politics as an annex of American entertainment, an occasion for nightly belly laughs.</p>
        <p>In conversation, Farmer Stegemann denied that politicians were any more flawed than their constituents. He said he was conscience-driven by family ancestors to shake off indifference and search out a politician worth supporting.</p>
        <p>Politics, he insisted, was a tradition rooted across time in the real issues and personalities of history, not some impulsive crankiness fed by sound bites.</p>
        <p>During one visit, he revealed his overriding compulsion to keep faith with his grandfather, Claus Heinrich Winter, a true sod-busting pioneer who was stopped a century ago by a neighbor wondering what caused him to rush off the farm in the middle of a work day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stegemann, beaming 20 years ago at the power of memory's reach, quoted from an old family diary entry about his grandfather's shouted reply, a paraphrasing of Ecclesiastes: ''There is a time to be born and a time to work, a time to die, and there is a time to go and hear William Jennings Bryan speak!''</p>
        <p>The record shows Farmer Winter snapped the reins and, at a prairie crossroads, joined the crowd for a spell-binding performance of the ''cross-of-gold'' speech by Bryan, the populist Free Silver Democrat. ''Muzzle not the ox that treadeth out the corn,'' Bryan declared in a caution that managed to resonate down through the modern politicking of Mr. Stegemann.</p>
        <p>But in this election, Mr. Stegemann has been muzzled by time. He rests down at the Lutheran cemetery. His county machine is as fallow as the autumnal prairie land that glows burnished and waiting. Once again, there are no Democratic candidates to be scared up for the Sioux County slate.</p>
        <p>''Daddy would not have liked this year's choice at all,'' said Mrs. D'Agrosa, who finds both presidential candidates far too calculating and unrevealing, with no sign, she lamented, of being driven by the sort of deep principle that excited her father. ''I'm going to vote, but it's not a joyous vote,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In such a tradition laden family, Mrs. D'Agrosa worries that she is not the political force of nature her father was and that it all may be ending. But she finds promise in her 23-year-old daughter, Anna.</p>
        <p>In the relentless prescription of Ecclesiastes, Anna found there was a time a few years ago to leave the farm, a time to study theater in New York City.</p>
        <p>''Anna never missed an election, always voting by absentee ballot here, even for the school board,'' the mother noted. ''But this year she called and said she was registering to vote in New York. She said Hillary needs her vote.</p>
        <p>''It's a great legacy she's got,'' said the mother, awaiting Election Day. ''You never sit and teach these things.''</p>
