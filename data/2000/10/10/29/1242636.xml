        <p>Did you believe that your message was subtle? Yes, you documented that Al Gore has kissed his wife in public on another occasion. It's not surprising what the photo archives will uncover. It's even less surprising that Bill Clinton took full advantage of this opportunity to skewer the Republican Party, to assert his ''close personal'' relationship with a foreign leader and to tout his economic agenda. Samuel Berger fell into line, too, by suggesting that the Gores will warm our nation with their devotion. For years the news media have informed us that Bill Clinton's marital infidelity (in the office, with an employee, while on the job) was unrelated to his performance as our president. Now you want us to believe that Al Gore's loving marriage (which I admire) will be an asset to his performance as president. You can't have it both ways.</p>
