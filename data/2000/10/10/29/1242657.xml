        <p>THE countertenor David Daniels hates the term ''falsetto.'' He understands that there is no other term to describe his technique. The dictionary definition of ''countertenor'' is a high male falsetto voice, meaning that it is achieved through an artificial method of voice production involving only partial vibration of the vocal chords. But the nomenclature drives him crazy: ''falsetto'' (from the Latin word for ''false''), ''artificial.''</p>
        <p>''Speaking for myself, I don't think that my voice production is a perfect and dictionary example of what a falsetto voice is,'' Mr. Daniels said recently in New York. ''It's more complicated than that.''</p>

        <p>THE countertenor David Daniels hates the term ''falsetto.'' He understands that there is no other term to describe his technique. The dictionary definition of ''countertenor'' is a high male falsetto voice, meaning that it is achieved through an artificial method of voice production involving only partial vibration of the vocal chords. But the nomenclature drives him crazy: ''falsetto'' (from the Latin word for ''false''), ''artificial.''</p>
        <p>''Speaking for myself, I don't think that my voice production is a perfect and dictionary example of what a falsetto voice is,'' Mr. Daniels said recently in New York. ''It's more complicated than that.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Daniels, the way he sings feels perfectly natural, though it took years of unnecessary anguish to come to this realization. A son of two voice teachers from Spartanburg, S.C., Mr. Daniels studied voice at the University of Michigan. He was a frustrated tenor, and miserable. Despite his hard work and drive, high notes eluded him, and his singing just seemed to get worse.</p>
        <p>He told a psychotherapist he was seeing at the time about his ''other voice,'' the high alto he unveiled at parties, for laughs, after a couple of beers. But he lacked the courage to take his other voice seriously. His therapist emboldened him to try.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels will never forget the date: March 2, 1992. From that day forward he became a countertenor. And over the years, he has won increasing acclaim. On Tuesday evening he sings the title role in a new production of Handel's ''Rinaldo'' at the New York City Opera, and it is one of the most anticipated events of the season.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels's sound is clear, warm, vibrant and full; his phrasing is supple and winsome; his musicianship is first-rate. To understand his remarkable expressive range, listen to the melting performance he gives of Rinaldo's 10-minute lament, ''Cara sposa,'' on the new Decca recording of ''Rinaldo,'' with Cecilia Bartoli as his beloved Almirena. He shapes the aching pianissimo melodic lines with affecting elegance. Then skip to the end of Act III to hear Mr. Daniels dispatch bolts of brilliant coloratura passage work with almost frightening ease in the triumphant ''Or la tromba.'' His artistry makes audiences forget about voice types and categories. This is simply great singing.</p>
        <p>Still, there is that intriguing ambiguity to his voice. Onstage, the sturdily built Mr. Daniels, 34, exudes a square-shouldered masculine confidence. His agility as an actor comes in part from his passion for basketball. When in New York during decent weather, he can often be found in the park, elbowing fellow players in a pickup game. Yet when he starts to sing, his alto voice has a tender beauty that seems classically feminine.</p>
        <p>Opera has always cultivated gender-blurring vocal and dramatic ambiguities, from the earliest times, when males in women's clothing sang comic character parts, to the days when mezzo-sopranos were asked to portray hormonal pages and adolescent counts, a practice that still continues, and to recent years, when another star countertenor, Brian Asawa, portrayed Baba the Turk, the bearded lady in Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress,'' as a male in drag. Gender ambiguity was embodied in the renowned singer who created the role of Rinaldo at its 1711 London premiere: Nicolo Grimaldi, called Nicolino.</p>
        <p>This Naples-born superstar, heralded in the courts of Europe, may have been more responsible than any other person for popularizing Italian opera in London in the early 18th century. There he became a favorite of Queen Anne. He had artistry, genius colleagues, wealth, fame: everything a man could want. Well, almost everything.</p>
        <p>Nicolino was a castrato. And though the origins of the practice of castration are murky, we know that by the early 17th century, boys were being mutilated for the specific purpose of steering them into opera. With their high voices unchanged, but supported by an adult male apparatus of lungs and rib cage, these extraordinary singers became pivotal to the international success of Italian opera over the next 200 years.</p>
        <p>Although some castratos were hulking figures and ridiculous actors, Nicolino was tall and majestic. He must have been something as Rinaldo, a heroic Christian knight during the First Crusade. But out of his throat came a clarion alto sound, huge, unearthly and alluring. To read the accounts, castrato voices were sensationally exciting.</p>
        <p>When the practice was finally shamed into extinction, the Baroque repertory disappeared into the libraries, though there were other reasons for this as well. With the Handel revival going strong in the mid-20th century, roles like Rinaldo were taken by a new roster of heroic mezzo-sopranos, the most renowned of our time being Marilyn Horne. Ms. Horne did a lot of gender-bending in her day, and spent countless hours onstage in leather armor and metal helmets, portraying heroes and warriors in Handel and Rossini operas. Her portrayals were also sensational though rather implausible.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Daniels sings her roles, it's a different matter. Here is a young, virile male portraying a crusading Christian knight in abject love, or the conniving Roman emperor in Handel's ''Giulio Cesare.''</p>
        <p>YET the gender-blurring ambiguity of the voice remains. And Mr. Daniels knows that in his case it is given extra resonance by the fact that he is an openly gay male, who readily admits to keeping his beard short and scruffy not out of macho display but because it gives him ''some semblance of a jaw line'' and because his ''other half'' likes it. He means his partner of 14 years, John Touchton, the music director at Christ Congregation Church in Silver Spring, Md., where he and Mr. Daniels live.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that an androgynous quality is built into a countertenor voice, Mr. Daniels said he doesn't think about it. Reality in the theater, especially in the opera house, is never literal, he said, and he's right. When Renata Tebaldi portrayed Puccini's Mimi, she looked like a well-fed, middle-aged Italian lady. But her sublime singing convinced you she was a consumptive, coquettish and vulnerable young Parisian woman in a tizzy of love.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels has thought more consciously about blurring gender roles and identities in some of the songs he sings. Being a countertenor and gay affects both his interpretations and, he assumes, the way audiences experience them. The best example is Vaughan Williams's ''Hands, Eyes and Heart,'' which Mr. Daniels performs on ''Serenade,'' his new song recital album from Virgin Classics, with the pianist Martin Katz. The song is a setting of a poem by Ursula Wood that conveys a woman's sensually charged thoughts about her male lover. It begins, ''Hands, give him all the measure/ of my love surer than any word.''</p>
        <p>''It definitely puts a different twist on the song with me singing it rather than a heterosexual male,'' he said. ''When I do songs like that, I never change the gender of pronouns. Would a heterosexual male sing it? Change 'his' to 'her?' ''</p>
        <p>Some have. For one, the baritone Thomas Hampson has faithfully performed songs by Mahler on texts written from the perspective of a woman, as well as song settings of poems by Whitman and others that are homoerotic.</p>
        <p>Actually, most of the repertory Mr. Daniels sings is textually appropriate for a man, he said. ''I have not crossed that line so often.''</p>
        <p>Female singers have been crossing it for centuries. They have had to, since most of the songs in the repertory were written by and for men. It's worth noting that one prominent male singer today who has been crossing that line as well, the baritone Sanford Sylvan, is also openly gay. Mr. Sylvan has made a prize-winning recording of Copland's ''Poems of Emily Dickinson'' for Nonesuch, and though the texts contain few explicit gender references, the sentiments are clearly those of a woman.</p>
        <p>Right now, Mr. Daniels is not thinking much about gender-blurring or other nuances of perception. He is immersed in rehearsals for ''Rinaldo,'' which he said is hellish to sing. With eight arias and two duets, ''the role makes Handel's Giulio Cesare look like a stroll through the park,'' he said. ''It is higher than Cesare.'' Though astonishing, ''Rinaldo,'' the first Italian opera Handel wrote for the London stage, has dramatic flaws, Mr. Daniels said. ''The third act doesn't quite hold together. A lot has to be done with the production.''</p>
        <p>THAT'S putting it mildly. In Act I, while Rinaldo and Almirena exchange little endearments in a beautiful garden, serenaded by singing birds, Armida, the queen of Damascus, who is also a sorceress, descends from on high in a cloud full of fire-spewing monsters and abducts the young woman. The opera ends with a bloody battle between the Christian crusaders and the Saracens. At the City Opera, the production is directed by Francisco Negrin and conducted by Harry Bicket. The cast includes two excellent sopranos: Christine Goerke as Armida and Lisa Saffer as Almirena.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels is excited to have played a notable role in the revival of Handel opera. ''We know that Handel was a dramatic genius,'' he said. ''He knew timing like nobody, knew how to drive to the next emotion. The second acts of his operas are always brilliant: one huge momentum-building aria after another. The mistake in the past has been trying to create grand opera out of these intimate Baroque works.'' He points to the Stephen Wadsworth production of ''Xerxes,'' which was presented at the City Opera in 1997, as a model of how to balance the dramatic sweep and Baroque refinement in Handel's stage works. ''We did that production all over this country,'' he said. ''And it sold out everywhere. Even the performances I wasn't in.''</p>
        <p>For all his love of Baroque opera and 19th-century art songs, Mr. Daniels would like to perform more music by living composers. He hasn't done much yet, he concedes, but is doing something about that. The composer Theodore Morrison, of the University of Michigan faculty, has written a set of five songs for Mr. Daniels, and Jack Beeson has composed a work for voice and chamber ensemble based on the story of the man on the flying trapeze.</p>
        <p>''I would love nothing more than to have an opera written around me,'' he said, ''something really interesting, a character from the past or even today. That would be an amazing experience. But it takes a whole company to commission an opera.''</p>
        <p>There should be a company somewhere willing to commission a new opera for Mr. Daniels to star in. Handel wrote ''Rinaldo'' for Nicolino, and Mr. Daniels's voice is comparably acclaimed. And ambiguous.</p>
