        <p>IN 1992, Larry Saez, a Secret Service agent since 1980, was assigned to the protective detail for Bill Clinton, presidential candidate. Several years later, he was assigned to the White House.</p>
        <p>But guarding the president is an intense task, with long hours and frequent holiday and weekend work. So Mr. Saez was delighted when he was named resident agent in charge of the White Plains bureau. From the start, he enjoyed the shift in emphasis from protective to investigative duties. He was also thrilled with the more regular hours.</p>
        <p>Then he got the phone call that the first family was moving to Chappaqua.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saez' laughter at this twist of fate fills his White Plains office.</p>
        <p>Although the Secret Service remains highly guarded about its operations -- particularly its protective measures for the president and his family -- Mr. Saez spoke willingly about the focus of his office, both before and after the Clintons' arrival in Chappaqua.</p>
        <p>Beforehand, Mr. Saez estimated that 90 percent of the work of his bureau -- which has jurisdiction over Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, Orange and Sullivan Counties -- was investigative, with only 10 percent protective. This latter portion was also highly seasonal.</p>
        <p>''When the United Nations General Assembly met in September or October,'' he said, ''we were very busy.'' That's because the Secret Service protects visiting heads of state and their spouses (''foreign digs,'' in the the shorthand of Mr. Saez). Because of its proximity to New York and its choice housing stock, many consulates have houses in Westchester.</p>
        <p>While their busy season was during the General Assembly, the bulk of the Secret Service's time in the pre-Clinton White Plains office was spent investigating bank and credit card fraud, as well as telecommunications and computer crime.</p>
        <p>The Clintons' arrival essentially turned the bureau's business mix on its head. Mr. Saez estimates that what his office does is ''now 80 percent protective and 20 percent investigative.''</p>
        <p>Though he would not go into detail about the Clintons' protective detail, he stressed how the Secret Service is especially concerned with securing entrance and exit paths because that is where many assassinations have occurred in the past. And if a safety or health emergency occurs, having an unobstructed path out serves to keep the public safe too.</p>
        <p>''If we speed away, there can be wet spots on the road or other hazards,'' causing the potential of a swerving vehicle.</p>
        <p>Not following the command of a Secret Service agent is considered a felony, but Mr. Saez said that usually, when a person refuses a request to move out of the way, ''cooler heads prevail.''</p>
        <p>He said that such a situation is assessed on the spot.</p>
        <p>''Is the person just being stubborn? Do they pose a threat? Do they have all their mental faculties? We try to work with people because our goal is not to arrest somebody for disobeying a simple request. Our goal is to get our protectees in and out safely, without incident. If everyone leaves with a good taste, then that makes our job easier to come back a second time.''</p>
        <p>Before the Clintons even moved in, the Secret Service began to cultivate relationships with the first family's new neighbors by holding a meeting with those who lived on the Clintons' cul-de-sac.</p>
        <p>''We explained to them,'' Mr. Saez recalled, ''not in great detail, but in some detail, that we would be present and that life as they know it would still be normal. It would just be slightly different.''</p>
        <p>The Secret Service also set to work building a relationship with local authorities. Robert Breen, the police chief for the Town of New Castle, which includes the hamlet of Chappaqua, cannot say enough about how easy the agents have been to work with.</p>
        <p>''They are gentlemen -- true professionals,'' Chief Breen said. ''I am very impressed.'' His force does traffic detail for the Secret Service and also ''sets up perimeters.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Mr. Saez, dressed in a steel gray suit with a hint of shine, met with Chappaqua residents at a forum at the town library and all but swept the crowd off its feet with his commanding presence lightened by his ability to tell a knee-slapper.</p>
        <p>The meeting started with Mr. Saez playing the tape of a television program done by Joan Lunden about the Secret Service's training center. Left on the tape, though, was a teaser for Ms. Lunden's next segment, in which she went undercover as a Las Vegas showgirl.</p>
        <p>As the image of Ms. Lunden, dressed as a red-feathered showgirl and in line with several other identically dressed showgirls flashed on the screen, Mr. Saez pointed to the showgirl next to Ms. Lunden and called out, ''That's me! We're everywhere.''</p>
        <p>The crowd roared.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Saez spoke, the floor was opened to questions and nearly every one concerned people's general interest in the Secret Service (''What is it like to guard Chelsea on a college campus?''), not disruptions caused by the Clintons' arrival. One man thanked Mr. Saez because one of his agents had taken the time to talk to his child, who had expressed interest in the Secret Service.</p>
        <p>In the end, after 20 years in the world of security at such a high level, does Mr. Saez ever find himself bringing his work home with him?</p>
        <p>''I don't think I do,'' he said, before leaning back in his chair, and then tacking on: ''I might.''</p>
        <p>Some people, he explained, can ride down the highway for miles and have no idea that a trooper is behind them. He can't.</p>
        <p>''I tend to use my mirrors a lot,'' he said with a wry smile. ''You are a product of your environment and sometimes you can't divorce yourself from things. I'm sure there are some mannerisms and behaviors that I have that are required for the job that I still have when I am off duty.''</p>
        <p>Above all else, he said, he carries with him a finely tuned instinct for people and their intentions.</p>
        <p>And after all these years, he also carries with him a wish: that people see Secret Service agents for the hard working people they are.</p>
        <p>''The last thing we want to do is have people believe that we're ogres,'' he said.</p>
