        <p>''It's just like I'm dead,'' says a former heroin addict who has been living at the paradoxically named Sunshine Hotel on the Bowery for eight years. ''Every day is the same.'' His is one of the 50 haunting voices and faces in four Bowery dives found in FLOPHOUSE: Life on the Bowery (Random House, $24.95), written by David Isay and Stacy Abramson, two radio producers, with photographs by Harvey Wang. Skid Row emerged at the end of the Civil War, which created homelessness on a vast scale. The area's 16 blocks held 25,000 to 75,000 men at its height, at the end of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th; the population today teeters around 1,000. The photographs are poignant black-and-white shots, wholly unsentimental. ''Got a short life left,'' says Mike Slokevace, who lives at the Andrews Hotel, which has the cheapest rooms -- cubicles really -- at $4.50 a night. ''As far as convenience goes, this is all I need -- a nice little bed, a place to sleep.'' The men have landed here in the expected ways: alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling, mental illness and plain old bad luck. Ted Edwards sums up his life as ''a failure within a failure within a failure.'' Oddly, despite what all the men have told them, the authors insist on their own romantic view of the Bowery bum and his habitat, calling the flophouses ''fascinating places, inhabited by the last residents of a world soon to vanish.''</p>
