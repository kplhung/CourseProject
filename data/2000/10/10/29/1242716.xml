        <p>STRONGER conservation programs, aggressive use of alternative energy sources and public control of the electricity supply were among the ideas proposed last week at a forum here on rising energy prices.</p>
        <p>The forum was sponsored by County Executive Andrew J. Spano, and many who attended acknowledged that most factors affecting energy prices are out of local control, like unrest in the Middle East, weather and federal energy policies. The discussion instead focused on what could be done on the local level.</p>
        <p>''We have to free ourselves from the inability of the federal government and the state to move things along,'' Mr. Spano said.</p>
        <p>State Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci, a Democrat, proposed that the county's Public Utility Service Agency, which already buys power in bulk for county facilities, do the same for residential customers. This would mean ''divorcing from Con Ed'' to help fight what he characterized as the company's price inflation.</p>
        <p>''It has to do with a corporate structure that has as its premise make money at the expense of the rate payer,'' he said of Con Ed. He said that the Public Utility Service Agency would do everything possible to help give consumers economic advantages, and proposed a referendum to empower the agency.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing that Con Edison does that we couldn't do ourselves,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tocci and others also complained that Westchester citizens were forced to bear the burden of the company's costs in New York City.</p>
        <p>A Con Edison spokesman, James O'Toole, responded that it was the market, not the company, that set the prices for energy, and that Con Ed was doing everything possible to keep rates down.</p>
        <p>''We always look for the best energy deals in the marketplace for our customers, but, despite our best efforts, prices have increased,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Edward Smeloff, Director of the Pace Energy Project and commissioner of the county's Public Utility Agency, proposed improved control and monitoring of consumers' energy use via technology like programmable thermostats and the internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano suggested that monitoring could eventually be made possible by linking electric, oil and gas meters to the county's developing high-speed network, Westchester Telecom, to give consumers immediate information on energy consumption. Such technology, Mr. Smeloff said, could increase energy efficiency. While the meeting was meant to draw the opinions of experts, many residents expressed their concerns.</p>
        <p>''Seniors especially are caught up like yo-yo's on a string,'' said Helen  Henderson, a former outreach worker from Mount Vernon who worked primarily with the elderly. She said she had helped people who were forced to choose between keeping their heat on or having enough medicine and food, and she called on local authorities to closely scrutinize and regulate energy costs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano asked most residents who testified to speak with representatives on hand to work out short-term help for their problems.</p>
        <p>''What we're trying to do is free ourselves from being hostage to federal policies by creating a whole bunch of solutions that cumulatively would have a big effect,'' Mr. Spano said. ''I think we got some excellent feedback, and we can now see more clearly that there are things that can be done.''</p>
