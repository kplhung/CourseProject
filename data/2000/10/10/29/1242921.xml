        <p>Ben Haber was hot. You could tell because his face turned red as he criticized the plan that he was hearing to bring the 2012 Summer Olympic Games to New York. And you could certainly tell when he said, ''You're going to have to walk over a lot of dead bodies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haber was not the only Queens resident alarmed by the proposals, which were presented to about 40 members of the Queens Civic Congress Monday night at the Union Plaza Nursing Home in Linden Hill.

        <p>Ben Haber was hot. You could tell because his face turned red as he criticized the plan that he was hearing to bring the 2012 Summer Olympic Games to New York. And you could certainly tell when he said, ''You're going to have to walk over a lot of dead bodies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haber was not the only Queens resident alarmed by the proposals, which were presented to about 40 members of the Queens Civic Congress Monday night at the Union Plaza Nursing Home in Linden Hill. The plan would bring to Queens five new athletic facilities and an Olympic Village housing 15,000 athletes and coaches.</p>
        <p>The borough president, Claire Shulman, has objected to siting the Olympic Village on Hunters Point between Newtown Creek and 45th Road, saying the plan would delay for years the completion of the Queens West residential project at that spot.</p>
        <p>Paul Graziano, a member of the Waldheim Neighborhood Association, criticized the plan to deepen Willow and Meadow Lakes in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and turn them into a rowing and canoeing course. ''The communities around the park will go absolutely bananas about your proposal,'' he said, meaning bananas in a bad way. The alterations, he said, would make the park a construction site for years and radically change the shape of the lakes.</p>
        <p>Daniel L. Doctoroff, the president of NYC 2012, a nonprofit group that is putting together the city's bid, said the Olympic Village would be built by a private developer so as to fit in with the design of Queens West, which would be a 73-acre development in Hunters Point across the East River from the United Nations. Mr. Doctoroff would not say how many acres the village would occupy, but said its 4,400 units would be sold or rented after the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doctoroff said television rights, ticket sales and licensing should raise $3.2 billion, of which $1.9 billion would be used to run the Games and $1.3 to build venues. He said the construction would ''create a legacy of parks and facilities that can be left to the community,'' especially in Queens, which would have more Olympic sites than any other borough.</p>
        <p>In response to the opposition expressed at the meeting, Mr. Doctoroff said, ''If you didn't create a little controversy, you couldn't create anything significant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Doctoroff said that NYC 2012 would be filing a 600-page Olympics bid with the United States Olympic Committee in December. Should the committee choose the city over seven competitors, New York would then go up against foreign cities, with the 2012 host city to be chosen in fall 2005.</p>
