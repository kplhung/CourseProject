        <p>Jeff Shireman, editor of The Indiana Daily Student, circulation 17,000, found himself the center of attention in his journalism classes after he published a fellow student's report about Goldman Sachs -- after Goldman paid for the writer's trip to its New York offices.</p>
        <p>Goldman arranged the visit just before its own recruiting visit to Indiana University.</p>
