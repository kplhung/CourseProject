        <p>WHEN Mexico's antitrust agency decided to break up the nation's airline monopoly in early October, the move was seen as a bold show of aggressiveness. It also sent a strong signal that with the government about to change hands, Mexico might be prepared to guarantee competitors greater access to markets now dominated by single companies.</p>
        <p>Telefonos de Mexico, known as Telmex, dominates telecommunications, Cintra owns the skies, the state-run Petroleos de Mexico, known as Pemex, controls oil and Bimbo rules the bread market. These companies have benefited greatly from decades of weak or nonexistent regulation, coupled with a tight relationship between big business and big government.</p>
        <p>Vicente Fox Quesada, who takes office in a little more than a month, has said that to accomplish his economic goals, he will need to strengthen existing antitrust and regulatory commissions. He wants to ensure that they are more powerful than the beasts they were devised to tame, giving competitors greater access to markets previously closed to them.</p>
        <p>The most important is the Federal Antitrust Commission, headed by Francisco Sanchez Ugarte. In its seven years of existence, it has tackled some of the nation's most powerful companies. Two years ago, it ruled that Telmex, run by one of Latin America's richest men, Carlos Slim, was a monopoly, a decision that should have resulted in major reductions on the leviathan's grip on the telecommunications market. Telmex's share of the long-distance market has rebounded to 81 percent after falling to about 70 percent, and the company still provides more than 95 percent of local service.</p>
        <p>But through appeals, Telmex has tied up the issue in the judicial system, raised the prospect of a telecommunications trade battle with the United States and illustrated the weakness of antitrust enforcement.</p>
        <p>All of this begs a question: What good is it to have an antitrust agency if its ability to enforce decisions depends on the good will of the companies it is regulating?</p>
        <p>''We need to give regulators the teeth that they don't have currently,'' said Emilio Goicoechea, a congressman from Mr. Fox's National Action Party. ''The regulators simply can't enforce their decisions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's economic advisers plan to present a proposal to Congress that would eliminate the ''judicial uncertainty'' of antitrust decisions. The law would limit the appeals process and allow the agency to put  regulations into effect immediately, even if they are challenged in court.</p>
        <p>Damian Fraser, a Latin American equity strategist for UBS Warburg, agreed with proposals to beef up regulatory agencies as a way to lower costs and increase efficiency.</p>
        <p>''The government's role should be to allow competition in the market,'' he said. ''I think it's a lot easier to take on monopolies in the new Mexico than in the past. What you had was a cozy, de facto, unwritten agreement between large companies and the PRI,'' the longtime ruling party.</p>
        <p>''The companies would support the PRI, if the PRI in turn would support the companies and help them maintain a dominant market share,'' he added.</p>
        <p>BUT even before Mr. Fox's plans are debated in Congress, the antitrust agency has begun acting more forcefully. A few weeks ago, it ruled against Cintra, calling for it to sell its two largest carriers, Mexicana and Aeromexico, as separate and competing entities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's economic team withheld comment on the recent Cintra deal, but said it was committed to a strong regulatory agency.</p>
        <p>The opposing argument is that Mexican companies need monopolistic power to compete with overseas rivals, especially under the North American Free Trade Agreement. In the wake of the Cintra decision, union leaders have led protests against what they see as any action that would ''jeopardize the future of this country's aviation,'' said Jaime Luis Gonzalez, general director of the Airline Pilots Association of Mexico.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gonzalez has threatened strikes and shutdowns if the airlines are split. He would view a breakup as an open invitation for foreign competitors to muscle into Mexico's air travel market, which could lead to layoffs of airline employees.</p>
        <p>Cintra officials also balked at the decision, arguing that a unified airline industry could better compete globally. They boast that after taking over the near-bankrupt airlines in 1995, Cintra grew to become Latin America's largest and most lucrative airline company. If it is split, they say, the separate airlines could not hold their own against United States carriers like United or Delta.</p>
        <p>The unfriendly reception, however, has not slowed the antitrust commission. It ruled recently that Pemex's gas stations would have to sell lubricants made by competitors of Lubmex, in which Pemex has 49 percent ownership.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Sanchez announced that the commission was investigating the selling practices of Coca-Cola in Mexico. Next in line, he said, are the selling practices of two dominant beer manufacturers, Grupo Modelo and Grupo Moctezuma Cuauhtemoc.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Fox succeeds in creating regulatory agencies capable of enforcing their rulings, the United States government would welcome the news. Richard W. Fisher, the deputy United States trade representative, recently came to Mexico to argue that its government had not done enough to prevent Telmex from denying competitors entry into Mexico's telecommunications market. AT&amp;T and WorldCom have complained about the interconnection fees that Telmex charges competitors to connect into its network, arguing that the practice violates World Trade Organization agreements.</p>
        <p>Although Mexico's federal regulators ordered Telmex this month to slash its interconnection rates by 63 percent, it remains to be seen if the order will be enforced. Telmex could seek another injunction. ''We will be looking to see whether or not these decisions by very earnest regulators will be implemented and enforced,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''I think the signal this will send is critical to the success of the Fox administration.''</p>
