        <p>Katy Grannan's photographs precisely captured the pain of a failed marriage. And Emily Nussbaum's vignettes complemented the photos but only scratched the surface of this emotionally charged topic (The Way We Live Now, Oct. 8). Divorce defies the senses. It is not the singular event -- the unceremonious court order -- that severs the relationship; rather, it is the horror of the prelude and the pain of the aftermath. Divorce is disillusionment and the death of hopes and dreams. It is the destruction of the family. Today, more than half of all first marriages end in divorce. As a survivor of the loss of a 26-year marriage, I congratulate your efforts in focusing on this most important topic.</p>
