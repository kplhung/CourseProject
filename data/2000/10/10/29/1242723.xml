        <p>Whoever Wins, the Arts Can't Lose</p>
        <p>If you're still wavering about the Senate race, don't look to arts issues to help you decide. ''Both candidates would be very good for the arts,'' said Nina Ozlu, vice president of public and private sector affairs for Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington.

        <p>Whoever Wins, the Arts Can't Lose</p>
        <p>If you're still wavering about the Senate race, don't look to arts issues to help you decide. ''Both candidates would be very good for the arts,'' said Nina Ozlu, vice president of public and private sector affairs for Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington. ''Both have strong records in supporting federal funding for the arts and have taken leadership positions.''</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio has a 100 percent voting record in the House in support of the National Endowment for the Arts,'' she said. ''During a critical period when the N.E.A. was being attacked, and we needed moderate Republicans to help keep the agency alive, he was in the forefront.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, she said, Hillary Rodham Clinton ''handled arts policy for the White House and is the honorary chairwoman of the president's committee on the arts and humanities. She advises the president on cultural policy issues and headed up the White House's millennium council.''</p>
        <p>Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio have received leadership awards from the organization, which functions as a national clearinghouse for information on the arts.</p>
        <p>Pictures in Pottery and Other Crafts</p>
        <p>If what you've always longed for is a pottery portrait of your dog, then the Crafts on Stage show next weekend at the Performing Arts Center of Purchase College is the place for you. Kaolin Pottery of Great Barrington, Mass., will work a photograph of your pet into nearly the real thing -- in ceramic.</p>
        <p>''You have no idea how many people call up and say 'my dog died and I want a picture of him,' '' said Ruth Marcus, a member of the Prompters, a  volunteer group at the center.  Ms. Marcus and Rhoda Sablow, who have put together eight previous shows to benefit the center, made this year's show more spacious, cutting the number of artisans to 100 from last year's 118.</p>
        <p>Exhibitors, who come from as far away as Maine, also include Jewelry 10, a Long Island company that turns insects into suit ornaments; Judy Flanders of Carmel, who will demonstrate how she weaves Nantucket baskets, and Chong and Judy Lim of Island Designs, who will show how they make metal plates for paper embossing.</p>
        <p>The show is expected to raise $50,000 to support the center's five-theater complex.</p>
        <p>The exhibition opens Friday with a wine and cheese preview from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. at a cost of $15 a person (the ticket will be good for all three days of the show). It continues Saturday from 10 a.m to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., at a cost of $6 a person. Children under 12 are admitted free and will be entertained by a clown and story-tellers. Information: (914) 251-6272.</p>
        <p>Copland Ensemble Honors Centennial</p>
        <p>The Copland House of Cortlandt Manor is in the spotlight now that the composer's centennial is here. Copland would have turned 100 on Nov. 14, and the world is getting to know this quintessential American composer all over again.</p>
        <p>Copland's former home has been refurbished and is functioning as a retreat for young composers. The resident ensemble called Music from the Copland House has been busy traveling to concerts commemorating the centennial. Earlier this month the group played at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. On Nov. 15, the American Music Center will present a Webcast of a concert played by the ensemble from the Copland House in Cortlandt Manor (www.newmusicbox.org). Then, on Nov. 18, the ensemble will be the featured performers in the Copland centennial celebration at the Library of Congress.</p>
        <p>The ensemble will give a free concert of chamber music by Copland and other American composers today at 5 p.m. at the North Castle Public Library in Armonk.</p>
        <p>In an offbeat Copland salute next Sunday at 3 p.m., the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan will present the composer's children's opera, ''The Second Hurricane,'' staged by the Copland House with professional musicians and students. The orchestra will be conducted by Paul Lustig Dunkel, who plays flute in the Copland House ensemble and is its co-director, along with the pianist Michael Boriskin of Bedford Hills. Mr. Boriskin is also the artistic director of the house.</p>
        <p>''The Second Hurricane,'' written in the 1930's, tells of the struggle of a group of teenagers on their way to help hurricane victims. They are engulfed in a second hurricane, where they learn about cooperation and survival. The opera had its premiere in 1937, directed by Orson Welles. This performance, directed by Marcia Milgrom Dodge, uses a new libretto by Susan Kander.  Tickets are $25 and $12.50 for children 15 and under. Information: (212) 996-1100.</p>
