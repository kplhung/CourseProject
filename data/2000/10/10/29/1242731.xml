        <p>JAZZ is undergoing a quiet revival, only it's not where you would expect to find it. It's not in the clubs, though there is plenty of good live music. Nor is it at prestige-enhancing institutions like Lincoln Center, welcome as they are. The revival in jazz is to be found, rather, in the explosion of reissues, first-ever historic recordings and bootlegs.</p>
        <p>The collector can now find everything from benchmarks of the tradition like Louis Armstrong's ''Complete Hot Fives and Sevens,'' to more obscure objects of desire like ''Nerve Beats,'' a striking solo percussion concert from 1973 by the Dutch free jazz drummer Han Bennink. If there's a rare jazz record you want, chances are you can find it, with little effort spent. And when an old recording is discovered in the vault, or simply unearthed after a long out-of-print hibernation, a missing, sometimes crucial piece is restored to the mosaic of jazz history.</p>
        <p>No movement in jazz has profited more from this development than the underground of the 1970's -- the period roughly between John Coltrane's death in 1967 and Wynton Marsalis's arrival on the scene in the early 1980's. Once maligned for its sprawl, excess and indulgence, the 70's avant-garde is now widely admired for those very qualities. It's not clear what prompted this wave of nostalgia: the rediscovery of Miles Davis's electric period, the resurgence of loft-style jazz at New York's Vision Festival over the last few years, a sense of boredom with the classical polish of mainstream jazz. But the result is a staggering number of 70's reissues, most of them produced by boutique labels.</p>
        <p>The last year alone has seen the reissue of significant works by some of the decade's leading musicians, including the Art Ensemble of Chicago, the pianists Muhal Richard Abrams and Sun Ra, the saxophonists Anthony Braxton and Steve Lacy and the trumpeter Don Cherry.</p>
        <p>The best jazz records made in these years have a marvelously raw, provisional status. Like postcards written on a road trip, they're more important for the encounters they describe than for their ultimate destinations. Jazz musicians were on a journey called freedom, and their work reflected the opportunities -- and the burdens -- that liberation from tradition created. They were arguably lonelier than they had ever been in America, which is saying a lot. Some became so lonely that they pandered to the masses with that poor excuse for an opiate known as fusion. The heirs of the free jazz revolution, for their part, took a harder road, taking their art into lofts, performance spaces and ultimately into the streets. They never attracted a large audience, and occasionally their predilection for European dissonances suggested a desire to be left alone. At the same time, they were unusually cosmopolitan in outlook, with strong links to other expressive forms -- visual art, dance, film, new music and, not least, political protest.</p>
        <p>The a-cappella saxophone recital -- a test of solitary creativity if ever there was one -- was among the signature genres of the 70's avant-garde, and Mr. Braxton, a 24-year-old Chicagoan, was its pioneer. Recorded in the summer of '68 in the basement of a South Side community center and released by Delmark in 1971, Mr. Braxton's double album ''For Alto'' is available on disk for the first time in 10 years. Solo saxophone was hardly without precedent: Eric Dolphy, Coleman Hawkins and Sonny Rollins, among others, had all performed the occasional standard without accompaniment. But to make an album of etudes for solo saxophone, as Mr. Braxton did, was an act of singular audacity. Here was some of the thorniest jazz ever made, and Mr. Braxton, a pipe-smoking, chess-playing intellectual, made a perfect mascot for the new abstruseness.</p>
        <p>It was after hearing Karlheinz Stockhausen's forbidding studies for solo piano, the ''Klavierstucke,'' that Mr. Braxton decided to ''create a vocabulary, a syntax for solo saxophone.'' And one has the impression of a man alone with his instrument, probing its inner recesses, defining its outer limits. When the album first appeared, Mr. Braxton's syntax -- whispers, honks, key-tapping, sharp contrasts of speed, volume and timbre -- seemed closer in spirit to Luciano Berio's ''Sequenza'' series and the ''Klavierstucke'' than to Ornette Coleman and  Albert Ayler. Not surprisingly, some of Mr. Braxton's fellow saxophonists were not at all pleased by what they heard. ''He should learn to play the saxophone first,'' said Phil Woods. ''There's a lot of primitives that play and get a lot of exciting music, but this is such an ego trip.'' Few listeners at the time picked up on Mr. Braxton's allusions to  Lester Young and Paul Desmond and even some country blues wailing.</p>
        <p>The soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy was one of the first reed players to take up Mr. Braxton's challenge. ''Snips,'' a two-disk set released for the first time by Jazz Magnet records, is a recording of a 1976 solo concert Mr. Lacy gave at Environ, a loft on lower Broadway owned by one of Dave Brubeck's brothers. In a photograph taken at the concert, Mr. Lacy looks characteristically urbane, dressed in black and standing in front of a large abstract painting. It was Mr. Lacy's first time playing solo in the United States -- he had moved to Paris seven years earlier -- and the concert drew a large crowd.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, one of the fans, Jim Eigo, smuggled in a Sony Walkman with a built-in condenser mike; he then let the tape sit on a shelf for the next 24 years. The sound, as you would expect, is muffled at times. But it's exciting to hear the room that Mr. Lacy is playing in -- the shuffling of feet, the door creaking open as someone walks in, the congenial noise of people having fun.</p>
        <p>The record is named after a piece in which Mr. Lacy snips a pair of scissors in the air -- you can just make this out -- and then reproduces and elaborates on this pattern with his horn. The album is evenly divided between the Monk-flavored tunes that Mr. Lacy had perfected and more daring excursions that blur the line between jazz and performance art. In ''The New York Duck,'' for example, Mr. Lacy literally quacks through his straight horn. It's a bracing, and humorous, flurry of effects, and the audience replies with knowing laughter.</p>
        <p>Some jazz musicians preferred a less rarefied kind of modernism than Mr. Braxton's and Mr. Lacy's. The Art Ensemble of Chicago, for instance, combined advanced techniques and vernacular materials in the manner of the poets of the Black Arts Movement. The ensemble's recording ''Les Stances a Sophie,'' originally released on EMI France, has been reissued in a handsome package by the London label Universal Sound.</p>
        <p>''Les Stances,'' one of 15 records the group made during its 18-month sojourn in Paris, was recorded on July 22, 1970 as a soundtrack for a long-forgotten film of the same name. It is a short record, just 34 minutes long, but its breadth is dazzling. The opening ''Theme de Yo Yo'' is a deliciously lusty showcase for the rhythm and blues singer Fontella Bass, who was married at the time to Lester Bowie, the band's trumpeter. ''Your love is like an oil well/ dig, dig, dig it!'' she sings. ''Your body's like Camembert/ melting from its skin!''</p>
        <p>If you're wondering what an experimental jazz band is doing serving up unadulterated soul, you'll be even more puzzled by what comes next: the magisterial dirge ''Proverbes,'' with its evocations of the final movement of Coltrane's ''Love Supreme,'' which segues into a veritable Arab bazaar of droning flutes and musette. Incongruous? By traditional standards, yes. But then these are exactly the expectations that the Art Ensemble was determined to flout, with its program of presenting ''great black music, ancient to future.'' And on ''Les Stances a Sophie'' the music of the African diaspora resembles a tree with many branches, nourished by the same rich soil, the music's ''changing same,'' as the poet and critic Amiri Baraka once put it.</p>
        <p>MR. BARAKA'S electrifying speech at a black political conference in 1970 in Gary, Ind., provided the inspiration for Joe McPhee's ''Nation Time,'' which has just been reissued on the critic John Corbett's Unheard Music series for Atavistic, a Chicago-based label. An intriguing document of free-jazz agitprop, ''Nation Time'' was originally recorded for CjR records, five months after ''Les Stances,'' during a concert for a black studies center at Vassar College, where Mr. McPhee was teaching a course called -- what else? -- ''Revolution in Sound.'' The title track, a 24-bar composition based on a four-note motif stated with blunt force by Mr. McPhee on tenor, begins with the question Mr. Baraka had posed to his audience earlier that year: ''What time is it?''</p>
        <p>''Nation time!'' the students roar. But Mr. McPhee isn't quite satisfied.</p>
        <p>''Ah, come on now,'' he says, ''you can do better than that!'' And so they do, returning at the close of the piece for another round of call-and-response.</p>
        <p>With the exhilarating, gospel-tinged accompaniment of Mike Kullon on piano, ''Nation Time'' feels like a service in the church of black power, where the congregants can see the promised land just around the corner.</p>
        <p>What the 70's jazz underground generated, then, were two modernisms, hermetic and populist, both of them reflections of jazz's solitude in a music culture dominated by pop. And if you went to a New York loft in those days, you were likely to hear both kinds of jazz, often played by the very same musicians. This is the fertile dialectic of most avant-gardes, and it was in full Hegelian bloom at Studio Rivbea, the Bond Street loft of the saxophonist Sam Rivers and his wife, Bea.</p>
        <p>Knitmedia (the label of the downtown club the Knitting Factory) has just reissued ''Wildflowers: The New York Loft Jazz Sessions,'' a three-disk set documenting a weeklong festival at Studio Rivbea in the spring of 1976. More than 100 musicians from New York, St. Louis and Chicago descended on Bond Street, and almost everybody who was anybody in free jazz was there. (The critic Stanley Crouch, who was just a few years away from becoming the movement's most distinguished and feisty renegade, played drums with a band led by his then protege, the saxophonist David Murray.)</p>
        <p>There is, to be sure, some unruly, even ugly stuff, but for the most part these sessions undercut the idea that loft jazz exalted energy for its own sake. What's astonishing is the range of expressive styles, from the languid chamber jazz of the saxophonists Julius Hemphill and Oliver Lake to the percussive Africanisms of the pianist Randy Weston and the drummer Sunny Murray to the garrulous New Orleans-inspired blues of the baritone saxophonist Hamiet Bluiett. It was the credo of the musicians gathered at Sam and Bea Rivers's Bond Street greenhouse to let a thousand flowers bloom, and wildflowers they were.</p>
