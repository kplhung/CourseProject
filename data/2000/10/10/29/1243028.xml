        <p>If there is one place that Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio have butted heads -- figuratively, of course -- it is in upstate New York. To judge by their schedules (and the television images), the barnstorming candidates have attended every parade, pancake breakfast and preschool pageant north of Peekskill.</p>
        <p>Their views on the upstate economy could hardly be more different. Mrs. Clinton sees upstate as deeply distressed, left out of the boom that has transformed New York City. Mr. Lazio contends that it has turned the corner economically, although he acknowledges that more needs to be done. She calls him an ostrich; he calls her a gloom-monger.</p>
        <p>But if you travel around the state, reading the newspapers, eating in diners, talking to businesspeople and firefighters and lacrosse moms -- behaving, in short, like a candidate without the cameras -- you can discover something rather odd: both would-be senators are right.</p>
        <p>Not about the name-calling. About the economy.</p>
        <p>The upstate economy is certainly not in free fall the way it was just a few years ago, and in some places it has gotten a whole lot better. But the economic climate upstate does not seem nearly as vibrant as it does in the Hudson Valley, on Long Island or in New York City. Things are up upstate, but from a very depressed base.</p>
        <p>H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and a likely Democratic candidate for governor in 2002, agrees with Mrs. Clinton, a fellow Democrat. More surprisingly, he also agrees with Mr. Lazio, her Republican opponent. ''One candidate has been more critical, which is helpful, and one has been more optimistic,'' he said. ''I think they are both right.'' How can that be? The employment numbers upstate have improved, he said, but upstate residents ''kind of expected to catch the boom downstate they hear so much about, and they know they are not doing as well.''</p>
        <p>Any understanding of upstate New York requires knowledge of things that may at first seem far afield from economics: history, geography, technology, psychology. And it must take into account one of the most unusual aspects of upstate: its steep population loss.</p>
        <p>But getting a grip on upstate is not easy, in part because the place is so big and diverse. Drive north from New York City to Albany, 144 miles, and you will not even be halfway to the northern tip of the state. Hang a left for Dunkirk, and you are in for at least a five-hour drive. (It's 320 miles to the west.)</p>
        <p>Blue-collar Buffalo, the state's second-largest city, has a not-so-friendly rivalry with white-collar Rochester, 70 miles away, and neither of them has too much in common with the Capital Region. Every upstate city or town seems to have not only its own favorite food, but also its own favorite sausages, from tiny-tinies in Troy to red hots in Lockport and white hot dogs in between (a Rochester specialty).</p>
        <p>Economic conditions vary just as widely. In Buffalo, the number of jobs has edged up just 0.3 percent in the 12 months that ended in September, according to the State Department of Labor. Meanwhile, the average increase nationally was 2 percent, and in New York City the number of jobs rose by 2.5 percent. No wonder Buffalo citizens say they are dubious about the boom.</p>
        <p>Head east to Glens Falls, north of Albany, and it is a different story. Jobs are growing there even faster than in New York City, by 2.7 percent. Unemployment is less than 3 percent, meaning that, basically, everybody who wants a job can get one.</p>
        <p>Companies in the Glens Falls area, especially those that make medical equipment, are expanding rapidly, said Maury Thompson, the business reporter for The Post-Star in Glens Falls. ''Every week I'm writing about 20 new jobs here, 15 new jobs there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But whether people are satisfied depends a lot on whom you ask. Mr. Thompson said he was also writing about the woes of workers who until recently made $12 or $14 an hour at pulp or packaging plants that are now closed. They found new jobs quickly, but for less than $10 an hour, so they feel as if they are struggling to get by.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing has been declining for decades across America, so some of upstate's troubles are not unique. In some places, like Syracuse, manufacturing employment has actually been climbing, slowly, since 1997. In fact, overall employment has been rising there since 1993.</p>
        <p>So why do some people there, and across New York State, describe their cities and towns in apocalyptic terms? The short answer is population loss.</p>
        <p>Losing population can have a profound effect on a place. A city's tax collections shrink, but the same number of roads have to be plowed, and services like garbage collection and firefighting still have to be provided.  Politicians, fighting over a shrinking pie, become even less cooperative. (Many parts of upstate are famous for their ferocious partisan politics.)</p>
        <p>True, unemployment rates are low, but it is not because jobs are plentiful; it is just that workers are scarce. Big companies are often reluctant to move to a place with a shrinking population, for fear that they will not be able to fill future jobs.</p>
        <p>And it is all too easy for communities to become insular; there are towns in New York where it seems as if every resident was born at the local hospital. Nostalgia for the glory days can have a tight grip, even if the last great time was when the Erie Canal opened in 1825.</p>
        <p>For the worst case, look at Buffalo. From 1950 to 1990, a quarter of a million people -- 43 percent of the population -- moved away. Of course, twice as many left New York City, but they accounted for less than 10 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>Since then, the population trends of the state's two biggest cities have diverged. Because of foreign immigration, downstate has been growing. According to federal census estimates, New York City and Long Island have gained 246,000 residents since 1990, but the total gain statewide is only 206,000. That means the upstate population has continued to dwindle, by about 40,000 residents.</p>
        <p>The city of Buffalo now has fewer than 300,000 residents and has lost more than 30,000 people in the last decade, according to Census Bureau estimates. Some of them moved only to the suburbs, but the population of the whole metropolitan area fell by 4 percent from 1990 to 1999. Rochester shrank, too, as did Syracuse, Binghamton, Jamestown and Elmira.</p>
        <p>Utica and Rome, two small and neighboring cities near the heart of New York State, lost more than 7 percent of their population, almost 24,000 people, from 1990 to 1999, according to new data from the Census Bureau. The only metropolitan area that fared worse was Grand Forks, N.D.</p>
        <p>Like Syracuse and other places around the state, Utica now finds itself with far too much housing, some of it abandoned, said Kevin M. Kelly, a self-described ''social activist of the genteel sort'' and president of a retail lumber company in New Hartford, just south of Utica.</p>
        <p>Given the nature of his business, Mr. Kelly might be expected to press for people to repair those abandoned homes, which he estimates account for 10 percent of the housing stock. But, he contends, there are just not enough people to fill them; he wants them torn down. ''The sooner these buildings are gone,'' he said, ''the better we will feel.''</p>
        <p>Many people upstate are not waiting for the federal government to solve their problems. They are taking matters into their own hands and trying different approaches.</p>
        <p>Buffalo finally abandoned its infighting to start a strong regional advertising effort. In Rochester, small entrepreneurs are picking up the slack left by layoffs at Kodak, Xerox and Bausch &amp; Lomb. In tiny Clyde, retirees have returned home to try to improve the tourism trade. Syracuse is knocking down its abandoned housing, Troy is improving its waterfront, and Ogdensburg, far to the north, is experimenting with industrial recruitment efforts.</p>
        <p>But drawing attention to the strengths of upstate may be the most important way that any federal politician can help the region.</p>
        <p>Outsiders who travel there are often struck by the beauty of the countryside, the wonderful old houses, the charming downtowns, even the number of golf courses, which, along with the decreasing number of people, make it easy to get a tee time.</p>
        <p>Of course, you have to ''like the four seasons'': upstate-speak for ''it snows here.'' But it snows in Colorado, too, and Colorado is booming.</p>
        <p>So as the candidates make their final swings through upstate, a central question remains: ''How do you bring back the skilled people who you lost in the calamity of the early 1990's?'' asked Marc Goloven, an ebullient economist for Chase Manhattan Bank who sees upstate as a hot growth area. ''The major challenge now is to ensure that people follow the jobs now being created.''</p>
