        <p>Ancient Burying Ground</p>
        <p>''Prepare for Death and Follow Me,'' beckons the brochure for a self-guided tour of Hartford's 360-year-old Ancient Burying Ground, the city's oldest surviving historic site. The folders will be distributed at two Halloween walking tours of the four-acre cemetery on Tuesday at noon and 5 p.m. They may also be obtained by calling (860) 561-2585.</p>
        <p>The earlier tour will cost $6, the 5 p.m. tour, lit by jack-o'-lanterns and ending with cider and doughnuts will be $8 and is not recommended for children under 10. Reservations for the 5 p.m. tour only are required by calling the same number.</p>
        <p>William Hosley, executive director of the Antiquarian and Landmark Society and former curator of the Ancient Burying Ground, will act as tour guide, touching on some of the causes of death in early Hartford, including executions for witchcraft.  Mary Skinner, 41, died of emotional and physical exhaustion after bearing 10 children, all of whom died in infancy. And Captain Israel Seymour met his demise at the wrong end of a bolt of lightning while standing in the doorway of his house. More than 400 gravestones are visible at the site, just behind the First Church of Christ at the corner of Main and Gold Streets, but from 1640 to the early 1800's some 6,000 people were buried there. The Ancient Burying Ground is open Monday through Saturday from 10 to 4, Sunday from 10 to 2. Admission is free.</p>
        <p>Momix Dance Company</p>
        <p>Moses Pendleton's Momix Dance Company will perform a program of short pieces on Friday at 8 and Saturday at 2 and 8 at the Shubert Performing Arts Center in New Haven.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pendleton was a co-founder of Pilobolus and began his own five-member company in the mid 1980's. Momix choreography evolves out of his spontaneous ideas, improvisation and the dancers' input. Athleticism, humor and fantasy are intertwined with music, props, film and lighting to produce performances that have been acclaimed in 22 countries and seen on television in 55 countries.</p>
        <p>Tickets are $10 to $32 and may be reserved by calling (203) 562-5666. The Shubert is located at 247 College Street.</p>
        <p>Puppet Show for Grown-Ups</p>
        <p>Paul Zaloom's three solo performances at Connecticut College in New London involve a kind of puppetry in which he instantly recycles rubbish, velvet paintings, tools, Slinky toys, fake flowers into characters, and also uses hand, rod and dummy puppets, animation and overhead projections.</p>
        <p>Breathtaking in its furious pace, wide-ranging in its antic comedy, what is essentially a puppet show for grown-ups has received a ''Bessie'' (New York Dance and Performance Award), an Obie, an American Theater Wing Design Award, four National Endowment for the Arts fellowships, three Henson Foundation grants, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaloom has written, designed and performed nine full-length shows since the early 90's, including ''Fruit of Zaloom,'' ''Sick But True'' and ''The House of Horrors.''</p>
        <p>Performances in the Tansill Black Box Theater are scheduled on Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 7:30 as part of the college's OntheEdge Series of avant garde theaterworks. Tickets at $18, half-price for children and students, may be reserved by calling (860) 439-2787 (ARTS).</p>
        <p>Paintings With a Twist</p>
        <p>Paintings by Steve Di Giovanni are figurative, narrative, gritty and magnetic. An exhibition of his work may be seen at the Norwalk Community College Art Gallery through Nov. 11.</p>
        <p>''I am trying to walk a line between narrative meaning and nonsense,'' he said. And he does. The gutsy reality of the paintings are at odds with the unexplained goings on among the subjects. A working class couple -- tough guy in his undershirt having a beer, wiry woman smoking a cigarette, only half of her in the picture, pile of printed matter on the table of their unappetizing kitchen -- what are they thinking? A muscular man, stripped to waist, messing around with a bandaged bare foot in a doctor's waiting room. Why? A woman sits stone-faced next to him and a big man taking off his jacket stares down at him.</p>
        <p>Hours at the gallery, located in the east campus building at 188 Richards Avenue, are Monday through Thursday from 9 to 9, Friday from 9 to 4 and Saturday from 9 to noon. For more information call (203) 857-7197.</p>
        <p>Einstein's Brain</p>
        <p>Remember that pathologist who stole Albert Einstein's brain and drove across the country with a journalist while the brain floated in a Tupperware container in the trunk? The journalist, Michael Paterniti, author of ''Driving Mr. Albert: A Trip Across America With Einstein's Brain,'' will talk about the experience today at 5 p.m. at the Darien Library, where his mother works.</p>
        <p>The book is part travelogue, part biography, part meditation, part history, and all true. In 1997, Dr. Thomas Harvey performed the autopsy on Einstein and appropriated his brain, embarking on one of the strangest journeys ever attempted in a rented Buick.</p>
        <p>The library is at 35 Leroy Avenue and the numbers for more information are (203) 655-1234, ext. 118 or (203) 655-1234, ext. 112.</p>
        <p>Cello Concerts</p>
        <p>The six Unaccompanied Cello Suites of Johann Sebastian Bach will be performed in two Sunday concerts by James Nicholas, cellist for several Connecticut orchestras, composer, editor of editions of Bach's solo string music, and former student of Janos Starker and Fritz Magg at Indiana University.</p>
        <p>The performances commemorate the 250th anniversary of Bach's death in 1750 and will be presented at South Church, 90 Main Street in New Britain. The first concert is scheduled this afternoon at four, the second will be held next Sunday at the same hour. Admission is free but an offering will be appreciated. Call (860) 223-7555 for more information or directions.</p>
