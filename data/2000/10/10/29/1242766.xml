        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Roses, many roses, to Joseph Horowitz for his two fine articles on Boston's Symphony Hall and on Henry Lee Higginson, who commissioned it and who single-handedly founded and then financed the Boston Symphony Orchestra for so many years [''A Plain Home With a Sense of Pride'' and ''Finding a New Music Director the Old-Fashioned Way,'' Oct. 8].</p>
        <p>A brickbat, however, for what in my opinion is a misreading of John Singer Sargent's portrait of Higginson, of which you reproduced a detail. To my eye his expression is not ''haughty and elevated,'' but rather one of warm, curious amusement at finding himself willy-nilly in such a situation at age 70, the portrait having been commissioned by Harvard and paid for by student subscription as thanks for and commemoration of his having built the Student Union.</p>
