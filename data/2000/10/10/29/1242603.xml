        <p>The Girl in the Picture</p>
        <p>The Story of Kim Phuc, the Photograph, and the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>By Denise Chong.</p>
        <p>Viking, $25.95.</p>
        <p>On June 8, 1972, Kim Phuc, trying to outrun the globules of napalm that seared the flesh off her back, ran into the pages of history. The photograph of this 9-year-old South Vietnamese peasant girl fleeing an inadvertent attack from her own (American-backed) air force became a defining image of the war. And as Denise Chong writes in ''The Girl in the Picture,'' what happened to Phuc and her family after the Americans had gone was as hurtful as the napalm. Asked to bare her scars for countless photographs, Phuc was trotted out to foreign reporters as an example of the triumph of socialism and the evils of American involvement in Vietnam. Being a pawn for the Communist government became a full-time job, and she was not allowed to go to college. With her family, whose business was being taxed out of existence thanks to anticapitalist policies, Phuc was so poor she often went hungry, but was required to play the role of happy, productive revolutionary. Her plight finally came to the attention of the Vietnamese prime minister, Pham Van Dong; she was allowed to leave Vietnam to study in Cuba, where she met her husband, a fellow Vietnamese student. She defected to Canada, stepping off the plane en route to a honeymoon in Moscow. And there Chong's book abruptly ends. For anyone unacquainted with the details of the Vietnam War and its aftermath. ''The Girl in the Picture'' provides an absorbing, if skewed, history lesson. The famous photo and Phuc's story are a metaphor for the senselessness of the Vietnam War. Looking at the image years later, Phuc reflected that she ''didn't know how it had started, who the enemy was, who was fighting whom, who was winning or how it would, or could, end.''</p>
