        <p>The scent of crushed or powdered juniper berries delivers a suggestion of shelter -- the heady camphor and resin of a pine grove, the spice of humus underfoot, the lemony warmth of a pale sun filtering through branches. It has the flavor of something warm and earthy in the midst of a cold, wild world.</p>
        <p>Juniper berries make you feel taken care of in a let's-huddle-around-the-campfire sort of way. A potent secret for winter dishes, they are traditionally teamed with pork, game (particularly venison and, in Italy, wild boar) and, as the key aromatic in the traditional French choucroute, with cabbage.</p>
        <p>When holding forth on the delights of juniper berries, which, by the way, are always used crushed and never whole, we cannot, of course, bypass gin. Gin is flavored with the berry's essential oil. Its name is derived, as is the English ''juniper,'' from that of the sprawling evergreen shrub -- known botanically as Juniperus communis -- that traditionally thrives in chalky soil throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Unearthing a stash of the all-spice-size, violet-blue berries from the back of the spice cabinet, we can be forgiven for forsaking culinary pursuits in favor of a nice, stiff drink.</p>
        <p>Still, juniper's culinary possibilities overwhelm. In addition to its most common uses, juniper makes magic with rabbit, apples, eggs, bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, apples, firm-fleshed fish, even lobster. Yet both here in America and in Scandinavia, where juniper is widely used to cure fish, chefs rarely employ the spice in mainstream meal preparation.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason may be that juniper is potent. The possibility of overwhelming a dish and ending up with something that tastes and smells like eau de turpentine looms large. But though a splash of gin can be substituted for crushed or powdered berries in a recipe, the alcohol lacks their depth and nuance. The same can be said of other spirits distilled from or flavored with juniper, like aquavit and schnapps.</p>
        <p>I suggest proceeding with juniper as if testing ice underfoot: gingerly. But do proceed. Juniper loops past and present together in a hopeful narrative. The earliest mention of the spice dates back to Egyptian scrolls of 2800 B.C. Like so many other ancient aromatics, juniper was long the subject of folk tales and folk cures. Legend holds that the Holy Family took shelter from King Herod in the boughs of a prickly juniper bush, giving rise to the belief that the tree had magical protective properties. Perhaps these legends also helped define juniper's role in the herbal pharmacy, where it has long been touted as a stimulant, diuretic and remedy for stomachaches.</p>
        <p>Modern-day research into the Navajo tribe's traditional eating habits has proved that the ash from juniper branches, which is widely used to season food, is a potent source of calcium and also contains magnesium and iron. As a poultice, juniper has been used to treat rheumatism, aching muscles, even gout. In its vaporized form, the berry battles congestion. Sometimes relief comes from breathing in the steam from, say, a juniper-scented duck stew. Either way, the perky spice is liable to leave a winter cook feeling clearheaded and suddenly buoyant.</p>
        <p>Something upbeat occurs when juniper is afoot. A cook may draw inspiration from it: in New York, Jean-Georges Vongerichten deploys juniper in a fennel-and-apple salad; in Boston, Jasper White uses juniper-scented broth to steam bass. Sometimes, however, chefs favor tradition and keep their exotic accents in check, venturing forth only to season scrambled eggs with a few judicious flecks of juniper, to perfume a sauce for poached eggs with it, to tuck it into a pork loin with garlic and sage or to team it up with rosemary and venison.</p>
        <p>Whether cooking on the edge or with a sense of history in mind, the juniper-armed maestro will eventually become bewitched by a whiff of the powerful berry. Yes, there is a safe, warm place. Be exhilarated by it, but don't get inebriated.</p>
        <p>Juniper-Flavored Gravlax  (Adapted from Aquavit restaurant, New York)  4 cups kosher salt</p>
        <p>1/2 cup granulated sugar  2 tablespoons cracked white peppercorns  2 teaspoons juniper berries, crushed  2 pounds center-cut salmon fillet, skin on  3 bunches fresh dill  2 tablespoons gin.</p>
        <p>1. In a bowl, combine the salt, sugar, peppercorns and juniper. Using your hands, rub 1 cup of the mixture all over the salmon. Transfer to a glass baking dish and cover with the remaining mixture. Scatter dill over the salmon and set aside at room temperature for 2 1/2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 to 5 days.</p>
        <p>2. When ready to serve, remove plastic and discard dill. Transfer the salmon to a cutting board and drizzle with the gin. Slice thinly on the diagonal. Serve with bread and garnishes of choice.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 to 16 first courses.</p>
        <p>Apple-and-Bread Dumplings in Juniper-Scented Chicken Broth  31-day-old Kaiser or other white bread rolls (about 12 ounces), thickly sliced  1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p>
        <p>1/2 small Spanish onion, minced  1 clove garlic, minced  1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and cut into small dice</p>
        <p>1/4 cup coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
        <p>1/2 cup whole milk  2 teaspoons juniper berries, crushed  4 cups homemade or low-sodium canned chicken broth  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper  1 large egg, beaten</p>
        <p>1/4 cup all-purpose flour.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet and bake until dry, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool enough to handle. Cut bread into large cubes and transfer to a large bowl.</p>
        <p>2. In a skillet, over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the apple and cook, stirring, until somewhat soft, about 2 minutes more. Add 3 tablespoons of parsley and the milk and bring to a boil. Pour the boiling mixture over the bread, stir to combine and let sit for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, put the juniper berries and broth in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes. Strain broth and discard the juniper. Return broth to the saucepan. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.</p>
        <p>4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Season the bread mixture with salt and pepper to taste and stir in the egg. Using wet hands, form the bread mixture into 8 firmly packed balls. Place flour on a plate. Roll the balls in the flour. Cook in the simmering water until firm, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. Using a slotted spoon, remove the dumplings from the water and divide among 4 soup bowls. Reheat the broth over high heat and pour it over them. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Juniper-and-Beer-Braised Short Ribs</p>
        <p>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil  3 1/2 pounds beef short ribs, trimmed of excess fat  Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/2 large Spanish onion, coarsely chopped  1 small carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped  1 rib celery, coarsely chopped  2 teaspoons tomato paste  1 1/2 teaspoons juniper berries, crushed  5 sprigs fresh thyme  1 12-ounce bottle dark beer  1 1/2 cups homemade or low-sodium canned chicken broth  1 teaspoon honey  Chopped parsley for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a Dutch oven or large casserole with a tightly fitting lid, over high heat, heat  3/4cup of the oil. Sprinkle the ribs with salt and pepper. Place the flour on a plate. Roll ribs in flour until well coated. Working in 2 batches, cook the ribs, turning occasionally until well browned, 7 minutes per batch. Using tongs, transfer to a plate.</p>
        <p>2. Drain the oil and return the Dutch oven to medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the onion, carrot and celery. Cook, stirring, until soft and brown, about 7 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, about 1 minute more. Return the ribs to the Dutch oven, add the juniper, thyme, beer and broth. Bring to a boil, cover, place in the oven and bake until tender, about 2 hours.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer the ribs to a baking sheet, cover with foil and keep warm. Using a sieve over a saucepan, strain the liquid. Place saucepan over high heat, bring to a boil and cook, uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir in the honey.</p>
        <p>4. Transfer the ribs to a serving platter, pour the reduced beef liquid over them and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with buttered pasta, rice or mashed potatoes.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Chilled 'Gin' Custards  1 1/2 cups heavy cream  1 cup whole milk  1 1/2 teaspoons juniper berries, crushed  5 large egg yolks  6 tablespoons granulated sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon iodized salt  Confectioners' sugar for dusting.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a medium heavy-bottom saucepan, combine the cream, milk and juniper. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture boils. Remove from the heat and set aside, covered, to steep for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. In a large bowl, whisk together the yolks, sugar and salt. Whisking constantly, very slowly add the hot-cream mixture into the eggs until fully incorporated. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve.</p>
        <p>3. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and place four 8-ounce ramekins or custard cups into a roasting pan. Divide the egg mixture between the ramekins. Pour enough boiling water into the roasting pan (not into the ramekins) to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the custard's edges are set but the centers are still somewhat loose, about 55 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Remove from water and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 1 hour. Place confectioners' sugar in a fine sieve and shake over the custards. Serve cold.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
