        <p>The Beast God</p>
        <p>Forgot to Invent</p>
        <p>By Jim Harrison.</p>
        <p>274 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Atlantic Monthly Press. $24.</p>
        <p>The rap against Jim Harrison's fiction -- before, at any rate, he began smuggling female heroines into his novels (''Dalva'') and occasionally affecting a more elegiac tone (''Legends of the Fall'') -- was that his male characters tended to be macho lunkheads. Harrison didn't do much to dispel his he-man image. Writing in Esquire in 1983, he merrily labeled his feminist detractors ''brie brains'' and ''spit dribblers'' before tossing off this memorable line: ''Even now, far up in the wilderness in my cabin, where I just shot a lamprey passing upstream with my Magnum, I wouldn't have the heart to turn down a platter of hot buttered cheerleaders.''</p>
        <p>Well, there you have it, I remember thinking to myself at the time -- Harrison's sensibility boiled down into a crunchy sound bite. But I also remember thinking (after I spent a few hours shaking the image of those cheerleaders out of my head): Couldn't Harrison have done an even slightly better job of defending himself?</p>
        <p>Rereading Harrison's gruff and picaresque early novels -- Wolf,'' ''Warlock,'' ''A Good Day to Die'' -- you're struck not just by how well they've held up, but at how subversive and deft his satire is: nearly all the humor in these books is directed at his aggressive, but somehow bewildered, antiheroes. They fantasize about sex but rarely have any; they're given to pratfalls like showing up at fancy restaurants not knowing they have butter smeared on their lapels. They're louts, but they're tender, easily wounded louts. (Imagine a Robert Stone character who trips over his own shoelaces every 15 pages or so, and you've got the idea.) That these men so closely resemble Harrison himself, often right down to owning a cabin in upper Michigan and being blind in one eye, only adds to the sense of playfulness. There's a splinter faction among Harrison's admirers who feel that these books tower over his calmer, more measured work, and in a pinch I'd vote with them to kick his other stuff off the island.</p>
        <p>Harrison's new book, ''The Beast God Forgot to Invent,'' is a collection of three loose-limbed novellas, and in them he revisits the kind of blinkered tough guys we've met in his early work -- only now they're older (Harrison himself is 62) and more ruminative, if no more wise and no less horny. These days, Harrison's alpha males tend to be on restricted diets and are serious about getting in their nap time. They are also grievously aware of the fact that once you are over 50, as one of them puts it, women ''look just over your head as if you were</p>
        <p>a janitor.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, you don't read Harrison's books for plot; instead, you read them for the way that Harrison tattoos every available surface with scattershot ruminations on food, art, Hawaiian shirts, martinis, shotguns, getting lost in the woods, ogling women, you name it. Thus we can dispense with the ''action'' in these novellas fairly quickly. In the first, a ''semi-retired'' rare books dealer from Chicago -- who, of course, owns a cabin in upper Michigan -- mourns the loss of an exuberant young friend who has died, probably a suicide. (He also mourns the fact that the young man's sexy former girlfriends won't even sleep with him out of pity.) In the second novella, a Michigan Indian walks across greater Los Angeles with $49 in his pocket, trying to find a bear skin that was stolen from him. And in the final novella, we meet a callow journalist who writes quickie books called ''Bioprobes'' about such luminaries as Michael Eisner. If these three characters sound fairly distinct from one another, you'll have to trust me on this: in terms of voice and attitude, they're all pretty much the same guy.</p>
        <p>The quality of Harrison's food and sex writing (his two major preoccupations) hasn't diminished a bit. Harrison's men have always been what you might call caveman gourmands, and you're not surprised that in the first novella, the rare books dealer turns out to be the kind of guy who not only uncorks a $300 Chteau d'Yquem to drink with his morning pancakes but is just as overjoyed to stumble on a can of Franco-American spaghetti in the local grocery store. As for sex, what other writer this side of Nicholson Baker would have a character spy a young woman in a ''blue-flowered summer skirt'' and enthuse, ''The great Picasso would have leapt on her like a flying squirrel''? The men don't get all the good lines, either. In the final novella, a woman suggests why bodily appetites are more important in Manhattan than elsewhere: ''There's no nature in New York,'' she says, ''and the closest you can get is an orgasm.''</p>
        <p>What makes these novellas darker and more emotionally complicated than Harrison's earlier work is a strong whiff of mortality. ''I have certainly rounded third base and am headed for home plate, which is a hole in the ground,'' the rare books dealer says. These men are tormented by the wrong choices they've made in their lives, and they (morosely, stupidly) try to convince themselves that only a new woman can rescue them: ''Right now I feel that my human tank is drained and I am the sediment, the scum on the bottom, the excrescence of my own years,'' one of them says. ''It occurs to me that the memory of Sonia sitting in the chair a few feet from where I am now may have precipitated this funk. Nothing so much torments a geezer as the thought of the unlived life. For some reason she summons up an image of a steelworker shoveling coal into a blast furnace.''</p>
        <p>Harrison has never been the most exacting writer on the planet, but occasionally his scruffiness crosses over into sloppiness. There's a funny description in a sex scene from ''Warlock'' (1981) -- She lunged forward, yanking at his part as if to start an outboard motor'' -- that is repeated almost word for word here. And Harrison tends to use the same adjectives (notably ''otiose,'' a longtime favorite of his) so often that you wonder if he has special symbols for them on his keyboard.</p>
        <p>But these are minor sins. What wins you over in the end is the big, wet, sloppy kiss Harrison continues to plant on the face of life itself. In ''The Beast God Forgot to Invent,'' the biggest praise he has for anyone is to remark, ''He's literally taking bites out of the sun, moon and earth.'' Which is a far better description of Harrison's sensibility than anything you can say about hot buttered cheerleaders.</p>
