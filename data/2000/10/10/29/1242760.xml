        <p>In your recent article ''Graying of the Arts: Who Will Take Over'' [Oct. 22], you neglected to discuss an even more serious problem, the graying of the audience. As the president of the Massapequa Philharmonic Orchestra and the keeper of our mailing list of approximately 2,000, I can tell you that the list is barely growing, maybe 20 a year, and the graying audience is dwindling rapidly, due to death and infirmity, and not being replaced by younger adults.</p>
        <p>This is happening in spite of the fact that our concerts are free and no tickets are required, so it is only necessary to show up at the concert hall, claim a seat and then listen to some of the outstanding young soloists of our time.</p>

        <p>Although students on Long Island seem to be playing musical instruments in record numbers, their parents do not seem to have any interest in taking them to classical music concerts, and most likely the children are unable to attend a concert without a chaperone. If this situation persists, there will be no need for future administrators.</p>
