        <p>THE word costumes brings to mind slender mannequins dressed in fashionable period clothes -- ball gowns, perhaps, or outstanding examples of what ladies and gentlemen once wore to a wedding or a coronation.

        <p>THE word costumes brings to mind slender mannequins dressed in fashionable period clothes -- ball gowns, perhaps, or outstanding examples of what ladies and gentlemen once wore to a wedding or a coronation. Yet the holdings of the costume and textile collection of the Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford were not chosen for their aesthetic appeal -- although some of them are handsome indeed -- but for their historical associations, for what they bring to our understanding of the past.</p>
        <p>In recognition of the collection's importance, the society was recently awarded two grants totaling more than $225,000: $50,000 from the Institute of Museum and Library Services for conservation and treatment of 25 rare and important items and $175,865 from the National Endowment for the Humanities to be used to improve access to and interpretation of the costume collection.</p>
        <p>''Our collection has a very strong connection to Connecticut history,'' said Susan P. Schoelwer, the director of museum collections, who will manage the two projects. ''We have incredible examples from the Revolutionary War era, clothing donated during the 1840's by the widows and kids of men who fought in the war.''</p>
        <p>During the mid-1800's, Ms. Schoelwer said, the historical society expanded its acquisition program to include artifacts as well as library items. Now, 175 years after the society's founding, the costume and textile collection is one of the largest in New England, totaling more than 8,000 pieces: women's, men's and children's clothing and accessories as well as needlework, dating from the 17th century to the present.</p>
        <p>''The pieces illuminate a spectrum of historical experiences and themes  -- the stories of patriots as well as Tories, of rich and influential people as well as ordinary folk,'' Ms. Schoelwer said. ''In addition, approximately 40 percent of the collection can be linked to identifiable makers or owners.''</p>
        <p>Locating items has not always been easy, however, because existing records are inadequate. A sizable portion of the two-year grant will go toward hiring two new staff members who will upgrade the catalogs, to make the collections as accessible as possible and strengthen the cross referencing, ''so people will be able to look up a person, find out what museum items are related and also find out what he wore,'' said Ms. Schoelwer. ''Nothing makes connections more personal than clothing.''</p>
        <p>One of the most important items in the collection is a wool broadcloth coat worn during the American Revolution by Monson Hoyt of Norwalk, a Tory officer who, after the war, became a business partner of Benedict Arnold's.</p>
        <p>''The moths had a feast on it,'' said Kathleen Craughwell-Varda, a costume specialist acting as consulting curator on the project. Spreading the garment gingerly across a table in the collection storage room, she pointed a white-gloved finger at the holes in the still-bright red coat.</p>
        <p>''We will have to make a decision on how to go about conserving this,'' she said. When it comes to replacing damaged fabric, she explained, ''It's a trade-off between the authentic material and the authentic look.''</p>
        <p>''It's an incredibly rare piece,'' said Ms. Schoelwer, ''one of perhaps three or four Tory uniform coats left around the country. Very few survived. After all, the children of Loyalists were not anxious to brag about it! Yet it's a very important piece in connecting with our history.''</p>
        <p>A 19th-century dress, blue cotton with tiny red and white flowers, provides its own history lesson. Although it is a simple, casual dress --  ''one that would never be exhibited as high fashion,'' Mrs. Schoelwer remarked -- the fact that rows of stitches were pulled out shows that the fabric was used more than once.</p>
        <p>''Textiles were very expensive and we learn from this dress that they were used over and over as fashions changed,'' Ms. Craughwell-Varda said. ''Moreover, the dress has something to tell us about Americans and sexuality: it's is in the empire style, but it is cut much higher than if it had been made for a European woman. And the fact that it has a drawstring under the bosom speaks to the frequent pregnancies of that era.''</p>
        <p>A more elegant garment is an embroidered waistcoat belonging to Jeremiah Wadsworth. Wadsworth, a patriot and friend to General George Washington, served as commissary general to American revolutionary forces and to French troops on this continent. He is said to have bought  the embroidered, ivory-colored silk fabric with its motif of birds and vines when he journeyed to France to report to the King after the war.</p>
        <p>Plans call for stabilizing damaged sections of the waistcoat while conserving as much of the original material as possible, and creating a pillow form to support the piece while in storage or on display.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is not simply to preserve these pieces as relics, but to enable them to be displayed -- under low lights, of course, and for maybe three months out of the year,'' said Ms. Schoelwer.</p>
        <p>Wadsworth's descendants, including his son Daniel, founder of the Wadsworth Atheneum, bequeathed to the historical society a treasure trove of clothing, family portraits, manuscripts and decorative pieces.  It is the presence of such complementary materials that makes the costume collection more valuable for researchers and scholars.</p>
        <p>Foremost among the textile items to be treated as part of the conservation project is a silk on silk needlework entitled ''The First, Second, and Last Scene of Mortality.'' Embroidered around 1783 by Prudence Punderson, a Preston resident then in her early 20's, the work, presumably a self-portrait, depicts a young woman engaged in drawing, flanked by a child in a cradle and a coffin bearing the artist's initials.</p>
        <p>''Its message of the three stages of life is unusual in the needlepoint girls did at that time,'' said Ms. Schoelwer. The piece is the most frequently reproduced item in the society's holdings, she related, appearing frequently in scholarly and popular studies as well as in American history textbooks.</p>
        <p>The artist, who died in childbirth about two years after completing the work, was the daughter of a Loyalist, and her affluent family donated many articles to the society, including the journal she kept, her wedding gown and the inkwell portrayed in her evocative needlework.</p>
        <p>''It is part of the first group of needlework pieces to be treated,'' said Ms. Schoelwer, adding that the work will be done by professional textile conservators in Lowell, Mass.  ''After the conservation work is done, it will be easier for us to exhibit it safely.''</p>
