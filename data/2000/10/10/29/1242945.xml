        <p>It has been half a year since the United States relaxed the 1987 embargo on Iranian carpets, caviar and pistachio nuts in what it called a goodwill gesture toward improved relations with Iran.

        <p>Iran's Caspian caviar was once revered as the finest, but no longer, said Bruce Sobol, co-owner of Caviarteria Inc. of New York, a leading importer and distributor of Caspian caviar: ''It's not markedly better than Russian, there's less of it, and it's more expensive.'' He is, however, receiving inquiries from customers eager to buy ''because it has been unavailable.''</p>

        <p>It has been half a year since the United States relaxed the 1987 embargo on Iranian carpets, caviar and pistachio nuts in what it called a goodwill gesture toward improved relations with Iran. But so far, only the carpets have had a renaissance in the American market -- which is good news for some people, bad for others.</p>
        <p>Iran's Caspian caviar was once revered as the finest, but no longer, said Bruce Sobol, co-owner of Caviarteria Inc. of New York, a leading importer and distributor of Caspian caviar: ''It's not markedly better than Russian, there's less of it, and it's more expensive.'' He is, however, receiving inquiries from customers eager to buy ''because it has been unavailable.''</p>
        <p>Iran's pistachio orchards, four times the size of California's, are not yet benefiting -- largely because the embargo is effectively still in place for them. A 1986 United States trade court ruling imposed tariffs of about 300 percent on Iranian pistachios because they had been sold below cost here. The Iranians are now appealing the ruling. Karen Reinecke, president of the California Pistachio Commission, said she was watching closely for the outcome. ''We want to make sure they just don't open the floodgates.''</p>
        <p>If there has been a flood, it has been in Iranian rugs. Shahriar Afshar, president of the Iranian Trade Association, an Iranian-American business group in San Diego, attributed that to long-established relationships with exporters in Iran. ''As soon as the embargo was lifted,'' he said, ''they had orders sitting on their desks waiting to go.'' And David Khazai, founder and chief executive of Edonia Inc. in Louisville, Ky., a distributor, said the Iranian currency, the rial, has made rugs a bargain. About 850 rials now equal a dollar, compared with 7 to the dollar when relations collapsed in 1979. He has 70,000 rugs arriving in the next few months. ''That's a lot of rugs,'' Mr. Khazai said.</p>
