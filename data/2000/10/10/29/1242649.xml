        <p>FOR the last 23 years, with the intensity of Newton contemplating the apple, the Prisoner Appreciation Society has pondered, debated and speculated on the properties of certain integers:</p>
        <p>Is No. 6 really No. 6?</p>
        <p>Is No. 2 really No. 2?</p>
        <p>Could No. 2 actually be No. 1?</p>
        <p>The Prisoner Appreciation Society is not the welcoming committee at San Quentin but rather the official fan club of ''The Prisoner,'' a British spy-fi series from the mid-1960's.</p>
        <p>'' 'The Prisoner' was the most radical and revolutionary drama series ever created for television,'' said Bruce Clark, who describes himself as the American coordinator of the society, which is based in Ipswich, England. ''Its enigmatic theme holds up so well that 34 years after its filming, some viewers are actually fooled into believing it's a current TV production.''</p>
        <p>''The Prisoner'' told the story of a secret agent who, after resigning his post, was abducted and held captive by powers unknown in a timeless hamlet called The Village. Everyone is under surveillance; no one has a name, only a number; and there is no knowing who is a friend and who is a stoolie.</p>
        <p>Conceived and co-written by Patrick McGoohan, who also played the lead role of No. 6, ''The Prisoner'' addressed such issues as the individual and society, the philosophical nature of freedom, the concentration and abuse of power, and the evils of blind progress. ''I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered!'' was the defiant mantra of No.  6. ''My life is my own!''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGoohan wadded Orwellian paranoia, Carrollian whimsy and Kafkaesque dread into 17 hourlong episodes:in one, characters are human chess pieces moving around a board; in another, the plot unfolds in a Paris of the protagonist's mind.</p>
        <p>While the surreal story line left more questions than it answered, the series' bewildering conclusion incited such outrage in England that Mr. McGoohan had to leave the country and lay low in Switzerland. ''I wanted to have controversy, fights, discussions, people in anger waving their fists in my face,'' he once said. ''Has one the right to be an individual? I wanted to make people talk about the series. I wanted them to ask questions, argue and think.''</p>
        <p>He succeeded. In the three decades since its debut, ''The Prisoner'' has become one of the most fanatically followed shows ever. The series has inspired more than a dozen books, more than two dozen Web sites and an Arizona State social-psychology course that no doubt addressed a question: Did McGoohan read McLuhan, or did McLuhan see McGoohan?</p>
        <p>A Hollywood remake, written by Christopher McQuarrie of ''The Usual Suspects'' fame, is scheduled to begin shooting next spring. And next week the A &amp; E network will release boxed sets of ''Prisoner'' DVD's and videos. The DVD set includes trailers, rare production stills and an even rarer 1977 television interview with the famously reticent Mr. McGoohan.</p>
        <p>The discs promise to be an invaluable resource for ''Prisoner'' cultists, who subject the show's footage to the same exhaustive frame-by-frame scrutiny that John F. Kennedy assassination-conspiracy buffs devote to the Zapruder film. ''In The Village,'' the Appreciation Society's glossy quarterly, devotes page after page to the significance of seemingly insignificant details.</p>
        <p>''Next to Zapruder's home movie, 'The Prisoner' must be about the most analyzed piece of film in history,'' said Mr. Clark, who wrote the liner notes for the DVD.</p>
        <p>Coordinator of the society's United States sector since 1983, Mr. Clark said dues-paying Appreciators number in the thousands. Many have made pilgrimages to the annual summer Prisoner Convention in Portmerion, the tiny Italianate dream town in North Wales that was the setting for The Village. Middle-aged ''Prisoner'' hadjiis re-enact scenes from the show, paw over its ambiguities and cavort as Villagers in piped blazers, straw boaters and flowing capes.</p>
        <p>Instead of name tags, most conventioneers sport buttons bearing their numbers. Mr. Clark savors the irony. ''It's certainly a paradox that people who believe strongly in The Individual dress up as someone else,'' he said. ''But they're free to appreciate 'The Prisoner' any way they see fit, and any  costume at our convention adds to the festive atmosphere of The Village.''</p>
        <p>Cult friction led to the cancellation of last year's ''Prisoner'' meeting. After a couple of statues were vandalized at the 1998 convention, trustees of Portmerion banned the event. Happily, Mr. Clark reports, the town fathers have reconsidered. Sort of. ''They've given us permission to hold a convention next March,'' he said. At the height of the resort town's off-season.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark seemed slightly out of character when he appeared at the door of his split-level home in (where else?) North Wales, Pa. He was somewhat disappointingly garbed in jeans and a teal T-shirt that read: ''Pinball, Fit for a King.''</p>
        <p>It's there, in a suburban outpost of the village of Philadelphia, that this former insurance underwriter makes a living by selling refrigerator magnets that depict historical markers.</p>
        <p>''Pennsylvania has markers commemorating Johnny Appleseed, Tom Mix and the first drive-in filling station,'' Mr. Clark said. He plucked a magnetized No. 6 badge off his General Electric and added: ''If fridges ever go to plastic, I'm in big trouble.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark began Appreciating as 15-year-old in Northeast Philadelphia. ''I'd been a big admirer of 'Secret Agent,' McGoohan's previous series,'' he said. When he heard that ''The Prisoner'' would have its premiere on CBS, he went next door to watch it on his neighbor's color television set. ''The show blew me away,'' he recalled. ''Of course, at that age I didn't see the symbolism or understand the allegory or realize it was all about being an individual.''</p>
        <p>Now, of course, he does. Mr. Clark has attended 3 of the society's 21 summer synods and watched some episodes as many as 50 times. ''But I'm not a fanatic,'' he said flatly. ''I don't own a piped blazer or a boater or -- the ultimate 'Prisoner' collectible -- a Lotus 7, Series II,'' a sporty British convertible. (Another Pennsylvania motorist beat Mr. Clark to the car's license plate number used in the show, KAR 120C.)</p>
        <p>He does, however, own two Lava Lamps, the stylish 60's accessory that ''The Prisoner'' helped popularize. ''There were two different color models seen in No. 6's Village apartment and a huge double-decker one in  No. 2's,'' he said with the know-it-all earnestness of a ''Jeopardy'' contestant. ''Lava Lamps appeared in all but three episodes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark knows this because he wrote an essay on the subject for that clearinghouse of Prisoneriana, ''In The Village.'' Topics in recent issues run from ''No. 6: Monk or Mystic?'' to ''The Prisoner, Adolf Hitler and a Breakdown of the Time-Space Continuum.''</p>
        <p>The cult of ''The Prisoner'' extends to the cult of Mr. McGoohan, whose refusal to give interviews only fuels his mystery. Appreciators tend to speak of the 72-year-old actor in hushed, reverential tones, scattering the words ''daring visionary'' before his name like rose petals the way that the name Manuel Noriega was preceded by the descriptive ''Panamanian strongman.'' Even his faxed thank you notes are treated as if they were splinters from the true cross. ''Mr. McGoohan is a very private person,'' said Mr. Clark, who has never met him. ''We respect his privacy.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, ''Prisoner'' faithful have been known to observe Mr. McGoohan's stage performances through binoculars, like birders stalking the bright-rumped attila. He did not seem especially appreciative when a herd of Appreciators showed up in Boston for a 1985 production of ''Pack of Lies'' and whistled the Episode 1 jingle, ''Pop Goes The Weasel,'' during intermission. They were tossed out of the theater.</p>
        <p>Forever pestered by cultists seeking answers to ''Prisoner'' riddles, the society's ''honorary president'' seems to regard the organization with something approaching disdain. ''Some of our British members take the show far too seriously,'' Mr. Clark allowed.</p>
        <p>The most serious British Appreciator is surely Max Hora. Author of three scrupulously researched ''Prisoner'' tracts, Mr. Hora showed his devotion to the cause in 1982 by moving to Portmerion and opening the Prisoner Shop and Information Center in No. 6's old cottage.</p>
        <p>''For 17 years, Max lived in The Village,'' Mr. Clark said. ''He sold guides, stickers, pens, postcards and maps, signed up new members and answered questions about the series. He was a kind of prisoner of 'The Prisoner' until he finally moved out.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps he got paroled.</p>
