        <p>MARTHA PEAKE</p>
        <p>A Novel of the Revolution.</p>
        <p>By Patrick McGrath.</p>
        <p>367 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $ 24.95.</p>
        <p>A young man named Ambrose is summoned by his dying Uncle William to an ancient pile called Drogo Hall, there to hear the story that the uncle, with the last of his strength, is driven to tell. It is the story of Harry Peake -- smuggler, poet, freak, madman, tormented soul -- and of his splendid red-haired daughter, Martha, who emigrates to America and becomes an early martyr of the Revolution. But Uncle William is erratic in his delivery and wandering in his mind, often confused by drink and -- the nephew suspects -- opium. Quite often too he conceals things or deliberately misleads. So it is Ambrose who by means of sympathy, imagination, intuition, must fashion a coherent account. This tentative, speculative narrative enterprise forms the stuff of Patrick McGrath's latest novel.</p>
        <p>Ambrose's visit takes place in the early part of the 19th century. The year is not given to us, but by internal evidence it seems to be around 1820 -- the full flush of Romanticism. However, Uncle William's story goes back to the middle years of the previous century, a very different age, the dawn of the Gothic, with its prevailing atmosphere of mystery and terror. This conjunction of period and outlook makes ''Martha Peake'' a novel unusual in its method and unsettling in its focus. It is unusual because of the total reliance on pastiche. Ambrose's is not a voice from within the action: he is relating events in which he has had no part. However, he is as far from an impersonal narrator as it is possible to be. Though quite unacquainted with either Harry or Martha, he soon becomes deeply, feverishly (and not always very plausibly) involved in their story. And he is given a prose style at once stately and fervid, appropriate for+a contemporary of Coleridge and Scott. The novel is also unsettling because in addition to the shifty and unreliable uncle and the emotional and exclamatory nephew, there is, of course, a third narrator at work, one who lives with us, heir to the cataclysms of the 20th century -- to say nothing of three centuries of fiction. He it is who has chosen to simulate the mannered ampleness of a former age.</p>
        <p>Whether we find this borrowed style effective must largely depend on how far we can accept the artifice and how seriously we can take the Gothic trappings -- for the trappings and the language go very closely together, the one seeking to validate the other. Drogo Hall is a splendid example of the decaying and sinister Gothic mansion, set in the midst of noxious marshland, adjoining an abandoned graveyard, a labyrinth of noisome passages, concealed entrances, dead ends, trapdoors, complete with a chamber of horrors below ground and ghostly footfalls in the night. Then there is the London of the 1760's, seen as a decaying and sinister Gothic mansion on a larger scale, pervaded by mist and blight, with disease, depravity and horror lurking in every alley.</p>
        <p>Harry Peake's story, in its violence and horror, fits well into this background. In an accident brought about by his drunkenness and negligence, his adored wife has been burned to death and he himself terribly injured -- his spine, fractured in several places, has mended crookedly, twisting his body and leaving him with a ridged superstructure of bone on his back like a monstrous hump. This hideous deformity also distorts his life, driving+him to extremes of self-debasement and near-sainthood as well as alcoholism and brutal crime. It is here, in the account of Harry's wanderings through London's docklands with his daughter, that the true heart of the novel lies, characterized by remarkable passages of sustained dramatic and atmospheric writing in which the mannered exaggerations of the style are entirely appropriate to the excesses and grotesqueries, physical and spiritual, that are being related. Scenes like that in which Harry (who has taken to exhibiting his deformity for money in East End drinking dens, at the same time reciting his revolutionary poetry) is visited by Lord Drogo, the celebrated anatomist, who has a professional interest in his spine, have a somber magnificence and power that make them compelling to read.</p>
        <p>There is not much in the way of reasoning on the part of the characters. McGrath is true to the period in this: it was a time when antirational elements prevailed in intellectual life and the aim of the author was to arouse the emotions and fire the imagination with scenes terrifying or wonderful. Harry moves through life at the prompting of his tormented soul, through turmoil and travail, revulsion, rage, remorse, expiation, exhausted peace. He never stops to think, to analyze, to count the cost -- and in this too he is a kind of monster. With psychology so notably absent, it is natural to look for symbol. Is Harry Peake, in his deformity and corrupted nature, somehow representative of the Old World in travail? Is Martha, in her unswerving loyalty, her passionate spirit and frank sexuality, meant to symbolize the energies of the new nation she adopts? There are scattered hints to this effect, yet nowhere is it sufficiently realized to form a significant element of the book.</p>
        <p>But the main problem comes midway, with the disappearance of Harry from center stage and the departure of Martha for America. Given the charged atmosphere of the earlier pages and the intensity of the relationship between father and daughter, this delivers a blow to the structure of the novel from which it never really recovers. True, there has sometimes been strain in the first half, with the language clutching for hyperbole -- a notable sign of this being the overfrequent use of the word ''great'' in its meaning of splendid or magnificent or deeply impressive. It is not unusual to find it used two or three times in the same paragraph. It is applied to a whole range of things, from Martha's hair to her father-in-law's chair, but mainly it is used in reference to Harry, his head or his face or his back or -- twice, memorably, in identical terms -- to his phenomenal male member. No good putting the blame for this on Ambrose's excited fancy. An overworked epithet remains just that, whatever the period; and such explicitness doesn't belong in the period anyway. All the same, while Harry is at the center of the action, we are carried along by the eloquence and the energy and the brilliantly managed narrative pace. It is not that his daughter has an uneventful time in the New World -- far from it -- but by then ''Martha Peake'' has become a different sort of story: more open, more episodic, breezier. The pace is broken by the frequent need to hark back to England, to dwell for a while on the horrors of Drogo Hall, the presumed villainy of Lord Drogo, the increasingly unconfident speculations of Ambrose, who has never set foot in America (or, for that matter, set eyes on Martha) and has only some scraps of letters, almost illegible, to go on.</p>
        <p>As the novel draws to a close, the threads begin to come together. Things are by no means what they have seemed. It has all been an ingenious game, a careful accumulation of false impressions. Cunning use has been made of the uncle's evasiveness, the nephew's impetuous imagination. But in this kind of game, where the reader is softened up, so to speak, with erroneous suppositions, so as to be ready for the impact of truth, that truth must be delivered. And it must carry conviction. Kafka hasn't appeared on the scene yet; we are with Ambrose in the early 19th century; we can't be left in the dark. Certainly, some obscure corners are lit up, but the mystification has lasted so long and been so cleverly maintained that the final revelation seems too scrambled and brief.</p>
        <p>''Martha Peake'' is an uneven novel, but it has rare qualities of power and urgency. I know that my imagination will be haunted for quite some time by the twisted figure of Harry Peake and the monstrous shadow of that great . . . hump.</p>
