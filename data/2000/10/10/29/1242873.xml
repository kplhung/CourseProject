      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Oct. 15 about hyperrealistic painting misspelled the name of the gallery that represents the artist Alexis Rockman. It is Gorney, Bravin &amp; Lee, not Braven.</p>
        <p>A picture of a Rockman painting with the article carried an erroneous credit from a publicity agency. (The error also occurred on Sept. 12, when the photograph appeared in Science Times with an article about genetics and art.) The photographer was Oren Slor, and the photograph was provided by Gorney, Bravin &amp; Lee.</p>
