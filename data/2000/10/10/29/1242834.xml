        <p>AFTER seven years and an outlay $3.4 million, the maritime art of John A. Noble (1913-1983) has a new home. The Noble Maritime Collection will open to the public next Sunday in a former residence for retired mariners that was built in 1844 at Sailors' Snug Harbor. It now has gallery and studio space, a library and archives. Mr. Noble was a lithographer who chronicled the last chapter of the Age of Sail. Shown above is ''Cape Horner,'' a rendering of the Occidental, built in Bath, Me., in 1874. Mr. Noble drew the ship in 1950, after it was abandoned off Bayonne, N.J., where he kept his studio. ''She has preserved her shape perfectly,'' Mr. Noble wrote in 1955.</p>
