        <p>By Kit Reed.</p>
        <p>302 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Forge/Tom Doherty</p>
        <p>Associates. $22.95.</p>
        <p>If Eleanor Rigby and Father McKenzie both had America Online accounts, they'd probably feel right at home with all the other lonely people in ''@expectations,'' Kit Reed's poignant new novel about love, life and loss in the age of the Internet.</p>
        <p>Reed's heroine, a newlywed named Jenny Wilder, is trapped in an unfamiliar Southern town with her Marine husband, Charlie, who's never home, and two young stepchildren, who hate her. Bored out of her mind, she learns to cope by thinking outside the box -- or, in this case, by climbing inside the box and discovering an exciting haven in an interactive computer game.</p>
        <p>The game that Jenny finds, a text-based adventure set on an island paradise called StElene, is what's known as a MUD, or multi-user domain/dungeon/dimension. Generally speaking, a MUD is an online version of a role-playing game, a cyberspace counterpart to dungeons and dragons. On StElene, each player creates a character that can be controlled as he or she moves about the electronic realm.</p>
        <p>Inside the game, Jenny meets players from around the world -- or, rather, their virtual alter egos. She becomes a friend to Lark (a k a Hubert Pinkney), a psychotically shy college dropout, and an enemy of Mireya (in the virtual world, a statuesque beauty; in reality, a bitter little woman named Florence Vito Watson). And both Jenny and her online character, Zan, fall mouse over modem in love with Reverdy, the alias of a smooth-talking programming whiz from Alaska who follows the credo ''you are what you type.'' The act of trying to balance two men, neither of whom is completely present in all aspects of her life, takes up the bulk of the book as Jenny veers in and out of her two worlds and blurs the line between them. ''I love two men and I need them both,'' she explains. ''Charlie's warmth, Reverdy's soul.''</p>
        <p>A novel about a bunch of social misfits sitting around typing would seem to have little appeal, but Reed neatly sidesteps stagnation in a number of ways. By making her characters play a text-based game in which the reader absorbs the descriptions of the cyberworld (''You are in a light, bright library, the outer chamber of the sphere where Lark lives and works'') at the same time as the character does, she draws readers into the story more deeply than if everyone were simply sitting around pointing and clicking through a more visually oriented game. ''Have you ever gotten lost in a book?'' Jenny asks as she tries to explain her fascination with her virtual world. ''So deep in the story that it's the only thing that matters and the world outside seems like the dream?''</p>
        <p>Reed also does quite a bit of change-up in the tone of the narration. Each chapter in ''@expectations'' is told from the point of view of a different character (or that character's online character), thus creating enough tension between the ''virtual'' and ''real'' worlds to provide the torque that rotates the plot. Simply reading about an online romance can be pretty boring, but Reed solves this problem by sharing the participants' perceptions of romance as they experience them.</p>
        <p>Even though there's heavy foreshadowing that Jenny's digital dream date isn't quite what she thinks (his online bio reads, ''Reverdy is not what he seems''), the book proceeds at a fairly even pace until the end, where it suddenly lurches into a flurry of action. While the shifts in movement and character motivation seem a little weak in some places, Reed manages to make a success of ''@expectations'' by zeroing in on that fascinating feeling one can get when leaving a mundane life to recreate the self in an alternative reality. As she amply demonstrates, emotions in the virtual world can be just as genuine as any others.</p>
        <p>''StElene is like going to live in a book,'' Jenny proclaims in a nice bit of irony. ''It's the one place where I'm in complete control of my life. I can be in love and make my own story and write any ending I want!'' And in the end, despite the bumpy ride as the book winds down, you find yourself hanging on until the very last page, eager to see if she can do just that.</p>
