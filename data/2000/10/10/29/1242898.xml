        <p>Pupils at Public School 3, a highly rated  progressive elementary school in the West Village, received a lesson on grown-up politics last week as parents and teachers demanded answers about the sudden firing of the interim principal.</p>
        <p>Following two protests and many queries from angry parents, the acting superintendent of District 2, Shelley Harwayne, sought to allay concerns about her unilateral decision to fire Kate Unger just two months into her job.</p>
        <p>''I removed her because she was not an instructional leader,'' Ms. Harwayne said Thursday at a raucous meeting in the auditorium of the school, at 490 Hudson Street, attended by more than 120 parents and local officials. ''I have no sense of standardizing what goes on here. I'm an advocate of schools like this.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Harwayne also painted an unflattering picture of Ms. Unger, saying she could not articulate a vision and had a poor grasp of basic educational tools. ''The gap was so great,'' said Ms. Harwayne, who had hired Ms. Unger originally.</p>
        <p>Ms. Unger, 49, a doctoral candidate at Teachers College, Columbia University, and a former high school principal in Maryland, said her credentials speak for themselves. ''If I'm not an instructional leader for P.S. 3 in Greenwich Village,'' she said in an interview, ''then what does that say about Teachers College at Columbia University?''</p>
        <p>Some parents and teachers interpreted the words ''instructional leader'' as a euphemism for someone who could turn their school into another District 2 ''cookie cutter'' institution.</p>
        <p>''Kate's beliefs stand in sharp contrast to the district's hierarchical, increasingly autocratic stance towards parents and teachers,'' said Lois Weiner, the parent of a fifth grader and an associate professor at New Jersey City University in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>Parents noted that District 2 now requires third graders to prepare for standardized tests and has tried to replace individualized student evaluations with a grading system.</p>
        <p>Thursday's meeting also revealed a rift among parents and teachers, with some participants supporting the superintendent's action and others accusing some parents and teachers of political grandstanding. But most parents and teachers agreed that the firing should have been handled differently and that the superintendent should have consulted them first.</p>
        <p>Liz Saplin, who on Monday became the school's fourth principal in four years, attended the meeting but did not address the audience.</p>
        <p>''Even with all the turmoil, our kids have managed to get good grades,'' said Lynn Liota, the parent of an 8-year-old. ''The transient principals cannot assume the credit. The kids, teachers and parents deserve that.''</p>
