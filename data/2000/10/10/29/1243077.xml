        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I have a 15-year-old son. He grew up worshipping baseball. He listened to or watched every Twins game. He started playing baseball in first grade and still plays to this day. Last night he was home sick on the couch. I was out and called to check on him. He said, ''Baseball is so boring now I am actually watching the debate instead of the Yankees game.''</p>

        <p>You all may be excited about the World Series in New York, but the rest of the country is sick of being farm teams for the top few teams. The sport is dying. I hope the low ratings can bring about a change to bring the rest of the country back in.</p>
