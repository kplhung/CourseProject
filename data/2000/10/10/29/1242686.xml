        <p>ANGELIQUE XOCHIME IRVIN did not have to look far for a site for her fledgling software development company when it came time for her to receive her M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School last May.</p>
        <p>Ms. Irvin, a 34-year-old entrepreneur, decided to stay in the neighborhood. Her choice for a business home is a new building in the 17-acre University City Science Center research park in West Philadelphia, adjacent to both Penn and Drexel University. The $22 million building -- named the Port of Technology -- at 37th and Market streets offered Ms. Irvin exactly the kind of high-tech amenities she wanted.</p>
        <p>And Ms. Irvin was exactly the kind of so-called ''new economy'' tenant the Science Center envisioned when it decided to put up the city's first speculative office building since 1992.</p>
        <p>''Philadelphia is trying to hold on to its brain power,'' said Roger McManimon, a director in the Philadelphia office of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the real estate services company. ''We don't want them going to California or Boston.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Boston's booming real-estate market, Philadelphia stalled during the 1990's as major businesses, including the CoreStates Financial Corporation and Conrail Inc., were swallowed up or dismantled. Such losses dumped hundreds of thousands of square feet on the market. While rental rates in Boston are now as high as $85 a square foot a year, according to Mark Roth, senior director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield's Boston office, the rate for top tier buildings in Philadelphia is $32.50 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''Basically, we've climbed back up to where we were in the mid- to late-1980's,'' said Paul G. Garvey, senior director of Cushman's Philadelphia office.</p>
        <p>But the city is rebounding, as evidenced by the leasing activity at the Port of Technology, Mr. Garvey said. The building was 90 percent leased by the time construction was completed in July.</p>
        <p>What attracted Ms. Irvin was the building's incubator program. It provides her company, Coviant Inc., which develops software for the fiber-optics market, with access to capital, business contacts and mentoring services. A self-described ''techie nerd,'' Ms. Irvin said she was also impressed with the building's access to ''the latest and greatest in fiber to the desktop.''</p>
        <p>Like many landlords today, the Science Center wants to showcase the fiber in its walls, not its carpet. Real estate agents now pitch buildings as having ''robust riser cores,'' which mean they have large raceways to carry wiring. The brochure phrase ''plug and play,'' is to let tenants know they can be in the game merely by showing up with phones and computers.</p>
        <p>To create a smart building, the Science Center enlisted the help of Cisco Systems Inc. of San Jose, Calif. The Port of Technology was built with enough ''dark'' -- unused -- fiber-optic cable to handle the hungriest bandwidth users, like multimedia Internet broadcasting companies. Bandwidth determines how much data can be sent and received at any time. The building also houses a ''co-location provider,'' Meridian Telesis L.L.C., where internet-based and telecommunications businesses can lease space for their computers and fiber optic cable equipment. These centers, also known as ''carrier hotels,'' ''server farms'' and ''cyber centers'' offer customers around-the-clock security, environmental controls and protection against power failure for their communications equipment.</p>
        <p>The 144,000-square-foot, eight-story building was outfitted with cutting-edge telephony -- voice-over-I.P. (Internet protocol) --  so tenants can run voice calls on a data network. It is more cost-effective and easier to manage than traditional switch-based telephone networks.</p>
        <p>The project's architects, Ueland, Junker, McCauley &amp; Nicholson of Philadelphia, designed the building with dual power service and space for emergency generators.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't do what I'm doing competitively in another building,'' said Ms. Irvin.  And she can also take her 13-year-old Norwegian elkhound, Brokk, to the office.</p>
        <p>The Science Center's campus is run by a nonprofit organization made up of 30 academic and scientific institutions interested in creating regional wealth. The campus is one of the nation's largest urban research parks, running from 34th to 38th Streets along Market Street. It houses nearly 200 technology and science-related operations that employ nearly 7,000 people.</p>
        <p>When it was founded in 1963, the Science Center was one of the first city research campuses in the world. It grew out of a larger initiative spearheaded in the late 1950's by the University of Pennsylvania under Gaylord P. Harnwell, who was its president at the time. The project was an attempt by academic and medical communities to revitalize declining West Philadelphia neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>IN the 19th century, the section of West Philadelphia overlooking the Schuylkill that includes the university was home to some of Philadelphia's best families. But by the early 1900's, smokestacks were the backdrop for some photos of Penn buildings.</p>
        <p>In 1920, the university considered a proposal to move 22 miles west to a 175-acre estate near Valley Forge National Historical Park, according to a university history co-authored by Martin Meyerson, president emeritus of Penn.</p>
        <p>After decades of discussion, trustees decided in the 1950's that the university had an important role to play in revitalizing the neighborhood. But urban renewal plans soon angered residents. The Science Center project meant that hundreds of buildings would be demolished and more than 1,000 people displaced. Students took up the cause in 1969, staging a sit-in at Penn's College Hall, where the university's administrative offices are located, to protest displacement of black residents. They also wanted a halt to military research at the park.</p>
        <p>But for young people involved with the Science Center now, that is ancient history.</p>
        <p>''It was a different time -- an anti-establishment time,'' said Gregg W. Garnick, 36, executive director of the incubator program.</p>
        <p>Today, under the leadership of Jill R. Felix, the Science Center appears to be living up to the dream of its creators. The center plans to expand to 3.6 million square feet from 2 million square feet in the next decade. The master plan calls for the number of buildings to grow to 18 from the current 14. Each new building site is a Keystone Opportunity Zone, where nearly all city and state taxes are waived until December 2010.</p>
        <p>Ms. Felix, who developed the Great Valley Corporate Center in Malvern, Pa., while with Liberty Property Trust (formerly Rouse &amp; Associates), believes the Science Center has a competitive edge because there are 100,000 professors, students and other professionals within walking distance of the park. ''In today's world, the biggest challenge is attracting and retaining people,'' Ms. Felix said.</p>
        <p>The City of Philadelphia supported the campus's recent expansion by giving $1 million for Port of Technology's technology infrastructure. Townsend Capital L.L.C., a private real estate investment firm based in Towson, Md., is a partner in the building, mainly providing some financing.</p>
        <p>Two of the building's floors have been designated as incubator space. One entire floor is equipped with wet labs, reinforced floors and vent stacks for early-stage life sciences companies. The other, where Ms. Irvin has her company, is for information technology start-ups. It consists of one huge open room with ultramodern modular furniture, giving the appearance of one company, even though there are in fact several startups there.</p>
        <p>The other six floors are being leased to more-established technology companies at $23 a square foot a year. CTNY of New York City, which develops software to allow businesses to gain access to data by wireless technologies, took a full floor.</p>
        <p>Fledgling companies like Ms. Irvin's Coviant, which has five full-time employees and 10 workers on a contract basis, have to be approved by Port of Technology Inc., a for-profit subsidiary of the Science Center.</p>
        <p>Instead of paying rent, the tenants pay a monthly fee of $450 per workstation. In return, they are given access to office equipment, a break room, conference rooms and an on-site support team that includes a lawyer. The incubator companies give the Science Center a 5 percent equity stake in their businesses.</p>
        <p>Twenty information technology and biotechnology companies are in the incubator program. The Science Center has another subsidiary raising a pool of $60 million to invest in tenant companies in amounts of $500,000 to $1 million.</p>
        <p>''The lure of the building is that it's an urban location, close to public transportation,'' said James Venturi, chief executive of CTNY. ''We didn't want to be in a suburban park -- for our culture, it's not an option.''</p>
