        <p>For the first time in more than half a century of dealing with issues of war and peace, the United Nations Security devoted a special session to women, who are demanding to be included at the negotiating table in many regions, most prominently in Africa.</p>
        <p>Angela King, an assistant secretary general and special adviser to the secretary general on the advancement of women, said women can readily expand debates to include social issues at a time when global conflict is harming more civilians than soldiers. Women should also play a bigger role in peacekeeping missions, she added. ''Gender equality issues are absolutely essential to the success of any peace operation,'' Ms. King said.</p>
