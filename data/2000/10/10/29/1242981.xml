        <p>A rival baseball executive called Brian Cashman in the middle of June, and he could tell by the hurried pace of Cashman's voice that the Yankees' general manager was very, very busy. ''He's got a lot of stuff going on,'' the executive said.</p>
        <p>What Cashman was doing was filling holes, retooling, revamping, because it had become apparent that the Yankees needed changes. In staff meetings in spring training, there had been some concern about the team's bench, about whether a veteran catcher was needed to back up Jorge Posada, and about the organization's pitching depth. But the wide consensus was that the Yankees, as they were composed on opening day, were good enough to win the World Series again.</p>
        <p>''We felt pretty good about everything,'' a Yankees executive said about those days, months before the Yankees actually did win the World Series again, defeating the Mets in five games. ''We talked about some things, like Jim Edmonds. But we were good enough, and we didn't want to touch the farm system unless we had to.''</p>
        <p>But holes began appearing immediately. Left fielder Ricky Ledee batted .173 in April, and David Cone -- a pitcher Cashman and others persuaded George Steinbrenner to re-sign for one year and $12 million -- was knocked around in his first five starts. The Yankees went 15-8, but internally, there was already some concern about the quality of the reserves, and the offense was stagnant.</p>
        <p>The Yankees lost five games in a row from May 11-16 and then dropped two of three in Cleveland. Steinbrenner was furious and harped on the fact that the team had not traded for Edmonds, who was swapped to St. Louis and bloomed; the owner wanted action. But club executives persuaded him to wait a little longer, to see if Ledee would come out of his funk.</p>
        <p>But Ledee, his confidence decimated, sometimes went online to see what fans were writing about him in the chat room of the Yankees' Web site; he was upset when fans at Yankee Stadium berated him. His slump deepened. Sammy Sosa was available, and the Tigers were willing to listen to offers for Juan Gonzalez. The Chicago White Sox went into Yankee Stadium and swept four games June 15-18, by a combined score of 42-17. Steinbrenner pushed for action, and Cashman, convinced that the offense needed to be augmented, increased the pace of his negotiations.</p>
        <p>A more pressing need arose. Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch's dormant throwing jitters erupted June 15, when he made three errors and was told to go home by Manager Joe Torre. Cashman had had conversations with the Dodgers' general manager, Kevin Malone, about a spare part named Jose Vizcaino, and after Knoblauch's status became uncertain, Cashman moved, swapping Jim Leyritz for Vizcaino on June 20. Vizcaino batted .338 in his first 26 games, a trend that continued throughout the summer for the Yankees: every acquisition seemed to make an immediate contribution.</p>
        <p>The next day, Cashman made a bigger deal, arranging a trade with Detroit for Gonzalez, conditional on Gonzalez's approval, and after four days the Yankees could not reach an agreement on a contract extension, killing the trade. Steinbrenner turned his attention toward Sosa, the aging, dynamic and defensively limited star of the Cubs. The majority of Steinbrenner's advisers did not want Sosa, feeling it would cost too much in prospects to trade for him and too much money to sign him to an extension. They wanted to come up with a suitable alternative too, and fast; the Yankees were 37-33, and in second place.</p>
        <p>On June 27, Cashman called Mark Shapiro, a Cleveland executive, to ask how he could ship a 1999 championship ring to Gary Tuck, a former Yankees official who was hired by the Indians for this season. As they talked, Shapiro mentioned that outfielder David Justice was available and asked if the Yankees might be interested.</p>
        <p>Two days later, Cashman traded Ledee and two young pitchers to be named for Justice, who has two years and $14 million remaining on his contract. Justice completely regenerated the Yankees' offense, the run production increasing by about 20 percent before the team's late-season slump. ''He came in and was every bit what we needed at that point,'' Torre said. ''A remarkable gift from Brian Cashman.''</p>
        <p>Cone had not won a game in two months by then, and the Yankees' staff had no idea whether he would rebound. Roger Clemens was on the disabled list, Orlando Hernandez was complaining of elbow trouble, and the Yankees were giving starts to Class AAA pitchers like Jake Westbrook and Ben Ford, and the youngsters were getting clobbered.</p>
        <p>The Yankees needed a starting pitcher. Cashman called the Philadelphia Phillies and was told that Curt Schilling was not available. But June 30, the Cincinnati general manager, Jim Bowden, called Cashman and said he might be ready to trade Denny Neagle, but he wanted it kept quiet.</p>
        <p>Cashman and Bowden talked over the next 12 days, the Reds falling farther from first place, and on July 12 they settled on a deal -- Neagle for several top prospects, including the highly touted Drew Henson, a third baseman. Neagle struggled at season's end, but he was extremely important when he was first acquired, stabilizing the Yankees' rotation. ''The biggest thing I think that he did was allow Roger and Pettitte to work every fifth day,'' Posada, the catcher, said, referring to Clemens and Andy Pettitte, workhorses who greatly prefer a regular routine. ''The rotation was solid again.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner forced club officials to sign Dwight Gooden, and Gooden stunned the staff with his effectiveness after his promotion to the majors on July 8. But outfielder Shane Spencer blew out his knee on July 9, and Cashman was back in the market for a hitter, a right-handed slugger.</p>
        <p>He preferred Ron Coomer, the Minnesota infielder. Steinbrenner wanted Glenallen Hill, a Cubs reserve who was represented by Steinbrenner's friend, the agent Tom Reich, and on July 21, the Yankees dealt for Hill -- who provided offense immediately, crushing 10 homers in his first 51 at-bats with the team.</p>
        <p>Cashman kept trying to add more before the trade deadline and twice came close to making deals: first, a three-way deal for Milwaukee outfielder Jeromy Burnitz, a proposal that fell apart when the Montreal Expos' Rondell White flunked the Brewers' physical examination; and second, a three-way deal with San Diego and Baltimore that would have netted the Yankees B. J. Surhoff, an outfielder, Matt Clement, a pitcher,  and a couple of other players.</p>
        <p>But nothing fell into place, and, after the trade deadline, Cashman made a series of smaller moves to help the bench: outfielder Luis Polonia was signed Aug. 3, after he had been released by the Tigers; the slugger Jose Canseco was claimed on waivers from Tampa Bay on Aug. 7, a mistake that annoyed Torre at first; and a minor league pitcher was traded to Pittsburgh for Luis Sojo.</p>
        <p>As with all the deals, the Sojo trade turned out to be both lucky and good. The Yankees had allowed Sojo to leave after the 1999 season, expecting D'Angelo Jimenez to take over his utility role. But shortly after Sojo signed with Pittsburgh, Jimenez was seriously injured in a car accident, and Cashman tried and failed repeatedly to reacquire Sojo.</p>
        <p>By the time Pittsburgh was finally ready to deal Sojo, he already had regular playing time with the Pirates and, as a result, was hitting much better than he had for the Yankees in '98 and '99. It would be Sojo who would drive in the winning run in the World Series, but all of Cashman's cavalry had helped.</p>
