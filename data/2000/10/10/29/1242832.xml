        <p>ARE everyday interactions between races in the city, particularly blacks and whites, too often tainted by hostility and stereotyping on both sides?</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, this column presented a few egregious examples of how some white New Yorkers presume that their black and brown neighbors work rather than live in their buildings.</p>
        <p>The column described a stereotyping experienced by otherwise privileged people. A black woman using her building's laundry room who is presumed to be a housekeeper and a black executive whose neighbor asks if he is delivering groceries, for instance.</p>
        <p>Many white readers responded to those examples with sympathy. They said they understood the humiliation and anger of not being seen for who you really are.</p>
        <p>However, some white readers said they too experience racism, again of the variety that does not make headlines.</p>
        <p>One white woman said a black person had screamed at her on the subway because she brushed against her and did say ''excuse me'' quickly enough.</p>
        <p>A white teacher said she was concerned that much black anger seemed to come from two myths. One is that all whites are prosperous. The other is that prosperous whites often view blacks with contempt. The woman said even she has been mistaken for a nanny rather than a teacher and insisted that such mistakes are not always racial.</p>
        <p>''White people don't hate black people,'' said one letter writer. ''They're afraid of them because they feel and experience their hate and hostility. Black people truly hate white people, and it seems they have a hard time not showing it.''</p>
        <p>The writer, a New York resident for 15 years, said she recently attended a dinner party at which the white guests recounted episodes of black hostility.</p>
        <p>Pain is pain, but black racial hostility and white racial hostility are not the same. Black hostility tends to be rooted in fear, frustration and pain over continued and past discrimination. White racism tends to be rooted in feelings of superiority that are part of a larger institutional racism. It doesn't make either right, but there it is.</p>
        <p>Because New Yorkers are always interacting with strangers, we are constantly cast into ill-fitting roles. Blacks assume white racism and whites assume black anger. In the absence of tragedies like Crown Heights or the Amadou Diallo shooting, we obsessively monitor the small things.</p>
        <p>Wonderful examples of interracial harmony exist. But in the places where casual, anonymous interactions occur, the subway and lines for movies and A.T.M.'s, negative body language communicates racial paranoia. The hunched shoulders, the shrugs, the rolled eyes do real damage.</p>
        <p>Black customers in a store exchange looks because a white clerk takes a tad too long to wait on them. White subway riders grimace when a group of noisy black teenagers enters a car. Black riders shake their heads, at the teenagers and at the grimacing whites.</p>
        <p>In a conversation, a white woman talked about hesitating before getting on an elevator with a group of young black men, not because they were black, she said, but because she would have been the only woman. Not wanting to appear racist, she entered the elevator and hugged a corner. The woman said the young men puffed out their chests and spread their legs wide to intimidate her.</p>
        <p>What came first? Their animosity or her discomfort? One can assume that the young men have often had the experience of being feared by white people.</p>
        <p>''I think black and white people rarely look each other in the eye,'' suggested Maurice Berger, a cultural critic who writes frequently about race and the author of ''White Lies: Race and the Myths of Whiteness'' (Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux, 1999). ''It's this dueling set of glances and gestures that sets up this hostility in public.''</p>
        <p>''It's hard for white people to empathize with what it feels like to be a minority in this society,'' Mr. Berger said. ''It sets up a vicious cycle of white ignorance of wholesale racism and black wariness and distrust.''</p>
        <p>A white social worker said in a conversation that it irritated him that all whites are presumed to harbor racial animosity every time they accidentally stub a black toe, as once happened to him. ''We don't have separate drinking fountains anymore,'' the man said. ''I shouldn't be held responsible.''</p>
        <p>History, though, cannot be denied, asserted Jane Lazarre, who teaches writing at the New School University. The author of ''Beyond the Whiteness of Whiteness: Memoir of a White Mother of Black Sons'' (Duke University, 1996), she too has been the object of racist name-calling by blacks who do not know her or her family.</p>
        <p>''Of course I feel personally offended, but you have to understand the history,'' Ms. Lazarre said, pointing to black disfranchisement and white denial of the past and continued racism.</p>
        <p>''White people are offended that they are not looked at as individuals but as a group. Black people live with that all the time.''</p>
        <p>''It's not that it's right, but it's the history,'' she said. ''It's that wonderful line from James Baldwin: 'People are trapped in history, and history is trapped in them.' ''</p>
