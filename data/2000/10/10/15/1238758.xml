        <p>BELLOW</p>
        <p>A Biography.</p>
        <p>By James Atlas.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 686 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $35.</p>
        <p>About women, Moses Herzog told us: ''They eat green salad and drink human blood.'' It is the same with biographers, who devour the brave hearts of the prey they stalk. Nor would the equally greedy readers of biographies want it any other way -- a cannibal feast of family dysfunction, vile apprenticeship, open wounds, big scores, closet secrets, love gone wrong, grief and grudge. Like Henderson the Rain King, we require ''large and real'' emotions, plus every scrap of evidence before it's shredded. And on Saul Bellow, there's a lot. ''If I had as many mouths as Siva has arms and kept them going all the time,'' his Dangling Man confided, ''I still could not do myself justice.'' So good luck to James Atlas.</p>
        <p>Bellow, moreover, seems bent on confounding even the most scrupulous biographers. At 85, with his rakish Borsalino and Javanese walking stick, he won't get off the stage. Not only did he publish his best novel in years, ''Ravelstein,'' just this spring, but last December -- in the 11th year of his fifth marriage, after three different sons by three different wives -- he fathered his first girl. Let the obit writers wait in line: ''There are enough people with their thumbprint on my windpipe.'' He has apparently decided to stick around longer than Oedipus or Father Zossima. And, like Dr. Pep of Bughouse Square in one of his earliest stories, he will go down sermonizing:</p>
        <p>''Yes, I feel the drum-bumps of the species in me. . . . I partake of everything in my own flesh; I strum on Venusberg and float in the swamp. I do a one-leg schottische along Clark Street and buff the friendly public with my belly. I stroll in the zoo with my colleagues and ponder the throat-digging nails of the lynx and the pillars of the elephant; I sit in the Newberry and compassionate with the tender girls who have never felt anything warmer than a washcloth upon them. And I feel that I and all these creatures and persons are images of spirit, icons, symbols, versions and formations.''</p>
        <p>However confounded, a biographer more scrupulous than Atlas is hard to imagine. He has been on the case like a federal marshal for more than a decade. A hoary old reviewer's scam is to pretend you already knew all the inside stuff before you ever read the biography you're about to quibble with by poaching from. Let me be upfront: Almost everything I know about Bellow that I didn't guess from reading him, I got from the encyclopedic Atlas.</p>
        <p>He has followed the spoor on its escape route -- from Vilnius and the Pale of Settlement and the father fleeing the czar's police; to the working-class melting pot of immigrant alloys on the muddy outskirts of Montreal, where the first New World Bellow was born, in 1915; to rude Chicago, snobby New York, disappointing Paris, ambivalent-making Jerusalem, enNobeling Stockholm -- and then Looped back again. He has read every draft of every essay, story, speech and novel (including theater chronicles for Partisan Review and movie reviews for Horizon); every letter dashed off by the touchy author (including heartbreakers to John Cheever and Cynthia Ozick); every previous stab at the St. Sebastian subject (Mark Harris, Ruth Miller, Daniel Fuchs, Harriet Wasserman); and more than 50 years of criticism (by erstwhile friends, abiding enemies and what Bellow has variously referred to as the ''third-rate vaudevillians'' of the daily press, ''the reptiles of the literary establishment,'' the ''putty-headed academics'' and the ''Ivy League catamites'').</p>
        <p>If you know Bellow and aren't dead, Atlas will have talked to you. If you had an opinion but bought the farm, he's read your diaries, your F.B.I. dossier and maybe your genome. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he'd done time in an orgone box, tried out an anthroposophical breathing exercise (''I Am It Thinks'') and even howled in the woods to find out what these whoop-de-do's felt like. Anybody who reads a Jack Ludwig novel all the way through, just to get his side of the ''Herzog'' adultery story, will obviously stop at nothing to bag his unicorn.</p>
        <p>Thus Atlas has consulted the psychic yard goods salesmen who worked the Chicago territory before Bellow, from Theodore Dreiser to James T. Farrell to Nelson Algren. He is intimate with the Great Books and the 102 Great Ideas, as enumerated by the ''Great Bookie,'' Mortimer Adler, for whose ''Syntopicon'' young Saul swotted up Plato, Tacitus and Hobbes. He has cozied up to the memoirs of those backbiting Partisan Reviewers for whom the crisis of our culture boiled down to Kafka, Trotsky and who got to sleep with Mary McCarthy. (Not Saul, says Atlas: he was ''put off by McCarthy's intellectual and sexual intensity,'' ''needed more subservient women in order to serve his own shaky self-image'' and found ''women who challenged his dominance . . . profoundly threatening.'') He is voluble about the 19th-century masters (especially Stendhal) and the modernist illuminati (especially Joyce) with whom the mature Bellow saw himself in manly grapple. And he is knowledgeable about the whole literature of the Jewish experience in America, from Abraham Cahan to, well, Nathan Zuckerman (although he might have said more about Mary Antin, Henry Roth and Nathanael West) -- which literature was delivered out of exile by Bellow's Augie and his Moses and which deliverance was part assimilation, part synthesis, part transcendence and also ecstatic cabala. ''Orpheus, the son of Greenhorn,'' went a riff in ''Humboldt's Gift'': ''He brought Coney Island into the Aegean and united Buffalo Bill with Rasputin.''</p>
        <p>''Humboldt's Gift'' is a key to this biography, as the overtly autobiographical ''Herzog'' was the ''pivotal'' novel in Bellow's career. Atlas is himself a child of Bellow's northwest side milieu, and so naturally the story of a ''sensitive Jewish boy in Chicago'' is ''a theme dear to my heart.'' But he is also the author of a fine 1977 biography of Delmore Schwartz, and what the novelist did to the poet in ''Humboldt'' still rankles: ''an act of revenge . . . in the guise of a tribute,'' he says, omitting ''the deep sadness'' of Schwartz's life -- the talent wasted, the bright youthful ambition turned to ash.'' And while Atlas the critic is too sophisticated to confuse artful fiction with messy life -- knowing that ''genius assimilates and transforms whatever raw material comes to hand'' -- Atlas the biographer is suspicious of all those masks, sacred and profane, that the artist wears while digging up the buried bodies and playing with the bones.</p>
        <p>So we get the best of several worlds -- colored by a wary disapproval. The literary critic relates ''Dangling Man'' to Rilke's ''Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge,'' ''The Victim'' to Dostoyevsky's ''Eternal Husband'' and ''Seize the Day'' to Dreiser's ''Jennie Gerhardt.'' The scholar informs us that Bellow and Isaac Rosenfeld were known in high school as Zinoviev and Kamenev, the disaffected Bolsheviks; that Whittaker Chambers sabotaged Saul's chances of a job at Time magazine; that Augie March in an early draft went to work for Trotsky in Mexico; that an early draft of ''Herzog'' included a ''homoerotic'' bathtub scene; and that Jack Nicholson owns the film rights to ''Henderson the Rain King.'' The cultural historian relishes identifying Alf Steidler as Studs Terkel, Victor Wulpy as Harold Rosenberg, Zetland as Isaac Rosenfeld, Sewell as R. P. Blackmur and Magnasco as Hilton Kramer, as well as the highbrow gossip, mean-minded feuds and caustic Bellovian wisecracks (reading his former editor, William Phillips, he said, was ''much like trying to go scuba diving at Coney Island in urinous brine and scraps of old paper, orange rinds and soaked hot dog buns''). And the Chicago-born biographer -- even if he has decided that, as much as he admires the ''moral depth and commanding vision'' of the novelist, he doesn't especially care for the man -- gets nevertheless to go home again, and dream Bellovian dreams of Julien Sorel, Frederic Moreau, Paul Morel and Stephen Dedalus.</p>
        <p>''Each man has his batch of poems,'' said Herzog -- a self-mythology, almost a personal creation myth, like the Songlines and Dreamtime of Bruce Chatwin's Aboriginals. For Solomon Bellow, age 8, it was Ward H in the Chicago hospital to which he was committed for an emergency appendectomy, and where he remained for six months, suffering from peritonitis and pneumonia, reading ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and the funny papers, rehearsing his subsequent abandonments. And, sure enough, the mother who consumed novels and wore ostrich plumes died when he was 17, leaving him unprotected from the brutal Old World father (junk-dealing bootlegger) and the money-grubbing older brothers (coal yards, nursing homes, landfills) who were so contemptuous of his bookishness (''some schmuck with a pen,'' he would recall 40 years after the fact). Already, he felt that ''I was born to be a performing and interpretive creature, that I was meant to take part in a peculiar, exalted game.'' Already, he had that astonishing ''singleness of purpose'' that would sustain him while his contemporaries were cracking up (''They were all Stradivarius violins,'' wrote Leslie Fiedler, ''and at any moment a string could snap''). And already, the world could never possibly love him enough.</p>
        <p>It's this psychodynamic -- depressed in the Depression; narcissistic and masochistic ever after; subverting determinism, denying dependency, leaving before he was left but always filling up pages with words -- that Atlas emphasizes throughout, from Pushkin, the Pentateuch and the Fourth International in high school; to those snatched semesters at the University of Chicago (too expensive), Northwestern (where the English department's genteel anti-Semitism nudged him into anthropology) and Wisconsin (where he studied ''savages'' like himself and women like ''a foreign tribe''); to the teaching of Flaubert and Joyce at Pestalozzi-Froebel Teacher's College and the collecting of his $24 weekly paycheck from the Federal Writers' Project; to his first story in Partisan Review and his first novel, ''Dangling Man'' -- in which glum existential parenthesis Joseph wonderfully reminded us, ''We are all drawn toward the same craters of the spirit -- to know what we are and what we are for, to know our purpose, to seek grace.''</p>
        <p>Always, in the middle of a book, he was tearing up his life, trading in one wife for another a decade younger, complaining about child support and punishing the castoffs in his next fiction. Atlas suggests that so long as he ''still experienced himself as the son,'' abandoned and betrayed by the mother who died without his permission, he was unable ''to sustain relationships with women.'' Or with his oldest buddies: ''He was ardently loyal to anyone who passed the rigorous test of friendship -- for as long as they served his needs.'' Or with colleagues and competitors: ''Writers who posed a threat to Bellow's hegemony got the cold shoulder; writers who occupied a place safely below his own on the literary ladder were seen as comrades in the 'travail business.' ''According to Atlas: ''Divorces, estrangements from friends, abrupt departures from jobs, nonattendance at funerals -- the defensive mechanism was the same. Leave before you're left.''</p>
        <p>Even the Partisan Reviewers who did so much to boost his career were suspect: ''Those dying beasts,'' he called them. ''They want to cook their meals over Pater's hard gemlike flame and light their cigarettes at it.'' From Edmund Wilson and John Updike he expected indifference, hostility and ''the whole WASP effort to suppress the Jewish novel.'' But from the New York intellectuals, he demanded unconditional, rhapsodic surrender: ''It wasn't that they didn't love him; they didn't love him enough.'' And so he went into attack mode. And while holding a grudge against Norman Podhoretz -- who had been designated by Clement Greenberg as Commentary's ''hit man'' on ''Augie'' -- may be the normal respiration of intelligence, attacking Lionel Trilling for things he never said, calling off a deal with his new publisher because it had hired Ted Solotaroff, who had written a mixed review of ''Herzog,'' resigning from the Century Club because it voted in William Phillips and Richard Poirier and never forgiving his old friend Alfred Kazin for his failure to adore ''Mr. Sammler's Planet'' are kindergarten tantrums.</p>
        <p>Sammler! One is reminded of hit-man Podhoretz, who in ''Ex-Friends'' accused almost everybody he'd ever known of bad faith, false consciousness, failure of nerve and/or cowardice. Not only did it never occur to him that his ex-friends might have been right about anything; it never even occurred to him that they might have been sincere. This is how you end up at The New York Post or the Committee on Social Thought, wondering where the parties went. To be sure, the New York intellectuals needed Bellow to write the books that they couldn't. But if he was looking to these patriarchs for the approval he never got from his father, he looked in the wrong bound volume. Sons were the last thing they wanted.</p>
        <p>So Saul Bellow has intimacy issues. We might have guessed. Philip Roth certainly did, in his ''Ghost Writer'' portrait of Felix Abravanel: ''The charm was like a moat so oceanic that you could not even see the great turreted and buttressed thing it had been dug to protect.'' That he should also have what Atlas calls a ''need to create obstacles and enemies'' was obvious even to his creature Herzog, the last imploding Romantic: ''The depressive character is narcissistic. It fears the disappearance of the beloved. Above all terrors it places the terror of abandonment and naked solitude. So with secret hate it cuts off the deserters.''</p>
        <p>Alas, the deeper into the biography, the harder it is to recall what we admired so much in the fiction. For the biographer, too, it all seems to turn as sour as Sammler. He is disinclined to rank Bellow among living writers or the noble dead, an odd reticence in such an ambitious book. (Though maybe a healthy one. Bellow himself wondered: ''Why should writers wish to be rated -- seeded -- like tennis players? Handicapped like racehorses? What an epitaph for a novelist: 'He won all the polls'!'') Atlas can be seen to wince at Bellow's blackballing of Amiri Baraka, Susan Sontag and Edward Said as MacArthur fellows, his general misogyny and particular animus for feminism (''All you're going to have to show for your movement 10 years from now are sagging breasts!''), his ''ill-concealed racism'' and, till Allan Bloom came back to Chicago, his hectoring homophobia. Perhaps the stupidest thing he ever said -- that reading Nadine Gordimer was ''like gagging on a Kotex'' -- is quoted by Atlas without comment, because there is nothing to add or subtract. He wants out, as if from Dewey Spangler's colostomy bag in ''The Dean's December.''</p>
        <p>And yet, and yet, despite, besides: In a wicked new biography of Arthur Rimbaud, Graham Robb reports on the young poet's moving into the Paris hotel room of a dissipated pianist who, in his spare time, ''collected old shoes which he used for flower-pots.'' Isn't that nifty? Well, there are lots of old shoes in ''Bellow'' and some lovely flowers potted in them, too, such as the sight of Saul reading John Donne in a hammock. Or the words he wrote to Alice Adams, with whom he had a brief fling, when she was feeling low: ''I am only urging you to utter the magic syllable 'Whoosh' in the face of psychological oppression. The 19th century drove writers into attics. The 20th shuts them into nutshells. The only remedy is to declare yourself king, or queen, of infinite space.'' Or his imagining himself as ''a novel written by the ghost of Jules Verne and raised by Tutankhamen and Wm. Faulkner -- about a Prince of Egypt reincarnated in the 20th Century, fond of southern whiskey and doomed to jet about the earth.'' I'd rather imagine him talking to the dead like Herzog -- or on the road somewhere between Kafka's Castle and the Leaning Tower of Isaac Babel, wearing Gogol's overcoat and Melville's whaling boots, with wheelbarrow and a kite, fishing the sky for souls.</p>
        <p>So, like Henderson, I want it all. Yeats believed in faeries, and Pound in funny money, and Doris Lessing in flying saucers. Let Bellow have his orgone box and his ''peculiar metaphysics as flying creatures have their radar.'' Picasso was nasty, brutish and short, but he changed the way we saw the world. It was the same for me in high school, when ''The Adventures of Augie March'' hit me as ''Moby-Dick'' hit Zetland, like a torpedo: ''He thought he would drown. But he didn't drown; he floated.'' Shooting the rapids of his own verbal torrent, revving up to escape velocity, he not only took me into the eagle's ''infinite spaces'' but recharged the batteries of the ordinary all around. Words had colors, ideas had feelings, thinkers did push-ups in my bedroom, identity itself was up for grabs, and I was all of a sudden vouchsafed ''the universal eligibility to be noble.'' Even to a lapsed Catholic on the blue-collar margins of a California beach town, it was as thrilling as teenage sex or modern art.</p>
        <p>Atlas must have felt the same before he began this long journey into knowing too much. I could no more stop reading his biography than I could stop reading Saul Bellow after he blew the blinds off the windows in my head. All over again in ''Ravelstein,'' with a flock of parrots eating red berries in the Chicago snow, he recovered his fast ball from his mean streak. It's the prose equivalent of break dancing. Barbed, breezy, disheveled and surreal; salt-savoring and brain-fevered; brilliant twitchy patter and Great Books patois; colloquial and mandarin, sentimental and neobaroque; Talmudic mutter and gangster slang; deep chords and stop-action; the long irony, the low laugh, the short fuse and a three-cushion bank shot into a side pocket where the anguish they speak may be Yiddish but we must all of us rise and fall and live and die without our mothers -- such a style miracle-whips.</p>
