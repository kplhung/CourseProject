        <p>The alarm clock buzzes at 8 a.m. in January, and Derek Jeter crawls out of bed to start another day of workouts. He stumbles across the hardwood floors and into his kitchen for some orange juice, and leaves his house by 8:30. Spring training is six weeks away, but Jeter is already working because he wants to be able to do exactly what he did last night.</p>
        <p>Jeter wants to get stronger, better and smarter, which is why he moved to Tampa, Fla., six years ago and spends 50 weeks a year playing baseball. His eyes are still bleary and the weather is cool when Jeter gets to the Yankees' minor league complex there. The fields are empty and Jeter starts to work like an unemployed minor leaguer.</p>
        <p>The relevance of those wake-up calls resonated in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series last night. Jeter knows the lusty swing that produced a prodigious three-run homer off Paul Abbott and helped steer Roger Clemens and the Yankees past the fading Mariners, 5-0, was born in a backyard in Kalamazoo, Mich., and is now bred in Tampa. Those endless hours of practice are Jeter's secret weapon.</p>
        <p>''I think you give yourself a chance to reflect about that stuff when the season is over,'' Jeter said. ''I don't want to do that now. If you do that now, you get yourself in trouble.''</p>
        <p>As Jeter's shot kept climbing to center field, Mike Cameron kept pursuing it. The acrobatic Cameron stole a homer from Jeter in April, but his leap was in vain this time. When Abbott saw Jeter's ball vanish over the fence, he said, ''Oh my God.'' There was silence at Safeco Field when Jeter, blowing a bubble and pumping his fist, breezed around the bases.</p>
        <p>''Huge at-bat, huge hit,'' right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ''He's Derek Jeter, man. That's what he's supposed to do.''</p>
        <p>Because Clemens was intimidating the Mariners, Jeter's homer in the fifth inning surely deflated them. The game was over. Clemens buzzed fastballs that reached 99 miles an hour and he was even more relaxed after Jeter's homer, finishing with a one-hitter spiced with 15 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>Before the game, Reggie Jackson, the Hall of Famer who was known as Mr. October, was praising the Yankees for knowing how to win. Jackson lumped Clemens, the future Hall of Famer who now has four victories in 15 postseason starts, in a group of players who thrive when the scrutiny is most intense. Why Jackson said it was uncertain, but the real Mr. October was right about the Mr. October for a night.</p>
        <p>''Clemens is going to show you that tonight by pitching well,'' Jackson said. ''He's going to have a tough time. If he gets out of it, they're going to get beaten. The good ones are like that.''</p>
        <p>After hitting 15 homers this season, his lowest total since he had 10 in 1997, Jeter has already belted two during the A.L.C.S. Jeter hit a two-run homer during the seven-run eighth inning in Game 2 and then helped bury the Mariners last night and probably forever.</p>
        <p>Back in Wesley Chapel, Fla., Gary Denbo was smiling. Denbo, who was Jeter's first minor league manager and is now the Yankees' hitting coordinator, works with him during all of those quiet mornings on barren fields.</p>
        <p>Denbo called Jeter last week and offered three pieces of advice. He told Jeter that he needed to stand more upright because he had no chance to bash certain inside pitches if he tilted forward. Denbo also advised Jeter to try to hit to the middle of the field instead of trying to pull everything. Finally, Denbo counseled Jeter on taking a better swing path and moving his bat through the strike zone at a steady rate. On the memorable homer, Jeter remained upright, he hit the ball to the middle of the field and his swing was true.</p>
        <p>''It's a good feeling to know that you've worked with him and maybe you've contributed a little bit to his success,'' Denbo said by telephone last night. ''He's a great student. After you talk to him, he does it.''</p>
        <p>When Jeter was asked if he might buy Denbo dinner, he said, ''I owe him a lot more than one dinner.''</p>
        <p>Denbo sheepishly warned whoever plays the Yankees this October or in Octobers to come about what the future holds for Jeter. ''He can hit for more power and for a higher average,'' Denbo said. ''I don't think he's as good as he's going to get. That's good for the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>Alex Rodriguez, Jeter's buddy, placed his right foot in the batter's box and swiveled his cleats in the dirt to get comfortable. The game was in the first inning and, even as fans waved white towels, there was still a serene atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Clemens changed that with one fastball that whistled near Rodriguez's neck and caused him to stumble backward as if he were shoved. Boos erupted. Just to make sure the message was received, Clemens unleashed another fastball that almost kissed A-Rod's chin.</p>
        <p>That was the first message Clemens sent, but it was not the last as he showed the ferocious approach that the Yankees have always wanted to see. Jeter sent another message with a homer. If the Yankees send one more today, they will be in the World Series again.</p>
