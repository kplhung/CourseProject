        <p>Bananas</p>
        <p>An American History.</p>
        <p>By Virginia Scott Jenkins.</p>
        <p>Smithsonian Institution, paper, $16.95.</p>
        <p>''Everyone likes bananas,'' Virginia Scott Jenkins writes, ''but no one takes them seriously.'' She tries hard to do so in her deadpan recitation of every known fact about the fruit she calls ''our friends,'' but she has no sense of the absurd. It's impossible to read an appendix of banana song titles or a full chapter devoted to a Kentucky banana festival without thinking how much better it would play as camp. Jenkins, a scholar in residence at the Chesapeake Maritime Museum, has a good story. There is nothing serendipitous about how the banana became America's cheapest and most popular fruit -- politics and marketing had everything to do with it. And who knew that the cruise industry was born in the banana trade with Central America, or that monkeys in the wild really don't eat bananas? Unfortunately, all this is told with endless repetition and dizzying jumps in time. The chapter on eating bananas is particularly stupefying (''homemade banana bread is considered a thoughtful hostess present''). It is worth plowing through this poorly organized treatise to appreciate how Jenkins lets loose on the ''Meaning of Bananas'' when she finally gets around to acknowledging the phallic connotation. But she goes over the top, citing everyone from Freud to Phil Silvers to Mae West.</p>
