        <p>Get ready to pay more for books. This year, the country's biggest bookstore chains and online stores all quietly raised their prices.</p>
        <p>Barnes &amp; Noble, the largest chain, has stopped discounting its hardcover books by 10 percent off the cover price. Borders Books ended its 10 percent discount on hardcovers last fall. Both superstore chains now usually discount less than 150 best-selling and heavily promoted titles.</p>
        <p>Amazon.com, the online retailer,  lowered its discounts by 10 percent of the cover price across the board --  from 50 percent to 40 percent off the cover price of best sellers, from 30 percent to 20 percent off the cover price of hardcover books, and from 20 percent to 10 percent off paperbacks. Publishers say a growing majority of Amazon.com's titles receive no discount at all. And Amazon.com raised its lowest charge for shipping books from roughly $4.00 to at least $4.50 a purchase. Including shipping, all but the most expensive and popular books now cost more online than at the cover price.</p>
        <p>Publishers stand to see demand fall as readers pay more. Looking on the bright side, they note that Wal-Mart, Price Club and other general retailers still discount heavily, albeit on a limited inventory of books.</p>
