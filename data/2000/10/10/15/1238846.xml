        <p>IT looks like a colossal town house, but the limestone building at 10 East 71st Street -- 13 floors masquerading as 4 -- is really the Frick Art Reference Library, built in 1935 by Helen Clay Frick as a memorial to her father, Henry. Readers now dodge netting and dripping water from restoration crews to enter one of the world's great art libraries, created by a woman who found in her father's art collection both triumph and torment.</p>
        <p>Helen Frick was born in the Frick family home in Pittsburgh well after her father  accumulated enormous wealth in coal and steel, but the childhood deaths of a sister and brother left the house, and her father, in a permanent state of near-mourning. Helen never married and developed a close bond with her father, especially over his growing art collection. According to ''Henry Clay Frick: an Intimate Portrait,'' by his great-granddaughter Martha Frick Symington Sanger (Abbeville Press, 1998), Helen was hobbled by guilt that she may have given her father an improper sedative the night he died in 1919.</p>
        <p>In 1920, Helen Frick was touring the London art library of Robert C. Witt, who had collected copies and reproductions of artworks for study, and, after asking, ''May I copycat you?,'' did just that, at first taking over a bowling alley in the basement of the Frick mansion, at Fifth Avenue and 70th Street. In 1924, she opened a library, one story high, in a separate building on East 71st Street, just west of the present library. By 1931, when Helen's mother, Adelaide, died, the library was cramped for space.  Helen Frick bought two adjacent town houses, demolished them, and hired John Russell Pope -- architect of the National Gallery and the Jefferson Memorial in Washington -- to design what remains a stunning work of side street architecture.</p>
        <p>Above a recessed entryway rises a rusticated base supporting a giant apparently single story with great windows and a wide blank wall, topped by an intricate frieze. Above that are two setback stories. The blank wall and huge scale suggest a war memorial or mausoleum, but inside Pope created 13 levels of shelving and offices. The large windows light a high, sunny reading room with tile floors and, in the painted frieze, images of the heads of Helen Frick's  two dogs, Bobby and Pat.</p>
        <p>On that level to the rear, Helen Frick had paneling salvaged from the mansion bowling alley installed in a smaller reading room, and, at the back, she created a medieval-style office with antique fireplace, linen-fold paneling and bottle-end glass windows. On the top floor, she installed the paneling from an 18th-century Massachusetts house in the staff lounge, but also built a tiled lunchroom with southwestern and Art Deco overtones.</p>
        <p>When the new library opened in 1935, Time magazine noted that it was ''instantly recognized as one of the most important art libraries in the world.'' For in addition to books, Helen Frick had scoured Europe and America for reproductions of important paintings, not settling for a single image but collecting successive pictures as paintings were restored, repainted and even damaged, and also assembling histories of their costs, exhibition, critical reception and ownership.</p>
        <p>She also sent photography teams out to record undocumented artworks, including trips along the Eastern Seaboard and to the South, often knocking on doors of old houses solely on the suspicion that a painting might lay within. Katherine McCook Knox's 1979 book, ''The Story of the Frick Art Reference Library: The Early Years,'' captures the excitement of these trips, like the time Helen Frick knocked on a door in Front Royal, Va., looking for a Gilbert Stuart portrait somewhere in the area, to be greeted by, ''Come right on in; how did you know where it was?''</p>
        <p>This focus on American art, including works by anonymous painters, is somewhat surprising, given the Frick Collection's reputation for old-master and 19th-century European works. ''We're also trying to let the art community know we go up to the mid-20th century,'' said Patricia Barnett, the head librarian. Among the documents the library owns are a pamphlet for Jackson Pollock's first one-man show.</p>
        <p>A 1939 profile of Helen Frick by John McCarten in The New Yorker described her as ''a frail little woman, weighing less than 100 pounds . . . who looks not at all like the forceful character that she really is.'' Mr. McCarten noted that Helen Frick had barred researchers with Teutonic names  because of her disgust with Germany's actions in World War I and that she was ''quick to resent an actual or imagined affront.''</p>
        <p>SHE was in frequent conflict with John D. Rockefeller Jr., whom her father  had also appointed a trustee of the Frick Collection. Helen Frick wanted to keep the house as it had been lived in, but Rockefeller thought it should be a real museum and so to him the furniture and personal effects that Helen Frick wanted kept in place were extra baggage. In 1948, Rockefeller offered to give paintings by Botticelli, Goya and Fragonard to the Frick Collection but was so vehemently opposed by Helen Frick, who wanted to keep non-Frick acquisitions out of the collection, that the matter went to court, where she lost.</p>
        <p>In 1961, during a similar battle over accepting artworks from the Rockefellers, she resigned from the board of the Frick Collection in a fury. Ray Anne Lockard, head librarian of the Frick Fine Arts Library at the University of Pittsburgh, said that in  1967, in a controversy over the employment of Germans and the exhibition of modern art at the university, Helen Frick withdrew her support of the library, which she had built in 1965.</p>
        <p>Helen Frick was director of the Frick Art Reference Library until 1983, when she was persuaded to resign. Martha Sanger's book quotes a witness who said that, after Helen Frick resigned, she ''turned her face to the wall and said she wanted to die.'' Helen Frick died in Pittsburgh the next year at age 96.</p>
        <p>Today the Frick library reading room is one of the most civilized places to read in New York. Any adult with a serious interest in art is admitted without protocol to a reading room with studded leather doors with highly figured marble surrounds. Six thousand came last year, served by the library's $2.9 million annual budget.</p>
        <p>The library has art periodicals and books and World Wide Web connections (the library's Web site is part of the Frick Collection's, www.frick.org), as well as diaries and sketchbooks by artists like Thomas Sully and John F. Kensett. But what makes it unique is the archive, begun by Helen Frick, of 1 million photographs. Thus for a single Degas painting of ballet dancers, the researcher may examine reproductions of 14 studies, prints and other directly related works separately owned in far-flung collections.</p>
        <p>The file for the portrait of Sir Thomas More by Hans Holbein the Younger, which hangs next door in the Frick Collection, has dozens of other versions, copies, misattributions, impostors and other works, all with separate annotations as to maker, provenance and condition.</p>
        <p>The building is now covered in scaffolding as the facade is cleaned and stonework repaired, a project complementary to one almost completed at the Frick Collection itself, where work was undertaken earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Although lines often back up outside the collection, at Helen Frick's library researchers simply go in and out one or two at a time. Each one passes the reserved plaque she installed, which names not the founder but her inspiration: ''This library was founded in loving memory of Henry Clay Frick by his daughter.''</p>
