        <p>It's a Bird, It's a Plane, But Now a Smaller Risk</p>
        <p>It's still big birds versus little birds at Kennedy International Airport.</p>
        <p>The big birds, of course, are the metallic monsters weighing hundreds of thousands of pounds that carry wingless members of the ecosystem on their migrations around the globe. The little birds are the flesh-and-feather fliers weighing as little as a pound that nest next to the airport, in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in Queens.</p>

        <p>It's a Bird, It's a Plane, But Now a Smaller Risk</p>
        <p>It's still big birds versus little birds at Kennedy International Airport.</p>
        <p>The big birds, of course, are the metallic monsters weighing hundreds of thousands of pounds that carry wingless members of the ecosystem on their migrations around the globe. The little birds are the flesh-and-feather fliers weighing as little as a pound that nest next to the airport, in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in Queens.</p>
        <p>It would seem to be no contest should a jetliner or even a smaller plane collide with a gull or a goose. While the bird is surely a goner, however, the plane can also suffer, even fatally. Birds sucked into an engine can cause it to stall and the plane to crash, as has sometimes happened around the world.</p>
        <p>At Kennedy, where the bird threat is among the country's worst, close calls are remembered. In 1975, an engine choked with gulls caused a departing DC-10 to catch fire, but there were only minor injuries among the nearly 150 people on board. In 1995, an arriving Concorde caught fire after its engines sucked in geese, but none of the 79 people aboard were hurt.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Kennedy's operator, has long been in a shoo-and-shoot war against the birds. Early tactics, such as firing propane-gas cannons to frighten them with loud noise, did not help much. In 1991, the authority began using marksmen to shoot down gulls, among the leaders on the bad-bird list because of their prevalence.</p>
        <p>Advocates for animals were enraged, but an average of 10,000 gulls a year were shot through 1996, when the authority added a method to reduce the shootings: falconry. Bird wings are swung in the air on long cords, inciting the falcons to swoop after the lures.</p>
        <p>''The theory is birds can see them in a hunting mode and are frightened away,'' said Laura Francoeur, a wildlife biologist with the authority.</p>
        <p>Peter Yerkes, an authority spokesman, said that all the efforts had helped cut contacts between birds and planes from 315 in 1989 to 133 last year, and that falconry had helped reduce the number of birds shot from nearly 15,000 in 1991 to 3,400 last year.</p>
        <p>Manhattan Auto Racing Can Be Stop and Go</p>
        <p>Some New Yorkers found the idea outlandish and disliked the sponsor. Others saw a boon to the city's economy. In 1992, the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins gave the go-ahead for a Marlboro Grand Prix of New York, in which Lower Manhattan's streets would become a temporary auto racing track.</p>
        <p>Professional drivers would zoom up to 165 miles an hour within concrete barriers, as they had on streets in some other major cities and still do in Houston and Long Beach, Calif. New York officials envisioned $56 million being spent at hotels, restaurants and stores by visitors to the spectacle.</p>
        <p>Then it disappeared like exhaust. The promoters canceled, citing higher costs than expected.</p>
        <p>The idea, however, is not out of gas. The City Sports Commission has received another such proposal from another promoter, Ralph E. Preite, a Manhattan lawyer and the president of New York Motorsports.</p>
        <p>''It's very preliminary,'' Mr. Preite said on Friday, adding that he would seek financing if chances of city approval seemed good. ''We prefer Manhattan, but it could be any borough.''</p>
        <p>The sports agency's commissioner, Kenneth J. Podziba, said it was too early to discuss the proposal because ''it hasn't left the infancy stage.''</p>
