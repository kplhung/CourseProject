        <p>EVEN on a clear night in New York, the sky is a hazy, purple blanket and the heavens are difficult to find. A constellation here, a moon there, but the city cannot compete with the country, where stars are sprinkled like diamonds on black velvet.</p>
        <p>And yet Michael O'Gara is up on the roof of his East 79th Street apartment marveling at Saturn. In Ward Hill, Staten Island, Eileen Thomas is hanging out her attic window hunting for comets. Over in Breezy Point, Queens, Stephen Lieber is building what he predicts will be the largest telescope mirror the city has ever seen. He has been at it for nine years.</p>
        <p>But how, in this glittering city, do such people find their way to the stars? With innovation, desperation and, of course, obsession. No respectable amateur would look up without it.</p>
        <p>''Amateur astronomers are a rare breed,'' Mr. O'Gara said. ''They are some of the most intelligent people I've ever met and some of the strangest, too. But we all share this wonderment, this need to explore what's out there. And even in the city, if you get hooked, you'll find a way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Gara is a 47-year-old television producer who knows every dark spot in Manhattan. Head for the river banks or Central Park on Sundays after 11 p.m., he said, because that's when the city starts to dim. Novice astronomers can also join the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York, whose 300 members gather at monthly star parties. Carl Schurz Park and Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan, Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx are popular gazing places.</p>
        <p>But like Mr. O'Gara, amateurs are always on the lookout for better views. When he bought a weekend home last year, he even made sure his home sat in shadow so he could see the Milky Way with his naked eye.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomas, a 55-year-old real estate agent, said what she laughingly called her addiction and a desire for darker skies compelled her to trade a loft in SoHo for a home in Ward Hill 10 years ago. Now she no longer has to point her telescope directly above apartment windows across the street. Ms. Thomas, a former Rockette who sometimes dresses celestially in starry pants and colors her hair purple and blue, is often called the city's best amateur asteroid hunter. She has located hundreds of asteroids from her makeshift attic observatory.</p>
        <p>''It's not for the faint of heart,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''You have to be willing to look like an idiot. But it's way worth it. I mean, don't just get out of the subway. Get out of the galaxy.''</p>
        <p>Some amateurs rely on electronic devices to align their telescopes or track star movements, but Ms. Thomas still prefers to pore over star maps. She has armfuls of maps, which helped her find Comet Linear when it arced overheard in August. The comet's energy was sapped after a trip too close to the Sun, and now it is completely gone, dissipated.</p>
        <p>''It's almost miraculous that I found it,'' she said. ''It just looked like a fuzzy star with no visible tail, but I saw it.''</p>
        <p>Plenty of amateurs are content to hang out at star parties and peer into other people's eyepieces, but eventually amateurs long for the ultimate stamp of obsession: a homemade telescope of one's own. Mr. Lieber, for example, wants to see the wisps of clouds of individual storms on Jupiter with his own telescope. So since 1991, he has been grinding away on a 17.5-inch telescope mirror that sits in his living room beside blueprints and books like ''Coming of Age in the Milky Way.''</p>
        <p>His scope cannot compare to the 400-inch mirrors at professional observatories. But Mr. Lieber, a 42-year-old car-parts salesman who admits to suffering from aperture fever (thirsting after the bigger and better mirror), is confident his creation will offer the best views by an amateur in city limits. And in what may truly mark an urban astronomer, he said he no longer even wished for country nights. ''I would have to give up New York City,'' he said. ''Besides, there's an old joke about city astronomers: you take them out to the country, and they get disoriented. Too many stars.''</p>
        <p>URBAN TACTICS  Correction:  November 12, 2000, Sunday  An article on Oct. 15 about amateur astronomers in the city misstated the number of asteroids spotted by Eileen Thomas of Ward Hill, Staten Island. She says she has seen at least a dozen, not hundreds. The article also misstated the time at which Ms. Thomas saw the comet Linear. It was late July, not August.</p>
