        <p>A fight over oversized trucks on Broome Street has turned into a game of cat and mouse over traffic signs.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, some residents have tampered with road signs that discourage truck drivers leaving the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges from turning off Lafayette Street onto Broome Street. Using duct tape and a ladder, residents masked portions of the signs in order to suggest that trucks were barred from Broome 24 hours a day. The unaltered signs barred trucks from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>The Department of Transportation began removing the duct tape, only to see it return the next morning. Then two weeks ago the signs disappeared altogether. ''We don't know who took them down,'' said Tom Cocola, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>The city then installed new signs that read ''local truck route.'' Now, residents are threatening to remove the new signs, saying they are ambiguous and don't keep interstate truck traffic off their street.</p>
        <p>''By the end of next week, the current signs will be obliterated,'' said a resident who admitting tampering with the signs. ''They have imperiously and illegally created a new truck route.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cocola said Broome Street was ''a route for local deliveries only,'' but he acknowledged that it was hard to tell the difference between through and local trucks.</p>
        <p>The volume of trucks in the area has risen sharply since 1986, when Congress reversed the tolls on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and made it free coming into the city and double fare going out. As a result, trucks heading to New Jersey began crossing through Lower Manhattan to avoid tolls.</p>
        <p>State Senator Thomas K. Duane said he planned to meet with Transportation Commissioner Iris Weinshall to request new signs that read, ''No trucks allowed anytime, except for local deliveries.''</p>
