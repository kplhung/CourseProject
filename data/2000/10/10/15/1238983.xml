        <p>Plaid isn't just for trench coat linings anymore. After last year's craze for Burberry plaid, the fashion world is finding ways to tweak the tartan. This season, using whimsical materials like leather and fur, and processes like tie-dyeing and silk-screening, designers are exploding the pattern of decorum. Even Burberry breaks out of the traditional grid -- as witnessed by its new monochrome jacquard plaid ties and bold plaid high-heel boots. To be sure, too much of a good thing can cause ganglion overload: Don't try these combos outside your home.</p>
        <p>Crossing lines at every price point, a semi-serious purple fur bag by Dolce &amp; Gabbana ($830), a diagonal fur version by Barbara Rihl ($425) and a fringed kilt of a pocketbook by American Eagle ($34) are all equipped with this year's longer, fresher shoulder strap.</p>
