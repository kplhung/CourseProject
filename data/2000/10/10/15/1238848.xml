        <p>THE lobby of the Quick Center at Fairfield University, where theatrical and musical entertainment is presented, is fittingly festooned with large banners and scrolls. These works, with buoyant floral motifs and other images festive and profound, by Wang Ming, also serve as a lead-in to an exhibition by Mr. Ming in the adjacent Thomas J. Walsh Art Gallery.</p>
        <p>Exhibitions that feature calligraphy can discourage viewers because the material is ultimately inaccessible and too complex for a casual visit. But Mr. Ming does not let such a mood set in because he employs a boldness and color sense that might remind viewers of Pop Art, as well as innovative formats that keep the audience on their toes. He also hints that deep mysteries are conveyed by his inviting schemes.</p>

        <p>THE lobby of the Quick Center at Fairfield University, where theatrical and musical entertainment is presented, is fittingly festooned with large banners and scrolls. These works, with buoyant floral motifs and other images festive and profound, by Wang Ming, also serve as a lead-in to an exhibition by Mr. Ming in the adjacent Thomas J. Walsh Art Gallery.</p>
        <p>Exhibitions that feature calligraphy can discourage viewers because the material is ultimately inaccessible and too complex for a casual visit. But Mr. Ming does not let such a mood set in because he employs a boldness and color sense that might remind viewers of Pop Art, as well as innovative formats that keep the audience on their toes. He also hints that deep mysteries are conveyed by his inviting schemes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ming, who was born near Beijing in 1921, emigrated to the United States in 1951. That he has strong ties to two cultures is evident. The duality is most pronounced in his treatment of calligraphy. In China, calligraphy, made with formalized brush strokes, and painting are regarded as branches of the same art. In the West, such brush strokes can be vehicles for personal expression. This concept was central to Abstract Expressionism, the most American of art movements, in which Mr. Ming participated when he first came to this country.</p>
        <p>The exhibition's curator, Jeffrey Weschler, is from the Zimmerli Museum at Rutgers University in New Jersey. He chose to emphasize Mr. Ming's more recent work, which marks a return to traditional Chinese formats: the scroll and the album that unfolds in accordion fashion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ming does almost everything in a large scale, and some of his albums span entire walls when opened. They are presented at eye level, and if  viewers survey a work from one direction they see one kind of image. The other direction means contrasting image and the two often create a dynamic.</p>
        <p>On the checklist of works, the album pieces are listed as ''dimensions variable,'' which means their size increases or decreases depending on how extensively the work is unfolded, and that pliability is a kind of dynamic in itself.</p>
        <p>The work titled ''Ink Play of the Dancing Dragon'' points up the resemblance of the album format to the snaky paper dragons that are often highlight Chinese holidays.</p>
        <p>In the album titled ''Between the Circle and the Square'' the insistent alternation of the two shapes makes the viewer realize that the title is pointing to something intangible, neither one geometric form or the other.</p>
        <p>The paramount nature of the ungraspable in this very palpable exhibition is a paradox and the mystery of Mr. Ming's mature art.</p>
        <p>Always central to Chinese thought is the concept of Chi, which, quickly defined, is the invisible vital energy or life force that flows through everything. When viewers realize the importance of Chi, by Mr. Ming's constant invoking of it, they can read the albums in a different way. They are not seen so much as separate panels divided by creases but as objects that flow (flow is the term most frequently used to describe how Chi operates).</p>
        <p>Mr. Ming gives us aspects of the Chi in different guises. ''Beyond Tangible Phenomena'' is like a fold-out map of the heavens in which each panel bears a circle on which the positions of the stars are plotted. This work illustrates how complex Mr. Ming's art can be in purely visual terms. Here and elsewhere he uses a splatter technique and the background against which each circle is place is mottled; this furthers a feeling of remoteness, perhaps like the surface of the moon.</p>
        <p>A different kind of splattering is used on the circles. They are made of red and yellow paint and can serve as stars. On the circles are aggregates of box-like forms; they represent the figures when stars in a constellation are linked by lines. If Mr. Ming can get highly cosmic he can also voyage deeply in another direction and allude to what is very personal. One such album is ''Dust of the Heart.'' A dimension between the heart and the heavens is hinted at by the title of another book, ''Landscape Like Embroidery.''</p>
        <p>Images on scrolls or vertical panels are often thick, black brush strokes combined to form recognizable images. ''Silent World'' can be read as a meditating figure with his legs crossed in the lotus position. But ''Symbol of an Apple: Past and Present'' is ultimately unsatisfying because the rough silhouette of a female figure asks to be read as Eve, but the context she's in is ambiguous.</p>
        <p>Since most of the work with allusions to calligraphy features the familiar and forceful black brush stroke, the thin vertical panel ''The Unity of the Universe'' stands out because the marks are white, and oddly resemble hoarfrost.</p>
        <p>What visitors are treated to in this exhibition is a deft balancing act. Ancient art traditions are raided by Mr. Ming but not plundered, and modern, if not cutting-edge, content is harmoniously introduced.</p>
        <p>''Universal Dimensions: Scrolls and Screens by Wang Ming'' is at the Thomas J. Walsh Gallery at Fairfield University through Dec. 17.</p>
