        <p>The Rangers have often said how much they want to play up-tempo hockey this season. Tonight, Jaromir Jagr and the high-flying Pittsburgh Penguins were only too happy to oblige.</p>
        <p>Mark Messier scored twice on the power play for the Rangers, giving the 39-year-old captain three goals in three games. And Theo Fleury scored twice as well, including once on the power play.</p>
        <p>But those numbers could not offset the first four-goal game of Jaromir Jagr's career, as the Penguins shook off three one-goal deficits, scored four consecutive third-period goals and handed the Rangers their first loss of the season, 8-6.</p>
        <p>Jagr saved his final two goals for the final period. His third goal of the game came 53 seconds into the third. It also came with all five Rangers caught on a line change.</p>
        <p>''I was screaming at our defense,'' said Jagr, who could not believe what he was seeing. ''I was screaming, 'Give me the puck!' Because nobody was there.''</p>
        <p>The goal, which broke a 4-4 tie, gave Jagr his seventh career hat trick and ignited the final-period onslaught.</p>
        <p>''Jagr was great,'' Rangers Coach Ron Low said. ''But Jagr was great when he was left all alone.''</p>
        <p>Martin Straka and the rookie Roman Simicek, who got his first National Hockey League goal, also scored in the third period for the Penguins before Jagr scored again. That goal at 9:15 drove Rangers goalie Kirk McLean from the game.</p>
        <p>Jagr helped the Rangers with 2:36 to play, accidentally deflecting Fleury's blast from the point past Jean-Francois Aubin. It was Fleury's second goal of the game. Kim Johnsson had also scored for the Rangers, earlier in the third period. But it was way too little, too late.</p>
        <p>''I guess in the third period, you'd have thought we were the ones who were in Japan,'' Low said, a reference to the Penguins' season-opening games in Japan last weekend.</p>
        <p>The Rangers were extremely fortunate to be trailing by only 2-1 after one period. The Penguins outshot them, 14-5.</p>
        <p>The Rangers scored first, on the power play again -- five of the Rangers' first six goals this season have come on the power play.</p>
        <p>This one came 6:43 into the contest from Messier, who was cutting in to the left-wing post. The play was set up by Valery Kamensky's pass from behind the goal line and Fleury's strong play at the right point. Fleury was pinching in on the play and kept the puck in the offensive zone.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh tied the score at 1-1 on Milan Kraft's first National Hockey League goal at 8:24 of the first period.</p>
        <p>Jagr took advantage of a Ranger line change and Jan Hrdina's screen of Sandy McCarthy just to the left of the Rangers' net, swooping around the back of the net to bounce a wrist shot off goalie McLean and into the net for a 2-1 Pittsburgh lead at 14:11 of the first period.</p>
        <p>Mike York tied the score at 2-2 at 6:41 of the second period. York won a face-off in the right circle, pulling the puck back to Johnsson at the top of the slot. Aubin turned aside Johnsson's shot, but York banged in the rebound from just off the right post for his first goal of the season. And, even though they had been outshot to that point, 19-8, the Rangers were back in the game.</p>
        <p>At 10:09, they grabbed a 3-2 lead on Fleury's first goal of the season. He cut down the slot in front of Hrdina, taking Michal Grosek's centering pass and chipping a backhander over Aubin.</p>
        <p>Jagr's one-timer from the right circle off Robert Lang's cross-ice pass tied the score at 13:53. It was his second goal of the game, coming with Petr Nedved in the penalty box. It  was the first power-play goal the Rangers had allowed after killing the first 17 power plays they had faced this season.</p>
        <p>Messier answered with a power-play goal at 15:22, just eight seconds after Darius Kasparaitis had been called for slash on Nedved. Messier won the ensuing face-off. Fleury passed to Brian Leetch, who was stopped by Aubin, even though the Penguin goaltender was screened by Adam Graves. But Messier banged the rebound home for a 4-3 Rangers lead.</p>
        <p>The Penguins were not through, however. With Messier in the penalty box for high-sticking Hrdina, Lang and  Straka worked a picture-perfect give-and-go down the left wing around Sylvain Lefebrve. Lang beat McLean at 19:07, and the teams entered the final period with the score tied at 4-4.</p>
