        <p>PICTURE one of those Saturday morning cartoons where an illustration in a book suddenly comes to life, leaping from two dimensions into three.

        <p>Rockapella brings its intricate, often riotous harmonies to Red Bank and Rahway on Friday and next Sunday in two shows for Heartstrings for Hunger, a new concert series that will raise money for the Community Food Bank of New Jersey. Whether on driving rock songs like ''Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress'' or ballads like ''Up on the Roof,'' the group's sound is such that newcomers often have trouble believing they're getting what they're seeing: five guys, no instruments.</p>

        <p>PICTURE one of those Saturday morning cartoons where an illustration in a book suddenly comes to life, leaping from two dimensions into three. That, roughly, is the sensation an uninitiated listener gets upon hearing Rockapella for the first time: the world of a cappella music, which had seemed like a calm, predictable place inhabited by barbershop and madrigal singers, suddenly is full of all sorts of new possibilities.</p>
        <p>Rockapella brings its intricate, often riotous harmonies to Red Bank and Rahway on Friday and next Sunday in two shows for Heartstrings for Hunger, a new concert series that will raise money for the Community Food Bank of New Jersey. Whether on driving rock songs like ''Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress'' or ballads like ''Up on the Roof,'' the group's sound is such that newcomers often have trouble believing they're getting what they're seeing: five guys, no instruments.</p>
        <p>''I always say that it's just a technicality that the music we make is a cappella,'' said Scott Leonard, who sings tenor and writes most of the group's original songs. ''We have all the elements of pop production -- drums, bass, rhythm tracks.''</p>
        <p>The drums come courtesy of Jeff Thacher, a vocal percussionist whose solos in concert are show-stoppers. As for the bass -- well, people who have had recent dental work attend at their own risk. On songs like ''16 Tons'' and ''60-Minute Man,'' Barry Carl hits notes so low that they could shake fillings loose. Kevin Wright and Elliott Kerman round out the group, which has been performing for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Rockapella is no secret among devotees of what is often called modern a cappella. Many others have heard the group without even knowing it -- in the theme song for ''Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?'' on PBS, in recent commercials for Folgers coffee. Mr. Leonard says the group has a large enough following now that music is a living, but a breakthrough into pop stardom remains elusive.</p>
        <p>''The accepted venues of selling an act have always been tough for us,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''We've managed to build a career without mainstream radio, without big hits, though that's always been the goal.''</p>
        <p>In concert, the group serves up a lot of familiar songs done unconventionally, but its CD's are increasingly devoted to original tunes, many dazzlingly complex. ''Rockapella has always been known as a live act,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''The songwriting is kind of catching up now.''</p>
        <p>The two Rockapella concerts are the opening installment of a series put together by Anne Dalin and Diana St. John, two New Jersey women who are trying to mold their considerable fund-raising experience into something permanent. They have recently formed Heartstrings Promotions, which is sponsoring 10 concerts in New Jersey, New York and other Eastern states over the next few months, with a portion of the ticket sales going to food banks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dalin, who lives in Edison, has been helping to organize fund-raisers for charities for a decade or more -- a math-a-thon for a Ronald McDonald House in Long Branch (with children collecting pledges for doing math problems); a sit-up-a-thon for a shelter in Edison; a book of humor by women called Creme de la Femme that benefited AIDS, breast cancer and domestic abuse causes. Ms. St. John, who lives in South Amboy, read about a concert series Ms. Dalin was organizing in New Brunswick and called her up.</p>
        <p>''We worked so well together it just kind of blossomed,'' Ms. Dalin said. Their work has included a concert last year for victims of Hurricane Floyd. That's also about the time they began thinking about making the arrangement more formal and trying to make a living out of it.</p>
        <p>The current series will also include an ambitious bill next month featuring John Gorka, Lucy Kaplansky, Alex de Grassi, Michael Manring and Will Ackerman. Then, in December, comes a holiday concert with Cherish the Ladies.</p>
        <p>This week's shows, the women pointed out, are not food drives; cash is the objective, and 10 percent of the ticket revenue will go to the charity.</p>
        <p>''Food is great,'' Ms. St. John said, ''but it takes money to run these things.''</p>
        <p>That is especially true now, said Meara Nigro, director of communications at the Community Food Bank of New Jersey, as her organization attacks the root causes of hunger with things like job training.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to do more than alleviate the immediate pangs of hunger,'' she said. ''Every little bit of money helps so that we can provide these programs.''</p>
        <p>ROCKAPELLA  Count Basie Theater, 99 Monmouth Street, Red Bank.</p>
        <p>Friday at 8 p.m.; (732) 842-9000.  Union County Arts Center, 1601 Irving Street, Rahway.  Next Sunday at 7 p.m.; (732) 499-8226.</p>
