        <p>Jennifer Gray Sliney, the daughter of Robert and Diane Sliney of Skillman, N.J., was married yesterday to Aslan Basil Cattaui, a son of Maria Livanos Cattaui of Paris and the late Stephane Cattaui. The Rev. Dr. Robert G. Stephanopoulos performed the ceremony at the Greek Orthodox Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New York.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cattaui, 28, is a legal consultant to the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. She graduated from Tufts University and received a law degree from Rutgers University. Her father is the general manager of KVK USA, a pigment manufacturer in New Brunswick, N.J. Her mother is a research associate at Kepner-Tregoe, a management consulting firm in Skillman.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 30, is the supervisor of European software consultants at the Mercator Corporation, a software and computer consulting company in Frankfurt. He graduated from Haverford College. His mother is the secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce. His father was a founder of Coges, an investment firm in Geneva.</p>
        <p>If not blind, love was blindfolded the day the couple met, in October 1996, at a Halloween party in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cattaui was dressed as D'Artagnan, the Three Musketeers' pal, and the wide brim of his hat swept over his brow, obscuring his face.</p>
        <p>The bride's face was half-covered with a mask, her head topped with a clown wig; she was dressed as one of the title characters of ''Killer Klowns From Outer Space,'' a cult science fiction film.</p>
        <p>''All I could see of her was her eyes, and that is what caught me,'' the bridegroom said.</p>
        <p>The bride said she, too, was entranced by the little she saw of Mr. Cattaui on that first meeting.</p>
        <p>''He had a sparkle in his eyes that was playful, fun and mischievous,'' she said.</p>
        <p>During their costumed exchanges they found that they both liked to snowboard and ski, and that they shared the same sense of humor. So, they decided to have dinner together four days later.</p>
        <p>She didn't know exactly what to expect when she arrived for dinner at the restaurant that evening.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't gotten a great idea of what he looked like,'' she said. ''But once I saw him, I was not at all disappointed.''</p>
