        <p>Spending on construction in New York City is expected to total $16.4 billion this year, an increase of 38 percent over 1999, when $11.9 billion was spent, according to a study of public and private construction activity commissioned by the New York Building Congress. Employment in the industry is expected to exceed 120,000 jobs, up from a total of 113,600 last year.</p>
        <p>The group said building in the city is at the highest level since the boom of the 1960's and is expected to continue at the level of $16 billion a year at least through 2003. This could lead to shortages of skilled trade workers and professionals like architects and engineers, the group warned.</p>

        <p>Spending on construction in New York City is expected to total $16.4 billion this year, an increase of 38 percent over 1999, when $11.9 billion was spent, according to a study of public and private construction activity commissioned by the New York Building Congress. Employment in the industry is expected to exceed 120,000 jobs, up from a total of 113,600 last year.</p>
        <p>The group said building in the city is at the highest level since the boom of the 1960's and is expected to continue at the level of $16 billion a year at least through 2003. This could lead to shortages of skilled trade workers and professionals like architects and engineers, the group warned.</p>
        <p>The current level of spending well exceeds the levels of the mid-1990's. Total spending in 1995 was $9.2 billion, increasing slightly in successive years to $9.9 billion and $10.5 billion and then declining to $10 billion in 1998.</p>
        <p>Residential construction is expected to add 16,000 housing units this year, up from 12,000 in 1999 and triple the number completed in the slump year of 1995. Nonresidential construction is expected to exceed 14 million square feet this year, up from 10.8 million square feet last year and 5.4 million square feet in 1995.</p>
        <p>''The city is adding jobs, residents, businesses and tourists at near record pace,'' said Richard T. Anderson, president of the congress. While the expansion is not limitless, ''the end is not yet in sight,'' he said.</p>
