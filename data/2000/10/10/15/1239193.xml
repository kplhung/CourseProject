        <p>Deborah Karrino finds and publishes some of drawings and paintings sold after her teenage sister, Karen, an artist, died in 1972 car accident; book is titled The Spirit of Children: The Art and Life of Karen Carrino; photo (By the Way column) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Karen Carrino was a 19-year-old coming into her own as an artist before she was killed in 1972 in a hit-and-run accident on the Garden State Parkway in Bloomfield. Her sister, Deborah, her brother, then 8, and a 3-year-old for whom Deborah was baby-sitting, survived. But Karen's legacy seemingly did not. Her grieving father sold most of her artwork, about 400 drawings and paintings of children, and gave the proceeds to two art students. About 10 years ago, Deborah, herself an artist specializing in tile murals, began a search for Karen's works. Her quest garnered television reports and newspaper articles (including one in this section in 1991), and drew out owners of the work from all over the country. She has managed to find 278 pieces, and has published photographs of 124 of them (including some clay sculptures) in ''The Spirit of Children: The Art and Life of Karen Carrino'' (Prometheus Books, $29). As her sister writes in the introduction: ''It feels in some way I'm doing right by Karen.''</p>
