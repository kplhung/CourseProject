        <p>THE big question bouncing around Portland real estate circles these days is, ''What building will Owen buy next?''</p>
        <p>Owen is Owen Wells, president of the Libra Foundation, a Maine-based philanthropic organization with assets estimated between $300 million and $400 million. In the last two years, Libra has purchased four prominent buildings in downtown Portland, all of them Class A office space -- the kind found in the newest, most modern buildings.</p>
        <p>Libra's latest purchase, completed on Sept. 11, is 1 Canal Plaza, a 10-story, 130,000-square-foot office building it bought from KeyCorp for $16.5 million. The deal completes Libra's acquisition of the three-building Canal Plaza complex and means the foundation now controls roughly a third of the available Class A office space in downtown Portland.</p>
        <p>The deal is another reminder of the depths of Libra's pockets and the scope of its buying power, the likes of which Maine has never seen. ''I was born here and have lived here most of my life, and I don't remember anything of this magnitude,'' said Jim Harnden, president of Ram Harnden Commercial Real Estate in Portland. ''We've had people come through and be players in smaller ways, but something like Libra is brand new for Portland and for Maine.''</p>
        <p>Libra concentrates its considerable resources solely on Maine, which means it can have a sizable impact on the state and its 1.2 million inhabitants. In Portland, a city of 65,000 that is showing new signs of economic vigor after a long dry spell starting in the early 1990's, the foundation has already left a lasting mark. Libra has given millions of dollars to cultural institutions and social organizations in the city, and in 1998 it built a $9 million public market in a marginal neighborhood on the edge of downtown in an effort to jump-start Portland's sputtering economy.</p>
        <p>Despite the good will created by its far-flung generosity, Libra's real estate deals have generated criticism from Portlanders who view the foundation as a financial King Kong, capable of dominating the market and reshaping the landscape of what remains essentially a small New England port town.</p>
        <p>Even though many of Libra's projects have received heavy publicity around the state, most of it favorable, the real estate transactions in Portland have prompted some to question both its motives and long-term strategy. ''Because Libra was set up for economic philanthropy, people expect it to be a little more public about what it's doing,'' said Mr. Harnden, who has represented other parties in deals with Libra. ''At the same time, they don't owe anybody an explanation about what they're doing. It's their own money, and Portland has benefited enormously from their investment.''</p>
        <p>Libra's strategy, according to Mr. Wells, is simple. ''The plan is to have sufficient income from real estate to generate about a third of the revenues we want to give away each year,'' he said. ''We need to give away at least 5 percent of our gross assets each year, or about $15 million. Our income from real estate is about $5 million, so we're where we want to be. We don't plan on buying any more real estate in downtown Portland.'' Libra was founded in 1989 by the Elizabeth Noyce, former wife of Robert N. Noyce, a co-inventor of the computer chip and a founder of the Intel Corporation. After the couple's divorce in the 1970's, Mrs. Noyce relocated -- with the fortune she received in the divorce settlement, including about two million shares of Intel stock -- to the 50-acre estate in Bremen, Me., where she and her husband had summered.</p>
        <p>She began giving away money, mostly to Maine charities, almost as soon as she settled into the house on Muscongus Bay. Mr. Wells became her lawyer, and together they brainstormed worthy causes around the state. ''He is the engine,'' Mrs. Noyce once said of Mr. Wells. ''I'm just the fuel.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Noyce purchased four downtown buildings of her own -- which Libra inherited when she died in 1996 -- including the building that now houses Maine Bank and Trust, a bank she started in 1991. By the time of her death, at age 65, she had given away roughly $75 million.</p>
        <p>Since its inception, Libra has given more than $19 million to a vast array of charitable and nonprofit organizations throughout Maine. Last year Libra awarded 113 grants totaling more than $6 million, with beneficiaries including a program to provide summer camp scholarships for Maine children; the local chapter of the Nature Conservancy, for the acquisition of land along the upper St. John River; and the Maine Winter Sports Center, for the creation of world-class cross country skiing and biathlon facilities in two northern Maine towns.</p>
        <p>This summer, Libra began its most ambitious project to date: the transformation of the Pineland Center, a derelict former state mental hospital 30 minutes north of Portland, into a gleaming multi-use campus that would include office space, a conference center, social service programs, working farms, a therapeutic riding facility, networks of fitness trails and more.</p>
        <p>REHABBING the site -- which includes renovating 22 aging buildings, constructing new buildings, installing new systems and generally sprucing up the property's overgrown grounds -- will cost at least $40 million. The list of prospective tenants is growing, said Mr. Wells, who hopes to begin leasing the site's commercial space next summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wells is not afraid to use terms like ''social engineering'' to describe his plans for Pineland or his vision for what Libra can accomplish in Maine. Sometimes, though, that vision meets resistance. Last year, a Libra proposal to buy land and provide money toward building a new civic center in Portland backfired, in part because some local residents thought Libra was trying to impose its agenda on a neighborhood that had not asked for its help.</p>
        <p>In other instances, the foundation's vision can be difficult to put into practice. Such is the case with the award-winning 37,000-square-foot public market, which has been criticized by city advocates as being more of an upscale destination for suburbanites than a neighborhood market and by former tenants for its steep rents and inflexibility in meeting the needs of struggling businesses.</p>
        <p>The market, which opened two years ago, recently cut its rents, however, and it is currently at full occupancy, with tenants that include an assortment of vendors selling produce, meat, seafood, flowers, wine and baked goods. Despite these developments, Mr. Wells said Libra continued to provide heavy subsidies for the market, which is probably years from supporting itself.</p>
        <p>Discussing the foundation's real estate investments, Mr. Wells said income from the office buildings provides a revenue cushion during dips in the value of Intel stock, Libra's primary asset. The foundation periodically sells Intel stock but tries to avoid being forced to sell during market downturns, such as occurred in September, when the stock fell from above $70 a share to about $40. ''We're not going to sell the stock, because we know it's going to perform over the long term,'' he said. But, acknowledging the recent sharp decline, he added, ''It's not for the faint of heart.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wells stressed that Libra maintains and improves its properties and that rents are at or below market rate, about $19 per square foot a year for Class A space. Additionally, he said, Libra pays taxes on all of its properties, which will amount to nearly $1 million in 2001.</p>
        <p>Some of the grumbling over Libra's purchases is doubtless the result of a strong local market and low vacancy rates -- 3 percent currently for Class A and 6 percent over all, down from 23 percent in the early 1990's -- which mean few buildings come up for sale. Some of it also stems from Libra's dominance in the market; Libra owns close to 500,000 square feet out of a total of roughly 1.4 million square feet of downtown's Class A commercial space.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wells says he is sometimes mystified by Libra's critics. ''The Libra Foundation represents an unprecedented opportunity for Maine,'' Mr. Wells said. ''The fact that we can send 5,000 kids to summer camp is phenomenal. We can try new things, experiment, see if they work. I think we actually do a very good job of getting our mission out there.</p>
        <p>''Other foundations might not get criticized the way we do, but they're just giving money away. We're activists, after all.''</p>
