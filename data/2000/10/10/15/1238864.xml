        <p>ANDREW PISELLI is living every chef's dream. After working in the kitchens of others (Fishermen's Catch in Point Lookout and Newport Grill in Garden City) he now has a place of his own. Along with his partner, Darlene Barone, he opened Josie's last summer.</p>
        <p>The appealing Long Beach storefront is named for his late grandmother. (Is this a trend? I've visited two restaurants in as many weeks honoring owners' grandmothers.) The cover of the menu here is a 1930's photograph of a smiling, young Josie, complete with marcelled hair.</p>
        <p>The decor at Josie's would make any grandmother blink. It's the antithesis of the light and airy look most new Long Island restaurants feature. Walls and ceiling are black, as are tablecloths. The cave-like room is dotted with high-backed, jewel-toned velvet banquettes. Each table jumps from the darkness with a fat red candle in a wrought-iron holder and napkins in a rainbow of colors. Large, modern paintings of 20th-century celebrities, like Albert Einstein and Stevie Wonder, brighten the walls.</p>
        <p>The menu also has flair. Every dish is a well-thought-out composition with exciting accompaniments, which vary from plate to plate. Fish make an especially fine showing. Leading the school is lightly cooked salmon with crispy skin set over a smashing shaved fennel and white bean salad sparked by pancetta and segments of orange. Mouth-tingling Cajun sea trout arrives atop a refreshing red onion-tomato salad, and pan-roasted sea bass makes the scene with a yummy hash of crisp potato cubes and assorted wild mushrooms. Another recommended pick is the deftly fried flounder with basil crust placed on a corn-chickpea-tomato succotash.</p>
        <p>My favorites among the meats were the crisp herb-roasted half chicken escorted by mashed potatoes, a thatch of wispy onion rings and a delicious lemon-garlic brown sauce, and a lamb creation that paired rosy-pink chops from a roasted rack and slices from a braised leg.  The beef fillet, medium-rare are ordered, with crisp potato cake and garlicky spinach accompaniments also made points. The person who ordered the medallions of pork was very happy with them, but I was surprised to find the meat enclosed in thick breading. The menu gave no hint of it.</p>
        <p>Appetizers have a more checkered success rate. The top-rated pick is the pan-seared sea scallops, three jumbos mated with a mound of crunchy carrot-cumin slaw. Nearly as special was the appetizer of mushroom raviolis. This winner had light, nearly paper-thin pasta and a brown sauce loaded with luscious wild mushrooms. Rare tuna over braised artichoke hearts also made a good impression. And don't miss the onion soup. This is the classic. It is as good as it gets with sweet caramelized onions, a rich broth spiked with port and a very light glaze of cheese.</p>
        <p>The also-rans were not failures but each had a flaw: the zucchini flowers, stuffed with crab meat, breaded and fried francese-style, were overwhelmed by a too-assertive beurre blanc; goat cheese was a too-dominant player in the eggplant Napoleon; and the house salad sported a sherry vinaigrette that was unexpectedly creamy. I loved the grilled figs wrapped in pancetta, stuffed with Gorgonzola and paired with salad, but the portion was skimpy: two very tiny pieces of fruit.</p>
        <p>There were only three desserts offered, but all came up aces: a warm blueberry crisp with vanilla ice cream, a slice from a rich chocolate terrine and a light ricotta beignet, very crisp, with a white chocolate dipping sauce.</p>
        <p>Service was speedy and attentive, but our waitress was a bit too casual when dealing with a patron's food allergies. She assured us that the blueberry crisp contained no nuts. She claimed she checked with the chef. If so, the chef lied to her.</p>
        <p>Josie's serves cappuccino and espresso (regular or decaffeinated) but it may be the only restaurant on Long Island that does not offer regular or decaffeinated coffee.</p>
        <p>Josie's  232 West Park Avenue, Long Beach, (516) 897-3600.</p>
