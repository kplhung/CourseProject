        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''How to Recruit Police Officers'' (editorial, Oct. 9) blames the New York City Police Department for a  shortage of candidates. But traditionally, young people were attracted to police work by friends, relatives and others who showed them that it is an honorable profession. But with morale so low, few veterans now urge young people to join.</p>
        <p>One problem is the depersonalization, caused partly by a philosophy that says statistics tell the whole story and individual officers are fungible. After the Knapp Commission on corruption in the 1970's, there was an effort to humanize the job, with ''ethical awareness'' workshops and ''venting'' sessions. Our common enemies were crime and cynicism. Now everything is based on statistics.</p>
        <p>With about 41,000 officers, most of us feel as if we are working for a conglomerate, but without the appropriate pay.</p>
        <p>New York police have sharply  reduced serious crime, but instead of celebrating success, most officers feel as if they are on a treadmill  with only two goals: retirement and pension.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL J. GORMAN  Whitestone, Queens, Oct. 9, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a New York City police lieutenant and a lawyer.</p>
