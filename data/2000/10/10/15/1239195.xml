        <p>The election next month may be focused on the presidential and Senate races, but New Yorkers are also choosing many local officeholders, including 14 members of Congress, 25 state senators, 51 State Assembly members and dozens of state and county judges.</p>
        <p>To help voters narrow the choices, the Open Society Institute and other nonprofit groups have created savvyvoter.org, a Web site that tracks local races, offers unfiltered statements from candidates and provides background on a range of voter's concerns.</p>
        <p>The goal of savvyvoter.org is to provide free and unbiased information to help voters make an informed decision, said Joshua Schaff, its project director. The site is both a public service project and a continuing initiative by the Open Society, which was founded by the philanthropist George Soros, to change the system of financing campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaff said the aim of the site was to level a playing field made unfair by the cost of television advertisements. ''It takes a major hurdle out of the election process,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The site, which had a trial run in 1998, also plans to offer coverage of next year's City Council races, when most of the seats will be up for grabs under new term-limit rules.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- Undecided voters can review candidates by clicking on Races or by entering their ZIP code or a candidate's name. Each race is summarized in a grid according to candidate and issue. Clicking on any of the marked issues brings up the candidate's position, as well as links to an opponent's rebuttal.</p>
        <p>Other sections of the site include Discuss, a collection of message boards moderated by Brian Lehrer, a host of WNYC radio, and Issues, which offers general explanation of topics.</p>
        <p>LINKS -- Election-related links include online voter registration, state and city Board of Elections and advocacy groups on various issues. The site also links to candidates' home pages, branches of local, state and federal governments and archives of previous elections. Political junkies can also click on ''news forum'' to follow poll results and read election coverage from local and national news outlets.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET -- A neutral and open platform for candidates to elaborate on their sound bites.</p>
