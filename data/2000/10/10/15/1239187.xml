        <p>After pieces of a huge meteorite fell on the frozen surface of Tagish Lake in British Columbia last January, Jim Brook, who lived in a nearby cabin, collected the black fragments and kept them in a freezer. Scientists who analyzed the material now say it is the most important meteorite discovery in the last 30 years. The meteorite, a rare or new type of carbonaceous chondrites, appears to be the oldest and most pristine extraterrestrial material yet found. It may well bear clues about the early solar system and the origin of life.</p>
