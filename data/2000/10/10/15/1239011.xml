        <p>The comedian Richard Belzer was sitting in the kitchen of the Hilton Hotel in Midtown working out some jokes for the Friars Club roast of Rob Reiner. The material was about as sharp as a bowling ball. But still, he was laughing at it.</p>
        <p>The ice machine was leaking nearby, and a waiter was pacing back and forth mumbling loudly into a walkie-talkie.</p>
        <p>''Come in, Captain Constant,'' the waiter said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Belzer looked annoyed.</p>
        <p>Again, ''Captain Constant, come in.''</p>
        <p>The comedian looked up. He was wearing sunglasses and the lighting was dim.</p>
        <p>Another waiter named Ping-Pong came by, pushing a silver tea service on a rolling cart draped in a table cloth. The cloth was stained with gravy.</p>
        <p>''Come in, Captain Constant!''</p>
        <p>The waiter did not see when Captain Constant walked up behind him. Captain Constant was wearing a blue suit. He hollered in the waiter's ear and the waiter slipped in the water. He told the waiter to get up, shut up and get to work.</p>
        <p>''Can't you see the ice machine is leaking?''</p>
        <p>The waiter got a mop and muttered under his breath while he worked.</p>
        <p>''Fuggedaboudit,'' Ping-Pong said to him in a thick dialect as he came in through the swinging doors without the filthy cart.</p>
        <p>Carl Reiner walked by just then, stepping out into the ballroom where the cameras were waiting for his picture.</p>
        <p>Ping-Pong was impressed. ''Wow, he really is a meat loaf. A big old meat loaf.''</p>
        <p>It was the funniest line of the evening.</p>
        <p>The ''RO@$T!'' (as it is officially known) was filmed for cable television, and this has ruined the whole thing, since the jokes have to be prettied up and dulled down so as not to offend the viewers. Tradition has it that the humor is supposed to have the charm of an unflushed toilet, but the old Scotch-stained comedians like Milton Berle and Don Rickles did not show.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that the evening did not have its lines. Alan King was there drinking gin and adjusting himself every few minutes.</p>
        <p>''You wanna know something about drinking?'' he said. ''I used to write for Jackie Gleason. One time before he goes out on stage, he drinks a big whiskey. I said, 'Jackie you always drink before a show?' He says, 'Kid, I never go out alone.' ''</p>
        <p>Freddie Roman is a funny man. He jumped out of the green room for a quick snort and three drags on a smoke. He craned his neck as Lola Pagnani, the well-endowed Italian starlet, drifted by like a Greek freighter.</p>
        <p>''My wife doesn't like it when I talk to the young girls. I say what's she want me to do? Talk to the young boys?''</p>
        <p>Rim shot.</p>
        <p>Vanilla Ice was wandering around willing to hold anyone's drink who was willing to talk to him. He drank Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola with plenty of ice, and he wore a braided goatee.</p>
        <p>''The good thing about drinking is that it feels good,'' he said. ''The bad thing is that the morning comes and it's over.''</p>
        <p>''Just like his career,'' someone said.</p>
