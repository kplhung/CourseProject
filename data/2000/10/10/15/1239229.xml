        <p>The New York State Education Department released the results of statewide tests in reading and mathematics last week, and the news was mixed. Scores climbed slightly on the eighth-grade math test, but dropped on the fourth-grade math and eighth-grade reading tests. Most eighth graders still failed to meet the new state standards.</p>
        <p>Forty percent of eighth graders across the state met the math standards, an improvement from 38 percent in 1999. In reading, 45 percent met the standards, down from 48 percent.</p>

        <p>The New York State Education Department released the results of statewide tests in reading and mathematics last week, and the news was mixed. Scores climbed slightly on the eighth-grade math test, but dropped on the fourth-grade math and eighth-grade reading tests. Most eighth graders still failed to meet the new state standards.</p>
        <p>Forty percent of eighth graders across the state met the math standards, an improvement from 38 percent in 1999. In reading, 45 percent met the standards, down from 48 percent.</p>
        <p>The results for Westchester County were only slightly more encouraging. Eighth-grade math scores were identical to last year's, with 51 percent of students meeting the standards. But reading scores dropped, with 56 percent of eighth graders meeting the standards, compared with 59 percent last year.</p>
        <p>Fourth graders fared better statewide, with 65 percent meeting state standards in math. But that was a decline from last year, when 67 percent met the math standards. Fourth graders in Westchester performed slightly better than last year: 78 percent met the standards, up from 77 percent.</p>
        <p>What follows are the scores for public schools with a fourth grade or eighth grade in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>ABBY GOODNOUGH</p>
        <p>NUMBER TESTED -- The number of students who took each test.</p>
        <p>PERFORMANCE LEVELS -- Percentage of students in each category. Levels are ranked from 1 to 4. Students at Levels 1 and 2 fall below the standards, with those at Level 1 having serious deficiencies, and those at Level 2 needing extra help. Students at Levels 3 and 4 meet the standards. Those at Level 3 are on track to meet the state's high school graduation requirements, and those at Level 4 perform at consistently high levels.</p>
        <p>PERCENTAGE MEETING STANDARDS -- The total percentage of students who scored at Levels 3 or 4 in 2000 and 1999.</p>
        <p>CHANGE FROM LAST YEAR -- Total change in the percentage of students who scored at Levels 3 or 4 this year compared with 1999.</p>
        <p>Blanks indicate missing data. District and county summaries were calculated from individual school data provided by the state. Tables include all schools for which the state provided data. Data for some schools were not available.</p>
