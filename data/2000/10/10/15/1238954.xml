        <p>PRESERVING, once a necessary activity for stocking the larder as the growing season wound down, has now become recreation. There is unquestionable delight in dipping into a jar of homemade jam at breakfast or opening a container of well-spiced chutney that did not come from a store to serve with roast duck or pork. And when good-looking seasonal apples or pears beckon from a farm stand, why not preserve them to use in myriad recipes?</p>
        <p>''Sensational Preserves'' by Hilaire Walden (Conran Octopus, $19.95) provides everything but the raw materials for indulging in such treats. The stunningly photographed book begins with the basics you need to know for making all sorts of fruit and vegetable preserves, like simple strawberry jam, tomato relish, spiced vinegar and pickled limes. Some recipes for using the preserves are also included.</p>

And when good-looking seasonal apples or pears beckon from a farm stand, why not preserve them to use in myriad recipes?</p>
        <p>''Sensational Preserves'' by Hilaire Walden (Conran Octopus, $19.95) provides everything but the raw materials for indulging in such treats. The stunningly photographed book begins with the basics you need to know for making all sorts of fruit and vegetable preserves, like simple strawberry jam, tomato relish, spiced vinegar and pickled limes. Some recipes for using the preserves are also included.</p>
        <p>The book was first published in England. Though the metric measures are converted for American cooks, many ingredients, like sugar, are given in pounds and ounces instead of in cups, so having a kitchen scale is a good idea.</p>
        <p>Cranberry Ketchup  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2 pounds cranberries</p>
        <p>1/2 pound onions, chopped</p>
        <p>2/3 cup white-wine vinegar  1 1/2 cups sugar  1 teaspoon salt  6 whole allspice  4 cloves  10 black peppercorns  1 cinnamon stick.</p>
        <p>1. Put cranberries, onions and a cup and a fourth of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer gently about 10 minutes, until cranberries split and soften and the onion is tender. Puree in food mill or processor. If food processor is used, mixture must then be sieved to remove skins.</p>
        <p>2. Return puree to clean saucepan and add vinegar, sugar and salt. Tie spices in a piece of cheesecloth and add to pan. Heat gently, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil and simmer about 15 minutes until mixture is the consistency of sour cream and there is no excess liquid.</p>
        <p>3. Remove spice bag and transfer ketchup to one or more clean canning jars or plastic containers. Process jars in boiling water bath and seal, or refrigerate containers. Wait three weeks before using.  Yield: 4 cups.</p>
        <p>This and the next two recipes were adapted from ''Sensational Preserves.''</p>
        <p>Spiced Pineapple Chutney  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon cardamom seeds  2 pineapples, about a pound and a half each, peeled and well trimmed of ''eyes''</p>
        <p>1/2 cup white-wine vinegar  1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  2 teaspoons curry powder</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</p>
        <p>7/8 cup sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Toast cardamom seeds by putting them in a heavy skillet over low heat about a minute, stirring, until fragrant. Remove seeds and crush in mortar. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Quarter pineapples lengthwise, remove core and chop flesh fairly fine, taking care to collect any juice.</p>
        <p>3. Put juice from pineapple in saucepan with vinegar, ground cardamom, cinnamon, curry powder, ginger and cloves. Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer gently for five minutes. Add pineapple and simmer about 20 minutes, until tender. Stir in sugar until it dissolves. Increase heat and boil, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thick and there is no excess liquid, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Transfer chutney to clean canning jars or plastic containers. Process jars in boiling water bath and seal, or refrigerate plastic containers. Wait a month before using.  Yield: 3 cups.</p>
        <p>Prune and Raisin Conserve  Total time: 45 minutes plus overnight marinating</p>
        <p>1 1/4 pound prunes, halved and pitted  12 ounces raisins  4 ounces dried figs or pitted dates, chopped  2 1/4 cups freshly made hot Earl Grey tea  1 cup, packed, dark brown sugar  Zest and juice of 1 orange  Juice of 1 lemon  2 cloves</p>
        <p>1/2 cup walnut halves  4 tablespoons dark rum.</p>
        <p>1. Put prunes, raisins and figs or dates in bowl. Pour tea over, cover and allow to steep overnight.</p>
        <p>2. Put sugar in ovenproof bowl, put in oven or toaster oven, turn heat to lowest setting and warm sugar for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer dried fruit mixture to saucepan, add brown sugar, orange zest and juice, lemon juice and cloves. Heat gently, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil and simmer about 12 minutes, to 220 degrees on a candy thermometer.</p>
        <p>4. Remove pan from heat, stir in walnuts and rum and transfer to clean canning jars or clean plastic containers. Process jars in boiling water bath and seal, or store containers in refrigerator. Best allowed to ripen several days before serving.  Yield: 7 cups.</p>
