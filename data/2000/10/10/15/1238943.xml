        <p>Less than a month remains before a successor to President Clinton is chosen and begins to assemble a new government, yet an appearance here by the president 10 days ago was enough to touch off a feud among two professors. The dust-up spilled into print only after two opinion pieces were withheld from publication in The Daily Princetonian.</p>
        <p>The editors of the student newspaper had planned to publish two articles the day the president came here to speak at a conference on the progressive era in America: one by Sean Wilentz, a professor of history at the university who was a staunch supporter of Mr. Clinton during his impeachment ordeal, and another by Robert George, a professor of jurisprudence who is a vehement critic of the president.</p>
        <p>In the end, neither was published in The Daily Princetonian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilentz withdrew his article after learning it was to appear the same day as a counterpoint to a column by Mr. George.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Wilentz withdrew his column, the editors of The Princetonian chose not to publish Mr. George's piece either.</p>
        <p>''We felt caught between these two professors, and we felt the fairest thing was to scrap the whole thing and to wash our hands completely,'' said Richard Just, editor-in-chief of The Princetonian.</p>
        <p>Stung by the decision, Mr. George instead offered his article to the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal, which published the column on the day after the conference with a one-paragraph introduction by the editors saying that planners of the conference, after learning that The Princetonian was going to publish a piece critical of the President, had prevailed upon the student newspaper not to print Mr. George's column.</p>
        <p>Then last Monday, The Daily Princetonian published an editorial criticizing both Professor Wilentz for withdrawing his column and The Wall Street Journal for not contacting either the paper or Mr. Wilentz before accusing the editors of withdrawing  an article for political reasons.</p>
        <p>''The substance of the introduction was based on what Professor George told us,'' Richard Tofel, a vice president of corporate communications for Dow Jones and Company, said last week in a telephone interview. ''We had no reason to doubt him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tofel confirmed that editors had not contacted Mr. Wilentz or any editors at The Princetonian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilentz, who helped organize the conference, said in an interview that editors at The Princetonian had asked him weeks before the conference to write an article to coincide with the president's visit. He wrote a brief scholarly introduction to the Progressive era -- a period in the early 1900's marked by social and political reforms. Mr. Wilentz mentioned President Clinton only to note that he was speaking on that day and that the president considered this a potential new age of Progressive politics.</p>
        <p>''The occasion was an academic one, not a political one,'' Mr. Wilentz said. ''To write a political piece would compromise the spirit of the occasion.''</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Wilentz learned two days before the president's visit about the student newspaper's plan for a point-counterpoint format between him and Mr. George -- who considers himself the most outspoken critic of Mr. Clinton on the Princeton faculty -- Mr. Wilentz withdrew his piece. At that point, the paper told Mr. George that his article was not needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. George said in an interview that he suspected foul play after he saw an article in The Princetonian on Thursday -- the day of Mr. Clinton's visit -- by Jason Brownlee, a graduate student in politics, contending  that Mr. Clinton would be the perfect choice to succeed Harold Shapiro as the next president of the university.</p>
        <p>Mr. George said he had contacted The Wall Street Journal only after receiving no response to an e-mail he sent to Dana Roper, a senior editor at The Princetonian, asking for some clarification of the situation. Editors at the student paper said in an interview that they had indeed received Professor George's message and had had not responded.</p>
        <p>With that, Mr. George turned to The Wall Street Journal and wrote in the column that Mr. Clinton was ''an unprincipled and deeply dishonorable man.''</p>
        <p>Later, in an interview, he said of Mr. Clinton's appearance here: ''The president's visit was inescapably political. And particularly so in an election year when he is raising tens of millions of dollars -- maybe more than $100 million -- for his party and for candidates he supports including his vice president. I don't think they should have let any action on the part of Professor Wilentz dictate the breach of an agreement with me to publish as agreed.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Wilentz said: ''Neither I nor any other organizer prevailed upon The Princetonian to do anything, nor would we think them susceptible to such pressure. It is an outright falsehood.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to The Princetonian, which appeared last Tuesday, Mr. Wilentz wrote that he had invited Mr. George to be a guest at the conference, but that Mr. George had not accepted. ''Instead,'' he said, ''he chose to tell a false story to The Wall Street Journal. He did not talk to me at any point before or after the conference nor did the Journal contact me to ascertain the facts. I have no idea what Professor George's motivation was.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Just, the editor-in-chief of The Daily Princetonian, he summed up the situation this way: ''My decision was not influenced in any way by what might have happened in the planning committee. It appeared to us that there was some sort of feud going on that was larger than the Prince and I didn't want to be caught in the middle of that. My decision was that we needed to get disinvolved from this completely.''</p>
