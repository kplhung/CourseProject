        <p>More than 400,000 people have registered the serial numbers of five million bills, worth a total of more than $33 million, at the Web site www.wheresgeorge.com. Each bill is marked with the site's address -- O.K. so long as the bill is not rendered useless -- and then spent with the hope that subsequent possessors will visit the site and register the bill again, providing a fossil-like record (gaps included) of its movements.</p>
        <p>One Dollar Bill  Serial No. D0759 -- 2K, Series: 1995. Distributed by the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank.  Aug. 18, 1999, Dayton, Ohio: ''Brand new bill. Stamped, circled serial number and wrote on top front.''  Sept. 25, 1999, Middletown, Ohio: ''Received this bill at Kwik N Kold Drive Thru in West Chester, Ohio.''  Nov. 24, 1999, Lexington, Ky.: ''At an auto parts place, condition of bill is fair. Wrinkled and a bit torn.''  Nov. 29, 1999, Richmond, Ky.: ''Received it as payment for merchandise. It is getting old!!''  Dec. 11, 1999, Henderson, Nev.: ''George came from Kentucky and landed in Las Vegas, where he will depart on 12/13/99.''  Dec. 30, 1999, Sun City, Ariz.  May 2, 2000, Athens, Ohio: ''George is in good condition here in Bitterfeld (near Leipzig), Germany. Had to cheat the ZIP code, since it wouldn't accept one from Germany.''  July 24, 2000, Delhi, N.Y.</p>
