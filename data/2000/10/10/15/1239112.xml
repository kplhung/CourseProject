        <p>THE Israelis and Palestinians are now being pulled violently toward the black hole of their conflict. They have been there before -- a place so dense in passion that it emits no light by which they can truly see the other's legitimacy as a people. If they get there again, despite the summit convened for Monday, they will be back at the core of the battle. For this has always been a clash of two nationalisms, not two states, trying to defy the law of physics by occupying the same space at the same time.</p>
        <p>The problem was visible a few weeks after the 1993 Oslo accords that launched the peace process, when nine Palestinian teenagers gathered in a West Bank classroom to reconsider their attitudes toward Israeli Jews. Born and raised in the cauldron of Israeli occupation, they now faced a confusing moment of hopeful skepticism. Seeping into the negative stereotypes were new, admiring images. Israeli Jews were violent but also educated, the students said, controlling but industrious, morally corrupt but more protective than Arabs of women's rights.</p>
        <p>On one point, however, the ambivalence evaporated. The Jews, said a high school senior named Fahed, had faked their ancient history in Jerusalem and surroundings. ''They created the ruins to prove that it was their land,'' he declared. None of his classmates laughed at him; none disagreed. The Jews don't belong here, a girl added.</p>
        <p>Did that mean the Jews should leave, they were asked. The answer came in a chorus: ''No!''</p>
        <p>''Israelis don't have any other place to go,'' another girl conceded.</p>
        <p>This was not just a children's story. It revealed the adult blend of realism and fantasy that still drives the struggle. Conceding that the Israelis are there to stay does not overcome the power of denying their historical right to do so. Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian Authority, and Hosni Mubarak, president of Egypt, have reportedly made private remarks dismissing Jews' ties to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, where the Second Temple stood until destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. The denial touches the deepest Israeli fear, reinforced during the current clashes, that no peace agreement will render them authentic inhabitants in the eyes of the Arabs.</p>
        <p>''Arafat can't even acknowledge that the Temple was there,'' said Rabbi David Hartman, who teaches tolerance in Jerusalem. ''He denies my whole historical memory. What I want Arafat to say is that the Jews have come home. If someone makes me feel at home I can feel secure and welcome others.''</p>
        <p>That level of understanding has evidently not been developed by seven years of intricate negotiation and compromise, which were supposed to build confidence and trust. Instead, Palestinians have endured a similar sense of homelessness. Even after gaining authority over parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, they could barely move about without encountering the flashpoints of Israeli roadblocks and Israeli settlements defended by Israeli troops.</p>
        <p>''If you were in Gaza you would feel the sense of occupation,'' Ziad Abu-Amr, a Palestinian legislator, said in a telephone conversation from his home there. ''Frustration and anger have been internalized on the part of the Palestinians as well as the Israelis. Palestinian society enjoyed much less from the peace process and the agreements than the Israelis did.''</p>
        <p>Trust was undermined when the right-wing Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu built more Jewish settlements and dragged its feet on carrying out commitments to relinquish territory. Scattered throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the settlements have succeeded in restricting Israel's flexibility in deploying troops and giving up land, and they seem destined to inflame Palestinians unless an Israeli government dismantles them.</p>
        <p>The Oslo process, with its superstructure of diplomatic contracts, may have been appropriate for negotiating state-to-state treaties like those Israel achieved with Egypt and Jordan. But this competition between two nationalisms requires something more pervasive that reaches further down into the schools and streets.</p>
        <p>''When the populations live among each other and are intertwined, it cannot be only a process among politicians,'' said Seth Appel, an Israeli who helped develop educational programs to promote Arab-Jewish understanding. ''It has to be a process among people themselves. Until people themselves make reconciliation, the peace process will not be successful.''</p>
        <p>Such programs flourished more in Israel than in Palestinian areas, and they preached mainly to the choir, leaving out most people who needed them. Only recently, after 50 years of statehood, has Israel felt able to begin teaching its own history honestly enough to acknowledge the victimization of Palestinians. For now, at least, Palestinians, still engaged in nation-building, cannot seem to define themselves without denigrating Israelis; their textbooks have remained mostly unrevised, much of their media vitriolic in tone.</p>
        <p>Still, the peace process did change attitudes. The notion of sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem, which has been offered to Mr. Arafat by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, was anathema to virtually all Israelis until recently. The Palestinian goal of statehood used to get practically no support in Israel. Even amid the rioting last week, Ariel Sharon, the leader of the rightist Likud, reiterated his conditional acceptance of a Palestinian state. In the 1980's, Mr. Sharon vigorously created scores of Jewish settlements to establish what he called ''facts on the ground'' that would preclude Israel's withdrawal. The Palestinians have now created their own facts on the ground.</p>
        <p>The violence has been especially shocking to Israelis who believed that Palestinians' thinking had evolved as much as their own. Religious suspicions, for example, proved more powerful than the Barak government may have realized when it approved Mr. Sharon's explosive visit to the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif, which is holy in both Judaism and Islam. Muslims have long feared a Jewish takeover, despite Israel's firm policy of leaving the site in Muslim hands.</p>
        <p>These emotions have been heightened as the negotiations have drawn closer to the hardest issues, including the fate of Jerusalem. Since religion and nationalism there are fused and their symbols interchangeable, the current upheaval has naturally targeted religious sites. Palestinian police failed to defend a Jewish holy place known as Joseph's Tomb from Palestinian mobs whose televised desecration of Hebrew texts was seen throughout Israel; the Palestinian Authority knew enough to begin repairs promptly. Joshua's Tomb was also targeted but protected by the Israeli army, and a Byzantine synagogue was torched in Jericho. Jewish mobs attacked Muslim sites inside Israel, including a mosque in Tiberias.</p>
        <p>Yet clashes in the Middle East have a way of confounding the most reasonable expectations. The 1967 war brought Israel both triumph and a hostile Palestinian population on contested territory. Israel's near defeat in 1973 emboldened Egypt's president, Anwar el-Sadat, to sign the first Arab-Israeli peace treaty. Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon displaced the Palestine Liberation Organization, which then learned new methods watching Lebanese Muslims use guerrilla tactics effectively against Israeli troops. The intifada, or uprising, that began in 1987 brought Israel into a posture of compromise with the P.L.O., which produced relations with several Arab countries.</p>
        <p>IF that counterintuitive pattern is repeated, some believe the current convulsions could force rethinking and introduce new fluidity into the peace process. Bargaining occurs not only at the table but also in the street, observed Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University. ''When they shoot and throw stones, it's also part of the process,'' he said. Since there is no military solution, he added, ''you do not come to the peace process because you have faith in peace or you have faith in humanity, but because there is no alternative.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, when Israelis see two of their soldiers stabbed and beaten to death in Ramallah, when they see a Palestinian assailant gleefully hold up his blood-soaked hands for the mobs to cheer, even the notion that there is no alternative can vanish, at least temporarily. When Israel replies by rocketing Palestinian buildings, it seems to be drawing from the playbook that was effective years ago in deterring Egypt, Jordan and Syria from permitting terrorists to use their territory. When your enemies live just down the street, however, it's a different problem that requires a different solution. Recognizing the authenticity of the other in that land comes hard in the midst of the conflict. Yet the conflict cannot end without that recognition.</p>
        <p>A cruel twist on this cycle has been inflicted on Arab citizens of Israel during the upheaval . Long subjected to discrimination, they have been ambivalent about their identities and never before were involved in such large-scale rioting. But now mobs of Israeli Arabs and Jews have stoned each other. Roaming bands of Jews have attacked Arabs' cars, tried to break into an Arab legislator's house and set fire to Arab-owned businesses. They firebombed a Tel Aviv restaurant where they thought Arabs might be working or dining. Worse, the police have shot and killed Israeli Arab demonstrators while allegedly treating Jewish demonstrators less harshly. Some Arabs say that this has erased the border between Israel and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a new era,'' said Lufty Mashour, an Arab who is editor in chief of the Nazareth newspaper As-Sennar. ''We have no legitimacy at all. Nobody wants us to be part of the state. The state is declared and administered and directed as the state of the Jews, not as the state of all its citizens.''</p>
        <p>The Arabs and the Jews cannot escape from one another. ''The two nations are going to continue living together,'' Mayor Ramez Jaraisi of Nazareth told a reporter last week. ''The question is how. There will be coexistence. The question is what kind of coexistence.''</p>
