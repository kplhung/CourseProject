        <p>Jeff Rogers, 18, dropped out of high school last winter and worked to get his G.E.D. Theoretically, he's saving to go to college, but saving doesn't come easy. He recently got a job at Crystal's, a shoe store in Boston, where his first check netted him $201. The money went fast.</p>
        <p>Because he has no bank account, Jeff went to a check-cashing place that charged him a 1 percent fee. After that, he paid his chief expense, the $95 monthly bill to insure his car -- a 1983 four-door Dodge Aries, handed down to him from his disabled grandmother. Over the past six months, Jeff invested about $400 in repairs, but it still failed inspection. He drives it anyway, because the car guarantees independence. ''With a car, you can run 10 errands in one day,'' he says. ''Taking the bus, you can run four, so that's not saving you any money.''</p>

        <p>Jeff Rogers, 18, dropped out of high school last winter and worked to get his G.E.D. Theoretically, he's saving to go to college, but saving doesn't come easy. He recently got a job at Crystal's, a shoe store in Boston, where his first check netted him $201. The money went fast.</p>
        <p>Because he has no bank account, Jeff went to a check-cashing place that charged him a 1 percent fee. After that, he paid his chief expense, the $95 monthly bill to insure his car -- a 1983 four-door Dodge Aries, handed down to him from his disabled grandmother. Over the past six months, Jeff invested about $400 in repairs, but it still failed inspection. He drives it anyway, because the car guarantees independence. ''With a car, you can run 10 errands in one day,'' he says. ''Taking the bus, you can run four, so that's not saving you any money.''</p>
        <p>To celebrate his first paycheck from the new job, Jeff joined a video store and rented $12 worth of movies, including ''The Princess Bride'' and ''Labyrinth.'' He also bought two bags of Cheez Doodles and a Coke for $1.55. Jeff only drinks Coke and Pepsi. ''I don't drink water,'' he says. ''That stuff falls from the sky.'' He brought his work clothes to a dry cleaner (if he dresses like a slob, Jeff says, he'll have trouble making sales) that required him to invest in $20 worth of coupons up front. Add to these costs his other regular expenses -- $13 a month for pager service, $30 a month for an M.B.T.A. pass to travel to and from work (he drives his car to the subway station and rides from there), $10 a week for gas, $5 a day on fast food (he skips breakfast and eats dinner at home with his parents in Dorchester) -- and Jeff's check is gone.</p>
        <p>Which proved a problem, since Jeff was already in debt to his father from the week before. His friend Calvin was getting married, and Jeff, as best man, organized the bachelor party. He had to borrow from his dad in order to treat Calvin right. There wouldn't be a traditional bachelor party, Jeff joked, since the only strippers he could afford were the kind who have lost their teeth. So he and Calvin and two friends hit a video arcade, where Jeff spent $20, and then headed to an opening-night performance of ''The Original Kings of Comedy.'' Jeff treated Calvin to the movie -- the tickets cost $18 -- and he smuggled in $50 worth of Alize, a fruity liquor. The tuxedo cost $120 to rent, and Jeff gave Calvin $140 in cash as a gift. All told, Calvin's wedding put him $348 in the hole with his dad. He figures that it will take him about five months to pay it off, assuming nothing else goes wrong.</p>
        <p>But this is a risky assumption when you're keeping a car like Jeff's on the road. By the start of Week 2 at his job, Jeff had been given a parking ticket (''I stopped by work for one minute and got a ticket. I was like, Please baby, don't. It was 30 bones''), and then his brakes gave out, leaving him stranded. The tow cost only $10, thanks to his mom's AAA membership. But the estimated repairs could be up to $1,200. So now Jeff is keeping up the insurance payments and remaining philosophical. ''Right now,'' he says, ''saving is a luxury I can't afford. Eventually I'll be able to save. Maybe only $100 or so a month. Not much, but something.'' As a reminder of just how hard that will be, Jeff still has his parking ticket. ''I'll be paying it at the deadline,'' he says, ''like I pay everything.''</p>
