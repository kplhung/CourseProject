        <p>IN the last six weeks, more than $1.3 trillion has been stripped from the market capitalization of the Nasdaq composite index. That is just a bit less than a whole year's worth of economic output in Britain. Perfidious Albion indeed.</p>
        <p>While there are tumbling technology stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, too -- Lucent Technologies and Texas Instruments come to mind -- the Nasdaq's meltdown is a pretty good proxy for the state of the technology sector in general.</p>
        <p>Is this a bad dream, or a new reality?  Thomas F. Marsico, portfolio manager at Marsico Capital Management, took time last week to talk about technology, change and growth. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. -- You started moving money out of technology stocks at the start of the year. What concerned you then?</p>
        <p>A. -- Valuations, first of all.</p>
        <p>We found valuations to have been stretched in three main areas: cellular handsets, companies reliant on Internet advertising and companies involved in personal computers.</p>
        <p>The universe we are talking about in the first area includes companies like Nokia, Qualcomm, Ericsson and Motorola. Stocks like DoubleClick and Yahoo are in the second group. And Intel, Microsoft and Dell are in the third group.</p>
        <p>We didn't own either DoubleClick or Yahoo. We did own Qualcomm and had a smaller position in Ericsson. And we have owned Intel, Microsoft and Dell.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Do you have fundamental concerns about companies in these areas?</p>
        <p>A. -- There are changes going on that are impacting these companies.</p>
        <p>In the telecom area, there is a shift from circuit-based to optical switching. Second, there is a shift in spending by companies away from PC-centric models to Internet models. That is what is hurting Intel, Microsoft and Dell. And the companies in the advertising-based Internet area are in difficult straits.</p>
        <p>The changes that are going on are long-term trends.</p>
        <p>Q. -- About 30 percent of the portfolios you manage is invested in technology stocks. How did you reposition yourself?</p>
        <p>A. -- The stocks we have pared back to, we feel, have solid fundamentals.</p>
        <p>Our main technology positions are EMC in storage networking, Sun Microsystems in Internet infrastructure and Cisco Systems and Corning in the optical area. We also own Adobe Systems in software.</p>
        <p>I think it is a fairly good, diversified list. But there are no semiconductor names.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Has the meltdown in semiconductor stock prices made them more attractive? You used to own Intel, for example. Are you at all tempted to buy it again?</p>
        <p>A. -- I am not going to buy a technology stock just because the price is lower, because all of a technology company's assets are intellectually based.</p>
        <p>Companies like Microsoft and Intel are making the transition to the Internet, but they have big legacy products as they make the change. And the current product lines, and the ones you can see out over the next six months to a year, don't give me any confidence in investing at current price levels.</p>
        <p>Q. -- The changes you are talking about are essentially evolutionary. Is anything more transitory in nature smacking these stocks, too?</p>
        <p>A. -- Well, if we had been talking last February and you told me Lucent would be down 60 percent to 70 percent this year, that Intel would be down 30 percent to 40 percent, Texas Instruments cut in half from its high and Microsoft down by about 40 percent, I would have to think we would have had a pretty severe recession. We haven't, and that says a lot about the resilience of our economy.</p>
        <p>Still, we exited last year with 8.6 percent fourth-quarter growth. And the rate has decelerated every quarter since. That slowdown, in turn, has led to concerns about a slowdown in spending on telecommunications products.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the euro has weakened against the dollar, and there is concern about oil prices, which began to rise about a year ago. And there are concerns about inflation and interest rates, which affect valuations on higher-growth stocks.</p>
        <p>I don't anticipate these things will lead to a recession. But these macro aspects will remain unfriendly until the end of the first quarter next year.</p>
        <p>Q. -- That said, the sell-off has created buying opportunities in some stocks, hasn't it?</p>
        <p>A. -- I am more looking to add to positions than initiate new ones at this juncture. EMC is much more interesting now. So is Adobe Systems. And you are finding some areas in the older economy that are more attractive.</p>
        <p>We own Home Depot, for example. I would be buying that stock here. The company is very well managed, and they feel they are pregnant with opportunities.</p>
