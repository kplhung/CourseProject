        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am an artist and a writer, but according to Caryn James [''To Get the Best View of Television, Try Using a Wide Lens,'' Oct. 1] I'm hopelessly out of it for not watching TV, because ''anyone who does not watch television cannot possibly understand mainstream American culture.'' Maybe so -- if it's drug culture she means. Television is probably the most addictive and widely consumed narcotic in America. Ms. James's assertion that you have to immerse yourself in television in order to truly understand the cultural moment strikes me as symptomatic of a mind deadened from overexposure.</p>
        <p>In fact, television represents everything that deep-rooted culture is not. The art of any community, large or small, is distilled from numberless creative moments in the lives of its people. Creation is active, not passive. Television operates to dull the senses. Mostly we watch it to kill time -- a miraculously easy way of deferring the tougher demands of consciousness, without which we can't even begin to speak of culture.</p>

        <p>Although tube-watching is occasionally enlivened by good content, the medium, as Marshall McLuhan would say, is still the message. Television is not about culture or music or art or anything else. Television is only about television. Its one-way message neither reflects nor feeds our true lives, but it does provide industry marketers with a constant delivery system aimed at the purses and wallets of American consumers. If you like television, then by all means watch it. If you want culture, look elsewhere.</p>
