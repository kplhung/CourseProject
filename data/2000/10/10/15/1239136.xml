        <p>Two levels of grief were at work today in this quintessential Navy town. In one, elected officials and Navy families gathered at a waterfront park for the long-planned dedication of a new statue, ''The Homecoming,'' which by a somber coincidence with the tragedy of the destroyer Cole, depicts a joyous sailor safely reuniting with his family after a tour of foreign  duty.</p>
        <p>Across town, Diane McDaniels was suffering a far more visceral grief, grappling with the Navy's latest alert about a different sort of homecoming -- the return of the body of her son, James, who perished in the explosion that struck the Cole on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''They said he could be home today or tomorrow,'' the mother said, pacing her apartment on Chesapeake Avenue, alternately fighting tears, then cherishing sudden memories that came upon her of ''Little Mac,'' her son.</p>
        <p>''Oh, all the girls loved him,'' said the mother, suddenly beaming at a vital image of him going about the Norview neighborhood with his friends. ''They liked his sweetness. And, oh my, those dimples he had.''</p>
        <p>Seaman McDaniels shipped out Aug. 8, confiding to his family that, five months into a four-year hitch, he could already tell that the Navy was not the career for him. ''When I heard the TV news about the terrorist bombing, I just knew he was dead, Mrs. McDaniels said. ''I said it. I said, 'He's gone. My boy is gone.' ''</p>
        <p>The mother spoke surrounded by a family clutch of two daughters and five grandchildren who have been left with one unexpected but comforting postscript to the short life of James McDaniels, 19: Before he left, he conceived a child with his high school sweetheart, Novella Wiggins.</p>
        <p>The first videotaped ultra-sound pictures of his future son, to be born in March, were on the way to the Cole when the explosion ended the sailor's life. ''He never saw his son,'' Mrs. McDaniels said, adding that he had sent animated e-mail messages about the coming birth and his plans to be a dedicated family man.</p>
        <p>''We got too many men named James in this family,'' said the mother. ''And we like to make up names in my race, you know, so he suggested Daisaan, or maybe Daisaan Jesse James,'' she said, smiling once more. ''Or he said he'd just call him 'Ace.' ''</p>
        <p>The two young people were planning to get married at Seaman McDaniels's next homecoming, Mrs. McDaniels said. ''But then the two Navy officers came here to tell me he was gone, and I collapsed.'' she said. ''Novella ran screaming down the street.''</p>
        <p>At the statue dedication, Mayor Paul Fraim welcomed a crowd of several hundred people. White-haired veterans and young Navy families were bathed in sunshine at the Hampton Roads harbor front.</p>
        <p>''Not all homecomings are happy,'' the mayor said of the casualties aboard the Cole. ''We still live in a dangerous world.''</p>
        <p>A sailor's homecoming has long been a cherished ritual in the Navy, Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia said at the statue dedication. He recalled his own first Norfolk homecoming 42 years ago as a marine safely back from combat. ''A moment of joy and celebration and happiness,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he slowly added, ''The homecoming is not guaranteed.'' He said that for all its obvious joy, the statue presented a worthy undertone, too, in honoring ''the memory of all those who didn't get their last homecoming.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. McDaniels said she would need help with the homecoming of her son. ''I can't imagine burying him, putting him in the ground,'' she said. ''It will be devastating all over again. My heart is just hurting.''</p>
        <p>In the crowd by the Homecoming statue, 81-year-old Buck Weaver said he had to come by in sympathy for Seaman McDaniels and the Cole crew because he was a Navy veteran who survived the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. He was scrambling for his life inside the battleship Maryland when the bombs burst 59 years ago just as, he said, he knew the crew aboard the Cole must have scrambled for their lives.</p>
        <p>''Those sailors below deck, they never knew what happened, which is for the best, really,'' Mr. Weaver emphasized, speaking from his memory of war.</p>
        <p>The old sailor snapped a salute at the unveiling of the statue's happy family tableau by the edge of the sea. Then a young Navy family was chosen to come forward. Hospital Corpsman James R. Enderle of Chicago and his wife, Cindy, embraced on cue, in tune with the statue, while their two sons, Jeffery, 6, and Lorenzo, 4, hugged their legs.</p>
        <p>''Yeah!'' Mr. Weaver had to shout at this, struck by a particular memory. ''At Pearl Harbor, I was just getting ready to go ashore on liberty. I was 20 years old, a handsome devil, looking for a woman,'' he said with grand self-jest and a smile at a sailor's life.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McDaniels said her son's homecoming would end with prayers for his peaceful repose in a church cemetery. ''I want to be able to visit his grave,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Of the pending birth of Daisaan or Ace or perhaps another James McDaniels, the mother said she would be looking for dimples, adding, ''There's going to be some sadness when we first look at him.''</p>
