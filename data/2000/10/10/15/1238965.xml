        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Autographed philanthropy'' has been common in this country at least since the days of Andrew Carnegie and the Rockefellers. So what is surprising about Alberto W. Vilar [''So You Can Buy Love After All'' by Allan Kozinn, Oct. 8] is not his prominence but his vilification. It was clear from the article that his generosity is open-minded and does not lead to artistic interference. If he sometimes encourages traveling productions, what's wrong with giving opera lovers the most bang for his innumerable bucks? And if he helps bring costs down, all the better: perhaps we and many others will one day be able to afford a season at the Met.</p>
