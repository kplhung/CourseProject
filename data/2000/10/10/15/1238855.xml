        <p>THIS Thursday night, Route 66 will intersect Interstate 95 in New Haven.</p>
        <p>Route 66 is an eight-minute orchestral piece composed in 1998 by Michael Daugherty, who trained at Yale. The piece will lead off the first concert of the season for  the New Haven Symphony Orchestra  in Woolsey Hall, the heart of musical activity at Yale. The evening's program is being presented as a salute to the university's tercentenary.</p>
        <p>Besides the Daugherty work, the concert will be Saint-Saens Piano Concerto No. 2 in G Minor, Op. 22 performed by Robert Blocker, dean of the Yale School of Music, followed by Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A Major, Op. 92.</p>
        <p>With the university marking 300 years, and the New Haven Symphony founded by a Yale musician over 100  years ago, and the best music faculty and students sitting among the music stands to this day, the conductor, Jung-Ho Pak, wanted the concert to honor both the collaboration between the school and orchestra, as well as the history of musical composition at Yale.</p>
        <p>''I think Michael Daugherty's music fits my personality,'' said the 38-year old conductor by telephone from California. ''He incorporates pop music of all sorts. What you get in the end is a very serious piece. It reflects the burst of energy and rhythm that existed in America in the 60's, 70's and 80's.''</p>
        <p>The title of Mr. Daugherty's piece immediately conjures up Henry Mancini's jazzy piano riff, sophisticated but with a whiff of sleaze, the theme of a very cool television show that many baby boomers experienced in the days of only black and white.</p>
        <p>In the program notes, the composer, who was born in 1954, said the piece was a musical reflection on America ''as seen though my rear view mirror.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pak said: ''It's a serious piece with a hip twist on it. It's a very physical piece. The audience will sense that the orchestra has to work. It's an eight minute jolt of caffeine.''</p>
        <p>Farther down the road of music history are the icons of the European musical tradition, which, in the present, definitely are -- in automotive mirror parlance -- closer than they appear. Robert Blocker, dean of the Yale School of Music since 1995, will perform the Piano Concerto by the French composer Camille Saint-Saens, who straddled the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pak expressed his admiration for the dean's keyboard skills, saying: ''I heard him in a concert last year and I was taken with his sensitivity and musical vulnerability. For me, he represents the music department very well.''</p>
        <p>The second half of the concert will take the audience on a wildly rhythmic ride, with Beethoven's Seventh. ''The third movement contains a joyous bunch of frolicking quarter notes; it's presto so it's very quick -- like a minuet on fast-forward,'' said Mr. Pak, adding that he thought of the fourth movement as ''essentially a hoedown,'' saying, ''Your foot's always tapping.''</p>
        <p>The New Haven Symphony Orchestra performs works by Daugherty, Saint-Saens and Beethoven on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in Woolsey Hall at Yale. For tickets and information call (800) 292-6476(NHSO) or go to www.newhavensymphony.com.</p>
