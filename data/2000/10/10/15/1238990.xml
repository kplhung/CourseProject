        <p>THE owner and operator of High Mountain Bobcat Trucking in Bellevue, Idaho, Edward Mulick, describes himself as ''a real Idaho boy.'' He works outside, plowing snow in the winter, dirt in the summer. He idolizes potato farmers the way some people worship movie stars. No matter what, he's loyal to his friends, who have nicknames like Fathead and Squirrel and beards so bushy they store pencils in them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulick, 33, never puts on airs (a taboo among his Idaho friends), especially not with his clothes or his choice of beer. ''You have to drink Bud or Coors, none of that fancy microbrewery stuff,'' said Megan Burks, a friend who grew up in Hailey, Idaho, a few miles down the road.</p>

        <p>THE owner and operator of High Mountain Bobcat Trucking in Bellevue, Idaho, Edward Mulick, describes himself as ''a real Idaho boy.'' He works outside, plowing snow in the winter, dirt in the summer. He idolizes potato farmers the way some people worship movie stars. No matter what, he's loyal to his friends, who have nicknames like Fathead and Squirrel and beards so bushy they store pencils in them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulick, 33, never puts on airs (a taboo among his Idaho friends), especially not with his clothes or his choice of beer. ''You have to drink Bud or Coors, none of that fancy microbrewery stuff,'' said Megan Burks, a friend who grew up in Hailey, Idaho, a few miles down the road.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulick was not the sort of man Anne Moles, 27, dreamed of. ''Did I ever imagine I'd fall in love with a truck driver from Idaho and live in the middle of nowhere?'' she asked. ''No.''</p>
        <p>Then, in August 1998, she was invited to the Hailey wedding of Ms. Burks, a college friend. At the time, she was living in Hoboken, N.J., and considered herself to be a true city girl: she drank cosmopolitans, smoked cigars, worked in the municipal bond insurance business, owned a lot of shoes (none of which had any traction in snow) and was single.</p>
        <p>So, she enlisted her best friend, Laura Stevens, to be her date at the wedding, and they made reservations at the Come On Inn, Sleep Like a Log Hotel in Bellevue. At the reception, which took place in the bride's backyard -- next to a creek, Bud on tap -- Ms. Moles asked Mr. Mulick to dance.</p>
        <p>''I had a bunch of cigars, and she said, 'I'll take one of those,' '' Mr. Mulick remembered. ''I thought, 'You smoke cigars?' She's way fun.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Moles remembers, ''We didn't stop dancing for about four hours. The next day, Ed came over and brought us coffee at our little hotel. When I said goodbye to him, I thought, 'I'm coming back.' ''</p>
        <p>She returned that winter. ''It snowed the whole time, and I called myself 'plow girl'; I just sat in Ed's truck while he plowed driveways,'' she said, adding, ''I just jumped into his way of life.''</p>
        <p>While he plowed, he told her long, long stories -- about his uncle's cattle ranch in Idaho, about driving Sno-Cats down the ski trails at Sun Valley. He'd talk until he became hoarse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulick eventually introduced Ms. Moles to his friends the Huck brothers. ''I thought with the Huck brothers, Anne might get a 'ding,' '' he said. ''In a fraternity house, if you don't like a new pledge, you give them a ding. But the Huck brothers loved Anne and they don't sugarcoat anything.''</p>
        <p>In June 1999, Ms. Moles left behind her futon and her business suits and moved to Bellevue, where she and Mr. Mulick now live in a new Victorian-style house surrounded by a mishmash of architecture, trailers, modular homes and historic houses under renovation. ''I left behind my attitude, too,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She works as a freelance interior designer and has become accustomed to Idaho life with Mr. Mulick: to riding their Harley motorcycle over mountain passes and keeping her cowboy hat on while dancing; and to waving hello 100 times a day. ''You drive on the road and you know 9 out of 10 drivers,'' she said. ''It's like, 'Oh, here comes Jobe in his green truck.' We know the U.P.S. girl so well she writes, 'Hi, Ed and Anne' on our packages.''</p>
        <p>On Oct. 7, the couple were married in Hightstown, N.J., at the Ayer Memorial Chapel at the Peddie School, where Ms. Moles attended high school. For the bride's mother, Polly Moles, the wedding was like a June snowstorm in Idaho, which is not unheard of -- magical and depressing at once. ''This is so antiquated, but Anne belongs to somebody else now,'' her mother said. ''When she went to bed Friday night before the wedding, that was the last time Anne Moles slept in her bed. Anne Moles Mulick will be in that bed from now on, and I can't walk in and say, 'Annie, it's time to wake up!' I have to knock on the door now.''</p>
