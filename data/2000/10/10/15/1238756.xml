        <p>AFTER THE WAR</p>
        <p>By Alice Adams.</p>
        <p>306 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $25.</p>
        <p>TIME was, fans of Alice Adams could take heart at the end of a novel. The regret the reader felt at saying goodbye to characters who had become as vivid and familiar as next-door neighbors was tempered by the thought that another set of characters -- no less spirited and angst-ridden -- was waiting in the wings. Alas, with the death last year of this engaging novelist and short-story writer, that consolation no longer exists. But we have, as the last and certainly not least installment of a prolific career, her 11th novel, ''After the War,'' which she finished before she died. An entertaining sequel to one of her best, ''A Southern Exposure'' (1995), it gives further life to the denizens of Pinehill, the Southern college town that proved so rich and surprising a meeting ground for North and South, and so illustrative of Freud's oft-quoted insight about the narcissism of small differences.</p>
        <p>You don't have to have been there when, in the midst of the Depression, Cynthia and Harry Baird and their daughter, Abigail, fled upscale Connecticut and financial embarrassment for a supposedly more low-key and low-rent -- though intellectually stimulating -- corner of the South. That flight and its consequences, the substance of the previous novel, are gracefully recapped in the new one, but it is a lot more fun to have witnessed firsthand the sparks as Cynthia engaged with locals like the pastel-wearing Dolly Bigelow, the sweet-snide social arbiter whose dumb act doesn't fool Cynthia; Russ (James Russell Lowell Byrd), the famous poet-playwright with whom Cynthia hopes to have a passionately platonic, poetry-reciting affair; Jimmy, the neighbor who idolizes Russ and yearns to write; and his wife, Esther, a Midwestern Jew who alone is consumed with anxiety about Hitler and German Jews. Odessa, the majestic and talented black woman, was and still is a bone of contention between Cynthia and Dolly, and a force to reckon with in her own right.</p>
        <p>In ''After the War,'' Abigail grows up alongside her pal Melanctha, Russ's troubled daughter -- named by him, in a fit of literary and integrationist whimsy, after the eponymous black girl in Gertrude Stein's great novella. Their struggles with college, men, sex and parents are related along with the further stumblings and gropings of their elders. Deirdre, the town beauty who came home in ''A Southern Exposure'' with a little ''brother'' (actually her child from an affair with Russ), is now married to the widowed Russ; she has grown fat and lazy, but is still a magnet to men, particularly those in whom Cynthia is interested.</p>
        <p>With a style as blithe and contagious as the Southern accent Harry and Cynthia acquire in spite of themselves, Adams dips in and out of lives jauntily, humorously, in a kind of eternal present tense. Life goes on; characters ask themselves questions but do not stay for an answer. Such truths as may be known are revealed in fine Southern fashion -- indirectly. You may, if you wish, think more deeply about these matters, but you are not obliged to do so. With its deliberately breezy tone and style and multiple crises, the novel is an unabashed page turner, a kind of ''Peyton Place'' for college graduates or -- as other commentators have remarked of Adams generally -- like gossip with a good friend.</p>
        <p>The tragic and the mundane, the savage and the silly coexist and collide indiscriminately, and sometimes the reader can't quite decide whether to view Adams as merely a purveyor of guilty pleasures or as something more. In this case, the method of the Virginia-born author coincides with the modus vivendi of the characters she portrays, Southerners who use social conventions both to conceal and to reveal. She understands that the ingratiating persona presented to the world is not a mere facade, but an important part of the story. To be pleasant in public (a public that may even include one's family!) is an obligation both honorable and essential.</p>
        <p>In the same vein, Adams's loose-jointed style allows her, in her best novels, to touch on dark events and emotions without having them disrupt the flow of life or descend into clinical pathology: fathers who feel forbidden desire for their daughters; peacock males who are terrified of the women who love them; a woman's suicidal and (to herself) inexplicable depression; a child's fear of madness; a man's ambiguous death, which shocks yet is quickly absorbed in the implacable onrush of life. The earlier death of SallyJane, Melanctha's mother and Russ's first wife, from electroshock therapy remains a shadow over the proceedings, haunting as a mystery that is never spelled out or even directly addressed, but that is also faintly absurd.</p>
        <p>The downside of this surface-skimming affability is a certain lack of formal rigor and overall design. Adams's virtues may be more easily defined negatively, by what she avoids. In her evenhanded approach to character, there is no special pleading, no ax to grind -- do-gooders and lefties can be as myopic as outright bigots; the beautiful bitch we might wish to despise or patronize is capable of gleaming, and redeeming, intelligence. Blacks -- or, in the period idiom that she employs with perfect pitch, ''Negroes'' and ''coloreds'' -- figure importantly. Like Gertrude Stein, she wants to portray blacks as complex characters in their own right rather than projections of white fears and fantasies.</p>
        <p>Her writing is perhaps most fine-tuned in her sensitivity to place, her feeling for the flora and fauna that anchor her characters, nourish their memories and give them refuge. The Bairds become transplants in a state that, though unnamed, is vividly and unmistakably North Carolina, with its lakes and woods and piney trails, its mild climate in winter and stifling humidity in summer, its competitive gardens and political perversities. The eccentric Tarheel blend of liberal and reactionary, parochial and sophisticated, is, like New York and San Francisco -- Adams's other favorite locales -- a perfect stage for the multicultured ensembles at which she excels.</p>
        <p>Like a gardener who doesn't overwater the plants, or a benignly indifferent mother, she is attentive to each of her creations but gives each its head; she lets them all fly free of her control while appreciating their idiosyncrasies. Her mix of old-fashioned storytelling with a modern sense of the elusive perplexities of identity makes for an unusual combination, and one not easily replaced.</p>
