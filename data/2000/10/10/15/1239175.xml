        <p>At 300 pounds, he can dunk a basketball with his back to the basket and his hands behind his head. He can dunk it with a reverse double pump. He can dunk it from the baseline, the foul line, the end line.</p>
        <p>''You tell me how you want it dunked,'' Cornelius Griffin, the Giants' rookie defensive tackle, said. ''I can do it.''</p>
        <p>He does not play much tennis, but someone recently told Griffin he could beat him at the game. Griffin accepted the challenge. And won.</p>
        <p>''Good game for your footwork,'' Griffin said.</p>
        <p>He was the captain of his high school baseball team.</p>
        <p>''I loved baseball,'' Griffin said. ''I hit some a mile.''</p>
        <p>In his hometown, Brundidge, Ala., he was the captain of all of his high school teams -- football, baseball, basketball -- just as he was the captain of his junior college football team in Mississippi and at the University of Alabama.</p>
        <p>Athletically, the 6-foot-3-inch Griffin is simply gifted at most things. ''He may be the strongest player on our team,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Players on the Giants' defensive line said Griffin once told them he was the ''greatest 300-pound athlete in the world,'' something Griffin denied.</p>
        <p>''I didn't say it like that,'' Griffin said somewhat impishly. ''Or I didn't mean it like that.''</p>
        <p>Griffin was the Giants' second-round draft pick last spring, the player selected to replace defensive tackle Robert Harris, whom the team cut earlier this year. The veterans on the defensive line immediately dubbed Griffin, Little Rob.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the Giants' last playoff season, Harris had 10 sacks and his play up the middle along with tackle Keith Hamilton helped to make the Giants the seventh-best team in the National Football League against the run. But in many ways, the Giants' defense had not been the same since, with an aging Harris being slowed by injuries.</p>
        <p>Though the Giants have not approached that kind of production from their tackles, Griffin, who was given Harris's old jersey number, 97, may eventually change that.</p>
        <p>Griffin, seeing his first extended playing time last weekend because Hamilton was injured, had a big game against the Falcons at Atlanta. He had a sack, batted down two passes and made two tackles.</p>
        <p>On the sack, Griffin burst between the Falcons' center and guard nearly untouched and dragged quarterback Danny Kanell down with one arm.</p>
        <p>Griffin had been timing Kanell's signal-calling cadence at the line.</p>
        <p>''He was going, 'Hut, hut' and then he'd pause and come back with a third 'hut' and the ball would be snapped,'' Griffin said of Kanell. ''For two or three series in a row he did that. I timed it and just took off. I didn't even wait to see the ball move.''</p>
        <p>Defensive tackles have the most sordid work environment on the football field. They are surrounded by teammates with flexible responsibilities and attention-grabbing roles, but tackles are usually double-teamed with players falling at their knees.</p>
        <p>''A defensive tackle can't see anything down there in the trenches,'' Denny Marcin, the Giants' defensive line coach, said. ''But they have to feel where the gaps are. They can't see but they've got to feel. It's athleticism. He's still just a rookie, but I see that in Cornelius. He's strong, quick and he's smart enough to treat the veterans with a lot of respect.''</p>
        <p>Griffin, 23, said his parents, Martha and Willie B. Griffin Jr., taught him to learn from his elders. In Brundidge, a town of fewer than 3,000, Willie Griffin was a self-employed trucker, a mechanic and a minister at the Lily White Holiness Pentecostal Church.</p>
        <p>''Everybody in Brundidge knows you, your father, your mother and your grandparents,'' Griffin said. ''We were taught to love and respect all people and my father was like a father to all the kids in Brundidge. He treated them like they were his sons.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, at age 50, Willie Griffin was killed in a head-on collision with a drunken driver. When Cornelius pulled up to his house later that day, he wondered, ''Why are there all these cars here?''</p>
        <p>''I knew it was something bad,'' Griffin said, standing outside the Giants' locker room last week. ''I didn't know how bad.''</p>
        <p>''In my opinion -- and my friends thought so, too -- he was the perfect man.''</p>
        <p>Griffin, the eldest child still living at home, said he ''grew up overnight.''</p>
        <p>''I was 21, but I was a kid,'' Griffin said. ''But that's when I became a man. I was the man of the house and I had to act it.''</p>
        <p>He was about to head to Alabama and considered not going. But Griffin, with some trying moments, persevered as he poured his energy into football. In his senior season, he led the team with 22 sacks.</p>
        <p>''My father would have said that life goes on,'' he said. ''He'd be happy that I'm still working hard at this.''</p>
        <p>Griffin's role with the Giants will most likely expand, perhaps as a third tackle in a rotation with Hamilton and Christian Peter.</p>
        <p>''He has all the tools,'' Marcin said.</p>
        <p>Griffin would not disagree, though he might give it his own spin.</p>
        <p>''You tell me what to do,'' he said. ''I think I can do it.''</p>
