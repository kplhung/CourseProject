        <p>Four years ago, when my girlfriend and I moved in together, we considered it a step toward marriage. She was working as a waitress then. The money I made as a magazine editor would have been considered good most any place else except New York City, which is where we were living. Having grown up here, though, I had a bit of a boost, like the storefront apartment in Brooklyn I rented from my stepfather for slightly below market. My share of that rent was cut in half the day we moved her stuff from TriBeCa in three vanloads. The spending that was left to do we shared with a graceful eagerness to be the first to reach into our pockets to cover the grocery bill, the tab at a restaurant or the bar, even the dry cleaner. We didn't have much, but we spent what we had and didn't worry about it.</p>
        <p>When we got married, we started our life together with generous gifts from friends and family -- an inordinate proportion of bowls -- and $9,000 in cash. We opened our first joint account, a savings fund, for that money. We also opened a joint checking account, though the plan was to keep our finances separate. That joint checking account would be a neutral ground, fed by our separate checking accounts, and all the household expenses would be funneled through it. I was no more certain about what constituted a legitimate household expense than I was about the need to maintain separate accounts, but I did not protest. She had an explicit preference.

        <p>Four years ago, when my girlfriend and I moved in together, we considered it a step toward marriage. She was working as a waitress then. The money I made as a magazine editor would have been considered good most any place else except New York City, which is where we were living. Having grown up here, though, I had a bit of a boost, like the storefront apartment in Brooklyn I rented from my stepfather for slightly below market. My share of that rent was cut in half the day we moved her stuff from TriBeCa in three vanloads. The spending that was left to do we shared with a graceful eagerness to be the first to reach into our pockets to cover the grocery bill, the tab at a restaurant or the bar, even the dry cleaner. We didn't have much, but we spent what we had and didn't worry about it.</p>
        <p>When we got married, we started our life together with generous gifts from friends and family -- an inordinate proportion of bowls -- and $9,000 in cash. We opened our first joint account, a savings fund, for that money. We also opened a joint checking account, though the plan was to keep our finances separate. That joint checking account would be a neutral ground, fed by our separate checking accounts, and all the household expenses would be funneled through it. I was no more certain about what constituted a legitimate household expense than I was about the need to maintain separate accounts, but I did not protest. She had an explicit preference. I did not.</p>
        <p>When I thought about it, I considered it somehow related to her desire to keep her own name. Maybe not altogether logical, but intuitively plausible. What's more, that explanation made her attitude seem within the norms of marital behavior. Of the 21 couples I know well, only three share a name. I'd bet even less of them keep separate checking accounts, but who wanted to bring that up and create friction back then?</p>
        <p>Just around the time of our wedding, I left my magazine job, planning to work as a freelancer until a better idea struck me. My wife was still waiting on tables, now at a two-star restaurant downtown. During the day she worked on a novel. Her schedule essentially left me in charge of the house, a role that comes naturally to me. Day to day, we lived frugally, but almost always managed to find money for the things we wanted -- the occasional expensive dinner, a few weekends away. In the spring of our first married year, we purchased a 1992 Mazda from the estate of my mother's best friend. The car had a book value of six grand; we paid three, with the understanding that we would pay down the balance in the future. The car greatly improved our quality of life, all the more so because with it we inherited its space in a parking lot around the corner. We paid for that car from our joint savings account, the only time we ever agreed to spend any of that money.</p>
        <p>Then one day, about six months after we were married, short on cash for my half of the rent and expecting a check any day, I withdrew $1,000 from our joint savings account. I did not consult my wife. I neglected to tell her about it that evening or any evening thereafter. The check would arrive any day, I reasoned. I would deposit it and the whole humiliating episode would disappear. And that's the way it went: the check arrived and our joint savings account was made whole again.</p>
        <p>It worked so flawlessly that within a short time, I fooled myself into believing that the joint savings account could be my hedge against the unpredictability of freelance life. I started dipping into the account long before the anticipated arrival of a paycheck. Then, when three freelance gigs dematerialized in quick succession, I started to loosen my working definition of ''anticipated.'' I wasn't making any money at all, but I couldn't bring myself to face this fact, much less confess it to my wife. I brimmed with shame, hurt pride and fear that she would write me off as a failure right then and there.</p>
        <p>Within six months, I spent the entire $6,000, with no checks in the pipeline, and the day came when I had to tell my wife. She was about to leave for a writers' retreat, and I came home to make us lunch. My eyes swept the floor between us as I explained that I was broke and I'd spent our money on rent, car maintenance and other household bills. And, I added, I needed more to make my share of the rent for next month.</p>
        <p>My earliest memories of money are about blowing my allowance on comic books. That's what kids do, of course, and no one blames them for it. By the time you're old enough to take out college loans, you're supposed to know better than that. But over the last 11 years, I've missed more payments on my loans than I care to count. When I was working lousy jobs in my early 20's -- subsisting on beans and rice, going without cable television and, at the end of the pay cycle, hopping the odd turnstile on the way to work -- this delinquency was perhaps justifiable. You might have almost felt sorry for me, if you hadn't also seen me out riding a $700 racing bicycle in the park or at the bar, buying rounds for the boys when it was my turn, sometimes before. It's not something I'm proud of, but this hopscotch between poverty and prosperity is how I've lived most of my adult life.</p>
        <p>My carelessness about money aroused my wife's deepest-held fears and anxieties. She hated using credit cards, and when bills came to our home, she opened hers immediately and pored over them for errors or inaccuracies. She paid off the total balance immediately, and if for some reason she couldn't, it haunted her. Because of this, she splurged on herself very rarely. As her new, eager-to-impress husband, I saw this as a great opportunity. It meant I could buy her all the self-indulgent things she denied herself.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, my credit-card bills were piling up in the front hall, going unopened until I couldn't stand looking at them any longer or, more likely, their successors arrived a month later. Once opened, I would never even scan the itemized list -- I knew what I had done. I'd glance at the line that read ''minimum balance due'' and fill out the check.</p>
        <p>As I sank deeper into debt -- dipping into our savings though no longer spending much of anything on myself -- I kept buying her gifts, sometimes extremely expensive ones; for her 30th birthday, I paid a seamstress to replicate a vintage rayon dress, one of her favorites, in yellow silk. Eventually she begged me to stop with the gifts. Only now can I imagine the horror she perceived inside each delicate package. But she kept her horrors to herself, and so did I. Dead broke, flailing in my career, I was too ashamed to talk to her about money. I tried once, proposing a monthly bill-paying day. I would pay my bills, she would pay hers, then we'd do the joint ones. But she wanted no part of this. My money problem, she said, was something I would have to fix by myself.</p>
        <p>It turned out that my confession about spending our savings was unnecessary, at least in the sense that my wife already knew about it. All along, she'd been monitoring the bank statements and watching the account dwindle, consoling herself with the hope that the problem would just go away. Or maybe she was just waiting for me to come clean. Either way, we never recovered from the confession. During a session with the second of our two marriage counselors, my wife stated, quite matter-of-factly, that she would have preferred that I had slept with another woman than taken that money from our savings account. Infidelity, she said, she could get over. She described my actions as ''stealing'' that day and would many times after.</p>
        <p>I don't know if, at the time, I saw it any differently.</p>
        <p>To her way of thinking, I had squandered our future. Never mind that it was only $6,000; a couple of freelance checks, if I could only get them, would have covered it. And we were far from destitute -- we could afford a marriage counselor at $200 a week, after all. In fact, our finances were steadily improving. I had just landed a steady, well-paying job, and she had received a windfall from a book contract, as well as a modest inheritance. But all the new income only made matters worse; at her insistence our finances, unintegrated from the beginning, were made entirely separate. She never put another dime into our joint checking account. What was hers was entirely hers, what was mine entirely mine.</p>
        <p>I made no serious argument, mounted no significant defense. I was immobilized by the funk that lowered over me, certainly mentally, sometimes even physically. I tried to take the long view -- had to, really. This wasn't the first time that I had mishandled money, and it wouldn't, I suspected, be the last.</p>
        <p>It was always my intention to put the money back, but the widening gulf between us made that point academic. And I even resorted to using money to lift my spirits. That job I got was the first one I've ever had that paid New York money, and I went right out and spent New York money on a pair of suits that seemed appropriate to my fancy new title. I wasn't entirely sure how the first paycheck was going to cover my sartorial splendor and the rent, but in a world governed by first impressions, I reasoned, what's the point of showing up in the right suit on your 31st day on the job?</p>
        <p>My wife wouldn't have seen it that way, but by then we were barely talking. We agreed to live apart, and she started splitting her time between an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and the writing conference/retreat circuit. For this she needed the car. So she took our Mazda.</p>
        <p>Last fall, my wife told me and the marriage counselor that she didn't want to come to any more sessions. The marriage was over. This was 23 months from our wedding day. After her few remaining possessions were removed from the house, there was very little left to do. Our finances, after all, had been separate. Disentangling our lives has been astonishingly simple, which sometimes feels like a relief and sometimes like a chilling indictment, depending on my mood. Getting the United States Postal Service to respond to change-of-address cards has been the biggest hassle to date.</p>
        <p>The final act of separation was the drafting of a ''no fault'' agreement. I took care of that. She took care of closing our joint checking account. We both neglected to consult the other about these acts. How each of us found out tells as much about us as there is left to know. A check I wrote on our joint account bounced. She received a note on the bulletin board at a writers' retreat that a Federal Express package had arrived for her.</p>
        <p>Around this time, my wife purchased an apartment that I have never seen. I imagine she feels quite safe there, protected from the maelstrom of my finances. As for her contention that infidelity is preferable to fiscal irresponsibility, I'm no longer convinced. It was wrong to take the money, I've never contested that. But the impulse behind it, however misguided and immature, was much more hopeful than anything involving infidelity ever could be. I wasn't just trying to keep up appearances through a hard time. I feared that if I told her about what I was going through, she'd lose all confidence in me. And why risk that, when I really believed that the problems were temporary? I wasn't always going to be broke, and I wanted to keep our expectations high, even if my personal finances couldn't justify them at that moment.</p>
        <p>When we were boyfriend and girlfriend, my habits weren't threatening to her. But when we were married, my wife looked at my behavior as a liability. As humiliating as it was, I considered it a negotiable problem, something married couples could get over, if they wanted to. She saw it as a death sentence.</p>
        <p>The $6,000 I took from our joint account was never replaced. Which is to say, I never replaced it. It hasn't been discussed in a long time. The last I heard from my ex-wife was a phone message on my birthday. A pleasant enough greeting and a brief update, cheerful in its way: on her way back from another writers' conference, the odometer on the Mazda ticked past 100,000 miles. She thought I'd like to know. The car is still worth at least three grand, equal to one-half of the blown savings account, and it's all hers.</p>
