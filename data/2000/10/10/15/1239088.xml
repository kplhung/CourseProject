        <p>Metromedia, a White Plains-based company that provides fiber-optic infrastructure to businesses, announced plans to acquire the California-based SiteSmith Inc., in an all-stock deal that could be valued as high as $1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The exact price will depend on Metromedia's stock value at the end of the year, when the deal is expected to occur. SiteSmith provides comprehensive Internet infrastructure management. The acquisition will allow Metromedia to provide those services in-house rather than contracting them out. Metromedia has about 1,100 employees worldwide, with about 350 in White Plains, a company spokeswoman, Kara Carbone, said.</p>
