        <p>Once Just Walls, Now a Gallery</p>
        <p>Here a space, there an artist. No sooner do you say ''blank wall'' than Sarah Bracey White, director of arts and culture for  Greenburgh, turns it into a gallery. The newest will be dedicated today at 3 p.m. at Town Court featuring Susan Stillman and her house portraits (right).</p>
        <p>Ms. White credits Doris T. Friedman, the town justice of Greenburgh, with the idea for the gallery. ''She thought that if we put art on the walls it would make things more pleasant for all the people who come into the legal system,'' Ms. White said.</p>

        <p>Once Just Walls, Now a Gallery</p>
        <p>Here a space, there an artist. No sooner do you say ''blank wall'' than Sarah Bracey White, director of arts and culture for  Greenburgh, turns it into a gallery. The newest will be dedicated today at 3 p.m. at Town Court featuring Susan Stillman and her house portraits (right).</p>
        <p>Ms. White credits Doris T. Friedman, the town justice of Greenburgh, with the idea for the gallery. ''She thought that if we put art on the walls it would make things more pleasant for all the people who come into the legal system,'' Ms. White said.</p>
        <p>The courthouse is behind the police station near Town Hall, which houses the Madeleine Gutman Gallery, named for the previous arts and culture director. A children's art gallery is up and running at the Theodore D. Young Community Center, and Ms. White wants to display art in a vacant storefront on East Hartsdale Avenue.</p>
        <p>The exhibitions change monthly and are not juried. ''I consider all of these community galleries,'' Ms. White said. ''Artists are always so self-critical that by the time they want to mount a show they've been working and weeding for a long time. It's my opportunity to help them learn how to put a show together and help them get started.''</p>
        <p>Authors' Millennium Moment</p>
        <p>Remember the millennium? The Westchester Millennium Commission does, and wants others to remember, too.</p>
        <p>The group is helping with the Westchester Library System's annual dinner Nov. 16 at Tappan Hill in Tarrytown. The theme is millennium authors, and the commission will pay for 30 authors to attend.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Cheever and Cynthia Ozick have the honor of presiding, and Joyce Carol Oates will speak. The dinner-meeting is open to the public at $47 a person. Information: (914) 674-3600, extension 226 or 227.</p>
        <p>The commission will also join the Westchester County Youth Board and Bureau in honoring student volunteers at a dinner Nov. 30 at the Rye Town Hilton. ($35 a person)</p>
        <p>Finally, before the commission disbands, the group will join in sponsoring the Westchester Arts Council's annual fund-raising party, ''Thinking Outside the Box,'' on Dec. 9 in the Citigroup Hangar of the Westchester County Airport. Information: (914) 428-4220.</p>
        <p>The commission hopes to leave its mark with its Westchester Arts Legacy Awards, the first of which will be presented at the arts gala either to a group or to an individual artist.</p>
        <p>Jazz as Inspiration and Muse</p>
        <p>When Joel A. Martin found his calling, he prepared himself for the skeptics. There were bound to be some, considering that Mr. Martin's mission is to spread what he calls ''jazzical music'' to the masses.</p>
        <p>The term, which Mr. Martin, a pianist, has copyrighted, refers to the marriage of classical music and jazz. He has played both styles seriously in his 34 years, even competing at 17 in the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition and as soloist with the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Despite his classical credentials, his career didn't take off until he began  combining a talent for arranging with an ability to find the jazzy elements in, say, a Chopin nocturne or a Scriabin etude. ''I play this music very seriously,'' he said. ''I turn the piece truly into a jazz composition without negating the classical tune itself.''</p>
        <p>The occasional objection has been heard, but one review suited Mr. Martin just fine. After the release of his latest CD, ''Jazzical: Brazil,'' a critic wrote that while purists might hate the idea of Mr. Martin's music, the reality was beautiful. The pianist thinks he is onto something. ''If the composers of the past were alive today, what would they be using as inspirational materials?'' he said. ''I think they'd be using jazz.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin will play music from ''Jazzical: Brazil'' at the Westchester Broadway Theater in Elmsford tomorrow at 8 p.m. in a fund-raising event for Bran Pace, a paralyzed actor. The performance will be filmed for broadcast on A&amp;E and Black Entertainment Television. Tickets are $25. Information: (914) 592-2268.</p>
