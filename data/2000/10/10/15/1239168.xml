        <p>For the last three days, gangs of grim-faced young men dressed in white uniforms with green scarves have stalked through Sukarno-Hatta International Airport, wooden rods in hand and one goal in mind: to kill any Israeli who sets foot in this, the world's largest Muslim country.</p>
        <p>The young Indonesians, foot soldiers of a radical Muslim group called the Islamic Defenders Front, said they blamed Israel for the recent violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which left dozens of Palestinian Muslims dead.</p>
        <p>''If we find any Israelis, we will first try to persuade them to leave, but if they refuse, we will slaughter them,'' said Zainuddin, a spokesman for the group, which is widely feared in Indonesia for its brutal attacks on nightclubs and bars that it considers dens of iniquity.</p>
        <p>Death threats and recent anti-Semitic statements from Indonesian politicians prompted the Israeli Parliament to withdraw from an international parliamentary conference to be held in Jakarta starting on Sunday. But the Muslim extremists said they were continuing to sweep the airport and major hotels to prevent any Israelis from sneaking into the country.</p>
        <p>''Israelis are not welcome in Indonesia because their illegal colonization has killed thousands of Muslim people,'' Mr. Zainuddin said.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, radical religious groups like the Islamic Defenders Front, which claims to have seven million members along with a well-equipped armed faction, were virtually unknown in this country of 220 million people, who are predominately Muslim.</p>
        <p>But the fall of President Suharto's repressive military government in 1998 gave way not only to social and political freedoms but also to the rise of radical Islamic movements, which have expanded rapidly. And many believe that those groups now threaten to undermine this country's efforts to forge a new democracy.</p>
        <p>While the Islamic extremists speak for only a minority of the population, their voices resonate far and wide. Thousands of Muslims nationwide staged some of the largest anti-Israeli protests ever in Indonesia this week.</p>
        <p>In Jakarta, some 10,000 Muslims rallied outside Parliament, carrying flags reading ''Jews are killers'' and chanting ''God is great.'' The protesters, who accused the United States of backing Israel in the violence, burned an Israeli flag and slaughtered a goat wrapped in emblems of the United States and Israel.</p>
        <p>Similar rallies were held in major cities across Indonesia. Some political leaders were quick to capitalize on the anti-Israeli furor.</p>
        <p>Addressing the rally at Parliament, the National Assembly chairman, Amien Rais, called on President Abdurrahman Wahid to abandon plans to establish diplomatic ties with Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid, a cleric and former head of Nahdlatul Ulama, a 30-million-member Muslim organization,  has long stressed the need for religious tolerance and freedom of thought. Indonesia has maintained close ties with Palestinian independence groups since the early 1960's, and it has never formally recognized the Jewish state.</p>
        <p>About 86 percent of Indonesia's residents are Muslim; the rest are Christian, Buddhist and Hindu. During President Suharto's rule, the military squashed any religious or ethnic violence. But new freedoms have rekindled old religious rivalries, including a vicious conflict between a large Protestant population and local Muslims in the Moluccas.</p>
        <p>''They are using Islam as a tool to express their opposition with the government's plans to open ties with Israel,'' said Al Chaidar, a researcher specializing in fundamentalist groups at the University of Indonesia, referring to the politicians.</p>
        <p>Ayelet Frisch, a spokeswoman for Israel's parliamentary speaker, said  the trip was canceled because of anti-Israeli demonstrations in Jakarta and a refusal by the Indonesian authorities to allow agents from Israel's overseas intelligence agency, Mossad, to safeguard the delegation. The conference is expected to draw about 2,000 delegates from 114 legislatures from around the world.</p>
        <p>''The reason these radical religious groups are proliferating in Indonesia is because the government has taken a hands-off approach,'' said Azyumardi Azra, rector of the State Institute for Islamic Studies in Jakarta. ''The average Indonesian does not agree with these hard-line tactics or this radical mindset, but no one is willing to step forward and oppose them.''</p>
        <p>Members of the Islamic Defenders Front, which has been linked to the military and Islamic political parties, say they are obligated by the Koran to defend Islamic principles and beliefs at all costs. They said their agenda was not only political but also social, and in recent years they have become infamous for their attacks on bars and nightclubs, in which they often rough up patrons.</p>
        <p>''These nightclubs and bars are places where people go to sin and have adultery, and we have to stop that,'' said Mr. Zainuddin, the spokesman.</p>
