        <p>LOWELL H. JUDSON had never laid eyes on Regina Seltzer, the candidate who beat Representative Michael P. Forbes by just 35 votes in last month's Democratic primary election, but he did not hesitate when asked to host a fund-raiser for her.</p>
        <p>''I've never been politically active,'' said Mr. Judson, a 77-year-old retired dress designer and year-round Water Mill resident. ''But when I heard about this 71-year-old woman who plays tennis every morning, became a lawyer at age 50 and who has the same ideals as I have, I just got so excited about her.''</p>
        <p>About 50 people, many of them retirees, waited patiently on his patio one recent Saturday to meet and open their checkbooks to Ms. Seltzer, a former Brookhaven councilwoman and retired school librarian who practices pro bono environmental law out of her Bellport home.</p>
        <p>They nodded with understanding as she apologized for being two hours late and humbly bemoaned her new life as a politician who gets ''booked for one thing before I can possibly leave the first thing I'm at.'' They applauded heartily when she spoke on the issues important to her: a woman's right to choose abortion, ''common sense'' gun control, the environment and health care reform. And they cheered her with extra vigor when she expounded on the need to improve Medicare.</p>
        <p>The event raised less than $3,000, but secured many promises to help campaign for Ms. Seltzer, from working phone banks and distributing campaign literature to writing letters to friends extolling the candidate's virtues. Ms. Seltzer and her supporters hope the kind of energy generated at events like Mr. Judson's will help her win a decidedly uphill battle against Felix J. Grucci Jr., the Brookhaven Town supervisor who is the Republican candidate for the First Congressional District seat being vacated by Mr. Forbes..</p>
        <p>Mr. Grucci has wide name recognition in the First District, which comprises Brookhaven, parts of Smithtown and all of the five East End towns. He has raised $1.2 million for the election and expects to have raised $2 million before Nov. 7, Election Day. Mr. Grucci also has the firm support of the national Republican Party, which hopes to recapture the seat that became Democratic when Mr. Forbes switched parties last year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seltzer, a recently widowed grandmother, on the other hand, is a relative unknown in the district despite having served on the Brookhaven town board in the late 1970's. While local, state and national Democratic officials have pledged to help her after endorsing Mr. Forbes in the primary, it is still unclear whether she will be given the hefty financial support that national Democratic leaders previously pledged to Mr. Forbes. She also has not been able to win the support of local and state labor leaders, who endorsed Mr. Forbes and provided volunteers for his campaign.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Seltzer's stunning victory over Mr. Forbes has captured the attention of many. She won the primary with about $40,000 in campaign contributions, a mere fraction of the $1.3 million Mr. Forbes had. She has raised more than $100,000 in the four weeks since the primary, an amount her advisers hope will convince national party leaders that she is indeed a viable candidate.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seltzer lately has been routinely putting in 14 and 15 hour days going to campaign events, greeting voters at supermarkets and train stations and above all, on the phone soliciting campaign contributions. The fundraising, she said, has her convinced of the need for campaign finance reform. ''Instead of talking about issues, I have to waste so much time raising money,'' she said. ''It's just awful.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which spent more than $1 million on television ads attacking Mr. Grucci's environmental record before the primary election, has yet to decide how much money it will spend on Ms. Seltzer's campaign. But both Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, and Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, have agreed to host fund-raisers for Ms. Seltzer in Suffolk County this month.</p>
        <p>Terrence G. Pearsall, Ms. Seltzer's campaign manager, said the events were signs that Ms. Seltzer would ultimately get the support she needs to counter Mr. Grucci's seven-digit budget. ''They're not going to waste either one of the congressman's time on a race that doesn't look like it can be won,'' he said. Mr. Pearsall, who also ran the unsuccessful campaign of Nora Bredes against Mr. Forbes in 1996, estimated that Ms. Seltzer would need to spend at least $400,000 to beat Mr. Grucci. With the help of the state and national parties, he said, ''I think we'll have enough money to put our plans into effect.''</p>
        <p>Representative Gary Ackerman, the Fifth District Democrat who lobbied hard for Mr. Forbes when local Democrats initially balked at endorsing him, has now become one of Ms. Seltzer's biggest fans and is urging national leaders to commit big dollars to her campaign. Mr. Ackerman first met Ms. Seltzer on primary election night when he invited himself to her home and campaign headquarters so he could share his assessment with Mr. Gephardt the next day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ackerman said he came away from that meeting convinced that Ms. Seltzer could win the seat. ''She was delightfully engaging and she has a great story to tell,'' he said. ''In Reggie Seltzer, you have a spry septuagenarian who rides her bicycle around the district and who not only tilted at windmills, but was able to knock the party machinery on its keester.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Seltzer said her primary victory was proof that many Democrats believed that although Mr. Forbes had switched parties, his positions on abortion and gun control -- he is opposed to both -- were antithetical to most Democrats. ''Had his views changed along with his registration, I would've been 100 percent behind him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She initially set out to persuade other Democrats, elected officials and former office holders, to run against Mr. Forbes. ''But no one would do it, because they were reluctant to buck the party,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seltzer, who fled growing anti-Semitism in Poland and immigrated to the United States with her parents when she was 8 years old, said her parents taught her that ''if you see something's not right you should do something to correct it.'' And that, she said, is why she decided to run against Mr. Forbes in late May.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seltzer's family settled in the Bronx, where her parents opened a small upholstery shop and worked long hours while Ms. Seltzer moved quickly through the public school system, eventually earning a degree in business administration from the City College of New York.</p>
        <p>She worked for a short time as a buyer of women's sportswear. ''But I hated it because I hate shopping,'' she said. She left that job and became a teacher when her husband, Stanley Seltzer, was drafted for the Korean War in 1952 and was sent to an army chemical center in Maryland. Mr. Seltzer worked on developing antidotes to chemical warfare while Ms. Seltzer taught fifth grade at a nearby school.</p>
        <p>In 1959, her husband got a job at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and moved the family, which by then included two young sons, to Suffolk County. (Her older son, Ronald, died in a car accident when he was 15 and her younger son, Eric, is now a lawyer in Manhattan.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Seltzer got a degree in library science a few years later at C. W. Post College and worked as a school librarian in Suffolk County for 13 years before the call of politics drew her into a race for the Brookhaven Town Board in 1975. She and three other Democrats were elected, giving them a majority for the first time in 50 years</p>
        <p>. ''The town had been Republican for so long and there were all these scandals,'' she said. ''So I campaigned on honesty and ethics in government, which was in short supply then, just as it's in short, short supply now.''</p>
        <p>With the help of her fellow Democrats, Ms. Seltzer championed issues near and dear to her. She helped create an ordinance protecting street trees and a town department of environmental protection, which regulates groundwater pollution and clamming in the Great South Bay.</p>
        <p>''She was always a scrapper,'' said Robert L. Hughes, a Republican councilman who served with Ms. Seltzer. ''We got along fine, as much as it is possible to get along with someone of a different party. But she doesn't give up. She's very tenacious.''</p>
        <p>But in 1980, neither Ms. Seltzer nor any of her Democratic colleagues were re-elected. It was then that Ms. Seltzer decided to become a lawyer because she had been frustrated on the council when town attorneys would tell her she had good ideas but obviously did not understand the law. She got her degree from Hofstra University and started practicing pro bono environmental law almost immediately.</p>
        <p>''I have never made money as a lawyer,'' she said. ''But that's not why I went to law school.''</p>
        <p>She has used her degree to argue for causes she believes in. She has represented the Long Island Pine Barrens Society for the last two years and has represented numerous homeowners and private citizens fighting businesses they believe are polluting their neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>And when she objected to judicial candidates accepting the endorsement of the Right to Life Party, she decided to sue the party claiming the endorsements were unconstitutional because they required the candidates to prejudge any case that might involve abortion. She lost the case and said she would have pursued an appeal to the Supreme Court had the congressional race not consumed her time.</p>
        <p>John V. N. Klein, a former Suffolk County executive who is now a lawyer and has opposed Ms. Seltzer in court, described her as ''a very capable adversary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes knows that all too well. He has endorsed Ms. Seltzer in her run against Mr. Grucci, but has not agreed to turn over whatever remains of his campaign war chest to help get the vote out for her.</p>
        <p>''I've stood by her in spite of the fact she spent a lot of time beating me up,'' Mr. Forbes said. ''Winning an upset primary has gotten attention, but now she has to put together the resources to get out a coherent message to voters, Republicans as well as Democrats. If she can do that, she certainly could win.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes and other political observers credit Ms. Seltzer's primary victory to anti-Forbes mailings and telephone calls to Democratic voters paid for by the Republican Party. Ms. Seltzer said that might have been a factor, but she believes that a mailing her campaign sent out right before the primary vote to about 15,000 registered Democrats helped her win over many voters who were simply aching for an alternative to Mr. Forbes. ''The people who got my mail voted for me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She believes that husbanding her resources and focusing on residents who are likely to vote for her will help her win in November. Mr. Pearsall, her campaign manager, estimated there are roughly 50,000 Democrats in the district, 95,000 Republicans and 50,000 independents.</p>
        <p>Political analysts said that while Ms. Seltzer's image as a grandmother who was bold enough to challenge her party and win has great appeal, she will need much more to defeat Mr. Grucci. When Mr. Forbes was the presumed Democratic candidate, The Cook Political Report, a Washington newsletter that tracks campaigns, pegged the race as a toss-up, but now calls it a likely victory for the Republicans.</p>
        <p>Amy Walter, an editor at the newsletter, said that national Democratic leaders had ''already put a lot of money into the district and they have tons of research showing where Grucci is vulnerable.'' But she added that they would more likely spend their money in the Second Congressional District, where Steve J. Israel, a Huntington Town councilman, is seen to have a better chance of beating his Republican opponent, Joan B. Johnson, the Islip Town clerk.</p>
        <p>But Richard H. Schaffer, the Suffolk County Democratic chairman, said the local party, which has turned over its headquarters to the Seltzer campaign, will do everything it can to get her elected and hopes the national party will do likewise. ''The Israel race may look more winnable right now, but when people see how weak Grucci is and how many negatives he has, they'll see this is winnable too,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bradford A. O'Hearn, a political consultant for Democrats in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, agreed. ''Reggie fits the mold that was first cast by Otis Pike,'' he said, referring to the Democrat who represented the First Congressional District in the 1960's and 1970's. ''She's a fearless, independent Democrat who has a lot of heart and a set of core values.''</p>
        <p>Some of Ms. Seltzer's friends and neighbors bristle at the constant depiction of her as the little old grandmother running for Congress. But the 5-foot-tall Ms. Seltzer said she does not mind one bit.</p>
        <p>''I am a grandmother and I'm proud of it,'' she said. ''It just shows how you can keep doing things. And it's sort of like 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' Reggie Seltzer goes to Washington -- I think it's got a little ring to it.''</p>
