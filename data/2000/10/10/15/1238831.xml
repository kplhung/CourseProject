        <p>LAST Sunday in these pages, two Americans, the actress Mary-Louise Parker and the director and former actor Joe Mantello, who went to theater school together, talked about the proper education of actors and audiences.</p>
        <p>In the dialogue below, Eileen Atkins and Alan Bates, two British actors of an earlier generation (they are both 66), discuss how actors develop from the moment they realize there is no other suitable profession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bates and Ms. Atkins are starring in ''The Unexpected Man'' by Yasmina Reza, the author of ''Art.'' Now in previews at the Promenade Theater, the play opens on Oct. 24 and, like ''Art,'' has been translated from the French by Christopher Hampton and directed by Matthew Warchus.</p>
        <p>Ms. Atkins won an Olivier Award for her performance in the original 1998 London production of ''The Unexpected Man,'' opposite Michael Gambon. Mr. Bates has not appeared on a New York stage since Simon Gray's ''Butley'' in 1973, for which he won a Tony Award.</p>
        <p>Unlike ''Art,''  ''The Unexpected Man,'' which is set on a train, does not allow its two characters to speak directly to each other until the final moments. With that in mind, The New York Times invited the two stars to talk, over lunch in London late last month, about their lives as actors. They were joined by Matt Wolf, the London theater critic for Variety. Following are excerpts from the taped conversation:</p>
        <p>ALAN BATES -- We've never worked together, although we've always wanted to, from the days when it was just remotely possible for us to play Romeo and Juliet. We talked about it for years, and then we began to laugh because we realized we weren't going to get the offer. Now we're actually doing it.</p>
        <p>EILEEN ATKINS -- And we don't have to worry about Mercutio.</p>
        <p>BATES -- [Laughs] No.  MATT WOLF -- But why be an actor? And what is it about Britain that breeds so many?  BATES -- It has nothing to do with being in this country. You want to be an actor because you want to be an actor. You suddenly realize that's what you want to do. In my case, when I was 11.  ATKINS -- You have to be an actor -- in my case, when I was 12 -- there's no choice.  BATES -- People say, ''What made you want to be an actor?'' and you don't know, there isn't an answer. But you can guess at a few things. I never expressed myself. I was quite shy, though I was also quite happy; I wasn't miserable. I think through acting you find you can say things through other people's words and other characters.  ATKINS -- As for actually choosing to be an actor -- we both get this now -- we get young people wanting advice. But if anybody comes to me and says, ''Should I become an actor?'' I say: ''Well, no. If you've got to ask me, no.''  WOLF -- Because?  ATKINS -- It's very, very rigorous.  BATES -- You can't just say, ''It's something to do because I can't think of anything else.'' There used to be people at RADA [the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London] like that who would say, ''I couldn't think of what to do, so I'm here.''  ATKINS</p>
        <p>Half my year at drama school was like that; they didn't last very long.  BATES -- They're out in a term. They either can't do it or perhaps they realize they don't want to, which is fair dues. But the profession, too, has changed. When we started, once you were lucky with something, or hit a nerve in audiences, more or less from then on you were in demand. People wanted us the minute we had made a mark. Now, for the most part, there isn't the same hunger. You can do something and then have six months out of work, whereas we got offers and got work and kept going and got used to the fact that we were always working. This generation can't rely on that at all -- with very few exceptions.</p>
        <p>I've always felt a huge need to do the theater, and it's never left me. People say ''Well, it's where your heart is.'' And it is there: it is in the doing of it at the same time with the audience present and being in charge of it, unless you've been thrown off course by a director, which can happen, and then you have a miserable time because you can't get back to your own instinct. With television and film, there are other things that are intriguing: acting in the actual location somewhere, acting sometimes very intimately and sometimes with the camera miles away. But there's nothing as big or as complete or as satisfying as the theater.  ATKINS -- I would hate to give the impression, and it's not true, that you don't have to be a very very good actor on screen as well. It is just that there is more freedom for you as an actor in the theater. But you have to be careful not to give in to the theater audience too much. It's very easy to do because you're seducing them, basically. I think there are actors who go out there just determined to seduce.  BATES -- I remember someone coming backstage to me one night after ''Butley'' in London and saying to me, ''You have to be careful that you're leading the audience and that the audience isn't leading you, which of course was what was happening to you tonight.'' I didn't know how to interpret this, so I just said, ''Good night and thank you very much.'' I realize that what he was saying might have even been true. You have to stay in charge; you've got to keep the lead.  WOLF -- Do American audiences differ from British ones?  ATKINS -- I much prefer Americans.  BATES -- This is rather awful about the rest of the audiences, but the first audiences you get in New York -- and it can last for the better part of six months -- are the best you ever get. They have an enthusiasm, an observation, a concentration. It has been a long time since I've been on the stage there, but I'm told this hasn't changed: you feel the audience participation. They don't feel they're at all above it. They're letting it be what it is, and they like it or they don't.  ATKINS -- It's that enthusiasm, which is that thing about America. They are naturally on the whole -- because we're only speaking in generalizations -- a more enthusiastic race and they show it. They also show it when they don't like it. I quite like the definiteness of that.  BATES -- I don't mind being sent back on the boat. You know where you are, and you can get on with the next job. You don't go dribbling on.  WOLF -- What about different kinds of acting? In films, audiences frequently pay to see a star play versions of himself or herself; it's performance as personality.  BATES -- If you believe what you see, then it's good acting.  ATKINS -- Believability is the whole thing.  BATES -- If the acting is true, if an understanding of character is within you, whether you have to go outside your own shape or vocal range to achieve what you want, it doesn't matter, as long as you understand it and believe it yourself.  ATKINS -- I don't think there are any rules, Alan, do you? It's like Beryl [Beryl Reid, Ms. Atkins's co-star in ''The Killing of Sister George'' 34 years ago] used to say, ''I've got the shoes; now I've got the part.''  BATES -- I love those stories. I don't disbelieve them at all. When I did the film ''An Englishman Abroad,'' I watched a run of it with a friend, and he said, ''Where did you get that funny little walk?'' -- a kind of drunken shuffle, really. And I didn't know I was doing it. You don't think, ''I'll do a funny walk,'' or whatever.  ATKINS -- They're the best things:  when you don't know you're doing them. I had a tiny part in the film of ''The Dresser,'' and an American said, ''The way you marched across the bridge at the railway station -- it was so funny: go on, do that walk,'' and I said, like you, Alan, ''I was just walking.'' But the point is that it is coming from how you're feeling, so I had found this terribly sort of bustly-brisk walk with a much bigger length of stride. And this man said I had busy legs.  WOLF -- Have you changed over time as performers?  BATES -- You're bound to have, but you don't always know how. Life just happens to you, and it's bound to influence you. You probably have more insight as you grow older, though that's not to say that you always see that you're any different. You just hope you're a bit more economical.</p>
        <p>I think you change because you must. You must develop -- become more philosophical, more wise, more witty, less witty, more showoffy, whatever. But you can't really talk about it because as an actor you're not supposed to be watching yourself. You're supposed to have a sense of yourself, but not actually stand outside and analyze yourself. I think you would lose an awful lot of your mystery or your spontaneity or your natural instincts if you did. In some ways, you don't change a lot and the reason is because acting is instinctive, and your instincts, hopefully, were always there. You understand more. Maybe that's what changes.  ATKINS -- If you think of yourself as an instrument that you use, the instrument is the same but maybe -- you hope -- it has all got a bit more finely tuned. But if you began thinking about it, you'd be a dead duck. The famous one is when you think, ''I really do know how to time things now.''  BATES -- [Laughs] That's hell. And that's when you go out and fall flat on your face because you meet a different audience; you don't meet the audience that you have planned to meet.  ATKINS -- [Laughs] I love that, Alan. That should be the title of your autobiography: ''I didn't meet the audience I planned to meet.''  WOLF -- Do you get braver?  BATES -- Yes. You think, ''I can do it.''  ATKINS -- The older you get, I find, the more you think, ''I can't do it at all'' and that everybody else is much cleverer. I got into a habit about 20 years ago of suggesting another actress for every part. I remember once, before I did John Schlesinger's production of ''Heartbreak House,'' with Colin Blakely and Kate Nelligan, telling John I couldn't do it. And then I heard he had asked another actress who was even more neurotic and thin and nonmaternal for Hesione Hushabye than I am, so I played it. But mostly, I do tend to think, ''Now I wonder if I can play it.'' It's got worse as I've got older, although I won't say the nerves have got worse because I've always had horrifying nerves.  BATES -- [In mock alarm] Oh, thank you very much.  ATKINS -- But it is always frightening, isn't it?  BATES -- It's always frightening, yes. And the thing is, the opposite to what you've described also happens. Sometimes you think: ''I could do that role. Why have they asked him?'' And then you think to yourself, ''Oh, perhaps I am 20 years older or too old for the part.'' You always stay about 40.  ATKINS -- [Laughs] What do you mean, 40? Twenty-three! You certainly say you're at least 20 years younger than you actually are.  BATES -- The point is, acting is mysterious in the sense that you can't really talk about it. You end up down a blind alley: a dead-end script.  ATKINS -- And you can't learn it. You can learn to be better and improve your technique, but you can't learn the basic talent.  BATES -- No, I don't think you can. Sometimes, when you see a film with nonactors, they can do it once but they don't know what they're doing and they couldn't do it twice; they couldn't do the run of a play. It's there once because they happen to be right for it. It is a craft, but it's a craft that's no good if you're not absolutely born to it in the first place. It can't stand alone as a craft. If you haven't got an actor's own instincts, you've got nothing.</p>
