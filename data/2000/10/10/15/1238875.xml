        <p>A WARM welcome matches the exuberant Portuguese-Brazilian dishes at Caravela, a delightful, if well-used, restaurant celebrating 14 years here.</p>
        <p>As in the past, the place is full of Old World hospitality, never more evident than in the basket heaped with bread and a generous plate of sliced spicy sausage and olives brought to the table. These piquant tidbits went well with a glass of one of Caravela's Portuguese red wines, or try the refreshing lime-juice-based caipirinha for an aperitif.</p>
        <p>When this kitchen is on, the results can be magnificent. The heady presence of cilantro drifted from garlic sauce worthy of the big, meaty mussels beneath, and just as winning were four grilled sea scallops on a bed of greens dressed with raspberry vinaigrette. Called Brazilian appetizer, one lightly crisped jumbo shrimp arrived on a crunchy salad of chopped tomato, sweet peppers and hearts of palm. Shrimp Lisboeta, however, were dry, failing even to pick up the hydrating liquors from their thin tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>With its rich sweet-tart lingonberry-Port sauce, thinly sliced portobello, shiitake and oyster mushrooms made a murky-looking dish, but the flavor was there -- earthy, complex, delicious. Not least, an astonishing presentation of three huge horns of tensile ivory squid topped a mound of julienne vegetables all dressed in a light, carefully balanced vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Squid preparations proved as inconsistent as shrimp dishes, however; stuffed squid Setubal, long a favorite of ours, was disappointing. The fluffy, savory filling stuffed one large tough, thick-fleshed squid. Two or three small ones might have been more tender.</p>
        <p>With the exception of pitifully dry swordfish in spicy Baiana sauce, entrees averaged out as an appealing lot. Flavors in a luxurious crab and langoustine mixture (apparently free of bread) that filled two langoustine shells were enriched and deepened by a lusty Cognac sauce. And treated to a bit of lemon and butter, an order of shrimp Caravela brought a half-dozen juicy jumbos in a notably crisp gossamer crust.</p>
        <p>The variety of fin and shellfish was so great that it was hard to identify all the delicious components in mariscada, perhaps the most abundant we have encountered: Monkfish, halibut, lobster, mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp -- the fish rose almost four inches out of the salsa verde, which we prefer to the tomato red sauce, which is also available.</p>
        <p>Because it must be soaked for days in constantly changed water, labor intensive baccala (dry salt cod) appears on few menus, but Caravela prepares it -- beautifully. In the style of Nazare, the resulting satisfyingly chewy fish was charbroiled and served with plentiful slices of garlic, sweet peppers and black olives.</p>
        <p>A garnish of tender littlenecks ringed nuggets of pork Alentejo, so lean it bordered on dryness. A cavil:  we would have liked more leeks and less thickener in chicken Freixial, which was nicely seasoned with a julienne of ham.</p>
        <p>Entrees came with sides of rice and wholesome black beans.</p>
        <p>A volleyball-size concoction of meringue showered with caramel and almonds, called Molotov, proved scrumptious. And chocolate mousse and bread pudding were first rate. Studded with raisins and not shy on eggs, bread pudding was soft, warm and luscious. Presented in a goblet, a generous portion of fragrant chocolate mousse could not have been smoother. Pineapple mousse, however, bathed in a lovely fruity sauce, was itself bland and grainy. Fresh peach and pineapple topped a heavy fruit tart. Flan seemed ordinary.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $34 without drinks, tax and tip. Caravela is two blocks north of Main Street.</p>
        <p>Caravela  53 North Broadway, Tarrytown.  (914) 631-1863.</p>
