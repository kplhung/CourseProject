        <p>Two men were struck early yesterday by what the police described as needlelike objects fired by a group of men in a car in two incidents on the West Side.</p>
        <p>Neither man was seriously hurt in the incidents, which occurred about five minutes apart, and the police were unsure how the objects were fired, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Brian Burke.</p>
        <p>In the first incident, at 4:45 a.m. at 10th Avenue and West 52nd Street, Emanuel Linijak, 29, was hit in the arm. In the second, at 4:50 a.m. in front of 454 West 45th Street, Robert Brito, 32, was hit in the back, Sergeant Burke said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Linijak was treated at St. Clare's Hospital and released. Mr. Brito refused medical attention. Both men told the police that they thought the object that struck them came  from inside a green or gray four-door Honda. Neither victim could provide a license plate number for the car.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Linijak's case, a needle two and a half inches long was recovered as evidence. In the second incident, no needle or dart was recovered, the police said.</p>
        <p>Both victims told the police that there were three men in the car, whom they described as white or light-skinned Hispanics in their 20's.</p>
