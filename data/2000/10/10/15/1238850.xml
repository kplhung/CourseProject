        <p>Q: Some members of our condominium's board are arguing with some unit owners over whether a member of the board who is also the holder of unsold units in the condominium has the same rights as the original sponsor. This board member bought his apartments from the sponsor 16 years ago shortly after the plan was declared effective. He says that since the original sponsor has the right to sell or rent apartments without regard to the building's rules, he has that same right. May his tenants and the new owners of the apartments he sells disregard the rules of the condominium that the rest of us follow? . . .  Naomi Katcher, Manhattan.</p>

        <p>Q: Some members of our condominium's board are arguing with some unit owners over whether a member of the board who is also the holder of unsold units in the condominium has the same rights as the original sponsor. This board member bought his apartments from the sponsor 16 years ago shortly after the plan was declared effective. He says that since the original sponsor has the right to sell or rent apartments without regard to the building's rules, he has that same right. May his tenants and the new owners of the apartments he sells disregard the rules of the condominium that the rest of us follow? . . .  Naomi Katcher, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A: Howard Schechter, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that it is fairly common for a condominium's governing documents to give a sponsor certain rights and privileges -- including an exemption from rules on sales and sublets that bind other unit owners -- and that these rights may carry over to those who buy such units for investment. (In the case of a co-op, a sponsor would be a holder of unsold shares.)</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, Mr. Schechter said, the term holder of unsold units refers to an individual or business entity who has bought apartments in a condominium from the original sponsor or from a previous holder of unsold units and who has been specifically designated as a holder of unsold units by the sponsor.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, he said, if the condominium's governing documents contain a provision exempting the sponsor from certain rules and regulations, and if the sponsor has designated the board member in question as a holder of unsold units, then it is likely that the board member would be exempt from those regulations.  Since the rights of a sponsor vary from building to building, Mr. Schechter said, it would be necessary to examine the governing documents of the letter writer's condominium to determine which regulations a holder of unsold units is exempt from.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, since it is necessary for a holder of unsold units to be designated as such by the original sponsor, it is not likely that a third party who purchases an apartment from an existing holder of unsold units would have the same status. Tenants of a legitimate holder of unsold units, on the other hand, would likely be exempted from whatever rules the holder of unsold units is exempt from.</p>
        <p>Under current law, he said, an investor who occupies an apartment -- or anyone who buys an apartment for occupancy -- is no longer considered a holder of unsold units.</p>
        <p>When Co-op Work Dirties Another Unit</p>
        <p>Q: I live in a prewar co-op building.  The owner of the upstairs apartment has been doing some serious renovation work under a permit issued by the New York City Buildings Department. The renovation lasted six months and left my apartment and its contents covered with construction dust and debris. Three months into the renovation, I sent a letter telling the upstairs owner that when her construction was finished I expected her to take care of the damages caused to my apartment. After five months, I sent a second letter, and sent copies of both letters to the board of directors. The board members say they cannot do anything, but the building manager saw the situation in my apartment and told me to send a third letter listing the expense for the cleaning job. So far, she has not responded. What is my recourse? . . . Nuray Birol, Manhattan</p>
        <p>A: Ronni Lynn Arougheti, president of Heron Ltd., a Manhattan property management company, said that most co-ops required a shareholder to execute an alteration agreement before the co-op would permit renovation of a shareholder's apartment.</p>
        <p>With such an agreement, Ms. Arougheti said, it is typically possible for the board to intervene and perhaps even ensure that damage to other apartments is paid for by the shareholder doing the renovation. That can be done, she said, by requiring security deposits for damage claims and insurance for licensed contractors working in the apartment. However, she said, since the board has said that it cannot do anything about the situation, it is likely that an alteration agreement was not signed or required.</p>
        <p>And while the board nevertheless could and should attempt to negotiate a resolution of the situation between the shareholders, Ms. Arougheti said, the letter writer's only legal recourse would be to hire someone to clean the apartment and then take the upstairs neighbor to small claims court to recover the cost.</p>
