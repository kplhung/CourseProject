        <p>A VAST CONSPIRACY: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President, by Jeffrey Toobin. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $14.) In this account of how some unanswered questions about an Arkansas land deal led to the Starr report and the impeachment trial of President Clinton, the author argues that the legal system is increasingly supplanting the political system. The result is an ''admirably clear, vigorously written, plain-spoken and common-sensical book,'' Thomas Powers wrote here earlier this year. In Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush, by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Vintage, $8.99), two Texas journalists launch a relentless, if good-natured, broadside against the Republican presidential nominee, primarily taking aim at his record as governor and deal maker. ''It serves as a useful, opinionated brief for the prosecution,'' Peter Applebome said here earlier this year.</p>
        <p>MY FATHER, DANCING, by Bliss Broyard. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) The female protagonists in these eight stories struggle to emerge from their fathers' shadows as they venture from their privileged lives into the harsher glare of the outside world. The ''witty, worldly and literary'' father figures ''add weight and perspective to her collection,'' Allegra Goodman wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>MANDELA: The Authorized Biography, by Anthony Sampson. (Vintage, $17.) The South African leader is portrayed as a master of political imagery whose 27 years in prison transformed him from a warrior into an indispensable peacemaker. Last year our reviewer, John Carlin, called this ''a lasting monument to Mandela's imperishable greatness'' that ''demythologizes the man without in any way undermining his heroic stature.'' In The Last Trek -- A NEW BEGINNING: The Autobiography, by F. W. de Klerk (Trans-Atlantic, $19.95), the former president of South Africa recalls how his nation made the transition from apartheid to all-race democracy. ''De Klerk cannot be denied his place in history,'' Suzanne Daley said here in 1999, and while his memoir is not personally revealing, ''it does make clear that the individual who began undoing the Afrikaner empire was the ultimate product of generations of Afrikaner politics.''</p>
        <p>THE PLEASING HOUR, by Lily King. (Scribner, $12.) The heroine of this first novel is a nave American who flees a personal trauma by taking a job as an au pair in France and becoming involved with her new family. ''Most writers are good at depicting either intricate social ambiguities or more primitive urges,'' Jacqueline Carey wrote here last year. ''King proves herself equally adept at both.''</p>
        <p>THE LAST LIFE, by Claire Messud. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) In tracing her complex past, this novel's prematurely wise narrator recounts the conflicted history of the French who returned from Algeria in the 1950's and 60's to become refugees in their own homeland. Her story ''is a sad one, as stories of displacement usually are, and Messud is ambitious in her attempt to explore the colonial experience of Algeria through the prism of one family in the south of France,'' Suzanne Berne said here last year.</p>
        <p>THE HOLOCAUST IN AMERICAN LIFE, by Peter Novick. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $15.) A historian speculates about how and why the Holocaust has moved to the center of American consciousness in the last 25 years. ''Novick's sensible if unpopular conclusion'' is that ''we should study a historical event like the Holocaust not to extract lessons but to appreciate its complexities and contradictions,'' Lawrence L. Langer said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>WALKIN' THE DOG, by Walter Mosley. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95.) This collection of stories revolves around an unlikely hero, Socrates Fortlow, an ex-con and streetwise philosopher struggling to maintain hope and survive on the streets of Watts. '' 'Walkin' the Dog' is as much moral fable as it is social fiction,'' Adam Goodheart wrote here in 1999. Mosley ''lets his characters make their own mistakes, and narrates their rough lives in a gentle voice.''</p>
        <p>GOTHIC: Four Hundred Years of Excess, Horror, Evil and Ruin, by Richard Davenport-Hines. (North Point/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $15.) This survey of the Gothic sensibility covers everything from the 1631 eruption of Vesuvius to David Lynch's films. ''Full of amusing digressions and offhandedly sweeping opinions, the book leaps from one discipline to another,'' Ted Loos said here last year.</p>
        <p>SAY GOODBYE: The Laurie Moss Story, by Lewis Shiner. (St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.) An obsessive journalist tells the vivid tale of a Texas singer-songwriter who scrambles up and down the ladder of musical success. In 1999 our reviewer, Mark Athitakis, called this ''a fine novel about rock 'n' roll.''</p>
