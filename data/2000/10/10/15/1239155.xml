        <p>After more than two weeks of spiraling violence that cost nearly 100 lives, Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed today to meet with President Clinton in Egypt to seek a truce and perhaps even a way back to the peace table.</p>
        <p>The high-stakes meeting, announced here by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, is scheduled for Monday in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. Given the delicacy of the situation, however, plans could still go awry..</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, who has shuttled between Jerusalem and Gaza City against a backdrop of rioting, lynch mobs and rockets, suggested that the two sides start by cooling tensions that continued on a low broil today in the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Hebron.</p>
        <p>''The shooting should simply stop,'' Mr. Annan said.</p>
        <p>In the face of intense international pressure, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, dropped his central precondition for a meeting. He had demanded an international inquiry into the recent violence, which Israel rejected, saying a fact-finding team made up of Palestinians, Israelis and Americans would suffice.</p>
        <p>But Palestinian officials said their preconditions would merely metamorphose into conditions at the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>And given how badly the fragile trust between the two sides has been ruptured in the last 16 days, the meeting is bound to be a tense exercise in breaking down intransigent positions.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials warned that the consequences of a failed meeting would be devastating. ''If it fails, all hell will break loose,'' Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said in an anxious voice.</p>
        <p>It has been a month since the Sept. 13 deadline that Israel and the Palestinians had set for achieving a permanent peace accord and settling all the contentious issues between them. In that month, a negotiating stalemate has deteriorated into the most severe violence here in years, threatening the accomplishments of seven years of peacemaking and the very concept of peace itself.</p>
        <p>Against that backdrop, the summit meeting is at best a weighty challenge and at worst a risky venture.</p>
        <p>In a brief statement at the White House, President Clinton acknowledged the challenge, speaking three months after a 15-day summit meeting at Camp David failed in its goal of producing an accord.</p>
        <p>''We should be under no illusions,'' he said. ''The good news is the parties have agreed to meet, but the path ahead is difficult.''</p>
        <p>Rhetorically, both sides still say they are committed to peace. But if the meeting were to produce an end to the fighting, that would be an accomplishment.</p>
        <p>Experts say it could take a long time to rebuild a negotiating relationship after the extreme collapse in trust these last two weeks.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said that they believed that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, concerned that the violence would spread, played a major role in persuading the Palestinian leader to drop his objections to a meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak had originally opposed the convening of an Israeli-Palestinian meeting before an Arab world summit meeting that is scheduled to open next Saturday. But he changed his mind.</p>
        <p>''We know that Mubarak kept calling Arafat all the time,'' said Nachman Shai, a government spokesman. ''In the Arab world, there has been much concern about what happened here. Egypt, Jordan suddenly realized that this wave of violence might not be contained to the West Bank and Gaza and might spread into their own countries in a destablilizing way.''</p>
        <p>Western diplomats here believe that it was Mr. Annan who, spearheading an international intervention effort, played the pivotal role.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, who wants the peace effort to draw in more international institutions and foreign nations to dilute America's dominant role, responded well to Mr. Annan's entreaties, his associates said. ''Does this give the U.N. the camel's nose under the tent to participate in the peace process?'' a diplomat said. ''By merit, it might. And that is definitely what the Palestinians want.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan said today that while the two sides set no preconditions for the talks, they did make ''suggestions.''</p>
        <p>The Palestinians claimed today that they succeeded, through Mr. Annan, in persuading the Israelis to loosen border restrictions to permit the flow of emergency supplies from Egypt and Jordan.</p>
        <p>But the Israeli Foreign Ministry sent out a bold-type fax protesting that Israel has never blocked the delivery of aid.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians are also pressing for Israel to withdraw its tanks from the West Bank, where the Palestinians say they are terrorizing and provoking the population.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said they would probably be able to accept that demand -- in Sharm, and not before.</p>
        <p>''That is something we will not fight on,'' Mr. Shai said.</p>
        <p>Israel, though, is pushing for the Palestinians to rearrest dozens of Islamic fundamentalist group members who were released from prison this week.</p>
        <p>In Nablus, a spokesman for Hamas, the leading Islamic group, said that the Palestinians had indeed started complying with that request.</p>
        <p>''Fourteen of our 40 members who were released this week have been summoned by Palestinian security,'' said Sheikh Jamal Salim. ''To the best of my knowledge, they are back in jail.''</p>
        <p>Journalists in Nablus, however, said that they think that many of the men have ''disappeared'' rather than turn themselves back in.</p>
        <p>For Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the summit meeting is a political risk as well as a diplomatic one. He has proposed forming a national emergency government with the right-wing opposition. But his negotiations with the rightists are frozen as he prepares to head to Egypt. While the right wing backs his effort to end the violence, it would not support him if he took extra steps to revive the peace effort. So the meeting on Monday is a juggling act, given his shaky hold on power.</p>
        <p>The Israelis also seem to be nervous that a terrorist attack by Islamic militants could yet thwart the Monday meeting. State television said tonight that the country would be on a heightened terror alert on Sunday.</p>
        <p>In his weekly radio address, President Clinton stated flatly that ''ending the violence and getting the people of the Middle East back to dialogue will be hard after what has happened.''</p>
        <p>He stressed however that ''the effort must continue with America's strong support.''</p>
        <p>''We must do so because we have a profound national interest in peace in the Middle East and a very special bond to the state of Israel,'' the president added.</p>
        <p>The presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, welcomed the news of the Middle East meeting. At a campaign speech in Detroit today, Mr. Gore said he was praying for the families of the American soldiers killed and injured in Yemen, and for the success of the Monday meeting. ''I think that we need a lot of prayers to make sure that meeting is a success,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush issued a statement from his ranch in Texas: ''I welcome this development. I hope that Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Barak will do everything possible to stop the violence so that our longstanding goal of peace in the Middle East can be achieved.''</p>
        <p>Arab leaders have also engaged in intense diplomacy in recent days to try to end the violence. In Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah II of Jordan met King Fahd today, a Jordanian source told Agence France-Presse.</p>
        <p>But Israeli and Palestinian officials say it will be difficult for the two sides to face each other with the ugly images of the last week fresh in their minds -- the Palestinian mob killings of two Israeli reserve soldiers in Ramallah followed by the Israeli helicopter gunship attacks on Ramallah and Gaza City. ''At this moment, I think it will even be hard for us to look them in the eyes,'' a senior Palestinian official said.</p>
        <p>Some Palestinians condemn the summit meeting as a move to quash what they see as their war of independence. Most are skeptical.</p>
        <p>''I don't hope much from this,'' said Fatma Shamalekh, a Gaza resident whose son, Marwan, was shot dead by Israeli troops on Oct. 6. ''How can we talk about peace when the Israelis are killing our young people?''</p>
        <p>In the Old City, an Israeli and a Palestinian ended a heated, finger-pointing discussion by agreeing that the leaders must find a way out of the crisis.</p>
        <p>''See, we can reach agreement, so can they,'' said Ibrahim Abu Salim, a shopkeeper.</p>
        <p>Yonatan Friedberg, describing himself as a ''disillusioned peace camper.'' said: ''What's the alternative? We use war planes, they use suicide bombs and we all go up in flames and down in smoke? Peace -- that is another story. But a cease-fire is something our leaders should have the common sense to accomplish.''</p>
