        <p>JOSEPH R. PERELLA is half of the most famous pair to hit Wall Street in the modern deal-making era. But the announcement of his promotion last month at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, from chief of investment banking to chairman of the institutional securities group, was overshadowed by rumors of huge losses -- later revealed to be smaller than feared -- in the firm's bond department.</p>
        <p>The scant notice was fine with Mr. Perella, who only reluctantly grants interviews. In his new job, though, clients will probably see more of him.</p>
        <p>At 59, he is now the firm's senior ambassador to corporate clients, a role inherited from Morgan Stanley's longtime chairman, Richard Fisher, who retired in 1999. It is a natural evolution for Mr. Perella, who joined Morgan Stanley seven years ago. He is eager to give up his administrative duties and for the last three years has groomed his deputy, Terry Meguid, to take his place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perella describes his new job as appropriate for his age, but not a means for him to ease out of the business. ''It is a position in which I can grow older gracefully,'' he said, ''in a business that causes people to burn out at a young age.'' Yet he expects to travel more, not less, particularly in Europe and Japan.</p>
        <p>Friends and associates confirm that he still works long hours. ''I called his office at midnight sometime in the last few months to leave him a voice mail, because I didn't want to call him at home and wake him up,'' one lawyer said. ''To my surprise, he was still there.''</p>
        <p>Besides deal-making, Mr. Perella wants to focus on being a mentor to young bankers. The most celebrated example of this skill came in 1977: At what was then First Boston, Mr. Perella recruited a young lawyer named Bruce Wasserstein. Two years later, Mr. Perella stunned his boss by asking him to make Mr. Wasserstein co-head of mergers and acquisitions -- Mr. Perella's equal. In 1988, the pair formed Wasserstein Perella &amp; Company, which became one of the most prominent mergers-and-acquisitions advisers.</p>
        <p>''We used to joke that we were his children,'' said Mack Rossoff, a banker who worked with Mr. Perella at First Boston and Wasserstein Perella. Mr. Perella is married with no children of his own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perella himself came to Wall Street at 31, after six years of professional obscurity. He grew up in Newark and received a bachelor's degree in accounting from Lehigh University. He worked as an accountant, then did stints in the Air Force and at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1972, Mr. Perella joined First Boston and found his niche. He was quickly named head of mergers and acquisitions, then a backwater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perella's direct style captivated chief executives and colleagues alike. A lanky 6-foot-4, he is gregarious and sometimes disarmingly quirky.</p>
        <p>''Joe was having problems with his back,'' recalled J. Tomilson Hill, who worked for Mr. Perella in the 1970's and is now a senior managing director at the Blackstone Group, a merchant bank. ''We were in the middle of complicated negotiations, and all of a sudden Joe gets up and lies down on the floor. He continued talking from the floor. Only Joe could get away with that.''</p>
        <p>In the heat of a deal, however, Mr. Perella can show flashes of temper. ''He's a very passionate guy,'' one former associate said.</p>
        <p>By now, Mr. Perella has done so many deals that he regularly has to prune his conference room collection of the Lucite mementos that many bankers treasure. But there are also a few wilder touches: his Ferrari memorabilia, for example. Mr. Perella, who owns four vintage Ferraris, has visited the automaker's factory and boasts a check signed by the company's founder, Enzo Ferrari; the check was a gift from a client.</p>
        <p>At Morgan Stanley, Mr. Perella has used his Rolodex and his charm to win business, including a lucrative relationship with Time Warner. Mr. Perella knew the company's chief executive, Gerald M. Levin, from Wasserstein Perella's work on the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1989. Soon after Mr. Perella arrived at Morgan Stanley, Time Warner hired him to bolster its defenses after a sizable investment by Seagram. Morgan Stanley has since represented Time Warner on nearly every transaction, including, most notably, the pending merger with America Online, the largest deal so far in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perella stressed  that he was not involved in all the details. ''When I was 40, I loved being in the thick of putting a deal together,'' he said. ''What I like now is engaging with decision makers at the highest levels,'' he said. In the AOL deal, the day-to-day work is handled by the media bankers Jeffrey Sine and Paul Taubman.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Perella won Morgan Stanley the initial public offering for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. ''I have known Martha for 10 years,'' he said. ''She trusts me. In addition, she went to the junior prom with my cousin Arthur.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart, his Hamptons neighbor, rates him highly by diverse standards. ''We talk about food a lot,'' she said. ''He has a lovely kitchen in East Hampton that is well used. You can see the same low-key confidence in his cooking and in his business dealings.''</p>
        <p>One deal that Mr. Perella did miss involved his old firm, Wasserstein Perella, which last month announced its pending acquisition by Dresdner Bank for $1.6 billion. When Mr. Perella left the firm in 1993, he sold all his stock, although, for contractual reasons, his name stayed on the door.</p>
        <p>Friends of Mr. Wasserstein and Mr. Perella said the two parted on frosty terms. ''It was a volatile marriage to begin with, and that was complicated by a weak M.&amp; A. environment in the early 90's,'' a former Wasserstein Perella banker said. The firm fell in the adviser rankings after  publicity about some ill-fated deals.</p>
        <p>Still, both are diplomatic today. ''Joe and I respect each other,'' Mr. Wasserstein said. ''We both love this business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perella would not say much about his ex-partner, but he smiled faintly at the thought of the huge riches that Mr. Wasserstein was about to gain. ''It's a great deal,'' Mr. Perella said.</p>
