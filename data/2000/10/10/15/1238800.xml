        <p>PERHAPS it is because I left my country, Cuba, at 16, but when I travel I search for home. I don't mean I actually look at real estate listings, although I've been known to do that. My quest is more spiritual than physical.</p>
        <p>I don't need to own an apartment overlooking La Plaza Mayor in Madrid, I only need to know that I could, that my soul has connected with the city of my travels -- wherever that may be.</p>
        <p>This connection is the true test of whether or not my trip has been successful. Can I live here? I wonder at the end of every trip. The answer, more often than not, is yes.</p>
        <p>The impulse to stay came to me first during a trip to Costa Rica in 1988, my first foray outside the United States as a working journalist. It caught me by surprise, as I waited for a cab on the driveway of my hotel in downtown San Jose.</p>
        <p>The trip had been uneventful. San Jose is a quiet, even muted city of well-mannered people and low buildings. A few parks and interesting buildings make a stroll worth any traveler's time.</p>
        <p>But for tourists the city functions best as a way station to the rest of the country and its lush mountains, active volcanoes and pristine beaches.</p>
        <p>Yet, my connection with Costa Rica happened as I caught a whiff of the fumes from the idling tourist buses at the curbside. A wave of heat trapped underneath the hotel portico collided with the thick black fumes and washed over me. And, right there, I encountered the smell from home. More than a smell, it was a sensation that transported me to Havana, to the countless hours I waited for a bus in the heat of the city. And I thought, yes, I could live here.</p>
        <p>After that, San Jose charmed me in other ways. Driving in rush-hour traffic one day, for example, I found myself right next to then President Oscar Arias, who was driving his own car in the next lane without a bodyguard. And later I did visit the volcanoes and the mountains, laced with gorgeous coffee plantations. I've never been back, but when I think of San Jose, it is the the smell of a sticky September morning that I remember.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, though, I find connections in more pleasant sights and sensations. During my first trip to Madrid, as I waited on Alcala Street for a friend to take me to dinner, I caught a quick movement from the corner of my eye. To the right, on a second floor, a white lace curtain had closed and a soft yellow light turned on. It was cold, I remember, so cold that the soles of my feet, ill protected in leather boots and cotton socks bought in sunny Miami, were freezing.</p>
        <p>But I stood there, my heart beating faster, eyes fixed on the window, trying to imagine who lived in that apartment and what was happening behind the curtain. It probably was time for dinner or for a child to complete her homework. But I chose to believe that a poet, inspired by his muse, had left his noisy, cluttered living room and retired to the privacy of a studio to write. If I strained my ears and stood on my toes, I thought, I could almost hear the fountain pen against the paper, verses flowing from his window onto the street below.</p>
        <p>By the time my friend arrived, I was in love with Madrid and yes, I thought, I could live here.</p>
        <p>Some places are easier than others. It doesn't take much to fall in love with London's misty mornings, Buenos Aires's wide avenues, Pretoria's summer light in January or Paris at twilight.</p>
        <p>I have often dreamed of living next to the Charles Bridge in Prague, crossing that bridge back and forth on the way to and from work. And the Danube? Who wouldn't want to sit at an outdoor cafe by the river in Budapest every afternoon, drinking coffee and reading until dark?</p>
        <p>But I have connected with far less sophisticated places. I have found home in Queretaro, a small town near Mexico City, where the houses are painted deep pink and cobalt blue; and in the mountains of Merida, Venezuela, where I once met an engineer who had abandoned his career and his posh apartment in Caracas for a hut with a garden where he could plant fruits and flowers.</p>
        <p>HIS home was so simple, so enchanting, I wanted to stay. The familiar tug in my heart occurred while climbing the steps of the bell tower in an old Calvinist church in Geneva and, curiously, traveling in a train at night through the snowy mountains of Switzerland en route to charming Gstaad, a site so unrelated to my idea of home that the connection is inexplicable.</p>
        <p>It is the poetry that attracts me, I'm convinced: the romance of an old-fashioned train trip, the chance encounter in a cafe, the mystery of a door left ajar, the history behind a torn wall, the aesthetics of a flower pot positioned just so outside a window.</p>
        <p>Or, sometimes, it is the energy of a city, something in the air that is neither mysterious nor romantic, something intractable that makes me want to stay and explore or return and make a home.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the desire is so clear, the pull so strong, that it happens, the city of my travels becomes home. The first time I came to New York was in March 1988. The newspaper I worked for in Florida had sent me to cover a meeting at the United Nations. It was a short trip and, after completing the assignment, I had about half a day to explore. Ignoring the tourist sites, I set off to walk north from my hotel on 42nd Street, with a vague idea that I wanted to visit the Guggenheim Museum. By the time I arrived at the Guggenheim, more than 40 blocks north on 88th Street, the museum was closed. I walked all the way back to my hotel by a different route, down Fifth Avenue. More than walking, I soon realized, I was letting the city, the people rushing around me, sweep me along.</p>
        <p>Caught up in the energy, the moment, the forward movement of this city that so intimidates some tourists, I was exhilarated. Somewhere around 66th Street, I fell in  love with New York and I thought, yes, I definitely could live here. And now that  I do, the Guggenheim is only seven blocks from home.</p>
