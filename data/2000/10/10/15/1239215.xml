        <p>As a Texan, Roger Clemens is straight from the western movies, the hired gun brought in to restore law and order.</p>
        <p>He comes and goes in the clubhouse like a specter. Now you see him, now you don't. Grabs his clothes from his locker and dresses in some back room.</p>
        <p>Up to last night, Clemens had lacked that one signature game, the epic beating in the public square that established his control of the general populace.</p>
        <p>The clinching game in last year's World Series almost didn't count because the Braves had been so down, but last night's occasionally brutal stomping of the Mariners by a 5-0 score was the reason the Yankees imported Clemens in 1999.</p>
        <p>''His graduation,'' was the way Reggie Jackson, a man who understands October, put it after Clemens pitched a one-hitter with 15 strikeouts to put the Yankees in total control of this series.</p>
        <p>The burly dude from Katy, Tex., Clemens had the gall to take command in the very first inning. After striking out the first two batters, he threw a pitch high and inside to Alex Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>It was not as high or as tight as the pitch that conked Mike Piazza during an interleague game with the Mets during the summer. That one sent Piazza out with a concussion, and has had the Mets and their fans fuming ever since.</p>
        <p>It is Clemens's reputation. He did not invent the art form, but merely practices it in an age when free agents flit from club to club, and everybody is somebody's former teammate, and opponents have mutual agents, and stars like Rodriguez and Derek Jeter call each other something between brother and good friend.</p>
        <p>In this day and age, the pitcher who goes high and tight with a nasty fastball is a throwback to another time. In the not-too-recent past, such practitioners carried it off with an admirable crabbiness like Bob Gibson or disarming bonhomie like Don Drysdale, but Clemens goes it alone.</p>
        <p>The trouble with this rep is that nobody gives him any benefit of the doubt. Jackson, still a member of the sprawling Yankee organization, said he asked Clemens about the inside pitches during the game.</p>
        <p>''Roger said to me, 'Reggie, I can't control my fastball,' '' Jackson said. ''He hadn't started in six days.''</p>
        <p>Maybe, maybe not. Rodriguez went spinning out of the batter's box, directing a doleful stare at Clemens. And in the Mariners' dugout, Lou Piniella's tight jaw line began yapping an angry tune, which did not subside when the game was over.</p>
        <p>''Give him credit,'' Piniella said with sincerity, but then adding, ''if he wants his batters to get hit, that's exactly what we'll do.''</p>
        <p>Piniella knows the drill. His pitchers have been known to plunk the Yankees, particularly Paul O'Neill, with whom he has a 10-year mutual disdain. There was a game in the old Kingdome a few years ago when everybody seemed to know that Randy Johnson was going to buzz O'Neill, who then batted third in the lineup. Johnson did, and World War III somehow did not erupt.</p>
        <p>''I love Lou, he's very animated,'' Joe Torre said afterward, ''but Paul O'Neill's had to have his uniform cleaned, and I never accused Lou of anything.''</p>
        <p>Then Torre added, ''Don't get me wrong, when Roger pitched for other teams, he annoyed me, too.''</p>
        <p>Did the high-and-tight pitches set a tone? Rodriguez said it was ''puzzling'' how Clemens could be wild inside but not outside, and he said he was ''angry,'' but that he would get over it. It was too late. The Mariners had already been intimidated.</p>
        <p>''I would like to think that a good young player like Alex Rodriguez would do something about it,'' Reggie said later.</p>
        <p>You mean, like charging the mound or dragging a bunt, like the old-timers did?</p>
        <p>''I mean, smashing a line drive somewhere,'' Jackson said.</p>
        <p>Let the record say that after Rodriguez walked, Edgar Martinez popped up to end the first inning, which is almost always Clemens's most difficult. If he gets through that, he tends to bully the opposition late into the game. He did that again, even throwing a Charles Oakley-type elbow as Al Martin approached from behind on a close play at first base.</p>
        <p>Clemens was all about establishing his territory. One could imagine the Mets, after their loss to the Cardinals, driving home in their vans, following Clemens's little messages to the Mariners, and perhaps to themselves.</p>
        <p>At the age of 38, Clemens is the only pitcher to win five Cy Young awards, but he has never pitched a no-hitter, coming close with a one-hitter 12 years ago. He said he tried not to think about the no-hitter, before or after.</p>
        <p>The no-hitter vanished in the seventh, when Martin lashed a line drive down the first-base line, ticking off the glove of Tino Martinez, who was perfectly extended.</p>
        <p>With 15 strikeouts, Clemens did not allow for many fielding chances. He softened up the Mariners early, and stomped them late. This was exactly why he was brought into the Yankees' encampment, not for sociability, but for the security of one crushing enforcer who last night graduated to the level of men who have owned a bit of October.</p>
