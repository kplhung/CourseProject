        <p>When Commack (5-0) defeated Brentwood in the first week of the season, it was considered an upset. Since then, Commack had not had a chance to prove it was a legitimate contender.</p>
        <p>Commack not only proved itself yesterday with a 40-13 victory over previously unbeaten Sachem (4-1), but it also secured first place in Suffolk's Division I.</p>
        <p>The Cougars' defense shut down Sachem's powerful running game and continually pressured Sachem's quarterback, preventing the offense from getting comfortable.</p>
        <p>Scott Shukrie, a senior defensive end, had two of Commack's four sacks, and interceptions by the senior Bryan Tornee and the junior Keith Conners gave Commack's offense good field position. Mike Prahalis, the senior quarterback, converted those turnovers into touchdowns. Tornee had 3 catches for 68 yards and a touchdown.</p>
        <p>Edgemont (6-0) ran over Albertus Magnus (1-5), 62-0, behind one of the best backfields in Westchester. The combination of Matt Bernstein at fullback and Joey Tarasiewicz at tailback has given Edgemont a spotless record.</p>
        <p>Bernstein is the top rusher in Westchester's Section I with 1,092 yards on 64 carries, and Tarasiewicz is ranked third with 922 yards on 44 carries.</p>
        <p>As a result of some of Edgemont's lopsided victories, neither Bernstein nor Tarasiewicz sees much action in the second halves of games, making their numbers more staggering. Yesterday, Bernstein ran 7 times for 189 yards and touchdowns of 87, 3, 56 and 16 yards. Tarasiewicz ran 6 times for 172 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>Other members of the Bernstein family have been involved as well. Alex Bernstein, a junior linebacker, intercepted a pass and ran it back 30 yards. Ben Bernstein, a freshman who will most likely replace his brother Matt in the backfield next season, had his first varsity score, a 35-yard touchdown run.</p>
        <p>Fordham Prep (5-1) beat up on Cardinal Spellman (1-3), 52-14. David Bailey, a senior wide receiver, and David Schwam, a junior running back, each returned kickoffs for touchdowns and the senior quarterback Matt Rinklin threw for 209 yards and 3 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>It was three-and-out all day for Floral Park in another battle of Long Island unbeatens as Bethpage (5-0) allowed no first downs in the first half and only two on the day in a 34-0 victory. Steven Bofill, a senior linebacker, and Vinnie Valente, a junior linebacker, combined for 15 tackles and 3 sacks in the shutout, and Bofill also ran the ball 13 times for 138 yards and a touchdown.</p>
        <p>It was a big day for Baldwin (2-3) football, bigger than a 14-0 defeat of Plainview J.F.K. (1-4) might suggest. The senior running back Sean Treasure broke the career rushing record at Baldwin, set in 1991 by Eugene Culbreath, as he added to his career total, which now is 2,928 yards. Inside linebacker Matt Berg, who had 18 tackles and recovered a fumble, led the Baldwin defense.</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>Mark Zambrano starred on both sides of the ball as CEDAR GROVE (5-0) defeated PINGRY (3-2), 29-14. Zambrano, a junior fullback and linebacker, ran 13 times for 49 yards and a touchdown, caught 3 passes for 27 yards and a touchdown, and led the defense with eight solo tackles and seven assists. Cedar Grove also had help from its senior quarterback, Rob Gogerty, who completed 13 passes for 185 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 42-yard scoring strike to the sophomore wide receiver Kosie Remy to put Cedar Grove ahead, 14-0, in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Touted DELBARTON (5-0) survived a scare on Friday night as it needed two overtimes to defeat ORANGE (3-3), 42-35. Orange came back from a 14-0 first-quarter deficit because of the exploits of its senior quarterback, Abbri Jones, who ran for 289 yards and a touchdown, and passed for 183 yards and 4 touchdowns. Orange had the lead with less than a minute left, but Delbarton quarterback Mike Loree found receiver Jeff Parros for the tying touchdown with 48 seconds left. In the second overtime, Loree found receiver Jarrett Schreck for a 15-yard touchdown that won the game and avoided the upset.</p>
        <p>Ricky Cook, a senior running back, had 29 carries for 231 yards and 3 touchdowns as MONTCLAIR (3-2) defeated PASSAIC (0-6), 41-7.</p>
        <p>PREPS</p>
        <p>PENNINGTON (4-1) scored the deciding points of its victory over RIVERDALE (3-2) on the first play of the game. Drew Rucks, a senior, ran the opening kickoff 78 yards to give Pennington a 6-0 lead. It was all it needed in a 12-0 victory.</p>
        <p>MORRISTOWN BEARD handed HACKLEY its first loss of the season, 33-26. Jason Garrett, a senior running back, had two touchdowns and Jesse Jeffers, a junior running back, also had two scores in the victory.</p>
        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>CHESHIRE ACADEMY (3-1) beat FORMAN (1-2), 34-12, behind running back Geoff Ferguson, who ran 20 times for 241 yards and 3 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>Led by the senior running back Rob Schaffer, HOTCHKISS (4-0) defeated AVON OLD FARMS (3-2), 51-28. Schaffer carried 34 times for 242 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
