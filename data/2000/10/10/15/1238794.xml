        <p>A HOUSE IN EARNEST</p>
        <p>By Terry Farish.</p>
        <p>Steerforth, paper, $13.</p>
        <p>For those of a certain age, reading Terry Farish's new novel will be like traveling through a time warp. We are all young, narcissistic and ill formed again, struggling to reach something we might call integrity, however we define it at the moment. Since it's the 70's, there are obsessions about sex and dope and most of the characters are arrogant and self-absorbed. The shadow of Vietnam hangs over everything, and on the day the author opens her narrative in Portsmouth, N. H., Saigon falls to the North Vietnamese. The book traces the on-again, off-again relationship between Christy, a 29-year-old Vietnam veteran with a phobia about land mines, and Deborah, a 19-year-old who is described as ''more serious than she wanted to be'' and who complains about being greatly misunderstood by her mother. The two become sporadic lovers and accidental parents of a son, Ian. ''A House in Earnest'' moves back and forth through time, following the piecemeal lives of its characters as they try to add everything up to a coherent whole. For most, it's not easy. ''I feel like all I ever do is have endings,'' complains one woman desperate for something that will endure. ''Even beginnings are endings.'' But some, particularly Ian and Patience, the daughter of ''one of the wealthy, lost girls'' then scattered through the New Hampshire woods, seem to reach some valuable understanding about themselves and about how they relate to the world. Perhaps they will drag others (notably their parents) to such an understanding as well. Perhaps not. The selfishness that runs deep through most of the novel's characters often makes it hard to care.</p>
