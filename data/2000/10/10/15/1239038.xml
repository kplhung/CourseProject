        <p>LIKE Abraham and his tribe, the New Schul and its rabbi wandered the lunar month from Rosh Hashana (the New Year) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), through the harvest festival of Sukkot and then Simhat Torah, which falls next Saturday and completes the year's reading of the Torah.</p>
        <p>During that period, this downtown congregation, not yet two years old, gathered and regathered, sometimes at the Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square, where Hebrew prayers mingled with sunlight pouring through stained-glass crosses in the windows, sometimes in a bland classroom at the New School on West 12th Street, where everyone sat on molded plastic chairs, and sometimes at a Jewish community center on East 10th Street. Prayer books and skullcaps, Torah and ark, were hauled from place to place, and people occasionally showed up red-faced and panting, having gone first to the wrong address.</p>

        <p>LIKE Abraham and his tribe, the New Schul and its rabbi wandered the lunar month from Rosh Hashana (the New Year) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), through the harvest festival of Sukkot and then Simhat Torah, which falls next Saturday and completes the year's reading of the Torah.</p>
        <p>During that period, this downtown congregation, not yet two years old, gathered and regathered, sometimes at the Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square, where Hebrew prayers mingled with sunlight pouring through stained-glass crosses in the windows, sometimes in a bland classroom at the New School on West 12th Street, where everyone sat on molded plastic chairs, and sometimes at a Jewish community center on East 10th Street. Prayer books and skullcaps, Torah and ark, were hauled from place to place, and people occasionally showed up red-faced and panting, having gone first to the wrong address.</p>
        <p>In most respects, the New Schul's problems finding a home are those of any newcomer to town during the present real estate boom. But its collective effort and resourcefulness are especially striking in that most of the 200 or so congregants are doing this for a religion and a God they aren't sure they believe in.</p>
        <p>Judaism has always been a disputatious faith. Jacob wrestled an angel into submission, even after, as the Bible explicitly notes, he suffered a dislocated hip. Moses smashed the tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments to make a point. But argument is not rejection, and for many at the New Schul, rejection is too energetic a word for lives lived with no connection to organized religion.</p>
        <p>As a result, many in the congregation express surprise and even confusion at their engagement with the New Schul, which contrasts strikingly with the self-assuredness they display about their professional and social lives. As one former publishing executive said, ''The prayers, you know, speaking those words, it's strange.'' Even one founder, a Greenwich Village songwriter named Holly Gewandter, said she often found herself thinking: ''I don't even believe in God. Why am I doing this?''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Rabbi Niles Goldstein, a solidly built 34-year-old black belt in karate with a scholarly interest in Jewish mysticism, is the sort of man who finds traces of God everywhere. He recently wrote a book, ''God at the Edge: Searching for the Divine in Uncomfortable and Unexpected Places'' (Crown, 2000), a kind of religious autobiography in which he finds evidence of the divine from a New York prison, to Kazakhstan, to the Arctic wilderness, to the murky depths of his sexual being.</p>
        <p>The rabbi seems delighted by his congregation. ''If you asked them, 9 out of 10 people at the New Schul would say, 'I'm not religious,' '' he said cheerfully. ''They would also say they don't believe in God. It's a challenge, serving this community that is ambivalent about what I've dedicated my life to. These are people I care about, who I can learn from. They aren't means to an end. They are, like me, searching and struggling and committing themselves to an enterprise, religion, that challenges people more deeply than any other human institution.''</p>
        <p>The New Schul has no board. Instead there is a vad, a self-elected group (the sole requirement for membership is showing up at monthly meetings) that collectively runs the organization.</p>
        <p>Similarly, services are intended to engage congregants as participants in a spiritual community. At Rosh Hashana, for example, members commented at length on a Hebrew poem and a song by Leonard Cohen, both written in response to the troubling story of Abraham, commanded by God to kill his son Isaac as a test of faith. What did this story mean? Could God's command be justified? To some, it could not.</p>
        <p>At Yom Kippur, a woman read, in a quiet, tremulous voice, a meditation on the story of Jonah and the whale. She told of growing up like Madeleine Albright and Tom Stoppard, also children of Czech Jews who were never told that they were Jewish. And she spoke of her bitterness at discovering her heritage, only to find that the religion comprised not just a remarkable ethical and philosophical tradition, and the miraculous tale of an enduring people, but was also the domain of a deity whose actions she rejected.</p>
        <p>''I felt duped,'' she told the congregation, and is struggling to make peace with that.</p>
        <p>Religions are founded on a glimpse of a transcendent something. That thing, whatever it is, is commonly found far from the beaten path. A desert will do fine, so will a forest, as will a mountaintop.</p>
        <p>Cities, by contrast, are filled with people and passion, goods and services, and it can be hard to see the stars, much less God. No wonder they come off poorly in the world's religious texts. Sodom and Gomorrah come to mind.</p>
        <p>And yet cities, to paraphrase the bank robber Willie Sutton, are where the people are, and where, arguably, the sense of community, purpose and morality that religion seeks to provide are most needed, as the nomads of the New Schul attest.</p>
