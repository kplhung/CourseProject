        <p>Marimac Vineyards occupies ''an amazing California site'' in one of New Jersey's most favorable fruit-growing areas, in Gary C. Pavlis's judgment.</p>
        <p>The seasoned opinion of Dr. Pavlis, the Atlantic County agricultural agent in Rutgers's Cooperative Extension, is the second reason Marimac, in Bridgeton in Cumberland County, deserves attention.</p>
        <p>The first reason is the quality of both its regular '98 chambourcin, made from estate-grown grapes, and its '98 chambourcin reserve, from grapes purchased in Vineland. (Each wine costs $13 at the winery.)</p>
        <p>William Emenheiser, Marimac's winemaker and a partner, has a way with chambourcin, perhaps the most interesting French hybrid red grape in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Still young, the aromatic regular bottling has a sultry, tarry aroma with elusive hints of berries. It is soft like merlot, and the fruit, accompanied by lively acidity, is mostly up front. Use it with Monday dinner.</p>
        <p>The stylish reserve bottling is for Sunday dinner. Its bouquet is perfumed and berrylike; the body is fleshy and mouth-filling; the beguiling, concentrated flavor is a bit herbal and conveys vanillan from the barrel.</p>
        <p>Marimac, first planted in 1992 and bonded in August 1998, lies on the Cohansey River about two miles from Delaware Bay. Production is 750 cases a year.</p>
        <p>''The favorable climate produced by the two bodies of water, along with deep, well-drained sandy loam soils, provides us with the opportunity to produce wines of great promise,'' Mr. Emenheiser said.</p>
        <p>''We have over four acres in production, with cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, chardonnay, riesling, pinot gris'' and the chambourcin, he said. ''Additional acreage was recently planted with chardonnay. Ultimately, we envision utilizing approximately 10 acres for planting.''</p>
        <p>If that's insufficient, Marimac may try to induce local apple and peach growers to convert to grapes. That's what happens in California.</p>
