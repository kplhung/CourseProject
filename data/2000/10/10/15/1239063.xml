        <p>DAZZLED by the success of financial entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, companies as wide-ranging as advertising agencies, truck makers, package couriers and independent film marketers are racing to set up venture capital arms.</p>
        <p>The prize is not merely the investment gains that are sought by traditional financiers. These companies are seeking primarily to finance  start-ups that are working on innovative technologies that could make or break the corporate parents' own futures.</p>
        <p>The trend is not entirely new. Some Fortune 500 behemoths established venture arms in the 1970's and 1980's, while giants of the new economy, like Intel and Lucent Technologies, have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into their own venture capital units. Banks like Chase Manhattan have also become aggressive venture investors.</p>
        <p>But companies in many other industries are also getting into the act. Consider Artisan Entertainment, an  entertainment producer and distributor in New York, whose marketing on the Internet helped to turn the low-budget ''Blair Witch Project'' into a hit movie last year.</p>
        <p>Last month, Artisan set up a $50 million venture capital fund, called iArtisan, to invest in start-ups working on new-media plumbing like  streaming video and digital compression.</p>
        <p>''This allows us to grow and expand our business,'' said Nicolas van Dyk, a former Disney executive who runs the fund, which has yet to make its first investment. Like a growing number of traditional venture capital shops, Artisan Entertainment may even offer various kinds of nonmonetary help, like office space, phones and advice.</p>
        <p>David Barry, senior editor of The Corporate Venturing Report, counts some 350 corporate venture capital programs around the world. Corporate venture programs accounted for  $8.2 billion, or 15 percent, of the $54 billion invested by the venture capital industry in the first half of this year, according to the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group in Arlington, Va. That is more than twice the level of two years ago.</p>
        <p>''Corporations need a venture capital arm to stay on top of companies that may either be their future partner or eat their lunch,'' Mr. Barry said.</p>
        <p>That is the motivation behind the $50 million that United Parcel Service has staked its Strategic Enterprise Fund. Its main goal ''is to be hand-in-glove with companies with cutting-edge technologies coming down the pike that might have an application for us,'' said Bob Godlewski, a company spokesman.</p>
        <p>''It's a nice accident if we make money,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The fund, started in 1997, recently took a small stake in Air2Web, which produced technology that U.P.S. uses to let customers track shipments online.</p>
        <p>Other recent corporate venture investors include Paccar, a truck maker in Seattle, which is pursuing technologies that may improve its operations, and the WPP Group, the advertising holding company, which is financing new-media start-ups.</p>
        <p>Because corporations are beholden to shareholders and securities overseers, they cannot place as many highflying bets as venture capital shops, which are largely unregulated. And the venture capital firms can compensate their financiers far better than can their corporate counterparts, whose shareholders may resent huge payouts.</p>
        <p>Some corporations are investing expertise, not cash, in the venture funds. Artisan Entertainment raised money from Grove Street Advisors, an investment advisory and venture capital firm, and Audax Ventures, a private equity and venture shop, that went into the iArtisan fund. For its part, Artisan is contributing services to the companies in which the fund will invest.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant, said last month that it would pour $1 billion into a venture fund it had created to bankroll new-media technology companies.</p>
