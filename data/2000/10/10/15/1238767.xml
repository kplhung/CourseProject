        <p>Jo L. has never worked for money a single day of her life. She is 68 and lives alone in a lovely apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side. ''I never think about money, ever,'' she swears. ''I have no idea what things cost.''</p>
        <p>Almost everything in Jo's apartment once belonged to her mother, a legendary New York art collector. But Jo has no use for these valuables -- Picassos, Chagalls, Henry Moores -- and has divided them among her children. What she is interested in is the work of liberal organizations. She invests much of her personal wealth in such groups as EMILY's List, National Coalition Against Censorship and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Her personal expenses are limited to food, books and replacing the occasional worn-out item in her home. ''You need shoes,'' she says. ''I bought a pair of sandals for summer. And I've decided to buy a doormat.'' She guesses the shoes cost somewhere around $50, but adds: ''I don't really know what these things cost. I just give them my credit card and they ring it up.'' The one expenditure she is aware of is the $85 per session, three times a week, that she spends on her personal exercise physiologist.</p>

        <p>Jo L. has never worked for money a single day of her life. She is 68 and lives alone in a lovely apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side. ''I never think about money, ever,'' she swears. ''I have no idea what things cost.''</p>
        <p>Almost everything in Jo's apartment once belonged to her mother, a legendary New York art collector. But Jo has no use for these valuables -- Picassos, Chagalls, Henry Moores -- and has divided them among her children. What she is interested in is the work of liberal organizations. She invests much of her personal wealth in such groups as EMILY's List, National Coalition Against Censorship and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Her personal expenses are limited to food, books and replacing the occasional worn-out item in her home. ''You need shoes,'' she says. ''I bought a pair of sandals for summer. And I've decided to buy a doormat.'' She guesses the shoes cost somewhere around $50, but adds: ''I don't really know what these things cost. I just give them my credit card and they ring it up.'' The one expenditure she is aware of is the $85 per session, three times a week, that she spends on her personal exercise physiologist.</p>
        <p>When she does buy products, Jo contemplates the integrity of the producer; each one, she says, has a hidden consequence. She won't buy Kraft or Nabisco because ''they're in the cigarette business,'' or General Electric products because G.E. manufactures weapons. She tries not to buy anything at chain stores or anything made in China. ''Slave labor,'' she says, ''9 times out of 10.''</p>
        <p>This summer, Jo made her boldest political statement to date. Sprawling over three-quarters of her balcony is a $17,000 customized solar panel system (the cost was confirmed by a local company called Alternative Power, which worked with Jo to get the system installed) that produces half of the electricity she uses in her home. Jo is the pioneer of low-impact living in Manhattan, the first resident to connect a photovoltaic energy system to the city's electricity grid. Between planning and negotiating with her co-op board, it took Jo two years to get the system installed.</p>
        <p>''The solar screens are an absolute expression of what I believe in,'' she beams. ''I am sure it was expensive. I don't know.'' In fact, Jo doesn't even know if the solar panels work, since she can't read the meter. (An examination of her electric bills showed she's paying about $23 per month since the system was installed, compared with the $50 per month she paid last summer.) While she is the first to admit that her efforts are ''minuscule and ineffective,'' Jo says that practical outcomes are not really the point. ''I just do what matters to me,'' she says. Next she's considering what Alternative Power might do with her car. ''Cut out the roof,'' she says, ''and put some panels in, maybe.''</p>
