        <p>OVER the warm remains of the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, the cries from abroad for extradition and repentance are growing stronger. The Serbs are getting credit for finally having dumped the man who ran the country for 13 years, through the wars of secession and the crimes that filled those wars, but the praise is leavened with doubts and questions.</p>
        <p>Will Mr. Milosevic ever be extradited to The Hague, to face war crimes charges over Kosovo and finally, perhaps, over Bosnia? Or is a domestic trial enough?</p>
        <p>There are other indictees at issue, as well, but the more important question raised by the outside world is this: Will the Serbs as a nation face their responsibility (collective guilt is what many mean but don't like to say) for the various crimes committed by their forces or in their name in Bosnia and Kosovo?</p>
        <p>What is not well understood outside Serbia is that a basis for self-examination already exists in what is called civil society -- among journalists, academics, cultural and political figures who have been asking these questions in public since long before Mr. Milosevic was voted and then forced out of power.</p>
        <p>But those questions have not penetrated very deeply into Serbian society, which the world kept isolated through sanctions and travel bans. Many ordinary people accepted the essence of state propaganda, which concentrated, when the topic of victims was raised at all, on Serb victims in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, and on Western hypocrisy for ignoring the crimes of others, like  Russians in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>What is different now is not just openness, but the possibility of state involvement and authority -- through a truth commission, state media and the courts -- in ventilating and examining the questions of Serbian guilt and responsibility.</p>
        <p>Yugoslavia's new president, Vojislav Kostunica, has made it abundantly clear that he regards The Hague as an instrument of American policy. He says he will not hand over Mr. Milosevic. But he recognizes the need for justice and national self-examination.</p>
        <p>Western governments, living up to private promises made during  the Milosevic endgame, have been discreet, as has the tribunal itself. They say they understand the need to stabilize democracy here and are not pressing Mr. Kostunica. Then everyone adds -- at least for now.</p>
        <p>But stabilization in this half-finished revolution may take longer than some would like. The key institutions are the Serbian presidency and parliament, not the federal ones, and Mr. Kostunica has fought to get early Serbian elections, now expected in late December.</p>
        <p>''Nobody can talk to the opposition about guilt and the past just now,'' said Ivan Vejvoda, executive director of the Fund for an Open Society here. ''This is a very important issue, but not the most important issue. The Serbian elections are the real ones, and we mustn't muddle political opinion.''</p>
        <p>The question of guilt became prominent at the end of the bombing war over Kosovo last summer, which restarted the intermittent debate over whether Serbia needed to be ''de-Nazified,'' a form of delousing last undergone, and not very efficiently, in Germany and Japan, which were occupied and run by Allied forces.</p>
        <p>LEFT out of the argument are the facts that Mr. Milosevic was defeated not by outsiders but by his own people, and that Serbia has not been occupied. Left out, too, is that many Serbs know a great deal about these crimes, and that Serbian civic organizations and independent media, many with Western funding, have explored the issues for years.</p>
        <p>There have been seminars, books, films and study projects, some of them organized by Mr. Vejvoda's foundation, a branch of George Soros's Open Society Institute. Others have been produced by the Association of Independent Electronic Media and the Center for Cultural Decontamination. Some have been shown on independent television.</p>
        <p>This spring, Mr. Vejvoda's foundation and the media association sponsored two seminars looking at South Africa and Latin America, but they were not well advertised or attended. There have been international meetings with people from Israel and Germany; Karl Jasper and Hannah Arendt have been translated into Serbian, along with others who have written about social responsibility.</p>
        <p>A fat book called ''The Serbian Side of the War'' was published by the Central European University Press (another Soros project), with articles by Serbs on questions of genocide and nationalism in the former Yugoslavia, looking at the roles of all parties -- politicians, soccer hooligans, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the media.</p>
        <p>These efforts, of course, were not  covered by the state media. Nor are they a state-authorized examination of the past, as in South Africa. But all that seems to be coming.</p>
        <p>Before the election, Mr. Kostunica told The New York Times that he would favor a state-sponsored ''truth commission'' of historians and experts to examine the crimes and victims of all parties to the Yugoslav wars. Just one day after the uprising a week ago that forced Mr. Milosevic to resign, the television station Studio B started showing a documentary made for Montenegrin state television about Bosnia and Kosovo. The film, though choppy, shows real history and real atrocities.</p>
        <p>Jugoslav Pantelic of Studio B says the reaction has been enormous, but divided. The topic is raw for many people. Those unhappy, he said, ''say there's too much about Milosevic and what he's done to us.''</p>
        <p>THAT, of course, is part of the problem. Mr. Milosevic did a lot to the Serbs, for which he is likely to stand trial here. Some political leaders who supported Mr. Kostunica think Mr. Milosevic should be taken out of political circulation soon, first on charges of election manipulation  and then tax abuse, official murder and so on.</p>
        <p>But the Serbs elected him in not-always fraudulent voting and supported his policies for many years -- though a majority of the population, according to polls, turned against him even before the Kosovo war last year. And given a chance to vote against him now, even in unfair circumstances, Serbs gave an outright victory to Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vejvoda says that the issues of guilt and responsibility matter, but they take time and have been handled differently, and not always successfully, in Germany, Austria, Japan, Chile, South Africa, Cambodia, Rwanda and other places. Chile under Augusto Pinochet seems to many a better model for Serbia than Nazi Germany, given the mixture here of authoritarianism and democracy, where state propaganda existed side-by-side with an overmatched but independent media.</p>
        <p>Zarko Korac, an opposition political leader, was one who spoke out against ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. ''There were people, certainly a minority, who spoke against what happened,'' he said. ''And of course, many were uninformed, or chose to be, which is also a moral position. It's a complicated relationship between not being informed and being responsible.''</p>
        <p>But with state media changed, he said, it is important to let Serbs see the facts as the world sees them. ''Leaders and influential people should initiate a wider debate,'' he said. ''But finally, each individual must answer these questions: what did I do in those days, and how much responsibility do I bear?''</p>
