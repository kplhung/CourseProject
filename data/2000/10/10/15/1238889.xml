        <p>IT'S no news that Doug Hughes is  a classy, attention-getting artistic director. And there is no rest for the classy and the attention getting. Not when such adjectives as bold and innovative, so often tossed off about the Doug Hughes style, dare you to keep on daring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes wasted no time creating his own good name and winning a new image for a drifting theater when he took over the artistic leadership of the Long Wharf in New Haven in 1997. For his fourth season's opener, he could hardly have come up with something newer than a 350-year-old play by Moliere that is hardly known in this country. And for what is truly an American premiere, the estimable Moliere maven, Richard Wilbur, has done the first verse translation of the play ''lEtourdi,'' which means scatterbrain and called it ''The Bungler.''</p>

        <p>IT'S no news that Doug Hughes is  a classy, attention-getting artistic director. And there is no rest for the classy and the attention getting. Not when such adjectives as bold and innovative, so often tossed off about the Doug Hughes style, dare you to keep on daring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes wasted no time creating his own good name and winning a new image for a drifting theater when he took over the artistic leadership of the Long Wharf in New Haven in 1997. For his fourth season's opener, he could hardly have come up with something newer than a 350-year-old play by Moliere that is hardly known in this country. And for what is truly an American premiere, the estimable Moliere maven, Richard Wilbur, has done the first verse translation of the play ''lEtourdi,'' which means scatterbrain and called it ''The Bungler.''</p>
        <p>But theatergoers, be forewarned: most of the excitement of this ''Bungler'' was the anticipation of it. Don't  expect the comedy of manners, the depth of social criticism, the complexity of character or the crafty construction of ''The Misanthrope'' or ''School for Wives'' (or ''School for Husbands'' ) or whatever Moliere you may have grown accustomed to.</p>
        <p>''The Bungler'' is weightless. It is all for fun. It is very long. And it does not turn out to be all that much fun in the very long run.</p>
        <p>Moliere's set-up is classically derived from the commedia dell'arte, and takes place in Sicily. He was playing with an old established Italian genre and then moved on to his own invention and immortality. But ''The Bungler,'' discovery that it is, is no more than an experiment with a style that Moliere quickly abandoned, for good and for good reason.</p>
        <p>Mascarille, a role originated by Moliere, is a valet who is really master of the play as well as master of the con, or the stratagem, as it was called in 1655. In one of the translator's more artful phrases, the immodest Mascarille admits: ''The Lord endowed me with rascality.''</p>
        <p>And there are synonyms aplenty for Mascarille's nominal master, Lelie. Try bungler for starters. Or blunderhead, dolt, dunce -- not just a fool but ''the rashest fool on earth.'' That's his own valet's description.</p>
        <p>But Lelie is modest. He calls Mascarille ''a king among valets'' and he is love smitten. The play consists of Mascarille's devices, one after another after another, to snare Celie for his master and away from Lelie's  rival, Leandre. Every calculated intrigue, Lelie, well, bungles. Until he doesn't. And then all finally ends well, as Mascarille charmingly says, ''like the ending of a comedy.''</p>
        <p>''The Bungler'' has its ephemeral charms -- in felicitous turns of phrase, and under Mr. Hughes's forever stylish direction, in lovely stage accouterments, especially Linda Fisher's costumes.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Wilbur's words, all too often coy and mannered, attend to rhyme more than to reason. As if sensing ''The Bungler'' needs help, Mr. Hughes turns it into a showy farce. Call his direction borderline over-the-top, his own stratagem but classy.</p>
        <p>The production is blessed by Jeff Weiss as Mascarille, who emerges as the master executor of a tour-de-force. While it is commonplace to hear audiences exit praising actors' abilities to put a multitude of lines to memory, one often wants to respond: That's their job. What about their performances? But not this time. Everyone within earshot was in awe of Mr. Weiss's bravura display, and all one wanted to do was speak up and agree.</p>
        <p>No, ''The Bungler'' is not a one-man show; the cast of 11 is accomplished, especially 3 delightful strolling musicians and Frank Raiter, as Trufaldin, identified only as an old man.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Weiss makes of Mascarille's marathon monologues truly dazzling feats of endurance, resourcefulness and a performer's wit.  This may be no surprise to admirers of the veteran actor's considerable range, but a remarkable artist unfailingly lifts new surprises from his never-out-of-reach gift bag.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss takes as much relish in the play as workout as in its challenge to create character. For, unfunnily, ''The Bungler'' is too stuffed with caricature, and Mr. Weiss seizes all that excess and transforms it into humanity.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Hughes's part, he has proven, in yet another different, distinctive way that you can be a winner without winning them all.</p>
        <p>''The Bungler,'' Long Wharf Theater, 222 Sargent Drive, New Haven. Performances through Oct. 22. Box office: (203) 787-4282.</p>
