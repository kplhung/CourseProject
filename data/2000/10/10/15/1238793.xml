        <p>MIDNIGHT SUN</p>
        <p>By Elwood Reid.</p>
        <p>Doubleday, $23.95.</p>
        <p>As a more or less explicit homage to Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness,'' Elwood Reid's second novel can be broken down as follows: the Marlow role falls to the book's narrator, Jack, a carpenter with a vague ambition ''to be blindsided and led down some dark extraordinary alley, where I might carve out a life''; the part of Kurtz goes to Nunn, a dark-souled, Harvard-educated guru who presides over a commune of drifter disciples; and Conrad's literal dark heart, the Congo, is here replaced by the remote, bear-filled wilderness of Alaska. The plot, too, somewhat resembles Conrad's: Jack teams up with a burly, gun-toting construction pal named Burke and agrees to bring back one of Nunn's disciples, a young woman, to her father. After making their way upriver, and into ''a tangled buggy mess chock-full of a million ways to die,'' they find both the girl and Nunn -- and, of course, the horror. But that is where the similarities end. While Conrad's spooky genius lay in tying Kurtz to Marlow, and vice versa, and thus probing that delicate line separating good from evil and the tamed from the untamed, Reid's Nunn is as off the grid as his compound's location; he's a bland megalomaniac whose attraction to his followers is never made clear or credible. What's more, the novel ultimately spins off into the kind of guns-and-guts sequences that may remind you of straight-to-video action movies. This is unfortunate, because Reid's two previous books -- If I Don't Six,'' a novel, and ''What Salmon Know,'' a collection of stories -- displayed a refreshingly big-shouldered prose style and a Carveresque sensibility. These qualities are only occasionally visible here, most notably in the novel's early chapters. But they can't compete with the thunder of growling bears and gunfire.</p>
