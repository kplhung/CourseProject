        <p>Hanya Yanagihara, 26, who recently spent in the mid $200,000s for a one-bedroom, 500-square-foot apartment in New York City's West Village, describes her money worries (M)</p>

        <p>Last spring, Hanya Yanagihara, 26, was told that her lease was expiring. She had less than a year to find something new, and she decided to buy. ''First I saw the $80,000 studios, of which there were a lot, disappear. Then I saw the $100,000 studios disappear. By January, I knew that if I didn't do something, I would get priced out.''</p>
        <p>It was the season of epic bidding wars. Hanya went to open houses, crummy apartments where buyers lined up 30 deep, yelling offers on the spot. In April, she offered the full asking price on a place, and the broker didn't even return her call. Friends were no consolation. One sold a one-bedroom for $150,000 over the asking price -- a windfall that only made the market seem more cruel. ''Each success story you hear, instead of buoying you, makes you more depressed,'' Hanya said. ''You spend most of your time hating your friends who are homeowners, home buyers or happily in rentals.''</p>

        <p>Last spring, Hanya Yanagihara, 26, was told that her lease was expiring. She had less than a year to find something new, and she decided to buy. ''First I saw the $80,000 studios, of which there were a lot, disappear. Then I saw the $100,000 studios disappear. By January, I knew that if I didn't do something, I would get priced out.''</p>
        <p>It was the season of epic bidding wars. Hanya went to open houses, crummy apartments where buyers lined up 30 deep, yelling offers on the spot. In April, she offered the full asking price on a place, and the broker didn't even return her call. Friends were no consolation. One sold a one-bedroom for $150,000 over the asking price -- a windfall that only made the market seem more cruel. ''Each success story you hear, instead of buoying you, makes you more depressed,'' Hanya said. ''You spend most of your time hating your friends who are homeowners, home buyers or happily in rentals.''</p>
        <p>Finally in May she found a small one-bedroom in the West Village: 500 square feet; mid-$200,000s; no character, but clean. She resigned herself to overpaying, as long as everyone else was. So on Aug. 4, in the office of the seller's attorney, Hanya emptied the savings account she had started in fourth grade and, with help from her parents, began writing checks: $20,000 to complete her down payment; $390.19 to the New York City Department of Finance; $739.43 to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance; $300 to the seller's attorney; $1,650 to her lawyer; $757.12 for the first month's maintenance. ''It's really depressing just watching money take flight,'' she said. ''And the longer the closing process goes on, the more time you have to think. And the more time you have to think, the more time you have to panic.''</p>
        <p>Now she goes to bed fearing that the market has stalled, that the value is leaking from her apartment with each passing day. She scans the ads almost as obsessively as before. As a mantra, she tells herself that the West Village will always be in demand, that if the market goes down, she can ride it out. Besides, she said: ''There was no other option. If I hadn't bought something and the market continued to go up, I'd be living in a storage unit or something.'' She says she doesn't dream about real estate, ''but I think about it all of the time, which is worse, in a way.''</p>
        <p>To pay for her new place, Yanagihara has had to make some adjustments. ''I'm trying to only eat out if friends are paying for it,'' she said. She used to treat herself to one nice dinner a week, for about $20. Now she goes to Chinatown, where she can dine for $4. To cut lunch expenses she might start buying sandwiches after 5 o'clock, when they're half-price. ''Every day,'' she said, ''I feel guilty buying lunch, books, anything.'' She scrapped a trip to Japan, which would have cost about $2,300. To trim another $900, she refused to buy new fall clothes. She also started doing her own laundry, for the first time in years, to save about $6 a week. ''I don't know whether it's worthwhile,'' she said, ''the savings are so small.'' In a recent setback, she damaged some clothes washing them by hand, in an effort to cut $7 a week in dry cleaning expenses.</p>
        <p>Even as she pinches pennies, she does not always save them. The windfall from the scrapped vacation is already spent toward custom bookcases, which cost about $2,500. Then there's the $11,000 Florence Knoll credenza she covets. And a rug. And pots and pans. When she talks of these things, and of the size of the mortgage for her 500 square feet, a flicker of despair crosses her face. Then she composes herself. ''It's the gestures one makes toward saving money that count in the end,'' she says.</p>
