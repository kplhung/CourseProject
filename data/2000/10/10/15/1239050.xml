        <p>LAST fall, the stocks of small companies were taking off. By the end of the year, the Russell 2000 index was up 19.6 percent, outdueling the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index for the first time since 1993.</p>
        <p>This year started with another 20 percent rally. But then small-capitalization stocks were tripped up by the spring sell-off, and the Russell and its 2,000 stocks have floundered ever since. A nice rally in August, with the index rebounding 7.4 percent, died in September, and the fall is continuing this month. Since the end of August, the Russell has dropped 10.7 percent.</p>
        <p>The Russell sell-off shouldn't be a surprise. The entire stock market is having a lot of trouble as investors appear to be realizing -- finally -- that slower economic growth will cut into the terrific, 20 percent earnings gains that they have come to take for granted. It was the reluctance to wake up to a changing earnings environment that made this sell-off so sharp. Even with the Friday rally, the Dow Jones industrial average is still down 9.1 percent and the Nasdaq 21.1 percent since August.</p>
        <p>It took a long string of earnings warnings, including those last week from Lucent, Home Depot, Motorola and Yahoo, to get the message through.</p>
        <p>But there may be a tiny but bright light in all this for the stocks of small companies, which Merrill Lynch defines as those with market capitalizations of less than $1.6 billion.</p>
        <p>For one, small caps are holding up rather well. While the Russell is down 4.8 percent for the year, the Dow is off 11.4 percent. The Nasdaq, which has been weighted down by its technology stocks, has plunged 18.5 percent this year, even after Friday's 7.9 percent surge, its second-best day ever.</p>
        <p>Such relatively good performance is not always the case. Often, when the three marquee indexes plunge, small-cap stocks plunge further. In late summer of 1998, the Russian bond default and ruble devaluation, combined with the bailout of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, sent both the Dow and the S.&amp; P. 500 down 19.3 percent and the Nasdaq down 29.5 percent. But the Russell outdid them all, falling 32.9 percent. While the Russell finished the year down, the others finished sharply higher.</p>
        <p>Satya Pradhuman, director of small-cap research at Merrill Lynch, said several factors should enable small-cap stocks to continue to hold their own in the market.</p>
        <p>One is the very low price-to-earnings ratios of these stocks. About 24 percent of the stocks in the Merrill Lynch small-cap index have ratios of less than 10, using 12-month trailing earnings. This signals that there are many underpriced small-cap issues, Mr. Pradhuman said, and that many investors seem to be expecting the worst right now --  a recession.</p>
        <p>But if the economy achieves a less painful soft landing, these stocks will be even better bargains.</p>
        <p>''If the economy holds up O.K., so will small-cap stocks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pradhuman also finds optimism in small-cap mergers, which further prove that there are bargains out there and that someone recognizes them. There were 34 merger announcements among small-cap companies in the second quarter -- a historically strong number even if down slightly from the first quarter.</p>
        <p>But this is a market for stock pickers, he warns. Small-cap stocks in the financial, health care and energy sectors escaped the swoon in September. Financial issues rose 4.2 percent, health care stocks 3.9 percent and energy shares 2.6 percent. Small-cap technology stocks plunged 11.9 percent, and transportation issues fell 8.9 percent.</p>
        <p>No matter what happens, more investors than usual are betting on small-cap stocks. Small-cap growth funds took an average of 13.7 percent of the net flows into equity mutual funds in the four quarters ended in September. That share was one of the largest since 1992, according to AMG Data Services, which compiles mutual fund data.</p>
        <p>That performance was outdone only by the small-cap growth flows in the last quarter of 1997 and the first two of 1998. But that surge of investor enthusiasm was broken in the summer of 1998. And unless investors today learn to live with slower -- but positive -- earnings growth and believe in a soft landing for the economy, the enthusiasm could be quashed again.</p>
