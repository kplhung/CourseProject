        <p>A team of F.B.I. agents, Navy investigators and other antiterrorist experts arrived in this port city on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula today to hasten the inquiry into the explosion that hobbled the destroyer Cole, killing 17 American sailors and wounding more than 30 others, at least five of them critically.</p>
        <p>Federal investigators looking into what Washington has tentatively called a terrorist act said today that an analysis had indicated that the attackers used at least 440 pounds of high explosives, and that the hole caused by the blast at the Cole's waterline was about 80 feet wide and perhaps half as deep, far larger than initial reports suggested.</p>

        <p>A team of F.B.I. agents, Navy investigators and other antiterrorist experts arrived in this port city on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula today to hasten the inquiry into the explosion that hobbled the destroyer Cole, killing 17 American sailors and wounding more than 30 others, at least five of them critically.</p>
        <p>Federal investigators looking into what Washington has tentatively called a terrorist act said today that an analysis had indicated that the attackers used at least 440 pounds of high explosives, and that the hole caused by the blast at the Cole's waterline was about 80 feet wide and perhaps half as deep, far larger than initial reports suggested.</p>
        <p>The investigation into the attack on one of the Navy's most sophisticated warships was bolstered with the arrival of a 40-member squad from the federal emergency support team, a Washington-based unit that draws experts from different government agencies. They joined a score of other investigators who flew in earlier from bases in Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East, including the headquarters of the Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf. Over the weekend, the team is expected to grow to more than 100, including personnel from the Central Intelligence Agency and defense intelligence agencies.</p>
        <p>The investigation is focusing on the theory that a team of suicide bombers, possibly belonging to an Islamic terrorist group, attacked the destroyer using the cover of a mooring operation in Aden harbor to dash in among a flotilla of support vessels.</p>
        <p>Witnesses have described two men in a motorized rubber dinghy racing to the port side of the Navy ship and standing erect at the moment that the blast occurred.</p>
        <p>If confirmed as the work of terrorists, the attack would be one of the most deadly incidents in years, and the worst against Americans in the Middle East since a truck-bombing of a military barracks in Saudi Arabia killed 19 American servicemen and wounded hundreds in June 1996.</p>
        <p>In the first account by a witness of the scene aboard the Cole, a senior American diplomat who visited the ship on Friday tonight described the situation 24 hours after the blast as ''horrific,'' with surviving sailors struggling with shock at the loss of their crewmates and trying to keep the ship afloat despite widespread flooding below decks and severe structural damage throughout the ship, even on the upper decks well above the site of the blast.</p>
        <p>Although investigators continued today to say they have no firm leads on the identity or motive of the attackers, the American official told reporters that the Yemeni authorities had detained an unknown number of people in Aden for questioning, apparently including dock workers and some of the crewmen aboard other small vessels that were helping to service the Cole at the time of the blast.</p>
        <p>The official described seeing steel doors and hatches buckled off their hinges, and parts of the ship's superstructure twisted by the force of the explosion. ''The damage seemed to extend throughout the ship,'' the official said at an onshore briefing that was held on condition that the official not be identified. The official said crewmen, while showing signs of grieving over lost shipmates, were working round the clock.</p>
        <p>''They're very focused on saving the ship, but in their faces you can see that they just lost 17 of their friends, and there are elements of shell shock as well,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>The official added: ''These are professionals. They are observing a personal loss, but their first responsibility is toward the ship.''</p>
        <p>An interfaith memorial service for the dead sailors will be held aboard the ship on Sunday morning, attended by all crew members not assigned to emergency duties.</p>
        <p>The official offered no new details of the explosion, other than saying that the small vessel believed to have set off the blast was ''some sort of Yemeni boat that approached the ship when it as already at anchor'' and that ''it was not suspicious to the point where anybody took any notice of it.''</p>
        <p>Navy officials have said the ship  and crew were at the second highest degree of alert observed in the Fifth Fleet, stationed in Persian Gulf, with crew members assigned to watch boats approaching the Cole through binoculars and others with weapons keeping watch.</p>
        <p>The official, who was among those responsible for monitoring the safety of the refueling stops made by United States warships here since the stopovers were approved in late 1998, said the explosion that killed the sailors ''may not necessarily have been a lapse in security.'' The official added, ''Unfortunately, you sometimes learn lessons in the most tragic ways, and there will definitely be lessons learned from this.''</p>
        <p>Although the official did not elaborate, the suggestion that there had been no breach of security appeared to indicate that investigators believe that the attackers may have infiltrated the onshore Yemeni organizations responsible for assisting in refueling and re-supplying the ship. One account circulating here has been that the Cole's crew believed the rubber dinghy that apparently carried the explosives to be one of the boats assigned to the help the United States ship moor, refuel and remove garbage and other waste.</p>
        <p>As the destroyer sat listing in Aden's inner harbor today, under blazing 100-degree heat, the Pentagon announced new measures suggesting that it remained concerned about conditions aboard the ship, and possibly about further terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>The announcement said the Fifth Fleet had ordered two other ships, the frigate Hawes and the destroyer Donald Cook, to join the Cole in Aden as soon as possible ''so the crews of the new ships can help do some of the work that's required to keep the ship afloat and to deal with the damage to the hull,'' said Kenneth H. Bacon, a Pentagon spokesmen.</p>
        <p>The reinforcements were approaching Aden at midafternoon, close enough for helicopters to begin shuttling Navy officials out to the incoming ships, and they were expected to be in the port by nightfall.</p>
        <p>Throughout the night and into the day Yemeni patrol boats could be seen in the harbor, and a British frigate, the Marlborough, remained moored alongside the Cole in what British and American officials said was a move by the Royal Navy to assist the American destroyer and the surviving members of its 293-member crew.</p>
        <p>Reporters' requests to visit the Cole continued to be deferred. The Navy said it wanted no distractions from the investigation, which included diving operations below the Cole's waterline and down to the harbor floor to determine the extent of the damage to the ship and to search for the remains, if any, of the 10 sailors  listed as dead but still missing.</p>
        <p>The bodies of five of the seven crew members who were found after the blast were flown aboard a military plane to Dover, Del., after being transferred first from Aden to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. And this morning 39 wounded shipmates from the Cole arrived at the United States Army Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany. About half were carried on stretchers.</p>
        <p>During the day, the Navy announced that in addition to the 33 crew members originally listed as wounded, six of those evacuated on Friday to Landstuhl were suffering from what Lt. Terrence Dudley, a Navy spokesman, described as ''post-traumatic stress.''</p>
        <p>For crew members remaining aboard the Cole, conditions appeared to be highly uncomfortable. Many were sleeping under awnings stretched across the upper decks after the blast filled many of the vessel's compartments and its engine room with water, rendering the ship's engines unusable and stripping the vessel of air-conditioning. Large shipments of bottled water flown from Bahrain, as well as emergency food supplies, were being shuttled out to the ship by tenders.</p>
        <p>There seemed little doubt that the billion-dollar warship was severely damaged. Lieutenant Dudley said that much of the recovery crew's effort had gone into pumping water out of flooded compartments, and to investigating ways of patching the hole caused by the blast, part of which was below the waterline.</p>
        <p>That would enable sailors to get the ship to dockside, in Aden or elsewhere, where more extensive repairs could be made that would allow the Cole to be towed back to its home port of Norfolk, Va.</p>
        <p>Officials in Washington said on Friday that they had no firm leads on which group might have carried out the attack. American officials in Aden stressed the thoroughness of the investigation here. The team that arrived overnight from Washington will remain in Aden ''as long as it takes,'' Lieutenant Dudley said.</p>
        <p>Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a former army general who runs this nation of almost 18 million people largely as a personal fief, has continued to imply that the American version of the explosion is wrong, and that it resulted from an accident aboard the Cole, not terrorism.</p>
        <p>Yemen's official news agency, SABA, reporting today on a telephone conversation on Friday night between Mr. Saleh and President Clinton, quoted Mr. Saleh as telling Mr. Clinton that both countries must avoid ''a wrong analysis'' of the cause. Although SABA did not say what Mr. Saleh meant, he has maintained since the explosion that it was ''not a deliberate act,'' and that reports reaching him from his security agencies have indicated that the blast occurred inside the Cole.</p>
        <p>Navy spokesmen here have disputed that version. They say all their evidence shows that the blast, which they say occurred at 9:30 a.m. local time on Thursday (2:30 a.m. Eastern time), happened when the unidentified rubber boat maneuvered between other support vessels assisting the Cole with mooring, refueling and garbage removal operations, and raced to the Cole's port side.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Saleh's suggestion that the blast was an accident, he has been at pains to promise that Yemen will cooperate with the investigation and ''hunt down'' the perpetrators if terrorist involvement is proved.  American officials here say he has abided by that promise, offering all the help requested, and waiving Yemeni laws and regulations to allow large numbers of American military and intelligence officials to operate with few restrictions.</p>
        <p>The cooperation has extended to allowing a 40-man Marine antiterrorist squad deployed from Bahrain to patrol inside a government-owned harborside hotel where most of the American team members are staying, wearing desert-style camouflage uniforms and carrying automatic rifles. The marines also act as bodyguards for investigators shuttling to the harborside.</p>
        <p>President Saleh has issued statements harshly condemning Israel for its attacks on Palestinians in the last two weeks and directed government officials to help organize public demonstrations that have featured denunciations of Jews and Americans, including one in Aden on Tuesday that drew 50,000 people.</p>
        <p>THE WARSHIP EXPLOSION: THE OVERVIEW  Correction:  October 18, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Sunday about the investigation into the explosion that killed 17 American sailors on the destroyer Cole last week misstated the size of the hole in the ship.
