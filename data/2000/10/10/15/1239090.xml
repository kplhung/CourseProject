        <p>After earnings reports, rising oil prices and violence in the Middle East scared them away for most of the week, buyers came out in droves on Friday the 13th and pulled the major stock market averages out of the depths of just a day earlier. Trading volume was huge.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index, which had suffered the biggest swoon, came back strongest on Friday, posting its second-best one-day percentage gain. But even with that rally, the technology-heavy index was down 1.3 percent for the week, closing at 3,316.77. For the year, the Nasdaq is now down 18.5 percent.</p>

        <p>After earnings reports, rising oil prices and violence in the Middle East scared them away for most of the week, buyers came out in droves on Friday the 13th and pulled the major stock market averages out of the depths of just a day earlier. Trading volume was huge.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index, which had suffered the biggest swoon, came back strongest on Friday, posting its second-best one-day percentage gain. But even with that rally, the technology-heavy index was down 1.3 percent for the week, closing at 3,316.77. For the year, the Nasdaq is now down 18.5 percent.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index, meanwhile, despite a 3.3 percent gain on Friday, still lost 2.5 percent of its value for the week, closing at 1,374.17. The S.&amp;P. 500 has fallen 6.5 percent since the start of the year.</p>
        <p>But the Dow Jones industrial average was the most jinxed. Thanks to the first earnings warning in more than five years from Home Depot, a Dow component, the index took a pasting on Thursday. It rose 1.6 percent on Friday, but was down 3.8 percent for the week, closing at 10,192.18. The blue-chip index has slipped 11.4 percent so far this year.</p>
