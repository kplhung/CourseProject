        <p>The mayor of Red Bank found himself in an embarrassing situation last week following a weekend fender bender that ended with his being charged with leaving the scene of an accident and seeing his car impounded by the State Police.</p>
        <p>Mayor Edward J. McKenna, who is a lawyer, said he planned to plead not guilty in Middletown Municipal Court, adding that ''a very minor accident'' had been blown out of proportion.</p>
        <p>He did acknowledge, in a prepared statement, that he left the scene, but only after giving the other driver his name and address and only after waiting ''a considerable period of time'' for a state trooper at the insistence of the other driver.</p>
        <p>''There was a bump,'' Mr. McKenna said in a telephone interview. ''There was no damage. There were no injuries. I identified myself and where I lived. There was no hit and run whatsoever. This was not a hit and run, period.''</p>
        <p>But the State Police thought so. So a trooper showed up at the door of Mr. McKenna's home shortly after the accident. When Mr. McKenna's wife said he was unavailable, the police impounded his 1999 Mercedes-Benz and issued the mayor three summonses, for leaving the scene of an accident, failure to report an accident and careless driving.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna, 50, has been praised as a major force in the redevelopment of Red Bank into a business, restaurant and entertainment center  during his nine years in office.</p>
        <p>The other driver, Ralph Panzino, 58, of North Arlington in Bergen County, has an unlisted telephone number. An attempt to reach him in person at his last known address was unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>The accident occurred at 7:05 p.m. last Saturday on a ramp to the Garden State Parkway at Interchange 109, according to Sgt. Al Della Fave, a state police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Panzino's 1997 Blazer sport utility vehicle ''for some unknown reason slowed down and McKenna didn't realize it and tapped the back of the Blazer,'' Sergeant Della Fave said.</p>
        <p>Both drivers pulled over and identified themselves, he said. There were no injuries and the damage to both cars was minor, though not specified, Sergeant Della Fave said.  Nonetheless, Mr. Panzino wanted the police to respond and file a report.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes in minor accidents, they exchange information and agree to work it out themselves,'' Sergeant Della Fave said. ''In this case, Mr. Panzino wasn't comfortable with that, and he wanted the police to be there and wanted a report.''</p>
        <p>After waiting ''a short time'' for the police to show up, Mr. McKenna got in his car and left, Sergeant Della Fave said. The sergeant said he did not know how long Mayor McKenna waited or how long it took for the police to respond. When they did arrive, Mr. Panzino gave them ''a full description and plate number.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna declined to go into details beyond his prepared statement, saying the case will end up in municipal court.</p>
        <p>According to the statement, Mr. McKenna called the police Sunday, the day after the accident, and arranged to give a formal statement.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Della Fave said that Mr. McKenna visited the Holmdel station on Tuesday, gave a statement to police, and got his car back.</p>
