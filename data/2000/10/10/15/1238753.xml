        <p>THE GREEN SUIT</p>
        <p>By Dwight Allen.</p>
        <p>274 pp. Chapel Hill, N.C.:</p>
        <p>Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $22.95.</p>
        <p>DWIGHT ALLEN has a lot of nerve. He's written 11 connected short stories featuring one Peter Sackrider, a not-instantly-lovable character by any of the current indexes of quantifiable lovability: he's the son of a Kentucky establishment family (his father is a judge) as well as a trust-fund-inheriting, wife-ditching, Corolla-driving bourgeois dog who is trying to become a writer. Allen further presses his luck by writing four of the stories from the point of view of women in Peter's life -- family retainer, wife, ex-girlfriend, mother -- who are in a position to know all the flaws he does his best to hide when he meets new people.</p>
        <p>Finally, Allen chooses to portray not the major events in Peter's life but far smaller moments that, significant as they may be to his development, mostly fail to be sensational, violent or even exotic. So here's a book about an upper-middle-class white man with no truly nasty habits yet no mountain-climbing bravado or gene-decoding accomplishments, either. He's privileged average. Although he is for the most part observant and thoughtful about the women in his life, he seems well down the list of things that keep them awake at night much past the first rocket launch of attraction. Even his mother seems more interested in his sad sister than in him; pretty rough stuff, yet he doesn't fight back with any real self-assurance.</p>
        <p>Ralph Fiennes is the man to play him. Think smart yet wan. Think romantic mistake. Think: O.K., this guy will probably get it together someday. But even though he's cute and sensitive, is it really worth waiting around for that to happen?</p>
        <p>Though ''The Green Suit'' doesn't offer a final answer to that question, it makes a good case for having faith in Peter. The method by which this typically happens is exemplified by a story called ''Not Renata,'' in which an old girlfriend of Peter's sets the record straight with regard to his fictional version of her. She is not the Renata of his creation -- just as he's not any of the doppelg</p>
        <p>''Succor,'' for example, concerns Larry Hale, an intelligent Lucifer who weasels his way into Peter's life after he rescues him when Larry's car breaks down near Peter's house. Peter is both intrigued and repelled by Larry's divorced, down-and-out existence, and while visiting Larry at the seedy motor court where he lives, Peter observes, among other striking details, a ''black plastic garbage bag stuck in the Cyclone fence . . . the sun shining on it as intensely as on the river.'' At first Peter is suspicious of Larry, then drawn to confide in him; finally he is irrevocably unsettled by him. When Larry shows up uninvited for Easter dinner, Peter tells him to get out, but instead Larry stays and lies ''suspended between trees, the julep mug on his chest, his mouth wet and hungry looking.'' In ''The Hazeletts' Dog,'' Peter is similarly brought up short by his behavioral similarities to the mutt next door. In spite of his background and money, Peter doesn't have it easy. He has to find his soul before the Larrys of the world eat it up.</p>
        <p>READERS will pick their own favorites among these stories, although the less obviously arresting may gain in appeal over time. There are layers of subtle meaning and plotting here; the work not only stands up to rereading but rewards the effort. The final story is called ''Invisible.'' Throughout the book, Peter navigates between being somewhat invisible himself and the lure of the defining green suit worn by a free-spirited neighbor. Again, he's neither this nor that, but just Peter Sackrider, learning to make the most of himself.</p>
