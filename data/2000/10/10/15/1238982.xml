        <p>I AM sitting in the cafeteria of my high school, a Sony Walkman strapped to my head, the music blasting in my ears. But it is the latest Walkman, and I am clearly the hottest thing in braces. Noticing me, a chic upperclassman asks what I'm listening to.</p>
        <p>I'm so cool that I don't even bat an eye. ''The 'Yentl' soundtrack,'' I reply as she nearly chokes on her chop suey.</p>
        <p>''The what?'' she asked. ''I thought you were listening to something cool.''</p>
        <p>I wanted to die.</p>
        <p>I am not sure what happened to  that girl, but I wouldn't be surprised if she became one of those hipper-than-hip trend spotters, a goddess of grooviness whose job is to define cool for the world. These are the people who tell us that Hush Puppies are back, that skateboards are passe and  that metal hooks must protrude from our tongues if we really want to be contenders. And, of course, whether we should be listening to Barbra Streisand in any given decade.</p>
        <p>Call them cool guessers, cool assessors or coolhunters, as does Malcolm Gladwell, author of ''The Tipping Point'' (Little Brown), a book about fads. Marketing and Web companies rely on their insights and observations; their thoughts determine how a clothing company should advertise its brand, for example, or whether a soft drink should associate itself with, say, Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>Robert Johnson, 28, is a trend spotter, or ''chief,'' at Bla-bla.com, a Manhattan business that looks for promising Web sites and helps their creators turn them into full-fledged e-businesses. (Its slogan: ''We turn basement warriors into capitalist pigs.'') Mr. Johnson earns in the mid-$40,000's, and his job, according to the company founder, Hagai Yardeny, also 28, is to ''check out what's cool on the Web.'' Really.</p>
        <p>Resumes and recommendations are not required for becoming a chief. ''They're all just cool people,'' Mr. Yardeny said of his seven-member staff.</p>
        <p>Defining coolness isn't always easy. ''It's nearly as hard as defining love; it's so individual,'' said Mr. Johnson, a former cheese salesman.  ''It takes someone who is engrossed with popular culture to be an effective trend spotter. You need a strong base in what has gone on in the past in terms of fads and trends to understand what the next big thing is going to be.''</p>
        <p>Julien Dobbs-Higginson, 29, agreed. He is an ''urban pioneer,'' another term for a trend spotter, for the L Report, a new online look at sociocultural trends among people aged 14 to 30 (www.lreport.com). To keep its finger on the pulse, the L Report, a division of Lambesis, an advertising agency in Del Mar, Calif., hired freelance trend seekers in six American cities to define cool in entertainment, fashion, music, food and sports. Mr. Dobbs-Higginson earns $50 for every idea he proposes and $1,000 every three months for assembling an in-depth commentary on trends. ''You can't put an ad in the paper saying you're looking for trend spotters,'' he said. ''It's just an instinct.''</p>
        <p>After a certain point, even the coolest person can become a little frozen in time. When that happens, you need to go right to the source -- the young people who establish the trends. Joseph Janus, 31, realized this six years ago as vice president for advertising and marketing at JNCO, a denim manufacturer in Los Angeles. Mr. Janus says that as an adolescent, he  was ''one of those kids who always tried to be supercool and ignore what other people were doing.''</p>
        <p>''As soon as other people caught on, I moved on,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Recognizing that many teenagers still have such attitudes, he decided to let them tell him what was good about JNCO's clothes. He solicited advice on the Web and hired teenage ''ambassadors'' to help out. He paid them with free clothing and professional business cards. During his four-year tenure, he said, the company's sales soared to $300 million from $20 million; he attributed the improvement largely to his ambassadors.</p>
        <p>''I call myself someone who keeps an ear to the ground with youth culture,'' Mr. Janus said. ''And by this I am able to market the brands that I need to attract youth.''</p>
        <p>CAN anyone learn cool, or is it something that one is born with, like green eyes or blond hair?</p>
        <p>''It's a question of being very driven, soaking up a lot of information, traveling, reading,'' Mr. Dobbs-Higginson said. ''It's a weird job, and it's something that's a bit of luck. You need to be observant and have an eye for detail.''</p>
        <p>But there are some rules of thumb. To be truly in touch, stay in tune with the youth market. Go to clubs, hang in the 'hood and cruise college campuses. Immerse yourself in the life of a teenager.</p>
        <p>I suggest taking it a step further and, as Drew Barrymore did in the movie ''Never Been Kissed,'' returning to high school for in-depth field research.</p>
        <p>But beware: If you are a Streisand fan, don't wear a Walkman. I hear that MP3 players are all the rage.</p>
