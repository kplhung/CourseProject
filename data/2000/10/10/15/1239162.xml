        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Money,'' was released on Thursday by the Republican Leadership Council, a national organization of moderate Republicans that supports Representative Bob Franks, the party's candidate for United States Senate from New Jersey. Mr. Franks is a member of the council's advisory board, but he says he did not ask for or authorize the ad. Because the commercial does not explicitly tell viewers to vote for Mr. Franks or against his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine, it is not subject to federal campaign contribution limits. The ad will run on broadcast and cable stations in New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia over the next two weeks, at a cost of $520,000, a very modest media buy.</p>

        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Money,'' was released on Thursday by the Republican Leadership Council, a national organization of moderate Republicans that supports Representative Bob Franks, the party's candidate for United States Senate from New Jersey. Mr. Franks is a member of the council's advisory board, but he says he did not ask for or authorize the ad. Because the commercial does not explicitly tell viewers to vote for Mr. Franks or against his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine, it is not subject to federal campaign contribution limits. The ad will run on broadcast and cable stations in New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia over the next two weeks, at a cost of $520,000, a very modest media buy.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Jamestown Associates</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a small framed image of Mr. Corzine, speaking in extreme slow motion so he is made to look defensive or even haughty, as quotations from newspaper and magazine articles about his campaign spending flash on-screen: ''A Human A.T.M. Machine,'' ''Buying an Election,'' ''Democracy Suffers.'' Subtitles echo the script: ''Millions for welfare'' is shown over a picture of women in line at a government office with a young girl sprawled on a chair in the foreground, and ''millions for Russia'' is shown over a picture of St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.</p>
        <p>Next the screen is filled by the words ''$5,000 a year,'' followed by a picture of not-so-tranquil domesticity: an infant, with pacifier, dozing in the foreground as its mother sits at a kitchen table, surrounded by bills, and suddenly lets her head fall into her hands as if she has just realized that she is going to the poorhouse. The ad ends by urging viewers to ''tell Jon Corzine what $5,000 a year means to you,'' and provides the telephone number of Mr. Corzine's campaign headquarters.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Jon Corzine is spending a lot of his money now. So he can spend a lot of your money later. Corzine wants to spend millions for more welfare, and foreign aid to Russia. The Trentonian says Corzine's schemes 'would come at a tremendous cost to taxpayers.' Congressional budget experts predict Corzine's spending programs would cost the average taxpayer $5,000 a year. Five thousand dollars might not seem like much to Jon Corzine. Tell him what $5,000 would mean to your family budget.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The commentary on Mr. Corzine's campaign spending is familiar and accurate. But the rest of the commercial is substantially misleading. Mr. Corzine does not propose spending ''millions for more welfare,'' although he does want to spend billions on health care for the uninsured, long-term care for the elderly and disabled, education, a prescription drug benefit under Medicare and other programs. He supports continued aid to Russia, as do many leaders in both major parties, but he also favors the World Bank's considering Russia's conduct in Chechnya as a factor in loan decisions. Most important, the $5,000-per-taxpayer figure relied on greatly exaggerated estimates of the costs of Mr. Corzine's proposals, and was prepared by the House Budget Committee, of which Mr. Franks is a member, and whose chairman, Representative John Kasich of Ohio, is his best friend in Congress. While Mr. Corzine's programs will add billions in new spending, he says he will oppose tax increases except on tobacco products or on matters of national security.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Franks has recently spent so much time attacking Mr. Corzine for his campaign spending and limited financial disclosures that one of his earlier arguments seemed to have fallen by the wayside: that Mr. Corzine's ''recklessness'' with his own money would translate into recklessness with taxpayer money as well. With this ad, Mr. Franks's allies in Washington renew that theme. But while Mr. Corzine is running attack ads and more positive commercials extolling his own ambitious proposals,  Mr. Franks is telling voters only why they should not elect Mr. Corzine. He has yet to broadcast a commercial that gives them a reason to elect him.</p>
