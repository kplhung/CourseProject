        <p>I TRIED hard to know the enemy, the better to defeat him.</p>
        <p>The enemy didn't look dangerous. He looked dumpy. He was fat and walked with a waddle. The gleam in his eyes might have been malicious, or it might have been mischievous. Or maybe it was just rapacious.</p>
        <p>I never saw a hungrier critter than a groundhog.</p>
        <p>Fortunate and few are the gardeners who have never had to contend with groundhogs -- or woodchucks, as they are called in some parts of the country. In nearly two decades of rural living, I dealt with dastardly deer and ravenous rabbits, robbing raccoons and corn-cadging crows. If birds weren't bombing the blueberries, turtles were tasting the tomatoes, taking one tentative bite out of each fruit, like some sort of reptilian culinary critic.</p>
        <p>But nothing can wreck a garden like a groundhog. Imagine a squirrel on steroids.</p>
        <p>In fact, groundhogs are the largest member of the squirrel family, Sciuridae, in the order Rodentia. The family is rather well established, having been around since the Miocene Epoch, and groundhogs aren't above flaunting the fact that their bloodline is superior -- or at least older -- than mine.</p>
        <p>Have you ever seen anything haughtier looking than a groundhog sitting up on his haunches, proudly surveying his domain and sneering at your pathetic efforts to thwart him?</p>
        <p>My gardens in Pennsylvania were set in groundhog Eden, amid hayfields, woodlands and ditches, with a scattering of what real estate agents euphemistically call outbuildings. The hay meadows were webbed with groundhog trails -- hundreds of feet of them -- that led to burrows dug into the sides of overgrown ditches or under wobbly sheds.</p>
        <p>By conservative estimate, a dozen groundhogs called my acreage home, and the population swelled seasonally when the young emerged from mama's burrow. If that sounds like a modest number on 65 acres, consider that a full-grown groundhog weighs about 10 pounds and eats the equivalent of his body weight every day.</p>
        <p>That's 10 pounds of lettuce, broccoli, spinach, cabbage, strawberries, tomatoes, squash and melons. Groundhogs eat tree fruit, too -- right out of the tree. I thought I was hallucinating the first time I heard a noise in the apple tree and saw a fat groundhog up there gnawing on the Winesaps.</p>
        <p>My neighbors assured me there was only one sure way to control groundhogs, and that was with a varmint gun -- a .22-caliber rifle. Given my general dislike of firearms, to say nothing of my lousy marksmanship, I opted for nonlethal methods.</p>
        <p>Fencing was a joke. Groundhogs are built to dig, with short, powerful legs and strong claws. They dig so fast and furiously that their ears are designed to fold forward to keep out flying dirt.</p>
        <p>In an effort to wear out one critter who had taken up housekeeping under a tool shed, I filled his burrow daily with several wheelbarrows of rocks and soil. Every morning, the burrow was dug out again, the soil piled to one side and the rocks laid out flat as if he were building a patio.</p>
        <p>After a fortnight, the groundhog wore me out. Score one for Marmota monax, zero for Homo sapiens.</p>
        <p>Repellants were virtually useless. I sprinkled commercial preparations that were guaranteed to taste awful to a groundhog. My groundhogs ate it with relish. I put out saucers of blood meal, which was supposed to send groundhogs skedaddling. The groundhogs were unfazed, although rabbits fled in terror.</p>
        <p>Live traps were marginally more effective. These I baited with apples and set up near the groundhog's burrow. Whether from greed or laziness I couldn't tell, but the groundhogs usually fell for the bait. I released them along a cleared power line that cut across a ridge a few miles away, where there was ample open space and no gardens.</p>
        <p>My neighbors assured me that the groundhogs probably beat me back to the farm.</p>
        <p>Certainly it seemed like the same groundhogs returned every year after granting me three months or so of blissfully groundhog-free existence during their winter hibernation. They were so comfortable on the place that they scarcely paid me any notice, even when I stomped and yelled and threw rocks at them. Of course, my aim with rocks isn't much better than my aim with a rifle.</p>
        <p>Once I put a basket of tomatoes down near the greenhouse and returned in a few minutes to find a groundhog picking through the fruit. As I stood dumbfounded, less than a dozen feet away, he casually rummaged through the basket until he found a large pink fruit of an heirloom variety. He ate it on the spot.</p>
        <p>I have to give him credit for good taste.</p>
        <p>Shortly before I left the farm for a slightly more suburban existence in western New Jersey, I finally stumbled on what appeared to be an effective way to evict a groundhog. I repeatedly emptied the cat box into the groundhog's burrow.</p>
        <p>This method requires a cat (I have four) and some persistence, but eventually the ammonia fumes were too much -- even for a groundhog.</p>
        <p>I may have reason to ply that technique again. My new garden has suburban lawns on both sides, but it backs up to a wooded area. As I surveyed the backyard plantings last week, pondering what to leave and what to take out, I caught a slight movement at the edge of the woods.</p>
        <p>He sat up on his haunches, chewing placidly. I could swear I'd seen that gleam in the eye before.</p>
