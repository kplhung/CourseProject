        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his excellent article on the opera patron Alberto W. Vilar, Allan Kozinn notes that there are those who sneer at such largess as being nothing but attention-getting self-aggrandizement. These critics obviously do not understand the true opera lover, whose devotion to opera and its world is every bit as passionate as the operas themselves. As a Met Opera patron, on a much smaller scale, I do indeed look up to Mr. Vilar's example, with envy. For I would do exactly as he has, if I had the means. These gifts are expressions of love. The fact that they are appreciated only makes it sweeter. And no organization makes its donors feel appreciated more than the Met does. They make us feel like family.</p>
