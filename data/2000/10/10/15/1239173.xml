        <p>The architect of the plan to send United States Navy ships into the port of Aden as part of the larger goal of improving relations with Yemen defended his decision today, saying he was trying to prevent Yemen from becoming a ''rats' nest'' of terrorist groups.</p>
        <p>''It's important to not have in the gulf region places like Afghanistan that become rats' nests of terrorists and extremists,'' said Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the plan's creator and recently retired Pentagon regional commander for the Middle East. ''We were helping Yemen help itself, and everyone in the region was interested in having us help them change.''</p>
        <p>In a reversal of the common view of American diplomats that the United States military is too cautious overseas, General Zinni said several planned ship visits had been vetoed by the American ambassador to Yemen, Barbara K. Bodine, who worried about the threat of terrorists.</p>
        <p>The decision to refuel Navy ships in Aden harbor has been questioned by some counterterrorism experts since the explosion on Thursday that killed 17 sailors on the destroyer Cole. The refueling stops, done in the port's waters and not at the docks, were meant to help revive the economic fortunes of the once-bustling port and give the government the imprimatur of respectability that comes with regular American visits, the general said.</p>
        <p>The constant presence of several terrorist groups associated with the Israel-Palestinian conflict and others active against Egypt and Israel prompted the Pentagon to approve Yemen's request to help create its own coast guard to control traffic on the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea.</p>
        <p>General Zinni said he had also sent American special forces to Yemen to train the local military in counterterrorism tactics and the use of weapons. And senior officers and noncommissioned officers from Yemen are studying at military colleges in the United States.</p>
        <p>''Our big concern was terrorists' ability to move in and out of Yemen,'' he said. ''We wanted to make sure the Yemen military knew what they were doing and knew to contact us if they had a situation.''</p>
        <p>Now the Pentagon is reviewing security in Yemen to determine whether it should continue those refueling visits and who was responsible for the breach of security that led to the attack. The State Department has rejected suggestions by some Pentagon officials since the explosion that the American Embassy in Yemen was responsible for the ship's security in port.</p>
        <p>''The responsibility for operational decisions, such as refueling and security, for all U.S. ships in this region rests with the commander in chief of Central Command,'' Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said on Friday.</p>
        <p>General Zinni agreed, and said that the Navy had conducted the negotiations with the port authority at Aden for the refueling services and that he was responsible for the initial assessment that it was safe to return to Yemen after that country had suffered more than a decade of civil war and strife.</p>
        <p>Yemen's strategic position on the tip of the oil-rich Arabian peninsula was the prime motivation for the general's recommendation, despite Yemen's refusal to join the allies in the Persian Gulf war against Iraq in 1991 and the constant presence of terrorist groups in its hinterlands.</p>
        <p>But the general said he believed that Yemen was making progress at controlling those groups and would eventually evict them, and he wants the United States to continue developing its relations with Yemen.</p>
        <p>''We've had bombings in Italy, Greece, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and I didn't hear anyone say it was because we were engaged in those countries,'' he said. ''What I hope is we stay in Yemen.''</p>
