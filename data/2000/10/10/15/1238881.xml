        <p>WITH his Republican handlers confident that he is all but the presumptive winner in the First Congressional District, Felix J. Grucci Jr. seemed last week to be barely breaking a sweat in the race against  his little-known Democratic opponent, Regina Seltzer.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Grucci, 47, the three-term of Brookhaven supervisor and president of Fireworks by Grucci, a Yaphank pyrotechnics company with an international reputation, has been making the usual campaign rounds -- fall festivals, senior citizens centers, supermarkets and railroad stations.</p>
        <p>But with Ms. Seltzer's upset over Michael P. Forbes of Quogue in the Democratic primary last month, the high-stakes, nationally watched contest the Republicans had been girding for was abruptly canceled. If there has been a problem in the Grucci campaign, it has been adjusting to a suddenly much different race and believing that Ms. Seltzer posed any threat.</p>
        <p>Most analysts agreed that the real fighting was already over and had been won in part by Republican mailings to district Democrats reminding them of Mr. Forbes's very recent Republican past.</p>
        <p>But in a general election in a heavily Republican district, the dynamics have changed. A poll Republicans took shortly after the primary showed Mr. Grucci with a more than two-to-one lead over the modestly financed Ms. Seltzer. Republicans believe little has changed since then.</p>
        <p>With a $1.2 million campaign war chest that his campaign finance chairman, Mark Broxmeyer, said would swell to as much as $2 million, and the support of all seven Republican leaders in the sprawling district -- which comprises Brookhaven, Southampton, East Hampton, Shelter Island, Southold, Riverhead and the eastern half of Smithtown -- the Grucci campaign seemed to have settled into automatic pilot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Broxmeyer said that small fund-raisers, including ones hosted by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, had raised tens of thousands of dollars. He said Mr. Grucci had received less than $200,000 from the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grucci lives in East Patchogue and never went beyond Bellport High School. A burly man not known as an enthusiastic campaigner or for accessibility, he is nevertheless a seasoned politician who also has the Conservative, Right to Life and Independence lines. In an interview last week, Mr. Grucci said that if he were elected he would vote to protect Social Security, end the tax penalty on married couples, abolish inheritance taxes, guard budget surpluses against spending sprees and improve health care and education in ways proposed by the Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>As representative of a fiscally conservative but environmentally sensitive district, he said, he would support continued Federal funding for a cleanup of Long Island Sound and oppose upgrading the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to a Biosafety Level 4 facility that would allow lab scientists to study foreign viruses fatal to humans as well as animals.</p>
        <p>In a slap at Mr. Forbes, who worked to remove financing for the upgrade from the current Federal budget, Mr. Grucci said, ''I wouldn't have played little games with it and gotten it taken out of the budget for one year, I would have killed it once and for all.''</p>
        <p>As Brookhaven supervisor, he said, he had held down taxes, helped create 20,000 jobs, directed creation of a town master plan that balanced environmental protection and economic growth, and took the lead in placing a $10 million environmental bond on the town ballot. The bond measure, the first of its kind in Brookhaven, was approved by more than 75 percent of voters.</p>
        <p>Critics dismissed Mr. Grucci's efforts to present himself as an environmentalist and reformer, and said they were dismayed by Mr. Grucci's apparent escape from paying a price for presiding over a town whose reputation for real or never-quite-proven corruption had given it the nickname Crookhaven.</p>
        <p>''He is an absolute shoo-in, but only because of the incompetence of his opponents and not because of any good work he has done here,'' said Richard Johannesen, president of the Rocky Point Civic Association. ''Quite frankly, most of us are just happy he is moving on.''</p>
        <p>A civic activist, Christopher O'Connor of Selden, is suing Mr. Grucci and the town for spending more than $125,000 in town money for a media campaign promoting Brookhaven as a good place to live and do business. Mr. Grucci was prominently featured in the television and radio ads, which began appearing in February shortly after he became the Republican leaders' choice for the congressional nomination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grucci said the ads were part of ''our aggressive efforts to bring in high-tech industries'' and not self-promoting.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connor, the program director for the Long Island Neighborhood Network, said Mr. Grucci had also been instrumental in efforts by the town board to block a referendum on replacing the town's system of at-large board elections with a district system.</p>
        <p>Republicans said the changeover would be expensive and lead to inefficiencies. But some civic groups believe Republicans fear the more decentralized system would mean a loss of party control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grucci was also criticized for allowing $1,000 in town funds to pay expenses for the use of Bellport High School last April at an event where Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, endorsed Mr. Grucci. Jesse Garcia, Mr. Grucci's executive assistant, said at the time that the program was educational.</p>
        <p>Critics also said Mr. Grucci had never adequately accounted for the excavating and selling of massive amounts of sand from the 19-acre Grucci fireworks plant in Yaphank several years ago. They said the plant did not have a permit for the $800,000 transaction and that the sand mining was illegal. They also noted that the Grucci fireworks plant was under investigation as a possible source of perchlorate, a byproduct of pyrotechnics manufacturing that has been found in groundwater and private wells near the Grucci factory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grucci called revival of the sand-mining charge, which has also been leveled against him by Ms. Seltzer, ''a cheap political stunt'' that was ''not about me and my record, but an attack on my family and my family business.'' The fireworks company has said the excavation, which left a deep hole on the property, was allowed under a town-approved site plan for new buildings, though none were built.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grucci said perchlorate could have come from farms, an industrial park or a town landfill in the vicinity of the fireworks plant.</p>
        <p>Vito Minei, the director of the division of environmental quality for the Suffolk County Department of Health Services, said last week that the investigation for the source of the chemical was continuing. He said about 25 private wells had been contaminated, including three with levels of perchlorate above the state safety standard.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connor and others said Mr. Grucci should not escape responsibility for being the person in charge during the time former Suffolk and Brookhaven Republican leader John Powell, a Grucci mentor, was receiving bribes from a carter worried about losing access to the town landfill.</p>
        <p>''He was in charge when this was happening, and he was responsible for the landfill,'' Mr. O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powell, a former equipment operator in the town's highway department who became one of the most powerful Republican leaders in the state, was convicted in Federal court last December of extorting $20,000 from the carter. He pleaded guilty in February to being part of a stolen truck ring operating in the town, and was sentenced in April to 27 months in a minimum-security prison.</p>
        <p>Republicans said the Powell convictions and allegations about sand mining would have no impact on Mr. Grucci. ''All of that stuff is history, and it has never effected Felix Grucci's ability to get elected in the past,'' said Howard C. DeMartini, a senior advisor to the campaign and former two-time Suffolk Republican leader.</p>
        <p>But one Republican insider, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said Ms. Seltzer's best hope lay in attacking Mr. Grucci for ''sand mining at his plant and incompetent supervision of the landfill.''</p>
