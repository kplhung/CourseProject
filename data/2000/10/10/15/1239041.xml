        <p>Hunts Point residents and the Bronx borough president's office are engaged in a tug of war over a strip of land along the Bronx River that could become a waterside park, a truck route or possibly both.</p>
        <p>Over the summer, 10 acres of abandoned land along the Bronx River that had been the site of a cement factory was transferred to the Parks Department, which planned to build a waterfront park there. But a state Department of Transportation proposal to send thousands of trucks a day along a road bordering the property has delayed the park.</p>
        <p>With the support of the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, the state is considering using Edgewater Road, an unused strip that borders the property, to divert trucks from surrounding residential neighborhoods. Several thousand trucks a day pass through residential streets on their way to the Hunts Point food market, at the tip of the peninsula, causing pollution, congestion and traffic accidents.</p>
        <p>Alexie Torres-Fleming, executive director of a Hunts Point organization called Youth Ministries for Peace and Justice, would like to see the road become a part of the park. She has been trying to get the borough president to agree to the transfer of Edgewater Road to the Parks Department, claiming that the trucks could take alternative routes.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about the first place where there is waterfront access for 10,000 people,'' Ms. Torres-Fleming said. ''And now you're going to put trucks through it?''</p>
        <p>But the president sees the state plan ''as the only permanent long-term solution for a dedicated truck route to the Hunts Point food distribution center,'' said his spokeswoman, Arlene Mukoko.</p>
        <p>As a result of the proposed truck route, the Parks Department is considering scaling back plans for the park and making the site a ''greenway,'' depending on the results of a forthcoming environmental impact study.</p>
        <p>''We want the land used for the best possible way for the people of the Bronx,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern. ''That may or may not be a park.''</p>
