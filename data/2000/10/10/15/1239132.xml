        <p>On the Fourth of July weekend last summer, Minh Duc Hong and his twin brother, Hung, drove to this seaside resort town two hours southwest of Seattle, hoping to see fireworks. They stopped for food at a gas station here, where they were spotted by a group of white men waving a Confederate flag.</p>
        <p>The men used an ethnic slur, and shouted ''go home'' and ''white power'' as they waved the flag and pounded on the gas station windows, the police and prosecutors here say. The Hong brothers fled to their parked car, where one of the white men, Christopher Kinison, 20, punched Hung Hong in the face, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>When the Hongs fought back, Minh Hong used a kitchen knife from the gas station to stab Mr. Kinison, killing him, witnesses told the police.  When it was over, the police arrested the Hong brothers and characterized  the fight as an all-too-typical late-night fracas that got out of hand.  Minh Hong was charged with manslaughter and is now free on bail.</p>
        <p>But now a number of Asian-American civil rights groups have asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether the police were lax in responding to a contagion of hate through this town for one long weekend. They say the death occurred amid a spurt of racial harassment by Mr. Kinison and his friends. Had the police acted earlier, Mr. Kinison would not have been free to harass the Hongs, the Asian-American groups say.</p>
        <p>Just one day before the fight at the gas station, Mr. Kinison was with a group of white men who confronted two Filipino families, shouting at them and punching at the windows of their cars, the Ocean Shores police said. The white men shouted, ''What are you doing in our town?'' witnesses told the police.</p>
        <p>The Filipinos were given a police escort out of town -- at their own request, prosecutors say -- but no arrests were made of the whites. Three Asian-American civil rights groups say the whites should have been arrested on racial harassment charges, this state's equivalent of a hate crime statute.</p>
        <p>''If handled differently by local law enforcement, bystanders and other members of the community, perhaps the fatal altercation could have been prevented,'' wrote leaders of the Japanese-American Citizens League, one of three groups pressing the F.B.I. for an inquiry.</p>
        <p>In another case on the same weekend, a black man said Mr. Kinison and several other white men chased him down the beach with a knife, using racial insults.</p>
        <p>''The police see these cases as just boys will be boys,'' said Karen Yoshitomi of the Japanese-American Citizens League. ''That's just hooey. This group of whites was clearly targeting people of color. The police response was to do nothing. And that's why we have to go to the F.B.I.''</p>
        <p>Officials of the bureau in Seattle have not said whether they plan to  open an investigation, although police officials here say they have not been asked any questions by federal authorities.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yoshitomi said that Asians should have reason to fear coming to this town of 3,200 people, which is dependent on tourists and convention gatherings for most of its income. ''There's a feeling that nothing has been done to recognize a hate crime when it happens,'' Ms. Yoshitomi said.</p>
        <p>In the letter to the bureau, the leaders of the three Asian-American civil rights groups wrote, ''Our community remains frustrated over what is perceived as the failure of law enforcement to pursue hate crimes against Asian-Americans and the ability of law enforcement to protect us.''</p>
        <p>The Hong case has prompted much soul-searching and second-guessing in this overwhelmingly white resort community. Racial crimes are not much of a problem, people here say, but, as is the case in many small towns, the police are criticized for failing to detect patterns of racial hatred.</p>
        <p>''If somebody is waving a Confederate flag in this town, the police should be called,'' said Vini Samuels, a lawyer whose family is from India. ''I know I would call the police. But generally, minorities should have no reason to fear coming here.''</p>
        <p>The police and prosecutors in Ocean Shores say they acted properly, but were unable to make racial harassment arrests because the victims did not wish to press charges.</p>
        <p>''We are not the kind of community that has a lot of trouble with racists,'' said Rich McEachin, the Ocean Shores police chief. ''One bad weekend over 20 years is a pretty good record.''</p>
        <p>Chief McEachin said the Filipinos who had been confronted by the whites a day before their run-in with the Hong brothers simply wanted to leave town and did not press for further police action. ''Without their cooperation, we don't have a case,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And in the case of the black man who said he was chased, no police action was taken because none of the suspected assailants were identified until after their confrontation with the Hongs, Chief McEachin said.</p>
        <p>''We have zero tolerance on hate crimes,'' the chief said. ''But with a small police department, you can't do much if people don't cooperate.''</p>
        <p>A far-right group associated with David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader from Louisiana, has called on prosecutors here to press murder charges against Minh Hong. No charges were ever brought against his brother.</p>
        <p>''This is an outrage,'' said David Jensen, a spokesman for the group, the National Organization for European-American Rights. ''This man is walking the streets today and being treated like a victim because he is Asian-American. Is it now acceptable for minorities to kill European-Americans for calling them names?''</p>
        <p>The man at the center of the case, Mr. Hong, 26, lives in Seattle and has  no criminal record. His family came to the United States from Vietnam 20 years ago and started a restaurant, where Mr. Hong worked. He is now studying computer science while working at an Internet company.</p>
        <p>The police say Mr. Hong, at 5 feet 6 inches, was much smaller than Mr. Kinison, who was over 6 feet.</p>
        <p>''This is a little meek person who thought he was going to die and acted out of self-defense,'' said Brett Purtzer, a lawyer for Mr. Hong.</p>
