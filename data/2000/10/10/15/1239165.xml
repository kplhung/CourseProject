        <p>From the standing-room-only logjam near the stage to the nosebleed seats near the championship banners of the Knicks and Rangers, about 15,000 people of all ages, hair colors and political backgrounds filled Madison Square Garden on Friday night for the biggest rally yet supporting Ralph Nader's presidential bid.</p>
        <p>The sold-out, four-hour rally was dubbed ''Nader Rocks the Garden,'' and he did. With thousands of supporters stomping and chanting ''LET'S go, NA-der!'' (as in ''LET'S go, RAN-gers!'') and Bill Murray, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Patti Smith joining the biggest contingent of celebrities so far at any Nader rally, the scene seemed more appropriate for a concert or sports event than the long-shot candidacy of a rumpled consumer advocate.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to the politics of joy and justice,'' Mr. Nader said in an hour-long speech that skewered the political and corporate establishment for controlling America and excluding him from the presidential debates. ''We are building a historic, progressive, political movement in America.''</p>
        <p>Yet for all of the enthusiasm of the adoring crowd, Mr. Nader has not exactly rocked the presidential race, having been stalled for months at about 4 percent in national polls. And in recent weeks, with Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas locked in a stubbornly tight race, Democrats have intensified their appeals to Nader supporters, particularly in swing states.</p>
        <p>People interviewed at the Garden were well aware of the problem: that a vote for Mr. Nader would only help Mr. Bush. Most said that while this made them think harder about their vote, they would still side with Mr. Nader and the Green Party because, as Mr. Nader likes to say, both front-runners are corporate mendicants in favor of the death penalty, globalization and corporate donations, and are thus interchangeable.</p>
        <p>''I have to live with myself,'' said Jennifer Maslowski, a 29-year-old fine arts appraiser and freelance writer in Manhattan who, though leaning toward Gore earlier this week, was so moved at the rally that she pulled out her cell phone to call her mother in upstate New York and got her to promise to switch to Nader, too. ''My life is not going to change very much if either Bush or Gore are elected,'' Ms. Maslowski said.</p>
        <p>In the last couple of months, Mr. Nader's campaign has enjoyed a bit of a second wind with what the Nader campaign has called ''super rallies'' in cities like Boston, Chicago and Seattle, which have attracted more than 10,000 people each time out. New York was the biggest to date; the next two are scheduled for Austin, Tex., and Oakland, Calif.</p>
        <p>This being New York, the suggested price of admission was considerably higher than the other stops to help defray the $200,000 bill for renting the Garden: $20 versus $10 elsewhere. To his supporters, though, Mr. Nader, who does not accept soft money, hard money or corporate gifts, was well worth it, as he upbraided corporate America and both political parties, and appealed to the disgruntled and disenchanted.</p>
        <p>''Please come in,'' Mr. Nader exhorted. ''Don't drop out of democracy. We even need your skepticism.''</p>
        <p>The event began with a video of Mr. Nader's accomplishments, and continued with documentary video from the protests this year in Seattle and Washington. Phil Donahue was the master of ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Michael Moore, the filmmaker,  lambasted the front-runners. ''A vote for Gore is a vote for Bush,'' he said. ''If they both believe in the same thing, wouldn't you want the original than the copy? Wouldn't you want Bush? Sirloin or hamburger? Which would you go for?''</p>
        <p>Bill Murray told a few jokes. Ms. Sarandon spoke earnestly. Patti Smith, Ani DiFranco and Ben Harper sang. So did Eddie Vedder, the lead singer of Pearl Jam, who sang ''The Times They Are A-Changin.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most eccentric performance was by Mr. Robbins, who appeared in a wheelchair and dark glasses as Bob Roberts, the title character of his 1992 film about a manipulative right-wing Senate candidate (which features a song titled, ''Times Are Changing Back'').</p>
        <p>''I dedicate this to W., or as we call him the locker room, Boy George,'' Mr. Robbins said.</p>
        <p>The Bob Roberts routine escaped a good number of supporters, particularly college students too young to have seen or heard of the film. But in conversation after conversation, many of those interviewed offered not a staccato of sound bites and cliches, but rambling and passionate discourses about the issues.</p>
        <p>For Jim Davis, 27, a Rutgers graduate student who participated in the protest against Mr. Nader's exclusion from the debate in Boston, Mr. Nader is the only candidate to address universal health care, criminal justice reform and globalization. So Mr. Davis is a campus coordinator for the campaign.</p>
        <p>Even if the race in New Jersey were tighter, he would still refuse to vote for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''I'm not afraid of Bush,'' said Mr. Davis, who didn't vote in 1996 because he did not like any of the choices. ''I'm just a disgruntled citizen.''</p>
        <p>For Chrissy Fiorentini, a 19-year-old student at Columbia, the candidate with the most promise was Bill Bradley, and she worked as a campaign volunteer. But after Mr. Bradley lost, she was so repulsed by the Gore campaign that she decided to help Mr. Nader's campaign try to reach the 5 percent vote needed for federal funds in the 2004 election.</p>
        <p>''Gore just betrayed everyone in the Democratic party,'' said Ms. Fiorentini, whose top issues include universal health care, the death penalty and world trade.</p>
        <p>The crowd did not only consist of supporters barely old enough to vote or buy alcohol. In fact, the crowd was fairly diverse in age and in ethnicity, and included a handful of independents or former Republicans who had voted for former Senator Bob Dole in 1996, as well as veteran radicals and anti-war activists still indignant about the distribution of wealth and power.</p>
        <p>Many Nader supporters wished aloud that that they could have it both ways: to watch Mr. Bush lose, and make Mr. Gore sweat.</p>
        <p>''Hoping that Bush will win is too much to ask of anybody; he's so nasty,'' said Ms. Maslowski, the fine arts appraiser. ''But I hope it'll be close, and I hope Gore knows why he's losing votes.''</p>
