        <p>BELMONT  6 Brothers With Chisels And the Art They Made</p>

        <p>ST. GEORGE  The People of Staten Island Well Before Columbus</p>
        <p>When the first humans arrived on Staten Island more than 12,000 years ago, they encountered a bleak, tundralike landscape and a cold climate. The lives of these settlers are explored in an exhibit at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, titled ''The Lenape: The First Staten Islanders.'' (At left, a stone head that was found in the Concord section in 1884.)</p>
        <p>In addition to specimens like these, an assortment of local Indian artifacts will help illustrate the lives of the Lenape people, including an array of stone tools like projectile points (arrowheads), grooved axes, mortars, pestles, hammer stones and reconstructed clay pots.</p>
        <p>The exhibit will also examine archaeological methods, specifically  how the past is recreated and understood from the scraps of what remains.</p>
        <p>''The Lenape: The First Staten Islanders''; through Dec. 31, open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 1 to 5 p.m. Sunday; Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, 75 Stuyvesant Place, near Wall Street; suggested donation $2.50 adults, $1.50 students and people 62 or older; (718) 727-1135.</p>
