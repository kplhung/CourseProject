        <p>John Moran tells his friends not to drive onto his block on weekends.</p>
        <p>''The cars see the light change from red to green at least five times before they even approach the intersection,'' said Mr. Moran, who lives near what has become the center of the Indian commercial district in Jackson Heights. ''It's just an area that's oversaturated with cars.''</p>
        <p>Every weekend, shoppers from the three neighboring states as well as international visitors descend on 73rd and 74th Streets between 35th Avenue and 37th Road. While the  area has grown tremendously during the last 15 years, the number of parking spaces has stayed the same. Residents say the disparity has created noisy, congested roadways.</p>
        <p>''I don't particularly care about the number of cars,'' said Mr. Moran, a lawyer. ''What I care about is the horn honking.''</p>
        <p>Karl Christensen, president of the Jackson Heights Civic Association, said: ''The out-of-town people coming in and double and triple parking, especially on Saturday and Sundays. This is what's causing the grief.''</p>
        <p>Community Board 3, local residents and the city all agree that  congestion is a problem. But there is no consensus on a solution.</p>
        <p>Councilman John D. Sabini, who represents Jackson Heights, wants the Department of Transportation to honor the findings of its 1998 traffic study of the business district.</p>
        <p>In the study, the department suggested that 35th and 37th Avenues be made into one-way streets. The department later abandoned the plan. Peter Pennica, assistant commissioner for traffic planning, said the department decided that a better solution would be truck loading zones and angled parking to create 80 more parking spaces.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sabini said the original plan was better.</p>
        <p>''The traffic planners that did that study knew what they were talking about,'' Mr. Sabini said.</p>
        <p>Community Board 3 is working with several city agencies to alleviate the problem.</p>
        <p>''There really is no foolproof solution,'' said Giovanna Reid, the board's district manager. ''There are few parking spaces and more cars than this small area can handle.''</p>
        <p>Deputy Inspector Christopher Jamison said officers would enforce the traffic laws more vigorously and hand out fliers to educate out-of-town shoppers about fines for double parking.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to be able to make that problem totally go away,'' Inspector Jamison said. ''But I can control it.''</p>
