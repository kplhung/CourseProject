        <p>ELEVEN years ago, a show jump-started and then slipped out of Teaneck, by all accounts a loser, never for all the world to see. Now it has come home a legend, or as close to one as any popular entertainment calling itself theater appears to be.</p>
        <p>Although the American Stage Company, which gave the play its first major production in 1988, has a right to claim ''Forever Plaid'' as its own discovery, the show's creator, Stuart Ross, makes it clear that New Jersey was not its birthing place. Call ''Forever Plaid,'' playing at the Becton Theater through next Sunday, in a very revised version, the Teaneck theater's adoptive child.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross said that in 1987 the West Bank Cafe, on 42nd Street in Manhattan, was the true birthing place for the novelty show about a would-be 1940's guy group, in the manner of the Ames Brothers, the Four Lads but mostly, the Four Aces.</p>
        <p>''We then went to the O'Neill as a 10th anniversary entertainment,'' Mr. Ross said, emphasizing that the show had no evolutionary phase at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn.</p>
        <p>It was in a cabaret in Rochester that ''I got the idea to kill them,'' Mr. Ross said about the fictitious Plaids. True to the show business mandate that ''you gotta have a gimmick,'' the group dies on the way to see the Beatles on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on Feb. 9, 1964. Cause of death: collision with a Catholic school bus, driven by a nun.</p>
        <p>''Forever Plaid'' is often likened to ''Nunsense'' as a generator of box-office power. ''Nunsense,'' a show about singing and dancing nuns, was running in repertory with ''Forever Plaid'' in Rochester. ''That's where I got the idea about a big busload of Catholic schoolgirls and it made all the difference,'' Mr. Ross said in a telephone coversation from his home in Hollywood. For a plot line, the dead Plaids, out of a time warp, relive the past.</p>
        <p>But they were not allowed to die in New Jersey. ''The producers asked for rewrites and we had to make them live,'' Mr. Ross went on. The result was a very long, incoherent story about the reunion of a wannabe singing group. ''We were such a failure,'' Mr. Ross said. ''The show ran two-and-a-half hours, it didn't work and there was no time to fix it.''</p>
        <p>While the singers were not killed in New Jersey, it looked as though New Jersey may have killed the show. ''We got canceled everywhere and they handed the rights back to me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ross would not let ''Forever Plaid'' die, not the way ''Starmites'' did.</p>
        <p>''Starmites'' was a 1989 Broadway musical flop for which Mr. Ross wrote the book. ''It was that same terrible year,'' he said, referring to the year ''Forever Plaid'' shut down in Teaneck. ''I was down as low as you could be. I thought, 'What do I have to lose?' ''</p>
        <p>So he put $26,000 on his credit card, shopped ''Forever Plaid'' to Steve McGraw's, then a cabaret on West 72 Street in Manhattan, and the Plaids, dead once more, began a new life that same year.</p>
        <p>A year later, the show was expanded from a cabaret revue to a real theater piece, remaining in the same space. Still, it was a spare show, the plot line became a through line for a story about, in Mr. Ross's words, ''lovable losers, sweet dreams, the creaminess of harmonies and a time of innocence.''</p>
        <p>''Forever Plaid,'' upgraded to Off-Broadway status, ran more than four years. But by 1990, touring companies were popping up, it seemed, everywhere, starting in San Diego, and in theaters and clubs of all sizes.</p>
        <p>Asked about how many ''Forever Plaid'' productions there are now or have ever been, Mr. Ross answered, ''I have no idea,'' trying to count the ones he has been involved in and coming up with ''maybe 55 productions and five or six tours.''</p>
        <p>The show is still so much with us, Mr. Ross could be still counting, but why bother?</p>
        <p>There are some productions of ''Forever Plaid'' that Mr. Ross is not aware of. For example, he did not know of one now running in Waterbury, Conn., and scheduled to move to Bridgeport next month, but he did know of stagings in Las Vegas, San Diego and Chicago.</p>
        <p>''There were four tours in Canada,'' he said. ''We ran five years in Toronto -- and they're always dead -- except in Teaneck.''</p>
        <p>But this time in Teaneck, things will be going Mr. Ross's way. When he is not up-to-date on the Plaids' travels ''it's because I don't have my name on them,'' he said. The American Stage production has his name and his approval. He recently spent a week in Teaneck, overseeing rehearsals. The show is directed and choreographed by Larry Raben, who was assistant to Mr. Ross in the original Off-Broadway incarnation.</p>
        <p>''I said to Matthew that we have to make this one as good as it can be -- and it is our highest good,'' Mr. Ross said, referring to Matthew Parent, the theater's new producing artistic director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parent, who said he produced the show ''for strictly commercial reasons'' in 1995 at the American Stage Festival in New Hampshire, where he was artistic director for seven years, said, ''It really gets people in the door.'' And that guarantee gave the green light to more adventurous productions in that theater. He hopes that ''Forever Paid,'' second time around, will do just that for American Stage, which has four new plays and one revival on its agenda in its 15th season.</p>
        <p>''The show is now funnier, lighter, shorter than it was in 1988,'' Mr. Parent said. ''It focuses on the music. And it's a phenomenon like 'Nunsense.' ''</p>
        <p>''Nunsense'' has had one sequel after another. Is that in store for ''Forever Plaid?''</p>
        <p>''Well, maybe a prequel,'' Mr. Ross said. And if it starts out in Teaneck, Mr. Parent will be sure not to hand back the rights.</p>
