        <p>One by one, the Seattle Mariners acknowledged Roger Clemens's greatness tonight in the Yankees' 5-0 victory, offering awestruck testimonials that matched the pitches they tried to hit.</p>
        <p>Whether watching fastballs that darted in unexpected ways or being mesmerized by curveballs and sliders that danced to unfamiliar beats, the Mariners were left grasping for adjectives after falling behind three games to one in the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>The Yankees can make their third consecutive trip to the World Series with a victory in Game 5 here on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Al Martin broke up Clemens's bid for a no-hitter with a leadoff double in the seventh inning, hitting a slider down the right-field line.</p>
        <p>''It came in on me and I got my hands around in time,'' Martin said.</p>
        <p>''I still thought Tino Martinez might catch it,'' he added, referring to the Yankees' first baseman.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if Clemens can pitch better than that. He threw me one 92 mile-per-hour forkball that dropped a foot. Take your pick of the pitches he threw.</p>
        <p>''It was all pretty nasty stuff. I knew we were in for a long night on the second pitch he threw me.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners said Clemens tried to set an intimidating tone in the first inning when he fired two fastballs high and tight to Alex Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>''You can never tell,'' Edgar Martinez said. ''Clemens is such a professional.</p>
        <p>''He never shows his emotions. He hits both sides of the plate, so you always wonder what he's doing. Nobody likes to be pitched that high when a guy is throwing 97 miles an hour, but that's the game.''</p>
        <p>Rodriguez, who struck out twice and walked once, took the message personally.</p>
        <p>''It's puzzling how that can happen when a guy has such good control,'' Rodriguez said. ''It's funny how he never misses up and away. It's always up and in. It's some stuff I'm angry about, but I'll get over it.''</p>
        <p>Martin added: ''It woke us up. When you face Roger, there's a good chance that someone is going to face some chin music. That's good old-fashioned pitching. That's just part of the game.''</p>
        <p>Martinez said he struck out on one pitch he had never seen Clemens throw before -- a slider that backed up into his fists.</p>
        <p>''You try to be patient, but all you could do was get in the hole with two strikes and try to stay aggressive against him,'' Martinez said. ''I was trying to protect the outside of the plate and it just buzzed in on me. He had command of every pitch.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners had enough problems before facing Clemens, who had at least two fastballs that were measured at 99 miles an hour. They were batting .224 against the Yankees, .45 below their season average, and had failed to produce clutch hits in numerous scoring situations. For the series, the Mariners had been outscored by 15-5.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mariners Manager Lou Piniella tried to ignite some kind of spark by overhauling his lineup for Game 4.</p>
        <p>Out were Jay Buhner (0 for 6), Rickey Henderson (2 for 6), Mark McLemore (2 for 9 with two errors) and Joe Oliver (1 for 6). In were Stan Javier, Al Martin and Dan Wilson, who were a combined 2 for 12 against the Yankees, and Carlos Guillen, who had yet to bat in the series.</p>
        <p>''We're fine, we're fine,'' Piniella said before the game. ''I think we've gotten ourselves into a little bit of a hole, but our mood is fine.</p>
        <p>We've been up against the wall before this year, and we've managed to fight back.''</p>
        <p>But the changes did nothing to enliven the Mariners' offense and certainly had little effect against Clemens. After Martin ended the no-hit bid in the seventh, Clemens quickly recovered, striking out Rodriguez for the second time and Edgar Martinez. After walking John Olerud, Clemens got Mike Cameron to watch a curveball slice across the outside corner for the inning's final out.</p>
        <p>By then, the Yankees had built a 3-0 lead off Paul Abbott, who left after complaining of tightness in his right shoulder while warming up for the seventh inning.</p>
        <p>Abbott pitched four shutout innings before Derek Jeter's three-run home run in the fifth moved the Yankees within one victory of their fourth World Series appearance in five years.</p>
        <p>Once again, the Yankees tapped into the Mariners' bullpen to pad their lead, scoring two runs in the eighth on David Justice's home run off Jose Mesa.</p>
        <p>In their previous two losses, the Mariners were done in by late-inning relief meltdowns. Those two rallies produced 11 runs on 12 hits and suddenly made the Yankees' late-season slump long forgotten and forgiven.</p>
        <p>In the end, Clemens's dominance overshadowed Seattle's bullpen problem and its lackluster offense. But if the Mariners do not address both issues by Sunday afternoon, their season will be over.</p>
