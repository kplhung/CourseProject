        <p>A plan to ease congestion along the western edge of Houston Street has upset residents and local business people, who say it would ruin their neighborhood and endanger pedestrians.</p>
        <p>The Department of Transportation has proposed widening Houston Street between Avenue of the Americas and West Street by three feet. It plans to do this by narrowing the sidewalks to unclog traffic feeding into the Holland Tunnel and the West Side Highway.</p>
        <p>''It's bumper to bumper traffic,'' said Tom Cocola, a Transportation Department spokesman. ''Houston Street has been a problem for both pedestrians and motorists.''</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, much of the street was widened to accommodate the Avenue of the Americas subway lines that approach from the east along Houston Street. The rest of the artery was left intact, and the road narrows from a four-lane boulevard to a one-way street at the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
        <p>Residents along West Houston Street say the expansion would turn their tree-lined block between the Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street into a highway.</p>
        <p>''People live and work here,'' said Electa Brown, vice president of the West Houston Street Block Association, who has lived on the street for three decades. ''They are making this into a truck route although it's a residential neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>Karen Cooper, director of the Film Forum, an independent theater at 209 West Houston Street, said the plan would endanger moviegoers.</p>
        <p>''Nearly 300,000 come to the Film Forum each year,'' Ms. Cooper said. ''That's a big number of people who line up on the sidewalks. It seems like a silly, costly, cumbersome and foolish idea.''</p>
        <p>Rather than widen the street, community leaders say, it would be simpler and more effective to remove parking spaces along one side. Parking is currently barred during the day but generally allowed at night.</p>
        <p>As for the suggestion to eliminate parking, Mr. Cocola said the Transportation Department had not made its plan final and would consider that as an alternative.</p>
        <p>''The people are sometimes a better barometer,'' he said.</p>
