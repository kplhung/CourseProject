        <p>IMAGINE this for a moment: no Pierre Boulez. Not only would we be without some of the most fascinating music of the last half-century, but everyone else's music would also be different, for Mr. Boulez's influence as a composer has been ubiquitous.</p>
        <p>In the sphere of performance, nobody would have been encouraging the Vienna Philharmonic to discover Webern as its birthright, the Cleveland Orchestra to take Ravel and Messiaen as its own. Nobody in modern times would have been pushing for a firm place for contemporary music in the regular orchestral repertory. There would be no ensembles for new music, since it was Mr. Boulez who invented the idea in the early 1950's. Wagner interpretation would not have been revitalized.</p>

        <p>IMAGINE this for a moment: no Pierre Boulez. Not only would we be without some of the most fascinating music of the last half-century, but everyone else's music would also be different, for Mr. Boulez's influence as a composer has been ubiquitous.</p>
        <p>In the sphere of performance, nobody would have been encouraging the Vienna Philharmonic to discover Webern as its birthright, the Cleveland Orchestra to take Ravel and Messiaen as its own. Nobody in modern times would have been pushing for a firm place for contemporary music in the regular orchestral repertory. There would be no ensembles for new music, since it was Mr. Boulez who invented the idea in the early 1950's. Wagner interpretation would not have been revitalized.</p>
        <p>Important works by a vast number of other composers -- Elliott Carter, Gyorgy Ligeti, Harrison Birtwistle -- would never have been commissioned or recorded. And there would have been no one to keep contemporary music in the public eye, especially in the public eye represented by the television camera.</p>
        <p>Next Saturday and Sunday, the Museum of Television and Radio in midtown, in collaboration with Carnegie Hall, is presenting showings of Boulez documentaries and opera tapes (Berg's ''Lulu,'' Wagner's ''Ring'') from the last 25 years. Mr. Boulez will be there to introduce the programs and talk to old Philharmonic colleagues, some of whom -- a former president, Carlos Moseley, and the longtime principal clarinetist, Stanley Drucker -- were in the studio when the earliest of these documentaries, a three-part series produced by ''Camera Three,'' was made in 1975.</p>
        <p>So different the world was then. An hour and a half was being devoted to problems of playing and programming adventurous music, including performances of pieces by Edgard Varese and Arnold Schoenberg, Peter Lieberson and Jacob Druckman. It all mattered -- as indeed it does matter, but does not seem to matter in discussions going on today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boulez, at the height of his problems with the Philharmonic, looks awkward. He is being encouraged to justify himself -- by words and by deeds of conducting -- at a time when his audience, his orchestra and his board are all losing faith in him. He smiles and laughs too much, looks off camera too much. But perhaps the face one remembers best is not his. One of the conversations, faithfully recorded, features members of the orchestra; a violist, given a rare opportunity to condescend, looks wonderfully superior as a percussionist praises the new professional opportunities and challenges provided by contemporary music.</p>
        <p>Only seven years later, in the BBC program ''Boulez Now,'' Mr. Boulez looks a lot grayer and a lot more tired. He has moved from the Philharmonic to Ircam, the institute for electronic music built for him by Georges Pompidou to lure him back to Paris from his regular homes in New York, London and Germany. And he has exchanged one set of problems for another. Ircam -- though this is not said -- has proved a minefield to manage. There have been spectacular resignations. In addition, Mr. Boulez is under creative pressure. This was his opportunity to return to full compositional work, after achieving rather little in the previous two decades. The program duly focuses on the big new piece he has produced, ''Repons,'' for tuned percussions instruments with electronics and chamber orchestra. But even he does not seem very enthusiastic about it.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward to 1999, to a BBC documentary, ''Pierre Boulez: A Life in Seven Chapters,'' which has not yet been shown in this country. Now Mr. Boulez looks thoroughly genial and relaxed. The difference must be attributed partly to his interviewer, Roger Wright, a BBC administrator, but the man himself, too, has changed. For 20 years and more, he directed important institutions: the Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, Ircam. Now he can give his time to personal projects. Also -- though this may be a sadness as much as a relief -- his new works are not expected to justify some manifesto and alter the course of musical history.</p>
        <p>Part of his most recent big piece, ''Sur Incises,'' is observed in rehearsal. But it is knocked aside by an extract from his world-changing opus of 40 years before, ''Le Marteau Sans Maitre,'' seen in the television version of the mid-60's, which has never been bettered as an essay in visualizing musical performance. With precision editing, lighting and camera work, this recording reflects the music's vivacity and intensity, and should have been included in full in any salute to Boulez on television.</p>
        <p>NEVER mind; ''A Life in Seven Chapters'' tells us a lot. Mr. Boulez talks about his decision, when he was 17, to devote himself to music. ''Whoever would be against it, I would fight.'' So, Mr. Wright asks, can friends be a support, a solace? No. Mr. Boulez looks totally unmoved, displaying the independence that has been his strength and also his limitation. ''You are confronted with difficulties, you have to be stronger.''</p>
        <p>Another revealing moment, in a different key, comes when Mr. Boulez chooses the image of the spiral as his ideal for the musical work and for life. Like a visitor to the spiral that is the Guggenheim Museum, he says, you should be able, from your situation in the present, to look across at where you have come from and where you will go.</p>
        <p>He has that perspective. To Mr. Wright's remark that he looks ''so much calmer, so much more at ease,'' Mr. Boulez replies with another image. A human life is like a river. It starts in the mountains, cascading and fast. Then it slows, but ''the stream is much stronger.''</p>
