        <p>''One Home's Unplanned Addition: A Courtroom'' (Oct. 1) offered a cautionary tale about how disputes between homeowners and contractors can escalate.

        <p>''One Home's Unplanned Addition: A Courtroom'' (Oct. 1) offered a cautionary tale about how disputes between homeowners and contractors can escalate. But I would suggest that in the case described in the article, the decision to use a lawyered adversarial process was the essential mistake.</p>
        <p>An alternative would have been to settle the dispute with the help of a neutral individual, skilled in conflict resolution techniques and having an in-depth knowledge of construction. Such mediation is confidential and nonbinding, and the settlements are crafted by the parties themselves, allowing creative and cost-effective solutions to be considered.</p>
