        <p>ROSANO-Michael. Political activist, respected publicist, and devoted friend. He began his career in public television at Channel 13. He worked for Manhattan Borough President and City Council President Andrew Stein as deputy press secretary and for City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman as a community liaison. He served the gay and lesbian community as political director of the Empire State Pride Agenda and of the Anti-Violence Project, and served all New Yorkers until his passing as Deputy Communications Director to State Senator Martin Connor, Minority Leader of the New York State Senate. A faithful supporter of Congresswoman Bella Abzug throughout her career, a democrat in all senses, Michael was warm, generous, witty, and loving: loyal to his friends, to the causes he believed in, to the public interest he served with selflessness, dignity, humor, and honor. In our sorrow, we remember the strength, courage, and grace with which Michael endured until the end, and we join the Rosano family in grief. Eve Abzug, Liz Abzug, Barbara Baer, William Bryk, Ronnie Eldridge, C. Virginia Fields, Harold Holzer, Elizabeth Holtzman, Brenda Levin, Jesse Masyr, Walter McCaffrey, Martin McLaughlin, John Mullins, Maggi Peyton, Andrew Stein</p>
        <p>ROSANO-Michael. The Board of Directors and Staff of the Empire State Pride Agenda mourn the passing of our friend and colleague Michael Rosano. He was our Political Director and worked tirelessly throughout his career to elect pro-gay candidates. We will miss his passion, dry wit &amp; savvy sense of politics. Our condolences to his wide circle of family, friends and colleagues. Jeff Soref and Kate Galivan Co-Chairs of the Board Matt Foreman, Exec Director</p>
