        <p>Officials from the Chevron Corporation and Texaco Inc. spent yesterday working on  details of a combination valued at about $36 billion that would create the fourth largest oil company in the world, according to executives close to the talks.</p>
        <p>The boards of both companies are scheduled to meet this afternoon to vote on Chevron's acquisition of Texaco. If approved, an announcement of the deal is planned for Monday morning before financial markets open, the executives said.</p>
        <p>In June 1999, Texaco's board rejected a $37.5 billion offer from Chevron, after the two companies clashed over the price and management structure of the proposed deal.  Analysts have long believed that a Chevron-Texaco deal would be a logical move if they wanted to be able to effectively compete against the likes of Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/ Shell, and BP Amoco. Executives close to the negotiations said they hope to squeeze as much as $1 billion in savings as a result of the deal as well as make the combined company more competitive in developing new oil and gas fields.</p>
