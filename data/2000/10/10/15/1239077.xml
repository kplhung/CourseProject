        <p>ONE of Vice President Al Gore's favorite stories is about the time he fell for a trick played on him as a cub reporter at the Nashville Tennessean. He was writing obituaries one night when a funeral director called to report that a Swedish gynecologist, a certain Trebla Erog, had passed away. Subsequent calls -- secretly placed by one of Mr. Gore's colleagues, Jerry Thompson -- kept adding dramatic details. Finally, he learned that the doctor's distraught wife had died, too, on her way to the hospital.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gore told it at a memorial service for Mr. Thompson earlier this year, he not only fell for the gag, but shouted at his editors to hold page one: ''This thing is getting better all the time!'' But hearing the story told this way alarmed the vice president's former editor, Frank Ritter, who has a signed photo of the Gores in his office.</p>
        <p>''Thompson and I set him up on Trebla Erog'' -- Albert Gore spelled backwards -- ''but Al caught on pretty quickly,'' Mr. Ritter said in an interview several months back. It was another reporter, Mr. Ritter explained, who had been taken in. ''But Al made himself the goat. It was funny, funny, but it didn't happen that way. I said to my honey, 'I'm worried. He's just said he invented the Internet and he and Tipper were the models for ''Love Story.'' He ought to be more careful.' ''</p>
        <p>In fact, he is careful, sometimes excruciatingly so. In more than a dozen long interviews for a series of biographical articles over the last six months, Mr. Gore constantly monitored his own storytelling, self-editing as he spoke, trying hard to stick to what he knew to be true. ''Now, this is a family anecdote,'' he'd say, ''that like a lot of family anecdotes I can't really vouch for.''</p>
        <p>In a tight presidential race his colorized storytelling is no minor issue, with Republicans clearly exaggerating the exaggerations and Democrats worrying that the perception they're peddling could wind up losing him the race. Suddenly, details, details, could decide it all. That's probably because in a healthy economy, the heir to a still popular president, a man of considerable experience who a majority of Americans agree with on the issues, has as yet been unable to close the sale. For lack of a better way to get a handle on why this is so, the issue of Mr. Gore's exaggerations seems to be standing in for larger, fuzzier questions about his personal appeal.</p>
        <p>Various friends, who allow that he has a habit of exaggerating, have various theories about why: That it's all in the tradition of southern storytelling. Or that it's the legacy of his political parents. His father, Senator Albert Gore, was himself considered a standout exaggerator in his day, even by Mr. Gore and his mother, both of whom have been quoted to that effect.</p>
        <p>Or they point to the way Mr. Gore was raised, by parents who always had one eye on his political future. They were improving his resume before he was old enough to have one. When he was six, an item in the Knoxville News-Sentinel had Senator Gore bragging that Little Al had ''out-talked a senator'' when he got his dad to buy him a 98-cent bow and arrow set rather than the 49-cent model the senator had chosen: ''He's a budding politician. There may be another Gore on the way to the political pinnacle. He's just six years old now. But with his experiences to date, who knows what may happen?'' How could Mr. Gore be expected to know what was real and what was hype?</p>
        <p>HERE he is, for example, struggling to stay within the lines even while reminiscing about some Tennessee cousins: ''I lived with them when I was younger. When I was four years old my parents dropped me off there one day.'' But wait, he'd lived with them only briefly, during his father's first senatorial campaign, and wanted to clear it up, afraid of overstating something that was, for my purposes, irrelevant. ''In the heat of the campaign, I lived with that family,'' he amended. ''With Uncle Toadie, who's a well driller.''</p>
        <p>So, at age four, ''I went out and drilled wells. Well, I didn't drill wells. I went out and played around while they drilled wells. And they had a baboon. Not a baboon, but some kind of big monkey in the backyard.'' And so forth.</p>
        <p>Despite his determination, some of the things he told me were not so. Yet, mostly, he improved on the facts in ways that did not really improve them -- with stories that did not seem designed to better his political chances. He does aim to please, though. And when he tells a lot of these stories, like the one about his days as a kid reporter excited about his page one article on Trebla Erog, he seems, above all, to be looking to be liked.</p>
        <p>Many times in our interviews, Mr. Gore cast his life much as his parents would have, and was protective of them, surely lying more to himself than to me when he said that no, he was never lonely as a kid -- though virtually all his boyhood friends remember he was, terribly.</p>
        <p>''There was never a moment I felt the slightest push or urging'' to follow his father into politics, he said. ''There wasn't any expressed desire or manipulation or plan.''</p>
        <p>He was occasionally self-aggrandizing, as when he recalled that when he was a low-ranking enlisted man at Fort Rucker, Ala., Gen. William Westmoreland interrupted a formal departure ceremony to chat with him for an incredible 45 minutes. An Army buddy who was there recalled they talked for just a few minutes -- five, maybe.</p>
        <p>He seems to view his story in heroic terms, a bit like a movie, with music swelling at appropriate moments. After he went to Congress, he said, ''I guess it sounds corny, but if there had been a soundtrack, 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic' would have been hummed in the background.''</p>
        <p>Yet a number of the stories that clanked were self-deprecating. He suggested that he got out of journalism because he wasn't good at it: "If I had been a better reporter, I might have sunk my teeth in.'' In fact, he was by all accounts incredibly dogged, and has an impressive clip file to show for his few years in the business.</p>
        <p>He tells some funny, but highly suspect stories about being a dork campaigner -- like the one about not knowing a thing to say after one of his opponents beat him to the microphone and stole his one joke at a joint appearance during his first race.</p>
        <p>And he goes a little over the top in describing 1988, when he ran for president and lost, a defeat he seems to have found humiliating in the extreme, and come down excessively hard on himself for, given that he ran at only 39. (He says 38.)</p>
        <p>He did tell a couple of self-protective stories, though for no compelling reason: He said his assignment as an Army journalist came as a complete surprise; friends said he'd spent months figuring the surest shot at such a job. He said his ally Mayor Ed  Koch's feud with Jesse Jackson during the New York primary in 1988 caught him off guard; if he didn't know about it, he hadn't been reading the papers. And he followed in the great presidential tradition of exaggerating his churchgoing.</p>
        <p>Some of the stories about his stories are also wrong. He did work hard on his family's farm. He did not claim to have discovered Love Canal. On Imus last week, the Republican consultant Mary Matalin even accused Mr. Gore, inaccurately, of lying about having been at his sister Nancy's deathbed.</p>
        <p>Still, it is no lie that Mr. Gore has a problem, and a problem of his own making. The public seems to accept -- if not to expect -- politicians to sandpaper the facts a bit when presenting their record.</p>
        <p>Not much was made of George W. Bush's misstatement in the most recent debate that all three men tried for the murder of James Byrd, the black man killed in Jasper, Tex., were sentenced to death -- though it seems unlikely that the fact that one got a lesser sentence could have escaped his notice.</p>
        <p>Nobody was puzzled by why Bill Clinton would lie about Monica S. Lewinsky. And even President Ronald Reagan's apocryphal stories about welfare queens driving Cadillacs and Soviets eating sawdust made sense in terms of expressing his worldview.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Gore, on the other hand, we see someone stretching the truth for weird, inscrutable reasons, in ways we don't understand; Is it just to keep his skills up?</p>
        <p>At least until recently, the vice president himself did not seem to believe he had a problem, other than one of press relations. When I asked him what he made of the assessment that he exaggerates, he thought for a moment and said, ''Part of it is the modern -- the hair trigger on the hypocrisy pop gun these days and the politics of biography interacting with that hair-trigger.''</p>
        <p>BUT the explanation that best captures the many stories I've heard Mr. Gore tell came from Mike Kopp, who worked for him for years and says that usually, he embellishes in an effort to connect.</p>
        <p>''When he would talk to the media, he'd embellish his media career to connect with the reporter,'' Mr. Kopp said. ''If you said you'd worked 10 years with The Wall Street Journal, he'd say, 'Oh, I worked nearly 10 years at The Tennessean.' It was 'Hey, I'm one of you.' I don't ever think it was done intentionally to mislead. It was, 'I want to connect with you.' ''</p>
        <p>Of course, a more natural politician might not have to work so much, try so hard or stretch so far, to make those connections. Which is why Mr. Gore's exaggerations might not be so hard to understand after all.</p>
