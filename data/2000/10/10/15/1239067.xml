        <p>Two global flash points, the Middle East and the Balkans, have been in the spotlight in recent weeks for different reasons. Now comes a reminder from Oslo -- in the form of a Nobel Peace Prize -- of encouraging signs in another of the world's most enduring trouble spots. President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea has been awarded the prize for his efforts to secure peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula.</p>
        <p>The 76-year-old Mr. Kim, improbably elected president in 1997, is a worthy recipient. As a dissident during the years of Seoul's military dictatorship, Mr. Kim struggled courageously for human rights and democracy before assuming the presidency. It is only fitting that one of the heroes of democracy's triumph in South Korea is striving to bring lasting peace to the entire peninsula.</p>

        <p>Two global flash points, the Middle East and the Balkans, have been in the spotlight in recent weeks for different reasons. Now comes a reminder from Oslo -- in the form of a Nobel Peace Prize -- of encouraging signs in another of the world's most enduring trouble spots. President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea has been awarded the prize for his efforts to secure peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula.</p>
        <p>The 76-year-old Mr. Kim, improbably elected president in 1997, is a worthy recipient. As a dissident during the years of Seoul's military dictatorship, Mr. Kim struggled courageously for human rights and democracy before assuming the presidency. It is only fitting that one of the heroes of democracy's triumph in South Korea is striving to bring lasting peace to the entire peninsula.</p>
        <p>The award came a day after the United States and North Korea pledged to ''fundamentally improve'' their relations. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced plans to visit President Kim Il Jong of North Korea in Pyongyang soon, and her visit may pave the way for a subsequent visit by the president. Mr. Clinton will embark on a historic trip to Vietnam in November, and a stop in North Korea would give an added flourish to Mr. Clinton's last months in office.</p>
        <p>In its citation to Kim Dae Jung, the Nobel committee alluded to the contributions made by North Korea and other countries to advance reconciliation and possible reunification on the Korean peninsula. President Clinton deserves some of the credit. His administration has adroitly made overtures to North Korea's Communist regime while insisting that it give up efforts to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>At home, President Kim's cultivation of Pyongyang has not always been popular. But this year it has paid impressive dividends. He held the first-ever summit with his North Korean counterpart in June. The two countries have since agreed to rebuild the rail link between them, arranged short family reunions for relatives separated for a half-century and marched together in the opening ceremonies of the Sydney Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>The thaw could not have been possible, to be sure, without a dramatic attitudinal shift on the part of North Korea, which not long ago seemed intent on dragging the peninsula into another war. But serious issues remain to be resolved, such as Pyongyang's program to develop intercontinental missiles. Washington and Seoul must now ascertain whether the thaw is merely an opportunistic gambit by President Kim Il Jong to attract economic aid or a fundamental attempt to overcome the past.</p>
