        <p>DUSK was settling over Chelsea Piers, but at the rear of the huge Manhattan complex where ''The Street'' was recently being videotaped, the light blazed bright as noon.</p>
        <p>Behind the set, in an office-cum- fitting room, Patricia Field stood gazing at Tom Everett Scott. She scoured every inch of the actor, who plays a Wall Street trader on the show, making certain that all the seams of his suit were pressed as flat as tarmac.</p>
        <p>These days, the vermilion-haired designer, who costumes ''Sex and the City,'' has turned her attention to this new series, on Fox, which will have its premiere on Nov. 1. Her mandate, she said, ''is to do for these guys what we did for the women in 'Sex and the City' -- make them look hot.''</p>
        <p>That she does. Ms. Field spends several hectic nights each week in this boudoir-size room, pleading on the phone with vendors, chain-smoking, issuing edicts to Rebecca Field, her co-designer and companion (who has taken Ms. Field's name). When she's not spinning like a dervish, she's dreaming up a suitably sexy persona for each of her stars.</p>
        <p>Ms. Field knows, but has little use for Wall Street's gritty reality -- ''the sweaty, schleppy guys in the middle of the trading floor.'' Instead she opts for a glittering fiction, decking out her characters in snug three-button suits and improbably riveting colors. ''We like to show their flashy side to push your buttons,'' she said. ''We imagine these young, new-money guys living in fabulous apartments and driving great cars.''</p>
        <p>''Sacker would have a Porsche,'' Rebecca Field suggested, referring to a predatory trader played by Rick Hoffman. Patricia Field, turning to Mr. Scott, said: ''Tom, on the other hand, is our Cary Grant. He would drive a BMW.''</p>
        <p>Peering over her red harlequin frames, the designer studied the actor's trousers, dropping to her knees. ''Ooh, Tighty McTighty -- but sexy,'' she crooned, pinching the seams.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Field squealed, ''See, this is how we play dress up.'' Patricia Field tossed her a reproachful look. ''He doesn't just stand there like a mannequin,'' she reprimanded. ''He does get to say yes or no.''</p>
        <p>Patricia Field fetched a formal white cravat for Mr. Scott. ''We tend to go a bit dressy for the show.'' she said. '''He looks like a Kennedy,'' Rebecca Field gushed. Patricia Field beamed, agreeing, ''Here we have a real New York leading man.''</p>
        <p>But such gratifying moments were rare. Patricia Field spent the intervening hours toying with her mink cigarette lighter, a gift from Tokyo, and waiting. It was almost 8 p.m. when the unit publicist poked her head in to say the crew was ready.</p>
        <p>No sooner had she heard that than, with her partner in tow, Patricia Field made a beeline toward the set, a mammoth assemblage of rooms with all the appointments of a Wall Street brokerage firm. She took her place behind the video monitor and watched as Mr. Scott joined two other actors. In a gleaming simulacrum of a corporate kitchen, they  muttered lines and munched on croissants during what was supposed to be a hasty postdawn breakfast.</p>
        <p>''Cut,'' the director intoned at two-minute intervals. Patricia Field sighed. It wasn't long before her attention wandered and she and her partner decamped, heading toward the set's cavernous trading floor. ''Will you look,'' she exclaimed, gesturing to bank after bank of computer screens, each surrounded by fake  family photos and dog-eared issues of Playboy and The Financial Times to give the desk space its own raffishly personal character.</p>
        <p>Similarly atmospheric touches pervaded every corner of the set, from the canvas skyscrapers visible through the conference room windows, to the porcelain urinals in the men's room. So convincing were those that signs had to be taped over them warning, ''Do Not Use.''</p>
        <p>The pair turned and made for the ''elevators.'' Patricia Field looked longingly at their massive steel doors. ''Sometimes you think you can just push the button and one of these will open so you can go home,'' she said. She knew better, of course. Straightening up, she turned on her heel and slouched wearily back toward the fitting room.</p>
