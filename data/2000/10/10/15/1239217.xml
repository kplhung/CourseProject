        <p>Partnership for the Homeless vice president Warren B Scharf, in response to Oct 12 article on Giuliani administration's proposal for rent subsidies for homeless persons, welcomes move but holds it is considered only remedial plan in response to current emergency, and will assist fewer than 10 percent of more than 5,000 families in shelter system; says only long-term solution to housing problem is construction of affordable housing</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Though I am pleased with New York City's decision to start a rent-subsidy program for 500 homeless families (news article, Oct. 12), I must point out that this is considered only a remedial plan in response to the current emergency, and will assist fewer than 10 percent of the more than 5,000 families now languishing in the shelter system. Moreover, it provides no relief to the ''hidden homeless,'' those thousands of families living tenuously, doubled and tripled up in the homes of families and friends.</p>

        <p>Though I am pleased with New York City's decision to start a rent-subsidy program for 500 homeless families (news article, Oct. 12), I must point out that this is considered only a remedial plan in response to the current emergency, and will assist fewer than 10 percent of the more than 5,000 families now languishing in the shelter system. Moreover, it provides no relief to the ''hidden homeless,'' those thousands of families living tenuously, doubled and tripled up in the homes of families and friends.</p>
        <p>The only long-term solution to our housing problem is the construction of affordable housing. Even during the most difficult fiscal period of the 1990's, the city invested much more in affordable housing than it does now. Ultimately, the monetary cost of new housing is small compared with the cost that our continued failure has on the social and economic fabric of the city.</p>
