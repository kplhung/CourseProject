        <p>Block Drug Company, based in Jersey City since 1938, will be sold to the drug company SmithKline Beecham for $1.24 billion. Block Drug, founded in Brooklyn in 1907, produces Sensodyne and Poli-Grip denture adhesive, among other pharmacy items. Block Drug's net income in the previous fiscal year was $56.8 million. London-based SmithKline Beecham, which had $4.1 billion in consumer sales last year,  and makes Nicorette gum and Tums antacids, among many other products, has more 47,000 employees in 160 countries. It is also preparing to merge with Glaxo Wellcome, a pharmaceutical research company. The Block family, which owns about 16 million shares of the Block Drug Company, will receive roughly $848 million for the sale. Block Drug employs about 3,000 people worldwide, 900 of them in New Jersey. Hugh Burns, spokesman for Block Drug, said the company expected the sale to lead to layoffs.  The sale is expected to pass regulatory clearance in the United States and Europe by the end of the year.</p>
