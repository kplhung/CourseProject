        <p>IT was lunchtime on a Tuesday in the kitchen of Samuel and Ann Charters in Storrs, and over a  turkey sandwich, Mr. Charters was discussing rap music, particularly the work of early gangsta rappers like the Geto Boys and the late Tupac Shakur.</p>
        <p>''Never has there been the kind of folk expression in music that rap represents,'' he said. ''There's so much anger being worked off.'' While he doesn't approve of rap's sometimes violent and pornographic imagery, he declares that ''rappers are producing the most complex, inventive rhyme schemes of anyone in pop music today.''</p>

        <p>IT was lunchtime on a Tuesday in the kitchen of Samuel and Ann Charters in Storrs, and over a  turkey sandwich, Mr. Charters was discussing rap music, particularly the work of early gangsta rappers like the Geto Boys and the late Tupac Shakur.</p>
        <p>''Never has there been the kind of folk expression in music that rap represents,'' he said. ''There's so much anger being worked off.'' While he doesn't approve of rap's sometimes violent and pornographic imagery, he declares that ''rappers are producing the most complex, inventive rhyme schemes of anyone in pop music today.''</p>
        <p>Whether you share his views or not, when you talk music with Mr. Charters, 71, you're conversing with one extraordinary fan. In the past 50 years, he has developed a reputation as one of African-American music's most formidable producers, field researchers and historians, along the way earning a Grammy Award (for producing Clifton Chenier's 1983 zydeco album, ''I'm Here''), a Deems Taylor Award for Excellence in Music Writing (for his 1981 book ''The Roots of the Blues''), and induction into the Blues Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>On Friday, he and Ann, 63, an English professor at the University of Connecticut since 1974, will preside over the opening of the Charters Archive at UConn's Thomas J. Dodd Research Center. Drawn largely from the couple's personal collection, the archive incorporates recordings (including gospel, ragtime, rap, jazz, Caribbean and almost every subgenre of the blues), sheet music, books, videos, photos and research materials that date from the mid-19th century to the present.</p>
        <p>''It's arguably the most comprehensive African-American music archive yet compiled in one place,'' said Robert Stevens, a UConn music professor and the interim director of the university's Institute of African-American Studies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Charters's appreciation of music was fostered by his jazz-loving family in Pittsburgh; several relatives were musicians. As a teenager he took up clarinet, but was frustrated by his own limitations. In 1950, he traveled to New Orleans in the hope of improving his technique, and came under the tutelage of legendary clarinetist George Lewis.</p>
        <p>More interested in the personal anecdotes Lewis shared -- about his own life and those of fellow jazz musicians -- than in the notes he played, Mr. Charters said he ''realized that none of the jazz books I had read had ever told me what George was telling me. There was so much more we needed to learn.''</p>
        <p>Much of the blues folklore and history now taken for granted hadn't been recorded at that time. Names like Mississippi John Hurt, Son House and Charley Patton were long forgotten, or yet to be discovered.</p>
        <p>John and Alan Lomax, a Texas-based father-and-son team of ethnomusicologists, had canvassed the deep South in the 1930's and 40's, seeking indigenous folk music on behalf of the Library of Congress. Mr. Charters decided to do similar research into blues music, but his orientation was more biographical.</p>
        <p>''The Lomaxes were simply interested in developing a broad sociological picture of folk music,'' he said. ''I was more interested in finding the great artists who helped to shape and redefine the blues tradition.''</p>
        <p>In the 50's, he first attempted to uncover the story of Robert Johnson, a Mississippi bluesman who was barely known at that time. There was no clue to go on except a song called ''Stones in My Passway,'' recorded in San Antonio.</p>
        <p>''So, I walked the streets there, asking people, 'Did you ever hear of Robert Johnson?' '' Mr. Charters said. ''Of course, he'd only been in town for two weeks' worth of recording sessions. Still, people gave me many wonderful stories, not all of which were true.''</p>
        <p>In time, Mr. Charters's activities shifted from field research to field recording, much of it under the direction of the founder of Folkways Records, Moses Asch. ''I felt if I didn't record them, it might not get done,'' he said. ''But I realized in the mid-1950's that I was pretty much  covering the whole South myself. It was too big; I needed help.''</p>
        <p>His 1959 book ''Country Blues,'' a series of profiles of artists like Blind Lemon Jefferson, Big Bill Broonzy, Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry, was a call to arms. A major inspiration for the widespread blues revival of the 1960's, it's still in print more than 40 years later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Charters may have been the Pied Piper for a whole new generation of blues enthusiasts, but he found his true soul mate in Ann. Married in 1959, the couple had met five years earlier, while taking the same musical counterpoint class at the University of California at Berkeley. He was an economics major, she a gifted pianist (and Connecticut native) who had just decided to major in English. They kept in touch after Mr. Charters graduated in 1956 and embarked on his projects for Folkways.</p>
        <p>''He sent me the first record he produced, 'Looking for Blind Willie  Johnson,' '' Ms. Charters said. By that time the Texas gospel blues legend had died, so the disc consisted of a handful of reissued recordings combined with Mr. Charters's commentary and an interview with Johnson's widow. ''I took it into my little cottage where I had an inexpensive phonograph and just listened, entranced,'' she added. ''The work he was doing blew me away. I thought to myself, 'I could marry him.' ''</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1957 Ms. Charters drove cross-country intent on pursuing a graduate degree at Columbia University and, she joked, ''getting my man,'' who had relocated to New York City. They've collaborated on many projects since, including the 1958 ''A Joplin Bouquet'' -- the first album to record Scott Joplin's rags in traditional style -- and a trip to the Bahamas the same year, to research the African-inspired vernacular music of Andros Island. There, they discovered the guitarist Joseph Spence as well as Ms. Charters's talents with a camera.</p>
        <p>''I'd bought a secondhand Brownie while at Berkeley,'' she said, ''but up to that point I'd never taken anything but pictures of my cat.''</p>
        <p>One day, while Mr. Charters set up his tape recorder, Ms. Charters became fascinated with some handmade fishing sloops nearby. ''I was wearing a dress, so I hitched up my skirt, wandered knee-deep into the water and shot the pic,'' she says. The photo ended up on the cover of the resultant Folkways release, ''Music of the Bahamas,'' and launched her on her avocation as Mr. Charters's field photographer. Her portraits of blues musicians are now included in the UConn archive and spotlighted in the couple's new book,  ''Blues Faces.''</p>
        <p>On her own, Ms. Charters has cultivated a reputation as one of the world's foremost experts on the Beat Generation poets, befriending Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac (she helped him compile a bibliography of his works in 1967) and writing innumerable articles and books, including an acclaimed biography of Kerouac in 1973. ''I fell in love with the Beats the way I fell in love with Robert Johnson,'' she said. ''For a long time, the literary scholars were just trashing them, but to me they seemed to be talking honestly about something archetypally American, and I wanted to champion that.''</p>
        <p>These days, the Charterses are busier than ever. They are currently making appearances to promote ''Blues Faces'' and ''The Day Is So Long, and the Wages So Small,'' an account of their summer on Andros Island. Mr. Charters has just completed a biography of Bebo Valdes, an influential Cuban pianist and bandleader.</p>
        <p>''Bebo's story is of a man who gave up an international career because he fell in love with a young Swedish girl,'' he said. ''Since 1963, he's been living quietly in a Stockholm suburb. But the musicians from the Buena Vista Social Club all  worked with Bebo when he had his big orchestra in Havana.''</p>
        <p>While researching the book in Sweden, Mr. Charters also recorded Mr. Valdes for Gazell Records, a sister label to Mr. Charters's Connecticut-based independent record company of the same name, which specializes in new jazz artists and veterans of the 1960's Greenwich Village folk scene (such as Dave Van Ronk).</p>
        <p>He and Ms. Charters still set aside an hour every day for shared music-listening sessions, which feature everything from Japanese koto music to Indian ragas. ''That's our sacred time,'' Ms. Charters said.</p>
        <p>Though he remains conversant on contemporary popular musicians from Beck to Eminem, Mr. Charters admitted: ''I'm not interested in rock acts per se, because of the compromises made. But if an artist is doing something creative, to expand himself or herself, then I'm always interested. I buy many more records than I should.''</p>
        <p>UConn's Institute of African-American Studies, Thomas J. Dodd Research Center and department of music will commemorate the opening of the Charters Archive with a daylong symposium on Friday culminating in a Jorgensen Auditorium performance by the Mississippi blues guitarist Otis Rush.
