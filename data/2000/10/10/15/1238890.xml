        <p>HOW many cows does it take to produce the nation's supply of milk and dairy products? What about in 1928?</p>
        <p>How many supermarkets were there in New Jersey in 1997?</p>
        <p>For those who might sleep fitfully without the answers to those questions, and thousands more like them, there is the Food Institute in Elmwood Park, a nonprofit trade organization whose sole purpose is to gather information about the food industry.</p>
        <p>''In the food trade industry, there are publications that focus on restaurants or supermarkets or on other parts of the industry,'' Rick Pfaff, president of the institute, said. ''We have it all.''</p>
        <p>For 72 years, the Food Institute has been a source for price trends, consumer and producer price index data, statistics on food sales, restaurant sales, mergers and acquisitions, food safety issues and foreign-market profiles.</p>
        <p>Each year, the Food Institute publishes more than 100 reports and puts out papers on such disparate topics as biotechnology, radiation and online shopping. (Item: New Jersey residents spent $3.17 billion on all types of online purchases in 1997.)</p>
        <p>The Food Institute also posts its information online to its members, and sells it on CD-ROM. But its flagship publication is the weekly 24-page ''Food Institute Report,'' which includes news gathered from industry executives, government reports, daily newspapers, international studies and 400 food industry publications like ''Turkey World Magazine,'' ''Spudman'' and ''Hogs and Pigs.'' (Item: In 1998, people in the Western United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, spent less money on pork products than people in other regions.)</p>
        <p>The Food Institute, which accepts no advertising, receives its revenue from about 2,000 members in 40 countries, among them the French and German Embassies, the New Zealand Trade Board, A&amp;P, Procter &amp; Gamble, the Department of Agriculture, the International Trade Commission, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, McDonald's, Asgrow Vegetable Seeds of Galesburg, Mich., and Ducktrap River Fish Farm in Belfast, Me.</p>
        <p>For members, perks abound, like getting answers to such questions as: how many filberts are grown in Turkey? (700,000 metric tons); how much salmon is caught in Alaska? (150 million fish); how much tomato paste is produced in Italy? (335,000 metric tons); and what is the status of the 100 percent tariff on French mustard? (still in effect).</p>
        <p>Recently, Mexico wanted to know if it was on the federal government's list of countries from which American companies could buy shrimp. The answer: To be on that list, foreign countries had to insure that their shrimp boats were fitted with ''turtle-excluder'' devices -- which make sounds that turtles do not like and therefore paddle away from before getting caught in shrimp nets. (Mexico was on the approved list).</p>
        <p>One situation that local growers are following in the institute's report is the Department of Agriculture's limit on the volume of cranberries that can be marketed during the 2000-2001 crop year. The cap was imposed because consumer demand for cranberries -- coupled with soaring production -- leveled off. New Jersey produced 521,000 barrels in 1998, as against Wisconsin, which led the nation in production with 2,540,000 barrels, reported the ''Food Market in Review,'' another of the institute's publications.</p>
        <p>''They're very good at condensing information and knowing what their readers want to track,'' said Dean Pappas, the chief executive of Clement Pappas &amp; Company in Seabrook, which makes juices and cranberry sauces and supplies the products to supermarkets for use as private labels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pappas, who has been reading the report for 35 years, added, ''I always look at the commodity reports on the fruit concentrates that my company purchases.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, Tim McCarty, a food analyst for the International Trade Commission, said he looked for news about retail sales as well as fresh and processed vegetables.</p>
        <p>''That publication is fantastic,'' said Mr. McCarty. ''I just find it extremely helpful in what I do.''</p>
        <p>One success story of the decade that the institute has been reporting on is applesauce. ''It's not glamorous,'' Jim Gawley, the institute's vice president for publishing, admitted in a burst of overstatement. ''But you used to think of applesauce as coming in the 32-ounce jar. Now, we're seeing when we look at supermarket sales trends, it's the individual pack you can put in a child's lunch box that commands the highest share of sales at the supermarket.''</p>
        <p>Another big story has been the consolidation of the food industry, said Brian L. Todd, the institute's senior vice president. ''The larger companies are buying smaller companies,'' Mr. Todd said, ''and the larger companies are spinning off other companies, like Unilever purchasing Bestfoods.''</p>
        <p>The year 1998 was a record year for mergers and acquisitions in the food industry, said Mr. Pfaff, the institute's president, and the trend is continuing. ''I've been here going on 29 years,'' he said. ''At that time, there was such a host of companies to talk to, numerous small processors, buyers, brokers and what not. Consolidation in this industry has been significant. It used to be that there were maybe 50 canning companies and now there are half a dozen.''</p>
        <p>Keeping up with developments can be challenging, said members of the institute staff, considering all the new food products. For instance, 17,977 new products were introduced in 1998, and 16,544 last year (including iceberg water and New Age beverages with different herbs for changing one's aura). Beef jerky is big this year.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there are some things that stay about the same, milk and spinach consumption, for example.</p>
        <p>When not behind their desks here, the analysts sometimes get a chance to go out into the field, so to speak, and get close to the world on which they report.</p>
        <p>One analyst, Jim Gawley, recalled going to Washington State and being amazed by the ''sheer volume of peas and corn.''</p>
        <p>''I saw cornfields as far as the eye could see,'' Mr. Gawley said, ''and those big tractors, harvesters that work like lawn mowers, going throughout the fields taking the corn off the plants, propelling them through a large shoot into a dump truck riding alongside of it, coming back to the plant, where the corn is shucked off by a machine, and removing the kernels into poly bags that go to the supermarket; and the trucks kept coming and going.''</p>
        <p>But most days in the life of a food-news gatherer pass more prosaically, they say. Free samples are scarce. There was some beef jerky in the office refrigerator the other day that someone had sent them to munch on between phone calls and the unending reading of reports. (Meat snack sales in the United States totaled about $850 million in 1998.)</p>
        <p>And it can be noted, it takes 9.2 million cows to produce the nation's milk supply these days, as against a million cows in 1928.</p>
        <p>And attention, shoppers, there were 2,402 supermarkets in New Jersey in 1977. It was a very good year.</p>
