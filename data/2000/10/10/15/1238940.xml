        <p>IF there is nothing new under the sun, as philosophers say, don't tell the eight members of the Boonton-based roots rock band Swampadelica. It might make them feel like switching occupations, and, judging by their debut self-produced album, also called ''Swampadelica,'' that would be a loss.</p>
        <p>Swampadelica's rich gumbo of sounds comes from so many different influences that is difficult to describe. But the one thing that can be said for the group, which appears at clubs from Boston to Washington, D.C., is that it swings.</p>
        <p>The Swampadelica sound is not rock 'n' roll, jazz or blues, but lies somewhere in between with large doses of New Orleans swamp and zydeco and hints of psychedelic, hip-hop and even classical thrown in.</p>
        <p>''Our influences are everything from Bach to James Brown,'' said Damian Calcagne, a founding member and one of the two lead singers and writers in the group. ''That's not your usual B's you think of when you think of music, but it is part of where we come from.''</p>
        <p>Some of the music's eclectic mix derives from the diverse musical backgrounds of the members of the band, which practices in and sometimes performs concerts in a barn in Vernon Township.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calcagne, originally from Denville, honed his talents on keyboards in a Grateful Dead-style band known as Old Joe Bones and has played with the New Jersey jam band From Good Homes. The other founding member and lead singer, Stevo Nelson, originally from Livingston, was steeped in the music of New Orleans when he was a doorman at the Crescent City club Tipitina for seven years.</p>
        <p>In those years he sat in with numerous swamp music and blues groups that came through the club and acquired his first rubboard or percussion board. He soon had a friend adapt the board by adding racks of bells, symbols and plastic blocks, which he plays with a fork wrapped in duct tape.</p>
        <p>The two started writing music on the computer in Mr. Calcagne's basement, dubbing in many of the different parts before recruiting Bill Miller, a jazz-schooled drummer, and Paul Kuzik, a classically trained bassist.</p>
        <p>An additional touch of New Orleans was added when white-haired Snowman Brian Powers, a Louisiana-bred saxophonist, joined the group. A new guitarist, Brian Herkert of Boonton, rounds out the players in the band.</p>
        <p>But the musicians still felt something was missing until they recruited two women, Nicole Grana and Kerri Lavin, to spice up the vocals.</p>
        <p>The band takes its direction from the two founders. ''But everyone in the band is a really strong player and sooner or later everyone's influence gets infused into the mix,'' Mr. Nelson said. The band members have encountered a lot of good luck in recent months, which has brought attention to the fast-paced, blues-based mix of songs they play. Several of the band's numbers, including ''Hoo Doo,'' the story of trouble found on the gritty streets of New Orleans, have been featured on MTV's ''The Real World.''</p>
        <p>The group also helped re-open the Stone Pony in Asbury Park on Memorial Day weekend and has played at the Wetlands in New York City.</p>
        <p>All the members, with the exception of Ms. Lavin, who lives in New York City, live in northern New Jersey. Mr. Herkert and Mr. Powers have even moved their families to Mr. Calcagne's street in Booton.</p>
        <p>Although they started in a basement and practice in a barn, this is no garage band of young kids. The age range in the group is early 20's to mid-30's for the two founders, who declined to be more specific. All of the men in the group are married, with seven children among them.</p>
        <p>The band hooked up with the engineer John Siket, who has worked with Phish, the Dave Matthews Band and Sonic Youth. Hearing a tape of the band's songs Mr. Siket liked the sound so much he agreed to help make the debut album. The band has at least three more albums worth of material ready to record, but is not overly eager to sign with a record company.</p>
        <p>''There is a fine balance between the business side and the music,'' Mr. Calcagne said. ''We don't want to lose creative control so we are just focusing on the music trying to say something that has not been said.''</p>
        <p>The band is developing a following on the club circuit.</p>
        <p>''Once people hear us,'' Mr. Calcagne said, ''if they like us, there is nowhere else they can go for our sound.''</p>
