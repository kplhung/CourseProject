        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a 26-year resident of Rockland County, I was surprised to read the article ''Fight Over Fire Siren in Thornwood'' [Sept. 3]. The whole situation sounds like the town officials are marching backward in time to the horse-and-buggy days.</p>
        <p>Here in Clarkstown the fire sirens are placed on the firehouse only. I can't imagine how any moms in Thornwood get their kids to take a nap with that blast occurring every noon. I guess the fire chief and the mayor expect the moms and their kids to work around the chief's schedule. Here electronic pagers are used as the primary way to alert the volunteers.</p>
        <p>I had several of our guys tell me that they would never hear the siren if they were working or sitting inside their home.</p>
        <p>I can't get over that Thornwood already spent the money on pagers but the chief thinks it's inconvenient to wear them. How did he sell the town board on paying for those things in the first place? He appears to be more concerned about his family than the residents he volunteered to help.</p>
