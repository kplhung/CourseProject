        <p>Plaid isn't just for trench coat linings anymore. After last year's craze for Burberry plaid, the fashion world is finding ways to tweak the tartan. This season, using whimsical materials like leather and fur, and processes like tie-dyeing and silk-screening, designers are exploding the pattern of decorum. Even Burberry breaks out of the traditional grid -- as witnessed by its new monochrome jacquard plaid ties and bold plaid high-heel boots. To be sure, too much of a good thing can cause ganglion overload: Don't try these combos outside your home.</p>
        <p>A mod granddad sweater, near right, by Dirk Schonberger ($315 at Barneys New York) and micro-plaid trousers by Fink ($54 at Urban Outfitters) are topped off by a water-resistant fishing hat by Prada ($232) -- perfect for catching, er, striped bass? At far right, Daryl K's crazy-quilt wool circle skirt ($545) plays counterpoint to a diagonally pitched Banana Republic handbag ($95), and a floppy mohair Fred Bare hat ($210).</p>
