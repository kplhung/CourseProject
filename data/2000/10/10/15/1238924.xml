        <p>WHEN the Haddonfield Memorial High School track team arrives at another school, you hear the whispers. Which one is Erin Donohue? There she is; it's Erin Donohue.</p>
        <p>At age 17, Erin, a senior, has become a sports celebrity in the state. She has run the mile in 4:48, the third-fastest time ever for a high school girl in New Jersey -- and the best time in the state among current runners.</p>
        <p>Last spring, she came in third at the national Foot Locker championships in North Carolina. This year, Gatorade named her New Jersey track athlete of the year. And if that is not enough, she is also a top cross-country runner and can hurl the javelin almost 150 feet. And for the past three years, no one in New Jersey has beaten her in the 800, 1,600 or 3,200 meters.</p>
        <p>''Once in every 15 or 20 years you see an athlete like Erin,'' said Phil Smart, the athletic director at Haddonfield High. ''She has faith and determination. She just wills herself to win. Her tremendous will separates her from other athletes.''</p>
        <p>It is for those reasons that the Division I colleges have already come knocking at her door with scholarship offers. In fact, she has received so many recruiting letters in the past year and a half that her mother, Eva, recently moved a large box of letters into the basement because they were taking up too much space in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>She is that student the colleges are looking for: a top athlete and member of the National Honor Society and with a combined total on her College Boards of 1370.</p>
        <p>More than 200 schools contacted her about basketball and track, but she decided to stick with track and not play basketball in her senior year of high school or in college. For now, running is her focus, and she is running better than ever.</p>
        <p>Coaches from other schools know Erin, and recognize that she is likely to be a top college runner and perhaps an Olympic contender some day.</p>
        <p>''She's not built like the typical distance runner, and her form isn't the greatest,'' said Robert Kiessling, who coaches girls' track and cross-country at Bishop Eustace Prep in Pennsauken and ran track in high school with Erin's father, Ed, ''but she always gets the job done and has tremendous speed. People think that it all comes naturally, but she works very hard.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiessling should recognize a thoroughbred when he sees one. In the early 1980's he coached another high school star, Michelle Rowen, who still holds the state's 3,200-meter record, and he said he saw similarities in how hard both girls worked at their sport and ''in their approach to training.''</p>
        <p>While many high school runners are stick-thin, Erin, at 5 feet 7 1/2 inches, weighs 140 pounds. She is muscular, with the kind of athletic look often found in female Olympians: ruddy cheeks, white teeth, a dark blond ponytail.</p>
        <p>At home, her bedroom bookshelves are lined with medals and trophies, and a poster of Michael Jordan looms above her bed. The art is all sports stars, but no rockers or rappers. Growing up in a middle-class home with two younger brothers, she is a big sports fan. She attends her high school football games and wants to go to a college with great sports teams so that she can enjoy being a spectator as well as a player. For now, she is looking at several schools in the East, including the University of North Carolina and Penn State.</p>
        <p>Ed and Eva Donohue can't think of a time when their daughter wasn't running. By the age of 3, they say, she was running around the block.</p>
        <p>As Erin puts it, ''It seems like I've always been running.''</p>
        <p>Her father ran track in high school, and still runs regularly -- including the Boston Marathon -- and in the evenings with his daughter. He laughs about the time he was running with Erin, who was 4 or 5 at the time, and she tripped and fell. He turned around to pick her up, but ''she just brushed herself right off and kept on running,'' he said. ''She's got a lot of heart.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Donohue stopped running with Erin when her daughter was 5. As her mother tells it, one day they went out for a half-mile run, and she found herself way behind and wheezing. ''Erin stopped and said, 'Are you alright, Mommy?' '' Now Mrs. Donohue jogs by herself.</p>
        <p>Erin grew up playing soccer and basketball, but knew early on that she was not just an average runner. In the sixth grade, when she ran in a 5K race to raise money for a local symphony, she ended up beating all the high school students running and almost won the women's race. In the seventh grade, her father took her to a competition in Philadelphia, where she ran a mile while dribbling a basketball in 5 minutes and 40 seconds. Not long afterward, coaches around South Jersey and people in the running community began hearing about ''the kid who runs fast,'' her father said.</p>
        <p>In middle school, Erin joined the track team and started winning. Running became ''her main hobby,'' she said, and today her parents, her grandmother and her grandmother's boyfriend are her biggest supporters and fans.</p>
        <p>''They've been very instrumental,'' she said of her parents. ''I don't know if I'd have started running without them.''</p>
        <p>As a freshman at Haddonfield High, she decided to start throwing the javelin, and today she is rated as one of the top 20 female high school throwers in the country.</p>
        <p>''I just picked it up and threw it, and it was half-decent,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Nick Baker, who coaches the boy's team at Haddonfield, and his wife, Maureen, who coaches the girls, say it is the combination of natural ability and hard work that account for Erin's success. She runs all summer, and by the summer's end she is running 90 miles a week.</p>
        <p>''She trains very hard, and she has a ton of energy,'' said Mr. Baker, noting that Erin usually works out with the boy's team. ''She is powerful, strong and aggressive, not a textbook runner at all. She's not gliding. She pumps her arms and twists her body. I've never met anyone with her energy. I wish I could bottle it and take it in the morning.''</p>
        <p>She works out three or four times a week on a stationary bike, and does leg exercises as well as 200 sit-ups. She is also the clown who gets the team laughing before the meets and keeps everyone loose.</p>
        <p>''Her humor takes her a long way,'' said Michael Busarello, the school's cross country coach. ''She's been the core of the team for three years. Even if she wasn't such a winner, she'd still be the core of the team.''</p>
        <p>She breaks the tension before the races, said a teammate, Mary Mulholland, 17, who  with Erin and Meredith McDonald is co-captain of the team.</p>
        <p>''She's a good leader and a fun person to be with,'' Mary said. ''She brings more attention to the team and we're proud of her.''</p>
        <p>Over the past three years, Erin has become used to that attention. Phyllis St. Onge, a Haddonfield parent, said she clipped articles about Erin that appear in the local newspapers and puts them on her refrigerator. One day, Mrs. St. Onge, pulled over on Kings Highway, the main street here, opened her window and said, ''Erin, you are a magnificent athlete and you make the basketball games so exciting.''</p>
        <p>At a recent track meet, Mrs. St. Onge said she was impressed when Erin stayed to watch the middle school runners and stood in the front of the crowd cheering them on. ''We just think she's the best and she's very humble,' she said.</p>
        <p>Erin does find time to attend school dances and plays as well as sporting events, but she admits that her focus on running has called for sacrifices. For instance, she said  she did not participate in any activity that might slow her down.</p>
        <p>''You want to go out with friends, but if you have to go to a meet the next day, you don't go,'' she said. ''But it's been worth it.''</p>
        <p>College -- as with all youths -- will be a big change for Erin. For one thing, she won't always be running ahead of the pack.</p>
        <p>''She'll probably do pretty well,'' said Mr. Kiessling. ''She's not going to dominate in the beginning, but if she's willing to live and learn, she's going to do well. She's very mature. If she handles the pressure the right way -- and I think she will -- she'll be near the top.''</p>
