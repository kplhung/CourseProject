        <p>THEATER is stressful,'' says Neil Simon. The winner of the Pulitzer Prize and four Tony Awards is back in New York for his 31st play, ''The Dinner Party.'' But getting to the city wasn't easy.

        <p>''So many times when I do a play I wind up having a physical problem,'' said Mr. Simon, 73, sitting in the living room of his Park Avenue apartment recently and looking somewhat thin.

        <p>THEATER is stressful,'' says Neil Simon. The winner of the Pulitzer Prize and four Tony Awards is back in New York for his 31st play, ''The Dinner Party.'' But getting to the city wasn't easy. He had planned to arrive from his home on the West Coast on Sept. 15 for the start of rehearsals, but found himself laid up with a stomach ailment that refused to go away.</p>
        <p>''So many times when I do a play I wind up having a physical problem,'' said Mr. Simon, 73, sitting in the living room of his Park Avenue apartment recently and looking somewhat thin. ''I made a list the other day, and I thought of 11 of them -- all over my body, in so many different places. But I know there are others I haven't remembered.''</p>
        <p>When he was doing ''Broadway Bound'' in Washington in 1986, he said, he thought he was having a heart attack on opening night -- ''I wasn't, but it felt like it'' -- and he had to be taken to a hospital. ''When 'Jake's Women' was first done in San Diego,'' he said, ''I bent down and my back went out and I had to go the hospital. When 'The Dinner Party' was in Los Angeles, I had a 10-day headache. The mind does this for you.''</p>
        <p>His friends ask him why he still feels such stress, since he has written so many hit plays and the success or failure of the latest one is not going to change his life. ''But it has nothing to do with that,'' he said. ''It has to do with the work, and wanting the work to be good, wanting to make it the best I can make it.''</p>
        <p>The symptoms of physical distress don't occur during the actual writing and rewriting, he said, they happen before or after. And they don't show up when he is working on a movie. ''The difference,'' he noted, ''is that a movie isn't opening in one city, in one theater, with a handful of critics, and it's not being judged the night the critics come.''</p>
        <p>''The Dinner Party'' opens on Thursday at the Music Box Theater, after an earlier run in Los Angeles and a critically praised sold-out month in Washington. Its subject is marriage and divorce. The cast -- Len Cariou, Veanne Cox, Penny Fuller, Jan Maxwell, John Ritter and Henry Winkler -- is directed by John Rando.</p>
        <p>Set in an exclusive Paris restaurant, the play is little more than an hour and a half long and is performed without an intermission. Three French men, recipients of a mysterious invitation, arrive at the restaurant, not knowing for sure why they are there. Gradually, the three other guests -- their former wives -- also arrive, and what has started out as a seemingly classic French farce is transformed into an often serious look, with a leavening of humor, at the sadnesses and despairs of marital bliss turned cold. It is Mr. Simon's take on why couples break up, on why even loving and caring mates can sometimes be heartlessly cruel to each other.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the audiences that saw the play in Los Angeles and Washington, Mr. Simon said: ''There's a vicarious thing that happens to them. They're viewing something that may have gone on in their own lives and are very happy to let other people be the spokesmen for what their feelings are.''</p>
        <p>The three couples have been divorced four times -- one couple married twice and divorced twice. Mr. Simon himself has been married five times to four women. His first wife, Joan Baim, died of cancer in 1973. He subsequently wed three actresses: Marsha Mason, then Diane Lander (twice), and ultimately Elaine Joyce, his current wife.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Simon takes great pains to distance himself personally from his play. ''It's very important for me to delineate that the play is not about me,'' he said, ''nor are there references to any of the marriages.''</p>
        <p>''The Dinner Party,'' he explained, was conceived two years ago, at a house he had rented in East Hampton on Long Island: ''I was out there alone, and the theme of divorce came to me, because it has been so prevalent in my own life, and in the lives of my friends. But I truthfully never thought about any of my own marriages, or my own feelings about them. I tried to deal with these characters purely as characters I was writing about.''</p>
        <p>That was one reason he set the play in Paris -- ''to make it far away from the problems we have here.''</p>
        <p>''Maybe I was also influenced by French films,'' he added, ''because the French are very much more open about personal things than we are. But what I tried to do was to make it universal.''</p>
        <p>In attempting to create a ''bonfire, a clash between these people, of why they got divorced, and how they feel about each other,'' he was also trying to write a play very different from anything he had done before.</p>
        <p>''There's something for me that's a little abstract about the play,'' he said, ''certainly compared to my other plays. I had the concept of creating a farce up to a certain point, and then instead of continuing the farce, to make a turn to where it becomes quite serious. I wanted to break the concept that farces can never get real, even for a minute.''</p>
        <p>The play is also unusual for Mr. Simon because of its short length and lack of intermission. ''I couldn't find a place to break it,'' he said. ''And I didn't see it as a long play. I also think that today's audiences are not as patient as they used to be. Most of my plays have run two and a half hours or so. But when we did the revival of 'The Sunshine Boys' with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, we cut about 20 or 25 minutes, and it was much better. So I found that one can be more concise with things, rather than go on and on.''</p>
        <p>Does the bleakness in the play reflect his feelings about marriage? ''In any marriage that breaks up, there's bleakness,'' Mr. Simon said. Even in the best of marriages, people can be cruel to each other. ''But you can't leave out the other half, the wonderful things people say to each other. I try to cover both.</p>
        <p>''At times all of us who are married say, 'Why am I in this thing? Why did I do this?' Who's to say that because you get married, every day is a wonderful day? It's not.''</p>
        <p>Not many people are lucky enough to get the partners they would like to have, he said, ''and so they settle.''</p>
        <p>''If you marry the right person, a person you can work things out with, who's loving and giving and sharing, you're very lucky,'' he said. ''I only expected to be married once in my life. Joan died, and I was thrust into a whole other life.''</p>
        <p>Even his first marriage wasn't perfect, he said, though he may have idealized it in his autobiographies, ''Rewrites'' and ''The Play Goes On.''  ''We had our ups and downs,'' he recalled. ''But it was a true marriage in that we married for the right reasons. We fell in love. I was not Neil Simon then; just a kid scraping to make a few dollars. We married because we loved each other. That's not to say that that didn't happen in the other marriages.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, he does not want to talk about the other marriages -- it's too personal. ''I'm married now,'' he said. ''I'm very happy. I don't like the idea of being married four or five times. But that's what happened. I guess I could have gone the other way and said, after the last divorce, 'That's it, I'm not going to do it any more.' But I'm kind of an optimist.''</p>
        <p>It would seem the case in his professional life as well. Mr. Simon has been writing for the Broadway theater for almost 40 years now, since ''Come Blow Your Horn'' in 1961, and so far, despite the stress, he has shown no signs of letting up. ''It's what I do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Over the last four decades, Mr. Simon has had many successes, among them ''Barefoot in the Park'' and ''The Odd Couple'' in the 60's, ''The Sunshine Boys'' and ''Chapter Two'' in the 70's, and ''Brighton Beach Memoirs,''  ''Biloxi Blues'' and ''Broadway Bound'' in the 80's. In 1991, he won the Pulitzer Prize for ''Lost in Yonkers.''</p>
        <p>But he has also had his share of flops. And he has not had a major hit in the last nine years. In 1995, after the failures on Broadway of the musical ''The Goodbye Girl'' and ''Laughter on the 23rd Floor'' -- that play wound up losing about $800,000 -- Mr. Simon and Emanuel Azenberg, his producer, announced with some fanfare that the next play, ''London Suite,'' would be presented Off Broadway. Because of the high costs, it was not economically viable to go to Broadway anymore, the two men said, pointing out at the time that the play would cost $1.6 million to produce on Broadway compared with $660,000 Off Broadway.</p>
        <p>BUT ''London Suite'' failed -- Mr. Simon said that in retrospect the reason they didn't take it to Broadway was that deep inside they knew it wasn't good enough -- and Mr. Azenberg and Mr. Simon were Broadway bound again in 1997 with Mr. Simon's 30th play, ''Proposals,'' even though they said the economics had in fact become worse. But ''Proposals'' was also a flop. And now, three years later, they are back again.</p>
        <p>''We were very careful with 'The Dinner Party,' '' said Mr. Azenberg, who has been producing Mr. Simon's plays since 1972. ''When it opened at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, we didn't think it was right for Broadway. But we've got to give the Mark Taper people credit. They brought it into the Kennedy Center in Washington. There were cast changes that suddenly caused a change in the play and a change in the reviews.'' The economics are ''still crazy,'' he said, ''but this is where Neil is comfortable. And there was a time when Neil Simon and Broadway were synonymous.''</p>
        <p>Because the set already existed, the play is capitalized at $1.2 million instead of the expected $1.7 million or $1.8 million, Mr. Azenberg said. Part of it, he said -- ''not a minor amount'' -- is Mr. Simon's own money. ''He always backs his own stuff, win or lose,'' Mr. Azenberg said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon said the recent spate of failures does not concern him. ''I love the sitting down and the writing,'' he said. ''I read this in a book about Edward Albee, and it amazed me because it's so much the way I think. He said, 'Oh, I've got an idea for a play -- I'm set for the year.' I have those feelings, too.''</p>
        <p>And besides, he said: ''I've had more hits than I ever thought I would have. I don't expect to win five Pulitzer Prizes. One is enough.''</p>
