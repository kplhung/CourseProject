        <p>The Henry Street II Day Care Center has served families in the Loisaida section of the East Village for three decades. But the city-run center, at 710 East Ninth Street, may have to close because of a rent increase.</p>
        <p>In August, the Eastside Corporation, which owns the building, sued to evict the center after the city, whose lease had expired, rejected a three-fold rent increase. Under the old lease, the city paid less than $23,000 a month. The landlord was seeking $68,000 a month, plus taxes and utilities.</p>
        <p>''This was a move to vacate the building and convert it into luxury housing,'' said Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who represents the increasingly gentrified area. ''If people lose their day care, that means they have to leave their jobs.''</p>
        <p>Margaret Dunn, a single mother who works part time as a social worker and sends her 4-year-old daughter there, agreed.</p>
        <p>''It's the only day care in the area with good facilities,'' Ms. Dunn said.</p>
        <p>Last month, Ms. Dunn and other parents held a protest at the landlord's office to try to save the center.</p>
        <p>The center offers full-time and after-school care and serves about 180 children 2 to 11 years old. It is operated by the city's Administration for Children's Services. Fees are on a sliding scale, depending on parents' income. There is a long waiting list.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Roth, a lawyer for the Eastside Corporation, said his client had no intention of evicting the center, but felt it was ''entitled to rent at market rate.''</p>
        <p>The Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which handles municipal contracts, is negotiating ''a deal in concept for a 20-year renewal,'' said Denise Collins, a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Roth, who noted that the center is operating without a lease, said, ''The city and the landlord are kind of far apart.''</p>
