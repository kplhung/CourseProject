        <p>Plaid isn't just for trench coat linings anymore. After last year's craze for Burberry plaid, the fashion world is finding ways to tweak the tartan. This season, using whimsical materials like leather and fur, and processes like tie-dyeing and silk-screening, designers are exploding the pattern of decorum. Even Burberry breaks out of the traditional grid -- as witnessed by its new monochrome jacquard plaid ties and bold plaid high-heel boots. To be sure, too much of a good thing can cause ganglion overload: Don't try these combos outside your home.</p>
        <p>The clans of Stewart and Gordon meet the house of Elton John in this two-toned suit by Tommy Hilfiger ($950). White leather jacket with red plaid lining and collar can be bought separately ($2,195).</p>
