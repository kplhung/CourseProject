        <p>GOING to the waterfront in Jersey City is a bit like going to Disneyland. On the shores of the Hudson River, the tall buildings are all new, their lawns perfectly trimmed.

        <p>GOING to the waterfront in Jersey City is a bit like going to Disneyland. On the shores of the Hudson River, the tall buildings are all new, their lawns perfectly trimmed. Glistening and clean, the towers sit across from the old land of Manhattan in the new land of -- well, the new land that is five minutes away from Wall Street on the ferry. Call it, maybe, Ferryland.</p>
        <p>Richard Williams and Michiko Murase live in an apartment on the 10th floor of the Portofino, at 1 Second Street in Jersey City, overlooking the Hudson. From the terrace of their apartment, they have a view directly east to the World Trade Center and the World Financial Center, and north to landmarks like the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Apartments in the 283-unit, 26-story building went on the market in April.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, who is English, previously lived in Hong Kong, where he was employed an international insurance company, and where he met Ms. Murase, who is from Japan and was working for a trading company. When he moved here a year and a half  ago to work in his company's New York office, his company helped set him up in Trump Place on the West Side near the Hudson in the upper 60's.</p>
        <p>He didn't mind the apartment, which did not have a river view, but the commute by subway to his downtown office was often  arduous, he said, with huge crowds and, in the summer, no air-conditioning during the wait for a train. ''It would be 110 degrees on the platform,'' he said. ''There were stories about someone pushing people. And you don't always get on.'' When he knew that Ms. Murase would be joining him, he wanted to find a new place.</p>
        <p>''Everybody told me that if you don't live in Manhattan, you're missing the point,'' he said. But they don't seem like two people who are missing the point of anything. In July, they moved into a large two-bedroom apartment in a building with a gym and an outdoor swimming pool, closer to his work than the West Side was. The rent was $2,610 a month, half what it would be five minutes away on the Manhattan side of the river.</p>
        <p>They found the apartment one day by taking the PATH train to Jersey City and walking south. They saw the phone number on the side of the building, and called. ''I just wanted to live on the riverside,'' said Ms. Murase, who married Mr. Williams in a civil ceremony last January at City Hall in Manhattan, and in a religious one last summer in Devon, England.</p>
        <p>THEY keep their car in the building's garage for $150 more a month, so they can make quick getaways for hiking trips to places like Bear Mountain and the Delaware Water Gap. But they are also close to Liberty Park, a large and often nearly empty oasis on the river that has a six-mile running path.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong, Ms. Murase and Mr. Williams met when they were on the same team in an international social and running club called the Hash House Harriers. ''The saying is,'' Mr. Williams explained, ''that it's for drinkers with a running problem.'' They still run, but not consistently. ''We go through phases,'' he said. ''We're in the relaxing phase.''</p>
        <p>Moving to New Jersey has not cut them off from Manhattan; they still go out in the city, especially to Japanese restaurants. But Ms. Murase said that for her, New Jersey is better in many ways, particularly because she has not yet received a work visa. ''It's more relaxed, and there are a lot of housewives,'' she said. ''In Manhattan, everybody is working.''</p>
        <p>She has even met other Japanese women in her building. ''All the Japanese wives cannot work,'' she said. ''We go shopping.''</p>
