        <p>THIS former mill town, known for attracting day-trippers who like to stroll its quaint main street, filled with antique stores and sidewalk cafes, is not normally associated with million-dollar condominiums with concierge service and fitness clubs.</p>
        <p>But on Piermont Landing, a 35-acre peninsula that juts into the Hudson River, an 83-unit development is now being completed that replicates a full-service ''white-glove building,'' its developer said, ''the kind you find in Manhattan.'' And it is attracting a wide assortment of buyers, from young single professionals to empty nesters.</p>
        <p>Called Paradise Harbor, it is a reuse of an old industrial building once used to produce paperboard packaging. Now its industrial columns and high ceilings are features in one- to three-bedroom units, starting at $288,000 and rising to $1.3 million for the two-story penthouses.</p>
        <p>''This is definitely the high end for Piermont,'' said James Collins, a sales associate for Coldwell Banker. ''There's nothing else like this. People are coming for the magnificent views and the lifestyle of Piermont itself.''</p>
        <p>Since sales opened 18 months ago, 70 percent of the units have been sold, Mr. Collins said. ''The buyers are coming from the tristate area and are pretty well distributed across age ranges,'' he said, ''but this is not a place that's particularly attractive for young couples with children. They're the only group not represented. But we have single parents with young kids. And older people who have sold the family home. Some use it as a second home.''</p>
        <p>Paradise Harbor is part of Piermont Landing, a former industrial pier that was transformed during the 1990's into a commercial and residential development. It now has a popular commercial strip with restaurants, art galleries, ice cream shops and cafes and more than 200 town houses.</p>
        <p>Scott Rivers, 27, a pharmaceutical products manager, recently relocated from Dallas and, after looking in Manhattan, opted for a one-bedroom apartment in Paradise Harbor. ''My price range was between $250,000 to $350,000,'' Mr. Rivers said, ''and what I looked at for that price in Manhattan could only be described as dumps. Then a friend told me about Piermont, and the difference was incredible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivers's apartment looks out over the 1,000-acre Piermont Marsh in Tallman Mountain State Park, which borders the pier. ''I'm not right on the water, '' Mr. Rivers said, ''but I can still see it. It's hard to miss it here, no matter where you live.''</p>
        <p>Paradise Harbor is unusual in waterfront projects in that it is within a few feet of the edge of the Hudson River. Its proximity was ''grandfathered'' in since it is a reuse of an industrial building that was constructed before current setback regulations went into effect. ''We never would have been able to build so close to the water today,'' Robert Adamo, the developer, said.</p>
        <p>He added that the cost of recreating a totally concrete building the size of the current structure would have been prohibitive. ''There's never going to be another building like this one -- so close to the water,'' Mr. Adamo said.</p>
        <p>Reconfiguring a three-story factory measuring 120 feet by 340 feet into a residence created many challenges, said Martin Santini, president of Ecoplan of Englewood, N.J., which is designing the project. ''We added one floor in between existing floors,'' Mr. Santini said, ''and one and a half floors on top'' to house the penthouse apartments.</p>
        <p>There were two-foot-diameter columns throughout the structure, some of which were incorporated into the housing units. ''We tried as best we could to keep the original features,'' Mr. Santini said, ''but it wasn't always possible.'' There are 33 different floor plans, he added. And some of the units have angled walls and ceiling heights ranging from 8 to 11 feet.</p>
        <p>T HIS building is overbuilt for a residence,'' Mr. Santini said, explaining that one day workers found a sign indicating that the live load capacity of the floors is 200 pounds per square foot. He added, ''That's way more than what's required for a residential development, which is usually about 80 per square foot.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, because the building is open to the river, the developer decided to reinforce it with steel and install windows able to withstand high-velocity winds. ''One time, we were up on scaffolding on top of the building,'' Mr. Adamo said, ''and I thought we were going to be blown off. The winds were incredible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adamo said he modeled the project after Manhattan's full-service buildings. ''Our buyers could buy anywhere,'' Mr. Adamo said. ''They're coming from all over the tristate area, and we had to offer them more than just a beautiful place to live.''</p>
        <p>There is a concierge on duty from 6 a.m. to midnight every day who can arrange for housekeeping services, takeout food, dry cleaning and wake-up calls, among other services. There are also three tennis courts, an indoor heated swimming pool and a fitness club.</p>
        <p>When Jean Burke and her husband, Jack, were looking for a place, they were primarily interested in ''light, views and location,'' Ms. Burke said, ''and this had all that.'' Before leaving for work, she and her husband, who both teach at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, can monitor the traffic on the Tappan Zee Bridge from their apartment. ''We know exactly when to leave to avoid the worst of the traffic across the bridge,'' Ms. Burke said.</p>
        <p>Dolores James, owner of a real estate agency in town that bears her name, said that with the dearth of available condominiums in Piermont, she welcomes Paradise Harbor, but ''it's very pricy,'' she said. ''And it wouldn't be for everyone. People who are used to owning their own home wouldn't want to live in an apartment, even with all those services. They'd probably prefer to live in a town house instead.''</p>
        <p>Piermont was given its name by Eleazor Lord, the first president of the Erie Railroad, who named it for its long pier and mountainous countryside. For a brief period in the mid-19th century, it was the southern terminus of the railroad.</p>
        <p>Later it developed into a factory town, mostly turning out paper and cardboard. The last factory, an egg carton manufacturer, closed in 1982.</p>
        <p>Its transformation into a chic residential area began after Woody Allen used it as the setting for his film ''The Purple Rose of Cairo.'' Then other movie scouts came. ''The Juror,'' starring Demi Moore, was also filmed in Piermont.</p>
        <p>Tourists starting frequenting the little shops on Piermont Avenue, and some of then bought rundown buildings and converted them into art galleries and restaurants. ''There's no question that Piermont is hot,'' Ms. James said. ''The problem is we have no inventory. If we did, things would be selling as fast as we get them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivers said that while he never expected to be living in Rockland County, he finds Piermont the next best thing to being in Manhattan. ''It's got a nightlife and great restaurants,'' Mr. Rivers said. And, he noted, ''if I want more,'' the Upper West Side is only about 20 miles away.</p>
