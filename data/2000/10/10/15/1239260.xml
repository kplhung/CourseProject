        <p>LIEBERMAN-Hillel Eliyahu. Congregation Beth Torah mourns with deep sorrow the tragic murder of Hillel Lieberman, OBM, son of our beloved Rabbi Zevulun Lieberman. He was a kind and gentle person who dedicated and gave his life for the integrity of the land of Israel. Hillel was murdered by a Palestinian mob near Joseph's tomb while rescuing religious articles. Our hearts and prayers go out to his parents, Rabbi Zevulun and Bracha Lieberman, wife, Yael Lieberman, seven children, sisters, Tehila Lieberman, and Elyorah Ellison, and family. May The Almighty comfort them amoung all who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Elie Abadie, Rabbi Executive Committee Congregation Beth Torah</p>
