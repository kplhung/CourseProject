        <p>ALL THE NAMES</p>
        <p>By Jose Saramago.</p>
        <p>Translated by Margaret Jull Costa.</p>
        <p>238 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Harcourt. $24.</p>
        <p>''All THE NAMES'' is a novel peopled almost entirely by men and women without names. We meet the Registrar, the senior clerks, the deputy clerks, the doctor, the lady who lives in the ground-floor apartment, the keepers of the General Cemetery, the shepherd and others, but we never learn any of their names. Only the protagonist, a low-level clerk in the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths, has a name, Jose, but that is such a common name in Portugal that it effectively designates its bearer as an anonymous Everyman. Of course, Jose is also the name of the Portuguese novelist Saramago, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, and it is possible that Saramago's fantastic meditation on the essential anonymity of the living and the dead owes something to the fact that he acquired his own surname only through an error made by the clerk registering his birth in 1922.</p>
        <p>There is a chilly, stifling feel to the early pages of ''All the Names.'' It is probable that the melancholy and decaying city in which the novel is set is Lisbon, though there are no landmarks to identify it as such. Moreover, not only are the people (I am not going to call them characters) bereft of names, but they also lack physical characteristics, and we do not even know what Jose looks like. Kafka has been an acknowledged influence on Saramago's fiction, and there is certainly a Kafkaesque aspect in the precisely described procedures of the Central Registry and the topography of its record keeping. The records of those who died longest ago are stored closest to the desks of the scribbling clerks, whereas the birth and marriage certificates of the living are stored much farther back in the dark interior of the vast building; those who wish to seek out the records of the living are best advised to carry an Ariadne's thread with them, so they may be able to find their way back to the light again.</p>
        <p>The clerks are copyists and devotees of accurate detail. Deontology is their watchword (it means the science of duty). The timid and dull Jose, when he is not transcribing documents, indulges in the nerdish hobby of collecting press clippings about the famous, but one evening he is tempted to make an illicit entry into the Registry to fill out his press cuttings with information from their birth and marriage certificates.</p>
        <p>By mistake he also picks up the record of an unknown woman, someone not at all famous. For no discernible reason, he becomes obsessed with tracking her down. At first, he makes slow progress and the reader's sense of sluggishness is accentuated by Saramago's penchant for inserting authorial meditations, which are often parodic in their ponderousness. Here he is, for example, on the vexed question of why, relatively speaking, there are so few colonies of mice feeding on the papers in the Registry: ''The explanation, although there are those who harbor certain doubts as to its real relevance, must lie in the lack of water or the insufficient moisture in the atmosphere, in the dry diet of the creatures who find themselves trapped in the place where they have chosen to live or where ill luck has brought them, which would have resulted in a marked atrophy of the genital musculature with extremely negative consequences for their copulatory performance.'' Saramago always sets out his novels in long paragraphs, composed of long, coiling sentences, heavy with parenthetical speculation, but oddly underpunctuated. He has no use for quotation marks, question marks, semicolons or colons. Everything has to be done with the comma and the full stop. I have never understood why he wants his readers to have to work so hard.</p>
        <p>The pace of ''All the Names'' accelerates eventually, and Jose's mysterious, even perhaps meaningless, quest leads him on to take ever madder risks. Those risks are further exaggerated in the flights of paranoid fantasy to which he so frequently surrenders himself. Even though it is the filching and forgery of archival records, and not murder, that are at stake, the novel reads like an absurdist version of ''Crime and Punishment'' or ''The Tell-Tale Heart.'' Jose will never meet the anonymous and thoroughly obscure object of his desire, but through his questing he is transformed into a heroic obsessive and his drab, dull environment is similarly transformed into something baroque and mad.</p>
        <p>The ceiling of his room, which fancies itself as the eye of God, regularly engages in dialogues with him, though Jose is somewhat disappointed by the ceiling's penchant for talking in cliches. His quest finally takes him to the General Cemetery. Its funereal splendors, as well as the Gothic quality of Jose's morbid fears, occasion some of Saramago's most magnificent prose set pieces. The place, ''with its banks of spontaneous vegetation, its flowers, its creepers . . . and its thistles, the powerful trees whose roots often dislodged tombstones and forced up into the sunlight a few startled bones, had been both the target of and a witness to fierce wars of words and to one or two physical acts of violence.'' In this necropolis Jose imagines ''the ominous figure of death skimming the ground with a bloody scythe to make sure that the dead resign themselves to remaining dead.'' However, instead of death, he encounters a shepherd, a solemn prankster with Christlike overtones, who goes around changing the numbers on the tombstones, so that all the dead receive their fair share of mourning.</p>
        <p>In the city, in what passes for the real world in this novel, the dead are kept separate from the living, for the living have their shops and offices to go to, while the dead are kept confined underground in the cemetery. However, there is no corresponding need for the paper records of the living and the dead to be similarly segregated; the Registrar, the god of the archives, inspired by Jose's questing, decrees that henceforth the records of the living shall mingle with those of the dead. So (at the risk of weakening the narrative's suspense) it can be revealed that the momentous though somewhat enigmatic culmination of this novel is the adoption of a new filing system.</p>
        <p>''All the Names'' is more tightly focused but less nuanced and less human than what is probably Saramago's best novel, ''The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis.'' However, it is a fine, powerful parable that reads very well in Margaret Jull Costa's translation.</p>
