        <p>THE chairs that American presidents chose to use in the Executive Mansion have revealed a lot about their politics, their personalities or both. Throughout the nation's history, most presidents, not their wives, have dominated in making decisions about the decor of the White House, and many have preferred imperial-looking chairs in the public rooms even during the presidencies of Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, champions of the common man.</p>
        <p>This striking incongruity is one of the surprises found in ''Power, Politics and Style: Art for the Presidents,'' an exhibition of 100 objects -- paintings, photographs, furniture, tableware, clothing -- from 15 presidents at the Baltimore Museum of Art, through Jan. 7. The show commemorates the 200th anniversary of the White House and is the first to present objects from the presidential residences other than china and glass tableware and the Inaugural ball gowns worn by first ladies.</p>
        <p>The disparity in presidential politics and tastes even surprised James Abbott, the museum's curator of decorative arts. When he began organizing the show five years ago, Mr. Abbott expected to find that the furnishings of a president would reflect his political philosophy, as he knew they did with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.</p>
        <p>Washington's regal style was in keeping with his Federalist views of a strong centralized government, a preference on view in a full-length portrait of him by William Winstanley, in which he is depicted standing heroically in front of a throne. Jefferson, in contrast, disdained gilded and richly carved objects, choosing instead furnishings of classic simplicity -- a reflection of the tenets of the Democratic-Republican party he had helped found. A neo-Classical chair, devoid of decoration and painted pale blue-green, was one of 48 Jefferson shipped from Paris in 1790 and later brought to the White House.</p>
        <p>His successor, James Madison, also rejected much of the pomp that Washington had favored. He and his wife, Dolley, entertained frequently, and Madison commissioned the architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe to transform the palatial Blue Room by giving it a Grecian interior. Latrobe's spectacular suite of 36 chairs was based on the klismos, an ancient Greek form in which the backs were curved and raked and the legs were saberlike. The chairs were unusually democratic for the day: all were exactly the same height, which meant that the president and his guests sat as equals. Latrobe's drawings of the chair survive, and they were used to make two reproductions for the museum.</p>
        <p>''The chairs were pretty to look at but impossible to sit on and extremely fragile,'' Mr. Abbott said. ''One gentleman broke three chairs in a single evening.'' Dolley Madison probably hated the chairs, and when the British were advancing on the White House in 1814, she saved Washington's portrait and Latrobe's draperies from that room but made no attempt to remove a single chair. ''She may even have stacked them all up in the middle of the room so that if the White House was burned, the chairs would be the first to go,'' Mr. Abbott added. There was a fire, as it turned out, and not one survived.</p>
        <p>The regal style returned in the next administration, of James Monroe, who moved into the restored White House, bringing with him a wagonload of made-to-order Paris furniture dripping with gilt. Such royal trappings were also embraced by Andrew Jackson. Though he ran for office as a populist, he relished formal elegance at home in Washington. He had Ralph Earl paint numerous heroic portraits of him, including one on view in Baltimore that shows him seated on a gilded throne. That portrait, along with his penchant for rebuking Congress, prompted opponents to call him King Andrew and Yankee King.</p>
        <p>EVEN in the 20th century, presidents savored the imperial style. Theodore Roosevelt had a throne of Napoleon copied for himself in a larger size. ''The idea of Theodore Roosevelt, the trust buster and populist who championed the rights of the little man, doing this was most revealing,'' Mr. Abbott said.</p>
        <p>Roosevelt's chair, which remains in the White House, became the one that presidents who served before World War II liked to pose in. Three photographs on display show Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Calvin Coolidge all sitting in the chair. For comparison, Napoleon's throne is also in the show.</p>
        <p>While Kennedy's pro-labor and civil rights stances appealed to mainstream America, the historical redecoration of the White House, overseen by Jacqueline Kennedy, returned a sense of upper-class elegance to the mansion. Even so, his oak and cane rocking chairs, upholstered in a variety of colors, appeared throughout the White House and became a lasting iconic image of the Kennedy administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abbott acknowledged that there were times when pomp seemed to go with the office, but he added, ''I had great difficulty with some of the grandeur in this show.'' Even the American public has on occasion rejected an excess of elegance.</p>
        <p>Martin Van Buren, who dressed like a dandy, was not re-elected after being heavily criticized in Congress for the inventory of finery he had assembled in the White House. And when Richard M. Nixon took office, he commissioned new uniforms for the White House guards that looked like a Hollywood interpretation of Napoleonic garb: black and white outfits made of vinyl and polyester that were embellished with gold. Ridiculed in the press as pompous and looking too much like those worn at Buckingham Palace, they were discarded after being worn only once.</p>
        <p>For the 21st century, Mr. Abbott sees a different need in presidental decor. ''I'm a modern-style minimalist,'' Mr. Abbott said. ''If you stay locked in the 18th and early 19th centuries, you miss out on what has happened since then. I'm still waiting for a president who will put Frank Lloyd Wright or tubular steel in the Oval Office to show that the clock didn't stop in 1825.''</p>
