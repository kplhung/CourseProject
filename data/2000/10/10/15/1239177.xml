        <p>Lou Palumbo was in no mood to confess, but confession -- like a tiny chicken bone -- was caught in his throat. To spit it out required a secluded corner of a busy bar, the company of his two best friends and the assistance of at least three rounds of bottled beer.</p>
        <p>''Let's put it this way,'' Mr. Palumbo said as he lowered his voice at the rail of the Goal Post Bar in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, on Thursday night. ''The Yanks and the Metties make it into a Subway Series. They square off, but the Yankees lose. You think I'm ever going to live that down? Me and my big mouth's been blabbing about the Yanks for years. And then the Mets take it? Here in New York? No way I'm ever going to live that down.''</p>

        <p>Lou Palumbo was in no mood to confess, but confession -- like a tiny chicken bone -- was caught in his throat. To spit it out required a secluded corner of a busy bar, the company of his two best friends and the assistance of at least three rounds of bottled beer.</p>
        <p>''Let's put it this way,'' Mr. Palumbo said as he lowered his voice at the rail of the Goal Post Bar in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, on Thursday night. ''The Yanks and the Metties make it into a Subway Series. They square off, but the Yankees lose. You think I'm ever going to live that down? Me and my big mouth's been blabbing about the Yanks for years. And then the Mets take it? Here in New York? No way I'm ever going to live that down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Palumbo is a brawny general contractor with hands as thick as a stack of pancakes -- a man who does not appear to be frightened of much.</p>
        <p>But like a small group of his fellow New York baseball fans, Mr. Palumbo has been burdened by a shameful secret in recent days.</p>
        <p>With a potential Yankees-Mets World Series putting the ultimate baseball bragging rights on the line, he would rather -- gulp -- see only one New York squad make it into the championship than -- double gulp -- risk the indignity of his own beloved team suffering the humiliating loss.</p>
        <p>It's heresy to think it. It's sacrilege to admit it. And it's probably physically dangerous to be caught announcing it too loudly. But some New York baseball fans are actually dreading a Subway Series. The stakes are just too high. The neuroses too deep seated. The fear of an irreversible, highly publicized failure simply too much to bear.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that most people around town are dying for a Subway Series. After all, New York hasn't been blessed with such divine indulgence since 1956, when Mickey Mantle and the Yankees beat Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers in a seven-game nail-biter that included Don Larsen's perfect game.</p>
        <p>It will take some work this season on the part of both teams in the league championship series. Will the Yankees take it today in five after Roger Clemens's shutout last night? Will the Mets manage to do the same tomorrow, despite yesterday's loss?</p>
        <p>But the possibility of another all-Gotham World Series has become deliciously, if terrifyingly, real. It scares the heck out of Sonia Jimenez, for example.</p>
        <p>''The closer it gets, the more afraid I get,'' said Ms. Jimenez, a die-hard Yankees fan who works as a medical secretary at a Manhattan doctor's office. ''I don't want to hear the Mets fans rubbing it in our faces if they win. If it were up to me, I'd rather the Yankees and the Cardinals make it to the Series.''</p>
        <p>A Subway Series would, of course, arouse separate apprehensions in the minds of the teams and their fans. The Yankees, the reigning (but aging) champions, would be worried about losing their top-dog status to the underdogs. The Mets, the scrappy (but untested) upstarts, would be worried about having their underdog-hood confirmed, once and for all, in front of a watchful city of unforgiving fans.</p>
        <p>Dr. Phil Lee, a Manhattan psychiatrist who specializes in sports, sees deep Freudian theories at work in this scheme. For the Mets and their fans, he envisions a Series fraught with the angst of childhood; for the Yankees and their fans, he imagines a championship battle rife with Oedipal concerns.</p>
        <p>''For a lot of Mets fans, the Series could tap into some of the indignities of growing up -- struggling against the more powerful team, the father, the older brother, the schoolyard bully,'' Dr. Lee explained. ''For Yankee fans, on the other hand, there is the fear that their powers are waning and that the young gunslingers will push them out of the way.''</p>
        <p>With all that anxiety floating around, it's hardly a surprise that some New York baseball fans want to steer clear of watching the Mets and Yankees go head to head, said Daniel Wann, an associate professor of psychology at Murray State University in Murray, Ky. In the minds of many, he said, it's better to have a milquetoast Series between the Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals or the Seattle Mariners and the Mets.</p>
        <p>''There are silent fears out there,'' Professor Wann said by telephone the other day. ''I guarantee it. If the Yankees lose to the Mets, then the Yankee mystique is gone. By the same token, Mets fans have always been underdog kind of rooters. They always root for the David. If all of a sudden David becomes Goliath, then what happens? That component of the team's identity and charm is eliminated.''</p>
        <p>At this early stage of Subway Series-osis, the worst fears seems to be more prevalent among Yankees fans than among Mets fans. Chris Carlin, the producer of ''Mike and the Mad Dog,'' a sports radio talk program on WFAN, said there were several calls last week by nervous Yankee boosters but fewer by Mets fans.</p>
        <p>''The sense I've gotten from the Yankees fans who have called is, 'Yeah, we want a Subway Series, but we're scared to death of losing to the Mets,' '' Mr. Carlin said. ''But I don't get the feeling that Mets fans are against it as much. They want a chance to knock off the Yanks. For them, it's a no-lose situation: they could step right into the World Series, and nobody expects them to beat the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>A quick trip to Yankee Stadium on Friday morning as fans were lining up to buy World Series tickets turned up several permutations of the Subway Series syndrome.</p>
        <p>The version suffered by Galen Ko, 29, of Manhattan made him so feverish that he said he would rather see the Yankees lose to the Mariners and not make it into the World Series at all than to make it and then fail.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather lose to Seattle than the Mets,'' he said. ''I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. If we lose to them, we're taking a step back.''</p>
        <p>The symptoms of Alex Arroyo, 28, a United Parcel Service driver, were debilitating but less severe: he still wanted the two teams to face off, but said he was riven by fear that if the Mets won, their fans would have another 44 years in which to holler, ''We beat you in the big dance.''</p>
        <p>At the Goal Post Bar, Lou Palumbo wasn't thinking about a night's sleep or the big dance at all. He was still trying to convince his buddies, Kevin Gentile and Ronnie Still, that he wasn't a traitor, just an imperfect human being, a good man with the occasional badness in his soul.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gentile told his friend that there was still time to atone for his sins. Mr. Still agreed. But Mr. Palumbo, unable to repent, figured that he ought to own up to his true nature.</p>
        <p>''O.K., so I'm a jerk,'' he said, downing his brew and offering his chin to his friends. ''So who wants the first shot?''</p>
