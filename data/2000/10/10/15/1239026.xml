        <p>THERE are two things you can count on at almost any New York gala: The food will be catered by Glorious Food, and Nan Kempner will descend the red carpet, place herself directly in front of a brace of photographers and beam at them her most captivating smile.</p>
        <p>She may not know it, but in courting the cameras and thus insuring that fame courts her, Ms. Kempner is indebted to a famous 19th-century predecessor, the Countess de Castiglione.

        <p>THERE are two things you can count on at almost any New York gala: The food will be catered by Glorious Food, and Nan Kempner will descend the red carpet, place herself directly in front of a brace of photographers and beam at them her most captivating smile.</p>
        <p>She may not know it, but in courting the cameras and thus insuring that fame courts her, Ms. Kempner is indebted to a famous 19th-century predecessor, the Countess de Castiglione. The most celebrated beauty of her day, La Divine Comtesse, as the French called her, was never one to wait for celebrity to seek her out. Instead, she chased it, compulsively and relentlessly, through the then quite novel medium of photography.</p>
        <p>Now, more than a century after she commissioned them, her portraits are on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Some 90 highly theatrical images, created at the countess's command by the Paris firm of Mayer &amp; Pierson between 1856 and 1895, trace the trajectory of this diva's career. Glamorous demimondaine, spy for the court of Savoy, mistress of the French emperor Napoleon III, the countess was all these and more -- a delirious, self-promoting fantasist.</p>
        <p>Image after image shows this Italian aristocrat and consummate creature of fashion celebrating her public triumphs and her feverish inner life in pictures that were styled, lighted and sometimes even retouched by the countess herself.</p>
        <p>A mistress of attitude, long before the word became the catch phrase of the fashion set, she knew how to strike a pose that was haughty or coy, pious or lewd, mysterious or childishly transparent. Dressing for the camera in billowing costumes, she assumed the persona of languid odalisque, placid peasant, Ingres nude and nun, and even the queen of Etruria, a dagger-wielding glowering ruler from antiquity.</p>
        <p>Swathed though she was in dazzling period frocks, the countess, who was born Virginia Oldoini in 1837, gazes out of these portraits with a self-possession that strikes a modern viewer as startlingly contemporary.</p>
        <p>As well it might. Her self-dramatizing portraits conjure the images of modern artists like Cindy Sherman and Sophie Calle. And the countess shares with her present-day counterparts -- artists, photographers and style-struck civilians --  an impulse that lies at the heart of fashion: to document her life, create a personal narrative and, more than these, to halt time in its tracks.</p>
        <p>The passion to arrest the moment, to snatch something lasting from fashion, that most ephemeral of arts, will be familiar to anyone who has ever worked on the set of a fashion shoot. Watching stylists, models and hairdressers tirelessly freeze-frame each other in Polaroids makes you think of a fly preserved in amber. The same impulse to endure is shared by every aspiring social swan waiting for her moment to shine in the lens.</p>
        <p>Such endless posing and posturing has partly to do with a wish for perfection, said Wayne Koestenbaum, who explored Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's diva instinct in ''Jackie Under My Skin'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1995). It represents a desire to render oneself into an image as seductive and enduring as a sphinx. At its most successful, fashion and fashion photography, ''can resemble stone or marble,'' Mr. Koestenbaum said, adding, ''It can exhibit a kind of imperial grandeur.''</p>
        <p>The countess seemed to have understood that innately; so well, in fact, that she might have given lessons to those modern divas who strive to be legends in their time. Outrageously narcissistic, the countess turned self-veneration into a virtue through her portraits and transformed herself into a durable, impenetrable work of art.</p>
        <p>Her admirers, who are quoted extensively in the exhibition catalog, said it was a feat that she pulled off each time she entered a room. Arriving at a gala, the countess evidently viewed herself not as mere frail flesh, pinched inside an unforgiving corset, but as a monument destined to live on in the minds of her beholders.</p>
        <p>''She would appear at gatherings like a goddess, and allow people to admire her as if she were a shrine,'' recalled General Fleury, one of Napoleon III's commanders. Rendered all but immobile in a towering powdered coiffure and pyramid-shaped evening dress, she could ''meet with glacial calm the indiscreet stares of her admirers,'' the general wrote.</p>
        <p>His account brings to mind gala entrances of any number of contemporary limelight-seeking starlets and socialites: Jennifer Lopez heating up libidos in a navel-baring Versace at the Oscars, or Anna Wintour, looking well defended in a satin halter dress and meticulous haircut, at the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute ball.</p>
        <p>Like the countess, these fixtures of  New York society have cultivated a high-gloss facade that seems designed to plaster over their identities or recreate them outright. But as diligently as they may buff their images, the countess surpassed them, creating, in her day, a persona clearly destined for posterity. That notion must surely have occurred to her;  she used her portraits as postcards, sending them out to friends and foes alike.</p>
        <p>A decaying, slightly mad recluse in her waning years, she died alone in 1899, becoming even more celebrated than even she could have anticipated. Since her death, her flamboyant life has been the subject of countless novels, articles, poems, plays and films, including ''La Contessa di Castiglione,'' in 1954, in which Yvonne de Carlo played the title role.</p>
        <p>Whether she achieved fame or notoriety is a distinction her fashion-obsessed modern-day counterparts might not be inclined to make. She had, after all, the sort of buzz that is to die for.</p>
