        <p>RED STICK MEN</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By Tim Parrish.</p>
        <p>University Press of Mississippi, $22.</p>
        <p>Baton Rouge -- or ''Red Stick'' as it's called by the locals -- asserts a harsh influence over the men whose stories make up Tim Parrish's impressive first collection. The nine stories here are uniformly absorbing and original, and they cover a period from the late 1960's through the Persian Gulf war and the early 90's. The five most memorable stories follow the lives of two brothers, Jeb and Bob. These stories are told from Jeb's perspective at first, and through this young boy's developing consciousness we see him confront not only physical danger (a flood that threatens his home) but also the complexities of Southern bigotry and the cruel obstacles of class distinctions. In two later stories, we see the world from Bob's point of view -- he's a disillusioned and disgruntled Vietnam veteran and former cop who has been drifting for years through a series of pointless jobs. In a story called ''Exterminator,'' Bob's determination to win back his former girlfriend while advancing himself in the pesticide business seems doomed from the start. His pain is palpable: ''A 40-year-old man, alone and killing bugs for a living. He'd never imagined it.'' With subtle irony and spare prose Parrish evokes the hard-won strength of the people who live in Baton Rouge's industrial underbelly.</p>
