        <p>TAKE a look down there, below your feet. There's your Oriental carpet, finely woven, perhaps 100 years old. It may be a treasured heirloom, or a valuable purchase worth tens, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet you lay it on the floor and walk on it day in and day out. The children spill juice on it, the dog has accidents on it and the cats claw it when nobody is around.</p>
        <p>Luckily, said Antoinette Lombardi, co-owner of the Oriental Rug Gallery in Hawthorne, ''You can't kill a good Oriental rug.''</p>

        <p>TAKE a look down there, below your feet. There's your Oriental carpet, finely woven, perhaps 100 years old. It may be a treasured heirloom, or a valuable purchase worth tens, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet you lay it on the floor and walk on it day in and day out. The children spill juice on it, the dog has accidents on it and the cats claw it when nobody is around.</p>
        <p>Luckily, said Antoinette Lombardi, co-owner of the Oriental Rug Gallery in Hawthorne, ''You can't kill a good Oriental rug.''</p>
        <p>Not that people haven't tried. ''People water their plants, something leaks and the rug rots,'' said Ms. Lombardi, a k a ''The Rug Lady,'' to her clients. ''Or perhaps a rug was stored in a damp basement where moths and mildew got to it. Someone brought us a rug that was partially eaten away by battery acid that leaked from a flashlight. Maybe the vacuum cleaner ate the fringe; maybe the dog ate the corner.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to cleaning, ''There are no miracles,'' she said, but added, ''the faster you attend to a stain, the more likely you'll be able to remove it.''</p>
        <p>But cleaning a rug improperly causes problems. ''One of our customers had a $30,000 rug cleaned and put away,'' she said, ''and when he opened it, half of the rug was destroyed. We took the remaining half and made six smaller rugs from it.''</p>
        <p>Hand washing is the most thorough method of cleaning antique rugs, contemporary handmade rugs and machine-made ''Belgium'' or Karastan-type rugs. ''Lanolin in the wool that is used to weave the rug is a key factor in its look and feel,'' explained Andrew Paoletti, owner of Paoletti Oriental Rugs in Ossining. ''You can't dry clean a handmade rug because the solvents dry it out.''</p>
        <p>Hand washing involves full immersion, wetting and shampooing both sides of the carpet (''You can't wash only the front,'' he said. ''That just moves the dirt around.'') and washing fringes separately so they won't turn gray.</p>
        <p>Because carpets require lots of water and become quite heavy when wet, and because dyes can bleed, Mr. Paoletti favors professional cleaning. ''Do-it-yourself rug washing can be a minefield,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hand washing, though, is not appropriate for all rugs. ''Silk rugs must be dry cleaned, since they can't get wet,'' said Greg Proudian of A. T. Proudian in New Rochelle. ''And very old rugs that are in a weakened condition should be steam cleaned, because hand shampooing is a pretty rugged procedure.''</p>
        <p>For spot removal, including challenges like gum, grease or tar, dry cleaning fluid is applied to small areas. ''If that doesn't work,'' Mr. Proudian said, ''we comb, trim and, as a last resort, we cut out the area and reweave.''</p>
        <p>Cleaning costs vary as much as the rugs themselves, with steam cleaning the least expensive and the least effective, Mr. Paoletti said.  ''You can steam clean a room for $20 to $40,'' he said, ''but it's a formula approach, and it only cleans the top of the carpet.''</p>
        <p>Hand shampooing is priced by the square foot, ranging from $1.50 to $8, but generally around $2. ''You're paying for the individualized care,''  Mr. Paoletti explained, ''for the dye tests, the temperature and pH control, the elbow pressure.''</p>
        <p>Some cleaners charge a pick-up and delivery fee, including moving furniture, and others charge an unrolling fee, which can add up to an additional $30 or $40. ''If you're being charged 50 or 60 cents a square foot, it's not being washed by hand,'' Ms. Lombardi said.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Lombardi said that a handmade Oriental carpet is ''pretty indestructible,'' all the experts had suggestions for keeping them in prime condition.</p>
        <p>The No. 1 way to keep your rugs cleaner, Mr. Paoletti said, is to remove shoes before walking on it.</p>
        <p>All the experts said that proper padding is essential to prevent skidding and reduce wear.</p>
        <p>''A good pad protects your rug,''  Ms. Lombardi said. ''It lets it breathe and lets the dust fall to the floor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Paoletti suggested vacuuming both sides of the rug as often as possible, vacuuming in the direction of the pile. Ms. Lombardi recommends turning the entire rug upside down once a year, vacuuming the back, and then leaving it for a few days so the dust will fall out.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how meticulous a  housekeeper is, however, even the best of Oriental carpets will eventually show their age. ''It's only to be expected,'' Mr. Proudian said.  ''Think of all the fading and the wear and tear on a rug that's 100 years old. I mean, How would you look after 100 years?''</p>
