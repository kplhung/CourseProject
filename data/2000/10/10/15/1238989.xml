        <p>FRUSTRATED by the meager checking account deals offered by their local banks, consumers  may turn to the Internet, thinking that they can do better. After all, that is where they have found competitive deals on cars, books and even, until lately, groceries.</p>
        <p>But attractive offers are harder to find in the online banking world, especially when it comes to checking accounts offered by major banks. Many of those institutions offer customers the same rates and fees on their Web sites as they do at their neighborhood branches. Moreover, the most attractive rates and fees are sometimes determined by the customer's ZIP code, both for technical and competitive reasons. That was what Bankrate.com found in its semiannual survey of the 10 largest financial institutions in the country's 35 major markets. (The checking account pricing survey is at www.bankrate.com.)</p>

        <p>FRUSTRATED by the meager checking account deals offered by their local banks, consumers  may turn to the Internet, thinking that they can do better. After all, that is where they have found competitive deals on cars, books and even, until lately, groceries.</p>
        <p>But attractive offers are harder to find in the online banking world, especially when it comes to checking accounts offered by major banks. Many of those institutions offer customers the same rates and fees on their Web sites as they do at their neighborhood branches. Moreover, the most attractive rates and fees are sometimes determined by the customer's ZIP code, both for technical and competitive reasons. That was what Bankrate.com found in its semiannual survey of the 10 largest financial institutions in the country's 35 major markets. (The checking account pricing survey is at www.bankrate.com.)</p>
        <p>''We noticed that accounts obtained on the Internet are the same ones you'd get walking into a brick-and-mortar bank,'' said Greg McBride, a financial analyst at Bankrate.com, a company in West Palm Beach, Fla., that tracks the financial services industry.</p>
        <p>Bankrate.com also said that many big banks with operations spread across several regions practiced ''geographic discrimination,'' in which deals vary greatly by state. (Consumers who visit the banks' Web sites are often asked to disclose their ZIP codes before any information is dispensed.)</p>
        <p>Mr. McBride said Wells Fargo's Stagecoach Interest Checking Account charges customers in Seattle, online or off line, a $13 monthly service fee, unless they keep a minimum balance of $100; the bounced-check fee is $28. In San Francisco, he said, the service fee is $10, the minimum balance is $2,000, and the bounced-check fee is $15.</p>
        <p>Bank of America customers in California get a better deal on its interest-bearing checking account than those in Florida. In California, accounts below the minimum balance carry a $12 monthly fee and pay 0.4 percent interest; in Florida, Mr. McBride said, there is a $14 monthly fee and 0.25 percent rate.</p>
        <p>STEPHEN BROBECK, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer group based in Washington, said banks should give customers better, more consistent deals.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that Internet banking should be less costly for consumers,'' he said. ''Internet banking should also be systemwide, not local, and therefore benefit from economies of scale and lower costs.''</p>
        <p>For their part, major banks acknowledge the disparities in their practices. Some bank officials blame  the continuing mergers and acquisitions within the industry, which often result in fragmented operations.</p>
        <p>Thomas A. Kelly, a spokesman for Bank One, which is based in Chicago and whose branches span Texas, Louisiana, Arizona and the Midwest, said the bank's regional computer systems were largely incompatible with one another. He said he expected to see the problem rectified -- and fee and rate schedules integrated -- over the next three years. Eloise Q. Hale, a Bank of America spokeswoman, said her bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., was doing the same. ''Everything is being unified to increase consistency,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Even so, that will not necessarily translate into lower costs. ''The banks' fixed costs aren't going away,'' said Theodore J. Iacobuzio, a senior analyst at the TowerGroup, a research firm based in Needham, Mass.</p>
        <p>Bankrate.com recommends that consumers looking for the best deals consider ''pure'' Internet banks. Many of those banks, including nBank, First Internet Bank of Indiana, and directbanking.com, offer free, interest-bearing checking accounts, electronic bill payment, and rebates of other banks' A.T.M. fees,  according to Gomez Advisors, an Internet consulting firm that rates Web-based consumer services.</p>
        <p>Christopher E. Musto, a vice president for research at Gomez, said  consumers had another option. Many major banks waive fees for consumers willing to do business electronically, using the telephone, A.T.M. or Internet.</p>
        <p>Of course, Internet banking is still not for everyone; some people prefer talking to real tellers, or they are reluctant to break old habits. ''You may prefer to walk into a Wells Fargo branch because it's in the lobby of your office building,'' Mr. Musto said.</p>
