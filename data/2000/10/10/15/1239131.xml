        <p>Two men were killed and a 73-year-old woman was wounded early yesterday after a misstep in the entrance to a Bronx restaurant led to an argument and gunfire, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police identified the two dead men as Claude Cruz, 31, of Queens Village and Maurice Townsend, 28, of the Bronx. The wounded woman, Maria Maisonet, was struck in the thigh by a stray bullet. She was treated at Lincoln Hospital and released.</p>
        <p>The police said the encounter began just before 3 a.m. at the Taino Restaurant at 849 Prospect Avenue in the Morrisania section. One of three men who were leaving the small restaurant brushed up against one of two men who were entering.</p>
        <p>Words were exchanged, but the two men who were entering continued into the restaurant, said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman. But one of the men who had been leaving followed, with a revolver drawn, the police said.</p>
        <p>The two men who had just entered tried to get away, running toward the kitchen, the police said. But the gunman opened fire in the cramped, narrow dining room. At least six shots were fired.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maisonet, a regular patron of the restaurant, said she ran from the dining room into the kitchen and discovered she was hurt. One of the two victims died on the floor of the kitchen, she said. The second man died in the dining area. Ms. Maisonet said she had been standing between the gunman and his victims during the shootings.</p>
        <p>She had gone to the restaurant to watch the Yankees play and had stayed into the early morning hours, she said.</p>
        <p>''I was standing by the door talking with the barmaid and I told the barmaid I was going home, and then I saw the guy running and at the same time shooting,'' Ms. Maisonet said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''The barmaid screamed, 'Maria! Run!' I heard bang, bang, 'Oh my God,' and then I ran.''</p>
        <p>The police said the gunman was described as a 6-foot-tall black man between 20 and 25 years old with a slim build. He was wearing a red leather jacket and a red baseball cap.</p>
