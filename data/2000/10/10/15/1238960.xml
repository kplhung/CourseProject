        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Madigan Men'' is not Gabriel Byrne's ''first foray into series television,'' as Peter Marks states in his article ''A Leading Man Tries TV in a Show About Men'' [Oct. 8]. Growing up in Ireland in the late 1970's, I remember Mr. Byrne as the brooding farmhand who seduced the virtuous Maggie Riordan in the barn while her husband, Benjy, was away in Kenya. The show was ''The Rior  dans,'' a long-running rural soap opera. Mr. Byrne's subsequent fame led to his own show, ''Bracken.'' Mr. Byrne was again the brooding newcomer in a rural community. His love interests were Fiona, the squire's daughter, and Eve, whose cropped blonde hair became a minor fad.</p>
