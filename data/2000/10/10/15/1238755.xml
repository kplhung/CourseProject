        <p>The Last Samurai</p>
        <p>By Helen DeWitt.</p>

        <p>Open to any page in ''The Last Samurai'' and, three times out of five, you're likely to be confronted by brief snippets of Greek or Japanese, complete with their English equivalents. This is because Helen DeWitt's exuberant first novel is largely about translation. DeWitt's characters are caught up in several translation projects, ranging from the standard linguistic variety to the more delicate deciphering of interpersonal communications to a quixotic attempt to transform a film into a guide to life.</p>
        <p>The progenitor of these projects is Sibylla, a woman of frightening intellectual intensity who trades America for Oxford in an attempt to avoid a family tradition of dreams deferred. Frustrated by the limited scope of her Oxford studies, she soon drops out, opting for a precarious existence at society's margins in a sad parallel to the American life she had tried to escape. Nine months after a drunken tryst with a popular travel writer, Sibylla gives birth to Ludo, a child prodigy who at 4 is reading the ''Odyssey'' in Greek. Sibylla refuses Ludo knowledge of his father because she can't bear the idea of involving such a banal man in the life of her son. As a father substitute, Sibylla offers Kurosawa's film ''The Seven Samurai,'' which she watches obsessively in her attempt to escape the drudgery and mediocrity of the real world. Rather than sating Ludo's paternal yearnings, the film inspires him to embark, at 11, upon a quest to choose his own father.</p>
        <p>Like her characters, DeWitt is eager to display her intellectual and artistic gifts. It is easy to be carried along by the tempo of her prose, which alternates between short, sharp sentences and sprawling passages that leave you gasping for breath. At its best, the writing is playful and engaging, a mix of David Foster Wallace's intellectual colloquialism and the modern fabulism of Aimee Bender. Through textual interweaving reminiscent of quick cinematic cuts, DeWitt will intermingle dialogue between Ludo and his mother with Ludo's running commentary, scenes from Kurosawa's film and linguistic asides. These textual melanges can at times be heavy-handed and muddled. At these moments, her prose eerily resembles the writing of Ludo's father, ''quick and nervous and anxious to seem anxious to please.''</p>
        <p>Much of the novel's early sections are spent proving how smart Sibylla and Ludo are. Ludo has inherited from Sibylla an extraordinary facility for language. Under her tutelage he picks up not only Greek but Hebrew, Arabic and Japanese before moving on to the rest of the major spoken languages and a slew of minor ones. The book initially focuses on Sibylla's struggle to provide for her intellectually voracious son. As Ludo grows older, however, he takes center stage and Sibylla fades, frustratingly, into the background.</p>
        <p>Ludo shares the novel's narrative center with a cast of seven potential fathers, one literal and six wishful, whom Ludo seeks out during his Kurosawa-inspired quest. The lives of these men are provided in asides that almost constitute a short-story collection within the body of the novel. DeWitt's imaginative powers are showcased here as she details these engaging and eccentric men, luminaries in fields ranging from astronomy to professional bridge. DeWitt's facility with their stories is so convincing that you wonder, briefly, if these characters are based upon historical figures -- a true marker of effective fiction. Ironically, these men often feel more real than Sibylla herself, who becomes more a collection of quirks than a multidimensional presence. Scenes between her and Ludo lack the dynamism of scenes between Ludo and his would-be fathers.</p>
        <p>Among the pitfalls facing first novelists, perhaps the best one to fall into is the hazard of being overly ambitious. ''The Last Samurai'' would have benefited from deeper character and plot development and a editor more willing to excise chaff, but Helen DeWitt shows she is a writer willing to take chances. Though the book worships too long at the altar of the intellect, her intelligence provides sparkle as well as promise.</p>
