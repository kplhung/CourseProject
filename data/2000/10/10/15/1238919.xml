        <p>THERE is a realm of public space in New York City more than 80 acres in extent -- greater, that is, than Battery Park, Carl Schurz Park, Morningside Park and Tompkins Square Park combined -- of which the public knows almost nothing.</p>
        <p>The city paid for this space through a 39-year-old incentive program that has permitted developers who furnished plazas, arcades, walkways and atriums to build 16 million square feet more floor area than would ordinarily have been allowed. That is roughly seven Empire State Buildings above and beyond normal zoning limits.</p>

        <p>THERE is a realm of public space in New York City more than 80 acres in extent -- greater, that is, than Battery Park, Carl Schurz Park, Morningside Park and Tompkins Square Park combined -- of which the public knows almost nothing.</p>
        <p>The city paid for this space through a 39-year-old incentive program that has permitted developers who furnished plazas, arcades, walkways and atriums to build 16 million square feet more floor area than would ordinarily have been allowed. That is roughly seven Empire State Buildings above and beyond normal zoning limits.</p>
        <p>But no methodical records were kept of the diverse, dispersed public spaces that resulted. So while community groups struggled over this ill-kempt plaza or that padlocked arcade, no one had a comprehensive inventory of privately owned public space: where it was, what it was, who owned it, how they had benefited, what amenities were required, how many are actually offered and whether the space was being kept truly public.</p>
        <p>That is about to change. A book analyzing every one of the city's 503 privately owned public spaces at 320 buildings in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens is to be published Friday. It rates all the spaces. Fifteen were found to be of such high quality (what the book terms destination spaces) that they draw visitors from across the city, while 66 neighborhood spaces attract people from the community. But 207 marginal spaces, to use the authors' words, are poorly enough designed or maintained that they actually deter the public from using them.</p>
        <p>The study, by Jerold S. Kayden of Harvard University, the City Planning Department and the Municipal Art Society, involved three and a half years of field surveys and what Mr. Kayden called ''forensic accounting,'' reconstructing a broken trail of approvals, permits and agreements. It has already made news with its conclusion that more than half the spaces have failed in some way.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration has announced an enforcement effort including three civil lawsuits against the owners of public spaces that city officials believe have been illegally stripped of amenities, illegally closed to the public or illegally annexed by commercial interests.</p>
        <p>A more enduring consequence of the study, however, is likely to be its enumeration of all 3,584,034 square feet of privately owned public space. In essence, it opens New Yorkers' eyes to the amenities to which they are entitled and informs landlords of their obligations. The book, ''Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons), will later be supplemented with a database on the planning agency's Web site.</p>
        <p>What makes this census of so much potential use to open-space advocates is that it casts light on many public areas that, by design or maintenance, are not self-evident. It is almost impossible to demand unimpeded access or to enforce requirements for amenities like seating, plantings, drinking fountains and bicycle racks when neither citizens nor city officials know that a space is designated for public use in the first place.</p>
        <p>Frequently, there are no signs to say the public is welcome. Sometimes, owners or tenants implicitly assert that spaces are private by installing doors, gates, fences and barricades, or by allowing restaurants and stores to take over areas set aside for the public, a phenomenon that Mr. Kayden, an associate professor in the Harvard Graduate School of Design, describes as ''cafe creep.''</p>
        <p>Few New Yorkers, for example, realize that the four-story limestone-clad atrium in the Henri Bendel store at 712 Fifth Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets, is technically part of a ''permanent passageway,'' 2,100 square feet of public space that extends to the midblock lobby of the adjoining office tower. This particular space did not yield a development bonus but was required under the terms of a special permit granted to the project.</p>
        <p>The new study states that the Fifth Avenue atrium ''at all times shall be restricted to unobstructed lobby use and may not be used for any retail sales activity.'' However, on Wednesday, six tables, eight chairs and eight stools were set up in the atrium for demonstrating Laura Mercier cosmetics. A representative of Laura Mercier in the store said that no selling was done in the atrium, only brief makeovers for customers interested in sampling products.</p>
        <p>But the book calls it a ''commercial takeover.'' And Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, said the problem recurs. ''What Bendel keeps doing is wrong,'' he said. ''They're bringing the department store into the temple. That activity diminishes the grandeur of that space.''</p>
        <p>Also at issue is the ability of visitors to view the Lalique windows that date to 1910, when the landmark building was a Coty perfumery. Anthony Hebron, a spokesman for the Limited Inc., which owns Bendel, said the company was committed to assuring ''continued public viewing access,'' although he acknowledged that ''there have been some times when a little of the space was briefly occupied.'' The Lalique windows are being refurbished, he said.</p>
        <p>Bendel is scarcely alone in appropriating open space for its own use. In one instance, the city government itself has done so.</p>
        <p>''It stands as a perfect example of the lack of information that existed and of the value of the book,'' said David Karnovsky, counsel to the planning department.</p>
        <p>Along the Washington Street facade of the 40 Rector Street office building, a sliver of plaza -- really no more than a wide place in the sidewalk -- has been taken over by a one-story scooter shed for the Police Department Downtown Center. It was built in cooperation with the Alliance for Downtown New York, which manages the lower Manhattan business improvement district.</p>
        <p>''Neither I nor, indeed, anyone here had any idea that this little area was a bonused plaza,'' said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance, in an e-mail message. In its days as a restaurant, he said, the space was hidden from the street by a high fence.</p>
        <p>''The building owner suggested that we use this area for the First Precinct scooters and we were only too happy to do so,'' Mr. Weisbrod said. ''In fact, one might say that the area is more public now than at any time in the recent past.''</p>
        <p>Joseph B. Rose, director of the planning agency and chairman of the City Planning Commission, noted that the police substation proposal had gone through public review, even though no one involved realized at the time that it was being built on 795 square feet of bonus-generating space.</p>
        <p>Another public space that eludes recognition is the midblock plaza behind the Westvaco Building, 299 Park Avenue, from 48th to 49th Street. It looks like the driveway that nearby signs declare it to be. Gates at either end declare: ''Not a Walkway.''</p>
        <p>BUT according to the survey, this ''Private Driveway'' is in fact part of a 15,313-square-foot plaza around the building that generated a development bonus of 153,130 square feet for Fisher Brothers, which built and still owns the tower. The midblock part of the plaza is roughly 7,000 square feet. At a bonus rate of 10 square feet of floor area for every square foot of plaza, that would mean it accounted for 70,000 square feet of office space, or almost three floors in the 42-story building.</p>
        <p>The survey reports statements from the owner that the plaza is used by the Secret Service. (The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel is across the street.) However, one car parked there on a recent afternoon was registered to Fisher Brothers. Telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment on the plaza from Fisher Brothers were not returned.</p>
        <p>One space that partly disappeared even before the new study could draw it to the attention of passers-by is the arcade on the Lexington Avenue side of 245 Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>The 14,098-square-foot arcade generated a bonus of 42,294 square feet, more than a full floor of the 44-story tower. Now, about 65 feet of the arcade along Lexington Avenue, at the 46th Street corner, have been filled in. The owner, Brookfield Financial Properties, may put a restaurant there.</p>
        <p>According to city planners, the rationale began with a calculation by Brookfield that mechanical space had increased in the building. Because mechanical space is not counted by zoning rules as floor area, that would technically have reduced the overall square footage of the building, thereby reducing the zoning bonus needed and, in turn, the commensurate amount of public space the owner is obliged to provide.</p>
        <p>Brookfield said in a statement that it had to enlarge mechanical space in the 33-year-old building to meet tenants' needs for electric power and air-conditioning. ''While that step decreases the amount of usable office space in the building and the public space allotment,'' the statement said, ''it was essential to ensuring 245 Park's future as a Class A property and significant contributor to the city's tax rolls.''</p>
        <p>It is not the first time that such an alteration has been made to public space without public review. Speaking generally of the practice, Mr. Rose said: ''Public space cannot vanish overnight because of a recalculation of floor area. These were agreements between the public and private sector.</p>
        <p>''It's not hard to imagine such modifications to existing space serving the public interest,'' Mr. Rose said, ''but the important thing is that the public have the right to review and approve such modifications.''</p>
        <p>The City Planning Department has filed three civil lawsuits and issued eight violation notices with the Environmental Control Board, an administrative tribunal.</p>
        <p>The lawsuits are against 40 Broad Street, an office building downtown with a plaza from which the required benches, planters and trees have been removed; Parc East Tower, an apartment building at 240 East 27th Street, which has locked a midblock passageway to its mini-park and waterfall; and Worldwide Plaza on Eighth Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets, where city officials say that the required chairs and tables have been appropriated by restaurants on the edge of the plaza.</p>
        <p>Open-space advocates believe the study can be put to use at a grassroots level. Thomas Balsley, a landscape architect who has designed numerous public spaces, envisions a ''plaza posse'' of citizens and community groups that would monitor spaces and report problems to the city.</p>
        <p>Complaints about plazas that are not open or that fail to provide required amenities can be made to the Buildings Department at (212) 227-7000, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The caller should press 2 at the prompt, refer to ''public space'' and be as specific as possible about the address and problem.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 28, the Municipal Art Society will send out volunteers to update the field surveys, in an operation dubbed the Holly Watch, after the late William H. (Holly) Whyte, a student of urban open space. This event is tied into the society's exhibition, ''The World's Most Expensive Public Space,'' at the Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue, between 50th and 51st Streets.</p>
        <p>Some results may be surprising. M. Barry Schneider, the chairman of Community Board 8 on the Upper East Side, has long been vexed by the locked gate to the garden of the Concorde, 220 East 65th Street. ''It's a lovely plaza with a pool and rushing water and you can't get there from here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A glimpse at the survey, however, reveals that it is not the garden but a garage driveway that constitutes the public space.</p>
