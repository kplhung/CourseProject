        <p>Now that work is under way on renovations to the fire-damaged St. George Hotel, cranes and scaffolding have surrounded the site, creating noise and cutting off access to the sidewalk. Some neighbors said they were worried about how the new hotel would be run. But many expressed relief that a building was  finally going up on the blighted lot. A lawyer for Moshe Drizin, the owner, said the new boutique hotel, an 11-story structure with 220 rooms, was scheduled to be finished in early 2002.</p>
        <p>Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, said that since the St. George had previously served as a single-room-occupancy hotel for the poor, she would like to see Mr. Drizin hire an outside operator for the new project.</p>

        <p>Now that work is under way on renovations to the fire-damaged St. George Hotel, cranes and scaffolding have surrounded the site, creating noise and cutting off access to the sidewalk. Some neighbors said they were worried about how the new hotel would be run. But many expressed relief that a building was  finally going up on the blighted lot. A lawyer for Moshe Drizin, the owner, said the new boutique hotel, an 11-story structure with 220 rooms, was scheduled to be finished in early 2002.</p>
        <p>Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, said that since the St. George had previously served as a single-room-occupancy hotel for the poor, she would like to see Mr. Drizin hire an outside operator for the new project.</p>
        <p>The once-elegant St. George was partly destroyed by fire in 1995. Parts of the blockwide, century-old hotel on Clark Street have been converted to co-ops and student housing.</p>
        <p>Pamela Roderick, a resident and board member at 111 Hicks Street, which abuts the site, said an independent engineer hired by her co-op had reported water leaks and possible wall buckling caused by construction. The engineer is monitoring the situation, she said, adding that the owner has been responsive to neighbors' concerns.</p>
        <p>''Some people were awakened on a Sunday morning, and we got a letter of apology saying it wouldn't happen again,'' she said. ''We actually think it will be a vast improvement on a vacant lot with weeds growing out of it and a cyclone fence.''</p>
