        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist column answers questions about buying cheap tickets to ballgame and then moving to better seats and whether supermarket should honor meat packages mislabeled at 7 cents a pound (M)</p>

        <p>My dad takes me to a lot of baseball games and always buys the cheapest tickets in the park. When the game starts, he moves to better, unoccupied seats, dragging me along. It embarrasses me. Is it O.K. for us to sit in seats we didn't pay for? -- George Murphy (age 11), Houston</p>
        <p>Your dad's seat hopping is more than O.K.; it is a time-honored baseball tradition. He hurts no one, and it would be foolish to let good seats go unused when they can bring joy to fans who'd otherwise be way out in left field.</p>

        <p>My dad takes me to a lot of baseball games and always buys the cheapest tickets in the park. When the game starts, he moves to better, unoccupied seats, dragging me along. It embarrasses me. Is it O.K. for us to sit in seats we didn't pay for? -- George Murphy (age 11), Houston</p>
        <p>Your dad's seat hopping is more than O.K.; it is a time-honored baseball tradition. He hurts no one, and it would be foolish to let good seats go unused when they can bring joy to fans who'd otherwise be way out in left field.</p>
        <p>This is not how your Houston Astros see it, however. At Enron Field all seats are reserved; you may sit only in the one you paid for. ''Latecomers don't like asking people to move out of their seats,'' explains John Sorrentino, vice president for ticket services. ''It makes them uncomfortable.'' A feeble justification. At the theater and the opera here in New York, it is customary to switch to a better, unoccupied seat. If the ticket holder arrives, he politely asks you to move, and you courteously comply. Surely Texans can do the same.</p>
        <p>But Sorrentino has another rationale. ''There tend to be different people in different seating areas,'' he says. ''If someone pays $200 for a seat, and people with $5 seats are sneaking down there, it distracts from their enjoyment.'' That is, uptown swells don't like to sit near bleacher riffraff. This view is contemptible. People from all walks of life sharing a common experience is one of the things that makes baseball our national pastime. The Astros' policy turns the amiable populism of the ballpark into a series of gated communities.</p>
        <p>Sorrentino notes that attending an Astros game is voluntary. If you choose to do so, you must follow the rules. True, but you and your dad had no say in devising those rules, and the Astros' monopoly in Houston means you have no other major-league alternatives. Civility urges us to follow the rules of the ballpark, mall or movie theater, but the rules ought to be just. They should not sacrifice the happiness of the many to the social prejudices of the few.</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate that your dad's seat changing embarrasses you. But when you are 11, nearly everything your parents do is embarrassing. So as long as you're being mortified, you might as well endure it in good seats.</p>
        <p>A sign at the supermarket said ''London Broil $2.67 a pound,'' but the actual packages were priced at $.07 a pound. I tried to buy two, but the cashier said the meat was mispriced. I think the store should honor the pricing on its packages and should have relabeled them as soon as they spotted the mistake. -- Theresa Ogden, Jersey City</p>
        <p>I don't agree. You knew perfectly well that London broil was not seven cents a pound. Taking advantage of an honest error is the improper act here. One must allow for the possibility that people make mistakes; it's what happens next that separates the ethical from the unethical.</p>
        <p>Stores, of course, may not promote a product at one price and then refuse to sell it. But what you describe is not ''bait and switch''; it's a comical foul-up. And while the store should certainly correct errors promptly, its behavior in this case suggests a doofus manager, not a moral transgression. A heads-up for the future -- General Motors does not currently produce a $3 Buick.</p>
