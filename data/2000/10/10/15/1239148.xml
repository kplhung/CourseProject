        <p>The presidential race is so agonizingly tight for both sides that it has set off a lively debate over whether Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush should dare reach for something dramatic to try to pull ahead in the next three weeks or play it safe and hope for the best on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Top strategists, politicians and party officials in both campaigns are so anxious and jittery that many of them readily acknowledge they could lose.</p>
        <p>The bloodshed in the Middle East and the tumult on Wall Street have only compounded the uncertainty, with strategists saying the contest has been buffeted by events that could enhance or harm the prospects of either candidate -- or have no impact at all.</p>
        <p>''Any false move could cost one of these guys the presidency of the United States,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey. ''The pressure must be unbearable. There's no margin for error in this race.''</p>
        <p>Richard N. Bond, a former Republican national chairman, said, ''Neither of them ought to be whistling 'Hail to the Chief' at the moment.''</p>
        <p>After weeks of seesawing polls, several surveys said the competition nationally and in swing states was too close to call. But perhaps because some polls suggest that Mr. Bush has nudged ahead after the first two debates, Democratic officials seem slightly -- just slightly -- more tense than their Republican counterparts.</p>
        <p>In fact, while many Republican officials counsel Mr. Bush to keep moving forward pressing his issues, prominent Democrats are more critical of the Gore operation. They say that Mr. Gore must be far more forceful in accentuating his accomplishments -- and his differences with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, complained that in the debates Mr. Gore did not sufficiently counter Mr. Bush's assertion that he was a uniter who would deal better with Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Mr. Gore, Mr. Kerrey said, needs to underscore his achievements on everything from the budget to trade pacts.</p>
        <p>''Gore's got to say, 'I delivered,' '' Mr. Kerrey said. ''You're saying we didn't do anything? Were you on this planet in '95 and '96? Bill Clinton and Al Gore almost got run out of the Democratic Party for working with Republicans. How about the crime bill? How about the balanced budget act? How about GATT? How about Nafta?''</p>
        <p>James Carville, an architect of President Clinton's victory in 1992, said he did not understand why either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush does not do something bold to overtake his rival. Yet Mr. Carville had no suggestions about what audacious moves either side could make.</p>
        <p>''Somebody's got to come up and grab this thing,'' he said. ''This is an election that's waiting to be won. It strikes me that the one who steps up and does something will be the winner. Both sides are paralyzed by worry.''</p>
        <p>But officials in both camps said they were nervous that any dramatic moves in this close a race could backfire -- and make it impossible for them to recover.</p>
        <p>''I come from the Green Bay Packers school of politics,'' said Tom Cole, the chief of staff for the Republican Party. ''You execute and you do it well so hopefully the other side can't stop you, though they have a pretty good idea of what's coming.'' He added, ''This is a risky time to get cute.''</p>
        <p>William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, had a similar outlook. ''If you're 10 points down or 15 points down, you've really got to throw the long bomb,'' Mr. Daley said. ''Right now this race is so close it's not about throwing the Hail Mary pass. What if you come up short?''</p>
        <p>Officials on both sides scoffed at the notion of an ''October surprise'' that could somehow help their candidate break through. Their larger concern is that the violence in the Middle East constitutes an October surprise -- not of their own making -- that could scramble the race. What is most disconcerting to advisers in both camps is that there is no way of gauging how a foreign crisis will affect the race.</p>
        <p>If attention to foreign policy continues to escalate, Mr. Gore could capitalize on his much richer foreign affairs experience and the tendency of Americans to rally behind an administration in a time of crisis. On the other hand, if voters disapprove of how the White House is handling matters of war and peace, they may turn to Mr. Bush. Republicans, after all, are rated in polls as more capable of handling foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Many Republicans and Democrats said they could not even guess how the foreign crises would play politically. ''We're in charge -- it's our guy at the White House,'' Mr. Kerrey said. ''It could help the Democrats. It could hurt the Democrats.''</p>
        <p>Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, agreed that the Middle East episodes could play many ways. But he took issue with the notion that they could unify the nation around the party that controls the White House.</p>
        <p>''It has as much risk or maybe even slightly more to hurt Al Gore,'' Mr. Engler said. ''If something does go completely haywire, it may be that the seeds were sewn long ago'' in the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>In the short term, at least, the bloodshed in the Middle East has knocked campaign news off the front pages. As a result, it may be even harder for Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush to make any breakthrough in the polls.</p>
        <p>The conflict, and Mr. Clinton's scheduled participation at a summit in Egypt on Monday, also creates uncertainties about the candidates' third and final debate on Tuesday in St. Louis. On the one hand, it could overshadow their meeting, a town-hall-style forum in which members of the audience question them. Or it could stimulate interest in the debate among voters concerned about how either candidate would handle the tensions overseas.</p>
        <p>Patrick H. Caddell, who was President Jimmy Carter's pollster, recalled the internal agonizing in the 1980 campaign -- the last time there was a contest this close this late in the season -- when the dynamic was affected by a foreign matter largely beyond the candidates' control, the Iranian hostage crisis.</p>
        <p>''You're tense, you're nervous,'' Mr. Caddell said. ''Every morning you get up and you make certain moves and you go to bed that night and nothing dramatic has happened. You can't seem to get a break.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Caddell said the Gore team must be particularly uneasy. ''I'm sure the Gore people are having a very rough time after last week,'' he said. ''They think they won the first debate, and yet everything turns sour. That has to be very debilitating.''</p>
        <p>Gore campaign officials say they feel enormous pressure because they have less to spend than the Republicans, who are spreading resources in more states. Advisers to Mr. Gore said they would decide after the St. Louis debate whether to give up on some major states -- Ohio and Louisiana are among the possibilities -- and pump resources elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''Because the race is so close, you feel pressure within the campaign to open up, break out,'' said Tad Devine, a Gore strategist. ''You feel pressure from institutions that are supporting you. You feel pressure from individual states to make decisions about scheduling and resource allocation.''</p>
        <p>Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top strategist, said he did not feel such pressure. ''We have the resources and the volunteer enthusiasm to conduct an aggressive air and ground game in all the battleground states and then some,'' he said. Mr. Rove said he did not expect either candidate to break ahead in the polls until the end. ''The people who are left out there, available to both sides, are going to move begrudgingly,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Democrats seemed more distressed than Republicans about their candidate, particularly after the second debate. Many said that the vice president, troubled that he came across as imperious in the first debate, was too timid in the second one. ''I'd have to give Bush the points,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said after the second debate. ''Gore was off his game a little because of the criticism he took in the first debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli said he was worried that Mr. Gore might be too afraid to shoot back at Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore, in particular, needs to change the dynamic of the race,'' he said. ''Bush has succeeded in convincing people that there are only marginal differences on issues. I know this has been a few difficult weeks for Al Gore, but it's critical that he not lose his confidence. He has to be aggressive. That's the only means of winning.''</p>
        <p>Even for those who give Mr. Bush the edge in the second debate, that benefit may be fleeting because coverage was eclipsed by the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engler did acknowledge that a self-inflicted wound could happen on the Republican side. ''Anybody in a campaign is subject to some horrific gaffe,'' he said, ''something completely out of left field.''</p>
        <p>But people in both parties also said the race could turn on mechanical factors, like which party is most successful in prodding voters to the polls. Senator Durbin, for one, recalled a recent conversation he had with Mr. Gore: ''I said that my experience tells me something very good and something very bad is going to happen to you before the election, and that I hope the good thing is better than the bad. He said, 'I paid a lot of dues to get here.' I said, 'I know, but some things are out of your control. This could all change in a heartbeat.' ''</p>
