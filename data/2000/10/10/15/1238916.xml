        <p>He's a streetwise 14-year-old with a penchant for trouble. She's a sophisticated 15-year-old whose life's ambition is to set him straight.</p>
        <p>What's that spell? Sibling rivalry, of course. And it's at the heart of Nickelodeon's newest comedy series, ''Noah Knows Best'' (Saturdays at 8:30 p.m.), starring Phillip Glenn Van Dyke as Noah Beznick (in New York T-shirt) ad Rachel Roth as his sister, Megan (in lavender shirt).</p>
        <p>''The great thing about 'Noah' is that we have a male character's point of view in navigating this aspirational time in kids' lives,'' said Cyma Zarghami, executive vice president and general manager of Nickelodeon. ''He gets himself into serious trouble, but only with family and friends. And he uses both mischief and humor to connect with Nick's older 'tween' viewers.''</p>
        <p>Set on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, ''Noah Knows Best'' centers on the rocky relationship between Noah and Megan, as mediated by their father, a theater producer, and their mother, a drama professor.</p>
        <p>Their battlegrounds are Noah's prestigious public school, Megan's snooty private school and their mutual after-hours pizza joint, where their conflicts often spill over into their inner circle of friends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van Dyke thinks he and his character have a lot in common. ''We both like to have a good time, and sometimes it can be a problem in that we tend to slack off,'' he said. But there are differences. ''He's more boisterous, more outgoing. He can control a room and he's very good with people.''</p>
        <p>That boisterousness can land Noah in hot water, as he finds his footing in an environment where popularity counts, perhaps too much. But when push comes to shove, he knows where he can turn.</p>
        <p>That would be home, said Marcia Strassman, whom parents may recognize from the 1970's sitcom ''Welcome Back, Kotter,'' Ms. Strassman, who plays Noah's mother, sees the show's strong point as that of teacher -- to children and parents alike.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the show is about kids learning lessons from their mistakes,'' she said. ''They're not perfect kids, but they work things out. And the fact is that yeah, we are parents on this show but we talk to them and listen to them and that's the most important thing.''</p>
        <p>''A big problem today is that our kids feel they're not heard,'' she added. ''We're teaching viewers that adults can listen, though they cannot always tell you what you want to hear.''</p>
