        <p>Mr. Schaefer, whose one-hour program of eclectic music, ''New Sounds,'' is heard every night at 11 on WNYC-FM (93.9), recently experienced his own moment of aural archaeology while taping music amid the ruins of Volubilis, a first-century Roman city in Morocco. The occasion was the Fez Festival of World Sacred Music, and Mr. Schaefer was huddled over a tape recorder at the ruins while the Ensemble Organum, a French medieval music group, and the Moroccan Sufi brotherhood Ensemble El Assala collaborated on an ancient Mozarabic chant from Moorish Spain.</p>

        <p>IT'S been said that the physicist and radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi harbored hopes of inventing a device to capture and amplify the faint but theoretically still resonant residue of historic sounds, and that his own wish was to hear Jesus delivering the Sermon on the Mount. That's the kind of dream John Schaefer can appreciate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaefer, whose one-hour program of eclectic music, ''New Sounds,'' is heard every night at 11 on WNYC-FM (93.9), recently experienced his own moment of aural archaeology while taping music amid the ruins of Volubilis, a first-century Roman city in Morocco. The occasion was the Fez Festival of World Sacred Music, and Mr. Schaefer was huddled over a tape recorder at the ruins while the Ensemble Organum, a French medieval music group, and the Moroccan Sufi brotherhood Ensemble El Assala collaborated on an ancient Mozarabic chant from Moorish Spain.</p>
        <p>''These guys are dressed in white robes and they're performing under an arch -- the only structure still standing except for a couple of temple columns with storks nesting on top,'' Mr. Schaefer recalls. ''They're singing this music and it's hard to tell what tradition it's coming from. Is it old medieval Christian? Is it Sufi? It was really quite extraordinary.'' Mr. Schaefer, who left the festival wondering if he hadn't heard a recreation of the first world music, taped everything.</p>
        <p>In late September, ''New Sounds'' broadcast some of the results of Mr. Schaefer's musical expedition, including religious music from South India, Algeria, Greece and Indonesia as well as Jewish poems in Hebrew and Arabic and a performance by Kurdish dervishes. Yet despite this trove of original recordings, world and ethnic music is just one musical path down which the show wanders. Although Mr. Schaefer, 41, often touches on some of music's most ancient traditions, his 18 years at the helm of ''New Sounds'' have been about sifting through music's present, making connections between seemingly disparate styles and questioning assumptions about what constitutes ''serious'' music. And along the way, ''New Sounds'' has become an unusually important outlet for many of New York's most adventurous musicians.</p>
        <p>On any given night, listeners may hear minimalism, jazz, rock, new age, ambient, process, electronic or folk music -- or they may hear all of them. One recent program highlighted modern compositions based on the ending of the Beatles'  ''Strawberry Fields Forever''; another, built around the South African song ''Wemoway,'' featured versions by Brian Eno and the rock group They Might Be Giants as well as the Weavers. A single show can feature Hank Williams, gamelan, Laurie Anderson and a singer creating overtones in a cistern -- all somehow tied together through a theme. Sometimes, the ''theme'' is the thinnest of excuses for Mr. Schaefer to play some of his favorite recordings; other times, it can be something as simultaneously esoteric and enlightening as the similarities between traditional Balinese music and the layered rhythms of recent minimalist compositions.</p>
        <p>''Ancient Indian music, medieval music from a German monastery -- these are still new sounds to most people who are listening to the radio,'' Mr. Schaefer says. ''They also have very close ties to the modern music scene; for example, a lot of the same singers who were doing the early music were in Steve Reich's ensemble. One of the things I like about the term 'new music' is that you can define it any way you want. It's like that famous quote about pornography: I just know it when I hear it.''</p>
        <p>MR. SCHAEFER'S tastes and knowledge seem boundless, and his honesty, vitality and openness to the scene he chronicles have made ''New Sounds'' a part of that world in a way that no other program is. Aside from highlighting new and important recordings by artists who might otherwise fall into the programming gulf between classical and popular radio, ''New Sounds'' produces and broadcasts its own live concert series, features in-studio performances, broadcasts private recordings of works in progress and has commissioned works from Mr. Reich, Jocelyn Pook, Derek Bermel, Ralph Towner, Jerome Kitzke, Richard Einhorn and other composers.</p>
        <p>''For we who live in New York to have him in the position he's in at the radio station, that's amazing,'' says the composer Philip Glass, who will be co-presenting two concerts with Mr. Schaefer and ''New Sounds'' at Merkin Hall in May. ''There are very few professional music people -- not only musicians, but writers about music -- who you can really truly say have an open, expansive horizon. And he does.</p>
        <p>''John's special quality is being able to find the value and uniqueness of music regardless of its geographical, historic or ethnic tradition. He simply can cut through all of that and he goes to the essential function of music, which is about communication and feeling and reflecting culture. And John is a peerless judge of this music -- it's not all the same. It's like every other kind of music: there are better players and not-so-good players. He's cultivated that kind of discrimination over a very wide band of music.''</p>
        <p>WHILE the show's widely cast net captures a varied universe of musicians, it's the musical adventurers eager to sail a variety of waters who turn up most frequently. The jazz clarinetist Don Byron, for example, has released recordings exploring avant-garde jazz, klezmer, soundtracks from early animated films and music inspired by the 1970's funk band Mandrill -- and all of those projects have found a home on ''New Sounds.'' Likewise, the New York guitarist Gary Lucas has performed on ''New Sounds'' both solo and with his power trio Gods and Monsters, playing original compositions as well as traditional Jewish music, Wagner transcriptions and songs by the blues legend Robert Johnson.</p>
        <p>''It sounds self-serving to say he's got great taste, but I find that if I tune the show in randomly, there's always something that compels me to listen,'' Mr. Lucas says. ''And as a musician, I can count on one hand the number of people in the profession who have stood up for me over the years. John Schaefer is one of them.'' Mr. Lucas adds that a recent performance on one of the show's live concert broadcasts led to a soundtrack commission.</p>
        <p>Another composer and performer who has come to rely on ''New Sounds'' is Dick Connett, and like Mr. Lucas, he has found Mr. Schaefer open to any musical twist his work takes. ''If I had to pick one person who has understood and followed my music most closely, it's John Schaefer,'' Mr. Connett says. Indeed, when he first approached Mr. Schaefer in 1985, Mr. Connett was writing structurally based abstract compositions for small chamber ensembles under the name A. Leroy. Today, he and the vocalist Sonya Cohen record modern compositions based on such classic American folk songs as ''Lost in the Pines'' and ''Casey Jones'' as the group Last Forever -- and their development has been eagerly chronicled by ''New Sounds.''</p>
        <p>''Every which way I turn, John's already there,'' Mr. Connett says. ''I mean, it was almost like he had preceded me and was waiting for it. He's followed Last Forever since its very inception: he played demo tapes and solo piano tapes starting around '87 and for five years gave me a chance to play this stuff on the radio and in live concerts as it was being developed. There was a real feeling of celebration when the record came out; it was something that he was definitely a part of. Because before the album's release you couldn't hear it anywhere but John's show.''</p>
        <p>Digging for those new sounds requires a lot of work, as Mr. Schaefer's small and chaotic office at WNYC's studios in the Municipal Building in Lower Manhattan attests. With the exception of a desk and a few chairs, it is filled entirely by compact discs, either stacked willy-nilly or spilling out of boxes. For Mr. Schaefer, the wealth of material he has to work with is in stark contrast to the way things were when he began the show 18 years ago.</p>
        <p>''The big change in the music scene has been that there's a lot more of it,'' he says. '' 'New Sounds' went on the air in September of '82, but I started putting the show together in March. It took me six months just to get the music so I wouldn't have to do it out of my own record collection -- which I ended up doing anyway. It was hard tracking this stuff down. Now I can't keep up with it.''</p>
        <p>A Queens native who grew up near Aqueduct Racetrack and developed a passion for horse racing -- his family's summer vacations are spent at Saratoga -- Mr. Schaefer attended Fordham University, where he was the programming director at WFUV-FM. After an unhappy year at a commercial classical station in Portland, Me., he returned to New York and joined WNYC around the same time that the station was hiring Steve Post, the iconoclastic host of ''Morning Music,'' and Tim Page, who subsequently became a Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic for The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>''Tim was interviewing people like Elliot Carter and playing Steve Reich and Philip Glass and I thought: 'Man, this is a really progressive place. But as long as we've gone this far, why not go farther?' '' Mr. Schaefer says. ''I believed there might be a chance to play some stuff that was even a little further removed from the classical canon but was serious music and deserved to be heard. In those days, people like Laurie Anderson, Brian Eno, Harold Budd and John Adams didn't get much airplay. These were people whose music I'd stumbled on and thought was interesting and had real substance to it. Pop music stations wouldn't touch it and no classical stations considered it classical music. And that's basically what 'New Sounds' was. The first shows were on Friday and Saturday nights, from 11 p.m. until 2 a.m., so the station's risk was absolutely zero because there was nothing happening. I mean, at 11 every night, we would play chamber music. And at 11 every night, WQXR and WNCN played chamber music. It was just ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>A popular syndicated program -- it has been carried in Australia and Taiwan and was offered by National Public Radio for 11 years until the 1996 cuts in National Endowment for the Arts financing forced NPR to drop all of its acquired programming -- ''New Sounds'' is now available on the Internet (www.wnyc.org) and NPR has expressed interest in reacquiring the show. For Mr. Schaefer, the biggest surprise has been finding out how wide the audience for the music he plays is.</p>
        <p>''I thought that this would be a show for people like me who had grown up on rock music, had begun to realize there was a lot of great other music out there and were really sick of hearing All Things Springsteen on WNEW-FM and virtually nothing else anywhere else on the dial,'' he says. ''So I thought we'd be getting in a mostly younger audience of disaffected rockers. To my surprise -- and everyone's surprise -- we started getting letters from retired people. I got a letter very early on from a guy who said that a Japanese record I'd played by Osamu Kitajima had touched him more deeply than anything since Caruso. This guy had been listening to the radio and WNYC for 60 years, and he was no disaffected rocker. I don't know what it is about architects, but it seems like every other letter I get is on an architect's letterhead. And a lot of artists write in and say, 'I have your show on while I'm in my studio at night.' One guy invited me to his show in SoHo and all his paintings were named for pieces he'd heard on 'New Sounds.' And they were really good, too.''</p>
