        <p>''WE may wind up with the budget fixed, but the county won't work,'' the Nassau County parks and recreation commissioner, John B. Kiernan, quipped as he looked at a list of 56 people in his office -- including himself -- who took an early retirement incentive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiernan is among the 506 county employees taking advantage of an early retirement incentive offered by the state to all municipal employees statewide in an effort to reduce a county budget deficit estimated at $80 million for 2001 and $380 million by 2004.</p>

        <p>''WE may wind up with the budget fixed, but the county won't work,'' the Nassau County parks and recreation commissioner, John B. Kiernan, quipped as he looked at a list of 56 people in his office -- including himself -- who took an early retirement incentive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiernan is among the 506 county employees taking advantage of an early retirement incentive offered by the state to all municipal employees statewide in an effort to reduce a county budget deficit estimated at $80 million for 2001 and $380 million by 2004.</p>
        <p>Under the state retirement incentive, employees with more than 5 years of service and older than 55, or 10 years of service and older than 50, receive one-month credit of time served for every year of service, up to three years, for purposes of pension calculation. On top of that, the state is adding to the pensions of the most senior municipal employees an extra one-month credit for every year of service, up to two years.</p>
        <p>In August, the county offered a lump-sum severance package worth between $6,000 and $8,500, depending on length of service. It that attracted 60 employees. The combined loss of 566 employees in a county work force of 9,832 -- excluding the police department and Nassau Community College -- represents a loss of nearly 6 percent.</p>
        <p>''I think it's devastating,'' said Mr. Kiernan, noting that countywide, 14 commissioners and department heads are jumping ship.</p>
        <p>''When I was first appointed 11 years ago, we had a staff of 888 people,'' Mr. Kiernan said of the Parks and Recreation Department. ''With these retirements and proposed layoffs, we'll be down to 220 -- one fourth what we had when I assumed office. I have been told they will not be filling any of the positions except my own. We have people leaving who started here right out of high school and are now 60. I'm losing a tremendous amount of supervisory people, including the head of the Eisenhower Park grounds maintenance, who has been here 38 or 39 years, and his assistant, who has been here 20 years. The institutional memory walking out of the county is incredible.''</p>
        <p>The presiding officer of the county Legislature, Judith A. Jacobs, labeled the exodus a ''brain drain.''</p>
        <p>''Years of knowledge is walking out the door,'' said Ms. Jacobs, a Woodbury Democrat. ''We have a major crisis in Nassau County government.</p>
        <p>''Government is supposed to deliver a quality of life that includes public works and parks and services to our children, seniors and mentally ill,'' she said. ''Not only are the top people with their experience leaving, but the proposed budget calls for 350 layoffs of the people who deliver the services. People don't want to see Nassau County services go down the drain.''</p>
        <p>The county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, was unavailable for comment, but Ms. Jacobs said the Legislature plans to vote on a budget on Thursday that will seek to preserve the services residents expect. She said that rather than the proposed $33-a-year tax increase proposed by Mr. Gulotta, the Democratic majority in the Legislature is considering a tax increase of $78 to $100 next year. With such an increase, she said, ''the county would be taking a very big step toward the recovery process.''</p>
        <p>The Nassau Interim Finance Authority, appointed by Governor Pataki to oversee a $105 million state bailout of the county, would then review the budget. If it finds it unworkable, it has the power to assume control of the county's operations.</p>
        <p>But nothing will bring back the people who are retiring today.</p>
        <p>Concern about a possible takeover by the outside monitors has led some people to retire, according to James E. Picken, who for nearly 30 years has been the county's consumer affairs commissioner. He said the uncertainty did not figure in his decision to retire, but that he knows some people who were uncertain about ''what path the board might follow.</p>
        <p>''You want to see your office through the difficult times, but I think it's time for me to go,'' said Mr. Picken, 63. ''I do it regretfully.''</p>
        <p>Todd Goldfarb, the county's personnel director, said that questions about how much the county would save from the early retirements could not be answered until it completed a review of each position vacated and made a decision on whether to fill it with a lower-salaried employee or eliminate it altogether.</p>
        <p>He also said that Mr. Gulotta has recommended to the county Legislature that a number of departments merge as part of his cost-cutting measures. The proposal calls for the following mergers:</p>
        <p>*The Youth Board into the Department of Social Services.</p>
        <p>*The Women's Services Department into the Family Resources Department.</p>
        <p>*The Department of General Services and the Office of Cultural Development into the Department of Parks and Recreation.</p>
        <p>*The Office of Affirmative Action into the Department of Public Works.</p>
        <p>*The Office of Labor Relations into the Department of Personnel/County Attorney.</p>
        <p>*The Department of Drug and Alcohol Addiction and the Department of Mental Health into the Department of Health.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said that ''some of the mergers don't make sense'' and that the Legislature would consider altering some them. She said, for instance, that merging the Youth Board and the Department of Social Services would mean the county would lose the state and federal funding the Youth Board now gets.</p>
        <p>''We would lose more than we would gain,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The county's commissioner of senior citizens affairs, Rena Iacono, another retiree, said she did not believe ''any of us would be retiring if there weren't a need. The circumstances of the county created a need, and the retirement incentive gave us a clear solution.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Iacono said she stood to retire with another 4 1/2 years worth of credit. So though she is retiring after 29 years, her pension will be based upon 33 1/2 years of service.</p>
        <p>Ms. Iacono, 58, said that appointed officials had been working at a reduced salary because of the county's financial crisis.</p>
        <p>''Longevity benefits and a county car have been taken away while union people got raises,'' she said. ''You are told you are doing a great job but you have to continue doing it for less. I look at my salary, and I'm making what I made in 1996. That's not fair.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Iacono said she knew it was a ''difficult time in the county and I hope that in a minuscule way my retirement is helping. I hope also that someone will succeed me who is dedicated, has a strong background, will work well with the staff and provide the leadership that is necessary to keep the programs growing.''</p>
        <p>Ann M. Irvin, 66, executive director of the Youth Board, said she felt guilty about retiring.</p>
        <p>''I wish I didn't have to go right now because something that I think is so important to people is in great jeopardy,'' she said, alluding to major cuts to the Youth Board's budget. ''But I know that financially I can't afford not to retire at this stage of my life. Suppose a year from now I didn't get these incentives.''</p>
        <p>The Youth Board's budget was halved this year, from $8.6 million to $4.3 million. The county Legislature restored $800,000 in June and recommended that another $2.5 million be added next year, but Mr. Gulotta eliminated it in his proposed 2001 budget.</p>
        <p>''You can't get the work done or fulfill the mission with greatly diminished resources,'' Ms. Irvin said. ''So when you look at these incentives and what is happening in the county, it's time for me to go.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Irvin, the Youth Board's executive director since 1972 and a county employee since 1965, said that during the recession in 1992, ''I lost 60 percent of my staff, which I never regained, and my salary was rolled back by 5 percent to what I was making in 1990. Three or four years later, the 5 percent was put back, but not retroactively. We got another raise last July of 5 percent, but that was taken away in January.''</p>
        <p>She said that when she sat down with her financial adviser in the spring, ''we reviewed my finances and the county's financial situation and decided that I might never have the opportunity I have now to make up for some of the salary rollbacks of the 90's. Instead of getting credit for 36 years of service, I will walk away with 40 1/2 years of service.''</p>
        <p>The county employee with the longest service is Leslie Lukash, the chief medical examiner since 1957, who became a county employee in 1950 when he joined the staff of Meadowbrook Hospital, now the Nassau County Medical Center.</p>
        <p>''I think when you reach 50 years of service that it's time to turn the reins over to someone else,'' said Dr. Lukash, who turns 80 on Oct. 25. ''But I have mixed emotions. In one sense I should leave because of my age, but I should stay because I am healthy and my cognitive ability is intact.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lukash said the retirement incentive would tack another three years onto his pension.</p>
        <p>Agnes Sanders, 52, said she decided to retire now after 20 years in the General Services Department because the incentive would give her the same pension she would have received if she had worked another three years.</p>
        <p>Asked if she had encountered any employees upset with the large number of retirees, fearing they might be asked to work harder because of a reduced staff, Ms. Sanders insisted: ''Nobody is disgruntled. You can do only so much in an eight-hour day.''</p>
        <p>In addition to those taking the early retirement incentives, there are the normal number of employees who leave for other jobs. One of them, Edward J. Grilli, 48, has served as District Attorney Denis Dillon's spokesman for the last 22 years. He plans to leave Nov. 6 to become chief of staff to Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority.</p>
        <p>''He approached me with the offer,'' Mr. Grilli said.</p>
        <p>He said he was not old enough to take advantage of the early retirement offer, but ''we will lose more than 10 percent of our overall staff -- about 30 people -- including assistant district attorneys, investigators and secretaries. So it's really hitting us hard. But it's not just us, it's everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grilli said so many people were retiring that people were running from one farewell party to the next.</p>
        <p>''It's been a boon to the catering facilities in the Mineola area,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanders said she ''went to the Purchasing Department retirement party Wednesday night for six people from that department. The mailman was among them. He was here almost 35 years. The director was also retiring after 20 years. Together, the six added up to close to 200 years of service. The men are taking it harder than the women because a lot of them are young and are leaving because they think this will be the last incentive.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Irvin said she too was running to different retirement parties.</p>
        <p>''I feel it's kind of silly,'' she said with a laugh. ''They should have just rented out the Coliseum.''</p>
