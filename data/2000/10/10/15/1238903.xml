        <p>THREE judges held up their goblets, sniffed the bouquet, and sipped. And the winner was: the well water from Independence Village, an elderly housing complex in Montville.</p>
        <p>''I was quite flabbergasted, actually,'' said Carol Lathrop, the operations manager for the apartments whose water supply won the National Rural Water Association's water tasting contest in Washington, D.C. in May. It beat out hundreds of contestants from around the country.</p>
        <p>Independence Village's distinction may have proved that good water does not have to percolate from a remote alpine spring. The apartments were built in the late 1970's in the Uncasville section of this southeastern Connecticut town. They are a half-mile west of a major highway, Interstate 395. Their dead-end loop road, off the well-traveled Maple Avenue, is more suburban than rural. A gas-fired power plant and a corrugated box factory operate about two miles to the southeast.</p>
        <p>These landmarks mean little to water quality, in fact, because the well at Independence Village lies upstream, in terms of groundwater movement, of the industry. What does matter is that the well that serves 55 residents is 360 feet deep -- very deep by drinking water standards. The deeper the well, the better chances of good water.</p>
        <p>The water has a neutral pH of about 7.4, Ms. Lathrop said. ''That usually means you're not transferring anything,'' she said. It has passed the required government water health tests for many years, according to Ms. Lathrop and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. It doesn't need chlorine.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lathrop had never heard of the national contest before a staffer of the Atlantic States Rural Water and Wastewater Association mentioned it while he was out checking equipment at Independence Village last spring. To their surprise, the village's water was named the best nondisinfected water in the Connecticut competition in Mystic, and before they knew it, the judges were gathering to sip at the national contest.</p>
        <p>The winning well, firmly within the Thames River Valley, is just two-tenths of a mile away from a tributary called Oxoboxo Brook. This brook bulges into mill ponds a few times as it works its way southeast through Uncasville on its way to the Thames River.</p>
        <p>Independence Village won a contest judged by people who consider water quality standards for a living. One of the judges was Robert Blanco, an engineer who has managed drinking water policies for the Environmental Protection Agency for many years. Mr. Blanco now is an adviser to the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators.</p>
        <p>Joining him were Carrie Apostolou, a United States Senate Appropriations Committee staff member in charge of Environmental Protection Agency funding, and John Romano, assistant administrator for rural utilities for the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romano said it's hard to describe what makes some water taste really good. Ms. Lathrop, asked to describe her water, said it has a ''faintly sweet taste, but not like sugary sweet.''</p>
        <p>An easier task, Mr. Blanco said, is to pinpoint what makes some water taste bad. Earthy water with a lot of particles won't win a contest, he suggested. Neither will heavily chlorinated water, because many people don't like the smell or taste.</p>
        <p>The taste test could never take the place of the bacteria and chemical screenings that water systems must undergo regularly for government agencies. Water could taste delicious, Mr. Blanco said, but still make you sick.</p>
        <p>The final stage of the contest pitted the Independence Village water against community water systems from Wisconsin, Ohio, West Virginia, and Idaho. Mr. Blanco said the judges struggled to pick a winner.</p>
        <p>The judges swirled, smelled, and drank the water from hotel-style water goblets. They didn't know which water was which. They gave number grades in categories such as bouquet, clarity, and taste, and then just added up the numbers. Independence Village squeaked past the others.</p>
        <p>''I think it was a matter of one or two points between No. 1 and No. 2,'' Mr. Blanco said. ''All of the five samples were excellent. I can't tell you that we all agreed on each factor.''</p>
