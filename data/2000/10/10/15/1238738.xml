        <p>To listen to Al Gore and George W. Bush, you'd think this election represents a clash between radically different visions of what the federal government will spend money on in the years ahead. Gore seems to want to throw new cash everywhere -- preschools, teacher salaries, personal savings accounts. Bush, by contrast, pledges a government that trusts ''real people,'' not Washington bureaucrats, to do what's best with their money.</p>
        <p>What both men know but won't discuss is that despite their avowed priorities, the vast bulk of today's $1.8 trillion federal budget is already spoken for -- and that before long, what little discretion a president has to leave his thumbprint on the federal beast will shrink toward zero.</p>
        <p>Federal spending, in short, is already so big (and fixed) relative to either man's aspirations that even their boldest proposals merely tinker at the margins. Bush's ''risky'' tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years, for example, comes to roughly 5 percent of projected revenues over that period. Al Gore says he'll mount a ''revolution'' in education with a 3 percent bump in national school spending.</p>
        <p>Presidents are doomed to nibble at the edges because of a fiscal fact most campaigns ignore. For all the moans about ''big government,'' just seven items make up 75 percent of what Uncle Sam does: Social Security ($403 billion a year), Medicare ($199 billion), Medicaid ($117 billion), military and civil-service pensions ($79 billion), defense ($294 billion) and interest on the debt ($220 billion). Toss in a few smaller entitlement programs and you've covered all but one-sixth of federal outlays.</p>
        <p>And it's only going to get tighter. With the exception of Pentagon spending and the debt, all of these categories grow automatically, though ''grow'' may be the wrong word. Once 76 million baby boomers start hitting their rocking chairs a decade from now, the costs of their health and retirement programs will explode. The federal dollars not devoted to entitlements and defense will slip from a level that is already lower relative to the size of the economy than at any time since bean counters started tracking such things in 1962.</p>
        <p>The paradox is that the leftover spending, the so-called domestic discretionary functions, is what most Americans tend to think of as ''government'': border cops, college loans, cancer research, air-traffic controllers, inspectors who make sure the food on the shelves won't poison us, the construction crews that expand highways gripped by gridlock.</p>
        <p>The math is simple: unless Americans develop a taste for big new taxes, or politicians trim entitlements, there won't be money for government to do much it's not already doing.</p>
        <p>It wasn't always thus. Back in the early 1960's, when Social Security was in its youth and Medicare didn't exist, the bulk of federal spending went for those items subject to yearly Congressional review. Today the ratios have reversed: 7 in 10 dollars go instead for mandatory spending, payments made automatically to citizens we've said are entitled to them. Meanwhile, the more optional National Park Service ($1.4 billion), F.B.I. ($3 billion), U.S. Border Patrol ($1 billion), Head Start ($5 billion) and aid for poor schoolchildren ($9 billion) together add up to a penny on the federal dollar.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, likes to say the new economy is ''lighter'' than the old, weighing less per dollar of gross domestic product, as software has become more essential than steel. It's the same with new government: highways, dams and research laboratories have lost their primacy; cold cash -- for pensions, doctors and hospitals -has taken over. Call it government by A.T.M.: you walk up, hit the buttons and the cash to which you're entitled pops out. Ask not what you can do for your country, my friends, but what cash your country can dole out to you.</p>
        <p>The transformation of government from road builder to check writer was not a historical accident. It was a deliberate effort, on the part of Congress and voters, too, to use the nation's postwar affluence to fashion a more secure safety net. The shift, necessitating a boost in federal domestic spending from 6 percent to 15 percent of gross domestic product (G.D.P.) between the end of the Korean War and the late 1970's, was the product of what Gene Steuerle of the Urban Institute calls ''the era of easy finance.''</p>
        <p>Defense spending declined swiftly after Korea, leaving a peace dividend that could be deployed elsewhere. Social Security payroll taxes rose 3 percent each decade with little public complaint, mainly because early beneficiaries hadn't paid into the system for long and thus received far more in benefits than they contributed. Finally, the combination of inflation and tax brackets that weren't adjusted for it enabled government revenue to quietly grow faster than the economy. This was a dream world for politicians; they could expand benefits and cut taxes. The idea that this might eventually cause trouble for an aging society was a problem for another day.</p>
        <p>Not that we should come down too hard on yesterday's politicians for lacking foresight; they accomplished a great deal. The results of government by A.T.M. have been impressive: Social Security has nearly eradicated elderly poverty; Medicare has brought security to old age. But as the hungry A.T.M. gobbles up the budget, the costs are becoming clear. Bill Clinton came to office eight years ago pledging big spending boosts for infrastructure, education and research and development. Yet such public investments, which dropped from 2.6 percent of G.D.P. two decades ago to 1.8 percent by 1992, have fallen to 1.6 percent on Clinton's watch.</p>
        <p>These numbers translate into tangible losses citizens can see and feel. The national parks budget has declined by 10 percent in inflation-adjusted terms since the early 1980's, for example, at a time when park visits and the number of sites in the system are up 25 percent. At Yellowstone, families pay $20-a-car entry fees for the privilege of dodging potholes. Highways are so clogged that the average annual delay faced by big-city drivers has risen to 50 hours from 34 a decade ago. And has anyone seen a major airport or inner-city school lately that doesn't look run-down?</p>
        <p>Before this decade is out, the A.T.M. juggernaut could well inspire the next great overhaul of American politics. ''We don't want to have a government that is consumed only with passing out money,'' says John Kasich, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, ''and where all the discretionary programs, whether it's the National Institutes of Health or higher education, basically get eliminated. That's not an acceptable proposition.''</p>
        <p>It is, however, the current plan.</p>
        <p>There are a trillion things to know about government spending, but connoisseurs like to savor a few choice morsels. For starters, federal spending as a percentage of G.D.P., which economists say is the best measure of the size of government, is the lowest it has been in decades.</p>
        <p>Spending hovered between 21 and 23 percent of G.D.P. under presidents Reagan and Bush. Thanks to economic growth and spending restraint, spending has more recently declined to 18.7 percent and is headed toward 16 percent. The least understood fiscal fact of our time is that Clinton was coaxed into balancing the budget downward. If we were still spending at Reagan-Bush levels, government would have roughly $300 billion a year more to play with -- enough for seven new departments of education, say, or a shiny new Pentagon. Instead, after two terms, a ''liberal'' president still can't lift Pell grants back to the value they had in the 1970's, or shake loose a few extra billion to fully fund Head Start.</p>
        <p>This is due, in part, to the rhetorical power of big numbers. In a country as large as the United States, the tiniest federal program quickly adds up to billions of dollars. When politicians and newspaper editorialists start throwing around these figures, it's easy to scare voters and kill off even the most reasonable, budget-conscious proposals. The budget hawks' zeal tends to vary inversely with the size of the program under attack. Zeroing out the perennially suspect National Endowment for the Arts and its $98 million budget, for example, would finance the Pentagon for three hours. Foreign aid, at 1 percent of spending, comes to three weeks' interest on the debt. Before the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, think how many of the nation's problems were pinned on the 1 percent of federal spending that went to the 2 percent of Americans known as welfare mothers. With a little political grandstanding, the most insignificant federal outlay can be made to look like runaway government.</p>
        <p>Then, of course, there's pork, scorned by most right-thinking people as all that's wrong with our political system. The amplest tallies of these dubious local projects are $10 billion a year -- a fortune to ordinary mortals, but half a penny on the dollar for the feds. A little pork goes a long way to grease the wheels in Congress. One congressman's waste, after all, is another's hometown jobs program. Suppose a few billion dollars in repaved roads or silly research grants help seal the deal that one day makes our pension costs sustainable. Will anyone object all that strenuously if the price of national solvency includes the Robert Byrd Judicial Center or the Orrin Hatch Memorial Exit Ramp?</p>
        <p>Puny programs aside, few officials in either party ever propose cutting ''big government'' at all. Democrats, for example, have all but abandoned calls for defense cuts. Their timidity makes sense if you stress, as Republicans do, that Pentagon spending has come down from 6 percent of G.D.P. at the height of the Reagan buildup to 3 percent of G.D.P. today. But frame the same issue another way: should we still give the Pentagon 90 percent of its average cold war funding a decade after the end of the cold war? Thanks to steady economic growth, both of these facts are true. But as the current campaign reminds us, such analysis is beside the point, since Pentagon budgeting is mainly a political exercise. Democrats call for hikes to avoid being tagged soft on defense, while Republicans pretend their insistence on a few pennies more proves Democrats are unfit for world leadership.</p>
        <p>Those ''radical'' Republican plans to scrap entire cabinet agencies back in Newt Gingrich's heyday were similarly hollow. Take the education department, where malignant bureaucrats ''in sandals and beads'' were said to be destroying the nation's schools. In reality, the handful of programs that make up the bulk of the Education Department's $38 billion budget have had broad bipartisan support for years. Loan subsidies and Pell grants, totaling about $12 billion a year, make college affordable for millions of young Americans. Subsidies of about $15 billion help local districts teach poor or disabled children. Salaries and expenses for the department's 5,000 employees come to a little over 1 percent of its budget. No doubt we should have fired these hippies years ago. But how would that change a single thing that ails our schools? Republicans could justifiably argue that a separate cabinet agency wasn't needed to administer the big education programs, which existed before the department was set up. But that means Republicans were really peddling a kind of neutron-bomb education reform -- blow up the agency, yes, but for heaven's sake, keep everything it does intact. Similar sleight of hand explains why Republican plans to kill the departments of commerce and energy would have left 80 percent of the spending untouched.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, even the fiercest Republican revolutionaries don't speak of cutting big social programs like Medicare, only of slowing their growth. Around election time, Democrats get red in the face and insist these measures are an abomination; in the intervening years, they endorse similar restraints themselves. Since most of these funds go to senior citizens, the feds now spend seven times more on every American over 65 ($17,688) than on each child under 18 ($2,491). That gap will only widen. The fact that state and local governments take the lead on school spending dilutes but doesn't alter the deep gray shade of American public finance. ''Boomers of every political stripe once tended to be idealistic about what government should be doing,'' says Steuerle of the Urban Institute. ''Now it turns out that the bequest we may leave our children is a federal government whose sole purpose is our own consumption in retirement.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, even before the boomers retire, the A.T.M. juggernaut chugs along with enormous power. This year, for example, without anyone debating or voting on it, spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, fueled by automatic hikes for inflation and rising medical costs, will soar by $45 billion; at the same time, President Clinton will be lucky to secure an extra $450 million to help schools reduce class size.</p>
        <p>So far, we've covered only the government's official spending. Plenty of de facto spending gets done under the guise of tax subsidies, the back door to the A.T.M. Tax breaks for mortgage interest payments and employer-provided health care, for example, come to roughly $150 billion a year. Because tax deductions are worth more to people in higher tax brackets, such policies perversely shower bigger subsidies on citizens the richer they are. These subsidies will quietly rise by another $50 billion over the next five years. ''Elect me,'' the subtitles under both a Bush and Gore stump speech could well read, ''and I'll hike health and housing subsidies for millionaires, while renters and the uninsured fend for themselves.'' As Joe Lieberman might say, ''Is this a great country, or what?''</p>
        <p>It's important to be precise about the nature of the threat posed by government's A.T.M. Cries that the coming surge in health and pension costs will saddle workers with tax hikes and sink their standard of living became popular a few years ago, along with the inevitable backlash against such Gen-X ''whining.'' The real risks are subtler. While few experts would deny that the boomers' golden years will place a burden on the young, most also say that steady economic growth will boost incomes substantially higher than they are today. The richest nation on earth can plainly afford the baby boom's retirement. The thornier question is whether Americans will agree to leave room for government to spend money on anything else. If not, the federal government will start looking like a family that pulls the kids out of college, lets the house fall apart and makes mom and dad wear rags, all so that Grandma can have more cash. Paint the picture with kids who are black and hispanic while Grandma is white, and the old homestead could get a little tense.</p>
        <p>Few Americans would endorse this set of priorities if they were presented this way, but the A.T.M. state has bred a brand of citizen delusion that makes dealing with these challenges harder. People tell pollsters they trust government less than ever, while acting as if the social programs they cherish -- government's proudest achievement -- simply fell from the sky. ''Tell the government to keep its hands off my Medicare'' is the way one confused woman put it on TV.</p>
        <p>If we are to escape these fiscal and psychic straitjackets, the coming decade is pivotal. Yet with budget surpluses having temporarily replaced big deficits, there's a complacency in the air about long-term woes. Liberals prefer to pray: the dire forecasts won't be borne out, they tell themselves, and if they are, we'll raise taxes (and deficits) high enough to finance the welfare state we need. Conservatives gloat: the A.T.M. is set to grind down activist government in ways that a thousand Ronald Reagan speeches never could.</p>
        <p>For voters not happy with either of these postures, the trade-offs loom large -- what will we give up in the way of entitlements to afford a government that can actually do something new and innovative? Some officials, like the Democratic senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and the Republican budget guru Kasich of Ohio, believe it will necessitate a synthesis of liberal and conservative ideologies -- a kind of ''New New Deal'' that pairs restraint on outlays for the elderly with a redesigned safety net. The aim over time, both suggest, would be to help citizens build more private wealth and rely less on Social Security, while using government to wring out (and redeploy) every excess health-care dollar it can find. The A.T.M. juggernaut would thus be slowed.</p>
        <p>For now, however, the federal government is stuck in a holding pattern. If Eliot Ness symbolized the fed in the 1930's and Neil Armstrong in the 1960's, the figures that embody the millennial American state are anonymous. They are the countless clerks in bland offices who this year will process 887 million Medicare claims and 542 million Social Security payments. Right this minute one of them is sitting at a computer tapping away at the keys, and if you close your eyes and use a little imagination, you can hear her clickety-clack blend with the echo from thousands of other federal claims processors across the land, until the mad rhythm of finger against keyboard surges in a crescendo worthy of George Orwell, or at least Rod Serling. This is the sound of your government at the dawn of the 21st century, and there's little that you -- or Al Gore and George W. Bush, for that matter -- are going to do about it.</p>
