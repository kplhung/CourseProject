        <p>DORIS LESSING</p>
        <p>A Biography.</p>
        <p>By Carole Klein.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 283 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>The last time I saw Doris Lessing was at one of those prize-awarding lunches in which the London book world delights. She was not one of the short-listed candidates; she had been asked along to add a little luster to the occasion. She sat at a large table of well-dressed, overconfident book persons, by which I mean marketing men, publicists, a smattering of editors. Watching her smile at them, looking as homely as fresh-baked bread, with her rounded face and housewife's gray bun, I remembered how, in the first volume of her autobiography, she described ''the Hostess.'' The Hostess was, she said, a convenient persona, useful for hiding behind. The Hostess was doing nicely until the end of the lunch when a woman friend came up to say hello to me. She looked excited.</p>
        <p>''I worship her,'' she said, eyes flickering meaningfully sideways. ''Wait a moment; I'm going to tell her so.''</p>
        <p>And, while I watched, this 50-something lady, a woman who sits on commissions and chairs important events, stalked over to Lessing, bent down and murmured: ''I just want to touch you. May I touch you?'' And Lessing, after a fractional pause, submitted to the act of homage. Her frozen look was what caught my attention. Leaving the building a few minutes later, I saw her quite solid form moving slowly away up the street, head bent. Entering a bright crowd of tourists, she simply disappeared.</p>
        <p>That scene during and after the lunch showed me why, in the first volume of her autobiography, Lessing had addressed the subject of the author's rights with such steely ferocity. ''You will never get access here,'' she wrote to her invisible biographers. ''You can't, this is the ultimate and inviolable privacy.''</p>
        <p>It was the prospect of the gathering of what James Joyce called ''biografiends'' that drove Lessing to start publishing her own version of the past in 1994. ''Under My Skin'' was, she disarmingly said, an allusion to one of her favorite Cole Porter songs; many readers found that it evoked something closer to a surgical incision. Hard though she can be in her judgment of other people, Lessing does not spare herself. Her willfulness and her intolerance of criticism are not disguised; if she writes harshly of her parents, of former lovers and, sometimes, of friends, she makes no attempt to pretty up her own portrait. ''I do not think that marriage is one of my talents'' may not sound like a gracious admission of failure, but it shows more honesty and self-awareness than Carole Klein, her first biographer, is willing to grant her.</p>
        <p>The autobiography remains incomplete. It ends in 1962, at the beginning of Lessing's deeply felt commitment to Sufism and her ambitious voyage into science fiction. This gives Klein the opportunity to explore some 40 years of work, including the terrifying novel ''The Fifth Child'' (1988), which she does discuss, and the troubling novel ''The Good Terrorist'' (1985), which she does not. Conversations with one of Lessing's most significant editors, Robert Gottlieb; with Clancy Sigal, on whom Lessing candidly drew for her portrait of Saul in ''The Golden Notebook'' (1962); and with a gathering of largely anonymous, frustrated interviewers enable Klein to claim to have uncovered the character Lessing sought to conceal.</p>
        <p>Readers will have deduced that I did not like this book. I do have some sympathy for Klein. Word from the Lessing camp, a fiercely loyal and discreet one, is that Klein was, from the earliest stages, given the cold shoulder and that Lessing's friends were urged not to speak to her. This may explain the biography's largely unsympathetic tone; but it does not excuse Klein for her readiness to accept, it would seem, almost any story that is given to her, so long as it reflects badly on the subject. A former friend of Lessing's complains that she cut him when he approached her in a restaurant. In goes his version; no attempt is made to discover why Lessing, who is a reasonably courteous woman, should have been so hostile.</p>
        <p>The relationship between Lessing and her parents is approached with singular crassness. Lessing herself has acknowledged a complete failure in her relationship with her mother; Klein translates an admission of defeat into a form of defiant celebration. Lessing's troubling account of physical games in which her disabled father would thrust his small daughter's head between his knees is quoted in order to show how little Lessing understood what she was writing about. Plainly, Klein tells us, Lessing does not know what she is doing when she describes her father's wooden leg as ''a big hard slippery hidden thing.'' It is, I would suggest, the biographer, not the novelist, who has missed the point here.</p>
        <p>Although I do not wish to turn this review into a litany of complaints, it seems shameful that a writer who produces such shoddy prose as Klein (''But Lessing, she is cautious. . . .''; ''He could be totally honest with her without worrying that he will upset her''; ''the pages continued to erupt from her typewriter'') can reproach Lessing for careless writing. But imperfect prose matters less than the sense conveyed on almost every page of moral disapproval and skepticism.</p>
        <p>Nobody would wish Lessing to be given a hagiography. Her enthusiasms, from science fiction and Sufism to cats, can sound bizarre. Her behavior toward the children she abandoned when she left Rhodesia for England in 1949 is hard to condone. It is, as Klein says, curious that the artist who accompanied her on a return trip to Africa found most of his work excluded from the book on which they were to collaborate, and he himself excised from her memoirs. Lessing is evidently capable of being unfair, harsh and unapologetic. Still, motives and explanations can be looked for with more rigor than Klein displays. Lessing's own extraordinary little book about the felines in her life, ''Particularly Cats and More Cats'' (1989), can, if carefully read, tell the reader more about her mind than her autobiographical volumes. Turning her gaze from herself, Lessing becomes astonishingly free and revealing.</p>
        <p>Pronouncing on the death of verbal culture, Lessing has tartly lamented the day that the family television arrived, to sit forevermore ''like a toad in the corner of the kitchen.'' She can comfort herself with the thought that Klein's biography is, while equally unwelcome, likely to be a less enduring visitor.</p>
