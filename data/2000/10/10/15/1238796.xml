        <p>CRUISE  Ship-to-Shore Photos</p>
        <p>Imagine a cruise with not a single roll of film on board. Zing.com is taking a step toward that with its Digital Photography Workshop-at-Sea, a seven-day cruise on Carnival's Victory leaving Miami Dec. 3. Lectures, demonstrations and use of new cameras will be included, with stops at San Juan, St. Croix and St. Thomas. And with daily satellite downloads of student work to their personal Web albums, folks at home can keep track of the cruise. The cost is $1,695 a person, based on double occupancy; companions not attending the workshops will pay $950. Call Four Corners Travel Agency at (305) 865-0850.</p>

        <p>HOTEL  Razors for Guests</p>
        <p>Sometimes the best way to beat Manhattan's traffic is to go downscale -- to two wheels. That's the idea at Le Parker Meridien, 118 West 57th Street; the hotel is offering guests free use of Razor scooters, the six-pound version of the old favorite. No pothole maps provided; (212) 245-5000.</p>
