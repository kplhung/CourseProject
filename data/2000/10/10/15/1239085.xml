        <p>After a campaign in the summer to promote free and low-cost health insurance for children and teenagers, the Westchester Health Department received 343 applications for coverage of 528 children and 13 pregnant women. As of the end of last month, 186 children were signed up for coverage, including 59 percent through Medicaid and 41 percent through Child Health Plus. As many as one in seven children in the United States do not have health insurance, which translates into about 23,000 uninsured children in Westchester, according to the county executive's office. The county also has a 24-hour line at (914) 637-2454 to provide families with information about how to sign up their children for comprehensive health coverage.</p>
