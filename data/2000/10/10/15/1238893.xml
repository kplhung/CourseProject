        <p>CHANGES in New York laws governing rent regulation in the last decade have strengthened the hand of owners seeking to convert buildings to co-ops or condominiums, real estate lawyers say.</p>
        <p>Under the ''luxury decontrol'' provisions that were enacted by the state legislature in 1993, rents are decontrolled on vacant apartments that rent for $2,000 a month or more. Occupied apartments that rent for $2,000 a month or more can be decontrolled if the household income of their residents exceeds $175,000 a year for two consecutive years.</p>
        <p>One result of luxury decontrol, according to David Ng, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, is a potential reduction in the bargaining power that tenants' groups have when a landlord decides to convert a rental building to a co-op or a condominium.</p>
        <p>He explained that under the co-op and condominium conversion law a landlord needs 15 percent of the tenants in the building to agree to buy their units in order for the most common type of conversion -- a noneviction-plan conversion -- to be effective. The law also permits the landlord to ''warehouse'' -- or hold vacant -- up to 10 percent of the total number of apartments in the building. This means that if 10 percent of the apartments are vacant, the landlord has to persuade owners of at least another 5 percent of the units in the building to buy -- a requirement that gives a well-organized tenants' group significant bargaining power.</p>
        <p>If, however, the landlord has been able to decontrol 5 percent of the units in the building, it makes it much easier for him to attain the sale of a total of 15 percent of the units necessary for the conversion.</p>
        <p>''By decontrolling those apartments,'' Mr. Ng said, ''the sponsor has substantially diminished the ability of the remaining tenants to negotiate effectively because it's a lot easier to convince unregulated tenants to buy their apartments or to evict them at the end of their lease if they don't.''</p>
        <p>Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that in buildings that have already been converted, luxury decontrol can have a different effect. Mr. Weinstein said that if a sponsor in an existing co-op or condominium had unsold units in the building -- and sponsors of many buildings do -- luxury decontrol can make it easier to sell the unsold units or even make it worthwhile for the sponsor to hold onto those apartments rather than sell them at all.</p>
        <p>''Once an apartment is decontrolled, a sponsor may be able to increase the rent to as much as market value,'' Mr. Weinstein said, and if that happens, the higher rent  may act as an inducement for the current occupant to buy the apartment. In fact, Mr. Weinstein said, he has represented at least one tenant who ended up purchasing an apartment -- basically, on the sponsor's terms -- primarily because the tenant knew his apartment would soon become subject to luxury deregulation.</p>
        <p>And in situations where an occupant of a deregulated apartment declines to buy but remains in possession, Mr. Weinstein said, it may be easier for the sponsor to sell the apartment to an investor -- something that would not be likely to occur when a tenant is paying a low regulated rent.</p>
        <p>''Investors buy occupied apartments on the basis of cash flow,'' which is basically the difference between the rent being paid by the tenant and the maintenance charges being paid to the co-op, Mr. Weinstein said.  ''If there is a negative cash flow, apartments are hard to sell. If the cash flow is positive, sales become easier.''</p>
        <p>In any case, he said, having a large number of apartments owned by the sponsor or investors generally works to the detriment of the co-op or condominium because lenders are hesitant to lend in such buildings.</p>
        <p>Yet another impact that luxury decontrol may have on co-ops and condominiums is the potential for increases in the real estate taxes paid by unit owners.</p>
        <p>Charles C. Dorego, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that under current law, assessments of co-op and condominium apartments are calculated under the same formula used to determine assessments of rental buildings. That formula, Mr. Dorego said, is based on the net income produced by the building.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, he said, the more net income the building produces, the higher its assessment. But since most units in co-ops and condominiums do not generate rental income, he said, the assessor is permitted to use the rents of nonowner-occupied apartments -- or even rents in similar apartments in rental buildings -- to impute a total net rental income for assessment purposes.</p>
        <p>And while using such an approach for assessments of co-ops and condominiums produces a somewhat skewed result, which exposes apartments in such buildings to higher taxes than similarly valued single family homes, the difference is compensated for by two things: the annual co-op and condominium tax abatement -- which was created to equalize the taxes paid by apartment owners with taxes paid by homeowners -- and the fact that the income used to determine the assessment was essentially ''capped'' by the rent stabilization laws.</p>
        <p>''What that means is that co-ops and condominiums have generally been assessed using rent-stabilized rents,'' Mr. Dorego said. But now, he said, with deregulation, there are sufficient numbers of apartments with market-rate rents in rental buildings and in co-ops and condominiums for the net income of those buildings to increase significantly.</p>
        <p>''The assessor is now free to use market rents when assessing a building,'' Mr. Dorego said. ''And that means you can end up with a building being assessed for three or four times what it is assessed now.''</p>
        <p>And higher assessments, he said, mean higher taxes for unit owners.</p>
        <p>Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, a tenant advocacy group in Manhattan, said that in addition to the obvious impact luxury decontrol has on tenants who lose their regulated status, it can also have an impact on tenants who simply wish to move to a new apartment.</p>
        <p>''In many parts of the city -- particularly Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn -- there is no such thing as a rent-regulated apartment coming back on the market after a vacancy,'' Mr. McKee said. He was referring to the ability of landlords to deregulate apartments that become vacant by making sufficient improvements to the apartment to get the rent above $2,000. Under current law, he explained, a landlord is entitled to permanently increase the rent on an apartment by one-fortieth of the cost of the improvement.</p>
