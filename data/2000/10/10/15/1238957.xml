        <p>PRIVACY is one of the main reasons people build stone walls or erect fences.</p>
        <p>The easy thing about this type of screening is that it doesn't have to be watered, pruned or cared for. The screen just stays put.</p>
        <p>But there is another way to provide some privacy -- with plants. But when you choose live screening, you must take the responsibility that goes with it.</p>
        <p>Pruning is the biggest chore required by most screening plants. At the top of this list for care is good old-fashioned privet. This ubiquitous plant thrives almost anywhere. It is inexpensive and grows well. In fact, this hedge is often found overgrown on well-established home sites.</p>
        <p>Though privet hedges are handsome, two negatives come to mind immediately. The plants lose their leaves in early fall. And privet must be pruned at least once, usually twice during the year.</p>
        <p>But there are other choices. The decision of what to plant usually comes down to what the local nursery has to offer and what the budget can manage. Most important is to choose a hedge plant that is appealing because it is going to be around for a long time.</p>
        <p>The first decision should be whether to plant an evergreen hedge or a deciduous one. There are several important points to remember if an evergreen is chosen. The exposure to sun and the plant have to match. Most of the evergreen hedge plants will thrive in modest shade. Also, it is important to know how wet or dry the location will be. No plants will thrive either in a damp, poorly drained location or in one that is always dry. Also competition from tree roots is an important factor to consider.</p>
        <p>Here are some thoughts on what might work well for a hedge. Possibly the star for an evergreen hedge is yew. This is an elegantly foliaged evergreen that can perform quite well as a hedge. One yew in particular that has become extremely popular is the dense-growing Hatfield yew. It never seems to grow out of bounds and many times gardeners can get away with pruning it maybe every few years.</p>
        <p>One warning with any yew, however: bypass it if there is a local deer problem. Deer find yew foliage too much to their liking.</p>
        <p>An alternate choice might be hemlock. Granted the troubles with the woolly adelgid and fiorina scale have caused many gardeners to look elsewhere for good evergreen hedge plants, but many nurseries are ready to plant selected forms because they do a fine screening job. With dormant oil sprays in early spring and a follow-up with insecticidal soap in early summer (both are harmless spray materials to the environment), these two pests can be kept under control.</p>
        <p>In addition, many of the upright hollies can form fine hedges. But be cautious here: some hollies, such as the Meserve hybrids, are too big for hedge material.</p>
        <p>More sedate in form are the boxwoods. However, their marginal hardiness can be a problem. Those who have visited gardens in the Deep South have admired the many handsome boxwood hedges. But in the Northeast, the survival of boxwoods in tough winters has always been questioned. And if their survival is not an issue, there is the problem of the ugly leaf browning.</p>
        <p>However, one particular boxwood named Tide Hill has proved itself over and over again that it is a survivor in colder climates. Its leaves are quite small and the growth is dense. This is a small hedge, too, and full-grown plants are about two-and-a-half-feet tall. And what is more, it stays dark green, even in winter.</p>
        <p>Sometimes gardeners like to set out rows of rhododendrons as screen plants because they, too, retain their foliage through the winter months. But here again, most of the rhododendrons are big plants and their choices must be made carefully, lest the plants eventually outgrow their spaces.</p>
        <p>Then there are so many choices that can be made if flowering hedge material is needed. These, of course, fall in the category of deciduous plants and they will lose their leaves soon after the first frosts. Some of the more elegant flowering hedge plants include quince, many of the shrub roses, forsythia and buddleia.</p>
        <p>If thorny hedge material is desired, mainly as a deterrent to keep out unwanteds, then the barberries are a good choice. One of the best hedge barberries is the variety called Crimson Pygmy. This one is a compact plant with unusual foliage color. Caution on its location, however. Provide full sun to retain its foliage color.</p>
        <p>One of the most handsome hedges I've ever seen (on a local estate) was a hedge planted with two forms of barberry. Alternating plants were the Crimson Pygmy and a gold-leaved barberry called Bonanaza Gold. It was a smashing boundary to a huge lawn-bowling area.</p>
        <p>Whatever hedge plants are chosen, they should provide years of pleasure for the property as well as the neighborhood.</p>
