        <p>DROP Randy Newman's name to many people and you may draw a blank expression. Mention the soundtracks to such films as ''Ragtime,'' ''The Natural,'' ''Avalon'' or ''Toy Story'' and the expression quickly creases in recognition. 'Oh,'' they say. ''He wrote those songs?''</p>
        <p>For more than 30 years Randy Newman has had an eclectic career as a singer-songwriter, film-score composer and, most recently, musical theater creator. He has released 17 albums and scored over 20 films, accumulating 13 Academy Award nominations along the way.</p>

        <p>DROP Randy Newman's name to many people and you may draw a blank expression. Mention the soundtracks to such films as ''Ragtime,'' ''The Natural,'' ''Avalon'' or ''Toy Story'' and the expression quickly creases in recognition. 'Oh,'' they say. ''He wrote those songs?''</p>
        <p>For more than 30 years Randy Newman has had an eclectic career as a singer-songwriter, film-score composer and, most recently, musical theater creator. He has released 17 albums and scored over 20 films, accumulating 13 Academy Award nominations along the way.</p>
        <p>Yet for all of his success, he is relatively unknown and greatly misunderstood, as his 1977 single ''Short People'' proved when most people missed Mr. Newman's deadpan irony. His earlier albums, specifically ''Sail Away'' (1972) and ''Good Old Boys'' (1974) overflow with characters long on ignorance, racism and other shortcomings. ''Faust,'' his contemporary stage musical adaptation of ''Dr. Faust,'' has more bite than any musical in memory. Perhaps Mr. Newman's songs are too smart for their own good or Americans have lost their sense of humor.</p>
        <p>''I thought, and still do, that people will get it,'' said Mr. Newman, who performs a 7 p.m. concert today at Stamford's Palace Theatre. ''America's sense of irony isn't that bad. Look at TV shows like 'Frasier,' which is enormously successful.''</p>
        <p>Like the music of John Prine, Mr. Newman's songs have sold better when recorded by other singers. This might suggest that people, short or otherwise, don't take to Mr. Newman's raw voice. Maybe so, Mr. Newman said, but he's not willing to turn off his microphone.</p>
        <p>''I'm always leery when other people sing my songs,'' he said from his home in Southern California. ''I like the way I sing my songs. I think they lose something when someone else sings them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman started out writing songs for other performers. Born into a musical family (his uncles Alfred and Lionel were both noted film composers), Mr. Newman had become a professional songwriter by the time he was 17, working for a Californian publishing house. He dropped out of U.C.L.A. to work at Reprise Records. Three Dog Night took his ''Mama Told Me Not To Come'' to No. 1 in 1970, the same year Harry Nilsson recorded an entire album of Mr. Newman's songs titled ''Nilsson Sings Newman.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Newman's first three albums failed to show up on the radar screen, ''Sail Away'' was a critical success and a moderate commercial hit. His subsequent albums ''Good Old Boys'' and ''Little Criminals'' (1977) also received some radio play, though they hardly made Mr. Newman a household name.</p>
        <p>In 1981, Milos Forman hired Mr. Newman to score his film ''Ragtime,'' and his work was nominated for two Academy Awards. He has worked both for himself and in films ever since. Last year he release his latest album, ''Bad Love'' and his most recent film score for ''Meet the Parents'' is just coming out in theaters.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Newman has complained at length about writing for film, he said the work was manageable. ''Actually, I've worked with some pretty good directors,'' he said. ''Barry Levinson was very good. I like my work in Avalon, when you can hear it.''</p>
        <p>As the composer, Mr. Newman naturally thinks that all of his scores are unduly muted. That's one reason why he comes out with his own albums every so often. ''Ill probably have another album out in the next year or so,'' he said. ''I always believe, irrespective of the evidence, that my albums will sell well.''</p>
        <p>Randy Newman performs a 7 p.m. concert today at the Palace Theatre, 61 Atlantic Avenue in Stamford. Tickets are $45. Call (203) 325-4466 for information.</p>
