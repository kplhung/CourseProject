        <p>Major airlines have raised full coach fares for the fifth time this year by imposing fuel surcharges of $20 to $60 on round-trip tickets. Heavily discounted leisure fares are not affected by the latest fuel surcharge, initiated by Delta on the Sept. 30 weekend and quickly followed by all the other major carriers except Southwest. The surcharge is $10 each way for up to 500 miles, $20 for 500 to 999 miles and $30 for longer trips.</p>

        <p>Major airlines have raised full coach fares for the fifth time this year by imposing fuel surcharges of $20 to $60 on round-trip tickets.

The surcharge is $10 each way for up to 500 miles, $20 for 500 to 999 miles and $30 for longer trips.</p>
        <p>Airlines can raise fares because of strong demand, said Ray Niedl, an ING Barings airline analyst. They sold over 77 percent of available seats in the first eight months of the year. With the surcharge, most big carriers' full coach fare between New York and West Coast cities like San Francisco is $2,434, up from $1,880 a year ago.</p>
