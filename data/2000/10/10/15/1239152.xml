        <p>At least two men, apparently armed with explosives, hijacked a Saudi Arabian passenger jet enroute to London today and forced it to land in Baghdad, where after three hours Iraqi officials announced that they had succeeded in negotiating the freedom of all those on board.</p>
        <p>The 90 passengers and 15 crew members, including one American traveler and 40 British citizens, were in good health and were taken by bus from the airport to Baghdad hotels, according to Iraqi officials.</p>
        <p>The Saudi Arabian Airlines' manager at Heathrow airport in London, Philip Griffin, was quoted as telling Agence France-Presse that the passengers would be flown out of Baghdad and arrive in Britain on Sunday evening. A state television announcer in Baghdad said they would be extended ''Arab hospitality.'' Neither Saudi Arabia nor Britain maintain diplomatic relations with Iraq.</p>
        <p>The hijackers, who reportedly threatened to blow up the plane on the tarmac, were taken into custody. ''The hijackers were arrested and there will be investigations,'' said Tahir Jaleel al-Habous, an official of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior.</p>
        <p>The demands made by the hijackers, said to be Saudi nationals, were not made public by the Baghdad authorities. Initially, officials in Baghdad said four men had commandeered the plane, but after securing the release of the passengers they revised the number to two.</p>
        <p>At various points during the standoff at Saddam International Airport, Iraqi officials said the men were upset over what they called unreported human rights violations in Saudi Arabia, that they chose Iraq as their destination because it rejects ''American hegemony'' in the region, and that they wanted ''political asylum'' in Iraq.</p>
        <p>After the standoff, an Iraqi Ministry of Interior official said the men had also warned that if they did not get what they wanted, another plane would be hijacked in coming days.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 115 originated in the Saudi port city of Jidda.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether the hijacking was related to the recent weeks of deadly conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. The violence, which has claimed almost 100 lives, most of them Palestinian, has spurred rage and huge demonstrations against Israel and the United States in most Arab states.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil-producer, is a close ally of the United States and the presence of American troops in the kingdom has been denounced by religious conservatives and by the accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has made the expulsion of American troops his main demand.</p>
        <p>However, the Saudi government  has also strongly condemned Israeli actions against Palestinians in the last three weeks, with Saudi leaders urging all Muslims to donate money and other aid to the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Iraq has been more forceful, calling even today for attacks on Americans and American interests around the world and proclaiming that Iraqis were prepared to go on suicide terror missions against Israel.</p>
        <p>The Saddam International Airport in Baghdad reopened only two months ago after being shuttered for 10 years by the United Nations embargo on Iraq. Since Aug. 18, more than 20 planes from Egypt, Syria and Turkey have landed, reportedly carrying permitted shipments of food and medicine.</p>
        <p>Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, however, are frigid. The gulf kingdom was the base for the allied assault on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of neighboring Kuwait and it has remained a bastion of opposition to ending Iraqi isolation.</p>
        <p>Iraqi hostility also has not abated.</p>
        <p>Soon after the hijacked plane landed in Baghdad, an official of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior said on state television that the hijackershad demanded direct negotiations with Saudi authorities. The Iraqi official said the demand was refused because the delay in getting a Saudi to Baghdad would cause unnecessary stress for the plane's passengers.</p>
        <p>Civil aviation officials in Cairo first reported the hijacking at about 2:55 p.m. (8:55 a.m. Eastern time), when the plane was in Egyptian airspace 70 miles southeast of Cyprus.</p>
        <p>In a radio transmission from the Saudi airliner monitored by officials in Israel and then broadcast over radio and television in the region, the pilot is heard asking the control tower at Larnaca, Cyprus, to notify Syrian airport officials that the plane was on its way. ''The hijacker is saying that he has TNT on board and he might blow the aircraft, and we have passengers from all kinds of nationalities,'' the pilot said in an even voice. ''Do you read?''</p>
        <p>A short time later, according to another transmission monitored on the ground, the pilot was heard telling air traffic controllers that he needed permission to fly over Syrian air space, but that the hijacker was demanding to go to Baghdad.</p>
