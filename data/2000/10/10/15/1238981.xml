        <p>Once a cause for celebration on Staten Island, the National Lighthouse Center and Museum may now be a cause for concern.</p>
        <p>Since 1998, when a national steering committee selected a 10-acre former Coast Guard base next to the Staten Island Ferry terminal as the  project site, the museum's board has had trouble raising money. As a result, the museum's opening has been postponed from 2001 to 2003.</p>
        <p>The museum's board has raised $500,000 for operating expenses and to hire a design firm. But it has only  about $100,000 toward the $5 million needed to meet the new opening date.</p>
        <p>The site was chosen two years ago because of the ''visitor potential'' of the 1.5 million tourists who arrive at the nearby terminal each year and because of $5 million the city and state pledged to the project.</p>
        <p>The city's Economic Development Corporation has been spending that money to shore up, replace two roofs and remove asbestos from several of the site's seven brick and limestone buildings. But the board is still far from the matching $5 million.</p>
        <p>''They have until July 2002 to raise the money,'' said Janel Patterson of the Economic Development Corporation, ''and we're confident that they'll reach their goal.'' Ms. Patterson did not say what might happen if the goal were not reached.</p>
        <p>Henry Stephenson, the museum's executive director, said the corporation met with the board last spring and told it to pick up the fund-raising pace. Since then, the museum has dismissed a fund-raiser and a director of development and replaced them with new people.</p>
        <p>Lack of money has also hampered the museum's plans to add attractions. For example, the owners of a lightship -- a vessel that carries an electric beacon as a kind of portable lighthouse -- have wanted to sell it to the museum for some time. Mr. Stephenson said he had hoped to open the lightship to the public at the site's pier during Operation Sail on this July 4. But the museum has raised only $35,000 of the $100,000 needed to acquire the ship.</p>
        <p>Liz Aubert, a spokeswoman for Seaeye, the Massachusetts company that owns the ship, said that if there was not ''significant progress'' toward meeting that goal by next July, the company might offer the ship to another organization.</p>
        <p>But there may be financial hope. Mr. Stephenson, who recently announced he would soon step down as director, said he had learned ''our property seems to qualify for federal historic preservation tax credits.'' He said those credits might be parlayed into several million dollars, through a process that entailed setting up a partnership with private investors. ''I'm very optimistic,'' he said. ''Maybe I don't have good reason to be.''</p>
