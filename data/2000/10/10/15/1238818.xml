        <p>THE word clock -- indeed the whole notion of time passing -- crops up in the lyrics of several songs on ''The Friends of Rachel Worth,'' the new album by the Australian rock band the Go-Betweens. Somehow, that's not surprising. After all, it is the group's first release in 12 years.</p>
        <p>While the six albums they released in the 1980's resulted in barely a commercial ripple, the Go-Betweens were often hailed as one of the more interesting modern rock groups most people never heard of. Built around the complementary sensibilities of its co-leaders, the singer-songwriters Robert Forster and Grant McLennan, the band's music -- much in the spirit of influences like Lou Reed and Patti Smith -- cleverly connected the cerebral with the sonic.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as polished as the band's wordplay and arrangements were, the group was undone by a succession of missteps (several label changes) and misadventures (an unproductive move to England). It broke up almost unnoticed in 1990, but not before leaving behind a catalog that has influenced numerous post-grunge pop-rock groups.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Forster and Mr. McLennan continued to record separately (the latter's 1995 album, ''Horsebreaker Star,'' is one of the unrecognized gems of the last decade), recent reissues of the Go-Betweens' albums brought welcome new attention to their old work.</p>
        <p>That it has held up surprisingly well was also made clear by the warm reception the two guitarists received during a 1999 reunion tour. Buoyed by the response and with the nimble support of the bassist Adele Pickvance, the keyboardist Sam Coomes and the drummer Janet Weiss, as well as guitar and vocal contributions from Ms. Weiss's band mates in Sleater-Kinney, Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker, they have collaborated on ''The Friends of Rachel Worth'' (Jetset TWA31CD), and the album is a gentle-toned but powerful affirmation of their still vibrant vision. (The group will perform at the Bowery Ballroom in Manhattan on Thursday.)</p>
        <p>Part of the appeal of the Go-Betweens' music is the contrasting writing styles of Mr. Forster and Mr. McLennan. Both possess a gift for melodies, but they use them as means to different ends. The pop-oriented Mr. McLennan slants his tightly constructed songs (the lilting ''Heart and Home'' and the pulsating ''The Clock'') toward choruses that get under your skin before you're even conscious of their appeal -- or their often bittersweet messages (''Ba-ba-ba/ There's ice around your heart -- my home/ Ba-ba-ba/ Ba-ba-ba''). Meanwhile, the more arty Mr. Forster lays out his loose-knit compositions as backdrops for his talk-sing style, rendering tunes like the wistful ''Surfing Magazines'' (''We used to wet our fingers on surfing magazines'') and the disarming ''When She Sang About Angels'' into psychological travelogues.</p>
        <p>And yet, it is the whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts quality that makes the Go-Betweens' music so enduringly distinctive. Ultimately, ''The Friends of Rachel Worth'' is more a continuation than a reunion. And, befitting two songwriters who have always seemed out of sync with their times, it sounds refreshingly timeless. As Mr. McLennan sings on the album's opening track, ''I don't want to change a thing when there's magic in here.'' Listening to this wonderful album, who could argue?</p>
