        <p>FOR the better part of the 20th century, this village's residents could not make their way to the water's edge without running the risk of a trespassing charge. The land along the river was industrialized, owned by companies exploiting the convenient transportation afforded by the river.</p>
        <p>Industry largely left by the mid-1970's, but by then the decades of production of everything from copper wire to munitions left the ground saturated with contaminants.</p>
        <p>In the 25 years since, cleanup and development plans have had a history of fizzling. What could be the crown jewel of Hastings remains, for all intents and purposes, hidden under a tarp.</p>
        <p>But now village officials say they are trying to change that.</p>
        <p>Mayor William Lee Kinnally Jr. recently assured residents that ''we will see something in our lifetimes,'' before adding to appreciative laughter, ''depending on how long we live.''</p>
        <p>The mayor, county and state officials and a group of citizens have developed what they say is a good working relationship with ARCO, which owns the largest chunk of the waterfront, the 28 acres formerly owned by Anaconda Wire &amp; Cable. (Exxon Mobil owns almost nine acres, and Uhlich Color Company, a pigment manufacturer still in operation, owns just over six more.)</p>
        <p>ARCO has been demolishing abandoned buildings and carting away the remains. It has also spent $7 million to rebuild the bulkheads that prevent the waterfront from eroding and has said it wants to help put all its land back into productive use.</p>
        <p>The Regional Planning Association, a nonprofit regional planning organization, was brought in to draw up a land-use plan, since many felt that the course of the cleanup should be determined by just how the land will be used. The latest version of the plan will be presented to the public next Saturday at Hillside Elementary School from 1 to 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>To let residents put their own stamp on the plan, a weekend-long open meeting was held last month at Hillside Elementary School.</p>
        <p>This process was not without its detractors. While Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic State Assemblyman and the chairman of the Committee on Environmental Conservation, said that he thought it was good news that ARCO was ''in the room,'' he added that it was bad news that ARCO's need to make a profit ''must take precedence'' over what he called public relations. Going ahead with planning under the assumption that ARCO will clean up the land adequately is fiction, he said.</p>
        <p>Sandra M. Stash, vice president of environmental management for ARCO, said, however, that it was in the interest of the company's shareholders ''to make all sites safe for human health and the environment and to provide benefit to the community.''  To kick-start the open meeting, Robert Lane , the director of regional design program at the Regional Planning Association, introduced the working outlines.</p>
        <p>Their essence was to divide the waterfront into three sections. The first, which would start right after the bridge near the train station, would be a continuation of the downtown area, complete with shops, restaurants and either a performing arts center or an inn. The second section would be dedicated to residences, and the third area would be parkland, with a branch of an educational institution at the farthest tip.</p>
        <p>After the presentation, two buses took dozens of residents to the waterfront.</p>
        <p>''Just incredible,'' said Amy Parekh, motioning at the vastness around her and the majestic backdrop of the Palisades, which seemed just a good rock-skip across the river. Ms. Parekh grew up in Hastings and recently graduated from Barnard College, where she wrote her senior thesis on the waterfront. But like most residents, this was her first time here.</p>
        <p>Back at Hillside, residents were divided into 12 focus groups. They huddled around elementary school lunch tables, and enthusiastically put pen to paper to transform industrial blight into their own private Paris, giving the proceedings the flavor of a Baron Haussmann fantasy camp.</p>
        <p>At the outset, anything resembling a consensus proved elusive.</p>
        <p>In one group, the issue of how much the waterfront should reflect the history of the land was discussed. Several weighed in on the side of historical links before another participantbrought up the fact that the waterfront was originally made from landfill, ''so pioneers hadn't exactly walked on it.''</p>
        <p>And in terms of the industrial past, was it something that should be remembered or removed? If we save any one thing, one person motioned, it has to be the water tower. But others thought the tower more eyesore than iconic. In another group, one person defined parkland as baseball fields, while another fretted about quietly contemplating nature and getting plunked in the head by a hardball.</p>
        <p>Eventually, compromises were made. The shells of one or two of the industrial buildings should be incorporated into the plan. There should be two baseball fields, and parks throughout.</p>
        <p>After the Saturday meeting ended, representatives of the Regional Planning Association took three hours to incorporate suggestions into a roughest-of-cuts new plan.</p>
        <p>The plan was presented to the re-assembled group on Sunday, and then Mr. Lane took a poll: ''Can people raise their hands if they feel we're on the right track?'' All but a handful went up, and immediately a man shouted out a well-received joke to send the plan out for a building permit ''tomorrow!''</p>
        <p>That won't happen, of course. After next Saturday's presentation, the final version of the plan will be presented in December.</p>
        <p>If all goes well, ARCO will use the final plan and a New York State Department of Environmental Conservation report as cleanup guides. Then the plan will be sent to developers, who will bid on the job, which will be financed by grants, bonds, sales of residences and taxes levied on the new homes and stores.</p>
