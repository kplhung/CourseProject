        <p>Congregants of Christ Church Riverdale are to gather today to rededicate their 134-year-old church after a decade-long restoration, whose completion was aided by a munificent, and surprise, intervention.</p>
        <p>Designed by Richard Upjohn, architect of the current Trinity Church on Wall Street, the landmarked Episcopal church at Henry Hudson Parkway and 252nd Street in the Riverdale section of the Bronx opened in 1866. It was part of a movement to bring the Gothic style to the United States.</p>
        <p>''When we were founded, there were gaslights, a simple wooden altar and wooden pews,'' said the Rev. William Davidson, the rector. What the 350-member congregation did not know was that under eight layers of paint, the ceiling and walls were inscribed with elaborate stenciling -- loops, bands, grape leaves, wagon wheels -- in rich reds, blues, yellows and greens. All of which was eventually revealed by the restoration artist, Cynthia Hinson.</p>
        <p>But first, under the supervision of the project architect, John Copelin of Hall Associates, the exterior was renovated: the slate roof replaced, the stonework, brownstone coping and window edges repointed. That part of the $750,000 project was completed five years ago, leaving the congregation $200,000 short of the $350,000 needed for the interior.</p>
        <p>''Last March, during Mass,'' Father Davidson said, ''I jokingly said, 'All we need is $200,000. If any of you are preparing your income tax and have an extra $200,000, just bring it in.' Everyone laughed. Lo and behold, the next week, in the mailbox, was a cashier's check. I said, 'Great, somebody gave us $200, anonymously.' ''</p>
        <p>Two days later, he said, a collection counter ''came up the stairs and said, 'What should I do with this check?' I said, 'Deposit it toward the restoration.' She said, 'But it's for $200,000.' And I said, 'Oh, boy!' '' Today, at the ceremony, thanks will go to  the restorers, the laborers and an anonymous donor. ''It's an ultimate act of charity to give and receive no recognition,'' Father Davidson said.</p>
