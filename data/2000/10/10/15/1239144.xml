        <p>In what NATO commanders and United Nations officials declared was their first blow against organized crime here, international police officers and British marines raided 13 homes, bars and brothels before dawn today, arresting 25 people.</p>
        <p>While the police declined to identify those arrested, they admitted that the raids were on properties owned by the Geci clan, a family of former Kosovo Liberation Army fighters who are said to have turned to crime.</p>
        <p>Trafficking in drugs and prostitutes and other forms of crime are said to have flourished in Kosovo since NATO ended its bombing campaign last year. The United Nations police force and an international judiciary have been understaffed and accused of working too slowly to control crime since Serbian security forces withdrew in June 1999 under an agreement with NATO.</p>
        <p>Although dozens of members of Kosovo's dwindling Serbian minority have been killed in the 15 months since NATO and the United Nations took control, one of the best known killings still unsolved by the police here was of Rexhep Luci, an ethnic Albanian who was director of city planning in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Another unsolved killing was of a journalist, Shefet Popova. Three of the arrests today were said by the police to be linked to those murders, but no details were given.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luci was regarded as an honest official who had taken a stand against dangerous illegal buildings. Pristina is in the middle of a construction boom because thousands of refugees and 450 charitable and military organizations have moved in.</p>
        <p>Last week security forces arrested Sabit Geci, a former Kosovo Liberation Army commander who is now said by international officials to run crime operations. He is being detained under the United Nations legal code on charges of threatening someone in a brothel he owns.</p>
        <p>Gordon McRae, operations director for the United Nations police force, said 30 police officers and 290 Royal Marines raided 13 addresses simultaneously at 6 a.m. today.</p>
        <p>Sections of Pristina were cordoned off throughout the day as bands of heavily armed marines clomped down streets, chasing leads to other addresses. The raiders found 15 guns and $50,000 in cash, the police said.</p>
