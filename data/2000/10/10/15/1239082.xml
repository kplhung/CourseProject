        <p>New York State Supreme Court in White Plains is about to rule on suit filed by Federated Conservationists of Westchester County alleging Mount Pleasant, NY, should not have cut down trees to build commuter parking lot adjacent to Valhalla train station (S)</p>

        <p>The fate of a 120-space commuter lot built by Mount Pleasant two years ago will be decided in State Supreme Court in White Plains this month. The Federated Conservationists of Westchester County, a 30-year-old environmental group, sued the town in 1998, claiming that the property is part of a county park and the town should not have cut down trees on the two acres of it used for the lot, which serves the Valhalla train station. The group wants the parking lot turned back to woods or, if that is not possible, it wants Mount Pleasant to give the county comparable land for its parks system. Mount Pleasant contends that the state owns the land and it received permission to use the property from the State Department of Transportation.</p>
