        <p>Women and human Development</p>
        <p>The Capabilities Approach.</p>
        <p>By Martha C. Nussbaum.</p>

        <p>Equality for women, like equality in general, is at its core a universalist ideal. The subordination of women in some form cuts across all known cultures and everywhere seems connected to a view of women as a natural resource, existing for the benefit of others, rather than as a subject of the human enterprise. It is hardly surprising, then, that feminism is an international phenomenon. Yet paradoxically, many contemporary feminists share the particularist outlook of the larger multicultural left, for whom ''universal'' values are merely the values of the dominant culture, and efforts by Western feminists to promote women's rights globally amount to imperialism. At the same time, liberals who do embrace equality as a universal value are often dismissive of central feminist concerns like oppression by familial, religious or cultural norms: they see the family and other communal associations as belonging to a private sphere of individual choice in which the political principles governing the public realm do not apply. The left and liberal perspectives converge in a cultural relativism that discourages outside interference with an array of traditional practices, from purdah to child marriage to genital mutilation, that constrict the lives of women in the third world.</p>
        <p>Martha C. Nussbaum has made a project of defending a feminist universalism against relativist claims. Indeed, she has argued that American feminists should pay more attention to the urgent problems of women elsewhere. Both cultural pluralism and individual autonomy, she contends, are themselves better served by universal norms of justice. In her last book, ''Sex and Social Justice,'' Nussbaum suggested that such norms could be based on what the economist Amartya Sen named the ''capabilities approach'': the idea that social policy should center on fostering human capacities for functioning in the world. ''Women and Human Development'' is devoted to elaborating this concept and discussing in painstaking detail its implications for women and feminism in developing countries.</p>
        <p>Nussbaum's method is to apply a liberal ethical philosophy rooted in Aristotle, Kant and Mill to specific situations encountered in the course of her visits to India to do research on women's development projects. Her humanism is ambitious, proposing a wide-ranging list of ''central human capabilities'' that deserve social protection, including life and health, bodily integrity (including opportunities for sexual satisfaction and reproductive choice), self-respecting relationships, political participation and equal employment and property rights. But her narrative always comes back to individual women in a society whose constitution guarantees their equal rights and whose religious, familial and economic arrangements restrict their capabilities at every turn: like Vasanti, who left her abusive husband and has struggled to make a living with the help of a loan from a women's self-help organization; or Jayamma, too old to do the only work open to her, carrying bricks, and dependent on her equally unskilled, impoverished daughters.</p>
        <p>The capabilities approach is really a theory of freedom as positive action (in contrast to negative liberty), though, oddly, Nussbaum rarely uses the word ''freedom.'' Besides insisting that the central capabilities are generically human rather than culturally specific, she firmly defends individualism, another much-maligned position: it is each person's capabilities that must be supported, not those of ''groups or families or states or other corporate bodies.'' Individuals within families may have divergent interests; a husband may interfere with his wife's exercise of her capabilities, or a parent with a child's. Nor can ''culture'' exert claims apart from those of its individual members. To speak of a unitary ''Indian culture'' in a nation with multiple languages, religions, castes, classes and urban and rural populations with differing regional customs is, Nussbaum observes, as silly as imagining an ''American culture'' with a single set of norms. And to dismiss feminism as a Western import is to ignore indigenous strains of protest as well as denying Indian women the right to appropriate any ideas, whatever their source, that speak to their condition.</p>
        <p>What then of the woman who prefers a traditional way of life? Nussbaum rejects ''two unsatisfactory extremes'' -- the ideas that women's preferences must always be taken at face value and that preference for an unjust status quo should never be honored. The capabilities approach, she argues, demands that a woman have a real opportunity to surmount low expectations and cultural pressures that may shape her desires; but it also supports her right to refuse.</p>
        <p>A similar effort at balance informs Nussbaum's discussion of religion: while she wants to restrain religious authorities from interfering with women's capabilities, she also sees the quest for transcendence as an important capability in its own right. Accordingly she defends not only the free exercise of religion but more dubiously the Indian system of state-sanctioned religious courts, on the ground that in the Indian context it is needed to safeguard the existence of minority religions like Islam. Here, as elsewhere in the book, Nussbaum acknowledges the tension between feminist principles and traditional practices, yet sees forced ''liberation'' as profoundly disrespectful of the complexity of people's inner lives: she tells the poignant story of a traditional Muslim woman who suffers intense pain when tricked by a ''modern'' colleague of her husband's into showing her face in public.</p>
        <p>''Women and Human Development'' is an important book. It presents a rich, nuanced argument that is both intellectually rigorous and attuned to practical dilemmas. But it also has a significant limitation -- its liberal, state-oriented conception of politics. The question that animates Nussbaum is how governments might move from bestowing empty legal rights to making a real difference in women's lives. She sees that the family and organized religion enlist the power of the state to constrain women, but does not recognize that they are themselves primary institutions of social control, reproducing patriarchal culture through the socialization of children. Nor does her analysis take account of the unconscious fear and guilt behind women's decisions to submit to authority. Enlightened state policies, alone, will not change these deeply rooted patterns. As a brief for the legitimacy and necessity of global feminism, ''Women and Human Development'' is eloquent. The undertow of resistance to all such briefs -- and the question of what to do about it -- remains between the lines.</p>
