        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Perhaps stranger than Hitler's conquest of France in 1940 are Ernest R. May's book about it, ''Strange Victory,'' and David Stafford's review (Sept. 17). May simply echoes what so many have claimed in the past, and Stafford lets it ride.</p>
        <p>William L. Shirer's ''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' tells the needed truth of World War II and the charade it was. The capitulation of France, along with the rest of Europe that fell to the Nazi juggernaut, was only part of a grand scheme and purpose -- the destruction of the Soviet Union and its socialist experiment. Indeed, the period of time between the German invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, and the invasions of Denmark, Norway and France in the spring of 1940 became known as the ''phony war,'' or Sitzkrieg.</p>
        <p>Hitler took no country by sheer force. That was myth. May and Stafford write that the military strength of France and the Allies was greater than that of Germany. Each and every conquered nation had already been betrayed. Norway had its Quisling, Poland its Pilsudski and France its Pierre Laval. The other countries had counterparts who handed over their seats of power as the German armies marched in unopposed. Only three nations in the world exposed and destroyed the Nazis in time -- Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States. There was no mystery why Hitler did not proceed with an invasion of England in the wake of Dunkirk. Britain was not about to roll over.</p>
        <p>As Senator Harry Truman said in 1941 after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, ''If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany.'' That same psychology held true as each of the nations of Europe fell to Germany. Hitler was allowed to do what he did only because of his promise and plan eventually to invade the Soviet Union. France was but one price to pay, along with the rest of Europe and those six million Jews, to accomplish that end.</p>
