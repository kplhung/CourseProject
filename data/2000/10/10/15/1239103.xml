        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Oct. 8 article on economic development in Jersey City (''Is Jersey City Too Alluring?'') shed more heat than light on the process by which the city decides whether to provide tax incentives to encourage redevelopment.</p>
        <p>For example, while the article mentions that the city has toughened its negotiation stance with real estate developers in order to take advantage of favorable conditions in the current real estate market, it failed to explain how that was done. In the early 1990's, office buildings in Jersey City paid an average of $2 per square foot under a tax abatement. The office buildings under construction today pay $3 per square foot under an abatement.</p>
        <p>Further, in addition to shortening the term of abatements in Jersey City from 30 years to 20 years, the Schundler administration has also accelerated the rate by which an abated project reaches conventional taxation.</p>
        <p>Finally, the Schundler administration was the first in Jersey City's history to require all development applications to be the subject of a rigorous cost-benefit analysis to ensure that any new commercial development would be paying more in taxes than it would likely demand in services. This helps ensure that new development is not subsidized by existing homeowners.</p>
        <p>The article also suggests that Jersey City no longer has to compete with Manhattan for corporate tenants because the Big Apple doesn't have any development sites left. This is news to Jersey City. Our understanding is that Reuters, Morgan Stanley, Conde Nast, PricewaterhouseCoopers and The New York Times are currently in the process of developing over five million square feet of new office space in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>It is also worth noting that Jersey City must compete with the entire region for corporate tenants, including Brooklyn, Long Island City, and Westchester in New York, and Newark, Florham Park and Parsippany in New Jersey.</p>
