      <block class="full_text">
        <p>WE NEED a Marshall Plan for our schools,'' Ronald O. Ross said as he bounded up a staircase, two steps at a time, at Lincoln Elementary School here.</p>
        <p>Since he arrived as superintendent of the Mount Vernon schools two years ago, Mr. Ross has tried to adopt such a plan in this chronically troubled district, impressing and infuriating school officials with his take-no-prisoners approach.</p>
        <p>Last spring he campaigned successfully for a $100 million bond issue to renovate the district's buildings. In August he hired a private security force to patrol the violence-plagued high school, circumventing the teachers' union. He is enforcing strict dress rules -- no ''do-rags,'' no chains worn outside the shirt, no hats -- and he frequently walks the halls himself, delivering impromptu lectures to students about the importance of a high school diploma in a silky preacher's voice.</p>
        <p>But now Mr. Ross is facing competition from parents who doubt that the schools can be reformed from within and want to start their own charter schools to lead the district toward change. Of six applications for charter schools in Westchester, three are from Mount Vernon. If they pass the state's review process, the schools will open in the fall of 2001.</p>
        <p>Although some school superintendents look favorably on charter schools, which are publicly financed but free of the control of local school districts, Mr. Ross and some of his allies in Mount Vernon have voiced strong opposition.</p>
        <p>''It's a way of robbing from the poor,'' Mr. Ross said. Because many of the parents who are behind the charter efforts now send their children to private school, they would leave the district with less money but an equal number of students. That would cause serious harm, because the district spends less per student and gets less state aid than most others in the county, Mr. Ross said.</p>
        <p>And he scoffed at the notion that competition with charter schools can spur a district to innovation and improvement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross goes further, saying that one of the charter applications -- for the proposed Renaissance Academy charter school -- is a thinly disguised effort by a group of wealthy and mostly white parents to create their own elite school within the mostly black district.</p>
        <p>''The bigotry of parents ought not be funded at taxpayer expense,'' he said. ''That's going to set the city back 50 years.''</p>
        <p>The Renaissance applicants counter that three of their nine board members are black. Several said Mr. Ross was recklessly exploiting the divisions that have long plagued this city of 67,000, where blacks constitute 54 percent of the population and 84  percent of the students at the city's one high school.</p>
        <p>The charter applicants resent Mr. Ross's suggestion that they should keep their children in failing, overcrowded and dangerous schools. And they say they are only asserting their right as taxpayers to a publicly financed education.</p>
        <p>''It's heart wrenching to me because I pay so much in taxes, and I'd rather have my daughter be in school in Mount Vernon,'' said Georgina Sussewell, a black member of the Renaissance board, whose 11-year-old daughter currently attends private school.</p>
        <p>The applicants say their schools will bring higher standards and more accountability than the district's public schools. Unlike public schools, charters in New York State must meet or exceed state standards on Regents-mandated tests and any additional academic goals they set for themselves, or they can be closed.</p>
        <p>Charter schools have been championed by liberals and conservatives alike as an innovative approach to school reform, and a number of polls have found that they are particularly popular among blacks. The majority of the children currently enrolled in New York State's 24 operating charter schools are black, said Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor of public administration at New York University, who has written extensively on school choice. ''Charter schools crop up in areas where you have a parent population that is not satisfied with the public schools,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But in Mount Vernon, the course of reform has been altered by a history of bitter, racially charged disputes over control of the school system.</p>
        <p>Long after blacks became the majority in the city in the 1970's, school board elections were dominated by the Italian Civic Association, which was founded in 1917 and elected its first school board member in 1919. Starting in the early 90's, blacks began asking why whites monopolized the school board -- and most teaching and administrative jobs -- even as they increasingly placed their own children in parochial and private schools.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1990's, the only school still popular with parents in the wealthier and whiter north side of the city was the Pennington-Grimes Elementary School, which is housed in an immaculate stone building in the affluent neighborhood known as Fleetwood. In 1996, the school board -- which still had a white majority -- voted to expand Pennington and two other elementary schools to include seventh and eighth grades.</p>
        <p>That proposal angered many in Mount Vernon's black community, who had long felt that the school board was favoring Pennington. ''For a long time, there was a community that wanted to make Pennington Grimes treated like a private school -- a mentality of making one school based on racial demographics a great school and ignoring the rest of the district,'' said the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson of Grace Baptist Church, a longtime activist on school issues.</p>
        <p>Although Pennington was only 55 percent white, that was a higher percentage than any other Mount Vernon school. Many blacks saw the effort to expand it as a naked power grab by whites who wanted their own middle school.</p>
        <p>The proposal became a watershed issue, helping Mr. Richardson and other members of a group called the Coalition for the Empowerment of People of African Ancestry to elect several new board members and gain a black majority on the school board for the first time.</p>
        <p>One of the first things the black-majority board did was to scrap the plan to expand Pennington. It also rescinded the contract of  William C. Pratella, who was the superintendent, and began looking for a replacement.</p>
        <p>It was six months later that the Renaissance Academy charter school proposal was conceived, according to the application, which which was submitted in August. It proposes a school of 125 seventh and eighth graders, expanding to the 12th grade by the fifth year, with a total enrollment of 425 students.</p>
        <p>''What we are trying to do is create a school with an academically rigorous environment,'' Eileen Justino, the lead applicant, said.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Ross and a number of black school officials and parents, the application was a repeat of the failed effort to expand Pennington, and they believe that some of its leaders had segregationist motives.</p>
        <p>''I think one has to be suspicious of the timing,'' said one black Mount Vernon parent. ''The energy around generating a charter school just galvanized after the board became majority African-American and we got an African-American superintendent.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Justino said the notion that race was a factor is absurd. (All but two of the school's nine board members refused to speak about the application, fearing more controversy.) The school's proposed board includes three blacks, up from one on the school's first application in 1999. The proposed location is on the city's heavily black and poor south side. And most importantly, the school's student body will be determined by lottery, and it will be open to all Mount Vernon children.</p>
        <p>Any charter school that tried to restrict its student body would not be approved, said Robert J.Bellafiore, the president of the Charter Schools Institute at the State University of New York. ''We'll be able to tell if they're not publicizing and marketing the school broadly throughout the school district.'' The university's trustees and the State Board of Regents are the two authorities that grant charters.</p>
        <p>Race aside, Mr. Richardson maintained that the Renaissance application remained an elitist proposal by wealthier members of the community who were interested only in their own children's welfare. It would hurt the public schools, he said, by removing the best students and most motivated parents.</p>
        <p>The applicants counter that their school will benefit the entire district by providing structure and accountability -- elements they said are lacking in the district's middle schools.</p>
        <p>The statistics are grim.</p>
        <p>In 1999, only 23 percent of the district's eighth graders met state standards in English, and only 13 percent met them in Math. The number of students exceeding state standards was 1 percent in both categories. Those results put Mount Vernon's two middle schools far below the state average in public school performance.</p>
        <p>''The Renaissance Academy Charter School will serve as a catalyst for much needed change in the city's other schools,'' their application states. ''We are confident that innovations such as a more demanding curriculum, highly encouraged parental involvement, a dress code, a longer school year and higher expectations will put us on the right track.''</p>
        <p>Although the application was rejected on its first try last year, it was one of 17 finalists out of the 90 filed in New York State, Mr. Bellafiore said. Only 11 schools were approved in 1999, the first season of applications since New York's charter school law was passed in December 1998.</p>
        <p>A letter of rejection sent to the Renaissance applicants listed two reasons for their failure: a lack of sufficient community support and a financial plan that ''left little room for error.'' Mr. Bellafiore, however,  said the application was an excellent one, and the rejection letter includes a note in his handwriting: ''Stay with it!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Justino said this year's application included more evidence of support from the community, including between 30 and 40 letters of support and about 140 signatures on petitions by residents who said they would either send their own children to a school like Renaissance or supported it for the community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said most black parents in Mount Vernon still oppose any sort of charter school and would like to see the schools reformed from within.</p>
        <p>But that may be changing. The other two charter school applications are both being led by black women, and all of their proposed board members are black.</p>
        <p>Referring to Mr. Ross's reform efforts, one parent involved in a charter application said: ''I really hope he succeeds. But I can't wait for him to succeed. I can tell you -- black, white, north side, south side -- anyone that has money moves or sends their children out. We would like our children to go to school here.''</p>
        <p>Parents of all races are understandably concerned about safety in the public schools. Metal detectors were installed at the high school in 1995 after the stabbing death of a 17-year-old student, Shebuel Jackson, in a crowded hallway. And last year, several months of disorder in the hallways culminated in a courtyard brawl in January in which seven students were arrested and an equal number were injured, none of them seriously.</p>
        <p>Although teachers and administrators said that incident was directly related to temporary reductions in the security staff, the school was out of control for a time, said Jeff Yonkers, president of the Mount Vernon Federation of Teachers.</p>
        <p>Even the district's elementary schools, once considered the only reliable part of the system, are not educating their children up to state standards, said Traci Gardner, the lead applicant for the proposed Academy of Excellence charter school. ''I think Mount Vernon is misinformed -- they think because the color of school board has changed, it's better,'' Ms. Gardner said. ''That's not true. Clearly it wasn't working before, but we need people who are committed to change.''</p>
        <p>Only about a third of Mount Vernon's fourth graders met state standards in English in 1999, and only 3 percent exceeded them. Scores were higher at Pennington, but lower than in previous years, with more than a third of the school's students falling below state standards.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gardner said she and a group of like-minded parents chose to apply for a charter in July after meeting with Mr. Ross and describing their frustrations with the public elementary schools. Their Academy of Excellence would enroll 243 students in its first year and would include kindergarten through third grade.</p>
        <p>Audrey Smart, the lead applicant for the Ambassador school, said similar frustrations had led her to apply. Ambassador would start off with 249 students in kindergarten through second grade and will focus on at-risk children, who tend to do poorly in Mount Vernon's public schools, Ms. Smart said.</p>
        <p>''A lot of these kids don't get any help until they get to high school; then they end up at Mandela,'' she said, referring to the Nelson Mandela school, a school for troubled children, which has been criticized for lacking adequate facilities.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gardner said that she had great respect for Mr. Ross but she did not think the school system could be reformed from within. ''The thinking should really be, If we can help 250 children, wouldn't that be better than letting all of them drown? Let's have another model you can use as an example.''</p>
        <p>In late September Mr. Ross met with Ms. Gardner and other members of the Academy of Excellence board and asked them to withdraw their application and join him in reforming the district from within.</p>
        <p>''I understand their frustrations,'' he said of the Ambassador and Academy of Excellence charter applicants. But he added that he believed charters would hurt the district, not help it.</p>
        <p>He said the district's schools were already showing signs of improvement. This year, 51 percent of the district's elementary students met or exceeded state standards in English -- a strong improvement over the previous year. At the Columbus elementary school, 90 percent of the fourth graders met or exceeded the standards in English in 1999, the best scores of any elementary school in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Ross has made extraordinary efforts to allay parents' concerns about the high school. He hired 15 security guards from a private concern for the high school, labeling them ''community service officers'' to avoid the teachers union's demand that the job be given to their members. He hired a new principal, Dr. Thomas M. Turner, who has instituted an innovative program that requires all students to identify their career aspirations at the beginning of ninth grade and write about them frequently. He has also instituted an ambitious new teacher-training program.</p>
        <p>So far, the new regime appears to be a drastic improvement over last year. At the high school, hallways that were crowded with rowdy class-cutters all day long are clear. Students wearing hats or chains outside their shirts get a quick reminder from one of the black-and-gray-suited security guards.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a big change, because now kids can learn,'' said Michaela Henry, 15, a 10th grader. ''They got all the hood rats out, and everything's under control now, so our test scores will go up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross plans to subdivide the high school, which has 2,324 students, into 5 separate schools, which will work independently, sharing a common gym and cafeteria. And all the district's schools will be renovated over the next few years, thanks to the $100 million bond issue.</p>
        <p>''It's revolutionary,'' said Adrienne Annunziata, an assistant principal who grew up in Mount Vernon and has taught here since 1972. ''He's a man with a mission,'' she said of Mr. Ross. ''We're hoping even if people don't like the man, they will get behind the mission.''</p>
        <p>Paul Court, who teaches advance placement History at the high school, said there would be no need for charters if the parents who once sent their children to Mount Vernon's middle and high schools would join in the reform efforts. ''If we could get people to send their children to the building -- and I think we can provide what they want -- they would become our greatest champions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That seems unlikely for the moment. But the frenetic pace of Mr. Ross's reforms has led some to wonder whether the charter schools -- which may never be approved -- are already fulfilling their promise to spur improvement through competition.</p>
