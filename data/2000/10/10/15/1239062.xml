        <p>WITH euphoria sweeping the newly liberated Serbia, President Clinton might have expected a hearty greeting when he phoned Vojislav Kostunica last week to congratulate him on the democratic revolution he led. The conversation was cordial enough, the Serbian leader's aides said, but Mr. Kostunica had a few sharp words for Mr. Clinton: Lift the sanctions now.</p>
        <p>Economic sanctions sting. When carefully applied and diligently enforced, they can work. Sanctions almost certainly contributed to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, who had survived the loss of four civil wars and a bombing by NATO. The Yugoslavia case could salvage the reputation of these shout-instead-of-shoot expressions of moral and political outrage.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that they played a significant role,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, the United States deputy Treasury secretary who took part in designing and administering the sanctions. ''They helped to bring down the economy and created the conditions that led to the uprising.''</p>
        <p>Exactly what prompted Serbians to vote Mr. Milosevic out of office and then take to the streets to enforce their will may take years to decipher fully. Some people argue that international pressure did more harm than good, creating a patriotic backlash that actually sustained Mr. Milosevic in power and postponed the day of reckoning.</p>
        <p>There is also no question that the sanctions inflicted collateral damage on people who were never supposed to be targets. Mr. Kostunica's stern comments to Mr. Clinton reflect popular anger at the United States because it led the sanctions campaign.</p>
        <p>At home, political sentiment has begun to turn against the use of trade and investment embargoes in all but the most egregious cases. Academic studies have shown that sanctions -- especially those applied by the United States alone without support from major allies in Europe and elsewhere -- rarely achieve the intended results even when left in place for many years.</p>
        <p>Multinational corporations have formed lobbying groups devoted to eliminating or easing sanctions on Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq and other nations. USA Engage, one such group in Washington, estimates that sanctions cost $15 billion to $19 billion in lost exports each year and that American companies employ 200,000 fewer people in high-wage, export-oriented jobs because of lost sales.</p>
        <p>But the Yugoslavia case could plausibly be remembered as the most significant success for economic sanctions since the fall of the apartheid regime in South Africa more than a decade ago. Yugoslavia could also provide a road map for how to achieve results and avoid common pitfalls.</p>
        <p>The NATO allies imposed a variety of sanctions on Yugoslavia beginning in 1992, during the war in Bosnia. The sanctions had so-called outer and inner walls, with the outer wall cutting off Yugoslavia from official aid and the inner wall, elements of which were added gradually, slapping restrictions on many Serbian companies and the Milosevic-linked elite.</p>
        <p>The sanctions also included restrictions on air travel and oil sales to Yugoslavia, though both were eased even before Mr. Milosevic's fall. Mr. Clinton and European leaders have promised to lift many of the sanctions now that Mr. Kostunica has come to power. The outer wall may remain in place until Mr. Milosevic stands trial.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant breakthrough in Yugoslavia was that the United States and Europe stuck together. Basic unity prevailed despite numerous battles behind the scenes and frequent modifications to the sanctions.</p>
        <p>The Western nations worked closely together to restrict commerce with state-owned companies, a major factor in the economic collapse that Serbia experienced after the war in Kosovo. The economy shrank by 20 percent in 1999, with inflation hitting 50 percent and almost one-third of Serbians surviving without regular work.</p>
        <p>Another lesson is that as far as sanctions go, the rifle outperforms the shotgun. Western powers identified about 300 members of the Serbian elite closely tied to Mr. Milosevic and barred them from traveling to the West.</p>
        <p>The ban forced businesspeople as well as the political and intellectual elite of this once relatively open Central European nation to choose between Mr. Milosevic and their ties to Europe. The crumbling of elite support may have helped undermine him.</p>
        <p>Sanctions inevitably remain a blunt instrument, especially when the goal is the replacement of a single leader. Serbia suffered through severe electricity shortages and an effective cutoff of medical equipment, a shortage that many Serbs believe led to unnecessary deaths. At least for a time, such sentiments helped Mr. Milosevic rally anti-Western support.</p>
        <p>Gordana Ristic, 35, a marketing executive in Belgrade who lost much of her business because of sanctions, said many Serbs felt a patriotic duty to defend their nation when sanctions were first imposed. That delayed what she described as an inevitable rebellion against Mr. Milosevic, though she did not deny that Serbs eventually rose up, in part because they tired of the pain and isolation.</p>
        <p>''We have an image of ourselves as Europeans, and not as poor Europeans, so that hurt,'' she said in a telephone conversation last week. ''But if you think we are going to thank the United States for doing this to us, you will be kept waiting.''</p>
