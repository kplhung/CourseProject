        <p>BRIBES are tricky. Well, not the bribes themselves. Deciding what constitutes a bribe and then whether you should pay one to do business in a foreign country -- knowing full well that if you don't, a less ethical competitor might -- can be the real quandary.</p>
        <p>Washington hasn't made it any easier. Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977, making it illegal for American companies to pay bribes to secure contracts in foreign countries. But the law leaves just enough ambiguity to allow for continued payments to grease the skids. In permitting ''facilitating payments,'' the law recognizes that a small amount of cash might sometimes be needed to expedite what it calls ''routine governmental action.''</p>
        <p>So, according to advice that the Justice and Commerce Departments offer on the Internet, the American government is as likely as not to look the other way if a foreign government official is slipped a few dollars to process visas or work orders; provide police protection; ensure smooth mail, phone or power service; protect perishable products; or schedule inspections.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the government says ''routine governmental action does not include any decision by a foreign official to award new business or to continue business with a particular party.'' (The full text of the government's advisory on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be found at http://www.usdoj.gov/ criminal/fraud/fcpa/dojdocb.htm.)</p>
        <p>To some experts, that guidance seems perfectly clear. ''You don't need a law to know when you step over the mark between a facilitating payment and a real bribe,'' said Frank Vogl, vice chairman of Transparency International, an organization that publishes an annual index that ranks countries from least to most corrupt, with the goal of increasing accountability.</p>
        <p>But to others, the law merely disguises a bribe by calling it something else. ''What's silent here is that facilitating payments are still illegal in that country because they're bribes,'' said Patrick J. Gnazzo, vice president for business practices at United Technologies in Hartford. ''And there isn't a country in the world that doesn't have a law on its books that says 'you may not bribe my government officials.' ''</p>
        <p>So if the law does not provide clear guidance, how can anyone decide how to behave? In particular, what do you do if you're an executive from a country that is regularly ranked among the least corrupt (say, Finland) and you want to do business in a country that is regularly near the bottom of the list (say, Nigeria)?</p>
        <p>The argument could be made that  in notoriously corrupt countries, the best thing to do is to adopt the local cultural norms. After all, don't you owe it to your shareholders to do what needs doing and pay what needs paying to land a lucrative contract? And if you reject that idea,  what victory is won for ethics if the host country simply decides instead to do business with your more evil competitor?</p>
        <p>''I've seen successful businesses who follow the policy 'if in Rome do as the Romans do' 100 percent, and I've seen businesses who strictly adhere to their home country policies everywhere they operate,'' said Walter Kuemmerle, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. ''Both of these types of businesses have been successful.''</p>
        <p>But Professor Kuemmerle warned that ''it's generally better to stay out of corruption processes for good than to go into them just tentatively.''</p>
        <p>''If the business decides to give in once'' -- assuming that it can rise above the morass later -- ''that strategy is definitely not going to work,'' he added. ''It's like a drug addiction. Once you signal that you're willing to play the game according to the local rules, it's very hard to reverse that policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gnazzo counsels taking a realistic view of doing business in a corrupt nation. ''Decide you're going to be patient,'' he said. ''That means that your stuff may stay on the dock for a period of time. And you might not be able to get the product out as fast as you would like to.''</p>
        <p>Even in the countries perceived to be the most corrupt, ''not everybody in that environment is corrupt,'' Mr. Gnazzo added. ''That's a starting point.''</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, United Technologies itself came under Justice Department investigation, though the department ultimately found no violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and dropped the matter. The action was spurred by a civil suit in which a former employee accused a United Technologies subsidiary of dismissing him for publicizing what he said were bribes to two Saudi princes to secure a contract; that case was settled out of court in 1993.</p>
        <p>Then, as now, the company had a strict rule against making illegal payments to obtain business.</p>
        <p>THE author of an article in The Economist earlier this year described with satisfaction that while in the early 1990's it took bags of cash to get through customs in Nigeria, on his most recent trip he only needed to hand over a ballpoint pen.</p>
        <p>But in the realm of corruption, such deflationary forces are rarely seen. The ante to play the bribery game is always rising. ''It goes up the next time and the next time and the next time,'' Mr. Gnazzo said.</p>
        <p>Or, as Professor Kuemmerle put it, ''Corruption is a never-ending story.''</p>
