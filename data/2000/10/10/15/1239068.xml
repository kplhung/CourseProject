        <p>When I was 11 and 12, my bedroom lay in a slanting, second-story afterthought grafted onto the back of a cavernous old house in Osage, Iowa. The only way into the room was through the one full bathroom in the house, and my window looked out past the garage and a back gate and onto the alley that ran behind Main Street.</p>
        <p>But it hardly mattered what my window looked out on. For on my side of the room, which I shared with one of my brothers, a collage of photographs began at the floor and climbed the walls and crawled across that sloping ceiling. The photographs were all of the Beatles, circa 1964. I don't remember whether I taped or pasted them up or whether they were held in place by the gusts of my desire. It was a desire so intense and unspecific that it seems utterly focused now. I didn't want to be John, Paul, George or Ringo. I didn't want to meet them or even, really, to see them play. This was north-central Iowa, after all, land of the impossible, the land that had risen up to smack Buddy Holly's plane.</p>

        <p>When I was 11 and 12, my bedroom lay in a slanting, second-story afterthought grafted onto the back of a cavernous old house in Osage, Iowa.

        <p>But it hardly mattered what my window looked out on. For on my side of the room, which I shared with one of my brothers, a collage of photographs began at the floor and climbed the walls and crawled across that sloping ceiling. The photographs were all of the Beatles, circa 1964. I don't remember whether I taped or pasted them up or whether they were held in place by the gusts of my desire. It was a desire so intense and unspecific that it seems utterly focused now. I didn't want to be John, Paul, George or Ringo. I didn't want to meet them or even, really, to see them play. This was north-central Iowa, after all, land of the impossible, the land that had risen up to smack Buddy Holly's plane.</p>
        <p>Nor was I ready to feel the way the lyrics of the Beatles' songs suggested I should feel about girls, though that would come soon enough. All I really wanted was to be suspended in the moment when the needle touched down on a Beatles single, when the stylus was still almost inaudibly stalking the joyful uproar hidden in those inner, closely concentric grooves. I wanted to hear those songs for the first time again and again, which is, perhaps, the condition of all earthly desire.</p>
        <p>What calls up these memories is, of course, ''The Beatles Anthology,'' the new book about the Beatles by themselves. Its text is the confluence of four separate voices, including John's, whose old words are made painfully fresh and living. The book provides a clearer look at one thing -- the quality of being a Beatle -- than any other book has done. In their own words, and humbly enough at that, the Beatles capture the inexpressible difference between them and the rest of us, which was that they were Beatles and we were not. They lived in the vortex created by their talent, and we were the high-pitched roar of the vortex as it swirled about them.</p>
        <p>For anyone, like me, who lived in the youth of that music, it comes as no surprise to realize that a substantial portion of one's life is a Beatles anthology. The songs have worn themselves smooth in my brain, and I find that memory has overproduced them, as if time were somehow doing Phil Spector's work. In fact, the songs are as brash as ever, full of spare, restrained excitement, and yet they were made with surprisingly few tools. What I find myself listening for now, on those rare occasions when I play the songs, is the ambient sound of the studio the Beatles recorded in. It's like listening for the presence of the past.</p>
        <p>I still haven't brought myself to watch ''Let It Be,'' to witness those final hours that weren't, after all, nearly so final as the night that John was shot. And, as I say, I rarely play the songs. There is almost no need. I know how good the Beatles were, how good they are, and if it's a touchstone you want, then try the opening bars of ''Ticket to Ride,'' which still ricochet through my head. It's hard to say what to call the coincidence of having been just the right age for that music at the moment it was being made. But whatever you call it, it has made all the difference to me.</p>
