        <p>THE doughboy gazes stoically through the mesh steel cage, unfazed by the clownish dent in his helmet or the bronze plaque leaning against his chest. He is surrounded by heads without pedestals, lampposts without lamps, eagles without perches.</p>
        <p>This collection of ghostly fragments of New York's past resides in a storeroom under the Triborough Bridge on Randalls Island, one of the three main storage areas used by the New York City Parks Department for the flotsam of public art -- pieces of vandalized monuments, neglected sculptures, cast-off finials and fences. The other Randalls site lies in the bowels of Downing Stadium, and therein lies the reason for a sense of urgency among those at Parks who care about these artifacts.</p>
        <p>The stadium faces demolition this fall under a plan to redevelop Randalls Island Park, and the objects must be out soon, perhaps as early as Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>Finding space in overcrowded city property and in a booming real estate market is making the task seem ''pretty desperate,'' said Jonathan Kuhn, director of art and antiquities for the Parks Department.</p>
        <p>''It's low on the totem pole of budget requirements,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''It's not a sexy item. We're canvassing the borough commissioners. It's clear to me Manhattan doesn't have space.''</p>
        <p>The Downing Stadium demolition is a catalyst. The building that houses another of the storage areas, in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, faces reconstruction later this year. Work is due on the Triborough in 2003, meaning that the doughboy's 25-by-25-foot area also will have to be emptied. So Mr. Kuhn is scouring the city for one large area to house all the Parks artifacts together. He has only one candidate, a bathing pavilion in Orchard Beach with extra rooms, but the temporary solution may be a tarpaulin-covered pen outside the stadium.</p>
        <p>The city did not even know what it had until officials took an inventory in 1997. Most of the items were cataloged and tagged by Mr. Kuhn and his antiquities department. But the Downing Stadium cache was never completely examined because of the area's debris and bad lighting, putting it somewhere near the realm of unknown treasure.</p>
        <p>On a visit the other day, a few bare bulbs cast dim light in the dank area under the  concrete stands. A water leak trickled loudly. A mass of material lay strewn about, looking somewhat less grandiose than the term antiquities implies. But they represent New York's monumental past, and testify to the idea that honoring the dead can nourish the living through public art. Given the city's relative youth, it's as close as New Yorkers get to the wealth of civic treasures from, say, a truly ancient place like Rome.</p>
        <p>Inside several cages were granite benches; two obelisks marking the Drake family graveyard from Joseph Rodman Drake Park in Hunts Point, the Bronx; a pair of wrought-iron cannon carriages from the Morris-Jumel Mansion in Washington Heights, Manhattan; original bricks from Bethesda Terrace in Central Park; iron gates, festooned with the initials E. W. B. from the E. W. Bliss estate in what is now Owl's Head Park in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn;  chunks of a fountain that briefly stood outside an Orchard Beach pavilion; and sections of wrought-iron bird cages from the Prospect Park Zoo.</p>
        <p>The Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, defended the city's treatment of the items.</p>
        <p>''You don't have the money,'' he said. ''It's a miracle we saved these objects and kept them at all.</p>
        <p>''The city is not the Vatican,'' he added. ''It does not provide repositories. There are no catacombs. Years ago, these items would have gone into the landfill.''</p>
        <p>The goal now is to put as many items as possible on public view, preferably in their original sites. But sometimes those sites have disappeared, been altered or adorned with replicas. So some items will be recycled for parts. Some will stay in storage, as models for repairs for re-creations. Some will be loaned, and still others may be sold or even given away to the public.</p>
        <p>Because not all the materials are intrinsically or aesthetically valuable, deciding what to do with them is not easy. Many variables must be weighed in deciding what to restore: an item's historical associations, the wishes of benefactors, the cost, the community's desires. Many of the restorations depend on private donations.</p>
        <p>AS for the doughboy, a 1923 statue, he is destined to return to his station in Highbridge, at the corner of Ogden and University Avenues, once money is found to restore his right arm and rifle and carry out the installation. A dozen doughboy memorials were established in New York neighborhoods after the Great War to honor local men who died, just as towns around the country and Europe built memorials in their main squares.</p>
        <p>The Highbridge doughboy was salvaged in the 1970's after suffering the damage and after plaques listing 21 local men who died were stolen.</p>
        <p>''Once you have an amputee, that's an invitation to finish the job,'' said Mr. Kuhn, whose job at times seems like one big reminder of New York's capacity to chip away at its monuments, or spray paint them, or steal them whole.</p>
        <p>Soaring metal prices in the 1970's and a municipal budget crisis led to much thieving, but Mr. Kuhn says monument vandalism has waned. He cites at least two dozen successful restorations in the last decade, thanks in part to the private donations that flow from better economic times and to more city financing.</p>
        <p>Keeping the doughboy company is Arthur Cunningham, formerly of Cunningham Park in Fresh Meadows, Queens. More specifically, it is a bronze bust of Mr. Cunningham, his hair brushed straight back, a bristle mustache on his upper lip, a three-piece suit on his torso. Mr. Cunningham, born in 1894, was a rising star in New York City politics. He was elected city comptroller with Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and died six months later, in 1934, after a heart attack while horseback riding.</p>
        <p>The statue went up in 1941. Vandals cut off its right ear. The Parks Department's monuments crew restored the ear. (Mr. Cunningham's widow was so traumatized that she asked that the statue not be put back, Mr. Kuhn said.) And the statue has been in storage since. Mr. Kuhn said enough time had passed that Mr. Cunningham should be returned to its granite pedestal, which, miraculously, remains standing.</p>
        <p>But there will be no going home for the man who wrote ''Home Sweet Home,'' John Howard Payne, actor, playwright and poet. The song became so famous that a bronze bust of Payne was erected 21 years after his death, in 1873. Vandalism propelled it into storage. Mr. Kuhn said the statue would be better off in the Home Sweet Home Museum in East Hampton, on Long Island, rather than in its original setting, Long Meadow in Prospect Park.</p>
        <p>One of New York's most beloved memorials is at Randalls Island. It is the 1897 marble copy of the original urn honoring the Amiable Child in Riverside Park near Grant's Tomb. The boy, St. Clair Pollock, fell to his death in 1797 from the heights over the Hudson River, according to one version, and his father (or perhaps uncle), George Pollock, buried him nearby. The deteriorating 1897 copy was replaced in 1967 by a granite version. A piece of the original headstone once listed as being in the Downing Stadium site has disappeared. The granite urn will stay in storage.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the saddest relics sit in another room in the Triborough Bridge site.</p>
        <p>They are hundreds of 4-by-8-inch bronze plaques marking trees planted to honor ordinary New Yorkers who died in World War I. The plaques are simple, all reading, ''This tree is dedicated to the memory of . . .'' followed by the name, rank, unit and the words ''who died in the World War 1914-1918.'' They carry names like William J. Hodgkins and Everett C. Scamman and Moses Opotofsky. No records about who installed the plaques have come to light, and no decision has been made on their fate.</p>
        <p>Planting trees to honor fallen heroes grew especially popular after World War I, and hundreds of such plaques still remain around the city. But almost immediately thieves began prying them up. Trees died, leaving a plaque with no object. So most of the plaques were salvaged and put in storage, Mr. Kuhn said, where they have lain for more 50 years, interred like the forgotten men they honor.</p>
