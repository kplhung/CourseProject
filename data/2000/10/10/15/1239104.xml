        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Brain Injury Association of New Jersey is all too familiar with the frustrations of people like Marilyn Gelman (''It's Brain Injury Month,'' Soapbox, Oct. 8) , suddenly unable to perform the ''simple tasks others take for granted'' because of a traumatic brain injury. Compounding the frustration is the fact that so few services and supports are available to people with brain injury that address their unique needs. State Senators Joe Kyrillos and Richard Codey and Assemblywoman Clare Farragher are sponsoring legislation  to establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Fund in New Jersey to help pay for some of these unmet needs.  These bills, which are receiving bipartisan support, will be formally introduced this week.</p>

        <p>The Brain Injury Association of New Jersey is all too familiar with the frustrations of people like Marilyn Gelman (''It's Brain Injury Month,'' Soapbox, Oct. 8) , suddenly unable to perform the ''simple tasks others take for granted'' because of a traumatic brain injury. Compounding the frustration is the fact that so few services and supports are available to people with brain injury that address their unique needs. State Senators Joe Kyrillos and Richard Codey and Assemblywoman Clare Farragher are sponsoring legislation  to establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Fund in New Jersey to help pay for some of these unmet needs.  These bills, which are receiving bipartisan support, will be formally introduced this week.</p>
        <p>To consider that Ms. Gelman and others like her are not represented among available brain injury statistics is staggering: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 5.3 million Americans -- 2 percent of the population -- live with a disability resulting from traumatic brain injury. How many more millions are among the ''uncounted numbers?</p>
        <p>Before long, we should have a more accurate census of people living with a brain injury that includes Ms. Gelman. Last month, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the incidence and prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury. The center also might consider developing a new term for the condition. As Ms. Gelman has demonstrated, the struggles of a person with such an injury are anything but mild.</p>
