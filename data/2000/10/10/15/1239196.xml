        <p>Many thrifty buyers self-defeatingly ignore auctions.</p>
        <p>Since the legalization and introduction of wine auctions in the mid-1990's, New York has pulled abreast of London, long the world's most active secondary market in wine.</p>
        <p>High rollers and high prices dominate sales held by the big archrivals: Christie's, with its merchant partner, Zachys, and Sotheby's, with Aulden Cellars. Still, there are opportunities for savvy money-saving.</p>
        <p>Take Christie's East, 219 East 67th Street (Second Avenue), where at 2 p.m. on Saturday Zachys Christie's will hold a modest 559-lot sale, with a scattering of consignments that could cost about $20 a bottle if the house met buyers' resistance and sold the wines at low estimates.</p>
        <p>Christie's East will offer a bargain one-hour tasting beginning at 12:30 p.m.: reservations, (212) 606-0473. For $40, you can sample many rare and fine wines: a deal worth, proportionately, hundreds of dollars if the wines were bought separately.</p>
        <p>''Christie's at Rockefeller Center focuses mainly on superb cellars and collectible vintage wines,'' said Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman, ''but for Christie's East the vision is to make it synonymous with affordable and good-quality wines for everyday consumption.'' For example, the low estimate on 12 bottles of 1978 Chateau Lanessan, a Bordeaux, is $200 (apart from the 15 percent buyer's premium and taxes).</p>
        <p>While blue chips are emphasized at auctions run by Morrell &amp; Company, a Midtown retailer, bargains may await patient and lucky buyers. Those who comb the catalog early and stay until deep afternoon when audiences sometimes thin out and bidding turns drowsy have a good chance to capture prizes.</p>
        <p>Morrell's next sale is Nov. 18. The company says it will feature a silent auction. You examine the bottles at your leisure, observing why the color and fill level might indicate high risk, write down your bid and hope you will get the wines at rock-bottom prices.</p>
