        <p>Reading Dave Anderson's column (''Subway Series? Slumping Yankees Will Need a Bye to Get There,'' Oct. 2) reminded me of the 1958 World Series in which Casey Stengel's Yankees, having lost the 1957 Series to the new Milwaukee (nee Boston) Braves, found themselves down, three games to one, in the 1958 Series, a position from which no modern team had come back to win.</p>
        <p>Casey was interviewed at the clubhouse with that then new (to Texas) gadget, television, and was asked after the third loss, ''Casey, what's the matter with your boys?''</p>

        <p>Reading Dave Anderson's column (''Subway Series? Slumping Yankees Will Need a Bye to Get There,'' Oct. 2) reminded me of the 1958 World Series in which Casey Stengel's Yankees, having lost the 1957 Series to the new Milwaukee (nee Boston) Braves, found themselves down, three games to one, in the 1958 Series, a position from which no modern team had come back to win.</p>
        <p>Casey was interviewed at the clubhouse with that then new (to Texas) gadget, television, and was asked after the third loss, ''Casey, what's the matter with your boys?''</p>
        <p>He replied, ''Well, boys, I tell ya; we ain't hittin', we ain't pitchin', and we ain't fieldin', but we ain't worried.'' He backed that up by winning the next three games and the Series.</p>
        <p>Parenthetically, I financed a year of medical school on my winnings, based on Casey's statement.</p>
        <p>It seems to me if the ghost of Casey Stengel is still extant, the Yankees, having lost 15 of their last 18 regular-season games, have the opposition just where they want them!</p>
