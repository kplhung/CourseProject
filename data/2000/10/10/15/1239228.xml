        <p>The State Education Department released the results of statewide tests in reading and mathematics last week, and the news was mixed. Scores climbed slightly on the eighth-grade math test, but dropped of the fourth-grade math test and the eighth-grade reading test.</p>
        <p>Only 40 percent of eighth-graders across the state met the math standards, a slight improvement from 38 percent in 1999. In reading, 45 percent of eighth-graders met the standards, down from 48 percent.</p>
        <p>Even on Long Island, with some of the best-performing schools in the state, eighth-grade reading scores dropped slightly. In Suffolk County, 53 percent of eighth-graders met the reading standards, down from 55 percent in 1999. In Nassau County, 58 percent of eighth-graders met state reading standards, compared with 61 percent last year.</p>
        <p>The biggest improvement for Long Island students came on the eighth-grade math test. In Nassau County, 57 percent of eighth-graders met state standards, up from 52 percent last year. Math scores also improved in Suffolk County, with 51 percent of eighth-graders meeting the standards compared with 45 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>Fourth-graders fared better across the state, with 65 percent meeting standards in math. But that was a decline from last year, when 67 percent met the math standards. The math scores of Suffolk County's fourth-graders dropped slightly, with 79 percent meeting the standards compared with 80 percent in 1999. In Nassau County, 85 percent of fourth-graders met the math standards, up from 84 percent last year.</p>

        <p>NUMBER TESTED -- The number of students who took each test.</p>
        <p>PERFORMANCE LEVELS -- Percentage of students in each category. Levels are ranked from 1 to 4. Students at Levels 1 and 2 fall below the standards, with those at Level 1 having serious deficiencies, and those at Level 2 needing extra help. Students at Levels 3 and 4 meet the standards. Those at Level 3 are on track to meet the state's high school graduation requirements, and those at Level 4 perform at consistently high levels.</p>
        <p>PERCENTAGE MEETING STANDARDS -- The total percentage of students who scored at Levels 3 or 4 in 2000 and 1999.</p>
        <p>CHANGE FROM LAST YEAR -- Total change in the percentage of students who scored at Levels 3 or 4 this year compared with 1999.</p>
        <p>Blanks indicate missing data. District and county summaries were calculated from individual school data provided by the state. Tables include all schools for which the state provided data. Data for some schools were not available.</p>
