        <p>Pinot noir is sometimes called a bridge wine because of its synergy with light through heavy dishes, from grilled salmon, roast chicken and grilled sausage to pork, lamb, duck (Long Island, of course) and beef.</p>
        <p>The '98 pinot from Osprey Dominion, in Peconic on the North Fork, is a bridge for another reason, too.</p>
        <p>Its medium-weight body defines it as a summer red, especially because the bright acidity, heightened by 10 minutes in the refrigerator's ice compartment, gives it a few degrees of peppy fruitiness.</p>
        <p>More important, now, in autumn, its concentrated flavor, itself meaty, occupies center stage, and imparts a sense of warmth (at least psychologically).</p>
        <p>Occasional successes aside, the pinot noir grape and Suffolk County are not yet comfortable with each other. A perusal of a comprehensive listing of East End wines on the market, found in the informative Wine Press, a free seasonal publication of the Long Island Wine Council (the producers' trade association) and the Times/Review Newspapers in Mattituck, points up how few and far between they are.</p>
        <p>As an investment, pinot noir, a temperamental grape, invites risk, agriculturally and financially -- there are regiments of good Burgundies plus California and Oregon pinots out there -- and is nowhere nearly as safe as such proved enterprises as East End merlot and cabernet franc.</p>
        <p>Still, Osprey Dominion's '98 pinot noir ($22) has cleared basic hurdles. Its aroma is patently tarry (with traces of licorice after the bottle has been opened and aerated for 10 minutes), smoky and pleasantly woody. All these features translate into the flavor. Red meats tame the tannins, as a fatty ground-chuck hamburger did last Sunday.</p>
        <p>The wine seemed to signal that it was finishing an early developmental phase. In six months, it should be more complex.</p>
