        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read Douglas Davis's article ''The Virtual Museum, Imperfect But Promising'' [Sept. 24] with great interest. The question is often asked, ''Why is the virtual museum so boring?'' I think we have overlooked the fact that we haven't yet given an answer to the question, ''Why is the museum so boring?'' When Mr. Davis says ''the cyber gallery is nearly always dense, confusing, difficult to navigate, devoid of passion and, worse, of intellect,'' I couldn't agree more. However, I still think that the experience a visitor is faced with in a ''real'' contemporary art center, gallery or museum could be described with similar epithets. Except, perhaps, for ''devoid of intellect'' -- in ''concrete'' gallery spaces, intellect can be abused, leaving the visitor with an uneasy feeling of having been ridiculed. Mr. Davis writes of a ''widespread insensitivity to intellectual exchange in a medium geared for it,'' but this attitude is just a continuation of a curatorial mentality that has been pervasive for a few decades. The concept of exchange or sharing of information seems to be a painful one for a class of people that has been so jealous of its power, that is, the power of information.</p>

        <p>Before most curators and directors start taking the Web seriously (and there are exceptions, such as the New Museum in New York City and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis), they should start taking the public seriously -- not as a quantifiable commodity or number of entries but as ''one person at a time.''</p>
