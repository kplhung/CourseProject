        <p>Several years ago, Jerry Stokes took on the task of organizing what he estimates to be a multibillion-dollar industry representing more than one million vendors and 100 million regular shoppers. He succeeded. Three years ago, he became the founding executive director of the National Flea Market Association, based in Charlotte, N.C. ''The largest flea markets dwarf the average-size mall,'' Mr. Stokes said.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Stokes will gather some 200 members from 32 chapters across the country in the Dallas area for three days of seminars on marketing, advertising and promotion. And Mr. Stokes and his members have more in mind than selling zucchini and antiques. They have hired a lobbyist to represent them in Washington.</p>
