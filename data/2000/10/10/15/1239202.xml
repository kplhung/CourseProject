        <p>Lou Piniella spent enough time with the Yankees as player, coach, manager and general manager that he was intimately familiar with the number of players who filed through the roster's revolving door. But he never saw anything like the influx of players who filed through the door this season.</p>
        <p>''I think they got themselves in a position where they needed to make changes,'' Piniella, the Seattle manager, said. ''I think if they would've stood pat it would have been the wrong decision. You give an organization like New York the credit for recognizing that and going out and doing the things in volume that they did. Without the changes, it would have been very difficult for them.''</p>

        <p>Lou Piniella spent enough time with the Yankees as player, coach, manager and general manager that he was intimately familiar with the number of players who filed through the roster's revolving door. But he never saw anything like the influx of players who filed through the door this season.</p>
        <p>''I think they got themselves in a position where they needed to make changes,'' Piniella, the Seattle manager, said. ''I think if they would've stood pat it would have been the wrong decision. You give an organization like New York the credit for recognizing that and going out and doing the things in volume that they did. Without the changes, it would have been very difficult for them.''</p>
        <p>Agreeing with Piniella is Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager and architect of the moves. ''No, I don't,'' he replied when asked if he thought the Yankees could have made the American League Championship Series without the moves they made during the season. Seven of the 25 players who are spending the weekend in Seattle came to the Yankees during the season, five in trades, two as free agents.</p>
        <p>''We felt strong about our club entering spring training,'' Cashman said, ''but probably like most clubs who feel they have a contender, the season tells you a lot along the way. The team was telling us it needed certain adjustments, and beginning mid-June we started the process of shoring up areas of need.''</p>
        <p>The hitting cried out the loudest for help, Cashman said. ''Our offense was struggling considerably,'' he said. ''We were in the bottom third of the league, not like we had been in the last few years where we were fourth or fifth in runs scored. We were not there at all. The main objective was to go out and find a fit that would help shore up our offense and eliminate the glaring deficiencies.''</p>
        <p>David Justice has made the biggest difference in converting a team that was pretending to defend its championship into one that was a legitimate contender for another World Series title.</p>
        <p>Acquired from Cleveland on June 29, Justice most recently demonstrated his clutch talent most recently the past several days. Last Wednesday, he banged a baseball high off the left-center-field fence at Yankee Stadium and triggered a seven-run uprising that prevented the Yankees from falling two games behind the Mariners. Then, in Friday night's game, he drove in three of the team's eight runs.</p>
        <p>On the day the Yankees traded for Justice, they were limping along at 37-35 and were in third place. They won 20 of their next 29 games, leapfrogging four games in front.</p>
        <p>Joining Justice as playoff newcomers with the Yankees are Luis Sojo, Jose Vizcaino, Glenallen Hill, Luis Polonia, Denny Neagle and Dwight Gooden.</p>
        <p>The Yankees made no major changes in either of the previous two seasons en route to the World Series championship.</p>
        <p>In 1998, they were 15 games ahead at the nonwaiver trading deadline and did not make a single acquisition. Last season, they signed Allen Watson as a free agent and traded for Jim Leyritz on deadline day, at which time they had a six-game lead.</p>
        <p>In 1996, before they won the first World Series of this period, the Yankees made some moves to bolster the roster, though nothing compared with the volume of this season's maneuvers. Their biggest move was the acquisition of Cecil Fielder from Detroit, and next was the addition of Darryl Strawberry.</p>
        <p>Fielder hit 13 home runs and drove in 37 runs in 200 times at bat. Strawberry slugged 11 home runs and knocked in 36 runs in 202 at-bats. Both hitters helped the Yankees nail down the division championship, but this season Justice exceeded their contributions. In 275 at-bats, he socked 20 home runs and drove in 60 runs. Hill, in a more limited opportunity, hit 16 home runs and knocked in 29 runs in 132 at-bats.</p>
        <p>Selig on Minority Groups</p>
        <p>With the managerial field wide open, Commissioner Bud Selig has reissued to the clubs his 1999 memo on minority interviewing. Selig is not telling clubs they have to hire members of minorities, but he has reiterated his policy that he expects the teams to interview them and submit to him lists of candidates for their vacant positions.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Detroit hired Phil Garner without sending the commissioner a list of candidates, and they paid for their transgression.</p>
        <p>Selig, in response to a question about the legitimacy of interviews, said, ''I expect them to be sincere.''</p>
        <p>That issue has been raised by some black and Hispanic candidates who have emerged from interviews feeling they had been token interviewees without any real shot at a job.</p>
        <p>Willie Randolph and Chris Chambliss of the Yankees are among the most highly visible black coaches who will be interviewed. The Reds, the Phillies and the Dodgers have received permission to speak with Randolph (the Pirates will supposedly also ask); the Dodgers and the Diamondbacks with Chambliss.</p>
        <p>As frustrated as the two Yankees coaches may be over their failure to be named managers after previous interviews, the strangest case involves Cito Gaston. He was the only manager between Sparky Anderson (1975-76) and Joe Torre (1998-99) to win successive World Series championships (1992-93), but he has been virtually ignored since the Blue Jays fired him in 1997.</p>
        <p>Will Lasorda Lure Valentine?</p>
        <p>The Bobby Valentine-to-the-Dodgers rumor surfaced again last week. Once again it is based on the strong connection the Mets manager has with Tommy Lasorda, a Dodgers senior vice president. Lasorda, the story goes, will use his influence to induce the team to hire Valentine away from the Mets.</p>
        <p>''It isn't so,'' a high-ranking baseball official said. ''Lasorda has little influence there or none.''</p>
        <p>Keeping Things Relative</p>
        <p>Talk about influence. Ruben Amaro Jr., the Phillies' assistant general manager, has participated in interviews with some of the candidates for the club's managing job. One of the candidates: Ruben Amaro Sr.</p>
        <p>The elder Amaro, 64 years old, has held a variety of positions over the years, serving as the Phillies' minor league field and defensive coordinator this year. He has never been a major league manager.</p>
        <p>''I tried to be as objective as possible, and I think I was,'' the younger Amaro said, recounting his unusual experience.</p>
        <p>''One of the things I learned from my father was to be as objective a person as possible, especially in baseball. You have your obvious bloodlines and ties to people. But I really believe my father is a candidate to help our team succeed and develop.''</p>
        <p>The son said he asked his father questions that they had never discussed privately, adding: ''I asked him what he could bring to the table. I was as candid as possible, trying to get as much information as possible.''</p>
        <p>As the session went on, the younger Amaro said, he found himself following parallel intellectual and emotional paths.</p>
        <p>''I was interviewing as if he was a baseball man, someone highly revered, trying to understand what his philosophies were,'' Amaro said. ''As he's answering the questions, just like any son or sibling or family member, I was hoping he was answering them the right way.''</p>
        <p>His post-interview assessment: ''I think he did a great job. I called him afterward and said, 'Dad, this might sound strange, but I'm proud of the way you presented yourself.' ''</p>
        <p>Before the interview, the assistant general manager disclosed, his father told him, ''I'm awfully proud that you're one of the people interviewing me.''</p>
        <p>Payrolls Still a Major Focus</p>
        <p>A club executive, in a recent conversation, expressed concern with the focus Bud Selig places on payroll disparity.</p>
        <p>The constant public discussion of the issue, the executive said, is not positive for the game.</p>
        <p>''Whoever said that is absolutely correct,'' Selig said. ''I worry about that all the time. I understand it's very sensitive. People don't want to hear about it. On the other hand, everyone knows there's a problem and I can't deny the existence of it.</p>
        <p>''Do I want to talk about it? No. But wherever I go, even big markets, that's the first question people ask. But I'm very careful. I also start out by saying we're in the midst of this great renaissance. The game itself has never been more popular, gross revenues are at an all-time high, we just did a remarkable television contract. It's a very delicate line I have to walk.''</p>
        <p>Then, in a continuing discussion of the link between payrolls and playoffs, the commissioner noted that the four remaining teams have the highest payrolls in their divisions. They also, according to the latest management figures, rank 1, 3, 8 and 10 in payrolls computed the way they were done for luxury tax purposes, when the luxury tax existed. The method adds the average annual salary of all players on a team's 40-man roster.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are first at $114.4 million, the Mets third at $99.7 million, St. Louis eighth at $88.9 million and Seattle 10th at $69.6 million. Conspicuous by their playoff absence are the Los Angeles Dodgers, who rank second at $105 million.</p>
        <p>''It is, to me, beyond discussion and beyond debate,'' Selig said. ''We do have a disparity problem. I think we have so much empirical data I can't imagine what other data we need. This year is further evidence.''</p>
        <p>It is such a problem for him, Selig added, that sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and peruses his payroll sheets.</p>
