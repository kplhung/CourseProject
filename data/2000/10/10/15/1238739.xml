        <p>Dr. George Preti first offers me armpit. Later, we'll get to ''swine slurry'' and halitosis, but we start with the odor that he claims is his favorite. Preti holds a small strip of clear material under my nose, saturated with 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, the principal ingredient in underarm odor. Smelling this strip is like savoring distilled gym locker, and not something you want to do often. Preti, who grins as I take it in, whiffs this stuff for a living.</p>
        <p>I have come to Preti's lab -- in the nonprofit Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia -- in search of science on a shoestring. The myth of medical research is colossal grants and egos to match, but I went looking for a scientist working on the margins, toiling away with meager funds against a condition everyone would just as soon ignore. I wanted someone on the front lines of fringe. Preti is it.</p>
        <p>He joined the Monell Center -- established in 1968 as one of the world's first research institutes on taste and smell -- in the early 70's, intent on exploring the chemical communication among mammals. Later trained by Dr. Joseph Tonzetich, a man he endearingly calls the ''godfather of halitosis,'' Preti began to focus on mouth odor and human secretions. In the mid-80's, he made international news for his work on how male and female armpit odors influence women's menstrual cycles. But like most nonindustrial research scientists, Preti's reputation needs constant caretaking.</p>
        <p>His research operation is but a draft compared with the gales of Big Science. Where other labs maintain huge server farms of coded genes, Preti has two fridges covered with cartoons and crammed with saliva, urine, swabs of exudates and other unmentionables. This year, the federal government will spend $3.8 billion to fight cancer and $528 million to fight diabetes. Preti will wage his war on stink with a total budget of $300,000.</p>
        <p>What keeps him going is the promise of cures for stenches both public and private -- but getting there requires a complicated bit of financing. The National Institutes of Health gives him $150,000 a year to support his primary research, the study of underarm odors. Of that, $95,000 is earmarked for his salary and those of two lab technicians, and the rest goes to supplies and research subjects, plus an annual trip to a convention in Sarasota, Fla.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, the State of Pennsylvania spends $80,000 a year on Preti, so that he might find a way to neutralize the stench of pig and mushroom farming. That money gets spent like this: $49,600 goes toward the salaries of Preti, a biopsychologist he works with and their two assistants; $20,800 goes to hiring two veterinarians, who consult on swine experiments; and $11,200 goes to supplies and, as Preti puts it, ''Paying subjects to sniff the stuff.'' (He recruits students, at $10 to $20 an hour, to smell the slurry and ascertain the degree of intensity of the smell. They go for nave students, Preti says, who don't have ''prejudicial attitudes toward slurry.'')</p>
        <p>On the side, with no official financing, Preti treats patients. His current fascination is an enzyme deficiency called trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as fish-odor syndrome. Those who suffer from it come to Preti for help, though there is no remedy to date. Others with breath problems make the pilgrimage from as far as Europe and Central America, failed by mints and mouthwash, obsessively covering their mouths and pleading for treatment. Though it costs him about $2,000 to see each patient, he charges them only $200, supporting the endeavor with a private honorarium stash.</p>
        <p>When I ask him why his work is not better financed, Preti says, almost shyly, that in large part it's because of ''the bizarre nature of my niche.'' Though the mouthwash industry is worth $850 million, he sees no part of it, because their research focuses on tooth plaque and gingivitis. Even in the world of dentistry, perhaps the one place where breath malodor might be a big deal, the condition is a sideshow. ''If you want to become a name in academic dentistry, are you going to study bad breath or carcinoma of the mouth?'' asks Preti.</p>
        <p>But what Preti's research lacks in economic scale it makes up for in practical application. The majority of Americans suffer from halitosis, at least occasionally, so Preti is, quite literally, putting his money where our mouths are. And he knows where all of that money goes, even down to the 50 cents it cost him for a set of Xerox copies.</p>
        <p>His biggest expenditures are on machinery that break down volatile gases -- a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. The chromatograph, which looks something like a boxy, oversize toaster oven, costs about $12,000. A syringe attached to it draws mouth air into a tightly wound, 36-foot-long, hair-thin coil made of Teflon called ''the column'' (which needs replacing, at a cost of $300 to $400, every 4 to 12 months). In the column, one's breath is broken down into its molecular compounds.</p>
        <p>Once the materials have been separated by the gas chromatograph, the mass spectrometer bombards the individual components with electrons, creating a ''fragmentation pattern'' to help identify their structure. The mass spectrometer is the Sherman tank of smell research; though it doesn't seem to have any moving parts, the machine costs between $70,000 and $100,000 and sits in the basement of Monell. (Days after I spoke with him, Preti was ecstatic, having just received the new ''desktop'' model he'd bought for $80,000.)</p>
        <p>But when I ask Preti what is the costliest thing in his lab, he points to the fellow standing next to him -- Henry Lawley, his technician. ''A machine you only pay for once,'' Preti says. ''A human being you have to keep paying for.'' Lawley smiles under the awning of his bushy gray mustache.</p>
        <p>Despite all the high-tech equipment, the best instrument Preti has is the free one. ''The nose,'' he says, ''is a lot more sensitive than the gas chromatograph or the mass spectrometer.'' And he uses it on every patient.</p>
        <p>Many of them have spent thousands of dollars just trying to get a diagnosis and often cry upon getting tested. ''The vast majority of physicians don't know how to diagnose an odiferous disease,'' Preti says. ''A lot of people think that bad breath is generated in the digestive tract, and that is utterly wrong.''</p>
        <p>As Preti describes it, the body has various chemistry departments, run by bacteria, and the bacteria make the odors. Depending on the amount of moisture, type of glands and amount of available oxygen, each body part smells different from every other part, and each person's bad smells are different from every other person's bad smells. The wet areas with lots of nooks and crannies, like the back of the mouth, are booming factories, teeming with volatile compounds like hydrogen sulfide (which smells like rotten eggs) and methyl mercaptan (which smells like sewer gas). ''These are the main ingredients in bad breath,'' Preti says. They form a plaque on the back of the tongue that he likens to ''cream cheese on a bagel, and just as hard to get off.''</p>
        <p>Preti evaluates each patient's breath, ranked on a scale of 1 to 10. He asks the patient to close his mouth for two minutes and then exhale into his face. This is the ''organoleptic'' method. ''At seven or eight, I can detect their breath in conversation with them across the table,'' he says. ''It's pretty strong.''</p>
        <p>I ask Preti to sample me. On my way to the center that morning, I sucked on a lone, lint-dappled cough suppressant I found buried in my bag, in preparation for just such an exam. But when Preti swabs my tongue with a long Q-tip, he can tell already that I'm near the top of the scale. He sniffs the secretion and mutters, ''Seven.'' Henry Lawley rushes over to get a whiff of me. ''I'd say four,'' he says, kindly. I, of course, can't smell a thing. (Even when we think we can smell ourselves, we are notoriously bad at estimating the strength of our foulness; women tend to exaggerate more than men, while men tend to have higher levels of odor than women.) ''Was it the two cups of coffee?'' I ask. Preti looks at me sternly. ''Coffee breath is not bad breath.''</p>
        <p>One of Preti's peeves is the way that ''food smells'' are now confused with ''bad smells,'' a distinction blurred by advertising and the mouthwash industry. ''In these ads, bad breath is often linked to something you ate like garlic, onion,'' he says, ''but I tell people, 'Eat all that you want -- those are good smells.' ''</p>
        <p>After a nose test, Preti gives the patient a piece of flavorless Wrigley's gum (a donation from the company) to generate saliva. The patient spits into a funnel that empties into a vial. Preti draws air off the top of the vial and sends it into the chromatograph, in what is called ''head space'' analysis. He also takes blood and urine samples. For those patients with body-odor problems, Preti uses absorbent pads in their armpits to sample their smell.</p>
        <p>So what does Preti actually do for people who smell? For those with TMAU, he recommends not eating beans or boiled fish, two foods that contain the compound that those with TMAU can't break down. Patients afflicted with genuine halitosis get lectures in diligent tongue scraping, raking the plaque right back at the threshold of the gag reflex. ''Nobody is taught from early age to clean the back of their tongue,'' he says. ''It's the best long-term solution.'' Preti adds that some cultures, like India's, do teach tongue scraping, and they have relatively lower incidence of halitosis.</p>
        <p>He also recommends a mouth rinse developed by Dr. Jon L. Richter, a practicing Philadelphia dentist who runs a breath clinic. Richter worked with Preti and spent more than $1 million to develop products that remove plaque on the tongue. To improve on Listerine, which Richter claims ''basically just irritates the mouth'' and doesn't get rid of tongue plaque, Richter created a chlorine-dioxide solution -- the same compound that sanitizes drinking water -- to kill bacteria and remove odors. The rinse is basically pool water, but it took ''hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' Richter says, to come up with the right proportions. They also developed a plastic tongue cleaner for raking off plaque. ''That first tongue scraper cost us about $20,000 just to get a mold,'' Richter says. ''Now it costs about 8 cents to produce.''</p>
        <p>Nonhuman stink problems are more formidable. In America's hog-farming states, the smell of ''swine slurry,'' which is a combination of feces, urine, food and mud, has become a genuine epidemic. Pollution from large hog farms, which dump the slurry into giant holding tanks euphemistically called waste lagoons, gained its greatest infamy last fall, when Hurricane Floyd caused tanks throughout eastern North Carolina to overflow. The waste -- and the stench -- traveled far and wide with the rising waters. But it's a serious day-to-day problem in any state where hogs are raised. To counteract the odor, Preti (who gets his slop free from a local swine farmer) has been experimenting with finely powdered charcoal (which he also gets free, from a local charcoal company) mixed into the slurry. It reduces odors by 90 percent, he says, but ''you still have enough to offend people.'' His latest idea is to possibly start with the other end of the pig -- the mouth -- and feed it a smell-annihilating charcoal tablet.</p>
        <p>Before I go, Preti wants me to understand what he's up against, to experience the real potency of swine slurry. He seems almost to delight in unscrewing the lid of a small container of it, a pea-green soup with little bits of bad news floating in the mix. He offers it to me as a farewell perfume. I bend in close, open my nostrils and breathe. The smell is awesome.</p>
