        <p>Why was there enough science in the 20th century to make this newspaper engage a whole staff of science writers and editors and produce a science section (Science Times) every week? Maybe because, as Stephen Jay Gould points out in his foreword to SCIENTISTS AT WORK: Profiles of Today's Groundbreaking Scientists From Science Times, edited by Laura Chang (McGraw-Hill, paper, $19.95), the sciences drew, for the first time, on a democratic pool of talent. In this country and others, bright and curious kids from poor homes or unfashionable backgrounds could rise through public university systems to the great laboratories and the glittering prizes. The 50-odd scientists profiled in this volume are an amazingly various lot, and so are their scientific enterprises, from proving Fermat's last theorem (it took 356 years) to trying to develop new experimental animals. One woman here, Anne Simon of the University of Massachusetts, is the science adviser to ''The X-Files.'' A couple, Kathy Schick and Nicholas Toth of Indiana University, make prehistoric-style stone tools and study whether a chimp can do likewise (so far, no). Theorists of everything and theorists of practically nothing abound, but in a way the most radical is Lene Vestergaard Hau of the Rowland Institute for Science, who has slowed the speed of light down to 38 miles per hour and is working on reducing even that.</p>
