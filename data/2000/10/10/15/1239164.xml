        <p>This afternoon's Boston College-Syracuse matchup was hardly a game for the Big East highlight reel. The starting quarterbacks were a combined 18 of 45 for an often wobbly 250 yards passing. The winning team gave up 306 yards on the ground.

        <p>This afternoon's Boston College-Syracuse matchup was hardly a game for the Big East highlight reel. The starting quarterbacks were a combined 18 of 45 for an often wobbly 250 yards passing. The winning team gave up 306 yards on the ground. When the game was finally  over, about all that was positive to say was this: It was a lovely, sunny day in New England for the 44,500 here at Alumni Stadium.</p>
        <p>For the Eagles, there was another positive aspect to the sloppily played game: they captured their first conference victory, 20-13.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to say it was pretty,'' said Boston College Coach Tom O'Brien, whose team improved to 4-2 over all and 1-2 in the conference. ''I know we have a long way to go in some areas, but it's a victory and that's all that counts.''</p>
        <p>The Orangemen have no such feelings. Their already disappointing season needs salvaging and that might be accomplished only by upending the conference powerhouses, Miami and Virginia Tech.</p>
        <p>''It's really frustrating,'' Syracuse defensive end Duke Pettijohn said. ''This was a Big East Conference game we needed to win. It's a real setback, and it's really disappointing.''</p>
        <p>Last week, Syracuse quarterback Troy Nunes threw the game-winning pass in overtime of a 24-17 victory over Pittsburgh. Against the Eagles, he threw four interceptions that led to two Boston College touchdowns. Nunes acknowledged the interceptions were the result of poor decisions rather than tough defense.</p>
        <p>In the second quarter, on his own 22-yard line, a pressured Nunes floated a ball into the flat that defensive back Lenny Walls intercepted at the 29-yard line and returned for a touchdown and a 13-3 Eagles lead. ''I got off a bit slow and I couldn't find a rhythm, and I then my confidence began to slip,'' said Nunes, who completed 9 of 22 passes for 134 yards. ''I kept making bad decisions.''</p>
        <p>Nunes threw interceptions on three of Syracuse's last four series of the first half and on its first series of the second half. His mistakes wasted strong performances by running backs James Mungro and Dee Brown. Mungro gained 155 yards and Brown, a senior, gained 105to move past Jim Brown to No. 11 on Syracuse's career rushing list with 2,125 yards.</p>
        <p>With 39 seconds left in the half, the Orangemen (3-3, 1-1) had a third-and-4 on the Boston College 7-yard line with a chance to tie the score at 13-13. Nunes rolled left and was pinched against the sideline. He forced a pass into triple coverage, and Ralph Parent snagged it for the first of his two interceptions.</p>
        <p>In the third quarter, Parent intercepted Nunes again as a prelude to one of the few pretty plays of the day. On third-and-9 on the Orangemen 45, Eagles quarterback Tim Hasselbeck lofted a 39-yard pass over the left shoulder of the streaking Jamal Burke, who made a juggling catch at the 6. On the next play, the sophomore tailback William Green sprinted around the left end for the touchdown and a 20-6 lead.</p>
        <p>Green had threatened to score on Boston College's opening drive, when he turned a simple dive over center into a 65-yard yard gallop to the Syracuse 8-yard line.</p>
        <p>''When I got to the sidelines, the guys told me I should have cut it to the corner and I wouldn't have got caught,'' Green said. Despite the second-guessing from his teammates, Green had 104 yards on 15 carries.</p>
        <p>With five minutes left in the third quarter, a rattled Nunes tried to rally his team. He had entered the game as the nation's third-ranked quarterback in passing efficiency, but at that point he had as many interceptions as completions.</p>
        <p>Nunes moved the Orangemen to the Boston College 20-yard line and, on third-and-1, threw across the field to tight end Aaron Lewis, who was alone on the 10-yard line. The pass was tentative, but Lewis brought it down and staggered into the end zone to narrow the score to 20-13 with 56 seconds left in the quarter.</p>
        <p>With 4 minutes 46 seconds left in the game, Syracuse tried a field goal. But Mike Shafer hooked his 34-yard attempt left.</p>
        <p>For Nunes, his long afternoon was near its disappointing conclusion.</p>
        <p>''Letting down my teammates is the biggest thing,'' he said. ''A Big East loss is huge for us, but letting down the 57 guys on the sidelines who came with me here feels worse.''</p>
