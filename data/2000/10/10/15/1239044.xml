        <p>Toxic contamination from a former dry cleaning supply building in Jamaica has spread nearly three-quarters of a mile, creating fears that unsafe drinking water from the past could be causing serious health problems today.</p>
        <p>''We are at ground zero,'' said Manuel Kaufman, president of Brinkerhoff Action Association, who has been alerting residents that the contamination could be linked to health problems in the neighborhood, including cancer. ''People are worried about this, and rightfully so.''</p>
        <p>The 4.5-acre property, at 107-10 180th Street, is owned by the West Side Corporation, which used it from 1969 to 1990 to store and distribute dry cleaning supplies, including perchloroethylene, or Perc, as it is known. The chemical can lead to health problems, including kidney and liver damage, and has been shown to cause cancer in lab animals.</p>
        <p>The Perc made its way into the soil near five large above-ground tanks where it was stored, probably through spills. Tests last year by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation found three areas of significant contamination on the site, and ground water tests this summer confirmed that the chemical had migrated to the southwest, beneath houses.</p>
        <p>The news alarmed people like Irving Hicks, who lives three blocks from the plant, because a small part of the neighborhood's drinking water came from local wells until they were closed in 1982.  ''They say our drinking water meets the standards now, but what about before?'' Mr. Hicks asked.</p>
        <p>State health and environmental officials said the chance of exposure to Perc was relatively low. Andrew English, project manager for the Environmental Conservation Department, said wells near the plant had been tapped before 1982 only in the summer and accounted then for only 1 percent of the drinking water. ''The site itself is heavily contaminated,'' he said. ''But by the time you reach the edge of the property, the Perc levels drop off dramatically.''</p>
        <p>The state plans to remove contaminants from the soil and ground water, which could take two to four years, but many residents and local officials fear that the damage has been done.</p>
        <p>State Senator Malcolm Smith, a Democrat from St. Albans, said at least 70 people on a block near the site had either died of or had cancer. At his urging, the State Department of Health began a cancer study last month among residents near the plant. The results are expected in one to two years.</p>
