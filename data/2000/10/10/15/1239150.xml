        <p>Fordham seemed to be out of its league as it prepared to play Yale yesterday in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The young Rams, members of the Patriot League, came into the game with a 2-4 record, including last week's 27-point loss to Brown, the 1999 co-Ivy League champion with Yale. The veteran Bulldogs were 3-1, with their only loss coming by a point to Cornell.</p>
        <p>Instead of launching a rout, Yale had to rally against Fordham, relying on 185 yards and 2 touchdowns by tailback Rashad Bartholomew to survive, 24-17, before a Homecoming Day crowd of 5,837 at Jack Coffey Field.</p>
        <p>Fordham, which trailed by 14-7 at halftime, scored 10 unanswered points in the third quarter and led, 17-14, going into the final period. But Bartholomew, a bruising runner who came into the game ranked second in Division I-A with a 181.8-yard rushing average, kept building up steam on this unseasonably warm day.</p>
        <p>He was the key figure in a 13-play, 58-yard scoring drive that put Yale ahead for good.</p>
        <p>The 205-pound Bartholomew amassed 41 yards on 7 carries and quarterback Peter Lee connected on 2 of 3 passes for 19 yards as Yale drove to the Fordham 3-yard line. From there, Bartholomew bowled through the right side and into the end zone, giving Yale a 21-17 lead with 10 minutes 39 seconds left in this well-played game.</p>
        <p>With less than four minutes left, Yale increased the lead to 24-17 on a 31-yard field goal by Mike Murawczyk. Again, Bartholomew, who transferred to Yale after two years at the Air Force Academy, played a major part in the nine-play, 73-yard drive. He executed a slashing 48-yard run to the Fordham 32-yard line during which he ran over two Fordham tacklers, something he did often while running 27 times.</p>
        <p>''I got down low and ran the first guy over,'' Bartholomew said in describing how he broke through the left side of the line and cut toward the sideline. ''Then I had a big hole and went right through the safety. The hotter the day got, the better I guess I did.''</p>
        <p>Fordham (2-5) could get only to its 27- and 20-yard lines on its final two possessions before Yale ran out the clock.</p>
        <p>The loss did not detract from a solid performance by Fordham quarterback Mike Mucci, an 18-year-old freshman from St. Peter's Boys High School on Staten Island. Mucci connected on 13 of 28 passes for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>After throwing 13 interceptions in Fordham's first six games, Mucci did not have any today.</p>
        <p>In fact, Fordham did not have any turnovers, while Yale had three, two of which led to the Rams' first 10 points.</p>
        <p>Mucci said Rams Coach Dave Clawson had stressed possession during the week.</p>
        <p>''He told us that if we protected the ball, we'd be in it against Yale,'' said Mucci, who had a 29-yard touchdown pass to Javarus Dudley in the first period and an 18-yarder to Kendall Greer in the third. ''The interceptions were killing us.''</p>
        <p>The freshman's performance drew praise from both coaches.</p>
        <p>''Mike did a great job with no picks,'' said Clawson, in his second year as the Fordham coach. ''He's going to be a fabulous quarterback.''</p>
        <p>Yale Coach Jack Siedlecki said: ''You can see he's going to be a very good quarterback.''</p>
        <p>Just as effective at quarterback was Lee, a 6-foot-5-inch junior who transferred to Yale after one year at Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Given ample time to throw by his strong offensive line -- a luxury that Mucci did not enjoy -- the left-handed Lee completed 18 of 31 passes for 218 yards and 1 touchdown. He threw a 4-yard toss to Eric Johnson to give the Elis a 14-7 halftime lead.</p>
        <p>But the difference was Bartholomew, who scored Yale's first touchdown on a 1-yard plunge to tie the score at 7-7 with 6:50 left in the first half.</p>
        <p>He tied Rich Diana and Chris Kouri as the only Yale backs to gain more than 100 yards in five consecutive games.</p>
        <p>With the yardage he gained yesterday, Bartholomew passed Diana and is second only to Dick Jauron, now the coach of the Chicago Bears, in career rushing yardage. With five games remaining, Bartholomew, with 2,761 yards rushing, is within 186 yards of Jauron. For Bartholomew, that could be just another day's work.</p>
