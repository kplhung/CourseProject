        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for publishing the conversation between Mary-Louise Parker and Joe Mantello [''On the Proper Education Of Actors (and Audiences),'' Oct. 8], which was on target about so many aspects of theater, especially about audiences. In recent years I've been dismayed by unmannerly audiences and have tried to do my bit to educate, only to be met by stares, sneers and giggles. Most recently, when I tried to quiet some people behind me who were conducting their own critique of the performance while it was going on, I was met with, ''What's your problem?'' Perhaps, in addition to the pre-performance announcements about cell phones, beepers and candy wrappers, there could be a request that the audience maintain silence.</p>
