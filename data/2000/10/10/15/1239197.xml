        <p>New players. New attitude. New direction.</p>
        <p>You guessed it -- same results.</p>
        <p>Disappointing their new owners, 16,297 fans and most of all themselves tonight, the Islanders skated to a 2-0 loss to the Calgary Flames in their first sold-out home opener at the Nassau Coliseum since 1997.</p>
        <p>''We all wanted a Hollywood ending,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring said. ''I think we're learning a hard lesson right now; we're learning how hard we have to work to be a successful hockey club. A little more talent doesn't mean anything if you don't apply yourself. ''</p>
        <p>The hero's welcome for the owners Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar of Computer Associates dissipated into frequent boos for the Islanders, who dropped to 0-2-1 on the season as the Flames won their first game in four starts.</p>
        <p>''There was a special feeling generated by the response the fans gave the owners,'' said goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, making his first appearance in an Islanders home jersey. ''We would have liked to put in a better showing.''</p>
        <p>But the Islanders continue to resemble more of a work in progress.</p>
        <p>Despite a solid game in goal by Vanbiesbrouck, who made 26 stops, the game was a series of missed chances. The Islanders' power play was 0 for 8 tonight to become 0 for the season on 20 chances.</p>
        <p>The Flames, who had lost their only three games, all at home, came out shooting. The Islanders, however, did not get a shot on goal until more than half the first period had passed.</p>
        <p>The Flames scored at 9 minutes 18 seconds of the first period when Dave Lowry flicked the puck over the sprawled Vanbiesbrouck on assists from Cory Stillman and the former Islander Niklas Andersson.</p>
        <p>They went ahead by 2-0 at 14:07 of the second period when Roman Hamrlik fell after he and Kenny Jonsson clipped skates at mid-ice, leaving Stillman wide open to score on the cross-ice pass from Valery Bure. ''I came too far over to his side, and we collided,'' Jonsson said.</p>
        <p>The Islanders were not without good scoring chances. In the opening minutes alone, Brad Isbister's 30-footer went wide, Dave Scatchard could not tee it up from 10 feet out, and Hamrlik, who made a terrific save in the crease to stop a sure goal while Vanbiesbrouck was caught out of the net, sent a hard shot from the blue line ringing off the crossbar.</p>
        <p>The Islanders came to life in the third period, holding the Flames to a single shot and sending Fred Brathwaite scrambling to make desperate saves on a dozen shots on goal. But other shots seemed to come a half-second too late and often plunked into the side of the net.</p>
        <p>''We created some chances; we have to move the puck a little quicker,'' Hamrlik said. ''We've had three games, and what we have to do is find a way to score more goals.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Defenseman YEVGENY KOROLEV, who had not played in the first two games, was assigned to Chicago of the International Hockey League, leaving the Islanders with six healthy defensemen. . . . Saturday marked CLAUDE LAPOINTE'S 600th  National Hockey League game  and 312th as an Islander. . . . Last season the Flames won both meetings with the Islanders, by 3-2 at Calgary and by 5-0 at the Coliseum.</p>
