        <p>FEMALE sexuality is the great fearsome force at the center of the culture war: the social history of the past two decades is written on the bodies of women.

Even the locker room of government, with its pervasive scent of masculinism and Victorian hypocrisy, has been invaded not only by women seeking to join the team, but by sex uncensored and unsublimated.

The meal begins with a small wrangle in which Runyon orders steak for Hanson and she finds herself having to insist on the vegetarian dish she wants. She then indignantly confronts him: she has found out that he is planning to derail her nomination with salacious photographs and depositions claiming that back in her college days she performed oral sex on a group of boys at a party. Unmoved by her contempt for such tactics, he rails at the ''deviant sex'' in the pictures. Afterward, making her exit, she flashes him a wonderfully playful smile.

        <p>A scene in Rod Lurie's engrossing new movie, ''The Contender,'' says it all. Joan Allen as the liberal Democratic Senator Laine Hanson, the President's choice to make history by replacing the deceased vice president, has lunch with Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), the right-wing Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, who is determined to block her confirmation. The meal begins with a small wrangle in which Runyon orders steak for Hanson and she finds herself having to insist on the vegetarian dish she wants. She then indignantly confronts him: she has found out that he is planning to derail her nomination with salacious photographs and depositions claiming that back in her college days she performed oral sex on a group of boys at a party. Unmoved by her contempt for such tactics, he rails at the ''deviant sex'' in the pictures. Afterward, making her exit, she flashes him a wonderfully playful smile. Her expression melds a sharp intelligence with a vivid eroticism that for female politicians of a certain age is as deviant as can be. Sardonically, she suggest that the last thing he should want is a woman with her finger on the button who is sexually deprived.</p>
        <p>''The Contender,'' which opened on Friday, addresses a question that, while quite serious in its implications, also makes for a great feminist parlor game: what would happen if a politician at the center of a sex scandal were a woman? But that question becomes a stand-in for a larger one: what happens to the political game when sex and feminism are in play? Political sex scandals, in themselves, are nothing new. After all, the Grover Cleveland ''Ma! Ma! Where's my pa?'' episode took place in 1884; and in my lifetime, Congress has had its share of flaps, what with pages being seduced and House members' mistresses finding their way onto the federal payroll or getting drunk and cavorting in the Tidal Basin. What's new is that in the wake of the sexual and feminist revolutions -- and the backlash against them -- the breakdown of taboos against explicit sexual references in the news media has coincided with the loss of a social consensus on sexual norms.</p>
        <p>The question of when politicians' private sexual behavior becomes the public's business is now inseparable from our battles over what those norms should be. High-minded journalists scold tabloid TV and the Internet for breaking scandal stories (in ''The Contender,'' Shelly Runyon leaks his information to a Matt Drudgelike Web site), yet the mainstream press can't resist following suit, and not only out of fear for its circulation. Scandal has become a means of exposing the fault lines of the culture, the collision of personal and political. A semen stain on a dress, an alleged pubic hair on a Coke can are the stuff of public debate and national crisis.</p>
        <p>In this sense, the era of the modern sex scandal began with Ted Kennedy's car crash at Chappaquiddick -- or more precisely, with its role in the 1980 presidential campaign, when Mary Jo Kopechne's death and Mr. Kennedy's reputed philandering were raised as a feminist issue in his primary battle against Jimmy Carter. Eight years later, Gary Hart's forced departure from the presidential race after reporters exposed his affair touched off a passionate debate about a candidate's right to privacy. But it was only in 1991, with the furor over Anita Hill's accusations against Clarence Thomas, that the crumbling borderline between public and private, and the issue of a candidate's sexual ''character,'' assumed the centrality that would make it the defining theme of the Clinton era, from the near-disaster of Gennifer Flowers to Paula Jones' lawsuit to the denouement of impeachment.</p>
        <p>''The Contender'' opens by self-consciously invoking this history. Jack Hathaway (William Petersen), a charismatic ''man's man'' governor, an old friend of Runyon's, and Laine Hanson's chief rival for the vice presidential nod, is fishing when a car plunges off a nearby bridge, with a woman trapped inside. Hathaway immediately dives in, but can't get the car door open, and the woman drowns. His supporters can't suppress an unseemly glee: surely his heroic effort should clinch his nomination. But President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) tells him bluntly that the incident has disqualified him: it's his failure to save the woman that will stick in people's minds. ''We can't have another Chappaquiddick,'' explains the presidential aide Kermit Newman (Sam Elliott).</p>
        <p>It's unclear whether President Evans, a somewhat mysterious figure, is leveling with Hathaway or just presenting a rationale for doing what he wanted to do anyway -- secure his legacy by appointing the first female vice president. What is clear is that we have entered America's post-impeachment landscape, where politicians armed with competing interpretations of the same events struggle to define ''character'' to their own advantage.</p>
        <p>The denizens of this terrain rarely say what they mean or mean what they say. The president's chief operatives are closet Hathaway supporters; Kermit Newman goes so far as to tacitly signal Runyon that his friend might still have a chance. A young Democratic Congressman agrees to betray his party to get a seat on Runyon's committee. Runyon and his allies orchestrate the Hanson scandal without ever leaving a fingerprint. And the movie's surprise ending reveals that even Hathaway's attempted rescue was not exactly what it seemed.</p>
        <p>Against this background, Laine Hanson represents unbending principle. Despite her social liberalism, she voted to impeach President Clinton on the grounds that if members of the Joint Chiefs have been punished for adultery, there should be no double standard for the Commander in Chief. She has switched from the Republican to the Democratic party, presumably over abortion and other social issues, making dangerous political enemies. Throughout her confirmation ordeal she frustrates the President and his men by refusing to defend herself against sexual vilification -- even when handed a tempting opportunity to get off the hook -- because answering questions about her personal life would imply that it was legitimate to ask them. When Runyon's wife, who turns out to be a crypto-feminist sympathizer, gives Hanson some personal information to use against him at the hearings, she can't bring herself to do so.</p>
        <p>This portrayal has its problematic side: you don't after all become a Senator by holding yourself aloof from the boys' political games; and it would seem to have taken Hanson an awfully long time to figure out that the Republicans had been taken over by the right. The hokiest moment of the movie comes at the end, when President Evans makes a ringing let-us-go-forth speech on behalf of his nominee, hailing righteousness and truth and regretting that he never challenged Runyon with those resonant words, ''Have you no decency, sir?'' As with Michael Douglas in ''American President,'' an exemplary woman has spurred him to transcend business-as-usual political maneuvering and rededicate himself to democratic ideals. (Americans, or anyway liberals, love this fantasy.) The scene implies that President Evans has won over the House with his stirring rhetoric, though we have just seen him achieve victory for Hanson by sandbagging Runyon with a classic piece of political manipulation. While I'd like to believe the irony is deliberate, I see no evidence of this.</p>
        <p>Yet finally it doesn't matter, because the movie belongs to Joan Allen and Gary Oldman, whose characters at every turn burst the bounds of the pillar-of-rectitude-versus-wily-pol scenario to tap into the passionate energy of cultural conflict. Mr. Oldman, crackling with electricity as a right-wing fanatic cum brilliant tactician, wields courtliness like a razor blade, oozing disingenuous sympathy at one moment, launching into ferocious interrogation the next.</p>
        <p>AS for Ms. Allen's Laine Hanson, she is that rarest of beasts in our present popular culture, a committed feminist who is a juicy, complicated, unapologetically sexual human being. Her refusal to budge on the issue of responding to her tormentors comes less from abstract principle than from a very personal rage at being subjected to a double standard: if she were a man, no one would care what sexual flings she had in college, nor would supposed allies urge that she confess and preach against the dangers of alcohol. (Indeed, her attitude is more uncompromising than that of the film itself, which in another plot twist at the end betrays its own queasiness at the idea of a female vice president with a raunchy past.) When Runyon uncovers the fact that Hanson had an affair with her husband while he was still married to her best friend, she is clearly genuinely pained at having hurt -- and lost -- her friend; but she won't pretend to be sorry that she fell in love. In an age of overbearing political religiosity, she is also a matter-of-fact atheist.</p>
        <p>Hanson is vulnerable, capable of being rattled: under relentless badgering about whether she might have another child in the White House, and if she would take maternity leave, she finally blurts out that she and her husband use birth control -- an answer to a personal question if there ever was one. But on a deeper level she resists intimidation. She insists on being herself in a way that is an implicit comment on both Clintons.</p>
        <p>Could a woman with qualities like these really have a shot at the vice presidency? A silly question: look what happened to former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, just for letting us in on the big news that teenagers masturbate. But social progress is also measured by the fantasies that are allowed to be expressed in public. Joan Allen brings to the screen our culture's perennial nightmare: the woman who is both sexual and powerful. She is an update of Katharine Hepburn in ''Woman of the Year,'' but unlike Hepburn she gets to keep the sexuality without giving up the power. Instead, it's the power of the nightmare that's diminished.</p>
