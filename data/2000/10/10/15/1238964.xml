        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Out for a night at the theater recently, many of those in the seats around me, apparently having discovered that ''Cats'' had closed, had found their way across the river to BAM and discovered a production of Shakespeare's ''Richard II.'' Determined to have a good time, they stayed anyway. And taking their cue from Ralph Fiennes's somewhat over-the-top spoiled-brat Richard, they began to laugh in the first scenes and didn't quit until near the end.</p>
        <p>The performance was regularly interrupted by bursts of laughter, guffaws, squeaks and knowing humorous rumbles and moans. At the line ''What must the king do now?'' audience members giggled. In the ''For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground'' speech, the kings ''poisoned by their wives'' set the house on a roar, as did all those other wonderfully comic lines with which ''Richard II'' is replete. Too bad the play wasn't ''King Lear.'' The blinding of Gloucester would have produced paroxysms, and the sight of dead Lear would have convulsed my fellow ticket buyers. Every time an actor took a dramatic pause, I expected laughter, and was seldom disappointed.</p>

        <p>Audience members were quiet at the end, however -- probably worn out with laughing, and wondering why a comedy ended with a dead body right there on the stage. But dead body or no, and even without a jig or a tale of bawdry, they gave a standing ovation (that Mr. Fiennes is one funny guy, and Shakespeare, a gas) and brayed ''Bravo!'' A good time was had by all.</p>
