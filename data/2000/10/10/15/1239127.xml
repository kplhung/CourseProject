        <p>Tackling one of the top health scourges in the world, officials from 191 governments are gathering next week to begin negotiating a new global treaty aimed at controlling the use of tobacco and curbing smoking, especially among adolescents.</p>
        <p>Over the past few days, major tobacco companies and anti-smoking groups drew the lines for yet another battle over smoking. The World Health Organization, which is spearheading the push for a tough international agreement to curb smoking by 2003, made its views plain. It wrapped conference papers in a cover that took direct aim at the best-selling Marlboro cigarette brand. Silhouetted against an orange sky, one cowboy tells the other, ''Bob, I've got cancer.''</p>
        <p>The agency also became the first United Nations body every to hold two days of public hearings on tobacco which were dominated by anti-smoking groups. Philip Morris, which makes the top-selling Marlboro brand, and British American Tobacco (BAT) were unusually contrite, acknowledging that their products are deadly and addictive.</p>
        <p>They made clear, however, that they will resist stringent global rules, insisting that they are free to sell and advertise their wares. ''Today, with near-universal awareness of the health risks, a billion adults choose to smoke,'' said Christopher Proctor, BAT's science director, who argued that regulatory schemes can only work at the national level.</p>
        <p>The negotiations here will be fierce, tussling over whether to ban tobacco multinationals from advertising and sponsoring sports events; whether to increase taxes to make cigarettes more expensive, and whether to discourage tobacco growing and adopt measures to deter young people from smoking.</p>
        <p>The World Health Organization maintains that tobacco use already kills four million people annually and will worsen over the next two decades. Unchecked, tobacco's death toll will rise to 10 million yearly by 2030, according to the agency, which would take huge chunks out of budgets of both rich and poor countries.</p>
        <p>American medical groups have argued in recent days that the consequences of inaction are dire, and urged the Clinton administration to apply its tough domestic smoking stand to the international arena. ''If smoking is not curbed, China alone will have one million lung cancer deaths in 2025,'' said Dr. Randolph D. Smoak, Jr., president of the American Medical Association, who recently returned from China, where about 70 percent of men smoke.</p>
        <p>The strategy of big tobacco firms appears to be lobbying national governments, which may prove vulnerable to the companies' influence, and counting on the fact that any global agreement is only as good as the number of countries that sign on, ratify and implement provisions -- which, at best, is years away.</p>
        <p>A proposal to raise taxes on cigarettes in order to cut consumption, especially among the poor, the young and the less educated -- a method favored by the World Health Organization and the World Bank -- is likely to run into stiff resistance.</p>
        <p>A report by the two organizations last August maintained that tax increases do not lead to job losses and increase smuggling, two arguments advanced against the measure.  Based on the study, its authors will argue that a 10 percent rise in cigarette prices would lead to as many as 42 million people quitting smoking, and prevent about 10 million tobacco-related deaths. Such tax increases could also combat wholesale smuggling, which now amounts to around 355 million bootleg cigarettes yearly.</p>
