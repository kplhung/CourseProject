        <p>The Port Washington school district has a national reputation for diversity and open-mindedness; we should keep it that way. So we were surprised and distressed when we first heard about the school board's decision to ban Julia Alvarez's novel ''In the Time of the Butterflies'' because it included a drawing showing how to build a bomb [''School Board Questions Fitness of Book Because of Bomb Diagram,'' Oct. 1].</p>
        <p>Ironically, we read ''In the Time of the Butterflies'' last year in the book club at Schreiber High School, where we are students. In fact, there is a review and recommendation of the book posted on a page of the school district's Web site, http://www.PortNet.k12.ny.us/schools/schreibr/ slmc/Book Club.htm#In the Time of the Butterflies. The powerful story is what we remember a year after reading the book, not the illustration of a bomb.</p>

        <p>The Port Washington school district has a national reputation for diversity and open-mindedness; we should keep it that way.

        <p>Ironically, we read ''In the Time of the Butterflies'' last year in the book club at Schreiber High School, where we are students. In fact, there is a review and recommendation of the book posted on a page of the school district's Web site, http://www.PortNet.k12.ny.us/schools/schreibr/ slmc/Book Club.htm#In the Time of the Butterflies. The powerful story is what we remember a year after reading the book, not the illustration of a bomb.</p>
        <p>We believe that the purpose of education is to expose students to all areas of reality so that we can make our own judgments. Isn't that why we are able to read ''Romeo and Juliet'' without committing suicide or ''The Lord of the Flies'' without being violent? We should not ban a powerful piece of literature just because of a diagram.</p>
        <p>We understand the concern about violent behavior in our schools and are supportive of measures to remedy the problem. Nevertheless, removing a book from our school will not, and cannot, erase violence from society.</p>
        <p>''In the Time of the Butterflies'' should be taught at Schreiber. If the controversial portion of this book, or any other book, is discussed in context, students are most capable of putting it in perspective. We must be free to discuss and confront reality if we are to make positive changes for our future.</p>
