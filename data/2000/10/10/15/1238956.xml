        <p>A GOOD quality paintbrush or roller can last a lifetime if it is carefully cleaned and stored after each job. Unfortunately, most do-it-yourselfers look on brush and roller cleaning as a tedious chore and they do it in a rather haphazard manner. This is unfortunate because improper cleaning leaves paint that  will eventually clog the fibers so the brushes and rolls eventually become useless.</p>
        <p>It is not very difficult to clean either a brush or a roller, but the task is often messy and time consuming. It will be easier if you start by buying quality products.</p>
        <p>Buy brushes with nylon bristles for latex and water-based paints, and natural bristles for oil-based paints. The best quality rollers have either lamb's wool or ram's wool nap attached to a sturdy cardboard or plastic sleeve.</p>
        <p>Before using a new brush or roller, dip it in water (for water-based paints), or mineral spirits (for oil paints) then work the bristles or nap to remove loose fibers. Use a spinner, a pump-like device (available in paint store and home centers) to spin the painting tool and remove the excess solvent.</p>
        <p>A brush should be cleaned immediately after use. First remove excess paint from the bristles by scraping the sides of the brush on the rim of the paint can. If you have been painting with water-based paint, immerse the brush, up to the metal ferrule, in clean soapy water. Work the bristles with your fingers to remove as much paint as possible from between the fibers. If paint is stuck in the ferrule, you can use an ordinary fork to work it loose and dislodge it.</p>
        <p>Rinse the brush in a container of clean, warm water to remove all the soap in the bristles. If there is any paint or soap remaining, repeat the rinse in a third container of warm, clean water. Finally, clamp the handle of the brush in the spinner and spin it for about 15 seconds.</p>
        <p>Finally, reshape the bristles with your hand, then wrap the brush in the cardboard sleeve the brush was originally packaged in. The sleeve will absorb any excess moisture and it will hold the brush in the proper shape as it dries. If you don't have the original sleeve, you can make a substitute out of heavy paper. Fold it to enclose the bristles then secure it with a rubber band.</p>
        <p>Natural-bristle brushes can benefit from an application of ordinary hair conditioner; this will not work with synthetic fibers. Follow the directions on the package for application and rinse. The conditioner will help keep the bristles flexible and maintain the brush's shape.</p>
        <p>The procedure for cleaning oil paint from a brush is essentially the same as with water-based paint, but use mineral spirits instead of water to wash away the paint. Since water-based paint is non-toxic, you can flush the cleaning water down the drain, but what do you do with mineral spirits after you have cleaned the brush? Do not pour them down the drain. This is environmentally unsafe and also wasteful.</p>
        <p>Instead, pour the used spirits into a lidded container and set it aside for a few days so the paint residue can settle to the bottom. The top, clear layer of mineral spirits can be poured off into another container and reused. This settling and decanting procedure can be repeated again and again so you can continue to use the recycled spirits to clean brushes. Let the residue in the original container dry, then dispose of it in an environmentally safe manner.</p>
        <p>Paint rollers are more difficult to clean because the nap holds more paint than a brush. It will be easier to clean the paint roller if you first scrape off excess paint from the nap with a roller cleaner tool (available in paint supply stores and home centers). Then submerge the roller in a bucket of warm water (for water-based paint) and work the nap up and down with your hand to dislodge the paint. Clamp the roller in the spinner tool and spin for about 15 seconds; this should be done in a large bucket or laundry tub. The spinning will throw off excess paint and water and fluff up the nap. Wash the roller in clean water and spin again. Repeat this procedure until the roller is clean then set it on end and allow it to dry. Finally, wrap it loosely in plastic wrap and store it on end.</p>
        <p>Follow the same procedure for cleaning a roller coated with oil-based paint, but use mineral spirits instead of soapy water. Most painters find that they would rather use cheaper rollers for oil-based paints and discard them after use, rather than attempting to clean them with a lot of spirits. This is certainly convenient, but the final paint finish may suffer somewhat.</p>
