        <p>DON'T make a left toward the gymnasium. And don't go straight either, which will take you to the main office. Go right and then look for the Dumpsters. Behind them is a delivery ramp. Up that and to the right is Dave Fernandes's lifeboat-size office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandes is the head custodian at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua. He is in charge of garbage, heat and the scrubbing of floors. Mr. Fernandes is also Horace Greeley's head varsity basketball coach and freshman football coach. And he is the adviser to the junior class.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandes, who has a large, brutish body and a quick, soft smile, grew up in Yonkers. He graduated from high school in 1975 and describes how, though he dreamed of going into coaching, his guidance counselors ''told me I should be a cop or work at General Motors in Tarrytown.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he went to Westchester Community College. But after two semesters, he dropped out and got that job at General Motors. Then he became a mechanic. Finally, in 1985, he took a custodial job at Horace Greeley for one reason: ''benefits.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandes, a father of five, was initially assigned a lot of janitorial work in the gymnasium. After the day's work ended, he began to play basketball with the kids. His natural rapport with them caught the eye of the athletic director, Pete Kuczma. Mr. Kuczma told Mr. Fernandes that if he took the required courses, he would be given a chance to coach. Mr. Fernandes took the courses and in 1988 was named freshman basketball coach.</p>
        <p>Coaching was bliss: ''When I coach, all the bills, all the problems, are not there,'' hesaid. He soon added freshman football to his duties.</p>
        <p>His skill and work ethic soon got the attention of administrators, like Vice Principal Larry Breen. In 1990, he was named class adviser to the freshman class. In this capacity, he planned events and fund-raisers for the entire grade. Then, in 1994, Coach Fernandes achieved his dream. He took over as varsity basketball coach. Two years ago, he was voted the Westchester County Basketball Coaches Association Conference II Coach of the Year.</p>
        <p>Juggling his many roles does not make for leisurely days. Monday through Friday, he drives from his home in Wappingers Falls and arrives at work at 6 a.m. First thing the head custodian must do is make sure that all the buildings on campus are unlocked and then, he says with a determined face, ''the boilers.'' He must check that the heat is working. Next, it's off to the cafeteria, where he helps the food service people get their day going.</p>
        <p>Then, Class Adviser Fernandes beats the bell to homeroom, where he now serves the class of 2002. When the bell ends homeroom, Head Custodian Fernandes beelines it back to his office where he sets janitorial schedules. He will then spend the next four or five hours at various spots around the school, working on projects and fixing problems. By 2:30, a custodian who started his shift at 6 a.m. would normally be on his way home, but that's when Coach Fernandes's day is just beginning.</p>
        <p>During basketball season, he'll spend an hour or so scripting practice or preparing for a game. If it's a practice day, then it's to the gym from 4:30 to 6:30, but he doesn't call it a day there.</p>
        <p>As Nick Fall, a basketball player, points out, ''Coach is always available for extra drills, and if you ever have problems in class he is always taking time to talk to you.'' He tells of how a player on the team was having trouble getting into college. After practice, Coach Fernandes spent untold time soothing his fears. He then started a letter-writing campaign that got the student into college.</p>
        <p>Though you might expect a burly custodian to be a tough coach who yells a lot, Nick makes it clear that though his coach is a strong man, he hardly yells. He doesn't have to.</p>
        <p>''He's got a lot to handle,'' Nick said. ''And since he's been through a more difficult process to be a coach and work his way up to varsity, kids have more respect.'' In terms of game strategy, Nick defines his coach as, above all ''someone who is willing to try a lot of stuff.''</p>
        <p>The coach who cleans concurs. He speaks of how he sometimes puts the last player on the bench, the one no one expects, into the game at a critical moment. ''I always like to surprise them,'' says the man who came to Horace Greeley to get benefits, but has given so many in return.</p>
