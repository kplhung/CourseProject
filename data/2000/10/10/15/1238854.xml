        <p>AFTER a slow start, Japanese restaurants have become almost as ubiquitous as their Chinese counterparts on Long Island. Separating the contenders from the pretenders is a difficult task because most of these spots look alike. The two-month-old Nisen, in a small strip shopping center at 1969 Jericho Turnpike in East Northport (631-462-1000), is just such a place. Its light wood, Asian lanterns, pagoda-roofed sushi bar, rice-paper partitions, Japanese dolls and sumo wrestler hanging room divider give it a cookie-cutter stamp as a  kimono and carry-out storefront. At first glance, its menu too looks like a carbon copy of many others.</p>
        <p>A second glance reveals more. Nisen's chef and owner is Tom Hiyashi, who developed a following first at Suibi in Manhattan and then at Oyama in Great Neck. There is not one, but two menus here. The second one lists an impressive array of special rolls, both cooked and raw. The basic menu too yields some exotica, for sandwiched in between the predictable tempura, teriyaki, sushi, sashimi and sukiyaki selections are some dishes not found on every Japanese menu: garlic butter shrimp, cooked black seaweed, twin lobster tail teriyaki, garlic broccoli and broiled eel with eel sauce.</p>

        <p>AFTER a slow start, Japanese restaurants have become almost as ubiquitous as their Chinese counterparts on Long Island. Separating the contenders from the pretenders is a difficult task because most of these spots look alike. The two-month-old Nisen, in a small strip shopping center at 1969 Jericho Turnpike in East Northport (631-462-1000), is just such a place. Its light wood, Asian lanterns, pagoda-roofed sushi bar, rice-paper partitions, Japanese dolls and sumo wrestler hanging room divider give it a cookie-cutter stamp as a  kimono and carry-out storefront. At first glance, its menu too looks like a carbon copy of many others.</p>
        <p>A second glance reveals more. Nisen's chef and owner is Tom Hiyashi, who developed a following first at Suibi in Manhattan and then at Oyama in Great Neck. There is not one, but two menus here. The second one lists an impressive array of special rolls, both cooked and raw. The basic menu too yields some exotica, for sandwiched in between the predictable tempura, teriyaki, sushi, sashimi and sukiyaki selections are some dishes not found on every Japanese menu: garlic butter shrimp, cooked black seaweed, twin lobster tail teriyaki, garlic broccoli and broiled eel with eel sauce.</p>
        <p>There are also little touches that make it pleasant to dineat this shiny, serene 30-seat eating place. Shortly after being seated, diners receive hot towels from one of the two efficient kimono-clad waitresses; then a complimentary bowl of shredded cucumber, carrot and crab meat in a light mayonnaise dressing appears.</p>
        <p>Certainly no one can accuse Nisen (it means 2000) of being pricey. I have paid more for Japanese food that didn't taste nearly this good. The tab for a recent meal for fourwas $68.20 -- for five pieces of sushi, two special rolls, seaweed salad, five garlic shrimp, eight shumai, sukiyaki, nabe yaki udon (a noodle-based entree) and chicken tatsuta age as well as soup or salad with every entree.</p>
        <p>That seaweed salad, sprinkled with tiny sesame seeds, gave new meaning to the word refreshing. The shrimp, sauteed in a mellow garlic-flecked butter sauce, would hold its own in any Italian restaurant. The sushi, striped bass, fluke, salmon, tuna and yellow mackerel tail at prices that ranged from $1.75 to $2 got tongues tingling and eyes popping. (The latter because the sushi chefs are food artists and the accompanying wasabi has a kick).</p>
        <p>Think chicken nuggets when it comes to the tatsuta age ($4.50), or deep-fried marinated chicken. The fluffy-light shumai ($4.50), or steamed shrimp dumplings, are a notch above ordinary, while both the beef sukiyaki ($13.95) and nabe yaki udon ($9.95) needed squirts of soy sauce to give them some taste punch.  The pretty-as-a-picture sukiyaki, served in an iron pot, packed with carrots, tofu slabs, onions and noodles in a sweet broth, was bogged down by overcooked gray meat, while the nabe yaki udon, or shrimp, chicken and hefty noodles that come in an earthenware casserole, suffered from an overall blandness.</p>
        <p>Before going any further, it should be said that the headliners at Nisen are the terrific special rolls. We sampled four and one was better than  another. Best of all was the Huntington roll ($8.95), a long, salmon-filled, tuna-topped cylinder sprinkled with fried tempura batter and cut into 8 or 10 bite-size pieces. A cooked Tokyo roll ($4.95) of chopped shrimp, crab meat and mayonnaise with a pink coating of fried fish roe also halted all table chit chat, as did a memorable rainbow colored black tuna roll ($4.95) that contained avocado, seared sushi-like tuna and was coated with pepper. Also worth ordering are the Northport roll ($5.50), a satisfying salmon, cucumber, mayonnaise, fried fish roe amalgam, similar to the Huntington roll; and the cucumber roll, six crunchy pieces for only $3 from the regular menu.</p>
        <p>Tempura comes in many contexts at Nisen, as a stand-alone entree, atop soba (or soybean) noodles, in a cooked roll and so on. No matter what its form, try anything enveloped in this lighter-than-air coating.  Other recommended choices are the crisp deep-fried, soft-shell crab appetizer ($6.95); the mushroom yaki ($4.50), or sauteed mushrooms swimming in a savory garlic sauce; and the chicken katsu don ($8.95), a breaded chicken, vegetable, poached egg affair over moist onion-laced brown rice. A sound though more conservative choice is a heaping portion of smooth, skinless, sesame-sprinkled chicken teriyaki ($12.95).</p>
        <p>Also unexciting (and unnecessary) are desserts. The less-than-impressive bunch includes three fried possibilities: ice cream, banana and cheesecake (the last was still icy cold at its core). But even without dessert, eating at Nisen is a sweet experience.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Next month Nel Blu (in the blue), a new 48-seat continental restaurant, will replace Coach Corner at 98 Jackson Avenue in Syosset (516-364-2154).  The Italian eating place, with some French overtones, is owned by Francisco Dilulla, a veteran chef who owned all or part of restaurants like Marangola, Il Villagio and La Pace in Nassau County and saw service at Balduccis in Manhattan and aboard Swedish-American Line ships. Mr. Dilulla's son, Nico, a recent Hofstra graduate, will supervise the dining room. When the redecorated restaurant reopens, it will have a new color scheme, French windows and a small menu offering entrees in the $15 to low $20 range.</p>
        <p>The Dodge City Steakhouse, 62 Montauk Highway in Westhampton (631-288-0500), where Tierra Mar had been, opened a few months ago. The inexpensive (skirt steak $16, London broil $18, steak sandwich $14, fish and chips $15) 130-seat, year-round spot owned by Todd Jacobs, the chef and owner of the new Tierra Mar in Westhampton Beach, is open Thursdays through Sundays and will soon add Mondays.</p>
        <p>Closings</p>
        <p>Old Glory, an American tavern on Jericho Turnpike in Floral Park.</p>
        <p>Uncle Dai, a Chinese Barbecue restaurant on Jericho Turnpike in Woodbury.</p>
        <p>Potpourri</p>
        <p>Kleinfelder's Forest Inn, at 157 Forest Avenue, Massapequa (516-798-4383), is in the midst of Oktoberfest.  There is live German accordion music every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, special German menu items like maultaschen, kaiser delite, roulardon, German chocolate cake and Oktoberfest beer on tap.</p>
