        <p>For Michael H. Jordan, the former chief executive of Westinghouse, the biggest change in moving from the old economy to the new as chairman of Luminant Worldwide, a provider of e-commerce services based in Dallas, was in transportation. ''Life in the private sector -- i.e., without your Gulfstream -- really lacks,'' he joked last week.</p>
        <p>But then, life at Internet speed is also much less predictable. Luminant stock, having peaked at $52 in November, has recently been trading at about $2. Mr. Jordan, in a speech on Thursday at the New York Infotech Forum, remained upbeat. ''If you don't fail at something, you never tried hard enough to do something different,'' he said, alluding to the experience of new-economy companies. ''I believe that the business revolution is not over, but the profile of their success will be somewhat different.''</p>

        <p>But then, life at Internet speed is also much less predictable. Luminant stock, having peaked at $52 in November, has recently been trading at about $2.

''I believe that the business revolution is not over, but the profile of their success will be somewhat different.''</p>
        <p>He predicted that the decline in Web businesses would turn around in the next 12 months as large corporations realized that the Internet was not ''some great mysterious thing that you have to wear a ponytail to understand.'' The new economy will then permeate the old economy rather than standing apart, he said.</p>
        <p>What about the downturn's effects on his own wealth? ''The expression in Texas is, down here trees don't grow to the sky,'' Mr. Johnson said, noting that many other stocks are also way down. ''It's either feast or famine; we're in love or we're going to run for the exits. I'm still chairman, and I still have a lot of stock.''</p>
