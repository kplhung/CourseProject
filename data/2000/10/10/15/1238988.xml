        <p>LONG ago, the Chubb Corporation figured out that wealthy people would pay a little more to insure their mansions and yachts if, when it came time to collect on a claim, they were treated royally.</p>
        <p>So instead of following the usual practice of paying as little as possible on claims, Chubb habitually erred on the side of the customer. It did not quibble over costs for the finest workmanship when paying repair claims. Often, it paid borderline claims that it might legally have rejected.</p>
        <p>Neighbors talked to neighbors, and Chubb, which is based in Warren, N.J., came to dominate coverage in this rarefied world where a family might own three or four multimillion-dollar homes, a stable of expensive cars, a yacht and maybe a helicopter or small jet, and pay annual premiums of $50,000 or more to insure it all.</p>
        <p>The niche has proved so lucrative that it has attracted an aggressive new entrant, the American International Group, which is best known for providing high-level commercial coverage worldwide. The company, based in New York, has taken particular aim at customers with holdings of more than $5 million and has hired away more than a dozen Chubb executives. It seems bent on out-Chubbing Chubb.</p>
        <p>However, analysts say that won't be easy. ''I think A.I.G. has got a shot,'' said Weston Hicks of J. P. Morgan, ''but Chubb has set the bar very high.'' Several companies have challenged Chubb, he said, and failed.</p>
        <p>While Chubb previously offered a maximum of $10 million in liability coverage, for example, A.I.G. has upped the ante to $100 million. And while Chubb sometimes shied away from covering more exotic car models or all of a wealthy client's homes, especially those in hurricane or earthquake zones, A.I.G. plunges in. It wants all of a customer's business -- for homes, yachts, Lamborghinis, fine art and aircraft, and even coverage against kidnapping.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to provide comprehensive insurance for wealthy families,'' said Ross J. Buchmueller, who left Chubb to start A.I.G.'s private-client group in July.</p>
        <p>Chubb has responded with a number of service upgrades. It will now write liability coverage up to $50 million. And though, like most insurers, it may not want to add clients in parts of Florida and California, it is gritting its teeth and doing so rather than watch those customers take their business to A.I.G. Chubb has also begun offering aircraft and kidnapping insurance linked to homeowners' policies.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to let the camel's head under our tent,'' said Richard Ort, who is in charge of Chubb's coverage on homes and other personal belongings.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Ort said Chubb modified its coverage not because of new competition, but because of the growing number of personal megafortunes made during the economic boom. ''All of a sudden, lots of people have homes in the Caribbean,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some brokers say Chubb was becoming a bit arrogant, rejecting some kinds of coverage on homes and cars and insisting on preventive measures that customers occasionally saw as unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Now Chubb appears to be softening up. ''Chubb seems much more responsive to our needs since A.I.G. has announced its plans,'' said Jim Brooks, the vice president in charge of marketing at the Amaden Gay Agencies, an insurance broker in the wealthy Hamptons area of Long Island.</p>
        <p>CHUBB has managed to profit on its high-end coverage; the company, which is also doing well with its commercial business, is expected to earn $1.02 a share in the third quarter, versus 43 cents in the period a year earlier. It charges roughly 15 percent more than most other insurers for the same dollar amounts of home insurance -- and the difference may be even bigger on less expensive properties. It has comparatively few claims because the wealthy often take special precautions to protect belongings. Chubb also appraises property to ensure appropriate coverage.</p>
        <p>But more important, Mr. Ort said, ''when you're insuring a $5 million or $10 million property, a whole lot more money comes in the front door than if you're insuring a half-a-million-dollar property.''</p>
        <p>A.I.G. plans to capitalize on that idea, too. While Chubb insures $400,000 homes as the low end of its market, A.I.G. has aimed to start its coverage at $1 million. One incentive for A.I.G. to offer very wide coverage is that profits on insuring art collections, jewelry and liability run considerably higher than for coverage on homes alone.</p>
        <p>So far, A.I.G. has received regulatory approval to sell coverage on homes in 17 states, including New York, but not New Jersey or Connecticut. It expects to be licensed in all states by early next year.</p>
        <p>One of its first challenges is to persuade independent brokers -- the go-betweens with homeowners -- to take on a new company. Some brokers say they like the idea of having an alternative insurer in cases where -- for whatever reason -- Chubb may not want to provide coverage. But others say they are content with their relationship with Chubb and are not seeking a new one. And some say they are not sure how A.I.G., as a newcomer, will perform in this niche.</p>
        <p>''I sleep well when I know my customers are going to be treated right,'' said Philip B. Weymouth Jr., the principal owner of Weymouth &amp; Smith Insurance, in Wilmington, Del., which has been selling Chubb coverage for many years.</p>
        <p>But to reach its target market of cream-of-the-crop clients, Mr. Buchmueller said, A.I.G. needs to sign up only about 250 of the thousands of independent agents.</p>
        <p>Many brokers can provide examples of how Chubb has gone the extra mile on claims. One told of a Mercedes-Benz that was insured for $13,000; when it was totaled in an accident, Chubb adjustors calculated its value at $25,000 and paid the higher amount. Another broker recalled a client whose grounds were damaged after a heating oil tank was punctured. The insurance applied only to the house, but Chubb still paid $20,000 for the cleanup.</p>
        <p>In Coral Gables, Fla., driving rains last year caused $75,000 in damage to a large condominium owned by Clayre and Jay Haft. ''I just submitted the bills and they paid,'' said Mrs. Haft, a former stockbroker. ''They were as cooperative as anyone could possibly hope.''</p>
        <p>But A.I.G. has a reputation in the industry  as being tough on claims. ''They're very good at defending liability suits,'' Mr. Weymouth said, meaning that the company fights hard to pay as little as possible in lawsuits against its customers.</p>
        <p>A.I.G. contends that it pays precisely what it should on its claims. Robert M. Sandler, the senior claims executive who also oversees its homeowners coverage, said the company ''is not tough on claims in the sense that we avoid paying claims we should pay.''</p>
        <p>But brokers said that following the letter of the law would not cut it if A.I.G. wanted to take business away from Chubb.</p>
        <p>''A.I.G. is going to have to take on the same attitude in adjusting claims as exists at Chubb,'' said David Rubin, the owner of the Rubin Group in Manhattan, which provides commercial and personal coverage to clients across the country.</p>
        <p>A.I.G. plans to do just that -- and more. ''Our claims handling,'' Mr. Buchmueller said, ''is going to make us stand out above and beyond anything that's been done to date.''</p>
