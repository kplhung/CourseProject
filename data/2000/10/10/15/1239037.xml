        <p>BONNIE BERNSTEIN has a job most men would kill for. After lunch on a recent Monday, Ms. Bernstein settled down on the black leather sofa in her Upper West Side apartment with a stack of N.F.L. videotapes, a remote control and a bowl of microwave popcorn.</p>
        <p>If it weren't for the tall bottle of Evian in place of a six-pack, her living room could be a Budweiser ad. Barefoot, wearing a Nike fleece pullover and black soccer shorts, Ms. Bernstein began an intense study of the previous day's football games, halting the tape from time to time and filling up several legal pads with notes. As a sideline reporter for N.F.L. broadcasts on CBS, Ms. Bernstein, 27, feels she has to get the extra yard on her male colleagues.</p>
        <p>''Women sports reporters are definitely held to a higher standard,'' she said. Before each game, she studies every conceivable statistic, offensive and defensive formations, and every injury report for the two teams she will be covering on the coming Sunday. Between scouting tapes, she pops in a video of her own on-the-field performance, offering a running critique. ''Sometimes you do things that you're totally unaware of, make weird faces or body gestures,'' she said. Hitting the pause button, she pointed out how her cap-sleeve chartreuse blouse had turned a blinding canary yellow in the glare of the Dolphins stadium in Miami.</p>
        <p>''And see, right there, I was talking too fast,'' she said, grimacing when she heard herself referring to Thurman Thomas, a Miami running back, as sitting on the bench with a ''stroin'' before correcting it to ''strained left groin.'' Her flub elicited chuckles from the booth. Dick Enberg, the veteran announcer, teased, ''I'll add that to my medical glossary, Bonnie -- he's got a 'stroin.' ''</p>
        <p>The National Football League is an increasingly competitive business -- and not just for the growling 300-pound behemoths trying to crack the starting roster in summer training camp. With the explosion of 24-hour cable sports programming, every network covering pro football has been coming up with new ways to battle for viewers. This season, ABC hired the acerbic comedian Dennis Miller to try to add edge to ''Monday Night Football.'' CBS regularly has celebrities like Danny Glover and Tony Danza on its live broadcasts. Fox has ratcheted up its raunchy humor and pro-wrestling-style commentary on its top-rated pregame show, ''Fox N.F.L. Sunday.'' And one key attraction that no network covering pro football can do without is a glamorous -- and brainy -- female reporter to complement the scent of liniment and after-shave in the broadcast booth.</p>
        <p>Female sportscasters are being hired to offset the machismo of motormouth male announcers and linemen-turned-analysts with 20-inch necks stuffed into outsize Zegna suits. But their increased presence in front of the camera also reflects a growing female interest in the sport. ''Statistically, it's true that a lot more women are watching football now,'' said Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports. ''There's been a real effort on the part of all the N.F.L. broadcasters to attract people who might not be hard-core fans, but will tune in to see something a little bit different.''</p>
        <p>Back in the 70's, when Phyllis George, a former Miss America, was the lone woman working the N.F.L. circuit, it was perhaps enough to be a pretty face with only a passing knowledge of the game. Now, a woman needs not only a winning beauty-queen smile to be a sportscaster, but also the skill to break down a nickel defense and explain why the Rams are scoring 40 points a game under Kurt Warner and how in news conferences Keyshawn Johnson of the Buccaneers always seems to manage to plant a cleat squarely in his own mouth.</p>
        <p>The surge of expert women has shaken up the macho culture of the N.F.L. ''It's changed so much that at one of the games I did last year, I walked into the press box and it was like 'all women, all the time,' '' said Jeanne Zelasko, an N.F.L. reporter and national sports anchor for Fox.</p>
        <p>Human interest segments reported by women often spice up the dry X-and-O strategy talk. These sportscasters have proved that women can be fixtures on N.F.L. sidelines without hot pants and pompoms. And they've begun to attract new female viewers by showing that women can be just as obsessive about football as men can be.</p>
        <p>Professional football has not always been receptive to professional women. In 1990, Lisa Olson, who was then a reporter for The Boston Herald and is now a columnist for The Daily News in New York, complained of sexual harassment after being surrounded by several naked and seminaked players in the New England Patriots locker room. The Patriots team, as well as three of its players, were fined by the league. Ms. Olson's experience is frequently cited as a turning point by the women who cover the N.F.L. today.</p>
        <p>On a bright October Sunday, Leslie Visser was preparing to go on the air live from CBS's outdoor set of ''The N.F.L. Today,'' on Fifth Avenue opposite the Plaza Hotel. Taking her place next to Mike Ditka, Ms. Visser, a 17-year veteran of sports broadcasting, smilingly recalled some of the cheap shots she had taken, like the time she approached Chuck Fairbanks, then the Patriots coach, and asked who he was going to start at outside linebacker. ''He looked at me and said: 'Why don't you call my daughter to go to lunch? You're about the same age.' ''</p>
        <p>All the women who work as reporters have differing strategies on how to cope in an industry that celebrates masculine posturing. Melissa Stark, the new sideline reporter for ''Monday Night Football,'' seems to work two angles at once. She can brag about a gridiron background that dates to her infancy: her father was the ophthalmologist for the Baltimore Colts. But she is also glamorous enough to pose for a feature in the current issue of Vogue.</p>
        <p>Ms. Visser, who is cited by many of the younger women as a trailblazer in television sports, said: ''Style issues weigh more heavily on women on TV in general. I remember Diane Sawyer saying she got more mail when she cut her hair than any time in her career.'' Ms. Visser acknowledged that she is not immune to image pressure. ''Personally, I have total hair-anoia,'' she said with a staccato laugh.</p>
        <p>One of Bonnie Bernstein's strategies, when faced with a skeptical N.F.L. interviewee, is to establish a little jock rapport. She still has a lithely muscled physique from her days as an all-American gymnast and soccer player at the University of Maryland, and the battle wounds to prove it. Straightening her leg on her living room sofa, she showed off a curving white scar the length of a kitchen knife, a result of four operations on a knee blown out during a gymnastics meet.</p>
        <p>''The ultimate icebreaker,'' she said. ''If I have to deal with a player for the first time and I'm wearing a skirt or a dress, I just happen to cross my right leg over my left and it's an instant conversation piece. When they see the battle wounds and they realize you've been through the trenches too, the guys respect you right away.''</p>
        <p>One way these women have carved out a niche is by doing human interest segments. While the beat isn't exclusively theirs -- Roone Arledge pioneered the genre in the 1970's with ABC's ''up close and personal'' interviews -- women are appearing more and more on the popular biographical feature, the kind that dominated the coverage of the Sydney Olympics. On any given Sunday, you can catch reporters like Ms. Visser and Pam Oliver, of Fox, doing the heartfelt personal interview, sitting down with a teary-eyed running back whose father has just died or a linebacker whose son was born with a learning disability.</p>
        <p>''One of the more interesting sides of covering sports is showing these athletes as human beings and not as these sort of beautiful gladiators, which is the way they're often portrayed,'' said Sonja Steptoe, a reporter for Sports Illustrated, who contributes features to ''Inside the N.F.L.'' and ''Real Sports'' on HBO.</p>
        <p>''We can walk away with an interesting twist on stories, because guys will open up to us more,'' Ms. Zelasko said. ''A lot of these guys can probably talk to their wives and their mothers and sisters in a different way than they can talk to their male friends or teammates who they're too busy high-fiving.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zelasko recalled approaching Ryan Leaf, the Chargers quarterback, in a locker room when he was in a foul mood, and asking him a particularly tough question. ''I think if I was a guy he might have punched my lights out or said something really nasty,'' she said. Ms. Steptoe said she had also defused similarly tense moments in her interviews. ''I've even gone so far as to say, 'O.K., look, don't hit me, but I've got to ask you this.' ''</p>
        <p>The women say that to be taken seriously as journalists, they must pay special attention to the way they dress. Ms. Bernstein said that as a fan, she would rather turn up for games in sweats and a ball cap, but professional decorum (not to mention her contract with the designer Dana Buchman) requires a more elegant look.</p>
        <p>''You have to be very guarded in your dress,'' Ms. Zelasko said. ''Unfortunately, you do lose some of your femininity. Before I started to work around a lot of guys, I used to wear skirts all the time, but it's really not practical on a football field. Heels are really not practical on AstroTurf.''</p>
        <p>One longstanding but often unspoken assumption, many of these reporters acknowledged, is that any woman working in the sports industry must be a glorified groupie looking to date an athlete. No sideline reporter wants to be mistaken for one of the Dallas Cowboys' cheerleaders, so conservative pantsuits and hairstyles are de rigueur.</p>
        <p>There are exceptions. This season, ''Fox N.F.L. Sunday'' has featured reports on day-of-the-game weather by the curvaceous Jillian Barberie, wearing skintight tops and hot-pink leather pants that often elicit leering comments from Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Cris Collinsworth at the anchor desk.</p>
        <p>Ms. Visser offered a different perspective. ''There are two kinds of women who go into this field,'' she said. ''There are women who love sports, and they end up in TV, and there are women who just want to be on TV, and they end up in sports. You can tell the difference.''</p>
        <p>One of the biggest controversies in the past year, eliciting charges of ageism, occurred when ''Monday Night Football,'' the N.F.L.'s marquee prime-time program, replaced Ms. Visser, then 46, with Ms. Stark, who is 20 years younger.</p>
        <p>''In most jobs, the more experience you have, the more value you have,'' Ms. Visser said as she prepared to introduce her segment on St. Louis's record-setting offense for ''The N.F.L. Today.'' ''But I feel in the end it was a little bit like the Marshall Faulk trade, which worked out well for Indianapolis and worked out great for the St. Louis Rams.''</p>
        <p>She added that women who report on the N.F.L., more than their male counterparts, need to develop a thick skin. ''I always try to tell women that, no matter how hard you work, there's going to be a moment of humiliation,'' Ms. Visser said. ''So you better build up that scar tissue.''</p>
