        <p>IS the stock market done going down, down, down?</p>
        <p>Without a copy of next week's newspaper, it's a tough call to make. But because stocks have dropped sharply in the autumn over the last three years, only to rebound impressively, investors most likely suspect -- and almost certainly hope -- that the market's troubles are closer to their end than to their start.</p>
        <p>Shares rallied on Friday, but all the major indexes closed down for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 13 percent since it peaked in January, while the Nasdaq composite has plummeted 34 percent from its March heights.</p>
        <p>Investors in technology and telecommunications stocks have been the hardest hit. And as they survey the wreckage in these stocks, they may now think that they see bargains popping up.</p>
        <p>There is a problem, though, with investing in stocks that have risen not on fundamentals but rather on headlong purchases by momentum traders. When these stocks fall, the throngs that bought them simply because they were going up have no idea what they are worth. With some stocks way down -- many have lost more than 60 percent of their value -- investors may think they have bottomed out when they haven't.</p>
        <p>Consider Intel, a company revered by investors. Since last month's warning that third-quarter sales would miss analysts' estimates, traders have sliced 34 percent off Intel's value. But is it a buy?</p>
        <p>No, says Fred Hickey, editor of the High Tech Strategist Newsletter in Nashua, N.H., who has been dead right in his predictions of how the recent technology wreck would unfold. While Mr. Hickey acknowledges that some technology stocks are worth a look, Intel, he argues, is still too high.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hickey points out that for years, as Intel had a virtual monopoly producing a highly specialized product, its shares traded in a range of 10 to 15 times earnings. Today, at $40.38, it is trading at 30 times earnings.</p>
        <p>''Now they have real competition from the Taiwanese and A.M.D.,'' Mr. Hickey said, referring to Advanced Micro Devices. He also believes that investors can no longer count on the gains that Intel has enjoyed in its own portfolio of investments. ''Maybe it's fairly valued somewhere in the teens,'' he said. ''At $18, it would still be trading at four times sales, a lot for a semiconductor company selling commodity-type stuff.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Hickey thinks most of what looks cheap today may become even cheaper, stocks he says to consider include Lucent Technologies, Motorola and Lexmark International. ''If you see new management at Lucent, there could be a turnaround there,'' he said. And Motorola, trading at a price equal to its sales, is attractive, too. Apple Computer has $10 a share in cash on its balance sheet, he added, giving the stock something of a floor.</p>
        <p>James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, is another strategist who fears that the liquidation of technology stocks is not yet over. That is because the sales growth that technology companies enjoyed in the last few years is slowing.</p>
        <p>The technology boom that propelled these stocks, Mr. Paulsen said, was fueled by falling computer and cell phone prices. Now the price declines are reversing, and consumers are slowing purchases. ''Real personal consumption growth in technology went from an 80 percent rate in 1999 to 35 percent right now,'' he said. ''When there's not real price declines, it slows the growth.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, technology is such a big contributor to economic growth in the United States that a slowdown in the sector could have much broader effects today than it would have had even five years ago. ''Because it's such a huge piece of the economy,'' Mr. Paulsen said, ''if tech is going down for a breather, the economy's going down for a breather.''</p>
