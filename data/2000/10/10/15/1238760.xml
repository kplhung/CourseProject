        <p>A WHALE HUNT</p>
        <p>By Robert Sullivan.</p>
        <p>285 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Scribner. $25.</p>
        <p>Robert Sullivan's first book, ''The Meadowlands,'' was a Whitmanesque celebration of that much-maligned marsh in New Jersey, providing a quirky, often hilarious tour of a wasteland riddled with man-made curiosities and unexpected eruptions of natural beauty. Without ever sounding cynical or mannered, Sullivan evoked a good old-fashioned sense of transcendental awe amid the ruins of modern life. What to do with a diminished thing? Get yourself a canoe and explore it.</p>
        <p>Sullivan's marvelous new book, ''A Whale Hunt,'' finds him once again in a canoe but a canoe of an entirely different order. A couple of years ago he headed out to a remote corner of the Pacific Northwest to follow a crew of Native American whalers as they attempted to re-establish their tribal tradition of hunting the gray whale. Before the Makah could perform the activity that had once defined them as a people, they had to overcome protests from animal rights activists, intense news media scrutiny, internal squabbling and their own lack of whaling knowledge. (It had been more than a generation since the tribe ceased whaling.) Not until two years after Sullivan first arrived on the Olympic Peninsula did the Makah finally kill a whale.</p>
        <p>While Sullivan waited for events to unfold, dividing much of his time between a crude wooden shanty and a tent, he read and reread ''Moby-Dick.'' His mounting enthusiasm for Melville's masterpiece determines, in large part, the structure and tone of ''A Whale Hunt.'' As events came to a head, Sullivan had the impression that Melville's leviathan of a book had, in some strange and crucial way, become a part of what he was witnessing. ''As impossible as it might seem,'' he writes, ''I sometimes felt as if I was seeing the art of 'Moby-Dick' in life.''</p>
        <p>Sullivan's vigil took place in Neah Bay, Wash., a community of 1,500 people, most of them members of the Makah tribe. It is a desperately poor town between the mountains and the sea, inaccessible by road until 1931. In Neah Bay, Sullivan tells us, ''it is considered a sign of affection to swerve your car toward someone else's as it comes toward you in the road. This is possible mostly because there are usually only three or four cars on the main road at any given time.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to the poverty and cultural rootlessness of contemporary Neah Bay is the evidence of what the Makah once were -- a proud and prosperous people wholly dedicated to whaling. Several decades before, at a place known as Ozette, archaeologists uncovered a kind of Native American Pompeii: an almost perfectly preserved Makah house that had been buried beneath a mudslide more than 500 years ago. The centerpiece of this large, highly sophisticated cedar-plank dwelling -which included containers of whale oil, harpoons and conical rain hats made of woven spruce roots -- was a piece of artwork: ''the giant, carved-from-wood dorsal fin of a whale, decorated with some 700 otter teeth, the prize in the house of a whaler.''</p>
        <p>Whaling was not just a source of material prosperity for the Makah; it was also a spiritual endeavor. To prepare themselves for the hunt, whalers performed a variety of sacred rituals that sometimes included swimming naked in the frigid water with a human corpse strapped to the whaler's back. The hunt itself demanded great skill and courage. To prevent the whale from sinking after it had been killed, one of the whalers would leap out of the canoe and sew the mouth of the 30-ton creature shut before it vanished beneath the waves.</p>
        <p>As Sullivan makes clear, the modern-day Makah's decision to hunt a whale was motivated by a genuine desire to reclaim this lost cultural heritage, even if they planned to use a giant gun to kill the whale after it had been harpooned. The ever-increasing number of animal rights activists arriving in Neah Bay -- who tended to be much better organized than the Makah -- asserted that the Indians' real motive was to sell the whale meat to Japan and other whale-eating nations. For the protesters this was, in the words of one, ''a fight of good versus evil.''</p>
        <p>Reading ''A Whale Hunt,'' one can't help seeing the protesters as the media-savvy Ahabs and the Makah as the Starbucks, an embattled, often conflicted people trying to save their culture in the only way they know how. That a whale must die is certainly a terrible thing, but, as Sullivan points out, the gray whale population has rebounded remarkably in recent years. Once again following Melville's lead, Sullivan finds a metaphor in the color of the Makah's prey: ''In some people's minds, my own included, the effect that the hunt would have on the gray whale population, not to mention whale-human relations . . . wasn't clear. It was gray.''</p>
        <p>Sullivan has a very Ishmael-like talent for being both funny and generous, and at times ''A Whale Hunt'' reads like ''Cool Runnings'' meets ''Northern Exposure.'' Standing at the center of the controversy was the unassuming captain of the Makah whaling crew, Wayne Johnson, whom Sullivan calls ''the appointed conscience of the event.'' Johnson, who attended court-mandated anger-management classes throughout much of Sullivan's time in Neah Bay (like Billy Budd, he slugged a guy), was put in charge of training the crew almost by default. ''Sometimes,'' Sullivan writes, ''it seemed to me he ended up as captain because it was a post akin to vice president in that it was assumed he would never actually be in charge.'' Throughout the two-year ordeal, during which he weathered criticism from both his own people and the outside world, Johnson showed a remarkable ability to rise to the occasion. Once, he became the focus of some of the more vitriolic protesters. ''You're evil!'' a protester screamed repeatedly as Johnson stared quietly at his feet. ''Then, all of a sudden,'' Sullivan writes, ''he held his chin up, his chin wobbling a little as he did, looking as if it might fall back, lose its nerve. 'Save the beef,' Wayne finally said. 'Go stand in front of McDonald's.' ''</p>
        <p>Then there was the time that members of the World Council of Whalers, a group dedicated to reviving global whaling, slunk into town to offer their support. ''To look at the faces on the visiting whalers as they stood around on the main street in Neah Bay,'' Sullivan writes, ''was to see a mini-history of humanity's nearly expired hunt for the whale.'' As the group carpooled out to see a demonstration of the Makah's whaling gun, the tone of the conversation was, in Sullivan's words, ''anti-antiwhaling.'' A representative from New Zealand told how environmentalists from his country had been known to play music into the blowholes of beached whales in an attempt to assuage their pain. ''Everyone within earshot of this story,'' Sullivan recounts, ''shook his head and laughed.'' A whaler from the Faroe Islands questioned why the Makah felt compelled to hunt the whale in a canoe. ''Have you gone Hollywood?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>AT one point, Sullivan set out on a road trip, driving south along the coast to Baja California in search of the winter quarters of the gray whale. Along the way he stopped to talk to several antiwhaling activists and artists, an occasion that gives him the opportunity to supply an insightful account of how the whale became the poster child for our politically correct age. Eventually he arrived at Scammon's Lagoon, the gray whale breeding ground where Charles Scammon almost single-handedly wiped out the entire species in the 1850's. While there, Sullivan found a biographical sketch of Scammon that asserted: ''He was a man who lived in his own age, held 19th-century ideas and acted according to 19th-century morality. No one can do more. Many have accomplished less.'' Sullivan tells us: ''I read this section over and over. Sometimes I found it a little uplifting. Sometimes it made me sad and a little depressed.'' This is the conundrum that the example of native whaling places before us: When does an aboriginal group, or any group for that matter, lose its right to live as it once did? Is it really possible to retrieve a past age?</p>
        <p>Instead of the great clashing of cosmic forces that characterizes the ending of ''Moby-Dick,'' the climax of ''A Whale Hunt'' is, as it should be, a more muted and real reflection of our contemporary situation. Sullivan neatly describes the moment as ''a coincidence of phenomena: underwater instinctual mammalian migration and a man-based need to define itself -- the latter, in this instance, against the ocean-backdropped hum of modern existence.'' Once you get beyond the uproar and the politics, Sullivan seems to be saying, we are all just people, trying to find meaning in a most confusing and changeable world.</p>
