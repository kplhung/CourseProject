        <p>SCANNING the wreckage of Latin American technology stocks, it is hard to believe that just six months ago investors in both North and South America were giddy about prospects that the Internet would grow faster in the region than anywhere else in the world.</p>
        <p>Today, the pioneering Latin American Internet stocks lie battered and bruised. Planned initial public offerings have been scrapped. Venture capital money has dried up. Companies that were in hiring frenzies just months ago have let employees go. Some start-ups have shut down. Vultures are circling over others.</p>
        <p>''The information technology sector is out of favor right now globally, but much more so in Latin America,'' Eduardo Cabrera, senior director of Latin America strategy for Merrill Lynch, said recently at the Council of the Americas annual economic forecast in New York. ''It's hard to see some of these Internet companies ever coming back.''</p>
        <p>The bright outlook darkened last spring with the meltdown of the Nasdaq, where the biggest Latin American Internet companies are traded.  For several reasons, the effect was magnified in Latin America. Internet companies there generally are smaller and less established than those here. The market is more segmented by country and culture, making widespread success harder than in the more homogeneous United States. Also, the Latin American market was literally being defined when the bottom fell out in April.</p>
        <p>Finally, ''As usually happens in Latin America, things happened with greater exuberance than in the United States,'' said David Yanovich, executive editor of Punto-com, a new information services company that tracks the Latin American Internet market. ''For a while, everyone was falling in love with Latin American Internet,'' Mr. Yanovich said. ''Now they hate it.''</p>
        <p>It is easy to see why. Shares in StarMedia, the biggest Latin American portal and the company whose successful $110 million stock offering  in June 1999 spawned dozens of would-be followers, closed Friday on the Nasdaq exchange at $5.69, less than one-tenth of the high they reached a few weeks after listing. In September, StarMedia let go of 125 employees, about 15 percent of its work force.</p>
        <p>StarMedia has said the layoffs were needed to consolidate recent acquisitions and will help it climb into the black by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say the Nasdaq links of the big Latin American Internet companies yoked them to the Nasdaq fall, but that in the end the listing will help them restore confidence and rebound, if they can become profitable.</p>
        <p>Until then, the going will be rough. El Sitio, for example, another big portal, is now trading on Nasdaq at $3.44, less than 10 percent of its high of $41 at the end of last year.</p>
        <p>Quepasa, listed on Nasdaq just over a year ago for about $17, closed Friday at 67 cents. Terra Networks, part of the Spanish Telefonica congolomerate, has declined about 40 percent since late last year, closing Friday at $22.06.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabrera does not have buy recommendations on StarMedia and Terra, despite the low prices, but he advises shareowners to hold the stocks because the companies have solid plans and ''the big will survive.'' He is not sure about the smaller companies, like El Sitio and Quepasa, which will not have access to more capital any time soon.</p>
        <p>Richard C. Madigan, director of Latin American investments for Offitbank, said the explosive growth in Latin American Internet companies over the last year was speculative and ultimately unsustainable. ''A lot of venture capital went into start-ups, but most of the money went into marketing and branding,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Brian Kim, a director of CVC Latin America, one of Citicorp's venture capital arms, detects a ''dramatic shift'' in investors' views of existing companies, especially the start-ups that have not yet gone public.</p>
        <p>''Five years from now, you'll have a handful of companies that will have a real opportunity to be catalysts in their sectors,'' he said. ''Then there will be another tier of companies that will find a segment of the market and become niche players. But the vast majority of the companies that you see there today, quite frankly, are going to disappear.''</p>
