        <p>Joe Brown looks over the dumbbells laid out on a table in front of a small, weathered truck. He chooses a pair of five-pounders, plunks down $10 bill and gathers his change. Then he walks away, careful to miss the muddy lake that covers about half the vacant lot at the center of the Admiral Wilson Boulevard where the truck sits.</p>
        <p>''Cheaper than Sports Authority,'' says Mr. Brown of Camden, with a grin.</p>
        <p>The boulevard is coming back, sort of.</p>
        <p>Nearly three months after the Republicans gathered across the river in Philadelphia for their quadrennial convention, there is a long way to go before the boulevard becomes the viable commercial byway that Governor Whitman said was intended when she pressed officials from the Delaware River Port Authority, the state and Camden County to start the $50 million Camden Gateway Project.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority was given the green light to purchase or condemn 44 properties on the south side of the boulevard along the Cooper River. It condemned and tore down nearly every building and billboard along that side in the months before the Republicans arrived in the summer.</p>
        <p>Then once the Republicans left -- some through this back door -- the Port Authority stopped for a breather, Joseph Diemer, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said in an interview last week.</p>
        <p>Now, as the first frost edges closer, the authority is planting 200 trees where strip joints and no-tell motels used to be. It is putting in recycled asphalt as a base for a new parking lot near Baird Boulevard, and a  10-foot-wide jogging and bike path along the Cooper River on the south side of the highway is expected to be completed next year.</p>
        <p>Across the highway, the north side of the Admiral Wilson Boulevard is still an eyesore. The 400-yard stretch of a vacant lot where Mr. Brown bought his dumbbells from the back of the truck is one of three scarred stretches that runs about two miles  from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to the Pennsauken border. There are two ramshackle discount liquor stores and a half boarded-up Chinese take-out stand. A damaged billboard touting Olga's Diner -- which moved deeper into the suburbs more than 20 years ago -- and four other large billboards loom. Barbed wire tops chain-link fences along several other properties. Prostitutes who used to ply both sides of the boulevard now eschew the park-to-be on the south and stick to the northern sidewalks.</p>
        <p>The Champs-Elysees, this is not.</p>
        <p>Before World War II, the Admiral Wilson Boulevard was a major entertainment strip. The first drive-in movie in the world was built there during the Depression, and roadhouse restaurants predominated for the next generation. Into the 1970's, the Admiral Wilson Boulevard had many viable businesses: It had long been the car-dealership strip of the South Jersey suburbs; there were several diners, motels and liquor stores; and the engineering offices for Public Service Electric and Gas were there.</p>
        <p>At the Pennsauken end of the boulevard stands one of the last business, Zinman Furs. Larry Wenger, vice president of Zinman, which has been on the highway for more than 50 years, is crossing his fingers that redevelopment is on its way.</p>
        <p>''Hey, it took a long time for this to run down,'' said Mr. Wenger. ''You've got to give it some time to get back. Look at the filth they got rid of on the other side. It can be done.''</p>
        <p>To that end, the Port Authority has contracted with Environmental Resolutions of Mount Laurel to come up with a plan for zoning, utilities and highway access for the north side of the boulevard. Mr. Diemer foresees no condemnation proceedings, but instead says the Port Authority wants to work with property owners to revive the commercial heritage of the boulevard.</p>
        <p>''It's the gateway to Philadelphia, and there is no reason why it can't be a good business district,'' said Mr. Diemer.</p>
        <p>For now, there is little beauty or business activity on the Admiral Wilson Boulevard. Several old gas stations were among buildings torn down on the south side of the boulevard in the summer, and no one is  bidding on any of the north side properties.</p>
        <p>Camden's tax assessor's office said the city stood to lose as much as $3 million in taxes annually from the razing of the properties on the south side of the boulevard.</p>
        <p>The state Department of Transportation has spent $15 million to upgrade the roadway, put cobblestones next to the sidewalks on either side and faux brick on the medial road barrier. But few people, except for the  prostitutes who troll the boulevard, seem to be noticing the new cobblestones that catch their pointed heels, and there hardly seems to be a clamor from them for a bike path along the busy six-lane highway that traverses one of the more crime-ridden cities in the state.</p>
        <p>Still, there is hope that someone finally cares about commercial Camden.</p>
        <p>''I think they don't want to waste the money they already spent,'' said Mr. Wenger. ''Yes, it s a monumental task, but this is the main highway into Center City Philadelphia. It has got to be ripe for development. It's plodding, but you have got to have hope.''</p>
