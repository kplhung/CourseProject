        <p>Four weeks ago, when the Jets and New England were preparing to play for the first time this season, more than a dozen reporters practically climbed over one another to get closer to the speakerphone through which Patriots Coach Bill Belichick was talking about his relationship with Al Groh and his fissure with Bill Parcells.</p>

        <p>Four weeks ago, when the Jets and New England were preparing to play for the first time this season, more than a dozen reporters practically climbed over one another to get closer to the speakerphone through which Patriots Coach Bill Belichick was talking about his relationship with Al Groh and his fissure with Bill Parcells.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, however, Belichick could have held a quiet heart-to-heart considering the few reporters who bothered to talk to him.</p>
        <p>Those not present were crammed around a vacant cubbyhole in the Jets' locker room, hoping for an appearance by quarterback Vinny Testaverde, whose aching neck and tingling hand overshadowed this electric rivalry, at least for a week.</p>
        <p>How appropriate, though, that it was Belichick's defense that nearly changed the course of the Jets' season with a fourth-quarter hit on Testaverde in the teams' first meeting, which the Jets won, 20-19, on Sept. 11 at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Belichick's defense will most likely shape today's rematch at New England, too, and not only because Testaverde is vulnerable.</p>
        <p>The Patriots' defensive front seven has helped propel New England from the doldrums of an 0-4 record to a 2-4 mark after shocking victories over the Denver Broncos and the Indianapolis Colts. The Patriots won largely because they held both teams to fewer than 100 yards rushing -- and the Colts' Edgerrin James to 75 yards.</p>
        <p>The Jets' Curtis Martin, who was battling a knee injury, had 47 yards against the Patriots in September, 38.8 yards below his season average. The Patriots are allowing 3.5 yards a rush. The Jets are getting 3.6 yards a rush. Martin's average is 3.8.</p>
        <p>While the Patriots' defense struggled in its early games -- allowing touchdowns in their opponents' first five trips inside the red zone -- they have allowed only one touchdown in six trips inside the red zone in their last two games.</p>
        <p>Jets center Kevin Mawae said that the key to this improved defense is that the defensive front is geared to keeping opponents away from the linebackers. That frees the speedy unit to make the plays.</p>
        <p>Martin succinctly said the Patriots' defensive front is a major concern and called it as good as any in the league, singling out linebacker Ted Johnson, who has 34 tackles.</p>
        <p>''He's a brick wall,'' Martin said. ''Hopefully you'll get around him.''</p>
        <p>The quarterback protection will be of particular import today. The Jets' quarterbacks have been sacked only four times this season (the play on which Testaverde was hurt last Sunday was not a sack), and Testaverde said last week that the Patriots might be punished for a heavy blitz by giving up quick scoring strikes. But Groh, the Jets' coach, knows the importance of a potent pass rush; he drafted two pass rushers with the first two picks in the draft, after all.</p>
        <p>''One of our primary tasks in the game is to get to the Patriots' quarterback because he's an outstanding quarterback,'' Groh said of Drew Bledsoe. ''I would think they'd be thinking that way. If they knew that our quarterback was made of steel and no hits would hurt him, they'd still be trying to knock him down. This just puts an exclamation on it.''</p>
        <p>The Jets' offensive line is trying to regain its equilibrium after a brutal performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers in which guard Randy Thomas missed a block that allowed Testaverde to be hit and led to his exit, three linemen were charged with penalties, and tackle Jason Fabini gave up a sack and a fumble.</p>
        <p>The offensive line seemed like one of the Jets' strongest units until last week. But Groh, a practitioner of tough love, was still in no mood to toss a soothing bouquet to an offensive line that will have to create running lanes for Martin while protecting a targeted quarterback.</p>
        <p>''Where we are now is where we were last Sunday,'' Groh said. ''Your resume means little in terms of who you are and what you've done. We got off to a nice start, but we didn't play very well last week. Not from an execution standpoint, nor from a toughness standpoint.''</p>
        <p>That characterization did not sit well with the offensive line.</p>
        <p>''To question our toughness,'' Mawae said, ''whatever.''</p>
        <p>But Mawae admitted that the offensive linemen did not finish off their blocks last week and that today they must enter the game with the mind-set that the Jets will run the ball, over and over.</p>
        <p>''None of the five starters will crack under any kind of pressure,'' Mawae said. ''We'll go out there and smack people in the mouth if we have to.''</p>
