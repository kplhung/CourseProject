        <p>Frank J. Prial II, publisher of The Chief, a newspaper for government workers in New York City, died Sunday at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. He was 80 and lived in Greenwich.</p>
        <p>The cause was pulmonary failure, his family said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prial's grandfather, Frank J. Prial, bought the weekly in 1917, and Mr. Prial joined it in 1945 after Army service. He became publisher after his grandfather died in 1948.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prial, a lawyer, was also counsel to public employee unions for more than 30 years. In 1985, he retired from the law and stopped writing a column for The Chief, but remained its publisher until his death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prial is survived by his wife, Marguerite; four daughters, Marguerite Petrie of Manhasset, N.Y.; Patricia Gillooly of Fanwood, N.J.; Pamela James of Framingham, Mass.; and Helen Snyder of Trumbull, Conn.; six sons, Frank, of Manchester, Vt.; Edward, of Stamford, Conn.; Gerard, of New Castle, N.H.; James, of Ridgefield, Conn.; Michael, of Greenwich; Joseph, of Simsbury, Conn.; and two sisters: Mildred Robinson of Hillsdale, N.J.; and Patricia Lowe of Greenwich; and 18 grandchildren.</p>
