        <p>IT'S the season for spooks and haunts and Connecticut has it all. You can find everything from Colonial graveyards to Halloween theme parks, from simple hayrides through the woods to elaborate haunted houses. The only limitations are your stamina, your ''fright factor'' and the ages of other members of your party.</p>
        <p>One of the larger sites this year will be The Haunted Graveyard at Lake Compounce in Bristol. Although this has been a popular feature at Lyman Orchards for the past decade, crowds outgrew the available space and Lake Compounce has become the new site.</p>

        <p>IT'S the season for spooks and haunts and Connecticut has it all. You can find everything from Colonial graveyards to Halloween theme parks, from simple hayrides through the woods to elaborate haunted houses. The only limitations are your stamina, your ''fright factor'' and the ages of other members of your party.</p>
        <p>One of the larger sites this year will be The Haunted Graveyard at Lake Compounce in Bristol. Although this has been a popular feature at Lyman Orchards for the past decade, crowds outgrew the available space and Lake Compounce has become the new site.</p>
        <p>Richard Bisi, a spokesman for Lake Compounce, gave some background.</p>
        <p>''The Haunted Graveyard literally started in someone's backyard 10 years ago,'' Mr. Bisi said. Its creator designed it for his daughter, who had diabetes. ''She couldn't understand why she couldn't go trick-or-treating, so he built the graveyard and made it a neighborhood thing. He later moved it to Lyman Orchards, where as a weekend event it drew up to 43,000 people each season.''</p>
        <p>Lake Compounce managers were excited by the collaboration, looking for ways to theme the park for Halloween. Guests enter through a fog-filled tunnel with eerie lighting. Inside the park, the carousel and flower beds have been replaced with ghouls, goblins and witches.</p>
        <p>''The tone is set as soon as people enter the park,'' Mr. Bisi said. ''Boulder Dash, Lake Compounce's well-known roller coaster, features surprises at the top of the hill and a new ride, Ghost Hunt, is an interactive dark ride.'' Two guests ride through a dark mansion, shooting at ghosts.</p>
        <p>There are also options for the less adventurous. Kiddie Land features a Halloween Magic Show and a Garfield Spooktacular. The Haunted Graveyard is recommended for adults and brave children.</p>
        <p>Guests have four options: rides and the graveyard, just the graveyard, just the rides or general admission, for those wishing to enter the park but not participate in the activities. Ticket proceeds benefit the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.</p>
        <p>Lake Compounce is open from 5 to 10 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and Oct. 30 and 31. On Fridays and Saturdays the graveyard is open until midnight. For information call (860) 583-3300.</p>
        <p>Another Halloween event, depending on dark woods and spooks for its thrills, is the Haunted Hayride at Indian Rock Nature Preserve, 501 Wolcott Road, Bristol. Lola Boss, spokeswoman for Indian Rock, a 166-acre preserve, said more than 800 people visit Indian Rock each year for a spooky, hourlong tractor-drawn hayride past the lake and through dark woods. Scary props and characters in the woods make it an exciting event, and it is not recommended for children under 7. The wagon stops on occasion to allow riders to interact with some of the ghouls. The first ride of the evening begins at 7 and hayrides continue every 20 minutes. There are seven hayrides each evening, Oct. 20, 21, 27 and 28.</p>
        <p>Tickets should be purchased in advance; sales benefit the preserve. For more information call Indian Rock at (860) 583-1234.</p>
        <p>Bunnell Farm is another opportunity to benefit a good cause and enjoy a rich Halloween experience. Bunnell Farm, on Maple Street off Route 202 in Bantam, is a pick-your-own pumpkin farm that has hosted a Lions Club fund-raiser for the past 10 years.</p>
        <p>Helen Bunnell, whose farm will supply cider, pumpkin and gourds to visitors, said the Lions Club creates a haunted house inside an old barn, complete with 12 spooky scenarios.</p>
        <p>''It's really scary in there,'' she said. ''Ten to 15 minutes is long enough for most people. They do a really good job of scaring the wits out of at least a few people in each group.''</p>
        <p>Characters will act out scenes from the movie ''The Return of Freddy Kruger'' this year.</p>
        <p>The haunted house will be open Friday and Saturday evenings through Oct. 28, from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Call (860) 567-9576 for more information.</p>
        <p>For the more sophisticated trick-or-treater, there is the Witch's Dungeon Classic Movie Museum, 90 Battle Street, Bristol. Cortlandt Hull, whose great-uncle, Henry Hull, played the first movie werewolf in the 1935 production of ''Werewolf of London,'' is the owner.</p>
        <p>His museum features life-size exhibits based on personalities like Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney (junior and senior) and Vincent Price.</p>
        <p>''It's like a wax museum,'' Mr. Hull said. ''They have glass eyes, human hair, and voice tracks carry you through the museum. This year we'll also have some original movie props, like the head from 'E.T.' and the Golden Idol from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' ''</p>
        <p>It's a small museum, he added, and it's really geared toward movie buffs. ''It's a different kind of place, almost like you stepped onto a movie set, without the blood and gore,'' Mr. Hull said. ''Movie buffs and whole families come back year after year. This is not just a 'jump out and yell boo!' kind of format.''</p>
        <p>The museum was a natural extension of his fascination with horror movies, werewolves and the like, Mr. Hull said. ''It's in the blood.''</p>
        <p>The Witch's Dungeon is open from 7 to 10 p.m. on Oct. 20, 22, and 27 through 31. Sara Karloff will visit on Oct. 20 to talk about her father, Boris Karloff. Contact the Witch's Dungeon at (860) 583-8306.</p>
        <p>A pair of brothers from Connecticut, Robert and Charles Betollati, also passionate about Halloween and scary things, have joined forces to create Haunted Mountain at the Thunder Ridge Ski Area in Patterson, N.Y. For the past 10 years they have worked on other Halloween shows and decided to go out on their own this year. Since April they have been working on a scary hayride, haunted house and corn maze.</p>
        <p>''The hayride is one mile long,'' said Charles Betollati, of New Preston, ''and certain things along the trail are designed to get you. We try to entertain people in a variety of ways.''</p>
        <p>The haunted house is a disorienting maze of 14 rooms, but Charles Betollati refused to give away specific details. He doesn't want anyone to know what to expect.</p>
        <p>He and his brother were used to writing their own skits and acting them out in other Halloween shows, so creating Haunted Mountain has been exciting for both of them. Charles Betollati owns Betollati Roofing and Siding, where Robert also works. What they dream of, Charles added, is such a successful year at Haunted Mountain that they never have time to do roofing and siding anymore.</p>
        <p>''This is a big operation with lots of special effects,'' Charles Betollati added. ''We have our own special sound system, unusual equipment and a great crew of people.''</p>
        <p>The hayride, he added, is O.K. for most children and adults, although it is geared toward an older crowd. He doesn't recommend it for any child under 8. The house, however, may be too much for children of all ages.</p>
        <p>''The house is more enclosed; it's difficult to keep kids from panicking and trying to get out of the house,'' Charles Betollati said.</p>
        <p>People who scare easily are also not encouraged to venture through its doors.</p>
        <p>Also at Haunted Mountain is a giant corn maze, created by another person on the Betollati team. The design came out of a child's coloring book, Charles Betollati said, ''but it really works.''</p>
        <p>The ticket packages let guests opt for the hayride, the haunted house and the maze, or any event separately. Haunted Mountain is open every week, Thursday through Sunday, until Oct. 29, with the first wagon rolling out at about 7:30 p.m. Charles Betollati suggests making reservation online at www.hauntedmoun tain.com so the staff has some idea how many people are coming at once.</p>
        <p>More information is available at (914) 878-4100.</p>
        <p>Other Halloween events around Connecticut include The Trail of Terror, at 176 North Colony Road, Wallingford. This is a volunteer-operated benefit for the American Red Cross. Dates are Oct. 20-22 and 27-31. Call (203) 781-8624 for more information.</p>
        <p>Haunting at Blue Jay Orchards, Bethel, Oct. 20, 21, 27 and 28, is an annual event hosted by The Bethel Jaycees. Proceeds benefit the community. Call (203) 798-0201.</p>
        <p>The Farmington Graveyard Tour puts a more serious twist on Halloween fun with a guided walking tour of two ancient graveyards. Guests get to learn about Colonial burial methods, view gravestone carvings and hear legends of early settlers. Departures are scheduled almost every night in October and every Friday and Saturday evening in November. Call (860) 677-8867 or visit www.charteroaktree.com/farming tontour.html.</p>
        <p>Another setting for Halloween is the tomblike interior of Old New-Gate Prison, Newgate Road, off Route 20 in East Granby. It will present the ''Sixth Annual Marquis of Granby Halloween'' on Oct. 27 and 28. Guests will be treated to Colonial music, dancing, drama and displays. Dress in costume and enjoy face painting, storytelling, a haunted mine tour and an above-ground tour. Call for times and admission, (860) 653-3563. Bring a flashlight!</p>
