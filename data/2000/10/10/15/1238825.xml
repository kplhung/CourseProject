        <p>THE St. Louis Symphony Orchestra arrives at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday and Thursday evenings bearing not only double basses and French horns packed with pride but also other baggage: the same burden of harsh fiscal reality that even in these flush economic times chafes many other American orchestras.</p>
        <p>On its tally sheet, the orchestra counts substantial artistic dividends from the music directorship of Hans Vonk, the 58-year-old Dutch conductor now in his fifth season at the helm. There is a palpable spirit of camaraderie inside Powell Symphony Hall, the orchestra's elegantly appointed home. Also in the credit column is a reinvigorated community outreach program, which sends orchestra players into the city and suburbs alike to put a friendly, personal face on classical music. Partnerships with 30 black churches have helped the orchestra become a better citizen of its neighborhood, and the churches have responded by helping put listeners in the audience. The theme of the new classical subscription season is, pointedly, ''music for everyone.''</p>
        <p>But all these good things, like a 1998 European tour, which brought glowing reviews, and annual visits to Carnegie Hall, seem to come at a price that isn't quite being met. Over the last 17 or 18 years, the orchestra has accumulated a potentially crippling deficit of $7 million. (Its annual budget is now $26 million for the orchestra itself with an additional $3 million for its music school.)</p>
        <p>''The biggest problem will come if we don't look the beast in the eye,'' said Don Roth, the orchestra's president. The issue is not so much overspending as underfinancing, and Mr. Roth is determined to see the orchestra's endowment increased to $100 million from the current $30 million, and to make sure that all future touring is fully sponsored.</p>
        <p>''This orchestra has been built to greatness without the financial underpinning of a great orchestra,'' Mr. Roth said. ''There has been a series of interim, short fixes. But this is where the Band-Aids fall off and you get the cure. Probably for the first time in the history of this organization, we have laid it out plainly to the community and said it's going to take a hundred million to get it done. People haven't backed away from that.</p>
        <p>''We're not New York or London. St. Louis doesn't automatically have the best of everything. This is a great city with significant social and economic challenges, and the St. Louis Symphony has the opportunity to provide some of the glue that holds the city together.''</p>
        <p>To spend a couple of days at Powell Symphony Hall is to see a certain poetic aptness in Mr. Roth's choice of the word ''glue.'' Within its own organization, the St. Louis Symphony is nothing if not cohesive, in a singular spiritual sense. In conversations with the president, the concertmaster and the music director, a visitor could only be impressed by the aura of accord.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth, who has worked as an administrator at five other orchestras, said that since coming here three years ago, he has been surprised by ''the tremendous caring and the willingness of the musicians to work with other members of the organization.''</p>
        <p>''It's even O.K. to be friendly,'' he said, ''and you don't find that in a lot of orchestras.''</p>
        <p>But at least one cooperative venture between musicians and management has not panned out. Frustrated like many other orchestras by the recording industry's lack of interest in classical projects, the St. Louis Symphony created its own label, Arch Media, last year. The company was run by a board made up of musicians and members of the orchestra's board and staff. The first release, a Beethoven disc, sold 4,200 copies: strong sales for a classical release. But then came the bad news that not even such healthy sales were enough to break even.</p>
        <p>Although Arch Media's long-term plans called for complete cycles of the Beethoven, Mahler and Bruckner symphonies conducted by Mr. Vonk, just four CD's were released before costs overwhelmed revenues. Now, only some chamber-music recordings remain in the works. But Mr. Vonk refuses to grouse about the lost opportunity to record Bruckner end to end, parrying a reminder of the abortive venture with a philosophical shrug. It's a dark age for orchestral recording, he allows, and for now there is nothing to be done.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth, less resigned, said the orchestra would continue to record all of its concerts digitally and wait for technology to catch up. He sees a near future when record collectors will be able to log on to the orchestra's Web site, select the works they want to buy and download them on recordable CD's.</p>
        <p>AFTER the adventurous and artistically prosperous 17-year stewardship of Leonard Slatkin, who left in 1996 and now directs the National Symphony in Washington and the BBC Symphony in London, the St. Louis Symphony has apparently found a satisfying successor in the old-school Mr. Vonk, despite his radically different approach to music-making. Subscriptions are said to have held steady, neither breaking records nor slumping.</p>
        <p>''Leonard Slatkin and Hans Vonk are extremely dissimilar personalities,'' said David Halen, the orchestra's concertmaster. ''The orchestra didn't want a Leonard Slatkin imitator. That would have been an exercise in failure. Leonard made this a virtuoso orchestra. He wanted a certain brilliance in the sound, and he liked to give us extremely difficult music. He always had us on the edge. We would always be sweating bullets at the first concert. But that also made the orchestra really good readers.</p>
        <p>''Hans wants a mellower sound, not quite as flashy, with softer edges. But just as important is the change of emphasis in repertoire. Hans comes from the great Dutch tradition of Van Beinum and Mengelberg, and his focus is on the core repertoire: Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler. But he's also wonderful with Stravinsky and French music, and his Tchaikovsky has a Mozartean purity.'' (The Carnegie programs this week are all Stravinsky.)</p>
        <p>Significant changes have also occurred in the makeup of the orchestra itself. Since Mr. Vonk's arrival, the group has experienced a turnover of 20 players, including the principal flutist, the principal trombonist, the principal second violinist, the second trumpeter and the associate principal cellist. The new hires represent another way in which Mr. Vonk is making the orchestra his own.</p>
        <p>The music at hand on a recent weekend was Brahms's Second Symphony and Berg's Violin Concerto, with Cho-Liang Lin as soloist. The sound that resonated through Powell Symphony Hall, a restored vaudeville theater and movie house, which has served as the orchestra's home since 1968, offered a veritable checklist of the qualities Van Beinum and Mengelberg shared: precision, clarity, subtlety. Mr. Vonk, who prefers good style and expressive playing to virtuoso display, elicited a Brahms Second that was as much chamber music as grand symphony. His tempos were expansive, his musical gestures elegant. Even in the finale's last rousing burst of trumpets, his restraining hand was evident.</p>
        <p>In time, he hopes, the Dutch tradition will also carry Mahler to the hearts of St. Louis audiences. ''I really don't understand it, but our subscribers have no real enthusiasm for Mahler,'' he said. ''I grew up at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, where Bruckner and Mahler were revered like Beethoven.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vonk seems to harbor no doubt that he can bring authentic Mahler to the Midwest. He dismisses any notion that European orchestras come to the core masterworks with an inherent cultural advantage. ''It's nonsense,'' he said. ''The standard of American orchestras, even in the second and third category, is incredibly high.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vonk offers that assessment in the light of a long, far-ranging and sometimes tumultuous career. His first directorship was at the Netherlands Ballet, where in 1962 he met his wife, Jessie, then a teenage prima ballerina. He later directed the Netherlands Opera, the Hague Residentie Orchestra, the Dresden Staatskapelle and Dresden State Opera and, most recently, the Cologne Radio Symphony. His Dresden sojourn, from 1985 to 1990, in the twilight of the East German Communist regime, proved a trial by fire. He describes a constant run of political bickering, inadequate staff support and forbidden socializing between conductor and musicians, all capped by a bureaucratic cabal to oust him.</p>
        <p>By comparison, Mr. Vonk's only real difficulty in St. Louis is that albatross of a deficit, not cause enough for him to rethink his commitment. He recently signed a contract extension that will keep him in St. Louis through the 2004-05 season. Indeed, in the easygoing atmosphere of Powell Symphony Hall, surrounded by musicians and administrators who value his Dutch heritage, Mr. Vonk appears to be settled in for the long haul. He has shown that he is not a quitter, and he knows that cultivating a tradition takes time.</p>
        <p>''You have your ups and downs in life,'' he said, recalling old hopes of becoming music director of the great Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, a post that instead went for the first time to a non-Dutchman, the Italian Riccardo Chailly, in 1988. ''For a long time I was in the picture to succeed Bernard Haitink. That didn't work out for me. Now I am here, and I truly believe I'm in the best position I could possibly be in.''</p>
        <p>Or he will be, if Mr. Roth and the St. Louis Symphony can shed those fiscal Band-Aids and find their $100 million cure.</p>
