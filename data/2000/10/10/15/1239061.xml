        <p>For much of this year, the surging price of oil did not seem to worry stock or bond investors. Even as the price of a barrel of crude jumped from $27 a barrel to $33 in August, the stock market rallied and the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell, dropping well below 6 percent.</p>
        <p>But with the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in early September, investor sentiment seemed to change. Finally, the market realized oil might pose an inflation problem. The three major stock indexes seemed to turn down on cue, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note began to rise.</p>
        <p>The additional 800,000 barrels a day of new production promised by OPEC was not enough to bring prices lower. The 30 million barrels of oil that the Clinton administration made plans to pump from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve helped bring down the price, but it could not break below $30 a barrel.</p>
        <p>Then in October, the Fed said higher oil prices were beginning to be worrisome. ''The increase in energy prices, though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date, poses a risk of raising inflation expectations,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Now Mideast turmoil is keeping oil in the news and helping to keep the price above $30 a barrel.</p>
        <p>If the strong jump in retail sales in September is any indication, American consumers have not yet cut back spending much to make up for the higher cost of driving their cars or heating their homes.</p>
