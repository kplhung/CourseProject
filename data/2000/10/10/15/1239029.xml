        <p>Ever since school started in September, some students at Life Sciences Secondary School on 96th Street and First Avenue have been without textbooks.</p>
        <p>Now, as teachers are preparing student evaluations, the City Council member who represents the area and has been trying to find out why the delay occurred says she has encountered a ''culture of secrecy'' at the city's Board of Education.</p>
        <p>The representative, Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz, complained last month to Schools Chancellor Harold Levy about the shortage and the ''lack of cooperation and disclosure'' she said she found.</p>
        <p>In a letter to the chancellor, she said she had approached the principal, Richard Kaplan, and the office of the Manhattan high school superintendent, seeking copies of the purchase orders for the books but was rebuffed at every step.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, she continued her campaign with a letter to Councilwoman Priscilla A. Wooten, chairwoman of the council's Education Committee, urging that hearings be held on the shortages.</p>
        <p>''We cannot hold students and teachers to higher standards if we don't provide them with the basic tools of learning,'' Ms. Moskowitz wrote.</p>
        <p>As recently as 10 days ago, Ms. Moskowitz said, most textbooks had still had not been distributed to students, and even as late as Thursday, students were still awaiting texts in mathematics, history, health and Spanish.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moskowitz said she has received no reply from Mr. Levy's office, despite daily phone calls.</p>
        <p>''I have met with a culture of secrecy at the Board of Education,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The school's principal, Mr. Kaplan, and Welton Sawyer, the Manhattan high schools superintendent, did not respond to repeated telephone calls seeking comment on the matter.</p>
        <p>Julieanne Sullivan, a parent from Bayside, Queens, said her son Daniel, a sophomore at the school, was so frustrated with the situation he transferred to Benjamin N. Cardozo High School.</p>
        <p>''Last year, he didn't get books until January,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ''The principal assured us it wouldn't happen again this year. But it did.''</p>
        <p>Pam McDonnell, a Board of Education spokeswoman, said part of the problem resulted from a new system for distributing money to school superintendents for textbooks.</p>
        <p>''The chancellor also wants to find out what happened,'' she added. ''He was very clear with all the superintendents. He told them to get in touch with all the principals and tell them to go class to class and find out what textbooks were missing and why.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McDonnell said she planned to respond to Ms. Moskowitz's letter and her allegations promptly.</p>
