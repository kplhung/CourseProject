        <p>Giorgio Armani is reclaiming Katrina Garnett, and her husband, Terence, for himself. Though long an Armani follower, when last we saw her she was wearing a black low-cut cocktail dress by Herve Leger in ads for her start-up, CrossWorlds Software. ''That was kind of shocking,'' said an Armani executive in California.</p>
        <p>Now Ms. Garnett and her husband, who have formed their own venture capital firm, have just returned from the Armani show in Milan. The Garnetts also plan to attend a dinner on Wednesday night at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan celebrating the opening of a 25th anniversary Armani retrospective.</p>
        <p>Ms. Garnett, who remains the CrossWorlds chairman, and her husband are among the entrepreneurs -- Steve Jobs is another, she said --  attracted to the Armani store that opened in San Francisco in 1996. ''Definitely our top clients in San Francisco,'' the Armani executive  said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Garnett now speaks of her Armani allegiance as a civic mission, shared with her foundation, to help turn women into techies. ''They think this industry is nerdy, geeky and unglamorous,'' she said. She predicts that fashion will yet flourish in Silicon Valley, explaining, ''People out here aren't comfortable yet with the wealth to truly enjoy it.''</p>
