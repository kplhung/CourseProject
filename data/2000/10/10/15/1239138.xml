        <p>The Department of Energy said today that it had awarded contracts to nine companies that had bid for oil from the government's reserve in an effort to replenish low supplies of heating oil in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>
        <p>Drew Malcolm, a spokesman for the department, said contracts had been awarded for 23 million barrels of crude oil of the 30 million barrels that the government had wanted to release.</p>
        <p>The first of the crude oil has begun moving into the system ahead of schedule, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said.</p>
        <p>''We're getting a head start in meeting the president's objective of protecting Americans from possible fuel supply disruptions this winter,'' Mr. Richardson added.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Malcolm said, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, one of the companies that received contracts, started moving its allotment from the government's reserve near Freeport, Tex.</p>
        <p>Two companies that had hoped to receive a contract, Euell Energy Resources of Aurora, Colo., and Lance Stroud Enterprises of New York City, were dropped by the government on Friday because they had failed to obtain financial guarantees.</p>
        <p>The chairman of Euell Energy, Renard Euell, said today that he planned to submit a new bid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Euell said his bid, for seven million barrels, was rejected because a partner pulled out at the last minute.</p>
        <p>''If we have the proper partnership, we will bid for the whole thing,'' he said, speaking of the seven million barrels.</p>
        <p>Successful bidders are to sell the 30 million barrels of oil on the open market and then return 31.56 million barrels to the reserve between August and November 2001.</p>
        <p>Oil prices are now high, with contracts for next month closing at $34.99 a barrel on Friday. Prices are expected to be lower when the successful bidders have to replenish the oil, and they will profit by the difference in the price less the additional oil they will have to provide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malcolm said that both Euell and Stroud, which were ruled out because they had failed to provide letters of credit, were welcome to resubmit bids.</p>
        <p>Stroud Enterprises is a one-man oil company that operates out of an office in Harlem. ''I feel like I'm the front of the boat and the government is the rest of the boat,'' Mr. Stroud said in an interview this week. ''I'm parting the waters of this energy crisis with the weight of the government behind me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stroud, who could not be reached by telephone today, was injected into the presidential campaign on Friday when Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, repeated his criticism of the Clinton administration's decision to release the oil and singled out the apparent lack of qualifications of Stroud Enterprises, before he knew the company's bid was dropped.</p>
        <p>''Vice President Gore called for this release and he should take responsibility for what has occurred,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
