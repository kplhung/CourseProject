        <p>Major League Baseball, in conjunction with the St. Louis Cardinals, could have staged an intriguing fan participation contest this postseason. When fans entered the park where the Cardinals were playing that particular day, they could have been handed punch-out computer cards with three questions to answer:</p>
        <p>*Will Manager Tony La Russa use Mark McGwire as a pinch-hitter today?</p>
        <p>*If the answer to No. 1 is Yes, for whom will McGwire bat?</p>
        <p>*In what inning will he bat?</p>
        <p>Winning cards could have been thrown into a bowl and a winner selected. First prize: An all-expenses-paid trip to the Cardinals' opening-day game next season. Second prize: A day at the office with Commissioner Bud Selig.</p>
        <p>McGwire, probably the best known and most appreciated player in baseball today, is in a difficult position in these postseason series, as are the Cardinals. He continues to suffer from tendinitis in his right knee, an ailment that benched him completely for two months of the season, and La Russa can't use him at his usual position of first base.</p>
        <p>As he did for the last three weeks of the season, the manager has used him in the postseason as a pinch-hitter, when he had a situation that called for McGwire. That means one time at bat in each game. McGwire, like any pinch-hitter, takes his turn at the plate, then goes back to the dugout and watches the rest of the game.</p>
        <p>''I have no problem with what I'm doing,'' McGwire said last night after the Cardinals defeated the Mets, 8-2, for their first victory in the National League Championship Series. ''I'm just happy doing what I'm doing. Actually, I'm very surprised that I'm able to do this. If you had asked me a month ago if I was going to be doing this, I'd have said, 'No way.' ''</p>
        <p>La Russa did not find a spot for McGwire in the first game, and when he did find one in the second game, the Cardinals had a runner at second base, making the decision to walk McGwire intentionally with the score tied at 5-5 eminently easy.</p>
        <p>J. D. Drew was the runner at second. He got there by rapping a game-tying double in the eighth inning. La Russa said after the game he had been yelling for Drew to stop at first. Asked before yesterday's game if he would have really preferred Drew stop at first so that the Mets would not have walked McGwire so quickly, La Russa said: ''Oh yeah, absolutely. We were trying to invent a sign where he comes back to first, but we couldn't come up with it.''</p>
        <p>The manager also talked about the difficulty of finding the right spot for this unique pinch-hitter.</p>
        <p>''If I use him for a pitcher, that means the pitcher isn't doing well,'' La Russa said. ''Do I use him for a position player? I'm playing my best players today. Bat him for Drew? Maybe the third time, but the first or second? No.''</p>
        <p>What La Russa did yesterday was have McGwire bat for Ray Lankford in the fourth inning in what would have been Lankford's third at-bat.</p>
        <p>''After the second game, when I was going to hit in the second inning,'' McGwire said of the early call, ''I'm ready in the first inning. Usually I was getting ready in the fifth inning, but now I'm ready right away because we can't afford to lose another game.''</p>
        <p>The Cardinals led the Mets, 5-1, and had the bases loaded with two out in the fourth inning. Glendon Rusch, a left-handed pitcher, was in the game in relief of Rick Reed. La Russa figured this was a good time to put the game beyond the Mets' reach. ''It seemed like a good time to do it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rusch had encountered McGwire before. McGwire, in fact, had fared quite well against the former Kansas City pitcher, lashing four hits in six at-bats. One of those hits became a part of history because it was No. 37 of the record-shattering 70 home runs McGwire hit in 1998. The ball traveled 472 feet into the upper tier at St. Louis's Busch Stadium.</p>
        <p>As McGwire walked toward the plate, the Shea Stadium fans stirred with anticipation. Some stood and began cheering, though it wasn't immediately clear if they were cheering for the popular McGwire, for the chance to see him bat or for the chance to see the Mets get him out.</p>
        <p>Rusch fired his first pitch, and it was high and inside. McGwire ducked his head slightly. The next pitch was more hittable, and he hit a foul fly toward right field.</p>
        <p>As Rusch prepared to throw his third pitch, the noise from the crowd grew. Rusch threw a fastball and McGwire swung, lofting the ball to left field. Some fans weren't sure how well he had hit it. They watched as Benny Agbayani drifted back.</p>
        <p>If they were holding their breath, they exhaled when they saw Agbayani stop drifting after a few feet. Still on the grass, he caught the ball to the cheers of the crowd.</p>
        <p>Once again the Mets had neutralized McGwire. ''I just hit the bottom part of the ball,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Before the game, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine was asked if it wasn't a drain on a team's roster to have McGwire on it, knowing he was limited to one at-bat.</p>
        <p>''Not at all,'' Valentine replied. ''He's a major weapon, a major force. The only negative about it is he's not starting. Having him is a major force. He's in scoring position when he walks up to the plate.''</p>
