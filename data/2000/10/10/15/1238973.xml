        <p>Jenifer Anne Steig and William Randolph Strugger are to be married today by Cantor Theodore Aronson at the Manhattan Penthouse.</p>
        <p>The bride, 37, is a partner in the Cheshire Group, a real estate company in Manhattan. She graduated from Cornell University and received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. She is the daughter of Janet and Donald Steig of Short Hills, N.J. Her father owns Practical Computer Solutions, a consulting business in Short Hills. Her mother is the president of the Crossroads Financial Group, a financial planning and insurance company in Roseland, N.J.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, also 37, is a business development manager in the Manhattan sales office of the EMC Corporation, the data-storage equipment manufacturer. He graduated from Rutgers University. He is a son of Lois and Earl Strugger of Boynton Beach, Fla. His mother retired as a librarian at Fisher Middle School in Ewing, N.J. His father, also retired, owned Bear Tavern Antiques, a mail-order business in West Trenton, N.J.</p>
        <p>When a couple is described as beaming at one another, an image of candlelight and Champagne might come to mind. But when this couple beam at one another, they are as likely to be aiming their Palm Pilots.</p>
        <p>They met in March 1999 at a party given by a mutual friend. They hit it off immediately, so the next step was finding time to spend together.</p>
        <p>''Jen and I, like most New Yorkers, are very busy,'' Mr. Strugger said. ''It's a task just figuring out how to get together.'' That is where the Palm Pilots came in. Within weeks of their meeting, the two found these electronic planning gadgets so indispensable to coordinating their activities -- time with his young daughter from a previous marriage, time with family and friends, time for theater and, of course, time together -- that they came to refer affectionately to their time spent organizing as P.P.M.'s: Palm Pilot Moments.</p>
        <p>The Palm Pilot played another large part in their life together. Last March, before heading for drinks at Beekman Tower on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to celebrate the one-year anniversary of their meeting, Mr. Strugger persuaded Ms. Steig to bring her Palm Pilot.</p>
        <p>''At first, I resisted,'' she said. ''The Beekman Tower is a beautiful Art Deco building with a restaurant that has a panoramic view of the city. I didn't see how Palm Pilots would add to the romance.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Strugger convinced her that they needed to do more scheduling, for romantic things like a vacation. At the restaurant that evening, sitting across a small table from one another, her half-finished cosmopolitan and his half-finished martini between them, they had completed their scheduling when he said, ''I have one more thing I'm beaming over to you.''</p>
        <p>Incoming messages on Palm Pilots are preceded by the subject of the message and by the question ''Will you accept this message?'' In this case, the subject line read, ''Marriage Proposal.''</p>
        <p>''I knew what the message was going to be, but wanted to see it -- I wanted to see what he had actually written,'' the bride said. The problem was that her Palm Pilot had been acting up that evening, and she had to jab the stylus into the screen repeatedly before it would display the message itself. Once she read the proposal, she said yes the old-fashioned way: she kissed him.</p>
