        <p>James Oestreich, in his article ''A Model Festival for London. But for New York?'' [Sept. 24], asks whether the London Proms would be successful in New York, but is not sure.</p>
        <p>New York, back in the 1960's, had its own Promenade Concerts every summer at Lincoln Center. In Philharmonic Hall (now known as Avery Fisher Hall) all the seats in the orchestra were removed and replaced by tables and chairs where patrons could have light snacks and drinks. Lincoln Center was decorated for the occasion.</p>

        <p>Andre Kostelanetz was the music director of this summer festival and the New York Philharmonic played light pop, light classics and the regular repertory. Each week was linked to some theme; there was Russian week, French week, opera week. There were plenty of encores. These concerts were very well attended; however, they died when Kostelanetz did. No one replaced him and the Promenades were history. This type of summer fare would make more sense than what is now being offered.</p>
