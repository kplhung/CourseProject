        <p>LITERARY SEDUCTIONS</p>
        <p>Compulsive Writers</p>

        <p>By Frances Wilson.</p>

        <p>So seductive was Byron's poetry that only when the poet left the country, it was said, could Regency husbands sleep in peace. So begins ''Literary Seductions,'' Frances Wilson's exploration of writing, reading, love and sex, a romp through literary history to increase our awareness of writers who make us love them. Words always attempt to seduce, writes Wilson, who teaches English literature at Reading University in England. Her examples range from the romantic affair of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning to the erotically charged relationship of Henry Miller and Anas Nin. Such compulsive writers channel into writing emotions that would otherwise be expressed sexually, Wilson argues. After their first sexual encounter, Nin was surprised that Miller did not make love in his prose style or even in the prose style of D. H. Lawrence, whom he admired; the seductiveness of Miller's writing appeared to be far more sexually invigorating for her than his body. Miller claimed to be drunk with desire, not to see or touch but to write to her. Laura Riding was also involved in a literary seduction in which writing and bodies were virtually interchangeable, since for her a sexual rejection meant a rejection of poetry itself. Robert Graves, her lover and collaborator (and another compulsive writer), viewed her as his muse, loving her ''beyond anything thinkable.'' John Crowe Ransom once commented dryly that Riding assumed that liking her poetry was the equivalent of burning with suppressed libidinous desire for her. This pleasurable book suffers slightly from Wilson's constant references to psychoanalysis and mythology; sometimes apt, they more often inspire a grin and a very long stretch.</p>
