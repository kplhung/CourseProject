        <p>HALLOWEEN may be two weeks off, but ghosts will soon be flying in Madison Square Park. ''The Influence Machine,'' an installation by Tony Oursler that opens on Thursday evening, uses projections onto smoke and trees to create ghostly images.</p>
        <p>The projections consist of large faces (like the one at left) speaking broken narratives, both poetry written by Mr. Oursler for the project and texts from the history of electronic technology. The debris from construction in the park becomes part of the presentation and texts are shown on temporary fencing. A human voice emanates from a lamppost that transmits a message using blinking lights. The elements of the presentation seek to illustrate the pervasiveness of television, telephones and the Internet.</p>

        <p>The installation is the first in a series, ''Target Art in the Park,'' which is organized by the Public Art Fund and financed through a gift from Target Stores to the City Parks Foundation.</p>
        <p>''The Influence Machine'' Thursday through Oct. 31, from sunset until 9 p.m.; Madison Square Park, Fifth Avenue near 24th Street; free; (212) 980-3942.</p>
