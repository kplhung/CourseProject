        <p>Two years ago, County Executive Andrew J. Spano designated Dec. 18 as Dr. Kevin Maloney Day in honor of the 48-year-old family practitioner who runs a free clinic in Mamaroneck for anyone who cannot afford medical care.

        <p>IT'S only 64 days till Dr. Kevin Maloney Day. If that doesn't ring any bells, how about 71 days till Christmas? They are connected.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, County Executive Andrew J. Spano designated Dec. 18 as Dr. Kevin Maloney Day in honor of the 48-year-old family practitioner who runs a free clinic in Mamaroneck for anyone who cannot afford medical care. Mr. Spano chose the December date because the doctor also gives out thousands of toys to needy children at an annual holiday party, this year to be held Dec. 15.</p>
        <p>''These kids are really poor -- they don't get much, and when they get even used toys that other people have discarded, their eyes light up,'' Dr. Maloney said. ''So imagine how thrilled they are with something brand new.'' Sister Theresa Warganz, a longtime volunteer at the clinic, said she expects 1,500 children at this year's party.</p>
        <p>The doctor's office managers, Nancy Fanelli and Rebecca Balesh, have volunteered many hours publicizing the drive and sorting the toys that have started to come in. (To donate new, unwrapped toys for children up to age 14, call 914-381-2091, which is also the number for information about the clinic.)</p>
        <p>The clinic is observing its 10th anniversary. Clinic hours are on Friday evenings beginning at 5. All anyone has to do is go to the clinic at 320 East Boston Post Road in Mamaroneck for a free exam, X-rays, blood work, inoculations and medications. There are no criteria for patients; no proof of need is required.</p>
        <p>''It is a myth, a false stereotype, that everyone in Westchester is affluent,'' Dr. Maloney said, adding that thousands of patients are not quite poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford to buy decent insurance because they are part-time or freelance workers or temporarily out of a job.</p>
        <p>''The clinic reminds me of why I became a doctor,'' he said. ''If you read the Hippocratic Oath and take it seriously, you know it's not a job, it's a calling. You live it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.''</p>
