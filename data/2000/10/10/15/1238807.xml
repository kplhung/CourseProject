        <p>THE one sits in life-size bronze majesty, surrounded by her generals and other illustrious men, overlooking the Ring opposite the Burgtor entrance to the Hofburg; the other displays her tiny waist -- it looks to be about 17 inches -- and flowing tresses on chocolate boxes in many a pastry-shop window. Although different in almost every respect, the two empresses, the 18th-century monarch Maria Theresa and her 19th-century successor Elizabeth, the wife of Francis Joseph, are alike in serving as Vienna's tutelary spirits. They are especially present in the city's two great Hapsburg palaces, the Hofburg and Schonbrunn.</p>
        <p>Maria Theresa was born in 1717, in the Hofburg, the palace at the center of the then fortified city. She was the daughter and heir of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and the last male Hapsburg, who tried to ensure succession in the female line through the so-called Pragmatic Sanction. She holds a copy of that document on her monument, unveiled in 1888, on the Ringstrasse.</p>
        <p>When Maria Theresa was 18, she married Francis Stephen of Lorraine, who was not her parents' first choice, but her own. When she came to the throne in 1740, at the age of 23, neighboring princes were quick to try to take advantage of her supposed vulnerability. No one anticipated her stubbornness. With the help of her armies, and especially her loyal and crafty diplomatic advisor, Prince Kaunitz, she retained the greater part of her father's empire and, in 1745, saw her husband crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Schonbrunn, the summer palace in a suburb of Vienna, was built for her pleasure.</p>
        <p>The great age of Austrian Baroque had passed when Maria Theresa began her palace. Although earlier plans had been drawn up by J. B. Fischer von Erlach, the architect of the St. Charles Church, among other Viennese landmarks, the actual project fell to an Italian, Nicola Pacassi, who worked on it from 1744 to 1749.</p>
        <p>The facade of Schonbrunn's main building is relatively simple, and stretches out for what looks like miles -- there are between 1,250 and 1,440 rooms, depending on who's counting. It is painted Maria Theresa Yellow, a hue that remains ubiquitous throughout Austria even today -- a cynic might suppose it had been on sale that year.</p>
        <p>A vast park spreads out behind the palace, embracing formal flower beds, pleached allees, fountains, imitation Roman ruins, assorted pleasure pavilions, a charming zoo (the oldest in Europe) and dozens of allegorical statues. The landscape rises steeply to a crest overlooking the city, crowned by a splendid arcaded folly called the Gloriette, built in 1775 to commemorate one of Maria Theresa's military victories. Most of the park has been open to the public from the very beginning, and it is popular with joggers as well as the floods of tourists in high season. But because of its ingenious nooks and crannies and surprise vistas, it is possible to feel quite alone.</p>
        <p>SCHONBRUNN'S interior is giddily, deliriously Rococo. The grandest room by far is the Great Gallery, some 140 feet of glitter, lighted by three vast but surprisingly delicate chandeliers of gilded wood. Arched windows find their mirrored twins; the ceiling is painted with allegories glorifying Austria. But for all its grandeur, the room lifts the heart; it is easy to imagine it serving as a ballroom during the Congress of Vienna -- indeed, it's hard not to break into a waltz. (Maria Theresa was given to staying up and dancing all night, but the waltz hadn't been invented yet.) In 1961, Kennedy had his tense confrontation with Khrushchev in these heady surroundings.</p>
        <p>The Small Gallery that abuts the grand one is flanked by two small salons full of brightly colored chinoiserie; one, the Round Chinese Room, contains a secret staircase leading to the apartments above, which in Maria Theresa's time were assigned to Kaunitz. She was thus able to meet him for confidential conferences; a dining table that could be hoisted, fully set, from the lower regions further guaranteed privacy -- not even the servants could listen in. (Schonbrunn, it may be noted, is a warren of hidden passages and hallways and entrances and exits, of great interest to the gossips of several centuries.)</p>
        <p>The nearby Mirror Hall, also white and gold, is where Mozart, then age 6, played for Maria Theresa. Afterward, it is reported, he jumped into her capacious lap and covered her face with kisses, which were returned. The empress eventually had 16 children of her own, of whom 12, among them the ill-fated Marie Antoinette, survived infancy.</p>
        <p>Mementos of family life abound: the Porcelain Room, for instance, is ornamented with blue-and-white ink drawings a la chinoise, executed by Francis Stephen and two of his daughters (the two are not identified); the Million Room, so called because it reportedly cost a million florins to decorate, is paneled with rosewood inset with scenes assembled by the whole family from cut-up Persian and Indian miniatures. The gilded frames in which they are mounted are marvels of convolution.</p>
        <p>When Francis Stephen died in 1765, Maria Theresa went into mourning. For this purpose, she installed the Old Lacquer Room, solemn walnut with black lacquered panels. It is impossible to doubt the sincerity of her grief; it is likewise impossible to feel mournful here for very long, since the panels are ornamented with Japanese scenes, picked out in gold, and giddy Rococo curlicues are rampant. The presence here of a posthumous portrait of her husband, painted by Pompeo Batoni, probably helped her focus. She herself died in  1780, at the age of 63, after taking a severe chill during a pheasant hunt on the Schonbrunn grounds.</p>
        <p>The Maria Theresa one meets at Schonbrunn is a comfortably solid figure. Elizabeth, however, is more elusive, as she was in life. She was the daughter of Maximilian of Bavaria, and as such, closely related to the handsome (but loony) Mad King Ludwig, whom she somewhat resembled. No wonder, then, that she was subject to fits of depression and had a lifelong fear of going crazy. In 1854, when she was 16, she married her cousin, Francis Joseph, Maria Theresa's great-grandson, who had become emperor after the rebellions and upsets of 1848.</p>
        <p>Although Francis Joseph was a dashing, handsome boy of 18 when he came to the throne, the more common image of him is as he was in later life, a bald, pious, hard-working and rather dull man.</p>
        <p>One of the first rooms on exhibit at Schonbrunn, where he was born in 1830, is the austere chamber where he died in 1916, with its narrow iron bed and prie-dieu. He was a man of frugal habits, taking a meal of boiled beef and beer every day; in the state dining room, we are told, formal dinners never lasted more than an hour, and visiting ambassadors often fled to the Sacher Hotel for something to eat. (The Hofburg, where festivities were likewise truncated, is conveniently near the venerable hotel.)</p>
        <p>The grand official bedroom, which  was occasionally shared by Francis Joseph and Elizabeth, is ornately furnished and hung with rich blue silk. Elizabeth's own suite of rooms contains further memorabilia of Maria Theresa, among them portraits of some of her children and a desk that once belonged to Marie Antoinette. Of Elizabeth herself, we have chiefly photographs, which show that she really was a beauty. The chocolate boxes do not exaggerate.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth spent increasingly shorter periods of time at Schonbrunn, especially after the death of her only son, Crown Prince Rudolf, who, in 1889, committed suicide at the royal hunting lodge at Mayerling. This is now the official version of the event: until relatively recently, the party line was ''No one really knows what happened at Mayerling.'' But Rudolf's 17-year-old mistress, Maria von Vetsera, who died with him and presumably by his hand, still gets short shrift in most histories.</p>
        <p>Most of Elizabeth's last years were spent traveling feverishly from resort to resort, until in 1898 she fetched up in Geneva: certainly the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
        <p>The Italian anarchist who stabbed her to death in front of the Beau Rivage Hotel said he had no idea who she was, only that she was someone important; the morbidly curious will find the barouche in which she rode to her fatal destination in the Schonbrunn carriage museum.</p>
        <p>Back in the center of town, the Hofburg complex reflects many styles and periods. Some of its best sections are Baroque, from the period of Charles VI, father of Maria Theresa, among them the Winter Riding School, which now houses the Spanish Riding School. Its splendidly columned and galleried white-on-white interior may be seen, if you don't attend a performance of the Lipizzaner horses, in the huge painting that gives Schonbrunn's Carousel Room its name. Its subject is a sort of quadrille performed by royal ladies in golden carriages in celebration of a military victory in 1743.</p>
        <p>Charles VI was also responsible for installing Hapsburg treasures of all ages in the Schatzkammer, or Treasury, where one can see knock-your-eye-out objects like the mostly 11th-century jeweled, enameled and pearl-bedecked golden crown of the Holy German Roman Empire and the gold-and-pearl embroidered coronation regalia that was probably made in Palermo for King Roger of Sicily in the 12th century.</p>
        <p>One of the most recent parts of the Hofburg, the St. Michael's Wing, completed in 1893, borrows from the Baroque; the patinated green dome, with its scallops and tassels, is a copy of those of the two little pavilions that stand on either side of the garden entrance of the Upper Belvedere, part of the monumental palace complex southeast of the inner city designed by Lukas von Hildebrandt for Prince Eugene of Savoy. But Hildebrandt's conceit has been coarsened in reproduction. The same is probably true of the imperial apartments, although it is hard to say for sure. The rooms in the Leopoldine Wing that Maria Theresa decorated to her own taste now house the offices of the President of the Austrian Republic and assorted ministers, and are not open to the public. One can guess, however, that they are fizzy and gilded and lighter than air.</p>
        <p>THE neo-Rococo apartments built for Francis Joseph and Elizabeth, however, lack joy, perhaps a reflection of the lives led in them, but more likely the 19th-century taste for ornamentation without charm. There is too much regal red, too much gold in the gold-and-white, and the twiddly bits are without comedy. Francis Joseph's spartan ways are especially evident in the study where he toiled at his desk from the crack of dawn. It was in this room that he learned of Rudolf's death; here, also, hangs the much-reproduced Francis Xavier Winterhalter portrait of Elizabeth (there is another in the sumptuously furnished main drawing room). The spartan aspect of Elizabeth's own character is demonstrated by the gymnastic equipment, including a set of flying rings, in her dressing room. She is known to have arisen nearly as early as her workaholic husband to preserve her figure. A life-size statue in the grand antechamber shows her still wasp-waisted at the age of about 50.</p>
        <p>The two empresses are entombed in the crypts beneath the Capuchin Church, a stone's throw from the Hofburg on Neuer Markt. The imperial crypts, established by the Emperor Matthias in 1618, contain the mortal remains, or at least the bodies, of some 140 Hapsburgs. (Their hearts and entrails are kept elsewhere.) Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen share an enormous double sarcophagus by Balthasar Moll. Their lead effigies, dressed to the nines, face each other companionably, as if having a nice chat. Each corner of the stately bier is marked by one of the imperial crowns: Holy Roman German Empire, Hungary, Bohemia and Jerusalem. The semi-reclining couple look happy to be there, in the prospect of an eternal reunion in heaven.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth lies alone, in a relatively modest sarcophagus. If there is no effigy or crown, there are flowers, both artificial and fresh. A few wreaths are tied with red-white-and-green ribbons, in homage to her role as Queen of Hungary. She remains popular there to this day, and in Budapest guides will tell you that she often went there ''for love reasons.'' One hopes so.</p>
        <p>If you go</p>
        <p>Schonbrunn Palace is open daily 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. November through March, and 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. April through October; the grounds are open daily from 6 a.m. to sunset. Of the two self-guided tours, the longer, which includes 45 rooms and costs about $8 (at 15.6 Austrian schillings to $1), is recommended. The carriage museum is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday to Sunday, November through March, and daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. April through October; admission is about $4.</p>
        <p>The charming zoo opens at 9 a.m. every day, and remains open until 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., depending on season, and costs about $6. There are snack stands, several pleasant cafes (one, decorated with paintings of animals, is installed in the 18th-century pleasure pavilion in the middle of the zoo), and a Sissi boutique stocked with books, umbrellas, prints, scarves and jigsaw puzzles relating to the Empress Elizabeth and to other Viennese icons like Mozart and Klimt.</p>
        <p>In the Hofburg, the Imperial apartments are open daily 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; admission is about $5. The Schatzkammer is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily except Tuesday; admission is about $6. The Imperial crypt, in the Capuchin Church on Neuer Markt, is open daily 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.; admission is about $4.</p>
