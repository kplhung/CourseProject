        <p>It's election time at the United Nations, too. An unusually intense fight for five rotating seats on the Security Council went into four rounds of secret ballots in the General Assembly before Mauritius, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean, was able to beat back a bid by Sudan -- with a little help from friends in Washington.  Among the Europeans, Ireland won handily but Norway, the eventual winner, and Italy had to battle it out for the second vacant seat. Colombia and Singapore won the Latin American and Asian seats uncontested. The new members' two-year terms will begin Jan. 1, 2001.</p>
