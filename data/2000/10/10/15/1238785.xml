      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Kevin Henkes has a way with mice. He makes them human. And therein lies the charm of characters like Lilly, whose headstrong ways get her into trouble in ''Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse'' and ''Julius, the Baby of the World,'' and like Chrysanthemum, whose name causes her angst in ''Chrysanthemum.'' And now Henkes brings us Wemberly, whose worries never seem to end.</p>
        <p>Into Wemberly Henkes has poured anxieties that all children must confront: Will Mom and Dad still be there in the morning? What if I'm different from everyone else? Will I fit in at my new school? At home, Wemberly's mother and father comfort her when she worries that the bath water will make her shrink or that the tree in the front yard will crash onto the house.</p>

        <p>Kevin Henkes has a way with mice. He makes them human. And therein lies the charm of characters like Lilly, whose headstrong ways get her into trouble in ''Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse'' and ''Julius, the Baby of the World,'' and like Chrysanthemum, whose name causes her angst in ''Chrysanthemum.'' And now Henkes brings us Wemberly, whose worries never seem to end.</p>
        <p>Into Wemberly Henkes has poured anxieties that all children must confront: Will Mom and Dad still be there in the morning? What if I'm different from everyone else? Will I fit in at my new school? At home, Wemberly's mother and father comfort her when she worries that the bath water will make her shrink or that the tree in the front yard will crash onto the house.</p>
        <p>Later, on her first day of school, she clings to her doll and her mother's skirt, watching all the other children frolic. Well, almost all of them. At school, Wemberly meets Jewel, and together they find comfort in their shared anxieties. Readers of Henkes's previous books will recognize much in WEMBERLY WORRIED (Greenwillow, $15.95; ages 4 to 8): the mice with the triangular faces, the multitude of small watercolor pictures against open white pages, and Henkes's flair for capturing the sheer joy of children at play. There are new gems, as well, like the grandmother with a cane, roller skates and a ''Go With the Flow'' shirt; and a lone image of Wemberly clutching her doll as she sits in the corner of a page, looking like a minnow in a bubbling tank of questions and question marks. With his characteristic humor, tight prose and vibrant images, Henkes takes Wemberly on a journey that allows her to confront her fears, showing children that it's all right to worry. And, like Henkes's other characters, Wemberly shows that being human is cause for celebration, even if you're a mouse.</p>
