        <p>Roger Clemens was trying to block out everything around him and focus on the Seattle Mariners tonight, but the information age is a tough place to hide when everybody in the ballpark and the baseball world is talking about you.</p>
        <p>Clemens, the Yankee right-hander, saw all the zeroes on a television screen in the clubhouse after the fifth inning tonight and realized he had a no-hitter going. Clemens heard radio broadcasters debating whether he purposely threw at Alex Rodriguez, the way many thought he had thrown at the Mets' Mike Piazza in July. He probably knew coming into the game that he had a reputation for failure in the postseason.</p>
        <p>But Clemens ignored all that and, at 38, produced one of the greatest performances in playoff history, allowing one hit to the Seattle Mariners and striking out 15 in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>With a 5-0 victory tonight, the Yankees took a three-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven-game series and can clinch their third consecutive World Series berth as soon as Sunday afternoon, when Denny Neagle faces Seattle's Freddy Garcia in Game 5.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter and David Justice hit homers to account for the Yankees' runs.</p>
        <p>Al Martin had Seattle's only hit, a line-drive double that tipped off the glove of first baseman Tino Martinez leading off the seventh inning. ''It reminded me of Bob Gibson, the way he went out and hitched up his belt and went after hitters,'' Yankee Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>Clemens's one-hitter was the first in League Championship Series history. He struck out at least one batter in every inning and tied the League Championship Series record for strikeouts in a single nine-inning game, set in 1997 by the Florida Marlins' Livan Hernandez, the younger brother of Clemens's teammate Orlando Hernandez. Gibson, of the St. Louis Cardinals, set the record for most strikeouts in a postseason game when he struck out 17 Detroit Tigers in a World Series game in 1968.</p>
        <p>''I feel real fortunate that I've been able to continue at this stage of my career,'' Clemens said, ''to go out there and be a part of a great deal of excitement and have a chance to light it up. Sometimes you get beat, but tonight was special.''</p>
        <p>Clemens implicitly announces his intentions in the very first inning. If he has average stuff, for example, his first fastball is often a two-seamer about 91 to 92 miles an hour, depending on how his legs feel, how loose he is. Tonight his first pitch was 96 m.p.h., and the message could not have been clearer if he had hung a 100-foot neon sign from the Space Needle: he felt extraordinary, a fact quickly confirmed when he struck out the first two batters.</p>
        <p>But the Mariners quickly received the second part of Clemens's message, in code. Rodriguez came to bat with two out in the first inning and Clemens hurled a 97 m.p.h. fastball in the vicinity of the batter's jaw. Rodriguez fell backward, spinning and staring out at Clemens, then at the Yankees' dugout, and then at Clemens again.</p>
        <p>Clemens threw his next pitch in almost the exact same spot, making Rodriguez bend back again. It was Clemens's most overt brushback -- two fastballs high and inside, thrown to the opposing team's best player -- since he beaned Piazza on July 8.</p>
        <p>The Mariners were incensed, Manager Lou Piniella turning and uttering obscenities to others in the Seattle dugout, Rodriguez staring at Clemens after he reached first base on a walk. ''It's puzzling how that can happen when a guy has such good control,'' Rodriguez said later, after initially declining to comment several times. ''He never misses up and away. He always misses up and in. It's some stuff I'm angry about, but I'll get over it.''</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada, Clemens's catcher, batted with one out in the top of the second inning, and Paul Abbott, the Seattle starter, whipped a fastball over his head. Piniella rose off the Seattle bench and screamed in the direction of the Yankees' bench, to resolve any confusion Posada might have had over Abbott's intentions. ''If he wants to throw at our guys, we'll throw at his guys, period,'' Piniella said.</p>
        <p>Clemens said: ''I've got no comment on that. I was trying to pitch A-Rod inside.''</p>
        <p>Before Clemens began warming up for the bottom of the second, Umpire John Hirschbeck went to the mound, stood face to face with the pitcher and addressed him, presumably playing the role of peacekeeper, telling Clemens that it might be a good idea if he did not respond to what Abbott had done.</p>
        <p>But Clemens had already served his purpose, anyway, and now, in the second inning, he began finding his rhythm, mixing in more split-fingered fastballs, twice finishing off hitters with 98 m.p.h. fastballs.</p>
        <p>The conditions were perfect for him. Clemens likes to pitch in cool temperatures and it was 56 degrees. Clemens loves the mound here, the hardness of it, the way the surface does not erode during the course of a game; the base is built of clay from the Pacific Northwest, the top six inches of a mud composition called Gumbo, shipped from Mississippi.</p>
        <p>Clemens retired the Mariners in order in the second inning, and the third. After there was one out in the fourth, Rodriguez fanned on a two-seam fastball, and Edgar Martinez grounded to shortstop.</p>
        <p>Clemens has never thrown a no-hitter in his career, but he had easily dispatched a Mariners lineup that had performed so miserably in the first three games of this series that Piniella replaced four of the nine starters before this game. Clemens walked into the clubhouse, and while he was changing his T-shirt, he noticed the line score on the television and realized he had a no-hitter. ''He had no-hit stuff,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>Abbott was shutting out the Yankees, as well, but he had not pitched in nine days and was expected to last six innings, at the most. Some of his fastballs began to sail at the outset of the fifth, a sign of weariness, and with two out, Scott Brosius poked a single through the right side of the infield, Chuck Knoblauch walked and Jeter slammed a three-run homer.</p>
        <p>''It was like Roger put the hammer down after that,'' said Jose Canseco, Clemens's longtime teammate.</p>
        <p>Clemens was armed with a sizeable lead and began establishing complete command of his breaking pitches, mixing his splitters and sliders. There were three weak outs in the fifth, a grounder to the pitcher, a strikeout and a popout to third, the last pitch of the inning clocking in at 98 m.p.h. Clemens had retired 13 consecutive batters and needed 12 more for a no-hitter.</p>
        <p>Clemens's first pitch to David Bell in the sixth inning registered at 99 m.p.h.; at the end of a 10-pitch at-bat, Bell popped out weakly to second. Clemens then cut down Dan Wilson and Stan Javier on strikes.</p>
        <p>Now, in the seventh, Clemens threw a fastball high, then tried a sinker down and in. Martin pulled a liner down the first-base line, and Clemens heard the ball tick off the top of Tino Martinez's outstretched glove and down into the right-field corner for a double. The no-hitter was over. ''I couldn't catch it,'' Martinez said later. ''It's not like I could've done something differently and caught it.''</p>
        <p>Clemens had to refocus: Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez were due to bat, and between them they had the potential of propelling Seattle back into the game. Clemens's pitch count had exceeded 100, and with two relievers warming up in the Yankees' bullpen, he might have sensed he was close to being relieved. Bearing down, he struck out Rodriguez swinging and Martinez looking.</p>
        <p>John Olerud walked, but Clemens zipped a fastball over the outside corner to fan Mike Cameron, and pumped his right fist. He struck out two more in the eighth and two more in the ninth, and when the game was over, Torre held his right hand on the side of Clemens's head. ''That was special, Roger,'' he said, and smiled. ''That was absolutely dominant.''</p>
