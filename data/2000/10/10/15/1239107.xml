      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Since Branford Marsalis made his recording debut in 1984 with ''Scenes in the City,'' he has built a reputation as one of the best and most versatile jazz saxophonists playing today. He has ventured into the rock 'n' roll and pop arena playing with the Grateful Dead, Bruce Hornsby and Sting. Ten years after his debut, he broke new ground combining jazz and hip-hop in ''Buckshot LeFonque.''</p>
        <p>In his latest recording, ''Contemporary Jazz'' on Columbia Records, he teams up with Jeff (Tain) Wattson on drums, Eric Revis on bass and Joey Calderazzo on piano to make some of his best basic jazz to date.</p>
