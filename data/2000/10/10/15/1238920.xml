        <p>BEFORE writing down my impressions of Panevino Ristorante, I asked the chef, Anthony Guglielmelli, how he might describe the place if he were talking about it to a friend. I was sure he'd boast about the pair of boccie courts out back or the vibrant drawings of food that add a personal touch to the cheery dining room. I thought he would at least touch on the herb garden or the wood-burning pizza oven.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Guglielmelli chose to depict Panevino using the most basic Italian culinary touchstone as his example: the pizza dough. He said that Panevino's owner, Restaurant Associates, carefully researched Italian cuisine before its opening in 1988 (there are two other Panevinos, in Manhattan and in Washington, D.C., similar but not identical). The resulting menu items are based on those of various regions of Italy, and the ingredients used either match or mimic the ingredients found in these regions. ''We sent chefs to Italy to gauge what flour we should use for our pizza dough,'' Mr. Guglielmelli said. ''The flour and water used in Naples won them over. So we import our flour from there and use spring water that resembles the nature of the water in Naples.''</p>

        <p>BEFORE writing down my impressions of Panevino Ristorante, I asked the chef, Anthony Guglielmelli, how he might describe the place if he were talking about it to a friend.

        <p>Instead, Mr. Guglielmelli chose to depict Panevino using the most basic Italian culinary touchstone as his example: the pizza dough. He said that Panevino's owner, Restaurant Associates, carefully researched Italian cuisine before its opening in 1988 (there are two other Panevinos, in Manhattan and in Washington, D.C., similar but not identical). The resulting menu items are based on those of various regions of Italy, and the ingredients used either match or mimic the ingredients found in these regions. ''We sent chefs to Italy to gauge what flour we should use for our pizza dough,'' Mr. Guglielmelli said. ''The flour and water used in Naples won them over. So we import our flour from there and use spring water that resembles the nature of the water in Naples.''</p>
        <p>It's hard to find something that's not close to Italy at the casual Panevino, with the exception of the surrounding countryside, dotted with muffler repair shops, fast-food outlets and big-box stores rather than red-roofed villas and olive groves.  Large groups and families fill most of the tables, whose cushions remind me of those tied to mismatched chairs in a rural farmhouse. Several folks perch at the bar, while others sip cocktails in the courtyard or carry them out to the boccie tournament. Steaming pizzas, sandwiches and bruschetta are cooked in the  wood-fueled pizza oven, while salads loaded with shrimp, tomatoes and emerald greens emerge from the swinging kitchen door.</p>
        <p>One way to start is with the gamberetti Panevino, sauteed shrimp and calamari loosely arranged in a Sicilian sauce of lemon, basil, garlic, parsley and red pepper flakes, also available as a main course. Angus steak carpaccio at Panevino comes either in the classic Venetian preparation -- topped with arugula and Parmesan shavings -- or in a mustard brandy sauce. Insalata Panevino arrived as a healthy stack of sliced and raw artichokes, celery root, fennel, celery, Parmesan and button mushrooms, all lightly seasoned with lemon juice and olive oil.  Insalata tropicale is a hearty chopped salad of shrimp, avocado, hearts of palm, mixed greens, arugula and Parmesan, served with the same vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Even without Mr. Guglielmelli's explanation, you can learn from the menu about the durum wheat flour grown and milled in Italy, the vine-ripened plum tomatoes and the chunks of freshly made fior di latte cheese on Panevino's menu. One bite and I understood why such ingredients and the oven in which they were baked can make a difference. The margherita (Mr. Guglielmelli's favorite) is a combination of Panevino's wonderful dough, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil, and it's fabulous. Maybe the Sbandata will still be on the menu when you visit, as this combination of fontina, provolone, mozzarella, Parmesan and pecorino cheese, topped with a few rosemary sprigs and some pear-shaped yellow cherry tomatoes might just be the best white pizza out there. It's a pizza that could persuade anyone to abandon tomato sauce for good.</p>
        <p>Another treat from the pizza oven is the pagnotelle sandwich, offered at lunch. It seems to be a cross between a calzone and a focaccia sandwich,  baked until it puffs up around a hollow center (as a pita bread might), then stuffed with a variety of fillings and baked once more until the ingredients inside reach the same temperature as the crust.</p>
        <p>The pastas and main courses are a bit less stellar. The dough and the filling in the ravioli of the day, both made in-house, can be slightly chewy. The sun-dried tomato version came with a fresh tomato sauce; the dish was too much of a good thing, even in peak tomato season. Minigonne con pollo e funghi, or miniskirt pasta with chicken and mushrooms, is not as glamorous as it sounds. It is really just a bowl of cut-up rigatonis in a demi-glace sauce, a sauce I might reserve for a full breast of chicken rather than just a few bites. The veal and sole entrees were surprisingly greasy after such a healthy beginning. While the veal included a miniature salad of arugula and tomato on top, the sole's ''ragout'' of asparagus, tomato, pine nuts and lemon was not only overcooked but was also too assertive for such a delicate fish.</p>
        <p>Of all the wonderful desserts, my favorite was the cannoli, spilling with sweet ricotta and studded with candied orange rind. While Mr. Guglielmelli could have prepared his own authentic version, he chose to buy the components from Ferrara's Pastry in Manhattan's Little Italy, which does a equally fine job of mimicking the real thing. Mr. Guglielmelli's own tiramisu is so popular that it may never come off the menu. Torta di mascarpone is a straightforward creation as well, with Italian mascarpone replacing cream cheese in the popular American cheesecake. I found its tangy flavor enticing, and even better when swallowed with a spoonful of gelato or sorbet.</p>
        <p>I'd recommend playing a round of boccie before packing the family into the van. Or at least take a minute to gaze at the original art commissioned not only in New York and Italy but also England, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. These interpretations of the basic theme of fruit, vegetables, food and wine are honest and creative, and apply perfectly to Panevino.</p>
