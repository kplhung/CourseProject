        <p>ON a recent trip to Vienna there was a fall bite in the air. Although it was still warm enough to have cake and coffee at a sidewalk cafe, the leaves were turning, and signs of autumn were evident on every menu. In addition to the year-round dumplings, strudels, schnitzels and sacher tortes, there was an abundance of wild mushrooms, pumpkins, venison and boar.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the use of pumpkin has flourished recently since the renaissance of pumpkin-seed-oil production in Austria. The oil, with its warmly nutty flavor, was a revelation.</p>
        <p>Austrian wines are another revelation. In the aftermath of the wine scandal in 1985, when it was learned that diethylene glycol,  automobile antifreeze, was added to some mass-produced wines to add body, laws were stiffened and family wineries gained in popularity. Wine lists tend to be expensive, but every restaurant I visited had not only a wealth of appetizing selections but also a goodly number of delicious wines by the glass, from sleek Gruner Veltliners and mellow Morillons (chardonnay) to deliciously fruity reds from grapes like blaufrankisch and blauburgunder (pinot noir).</p>
        <p>Steirereck</p>
        <p>Widely considered Austria's leading restaurant, Steirereck, near the Danube Canal, is the near inevitable choice for celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, as well as for entertaining visitors. Its several dining rooms -- a pleasing hodgepodge of wooden beams, stone columns, vaulted ceilings, plush carpets and tapestries of bucolic bacchanals -- reek of prosperity. Service follows suit, as does the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Don't expect culinary fireworks. What Steirereck does, and does very well, is to apply French techniques and niceties (like friandises) to Austrian ingredients, never, however, losing its Austrian roots. You know you're in Vienna, starting with the super pumpkin-seed bread that's part of a vast selection of loaves wheeled out in a cart.</p>
        <p>At dinner, two menus are proposed: five courses for $60 and four at $53, at 15.6 schillings to the dollar. You can pick and choose, ordering a la carte, as we did, but you end up paying as much, if not more.</p>
        <p>My friend Joyce and I started with French-toasted brioche interspersed with winey, intensely flavored foie gras, all resting on chopped mango, a somewhat lumbering though lipsmacking dish. Slices of venison, layered over mashed potatoes seasoned with truffle oil and garnished with truffle shavings was a beautiful combination, bracingly accented by red currant sauce.</p>
        <p>Delicate steaks of pike-perch came with state-of-the-art potato latkes. We didn't taste much garlic in the garlic sauce but the fish was good enough to stand on its own. Pigeon, the size of a large quail, was perfectly roasted and served with a pungent elderberry sauce and a delectable mix of sauteed mushrooms and bacon. An individual walnut souffle, hot from the oven, came with ice cream too redolent of cinnamon and clove for me; Joyce, however, found the pairing agreeable.</p>
        <p>Steirereck has a vast wine cellar and a very good list. The menus propose a different wine with each dish. You're free to mix and match, which is what we did, selecting glasses of a '98 Gruner Veltliner Ried Loibner Steinertal from Alzinger, an elegant white with flavors of apples and minerals, and a '98 Blauerzweigelt Reserve from Sepp Moser, a streamlined red with lovely cherry flavors. (Wines cost $6 to $7.70 a glass.)</p>
        <p>Altwienerhof</p>
        <p>Altwienerhof is a bastion of old-fashioned classic French cooking. The chef, Rudolf Kellner, a veteran of cruise ships and kitchens in Paris, London and Switzerland, is an unabashed Escoffier-phile. And if some preparations seem tired -- deer pate and whale (yes, whale) terrine, for example -- most of what comes out of Mr. Kellner's kitchen is first-rate, a delicious trip down memory lane.</p>
        <p>His pumpkin cream soup, garnished with pumpkin seeds and a swirl of pumpkin seed oil, is as soothing as it is masterful. Filets of Danube catfish are beautifully fried, presented on a gently piquant puree of horseradish and vegetables. The fish is excellent and served piping hot. Rabbit filet, on an exquisite eiswein (a rare sweet wine) sauce, could not have been better: rarely have I tasted white meat as juicy and flavorful.</p>
        <p>The dessert trolley strikes many Proustian chords; the intense Escoffier Valrhona chocolate mousse cake, for example, would surely have pleased its namesake.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the three dining rooms are a bit old-world stodgy.We found the small winter garden too cluttered and bright, and preferred the salon with its sober tapestries and wood paneling. Our service ranged from considerate (nicely dividing every dish so we ended up with our own tasting menu) to negligent (empty aperitif glasses left on the table).</p>
        <p>The international wine list, however, was stellar, though with prices to match. We were thrilled with a rich, oak-and-berry-flavored Austrian red, the '97 Cuvee Alter Weingarten Krutzler ($38). Another revelation was Waldheidelbeere (blueberry) eau de vie from Hochmair ($10).</p>
        <p>Schnattl</p>
        <p>This is the favorite restaurant of Vienna's foodies. The chef and owner, Willy Schnattl, they say, is a mad genius, a monkish food fanatic who reinvents Austrian cooking. That Mr. Schnattl is monomaniacal when it comes to food is evident from the decor, which is clearly an afterthought: his small restaurant in a residential neighborhood is a no-frills affair -- albeit a comfortable one, with crisp linen, good wine glasses and classic Viennese wainscoting painted an unconventional pea green.</p>
        <p>Attention is paid to wine, though. The list is full of gems from small producers, like the 1997 Blaufrankisch Ried Oberer Wald from Ernst Triebaumer ($36), a gorgeous, structured red that seemed a cross of Burgundy and Rhone. Such personalized wines are at home at Schnattl, where the cooking is definitely one man's vision: authentic, skillful and original.</p>
        <p>Saumeise, for example, is a funky wurstlike patty of minced, seasoned pork sliced into paper-thin rounds, pan fried and served with a horseradish dressing over a bed of arugula, chanterelles and strips of long white radish. What is normally a heavy, fatty dish is turned into something fresh, light and intriguing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schnattl's pickled tongue parfait is fascinating, based on the best beef tongue I have ever eaten (its flavor was as rich as that of pastrami). A terrine of foie gras and mousse of tongue wrapped in strips of tongue, it was nuanced and silky and came with a slice of toasted corn brioche so good I would have liked it for breakfast. Haunch of baby deer was equally satisfying: tender, rosy meat on a gloriously deep meat glaze, garnished with marinated fresh almonds and exemplary potato dumplings.</p>
        <p>But pumpkin ricotta quenelles -- three dumplings on a hill of pumpkin balls, spinach and chanterelles -- disappointed. It just didn't add up. Desserts, too, were anticlimactic; the best, an egg-liquor pudding, was a pleasant flan recalling the French staple oeufs au lait.</p>
        <p>Despite the occasional nonstarter, however, it's fun to see what Mr. Schnattl comes up with, to taste how he's going to translate Ur-Austria into something entirely his own.</p>
        <p>Vikerl's Lokal</p>
        <p>You can't get more local than this: a couple of well-polished, cozy rooms on a tiny, obscure side street run by a young couple, Adi and Bettina Bittermann. You can't get nicer either: Mrs. Bittermann, for example, spent at least 15 minutes at peak time on a busy Saturday night painstakingly translating every item on the menu for two off-the-street Americans, frequently looking up difficult terms in a four-language gastronomic lexicon.</p>
        <p>And it's hard to find more appealing food. A single taste of Adi Bittermann's smoky chanterelle cream -- to spread on his excellent hot red pepper or pumpernickel bread -- shows that someone is thinking in the kitchen. Much like Mr. Schnattl, Mr. Bittermann takes Austrian foodstuffs as a source of inspiration. Every dish is beautifully presented, fresh, clear and well-conceived. Also delicious.</p>
        <p>Pairing goat cheese and bacon is traditional in Austria. Mr. Bittermann uses the goat cheese to make a fritter base, which he fills with chopped bacon, a light, savory pleasure, nicely accompanied by tomatoes dressed in a gentle curry sauce. Succulent duck meat appears not in a strudel but as the filling for delectable, light, deep-fried wrappers posed on a bed of crunchy wild mushrooms and sprouts of cress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bittermann's long-simmered pork cheeks are sensational; they practically melt in the mouth. The homemade ravioli served alongside were a bit chewy, however.</p>
        <p>No missteps with the calf's liver, though. Cut in thick slabs, it was perfectly cooked. Surely among the best I've eaten, it was served on a layer of tripe sliced into teeny strips and cooked into a kind of confit with strips of ginger. It was so scrumptious that Joyce, who normally hates tripe, cleaned the plate. And it's got to be the sign of something good when the simple potatoes in a parsley cream sauce, which came with it, are also a minor gustatory masterpiece.</p>
        <p>With very little arm twisting, our waiter talked us into the dessert assortment, a good choice. True, the orange-pineapple tiramisu didn't work, but everything else was stellar -- from a creamy fresh cheese with intense berry coulis; to the fresh cheese dumpling, a fritter with the flavor of a good blintz; to the warm, dense chocolate-walnut cake; and the lip-smacking chocolate mousse torte.</p>
        <p>From the well-considered wine list, we started with a rich white, the '99 Rotgipfler Grand Select from Thiel ($3 a glass) and moved on to the '97 Pinot Noir Siglos from Weingut Gesellmann, an utterly delicious, rather Burgundian red ($26 a bottle).</p>
        <p>Meinl am Graben</p>
        <p>The Fauchon of Vienna, two floors of epicurean excess, has a handful of attractive places to eat: a salad bar, a caviar-smoked fish-vodka bar, stools at its cheese counter and tables in the pastry section. Its most ambitious dining experience, however, is a full-fledged restaurant in a second-floor wing that opened last December.</p>
        <p>A spare, handsome room, its huge bay windows look out on the Graben, the busy pedestrian throroughfare. At lunch, it seems very much the place to be in New Vienna, recalling nothing so much as the Costes enterprises in Paris -- from the buzz to the international menu, complete with a variety of risottos, hamburger mit fries and Caesar salads.</p>
        <p>Christian Petz left the kitchens of the Palais Schwarzenberg to direct the ovens here. Amid the eclectic dishes, he always includes two classics from the Austrian table. When I visited, the irresistible choice was tafelspitz. A sort of Austrian brisket, this was a sturdy, grandmotherly presentation of a large slab of boiled rump of Styrian beef served, as tradition requires, with apple sauce blended with horseradish, creamed spinach and roasted potatoes that tasted like hash browns.</p>
        <p>The daily $19 menu consisted of a delicate fish terrine (about what you'd expect from a high-class caterer), tender chunks of veal with swiss chard and a gratin of potatoes and celeriac, followed by a cappuccino parfait with Bailey's Irish Cream -- something of an unappealing mush of schlag and coffee ice cream. Much better was warm chocolate pudding, a gooey flourless chocolate cake with a snappy collar made of white chocolate and a deeply chocolate sauce.</p>
        <p>You can also select your dessert from the pastry counter adjacent to the restaurant. Not a bad idea, as everything that comes from the shop seems to be top notch, from the great baguettes to the short but effective wine list. The wines range from South Africa to California to gems from Austria like the '99 Gruner Veltliner Loibner Klostersatz from F. X. Pichler ($21), a rich, regal white.</p>
        <p>Steirerstockl</p>
        <p>If you know you're going to be in Vienna on a Sunday, reserve for lunch at this gemutlich restaurant on the edge of the Vienna woods. If it's sunny, try for a picnic table under the trees; if not, the dining room, with its wood banquettes and embroidered linen tablecloths is a cozy alternative.</p>
        <p>Joyce, two other American expats, Victoria and Peter, who love this place, and I started with tangy fresh goat cheese wrapped and roasted in thick bacon, a hearty and flavorful dish. Fresh noodles tossed with pumpkin and pumpkin seeds was pleasant, nothing more. Similarly, roast boar underwhelmed, tasting a bit like cafeteria fare.</p>
        <p>Strudel stuffed with chanterelles, however, was delectable, with its soft, woodsy mushroom flavor. And the boar schnitzel -- tender, juicy meat encased in the most delicious blend of bread crumbs, herbs and chopped nuts, then fried to perfection -- is an absolute must. What was billed as pumpkin kugelhopf was a freshly baked individual nut cake, a satisfyingly homey dessert accompanied by whipped cream and sour cherries.</p>
        <p>Service couldn't be nicer -- our waiter gamely translated all the offerings -- and the wine list was short but excellent. Apricot eau de vie from the Goach family, the restaurant's owners, was a deliciously bracing cap to a leisurely Sunday lunch.</p>
        <p>Bill of fare</p>
        <p>Many Viennese restaurants add cover charges of $1.25 to $4 a person to the bill. But it is also customary to tip up to 10 percent, which is considered generous. Prices are based on a meal for two with a bottle of wine but no tip. Smoking is allowed in all these restaurants, and unless specified, they accept all major credit cards.</p>

        <p>For casual dining, with coffee or wine</p>
        <p>There are at least three typically Viennese modes of casual eating: the cafe, the heuriger (wine tavern) and the stand-up sandwicherie.</p>
        <p>The cafes of Vienna are many, varied and often legendary (replete with associations with Mozart, Trotsky and Freud). And every citizen of Vienna has a favorite -- even if it's on the well-worn tourist track.</p>
        <p>While I didn't unearth the cafe of my dreams, I discovered a number to propose:</p>
        <p>Demel, founded in 1786, with its sugar-plum-fairy decor, all gilt and chandeliers and marble and mirrors -- not to mention what many consider the best pastry in town (the sacher torte recalled a fine Maida Heatter recipe); the dark and smoky Cafe Hawelka, whose owners, the Hawelka family, are living legends, and whose sheet cakes, moist with fruit, are as homey as can be; and the Palmenhaus, actually an up-to-date restaurant that recently opened in the soaring greenhouse in the Burggarten, the splendidly green park near the Kunsthistorisches Museum (which also has a nice cafe).</p>
        <p>Vienna's vineyards start within the city limits, giving birth to heurigen, wine taverns, in which the wine of the house is served with down-home Austrian fare. The post-card-ready streets of Grinzing, in the hills north of the city, are lined with heurigen -- identified by pine branches over the doors. But we took the No. 31 tram to Stammersdorf, on the other side of the Danube, to the heuriger of Vienna's best vintner, Wieninger.</p>
        <p>Like most heurigen, Wieninger is set in a brightly painted stucco house with rustic knotty-pine-paneled dining rooms, and a leafy, flower-filled courtyard with picnic tables and benches. Wine is sold by the pitcher, glass or bottle.</p>
        <p>We chose a bottle of crisp, mineral '98 Gruner Veltliner Herrenholz ($10.25), then repaired to the counter where food is displayed. An angelic server struggled through English explanations for all the dishes, and as we selected our food, she cut and weighed and tabulated prices for strudel stuffed with pumpkin, slabs of Austrian meatloaf (highly seasoned with mace, caraway and onions), chanterelle salad, fava beans in pumpkin seed oil, and a crispy slaw dressed with white vinegar and caraway seeds.</p>
        <p>I skipped dessert in favor of walnuts I'd knocked down from the tree above me while a foursome at the next table, in full Tyrolean regalia, toasted my efforts with glasses of sturm, the new still-fermenting wine.</p>
        <p>A variety of open-faced sandwiches, selected from the counter, and eaten standing up, is a popular way to lunch in Vienna, one that had eluded me until I happened on Urbanek, a minuscule family-run deli in the appropriately named Naschmarket, Vienna's mouthwatering open-air market that is open every day except Sunday. The scene: A counter crammed with cold cuts, shelves groaning with cheese or lined with wines from Austria and Italy, hams hanging from hooks, and clients squeezed inside or clustered outside, tasting glasses of good wines (I particularly liked the '99 Gruner Veltliner Ried Rafasetzen from Ludwig Neumayer for $10) or of sturm, accompanied by hefty sandwiches or plates of peppery Austrian pastrami and Bergkase, a strong, nutty mountain cheese.</p>
        <p>''This place is as much of an Austrian institution as Mozart,'' an enthusiastic regular told me. ''Everyone comes here, chefs, actors, prime ministers.'' Indeed, I was very reluctant to leave.</p>
