        <p>Veeco Announces Resignation of President</p>
        <p>The president and chief executive officer of Veeco Instruments Inc. (Nasdaq: VECO) , Christine B. Whitman, resigned after the Plainview company reported  third quarter results lower than expected. She also gave up her position on the board but will continue as a consultant. Edward H. Braun, chairman of the board, will take over the chief executive's position and continue as president.</p>
        <p>Veeco's anticipated sales for the third quarter were approximately $93 million, falling below expectations of $104 million. Earnings per share were announced as below 22 cents, approximately half for the same period last year. This came despite record orders for the quarter of approximately $175 million.</p>
        <p>The company blamed lower sales and earnings on Veeco's acquisition of CVC, a competitor. The problem, they said, was delayed orders and shipments from data storage and specialty semiconductor customers. There were also problems with the company's ion beam deposition  operations, which have been moved from Virginia to the company's headquarters in Plainview.</p>
        <p>Veeco manufactures process equipment and metrology tools for the optical telecommunications, data storage, semiconductor and research markets.</p>
