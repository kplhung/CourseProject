        <p>IT was with great fanfare 20 months ago that the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, announced a new county policy to confiscate the vehicles of people charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol. Mr. Gulotta touted the crackdown as a boon for public safety and spun visions of a windfall from the resale of seized cars.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, the number of D.W.I.-related accidents has declined in Nassau. But there's nothing to prevent the accused from getting back behind the wheel of a different car after one too many, and critics say the program has not speeded the process of getting drunk drivers off the road.</p>
        <p>And with more than 1,000 vehicles seized, the first batch of 48 went on the auction block only last month. They fetched a grand total of $30,000, while the cost of administering the program has ballooned to about $850,000.</p>
        <p>Detective work on the program has cost about $250,000, and roughly $120,000 worth of police officers' time has been spent serving the approximately 1,000 summonses and complaints associated with the program.</p>
        <p>Additional money was spent for the storage and towing of cars that were seized and not returned to a second party owner. The police department estimated that towing and storage for the cars that were not returned was approximately $315,000. (For cars that were returned, the owners had to pay for storage and towing.)</p>
        <p>An additional $125,000 went to a private security firm hired to patrol the storage area, which is at Cedar Creek Park. Renovating the storage lot cost about $40,000 more.</p>
        <p>The police department is taking steps to reduce administrative costs. A civilian aide was hired in May to handle some of the paperwork previously processed by detectives, and the aide's $20,000 salary is only a fifth of that of the average detective. A second civilian is scheduled to be hired, and Detective Lt. Michael Fleming, commander of the Asset Forfeiture Bureau, said detectives would eventually investigate ''only the difficult cases.'' And in June, a private company was hired to serve summonses for only $40 per delivery.</p>
        <p>Roger Bogsted, the county coordinator for its stop-D.W.I. program, said that ''the object of the program was never to make money, it was to save lives and reduce crashes.''</p>
        <p>Statistics provided by the Nassau County Traffic Safety Board show that the number of accidents classified as D.W.I.-related have in fact declined. For the two 12-month periods before the vehicle-seizure policy went into effect in February 1999, the county logged 525 and 524 D.W.I.-related accidents. In the first 12 months since the program began, that figure dropped to 350.</p>
        <p>The number of D.W.I. arrests has also declined, though there's speculation that the shift partly reflects police officers' aversion to the extra paperwork required for an arrest involving a vehicle forfeiture. Still, the statistics show 4,857 and 4,256 D.W.I. arrests in the two 12-month periods before the program and 2,857 in the 12 months since it began.</p>
        <p>But D.W.I.-related fatalities have shown virtually no change, rising from 23 to 26 before the program went into effect and declining only to 24 in the year after.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, the program was plagued with problems. Under orders to impound every vehicle in a D.W.I. arrest, even though a seized car cannot be forfeited unless it is registered to the person arrested, the number of impounded vehicles grew to over 3,000 and storage became a logistical nightmare.</p>
        <p>''The biggest mistake we made at the beginning was taking cars that belonged to innocent people,'' Lt. Fleming said.. ''We weren't going to successfully litigate those cars anyway, and all it managed to do was overburden our resources.''</p>
        <p>Lt. Fleming said that of the cars seized -- 3,059 as of Sept. 20 -- 2,005, or nearly two-thirds, have been returned. He said that ''a few'' were returned after investigators determined that the claimants faced a medical hardship because of the loss of their cars, and a larger but undetermined number because the vehicles had liens on them. But the vast majority, he said, were returned because they weren't owned by the people who were driving them when they were arrested.</p>
        <p>He said that in July, the police department ''authorized desk officers to conduct an evaluation of the vehicles and make a determination whether to impound it or not.</p>
        <p>''Basically, what they would look at is whether or not the vehicle is owned by an innocent party,'' he said. ''And if that is the case, the car is not impounded. In hindsight, we've learned that innocent owners don't forfeit their cars, so why take them in the first place?''</p>
        <p>To date, the County Attorney's office has not settled any case in which a confiscation was challenged. Representatives from that office refused to comment, but Mr. Bogsted said, ''I think we are on board as far as civil proceedings.</p>
        <p>''It is a very litigious process with regards to delays and a lot of defense attorneys are trying to see if they can keep the cars,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone would deny it has been a logistical nightmare in that we have had to find storage for so many cars. But then again, we don't know how many lives we have saved.''</p>
        <p>Calling the policy a ''terrible program that doesn't resolve the problem,'' Barbara Bernstein, executive director of the Nassau County chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said that the initiative ''doesn't prevent someone from driving drunk again.''</p>
        <p>She said that her group is trying to gain support for a Breathalyzer device that would be put into the cars of those with a first conviction for D.W.I. A driver would have to blow into the device periodically, and a high alcohol reading would set off a car alarm that would sound until the ignition was turned off.</p>
        <p>''This would be put in at their own expense,'' she explained. ''With the county program, the person doesn't lose their ability to drive, they just lose that car.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bernstein acknowledged that a drunk driver's passenger could defeat the system, but added, ''Any sane, sober person who gets into a car with someone drunk and does that may be sober but not sane.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bogsted said the county would consider including a Breathalyzer device in the program.</p>
        <p>''It is an evolving program and we continue to make changes in the program as long as we don't lessen the impact, which has always been to keep drunk drivers off the road,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lt. Fleming said that despite its problems, the vehicle confiscation program is a success. ''In spite of the difficulties involved in administering this program, I truly believe it has had an impact on the safety of our community,'' he said. ''It has scared people enough to think twice about driving drunk.''</p>
