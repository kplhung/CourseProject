        <p>I was impressed by your article about the effect of transportation improvements on real estate values [''Location, Location, Commutation,'' Oct. 1].

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was impressed by your article about the effect of transportation improvements on real estate values [''Location, Location, Commutation,'' Oct. 1]. But as an occasional visitor to eastern Dutchess County I was more than a little startled to find an Amenia town supervisor speculating that ''in 10 or 20 years'' the rail line would be extended beyond its current northern terminus at Wassaic.</p>
        <p>Is the Arlene Iuliano you quote totally ignorant of improvements in her own backyard? The entire rail line north of the Wassaic station has been acquired by New York State and committed to a linear park, the Harlem Valley Rail Trail. Traversing farms, woods and babbling brooks, this paved biking-hiking-jogging and cross-country-skiing trail offers close encounters with wildflowers, wild animals and imposing views of Taconic Ridge, free of traffic, noise, fumes, and other hazards of highway travel.</p>
        <p>The section from Mechanic Street, Amenia, to Middleton is open now; additional sections will open next summer and, by 2002, the trail should stretch from the Wassaic railhead to the many recreational opportunities of Taconic State Park in Copake Falls.</p>
        <p>Already popular with local families and weekend visitors, this unique amenity can only enhance property values for commuters, local families and weekenders alike. True, there are some local residents (including, apparently, Ms. Iuliano) who oppose this development. But this conflict, a very hot issue locally, surely deserves more from The Times than a brief aside from a clearly self-interested source.</p>
