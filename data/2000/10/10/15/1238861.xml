        <p>WHEN Jean Coaxum first moved into Fiske Cottage in 1994, she had trouble sleeping. After 10 years in prison, she missed the sound of doors slamming, keys rattling, toilets flushing and people screaming. It was too peaceful.</p>
        <p>Fiske Cottage is the super honor dorm at the Bedford Hills Correctional Center for women, and Ms. Coaxum is one of 26 residents.</p>
        <p>Getting into Fiske Cottage requires a clean disciplinary record, a willingness to work and a successful record of volunteering to help other inmates, First Deputy Superintendent Susan Schultz said. The nature of the prisoners' crimes or length of sentence doesn't matter. The majority of the residents are serving life sentences, many of them for murder.</p>
        <p>Honor dorms like Fiske Cottage provide a major incentive for prisoners to behave, Ms. Schultz said. But it is harder to get in than ever because of strong public sentiment against parole. ''Because most of the women are long termers, movement out of Fiske is slow,'' Ms. Schultz said. ''Women that are in for violent crimes are not prime candidates for parole.''</p>
        <p>Fiske has recently experienced the most turnover in many years, said Marie Noonan, a senior counselor at the prison. Three women were paroled or granted clemency in the last year and a half, making room for three new honor inmates. Fiske Cottage was opened in 1982 as a self-governing honor dorm where the inmates developed a system of self-rule, which includes allocating chores, setting quiet hours and resolving  interpersonal conflicts.</p>
        <p>All Fiske residents hold jobs in different areas of the prison, ranging from teaching inmates to working as nurse's aides in the prison psychiatric hospital. A number of Fiske residents have developed their own programs to help younger inmates, Ms. Noonan said.</p>
        <p>The building was built as a hunting lodge, and was formerly used as the disciplinary housing unit for the Westfield State Reformatory for Women, a prison farm that predated the Bedford Hills name.</p>
        <p>Fiske Cottage bears almost no resemblance to traditional cellblocks at Bedford Hills or any other prison. Its similarity to other prisons is that the women all wear state-issued green uniforms, a guard sits at a desk in the foyer and a fence topped with razor ribbon stands about 50 feet away.</p>
        <p>Fiske is at the top of a hill along the outer perimeter of the prison grounds. It is a three-story brick Colonial with its own gardens, which are tended by the residents.</p>
        <p>The women have their own rooms with a key, and there is a full kitchen and pantry. The common room on the second floor has a vaulted ceiling with exposed beams and a fireplace that doesn't work. While prisoners in the rest of Bedford are counted three times a day, counts at Fiske Cottage are informal, and women must only sign in and out as they go to work assignments and recreation.</p>
        <p>''Fiske is absolutely a better place to live,'' Ms. Schultz said.</p>
        <p>Donna Bell, a Fiske resident for eight years, said: ''My incentive when I was on the regular unit was to get to the honor dorm and then to get to Fiske. The way I got from A to B to C was I had to deal with an anger problem. I got counseling for my anger and for dealing with problems from growing up with domestic violence.''</p>
        <p>To stay in Fiske Cottage, an inmate must maintain a perfect disciplinary record and be fully involved in programs, Ms. Schultz said. Being sent back to the regular housing unit is rare, and neither Ms. Noonan nor Ms. Schultz could recall when that last happened. For many of the inmates living in Fiske, it takes a conscious daily effort to avoid going back to their old ways.</p>
        <p>''Every day is a test, and I could walk out of here today and have a fight and I would be out of here,'' Ms. Bell said. ''I don't want to leave here so I try to work out problems without anger.''</p>
        <p>Since most residents don't violate the rules, their next step after Fiske Cottage should be leaving prison, but many fear that it won't work out that way with fewer paroles being granted.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Pugh, who isn't eligible for parole until 2008, said many of the women are frightened that they will never be paroled because of the policies of the parole board over the last five years. ''Being here doesn't mean that you are eventually going home, it just means that you are doing the right thing and behaving in the facility,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Jean Coaxum has been a model inmate for 14 years, Ms. Schultz said, and she went before the parole board last year. Her hearing was on a Friday, and Ms. Coaxum was denied parole on Monday.</p>
        <p>''I was on a natural high, and you couldn't have told me that I wasn't going home,'' Ms. Coaxum said. ''But it doesn't matter now how good you are in here because they always focus back on the reason why you're here.''</p>
        <p>Despite the diminishing hope for parole, the environment in Fiske is positive and busy. When they are not at work, residents are doing laundry, preparing meals, gardening and reading. Holidays have a remarkably festive air, residents say, even though they are in prison and separated from their families. They prepare a turkey, bake, trim the Christmas tree and exchange gifts.</p>
        <p>''We come together in a crisis because we are like a big family,'' Ms. Bell said. ''Like any family we have problems, but we learn to work out solutions together.''</p>
        <p>Prison officials allow former inmates who have been paroled to visit Fisk, Ms. Noonan said. ''We do it to show that you can get out of prison and be successful.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bell volunteers on weekends distributing videotapes on the regular cellblocks, and she says that it is a constant reminder of what life could be like. She also works in a state warehouse off the prison grounds during the week, which is a different kind of reminder. ''Every time I walk down that hill I hope and dream about the day that it will be my last time,'' Ms. Bell said.</p>
