        <p>'Our idea of luxury is getting more basic the richer we get,'' says my friend who recently became more than a millionaire. She is calling to ask if I know anyone who would like to earn ''high five, low six'' figures a year cooking dinner five days a week for her and her husband. ''All I want is a decent meal on the table when I get home,'' she says. ''And maybe something fancier for dinner parties once in a while.''</p>
        <p>Personal fortunes have always demanded personal service. And over the past quarter-century the vogue in one-on-one attention has shifted from psychiatrist to personal trainer to nutritionist. Today, those flush of fortune -- or seeking to emulate serious wealth -- want a chef to call their own.</p>
        <p>Friends who used to ask for restaurant recommendations now ring up requesting referrals for personal chefs. The United States Personal Chef Association of Rio Rancho, N.M., estimates that only 1,000 American families employed cooks 10 years ago compared with at least 100,000 families today. Cooking schools like Peter Kump in New York have established referral services. Dozens of personal-chef placement services have sprung up, primarily in large cities, though the U.S.P.C.A. fields requests from Bangor, Me., to Bozeman, Mont., says its national director, John Moore.</p>
        <p>''I was out with several well-known chefs, and as we left the restaurant, I heard one rich guy say: 'There goes so and so. He's my chef,''' says Sottha Khunn, the chef of Le Cirque. ''Can you imagine that? Wealthy people used to put chefs in business by backing their restaurants. Now forget about the restaurant -- they just want to own the chef.''</p>
        <p>Al Martino, who owns Chef's International, a placement service in New York, says that former assistants to celebrity chefs like Daniel Boulud, Alice Waters and Wolfgang Puck are in the highest demand. ''The very young and newly rich haven't lived long enough to educate their taste,'' Martino says. ''Employing a brand-name private chef is a way of appearing to have taste.''</p>
        <p>Marc Van Damme, a private chef represented by Martino, says that unlike the old moneyed, among whom simple, traditional menus are most popular, younger titans want inventive dishes dripping in luxury ingredients. Dishes like black-truffle-marinated scallops with roasted prawns, sweet-pea flan with morels and spinach and smoked salmon with blinis and horseradish cream are among his clients' favored appetizers, he says. The most popular main courses include lobster roasted in hazelnut oil with herbed pasta, pan-roasted veal chops with wild mushroom risotto and roasted duck with a vegetable flan.</p>
        <p>Such dishes can be had in the country's finer restaurants. And since the French Revolution, when the former chefs of the fallen aristocracy began opening full-service restaurants, pay-as-you-go public dining rooms have operated not only as social institutions but also as universities of taste. Privatizing chefs could mean that private homes would once again be the place to acquire taste. But I have my doubts.</p>
        <p>Nearly 20 autumns ago, when I was a young chef and only rock 'n' roll stars had private culinary staffs, I cooked for Paul McCartney and his family, who were in New York for a week. Asked to produce a ''seasonal blowout'' for a party of eight musicians, writers and actors, I suggested risotto with white truffles as an appetizer. ''Uh, O.K., but, then, how about macaroni and cheese for the main course,'' came the reply, ''and lemon meringue pie for dessert.''</p>
        <p>Evidently, McCartney's guests possessed only limited tolerance for intimate settings. Even before the lemon meringue pie -- just as I had used designer cheeses to confect the macaroni, I had prepared a lemon curd for the filling -- the host had suggested that the group go out for Champagne.</p>
        <p>The rock star's assistant dashed into the kitchen. ''Where's everybody who is anybody going these days?'' she asked me. ''Quick! The guests need to be seen.''</p>
        <p>Veal Chops With Sage  (Adapted from marc van damme)  4 rib veal chops  6 tablespoons olive oil  2 tablespoons lemon juice  1 bunch fresh sage  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/2 cup dry white wine  1 tablespoon unsalted butter.</p>
        <p>1. Place the veal chops in a large nonreactive pan. Whisk together 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the lemon juice. Stir in 10 coarsely chopped sage leaves. Pour the mixture over the chops, cover and refrigerate for several hours, turning the chops occasionally.</p>
        <p>2. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 200 degrees and place 2 large skillets over high heat. Remove the chops from the marinade and remove and discard any pieces of sage that may be clinging to them. Sprinkle each chop generously with salt and pepper. Divide the remaining 3 tablespoons oil between the pans. When the oil is very hot, place 2 chops in each pan and cook until well browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn and cook until the other side is browned and the chops are cooked to the desired doneness, 4 to 6 minutes, depending on their thickness. Place the chops on a platter, cover with foil and put them in the oven to keep warm while you prepare the sauce.</p>
        <p>3. Pour the grease out of 1 pan and add the wine. Add 5 chopped sage leaves and place over medium heat. Cook, scraping the bottom of the pan, until the wine has reduced to about  1/4 of its original volume. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Transfer the veal chops to 4 plates and pour the sauce over them. Garnish each plate with a few whole sage leaves and serve immediately with potato galettes (see recipe) and pan-grilled scallions with sea salt (see recipe) if desired.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Potato Galettes  (Adapted from marc van damme)  4 large Idaho potatoes  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  8 tablespoons clarified butter.</p>
        <p>1. Peel the potatoes, making sure to keep their round shape, and rinse them under cold water. Using a mandoline, slice one of the potatoes almost paper-thin. (If they are not thin enough, you will have difficulty getting them to adhere to one another; also, do not rinse the slices, as you will remove the starch.) On a work surface, form a circle of overlapping slices about 5 inches in diameter. Continue to make layers of slices, sprinkling them with salt and pepper every couple of layers, until all the slices are used. Make another galette with another potato.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees and place 2 small skillets over medium heat. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter to each. Using a large spatula, carefully transfer 1 galette to each skillet. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. (Lower the heat if they brown too quickly.) Turn and cook the other side until the potatoes are golden brown and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a small sheet pan lined with paper towels and keep warm in the oven.</p>
        <p>3. While the first 2 galettes are cooking, prepare the remaining 2 in the same manner. Serve warm.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Pan-Grilled Scallions With Sea Salt  12 scallions</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a large saucepan half-full of well-salted water to a boil. Trim the scallions and cut off all but 2 inches of their dark green tops. Place them in the boiling water for 1 minute. Immediately drain the scallions and plunge them into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking and set their color. When cooled, drain again and dry between layers of paper towels.</p>
        <p>2. Place a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and oil. When the butter has melted and the pan is very hot, add the scallions. Cook, tossing gently, until the scallions just begin to brown, about 1 minute. Immediately sprinkle them with sea salt and transfer to dinner plates or a small platter and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Tarte Tatin  (Adapted from marc van damme)</p>
        <p>For the pastry dough:  1 cup sifted all-purpose flour  1 large egg</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon salt  1 tablespoon heavy cream  5 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</p>
        <p>For the apples:  3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar  4 to 5 tart apples, like gala or  Granny Smith, peeled, cored and quartered  1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten.</p>
        <p>1. To make the pastry dough, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine all the ingredients for the dough and mix at low speed until just smooth. Gather the dough into a ball (it will be quite soft), flatten to a thick disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</p>
        <p>2. When ready to bake the tart, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and prepare the apples. Use 1 tablespoon of the butter to grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch tart pan with straight sides or a 9-inch cake pan. Sprinkle the bottom with 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Arrange the apples neatly in the pan, rounded side down. Sprinkle them with the remaining sugar and dot with the remaining butter.</p>
        <p>3. On a floured surface, roll the dough out into a disk just slightly larger than the tart pan. Cover the apples with the pastry, tucking the edges of the dough over the apples. Using a pastry brush, brush the surface of the dough with some of the egg yolk.</p>
        <p>4. Bake the tart in the middle of the oven until the dough is very lightly browned and the apples are just tender when poked through the dough with the tip of a paring knife, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. Place a serving plate upside down on top of the tart pan. Using kitchen mitts, grasp the edges of the plate and the pan and quickly invert the pan. Remove the pan. Cut the tart into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
