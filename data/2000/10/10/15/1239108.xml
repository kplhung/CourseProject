Members of the alliance will be showing how they do what they do, in painting, photography, pottery and other areas. The spectrum will be broad -- as Clem Fiori demonstrates woodworking with vintage tools, Madelaine Shellaby and Ruane Miller will be showing how to create and alter digital images. Visitors will get a chance to try some of the techniques.</p>
