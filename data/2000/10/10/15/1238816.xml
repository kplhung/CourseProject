        <p>THE space is huge and airy, with a wall of handsome old small-paned windows at the back. Men, women and children of all races sit expectantly in their seats as the lights go out. A dog barks behind a curtained dressing space as a small, solidly built man slips out and positions himself in the dark. Welcome to the world of Arthur Aviles and his Typical Theater.</p>
        <p>Watching dance at BAAD!, where Mr. Aviles and his company will perform on Friday and Saturday, is a little like landing in a magical, accommodating rabbit hole. The space, whose full name is the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, is in the former American Banknote Building, a warehouse on Barretto Street in the South Bronx. It has been developed as an arts center by Mr. Aviles and the Point, an arts and community organization, with assistance from the Surdna Foundation and Gail and Max Blauner, the building's owners, who have rented the space to Mr. Aviles at low cost. Here, for the last two years, Mr. Aviles's charmingly funky, visionary dance has found a home.</p>

        <p>THE space is huge and airy, with a wall of handsome old small-paned windows at the back. Men, women and children of all races sit expectantly in their seats as the lights go out. A dog barks behind a curtained dressing space as a small, solidly built man slips out and positions himself in the dark. Welcome to the world of Arthur Aviles and his Typical Theater.</p>
        <p>Watching dance at BAAD!, where Mr. Aviles and his company will perform on Friday and Saturday, is a little like landing in a magical, accommodating rabbit hole. The space, whose full name is the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, is in the former American Banknote Building, a warehouse on Barretto Street in the South Bronx. It has been developed as an arts center by Mr. Aviles and the Point, an arts and community organization, with assistance from the Surdna Foundation and Gail and Max Blauner, the building's owners, who have rented the space to Mr. Aviles at low cost. Here, for the last two years, Mr. Aviles's charmingly funky, visionary dance has found a home.</p>
        <p>His performances are one element in a seasonlong series of dance, theater, Latin jazz, poetry readings and photography at both the Point, a few blocks away on Garrison Avenue, and at BAAD! The dance programming will include performances by Full Circle, a hip-hop dance troupe, and Pepper's Contemporary Ballet Theater. The directors of these companies are all resident artists at both the Point and BAAD! Mr. Aviles will also participate in the theater programs in early November, when he appears in ''El Pato Feo'' (''The Ugly Duckling''), a collaboration with Marlyn Matias.</p>
        <p>A rich new strain of modern dance is emerging based on borrowings from African dance, hip-hop and social dancing, and Mr. Aviles embodies that mix. A Bessie Award-winning dancer who performed with Bill T. Jones for seven years, Mr. Aviles, 37, grew up in Jamaica, Queens -- ''the other ghetto,'' as he puts it teasingly -- and trained at Bard College with an eclectic assortment of dance teachers. Much of his work is autobiographical in an abstract way, suffused with his experiences as a gay man. His dances have re-envisioned everything from the highly theatrical 1950 film of Jose Limon's ''Moor's Pavane'' and dances by Martha Graham to the stories of ''Cinderella'' and ''The Wizard of Oz.'' His program this month is called ''The Little Engine That Could,'' named after the children's book, and includes more obviously abstract choreography.</p>
        <p>In the Typical Theater's four years of existence, Mr. Aviles's work has been performed by a surprisingly seamless collection of trained and untrained dancers. Among the untrained are his cousin Elizabeth Marrero, who has gone on to a career of her own as a ''drag king'' named Macha at Manhattan clubs; his brother Moses, also a drag performer, who will serve as host for ''The Little Engine That Could''; and his partner, Charles Rice-Gonzalez. Canela, their dog, is an unofficial muse.</p>
        <p>''Ritual Dance,'' which will be performed this week, is a minimalist work that celebrates the installation of a new dance floor in the BAAD! theater. But the performers clapping and stretching their way through the piece are dressed as a sailor, two angels, ''Arthurella'' -- Mr. Aviles's own character from his ''Cinderella'' piece -- and Toto from ''The Wizard of Oz.''</p>
        <p>Darren Chase, who plays Toto, embodies Mr. Aviles's dance credo. ''Darren is a beautiful mover but really quirky and weird,'' Mr. Aviles said. ''He doesn't do anything like anybody else. He is always rhythmically with everyone but looks like he's falling. He's wonderful for that reason. He's real. This is real stuff.'' Mr. Chase, a trained dancer, met Mr. Aviles at a reception given by Gay Men of the Bronx and was invited to work out with the company. His fervent, innate wackiness was one reason the structure of ''Ritual Dance'' is so strictly organized, Mr. Aviles said.</p>
        <p>''I like people dancing,'' Mr. Aviles said. At the same time, he added, he likes his dancers to be icons. ''I grew up a Puerto Rican person in a ghetto. Those are my references. But I always felt I wanted to connect with Hollywood movies and the comic books, with their fantasy and heroism. People winning in the end. A lot of them didn't reflect where I grew up, so I wanted to do that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aviles was taken aback last year when a review in The New York Times described his work as cheerfully apolitical. Many of his dances inherently involve gay life and issues, after all, reflecting in part the difficulties of being a gay Puerto Rican in the Bronx. Perhaps, it is suggested to him, he is making the most political kind of statement of all by simply presenting that life on stage, without choreographic subtitles.</p>
        <p>''I've been wondering what it means to be political,'' he replied. ''Just to put two men together and have them kiss is maybe not political. But I feel it's important. That's who I am. I am a mix. A little bit of Taino Indian. Black slave. And Spaniard. So I am the conqueror and the victim at the same time.''</p>
        <p>O N the other hand, Mr. Aviles said, he is not interested in delivering messages.</p>
        <p>''I think that what I'm doing is just dance for dancers. Dance for people to see. Heterosexual duets many times are boring for me. I don't have anything against them. It's just boring. So maybe it's not about making a political statement but just about something seeming more interesting to me. There's a choice of doing it this way.''</p>
        <p>Art and life are intertwined for Mr. Aviles and Mr. Rice-Gonzalez. ''Charles and I make an effort at being strong and out and embracing of each other,'' Mr. Aviles said. ''We have to make sure we stand strong. Everybody has their political agendas. Let's stop crying and figure out how to move forward with the things we want to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aviles's other influences include the cardboard-prop street theater presented by Theater for the New City, David Gordon's brand of dance drama and the homegrown performing he sees and loves on subways and in New York's streets. He is fascinated by break-dancing and by the ways French street dancers have distilled it. And he is intrigued by the challenges faced by Full Circle in transplanting an art of quick solos danced inside a circle to a proscenium stage and concert format.</p>
        <p>He is also drawn to pure movement, talking at one moment about the pristine nature of break-dance vocabulary and styles and the next moment about Merce Cunningham and his technique. ''I love the way he twists his torso and the way he can lift a leg and bend it up to the sky and then twist the torso down to the ground, with the right arm reaching to the sky and the left connecting to the ground.''</p>
        <p>For him, he said, ''dance is not a place you get to but the flight in between.'' Fairy tales appeal to him because they lend themselves to transformation. The Spanish title of his ''Puerto Rican retelling'' of ''The Ugly Duckling,''  ''El Pato Feo,'' has two meanings, Mr. Aviles said. '' 'Pato' means duck and faggot. We follow the story but make incremental changes. The ugly duckling flies to different places in Puerto Rico, then to Hunts Point, where it makes its home and becomes a swan.''</p>
