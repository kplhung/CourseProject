        <p>In May, as he bickered with Gov. George W. Bush over the wisdom of allowing individuals to invest portions of their Social Security withholding taxes, Vice President Al Gore made a startling admission: he hadn't made a single dollar from the bull market. In fact, Gore explained, to avoid any conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, he didn't even own stock, and hadn't since 1976, when he first joined Congress. The man fighting for ultimate stewardship of American fiscal policy had taken a pass on the greatest investment opportunity of our time in favor of an interest-bearing checking account.</p>
        <p>The vice president clearly expected that the news would inspire confidence; instead, it inspired Fortune magazine to suggest he could be ''a financial dolt.'' In this era of skyrocketing returns, what inspires confidence is the knowledge that an enormous chunk of your personal wealth derives from securities, especially those in the risky but potentially lucrative technology sector. Stock-market savvy has saturated every corner of society. (Liberty Financial now markets a special mutual fund to clients as young as 11.) By opting out, Gore lost serious street cred -- or at least Wall Street cred.</p>

Stock-market savvy has saturated every corner of society. (Liberty Financial now markets a special mutual fund to clients as young as 11.) By opting out, Gore lost serious street cred -- or at least Wall Street cred.</p>
        <p>In a telling update of the mores established during the 80's, conspicuous equity seems to have supplanted conspicuous consumption as the most effective means of broadcasting your wealth and status. Back in the day when greed was good and barbarians were at the gate, visible symbols of wealth like Rolexes and BMW's were the rage -- but it was still considered slightly gauche to ask someone about his private investments. Almost a decade into the current bull market, for a small but significant group of young and successful individuals, investing has become the new spending. They are deferring the purchase of cars, houses, trips, home furnishings and the like, deciding instead to keep their dollars in the market, where they can generate even more purchasing power in the future. Call it the front-loading of the American dream. Expensive gadgets that help facilitate their investments are legitimate purchases, even status symbols. But mere luxury items, like Marc Jacobs suits and Land Rovers, seem more and more like indulgences, better saved for later. Much later, when you are ready to retire. You know, like at 40.</p>
        <p>But why? I ask Bruce Gibney, a 24-year-old law student who majored in engineering at Stanford. ''The chance that you'll make money now is so good, so obvious, that people just seem profligate if they're not putting it in the market,'' he explains. As a result, the pressure among his peers to announce their latest market triumphs can be huge. ''Your investment in the market reflects your status. One, it reflects your intelligence, and two, it reflects how connected you are. It's not about being invited to one of Mr. and Mrs. Astor's parties anymore; it's how many people you know in really good start-ups. Or you mention 'Series A' -- that's a great way to get somebody's attention: 'I was in Series A, I was in the seed round, I got in for pennies a share.' ''</p>
        <p>Erich Fritz, a 31-year-old manager at an international consulting firm, moved to Seattle last spring and rented a loft. The cavernous space cries out for high-end, high-modern accouterments, but Erich has furnished the place like a room at Motel 6. ''Just last Friday I got a sofa, a coffee table and a desk,'' he says. ''Before Friday I had a bed, and that was it. I was actually sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor for the first two weeks. If you're single and really focusing on your career and investing in your future, it's really not so hard at the end of the day to come home and just shrug and say, 'What the hell, I'll sleep on the floor.' ''</p>
        <p>And when you get right down to it, does any rich adult really need his own apartment? Earlier this year, Dan Lurie, 34, left Los Angeles and moved in with his sister, brother-in-law and their new baby in a small town near Charlotte, N.C. He barters for his room and board, helping out with household chores and assisting them in their business. He drives a Mazda he bought used. But Dan is hardly a slacker. He is an investor. In January he set a goal of making a certain amount (he's shy about the number, but it's in the low six figures) by the end of the year. Through his success in buying and trading ''leaps,'' or options that are realizable nine months or more in the future, he reached his goal in July. He has now set a new goal for December, nearly twice as high as the first. For now he's allowing himself only one consumer fantasy. ''I've talked to some friends about investing in a farm. We could get a hundred acres for $200,000 and put three houses on it. We could have a big organic vegetable garden and trade stocks all day.'' And as for the long term? ''I've always wanted to be semiretired by 40,'' he tells me. ''I want to travel around the world.''</p>
        <p>That's the dream: stocks now, the world at 40. Retirement at 40. Dinner parties and families and novels at 40. I heard it again and again as I talked to these prudent 20- and 30-somethings. But I worry for them about how possible it will be to achieve.</p>
        <p>Not just because there is no telling where the market will land. (Though when everything you've got can fit in an Ameritrade account, the difference between guessing right and losing the farm can come down to perilously little.) The market is risky, but these guys know that. They've all lost money at one point or another. And if they think they can stay one step ahead of the Dow -- well, they might very well be right.</p>
        <p>The more relevant question is not where the market will land, but where these eager workaholics will land. It's one thing to work hard during the week to make sure your weekend is free; these guys are signing over at least two solid decades of their lives -- to the willful exclusion of a comfortable home life, time to spend with friends, small indulgences and who knows what else. They think that if they hold on just a little longer, let things ride through one more uptick, they'll reach a plateau at which they can trade in their 80-hour-a-week grind for an eternity of leisurely, unstructured fun. But what are the odds that, having spent their entire lives in the glow of a computer screen, they will be able to reinvent themselves in middle age as carefree bons vivants? Of all the speculations they've made, the most sanguine by far is the gamble that they'll be able to enjoy the life they've worked so hard to buy.</p>
