        <p>The crowd arrived early yesterday at Shea Stadium and so did the hubris. The fans were lured by sunny autumn weather and a chance for a tailgate party on a weekend afternoon. Their overconfidence came from the Mets' two-games-to-none lead over the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>Assuming the Mets would win Game 3 yesterday with Rick Reed as their starting pitcher, someone asked Bobby J. Jones how he would feel about a chance to pitch the clinching game today to complete the sweep and send the Mets into the World Series.</p>
        <p>''It would be real exciting,'' Jones said. ''I would welcome the feeling.''</p>
        <p>Jones did not mean to sound cocky. The question was in harmony with the pregame mood, and he was just cooperating. He pitched a one-hit shutout against San Francisco last Sunday to eliminate the Giants.  And everyone expected a good outing yesterday from Reed.</p>
        <p>But after the sun set Saturday, many fans left early and a different psychological atmosphere set in.</p>
        <p>Reed gave up 5 runs on 8 hits and lasted only three and a third innings. After the Mets lost by 8-2 to the Cardinals, the team and its fans looked to Jones not to finish a sweep today but to prevent St. Louis from leveling the four-of-seven series at two victories apiece.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals hit right-handers better than they hit left-handers. Both Reed and Jones are right-handers. Before the game, Jones said he would try to do things differently from Reed because they throw so similarly.</p>
        <p>''You have to mix it up,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Reed seemed mixed up from the beginning yesterday. He gave up a single to the leadoff hitter, Fernando Vina. Although he struck out three hitters to conclude the Cardinals' two-run first, he needed three good fielding plays to escape the third inning.</p>
        <p>''I was nervous,'' Reed said. ''I won't lie to you.''</p>
        <p>But he added that it was the same sort of feeling he experienced in playoff games before, last season and this season, when he had more success.</p>
        <p>''When I needed to make a quality pitch, I just didn't do it,'' Reed said of yesterday's performance. ''And if you don't make quality pitches to a lineup like that, they're going to hit you around a little bit and that's what they did.''</p>
        <p>Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said: ''He didn't have his fastball tonight, didn't locate his fastball. When he made a good pitch, he wasn't making it consistently. Got it called a few times there to get out of the first inning, then wasn't as consistent as he usually is.''</p>
        <p>His best moments came in the first inning, after the first four batters reached base and two of them crossed the plate. The pitching coach, Dave Wallace, rushed to the mound and spoke to Reed, who then struck out Ray Lankford, Fernando Tatis and J. D. Drew.</p>
        <p>''I think he just calmed me down a little bit,'' Reed said.</p>
        <p>But the calm did not last. After St. Louis scored two more runs in the third, Valentine let Reed lead off the bottom of the inning and he flied out. In the fourth, Reed was relieved by the left-hander Glendon Rusch, who ended the inning by getting the pinch-hitter Mark McGwire on a fly ball to left with the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>Rusch was a starter in the regular season. Since Valentine pulled Rusch for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the fourth, after he had thrown only nine pitches, would Rusch be able to work again in relief in Game 4 if Jones experiences difficulties similar to Reed's?</p>
        <p>''Rusch is very available,'' Valentine said. Rusch said the same thing.</p>
        <p>As for Jones, Valentine said, ''Jones pitched a great game the last time he pitched and I'm looking forward to the same thing tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Jones was reminded that people around town are calling his series-clinching performance against San Francisco one of the best in the history of the franchise.</p>
        <p>''It's great to be mentioned, my name with a lot of these other great players,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>But it is not something he is going to dwell on, he said. It has been a season of variety for him, with an 11-6 record in the regular season and a stint in the minor leagues for physical rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>''Once my game is over, the next day I focus on my next job,'' Jones said.</p>
