        <p>IT is not much to look at:a 50-acre slice of Perth Amboy's waterfront dotted with empty factories and polluted, rubble-strewn lots. They are the remnants of industry's exodus in the 1970's from this once-bustling port city across the Raritan Bay and Arthur Kill from Staten Island.</p>
        <p>But that is about to change. Last month local officials completed an agreement with a developer to transform this piece of the city's past into a $600 million development, called the Landings at Harborside. It is to mix 2,000 condominium apartments and town houses with a 300-room hotel and some 170,000 square feet of retail space, including restaurants, stores and a movie theater. There will also be parks, a cultural center, a public waterfront promenade and parking for 4,200 cars.</p>

        <p>IT is not much to look at:a 50-acre slice of Perth Amboy's waterfront dotted with empty factories and polluted, rubble-strewn lots. They are the remnants of industry's exodus in the 1970's from this once-bustling port city across the Raritan Bay and Arthur Kill from Staten Island.</p>
        <p>But that is about to change. Last month local officials completed an agreement with a developer to transform this piece of the city's past into a $600 million development, called the Landings at Harborside. It is to mix 2,000 condominium apartments and town houses with a 300-room hotel and some 170,000 square feet of retail space, including restaurants, stores and a movie theater. There will also be parks, a cultural center, a public waterfront promenade and parking for 4,200 cars.</p>
        <p>The development is the first of several projects expected to get under way in the next 12 to 18 months as part of this city's redevelopment plan to reclaim large swaths of its former industrial land. It is also consistent with the plan's focus on a mix of uses, from housing to retailing and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Harborside is to take shape in four phases on the property, parts of which must be cleaned of contaminants, with construction to start next summer. Some 42 families and 15 businesses must be relocated from the site, which is bordered mainly by High Street, Smith Street and Buckingham Avenue. The entire project will take up to eight years to complete, according to the developer, Westminster Communities, an affiliate of the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, N.J.</p>
        <p>''We're basically building a new city at the water's edge,'' said Jeffrey Freireich, a principal at both Kushner and Westminster, ''and believe the rewards outweigh the risks.''</p>
        <p>This month local officials also designated an operator to run a high-speed ferry service to Manhattan as well as to build a landing barge and terminal, which along with parking, will rise on nine acres adjacent to Harborside. The operator, Lighthouse Fast Ferry of West Caldwell, N.J., runs two such ferries between the Highlands in Monmouth County and Manhattan and expects to have the Perth Amboy ferry running by next summer.</p>
        <p>While many residents feel the redevelopment plan in general and the Harborside project in particular could rejuvenate the city, they are worried about coping with increased traffic and blending the old city with the new. Some people who must relocate are also concerned about moving and finding comparable housing elsewhere in the city.</p>
        <p>AMONG them is Bernie Parkhurst, who with her husband, Mark, both in their 30's, lives in the house she grew up in on Commerce Street, near the water. ''Yes, the area needs to be improved,'' Ms. Parkhurst said. ''But in the meantime what do we do?'' Not everyone can afford the new housing, she said. And one commercial property owner is suing the city, contending its redevelopment plan is improper.</p>
        <p>Mayor Joseph Vas said the project's benefits outnumbered the perceived negatives, which will be addressed. He said the development would not only increase the stock of middle-income housing in Perth Amboy, a city of 55,000, and bring in tax revenue and jobs but would also serve ''as the engine that will drive investment in the rest of the city.''</p>
        <p>Besides the waterfront, the other areas in the city's Focus 2000 redevelopment plan are in the northeastern and southwestern sectors of Perth Amboy. In all, the plan calls for reusing 700 former industrial acres, and in the last month the city has selected developers to rebuild parcels in the other areas as well.</p>
        <p>By early next year, for instance, Matrix Development Group of Cranbury, N.J., known for building big box warehouses, plans to begin to transform 26 acres in the city's northeast quadrant into up to a half million square feet of light industrial and manufacturing space in one to two buildings. The site, formerly occupied by Chevron, has sat dormant for many years.</p>
        <p>Plans also call for about 68 more acres in that section to be used for an arena with 9,000 to 12,000 seats and a minor league baseball stadium with 5,000. The site, occupied by an industrial complex once used by a smelting and refinery operation, is to be redeveloped by a partnership of R.B.I. of Newark and OENJ Cherokee of Bayonne. Construction is expected to start in the next 18 to 24 months.</p>
        <p>The mix of uses ''will assure the economic vitality of the city,'' Mayor Vas said, adding that the projects announced so far are expected to produce 7,000 permanent jobs and more than $24 million a year in tax revenue, starting within five years. That revenue compares with about $18 million a year lost in 1970 to 1990, when industry moved out and shifted the tax burden to homeowners, he said, adding that developers are not being given tax abatements.</p>
        <p>Perth Amboy's redevelopment effort follows those of Hudson River cities like Jersey City and Hoboken. Such efforts are bolstered by the economy, renewed interest in urban living and the state's development and redevelopment plan. The plan encourages growth in areas where highways, sewers and mass transit are available and discourages it where they are lacking.</p>
        <p>Though the city adopted its redevelopment plan in 1997, it has been setting the stage for it over the last decade. In that time it attracted public money to revive its faltering downtown and begin to rebuild its waterfront. The latter included building a new marina and restoring a historic ferry slip.</p>
        <p>HARBORSIDE ''is the natural next step for the waterfront,'' Mayor Vas said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freireich said Westminster is involved with the project because ''we believe the future trend is in urban living.'' Along with the state's efforts to push growth to cities, he said, Perth Amboy's pursuit of redevelopment was another factor.</p>
        <p>Westminster will finance construction of the project privately and has already ''pumped over $2 million into it,'' Mr. Freireich said. But his company, he added, will seek state and federal assistance to clean contaminated areas, a process he called ''doable.'' It is also under contract to buy some parcels and is negotiating to buy others.</p>
        <p>The Tri-State Ship Repair and Dry Dock Company, which owns 12 acres that have been used for a dry dock operation for more than a century, has contested the city's redevelopment plan. William D. Grand, the lawyer for Tri-State, said the company is one of only a few such operations in the Port of New York and therefore is an ''important business to the port and region.''</p>
        <p>The company, he said, challenged the city's right to include the site in a redevelopment plan meant to improve blighted, unproductive properties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grand said the city had recently filed ''essentially the same petition to dismiss the complaint'' as one denied in March by the Superior Court of Middlesex County. He said pending the outcome of the recent petition, which is to be decided soon, his client would continue to fight.</p>
        <p>Mayor Vas would not comment about the litigation. Mr. Freireich said he was confident a resolution can be reached because ''the site is important to the redevelopment.'' Meanwhile, he said, his company will, if necessary, initially build around the 12 acres, even though they are part of the first phase.</p>
        <p>Depending on whether the 12-acre parcel is out or in, that phase is to have 400 residences and 25,000 square feet of stores or 600 residences and 70,000 square feet of stores. In either case, there will also be two restaurants. Though prices for the units have not been set, Mr. Freireich said they were expected to start at $225,000 for the condominiums, averaging 1,100 square feet, and $400,000 for the town houses, averaging 2,000 square feet. He said the housing would be marketed to young professional couples and empty nesters.</p>
        <p>To address concerns about traffic, city officials say they are pursuing plans for an extension from High Street to Route 440, which connects to the Outerbridge Crossing to Staten Island, and they are seeking $4.5 million in public money. The hope is that much of the traffic from Harborside and future projects will be directed to the new road and not clog city streets.</p>
        <p>And to put together a relocation plan, the city has hired Abeles Phillips Preiss &amp; Shapiro, a planning and real estate consulting firm in Manhattan. State law requires the property owners be paid a fair market price for their property as well as relocation expenses and dislocation benefits. No specific timetable has been set for the plan.</p>
        <p>''Perth Amboy should utilize its waterfront as other waterside communities have done,'' said Donald E. Zupko, 53, who lives in a 100-year-old Victorian near the waterfront on Lewis Street. ''It could be better for this city. Things must go on; things change.''</p>
