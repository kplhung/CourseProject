        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>There is a certain irony to Woody Allen's essay on Patrick Ewing's departure from the Knicks. Perhaps the perspective of a courtside season ticket-holder becomes a bit warped over the years, but Patrick  Ewing's career is seen in a much different light from the ''cheap'' seats.</p>
        <p>No one will ever accuse Ewing of dogging it, but he should not be included in a list of the 50 greatest players. Ewing's legacy is one of longevity and, unfortunately, missing the big shot rather than making it. A great player never would have missed the finger roll against Indiana in the playoffs. A great player never would have stood away from the basket while Charles Smith was stuffed time and again by the Bulls' defense. Great players have the ability to enforce their will on the big game. I cannot remember this to be true about Ewing.</p>

        <p>No one will ever accuse Ewing of dogging it, but he should not be included in a list of the 50 greatest players. Ewing's legacy is one of longevity and, unfortunately, missing the big shot rather than making it. A great player never would have missed the finger roll against Indiana in the playoffs. A great player never would have stood away from the basket while Charles Smith was stuffed time and again by the Bulls' defense. Great players have the ability to enforce their will on the big game. I cannot remember this to be true about Ewing.</p>
        <p>But perhaps what is most telling about Ewing is that unlike other great players, Ewing never sought to renegotiate his contract to free up salary-cap room and improve the team. The better players were never brought in, and the Knicks remained a player or so short of the title. If the Knicks lacked chemistry, some of the blame must surely lie at Patrick's feet.</p>
        <p>Woody Allen may be right: there is more to sports than big money. But it's a lesson Ewing has yet to learn. He was a good player. But one of the 50 greatest athletes? Or one of the top two Knicks? Not even close.</p>
