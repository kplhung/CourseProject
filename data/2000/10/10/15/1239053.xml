        <p>Although business in general may favor Republican presidents, history shows that the stock market appears to prefer Democrats.</p>
        <p>Pedro Santa-Clara and Rossen Valkanov, finance professors at the Anderson School at the University of California at Los Angeles, have examined the market's average performance during Republican and Democratic administrations from 1927 to 1998. Specifically, they analyzed the average returns investors received by putting money in the stock market, versus the three-month Treasury bill.</p>
        <p>Under Democratic presidents, the professors found, the stock market returned 11 percent more than the average annual return of the T-bill. Under Republicans, the advantage was just 2 percent.</p>
        <p>The difference was more pronounced when taking market capitalization into account. The researchers found, for example, that small-cap stocks returned 18 percent more than the T-bills when Democrats were in office but that T-bills outperformed the small caps by 3 percent under Republicans. For large caps, the average excess return was 10 percent under Democrats and 2 percent under Republicans.</p>
        <p>Why have stocks fared better under Democrats? The researchers aren't sure.</p>
        <p>''Democratic economic policies may have had some beneficial effect on the stock market,'' Professor Santa-Clara said.</p>
        <p>''Another possibility has to do with investor expectation,'' he added.</p>
        <p>He said the research showed that when investors anticipated a Democrat in the White House, the market often became volatile. ''The popular belief has been that Republicans do better for business and for the market,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Is today's troubled market trying to tell us something?</p>
        <p>''You'll have to draw your own conclusions,'' Professor Santa-Clara said.</p>
