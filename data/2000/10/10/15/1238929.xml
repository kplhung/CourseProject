        <p>HOW refreshing to find an arts center that is artist-centered. With its active exhibition program that includes three juried annuals, the Perkins Center has been diligently working here to nurture regional talent and to establish a professional reputation that goes beyond South Jersey.</p>
        <p>This year's ''Works on Paper'' show raised the stakes with a newly established purchase prize for the permanent collection of the Delaware Art Museum. In addition to the regular juror's cash awards, the potential of a museum purchase undoubtedly explains why the exhibition attracted the largest number of entries in its 11-year history. A total of 481 pieces (almost 100 more than last year) were submitted by 210 artists from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland. To maintain the regional focus of this show, all work must be hand-delivered.</p>

        <p>HOW refreshing to find an arts center that is artist-centered. With its active exhibition program that includes three juried annuals, the Perkins Center has been diligently working here to nurture regional talent and to establish a professional reputation that goes beyond South Jersey.</p>
        <p>This year's ''Works on Paper'' show raised the stakes with a newly established purchase prize for the permanent collection of the Delaware Art Museum. In addition to the regular juror's cash awards, the potential of a museum purchase undoubtedly explains why the exhibition attracted the largest number of entries in its 11-year history. A total of 481 pieces (almost 100 more than last year) were submitted by 210 artists from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland. To maintain the regional focus of this show, all work must be hand-delivered.</p>
        <p>As guest juror, Alejandro Anreus, curator at the Jersey City Museum, chose 79 works by 69 artists. Viewing so many entries ''in the flesh'' might seem like a daunting task, but Mr. Anreus said there was ''nothing like the concrete artifact.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anreus said the exhibition reflected ''great technical skill charged with authentic artistic vision.'' The group of intimately sized works is eclectic but safe; nothing can be deemed trendy or provocative. He chose only nine watercolors, while prints make up approximately a third of the show. Although three-dimensional works on a paper surface could be submitted, there is only one object on display -- a book titled ''Stretch,'' which is essentially a collection of linoleum prints by Stephanie Sabo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anreus has a definite appreciation for mixed media works, particularly collages like the Surrealistic images of papier-colle by Cynthia Dorsey Brown. At the same time, there are several fascinating mixed-media pieces that give subtle three-dimensionality to predominately flat surfaces. ''Cityscape,'' a finely crafted threaded embossment by Herbert Appelson of Cherry Hill, is a luminous image of color harmonies and geometric patterns, while Deanne De Nyse's ''Thirteen Gold Rivets'' is a composition that incorporates silkscreen, photo etching, and real metal rings that look more like grommets than rivets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anreus designated 10 works for cash awards. Without ranking, all are given equal distinction. The group is a true microcosm of the full exhibition, comprising different aesthetic sensibilities and techniques.</p>
        <p>''Earthmatters No. 7'' by Inga Pickering of Medford Lakes, one of two prize winners from New Jersey, is a controlled graphite drawing based on geological forms.</p>
        <p>Laura Fields demonstrates a virtuosic control of the watercolor medium. Her realistic illustration based on ''The Cock and the Jewel,'' a classic Aesop's fable, brings to mind the ornithological imagery of John James Audubon. Like the 19th-century watercolorist, she combines an excellent sense of color and design, precise details and expressive body language. As a tragic hero, the hungry rooster finds only an exquisitely cut sapphire, not a single grain of corn. With its moral about what may be precious to one and worthless to another, this work indirectly raises the show's only social message.</p>
        <p>Mixed media works are some of the most interesting in the show. Rodney Gates of Bridgeton is the other award winner from New Jersey. His collage called ''History Makers'' is a combination of various materials and patterns, but the dominant element is the leather-tooled binding of a text that identifies itself as ''The World's History and Its Makers.'' Both Ben Franklin (a stamp) and Mickey Mouse (a T-shirt label) are present. Juxtaposed with these, bringing to mind thoughts of the Holocaust are burlap that is fringed like a Jewish prayer shawl and a small yellow star.</p>
        <p>''Mother, Father, Child'' by Janis Pinkston is an intriguing portrayal of a nuclear family, which was chosen as both a juror's prize-winner and the museum purchase award. Ms. Pinkston uses her own face on all three similarly positioned figures, saying ''I'll be my own family.'' The word ''mute'' in red letters under the artist's name at the lower corner is directly inspired by the message that appears on the television screen when the mute button of the remote has been pressed. According to the artist, it underscores how ''painting has no voice.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Miller Batty, chief curator at the Delaware Art Museum, picked Ms. Pinkston's work, saying it ''will enhance the museum's collection of works on paper by African-American artists and will be exhibited on a regular basis.''</p>
