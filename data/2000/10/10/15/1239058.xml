        <p>SHOULD rats have rights? Should mice have standing? Does the canary's desire to sing deserve the law's protection?</p>
        <p>At least in a practical sense, these knotty questions have now been settled. Not by philosophers but in a deal cut last week between the Department of Agriculture and an arm of the Anti-Vivisection Society known as the Alternatives Research and Development Foundation. The agreement commits the department to extend the protection of the Animal Welfare Act to the rats, mice and birds used in the nation's research laboratories, circuses and elsewhere. But research institutions, concerned that they might have to file paperwork for each pair of whiskers that passes their portals, have persuaded Congress to mandate a year's delay in even writing the rules.</p>
        <p>The law applies only to warm-blooded animals and until now the secretary of agriculture has restricted it to cats, dogs, monkeys, hamsters, rabbits and guinea pigs -- in short, to the pettable, not the pestilential.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department agreed to a deal including mice, rats and birds for fear it could have been ordered by a court to do so immediately and without opportunity for the usual rule-making procedures.</p>
        <p>Because of the close similarity between mice and men, at least at the level of the genome, the little rodents have traded on their cousinship to become one of the most popular inhabitants of research labs. The 23 million rats, mice and birds used last year in the nation's laboratories accounted for 95 percent of all animal use. So including them in the Animal Protection Act is a vast extension of the law's reach.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ron DeHaven, a veterinarian in the Agriculture Department's animal care division, has 75 inspectors to enforce the act. The mice will bring a 10-fold increase in the number of animals they oversee. Unless Congress raises the number of inspectors proportionately, they will resort to random sampling instead of looking at every animal in every cage as they do at present.</p>
        <p>Dr. DeHaven said his inspectors do find some cases of animal abuse, but far fewer than in the past, and ''almost always in a situation where there has been unintended negligence and not willful intent.''</p>
        <p>The Act carves out rather capacious rights for its favored species. It describes the temperature, ventilation and space in which animals are to be kept. Dogs must be properly exercised. The primates' psychological needs have to be met. Pain and distress are to be minimized. And for every painful experiment researchers must consider alternative ways of acquiring the information.</p>
        <p>The fruits of the law's protection can be seen on touring almost any animal research laboratory. The monkeys are caged, but they have televisions and can be seen enjoying episodes of ''Star Trek.'' Room service includes a carefully chosen and nutritious diet. Visitors, gowned and booted so as not to expose the animals to human germs, are instructed not to stare at the monkeys -- a universal primate challenge -- for fear of upsetting them.</p>
        <p>Despite being excluded from the law's privileges, laboratory mice have come to enjoy equivalent standards of luxury, even if they don't have tiny televisions in their suites. There is all-you-can-eat mouse chow, free veterinary care and a guaranteed absence of feline harassment.</p>
        <p>Many mice now used in laboratories are knockouts, meaning they lack one of their genes. It takes about two years to develop a knockout mouse, but the animals are invaluable for determining what a gene does by figuring out what it is that the knockout mouse cannot do.</p>
        <p>Knockout mice are so precious and expensive that they are kept in pathogen-free conditions, which requires them to be housed at vast expense in climate-controlled rooms and attended by every comfort known to animal husbandry.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, pros and cons to this situation from the mouse's point of view. One could be assigned to a cancer experiment and injected with tumor cells. At the other extreme, one could be selected for a longevity study and get to live 40 percent longer than usual, all at taxpayer expense. Like life in the wild, survival is uncertain.</p>
        <p>Still, if mice are so well cared for, why did the Alternatives Research and Development Foundation sue the Agriculture Department to include them under the Animal Welfare Act? Dr. John E. McArdle, the foundation's director, said he was attracted by the requirement the law lays on researchers to consider alternative ways of gathering their information. The foundation is not anti-research, Dr. McArdle said, but would like to see use of experimental animals minimized.</p>
        <p>''Because we are an alternatives foundation, we want people to think about alternatives,'' he said. By getting 20 million rats and mice into the Act, Dr. McArdle will indeed prompt a great deal of alternative thought.</p>
