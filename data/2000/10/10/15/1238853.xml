        <p>'The Perpetual Well'  Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton. Through Nov. 12. (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Subtitled ''Contemporary Art From the Collection of the Jewish Museum,'' this expansive and generally stimulating traveling exhibition starts with the premise that spiritual traditions and new interpretations of traditions form a continuous source of inspiration -- a perpetual well -- for artistic content. Against this backdrop, the innovative approaches to painting, sculpture, photography and installation art throughout the galleries seem to be a natural result of aligning contemporary thought and practice with inherited beliefs.</p>

        <p>'The Perpetual Well'  Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton. Through Nov. 12. (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Subtitled ''Contemporary Art From the Collection of the Jewish Museum,'' this expansive and generally stimulating traveling exhibition starts with the premise that spiritual traditions and new interpretations of traditions form a continuous source of inspiration -- a perpetual well -- for artistic content. Against this backdrop, the innovative approaches to painting, sculpture, photography and installation art throughout the galleries seem to be a natural result of aligning contemporary thought and practice with inherited beliefs.</p>
        <p>The show is meaty, containing and generating a jumble of intense moods. Donna Harkavy, the guest curator for this Jewish Museum project, has mined that institution's collection well. Perhaps too well, however, for everything has been placed into thematic categories that are sometimes justified, like the sections dealing with ritual and biblical legend, but in too many frustrating instances appear to compartmentalize a work that should have been allowed its wings. Ms. Harkavy's informative individual labels would have provided sufficient suggestions concerning meaning.</p>
        <p>This is felt most keenly when the issue of marginalization is raised, particularly in the identity section.  Selections like Deborah Kass's powerful diptych ''Subject Matters'' and Elaine Reichek's installation ''A Postcolonial Kinderhood'' have rich, complicated messages that are capable of triggering a universal resonance. To a degree this is true also of Ken Aptekar's multiple composition ''I Hate the Name Kenneth,'' and Dennis Kardon's ''Lover's Quarrel.''</p>
        <p>One of the exhibition's strengths is in the way method and message are linked in selections from every category. Luis Camnitzer evokes the character of earlier centuries in grainy woodblock prints illustrating a theological text by Martin Buber, and Robert Wilson develops the physical sense of a mystical biblical figure containing the spirit of the absent and the present in his sculpture ''The Golem.''</p>
        <p>A number of very successful pieces in a section highlighting Israel also seem to burst beyond their category. Effective treatments of desert imagery by Stuart Klipper and Michal Rovner are especially notable.</p>
        <p>Bob Mitchell  Stepping Stone Gallery, 356 New York Avenue, Huntington. Through Oct. 22. (631) 424-1650.</p>
        <p>Looking intensely at real settings with real people living out their lives is basic to the kind of black and white documentary photography that is important to Bob Mitchell, and so, too, is a dedication to finding the right combination of personality, design and dramatic light contrasts. Applying this sense of observation and chance encounter to Huntington residents seemed to be a worthy project with the potential to provide useful community insight.</p>
        <p>This small show, ''Life: Huntington, N.Y.,'' is based on the way the project evolved in recent months. It offers strong material in its images of adults, but is somewhat diluted by a large proportion of photographs of teenagers who appear to be posturing. One exception is ''Theresa,'' a memorable portrait of a young woman that emphasizes three telling attributes: her hairbrush, jeans and high-style sneakers.</p>
        <p>Photographs built around some humanizing quality are the most successful. An elderly man instinctively reaching out to guide a woman across a busy road is one example, and ''Lorraine and Mary,'' featuring the quiet chemistry between two people resting on a bench, is another.</p>
        <p>Using objects, figures, and lighting, masterful compositions treating a solitary smoker and a family of clothing shoppers have a strong art quality. These, as well as the less interesting images of teens in motion lend a sense of energy to village life.</p>
        <p>Thom Thompson  University Art Gallery, Stony Brook. To Oct. 21. (631) 632-7240.</p>
        <p>Initially trained as a painter, Thom Thompson began his long involvement with the avant-garde aspects of film and photography in 1969, while in a graduate program at Ohio University. His creativity has been recognized with grants and awards, and now the Shoreham resident is having his first retrospective.</p>
        <p>While the photographs dominate the galleries, a selection of six short films playing on a video monitor is an important introduction to Mr. Thompson's technical virtuosity, sense of dynamic imagery and to his ideas about montage and multiple editing processes. Most important, the films alert visitors to his commitment to different presentations of reality.</p>
        <p>The three-minute ''Swing,'' for example, blends two kinds of motion and two kinds of rhythm with drawings applied to the film frames. The 10-minute ''Process'' cuts, weaves, shifts and reverses footage dealing with student protests at the Ohio campus and produces figures that seem to be mutating. Mr. Thompson seems conscious of how photography and film address time and memory in ways that painting cannot.</p>
        <p>The overview of photographs is organized into seven thematic categories. Complicated pieces that include the silk-screen process have a marked conceptual orientation and use lettering and an ironic thrust to comment on news events and social issues.</p>
        <p>Other groupings involve carefully considered visual and technical adjustments to produce a particular effect. The massiveness of a boat hull might be expressed by allowing it to fill the frame, for example. Most of the selections in other parts of the exhibition call attention to innovative ways of combining formal impact with subjective content.</p>
