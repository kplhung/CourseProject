        <p>A Sign of Progress In a Georgia Contest</p>
        <p>Here's a tale of racial and political progress in the Old South.</p>
        <p>Georgia's Second Congressional District, in the state's southwest corner, is 60 percent white. But its representative in the House, Sanford D. Bishop Jr., is black.</p>
        <p>In 1992, when Mr. Bishop, a moderate Democrat, was first elected, the district was 60 percent black, its boundaries having been drawn earlier to make it that way to satisfy new voting rights requirements. It was still predominantly black when Mr. Bishop was re-elected in 1994.</p>
        <p>But in 1995 the courts held that the earlier redistricting had gone too far in favor of blacks. The boundaries were shifted again, this time leaving the district 60 percent white.</p>
        <p>Not to worry. Mr. Bishop won re-election easily in 1996, getting almost 55 percent of the vote. A lot of white voters said they liked his moderate politics. And in 1998, he won still again, going unopposed in the primary and capturing the general election with almost 60 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>This year?</p>
        <p>Again, Mr. Bishop faced no primary opponent. But he is up against an aggressive Republican in the fall, Dylan Glenn, an economic development specialist and former aide to the Bush White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glenn is black. Two years ago, he tried to win the Republican nomination and the right to take on Mr. Bishop but was beaten by a white businessman, Joe McCormick, who then was beaten by Mr. Bishop. This year Mr. McCormick is one of Mr. Glenn's campaign chairmen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glenn says that while the Second District was Old South in the old days, ''the race card has been taken off the table.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop agrees. He told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the other day that race had become the ''so what'' issue in the district.</p>
        <p>Issue of Misconduct For a Judge-Elect</p>
        <p>In Louisiana, the politics, like the food, comes well spiced. Think Huey Long and jambalaya or Edwin W. Edwards and file gumbo.</p>
        <p>And consider . . .</p>
        <p>Since 1988, Yvonne L. Hughes, a New Orleans lawyer, has run 15 times for state, local and party offices. Twice she won a seat on the Orleans Parish Democratic Executive Committee and twice she won a seat on the Democratic State Committee. But the job she wanted most, Juvenile Court judge, kept eluding her.</p>
        <p>She was fond of saying that judges could get answers that other mortals could not. She talked of the power of a judge to keep the city's troubled youngsters on the ''scared straight'' and narrow, of helping them by deploying a corps of volunteer youth workers and by imposing boot-camp-style discipline.</p>
        <p>Finally, two weeks ago, she managed to oust one of the parish's five juvenile judges, Salvadore Mule,  beating him by a solid 15 points.</p>
        <p>It seemed not to matter very much to a majority of voters that Ms. Hughes, while she was running, was under a well-publicized order to pay the Louisiana Ethics Board almost $50,000 in fines and fees for filing campaign reports late in six earlier elections. Nor did it seem to matter much that the board said that even after it levied the fines, she continued to resist producing the reports.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, however, her troubles grew more serious -- perhaps serious enough to give some of her supporters second thoughts.</p>
        <p>Or maybe not. Laissez-faire.</p>
        <p>The Louisiana Office of Disciplinary Counsel, which handles accusations of lawyer misconduct, charged that in recent years she had taken $4,000 in fees from five criminal defendants without doing any work for them. When one defendant demanded a refund, the Disciplinary Counsel complaint said, she sent him partial refund checks twice -- and twice the checks bounced.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes denied the accusations, saying none of them were of ''any moment or consequence.''</p>
        <p>If convicted, she could face sanctions ranging from a reprimand to disbarment. Should it be the latter, presumably her career as a judge would be over, whatever slack supporters might be willing to cut her.</p>
        <p>Polls Put Gore in Lead In Electoral College</p>
        <p>The Hotline, the popular Internet political tip sheet, keeps a running tab of presidential preference polls in various states. At any moment, those polls provide a rough (very rough) indication of where the electoral vote contest stands -- at that moment. Here's where things stood at midday Friday, when The Hotline posted its latest compilation:</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas led in 26 states, worth 227 electoral votes. Vice President Al Gore led in 23 states, worth 281 electoral votes.</p>
        <p>Needed to win: 270 electoral votes.</p>
        <p>The Reality Behind Some Poll Numbers</p>
        <p>There are polls and there are polls. And the argument seems never to end over whether they are to be trusted, whether there is too much reliance on them and whether they skew the political process.</p>
        <p>That said, here are some poll numbers put together by the Pew Research Center, which keeps a close eye on things political:</p>
        <p>In 1996, 96 percent of voters said they planned to vote on Election Day. In fact, only 48.8 percent voted.</p>
        <p>This year, 97 percent of voters say they plan to vote.</p>
