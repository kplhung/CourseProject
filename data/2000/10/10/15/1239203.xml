        <p>On a resplendent fall day when Fusaichi Pegasus stayed back in his barn, Lemon Drop Kid ran fifth in the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup yesterday while Albert the Great was sweeping the race by six lengths and muddling the ultimate race for Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>The day proved especially sunny for Nick Zito, who saddled two of the five stakes winners on Belmont Park's Breeders' Cup preview day: He not only scored in the Gold Cup but also won the $500,000 Champagne Stakes for 2-year-old colts with A.P. Valentine. And he matched the record set by the late Eddie Neloy in the 1960's when he won the Champagne three years in a row. Zito also ran second and third in the Frizette for juvenile fillies.</p>

        <p>On a resplendent fall day when Fusaichi Pegasus stayed back in his barn, Lemon Drop Kid ran fifth in the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup yesterday while Albert the Great was sweeping the race by six lengths and muddling the ultimate race for Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>The day proved especially sunny for Nick Zito, who saddled two of the five stakes winners on Belmont Park's Breeders' Cup preview day: He not only scored in the Gold Cup but also won the $500,000 Champagne Stakes for 2-year-old colts with A.P. Valentine. And he matched the record set by the late Eddie Neloy in the 1960's when he won the Champagne three years in a row. Zito also ran second and third in the Frizette for juvenile fillies.</p>
        <p>Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Lemon Drop Kid, said that Jerry Bailey and his mount, Behrens, had come over and ''knocked him down'' at the starting gate, but he insisted that his horse would be ready for the Breeders' Cup Classic in three weeks. And Lemon Drop Kid's jockey, Edgar Prado, said that ''Behrens slammed us hard out of the gate, and we lost all momentum.''</p>
        <p>Albert the Great has won five of his 12 starts this year at 3, and yesterday he outran six older stars. He ran first almost all the way, wrested the lead from Gander after half a mile and beat him to the wire. Gander had three lengths on Vision and Verse, with the French import Agol Lack fourth followed by the heavy hitters Lemon Drop Kid, Behrens and Skimming.</p>
        <p>Albert the Great, owned by Tracy Farmer, ran the mile and one-quarter under Jorge Chavez in 1:59.24, paid $13 for a $2 bet to win and earned $600,000.</p>
        <p>In the day's second feature, the $750,000 Beldame, the Brazilian-bred Riboletta took long strides toward the championship for older fillies and mares when she ran down Beautiful Pleasure and won by two lengths. It was her sixth straight victory and the seventh in her last eight starts, all graded stakes going back to March.</p>
        <p>The path to the championship seemed even closer for Riboletta when another contender, Heritage of Gold, ran out of the money in the Spinster Stakes at Keeneland. But Aaron Jones, who owns Riboletta, said he doubted that he would spend the $400,000 supplemental fee required of unregistered horses to enter the Breeders' Cup.</p>
        <p>John T. Ward, who trains Beautiful Pleasure, characterized the race as ''the battle of the titans.'' Rich Schosberg, the trainer of Pentatonic, who ran third, said, ''Riboletta is a freak of nature.''</p>
        <p>The 130th running of the Champagne was won by the lightly raced A.P. Valentine, a son of A.P. Indy, in only his third start. The colt, owned by the Celtic Pride Stable of Rick Pitino, won on the inside by a length and three-quarters over Bob Baffert's Point Given, who had three-quarters of a length on the D. Wayne Lukas juvenile, Yonaguska. Two other well-rated colts struck out: City Zip running seventh, and Scorpion, finishing ninth. A.P. Valentine covered the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:41.45.</p>
        <p>''He is an unbelievable horse,'' Zito said of A.P. Valentine. ''He might be my best.''</p>
        <p>In the $500,000 Frizette for 2-year-old fillies, Raging Fever extended her perfect record to five victories in five starts and clinched a trip to the Breeders' Cup as the favorite among juvenile fillies. She is owned by Edward P. Evans and trained by Mark Hennig, and ran a calculated race under Bailey. Raging Fever ran the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:43.57.</p>
        <p>As the field of 10 turned for home, the second choice, Ogden Phipps's Dancinginmydreams, veered to the outside and was pulled up by Pat Day. The filly, who had run first and second in her only two races and was considered highly promising, was found to have fractured a bone in her right hind leg. She was taken by ambulance back to the barn of her trainer, Shug McGaughey, and later to the University of Pennsylvania for surgery.</p>
        <p>Raging Fever scored by a length and three-quarters over Out of Sync, who had nearly two lengths on Western Justice, both trained by Zito for different owners.</p>
        <p>The $250,000 Forest Hills Handicap, a preview for the Breeders' Cup Sprint, toppled the odds when Delaware Township scored and Forest Camp and Kelly Kip did not. Delaware Township got there by a length and a half over Bevo to cover the six furlongs in 1:08.56, followed by Valiant Halory.</p>
