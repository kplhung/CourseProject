        <p>A summer that began with a National Basketball Association championship, and the expectations of heavy courtship and a big payday, quickly turned grim for Glen Rice.

        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers did not consider re-signing him. The richest team of the summer, the Orlando Magic, had him low on its list. Even the Chicago Bulls, who were shunned several times over by the top free agents, did not come calling until the market was all but bare.</p>

        <p>A summer that began with a National Basketball Association championship, and the expectations of heavy courtship and a big payday, quickly turned grim for Glen Rice. The respect that usually comes with winning a title never came and the long line of teams battling to sign one of the league's best shooters to a near maximum-level contract never materialized.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers did not consider re-signing him. The richest team of the summer, the Orlando Magic, had him low on its list. Even the Chicago Bulls, who were shunned several times over by the top free agents, did not come calling until the market was all but bare.</p>
        <p>The man who only four seasons ago outplayed everyone -- including Michael Jordan -- in the All-Star Game, who two seasons ago averaged 18 points in the playoffs, and who last season scored 20 or more points 28 times despite playing third fiddle to Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, was, to a large degree, unwanted.</p>
        <p>There was talk that at age 33 Rice had lost it, that he was no longer a big-time scorer. Now that he has joined the Knicks, the prevalence of that sentiment is what fuels Rice to work toward having a great season.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I have something to prove,'' said Rice, who has averaged 19 points in the Knicks' two preseason games. ''I hear a lot of things and that's O.K. That comes along with the game. Everyone needs that added edge to get going once again. I just role with the punches. I know what I have to do out here and given the opportunity, people will be saying, 'Hey, he still has it.' ''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the first thing Rice has to prove is that he is not a selfish player. For years, the slant on Rice has been that he puts his individual scoring figures above all else, and to many, his conduct during last season's finals confirmed that belief.</p>
        <p>While the Lakers were in the process of beating the Indiana Pacers for the championship, Rice caused a stir by voicing displeasure with his limited role in the offense. That has led to the speculation that he would not be content to be the Knicks' sixth man, but he has been a model teammate thus far.</p>
        <p>''Coming off the bench is no problem,'' Rice said after playing 27 minutes as a reserve in last Thursday's 91-83 victory over the 76ers. ''The main reason I'm here is to do whatever I can to get this team to the next level, whether it be coming off the bench or starting. I'm having fun and I'm happy to be here.''</p>
        <p>Rice's willingness to accept a reserve role has by no means decreased his expectations. Just last week he spoke of earning his fourth trip to the All-Star Game.</p>
        <p>The Knicks also have great expectations for Rice, as evidenced by their willingness to give him a four-year, $36 million contract. They coveted Rice all summer and worked tirelessly to pull off last month's four-team deal that brought him to New York in a sign-and-trade and sent Patrick Ewing to Seattle.</p>
        <p>Like Rice, the Knicks believe his decreased production in Los Angeles was due more to his situation than to his skills. Rice is at his best offensively when shooting jumpers off screens and posting up. But in Coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense, those options were not made available to him. Few plays were run for Rice and, with O'Neal on the block, he seldom posted up.</p>
        <p>For the most part, Rice was left to wander around the 3-point line, waiting for O'Neal or someone else to toss him the ball. He was given the role of Steve Kerr or John Paxson in the old Bulls offense.</p>
        <p>''The biggest question over the last two years has been: 'Is he getting too old; has he lost it?' '' said Rice, who last season shot a career-low 43 percent and averaged 15.9 points, the lowest since his rookie year. ''No, I haven't lost it. If you're true to the game and you really look back and see the circumstances I was in, then you'll know why my role on the offensive end has diminished.''</p>
        <p>As much as the Knicks will need Rice to score, they are just as concerned about his defense. He has never been regarded as a good defender but, in attempting to hush his critics, Rice has given heightened attention to his role on that end of the floor since joining the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I've watched New York over the years, and I realize that the No. 1 thing they're trying to do is be very aggressive on the defensive end,'' Rice said. ''I knew coming in here that that was one of the things I'd have to buckle down on and be focused on, and from Day 1, I've really tried to do what I've been asked to do.</p>
        <p>''But I really don't understand why people think I can't play defense. It hasn't been like I've been getting lit up year after year. I guess maybe because my offense overshadows it so greatly. But I can play defense.''</p>
        <p>That is just one more thing Rice will have to prove before the teams that bypassed him last summer regret their decision.</p>
