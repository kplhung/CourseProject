        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding the article ''Keeping the Day Job While Still Heeding the Call of the Stage'' on Oct. 1: As a fulltime teacher and active participant in Westchester community theater for the past 26 years and as president of the Greenville Community Theater, my interest in the article was dampened by the omission of our organization.</p>
        <p>Founded 35 years ago, Scarsdale-based Greenville Community Theater is dedicated to presenting high-quality productions to local audiences. In addition to the two fully staged shows presented each year, we are the only community theater to offer free monthly workshops. These encourage members to hone their skills as actors or directors in the presentation of scenes, one-act plays, experimental theater or original material such as Bruce Bloom's ''Best Meal I Ever Ate," which premiered at a G.C.T. workshop and is currently being produced around the county.</p>
        <p>With an enrollment of over 175 members, (including a surgeon, a dentist, an architect and a board of 25 people), G.C.T. prides itself on being able to fill all the on-stage and backstage positions with volunteers.</p>
        <p>Our November production will be Neil Simon's ''Fools,'' and we will celebrate our 35th anniversary next Wednesday at the Larchmont Yacht Club. Readers can find out about all this and more by visiting us on our Web site, www.members.aol .com/GrComThe. Readers may also contact Greenville Community Theater by calling the publicity chairwoman, Pat Grabel, at (914) 723-8625.</p>
