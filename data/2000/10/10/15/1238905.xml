        <p>FOR the first time in its history, Yale University is opening up its campus to the public, holding an all-day open house next Saturday to kick off the celebration of its 300th birthday next year.</p>
        <p>Participants will be able to see a rehearsal at the Yale Repertory Theater, attend a seminar by the famed architecture historian Vincent Scully, and visit the Beinecke Rare Book Library, where a Gutenberg Bible is on display. Visitors will also be able to walk into dormitories, have coffee at the campus's private dining club, Mory's, and even go where most students have never been: into the boardroom where the university's trustees make Yale policy.</p>
        <p>''Yale's architecture, much of the central campus is turned inward,'' said Richard C. Levin, the president of Yale. ''We have residential colleges with central courtyards, and gateways to the outside world that are locked. By opening up the great courtyards and inviting people in to the insides of our science laboratories and teaching facilities, it will give the public a chance to satisfy their curiosity.''</p>
        <p>The event will be held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Doors will be open to the arts and sciences, to music and medicine, to the president's office, to sports and the university's libraries. Yale said it hopes to give visitors insight into how it trains actors (Jodie Foster, Paul Newman and Meryl Streep are alumni); what goes into choosing a college; what happens in the chemistry lab and the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory, which has a nuclear accelerator.</p>
        <p>The Peabody Museum of Natural History  will conduct a behind-the-scenes tour of the  hidden collections of 11 million specimens, a showcase of life on earth, from the time of the earliest dinosaurs. Thirty-minute tours will run between 10:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. There will be a limit of 12 visitors per tour.</p>
        <p>The Yale Center for British Art will be open, with refreshments, tours of current exhibits and a behind-the-scenes view of the Conservation Department and of the Founder's Room, a treasury of Paul Mellon's gifts. Local church groups will join Yale singers in ''a teaching workshop on New England psalm singing.''</p>
        <p>(In another musical event marking Yale's 300th birthday, a concert by the New Haven Symphony orchestra on Thursday will feature a piano performance by Robert Blocker, dean of the Yale School of Music. Article, page 4.)</p>
        <p>The Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies will welcome visitors to historic Marsh Hall on Prospect Street for conversations with students about environmental issues.</p>
        <p>In a rare view of robotic technology, Yale's Intelligent Sensors Laboratory, directed by Prof. Roman Kuc, will demonstrate robotic sensors that are useful as travel aids to the handicapped and in manufacturing.</p>
        <p>The Yale Law School will hold a discussion of ''Leadership for the Next Century: Yale Parents' Perspective,'' by the parents of current students: George E. Pataki, governor of New York; Ellen Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural History; and Geoffrey Boisi, vice chairman of international banking at Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>There will also be workshops for children in the language and music of other cultures. The film ''Amistad'' will be shown, with a discussion of the movie with Yale faculty. The Divinity School will hold a research demonstration on ''The Bible and the Internet,'' and David Swensen, Yale's chief investment officer, will talk about how he manages Yale's endowment.</p>
        <p>All day's events are listed and described in a program that is available on the Internet. The program, maps, an architectural treasure hunt brochure, and other information will be available Saturday aat Yale's Visitors Center at Phelps Gateway on College Street, and at six other campus sites.</p>
        <p>Martha Highsmith, events coordinator and Yale's deputy secretary, said refreshments would be available at different places, including in a tent on Cross Campus and at some of the residential colleges.</p>
        <p>Visitors wearing a Yale 300 pin, obtainable on campus, will get free admission to the afternoon's Yale-University of Pennsylvania game at the Yale Bowl. New Haven's retail shops, within walking distance of the campus, will offer discounts. Seventeen New Haven restaurants and Yale Dining Services will provide specialties on Wall Street. For the evening, the Yale Jazz Ensemble, Yale Glee Club and Yale Symphony Orchestra will perform in Woolsey Hall.</p>
        <p>''We really want an opportunity to invite the people from the region and the city to see what Yale is and to say thank you,'' said Linda Koch Lorimer, the vice president and secretary of Yale. ''We really wish people will get into their cars and come here. This will be better than the state fair.''</p>
        <p>Information: (203) 432-0300, or at the university's Web site for the event, www.yale.edu/yale300. The site includes directions to Yale and the locations of parking lots, where shuttle buses will pick up visitors.</p>
