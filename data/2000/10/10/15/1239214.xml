        <p>Mets General Manager Steve Phillips echoed Manager Bobby Valentine's hope that Valentine will have a new Mets contract shortly after the season ends.</p>
        <p>Phillips said yesterday that he would negotiate that deal once he gets his own new contract, which seems to be a formality.</p>
        <p>''In reality, our No. 1 priority, once I get my deal done, will be to sign Bobby to a contract that's satisfactory to both parties,'' said Phillips, who has been told by the owners Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon that they want him and Valentine back.</p>
