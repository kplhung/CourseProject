        <p>THE Joan Baez who will be performing this Tuesday at the Community Theater in Morristown, is very different than the 1960's model. This millennial version is a more mellowed rendition of the former firebrand.</p>
        <p>Regarded as the queen of folk music (to Bob Dylan's king), Ms. Baez, 59, has been a political activist most of her life, and not surprisingly she still seeks peace. But now it's a personal inner peace. She's already done her fair share of work to save the world.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baez is attempting to simplify her life, and if that means attending fewer rallies, decreasing her benefit-performance schedule and making fewer speeches, that's fine with her. ''I need to get past the myth of being Joan Baez,'' she said in a recent conversation, ''and learn to enjoy my life.</p>
        <p>''I don't need to talk about politics and be there physically at benefits all the time. I realized that after all these years of being politically active, when I walk out on stage, 30 or 40 years of history walks out with me. My political and social context is already arranged for me. I am making a political statement by just walking out there. I may not be there at rallies, but I am a walking reminder that the stuggle goes on.''</p>
        <p>While her public political appearances have dwindled, she remains devoted to causes like non-violence and opposition to the death penalty.</p>
        <p>''In the early days,'' she recalled, ''there was a focal point -- civil rights, the Vietnam War. Today, there isn't much finger-pointing. There isn't a topical atmosphere or causes that approach those of the 60's.''</p>
        <p>Nowadays, she just wants to have fun, carry a lighter load and hang out with the new generation of folksingers.</p>
        <p>In the 60's, she was the foremost interpreter for up-and-coming songwriters like Mr. Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Phil Ochs. She continues that commitment by singing songs written by the new crop of folkies like Richard Shindell, Sinead Lohan and Dar Williams. ''I'm touched by their music, although I don't always understand what the songs mean right away,'' said Ms. Baez, the singer who introduced Mr. Dylan's cryptic canon.</p>
        <p>While she acknowledged that it is difficult to compare the new writers with the likes of a Dylan, she said that the contemporary folkies offer a different sense of excitement for her.</p>
        <p>''It's called evolution, starting with the Indigo Girls and Mary Chapin to people like Dar and Richard, the songs that I'm singing today would be anthems in another time. My job is to find what reflects today, and, of course, choose music that I can sing.''</p>
        <p>Even Ms. Baez's voice and phrasing have changed, becoming more subtle, even grittier. Known for her almost operatic soprano, she has found a warmer tone in recent years. The opening cut of her latest recording, ''Gone From Danger,'' is almost unrecognizable as a Joan Baez song, sounding like it could have easily been influenced by the voice and phrasing of Lucy Kaplansky, a distinctive contemporary singer-songwriter. Ms. Baez credits her new lifestyle for ''loosening'' her voice.</p>
        <p>Why the changes? ''Life for me has become more personal,'' she said. ''I found a wonderful therapy that took me apart and put me back together again, instead of gluing me together in the wrong shape.''</p>
        <p>She also enjoys touring and relishes the energy she gets from younger aquaintances with whom she shares stages (she's on tour with Stacy Earle, Steve Earle's sister) and whose songs she records. She also is equally energized by the younger fans who attend her concerts.</p>
        <p>''I'm doing a lot of touring and I am happy to announce that for the first time in my life I enjoy it,'' said the singer who has performed throughout the world for over four decades. ''I was so preoccupied with politics then.</p>
        <p>''And I was highly neurotic,'' she added, with a laugh. ''All of the stuff, the talking the shouting, I got rid of 12 years ago. At 48, I began to get the demons out. I am not the person I was then. I didn't have much fun.''</p>
        <p>Now, the once politically correct singer quotes from ''South Park,'' in conversation.</p>
        <p>Don't get her wrong, though. ''I'm glad for everything I did back then,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On her current domestic tour she performs her classics with material from her new album. ''There are lots of old songs mixed in with the new,'' she said. ''My job is to make it interesting.''</p>
        <p>She can still draw an audience, and she marvelled at the crowd of 50,000 who recently attended a performance in France, especially the younger fans who rushed the stage.</p>
        <p>Regarded by many as an icon, Ms. Baez defined a generation. But she's not ready to let that myth rest.</p>
        <p>''I still haven't reached where I want to be,'' she said.</p>
        <p>JOAN BAEZ  Community Theater of Morristown, 100 South Street, Morristown.  Tuesday at 8 p.m.  (973) 539-0345.</p>
