        <p>Manhattan impresses with its skyline, but it reveals its secrets only to those who walk its streets. And John Tauranac is a man from whom Manhattan has little to hide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauranac, creator of the wonderfully lucid New York City subway map, has come up with ''Manhattan Block by Block'' (Tauranac Maps, $14.95). The book is a street-level guide to the borough that points out landmarks like museums, hotels, Broadway theaters, playgrounds, schools, hospitals, parking garages and movie theaters.</p>
        <p>Street numbers are listed for all of Manhattan -- broken down on 94 pages of maps. The book also has citywide subway maps, a Manhattan bus map, and highway and commuter-rail maps. For some light reading among the cartography, Mr. Tauranac has written chapters on the history of Manhattan's street grid and guides to its neighborhoods. The 172-page book, in a pocket-friendly 3 1/4-by-9-inch format, is a result of over three years of walking streets (or, in the case of highways and bridges, riding in a car). ''Manhattan Block by Block,'' distributed by Larry Winderbaum Inc., (212) 481-1588, is sold at bookstores, map stores and other outlets.</p>
