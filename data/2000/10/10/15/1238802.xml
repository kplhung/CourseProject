        <p>AS temperatures drop in much of the United States, travelers' daydreams may turn to Mexico. Its warm climate, relaxed pace, miles of beaches and value continue to attract visitors from the north; the Mexico-United States border is one of the busiest in the world.</p>
        <p>Yet despite friendly relations and ease of access, travelers to Mexico need to remember that they are entering a foreign country. Visitors require proof of citizenship: a valid passport or birth certificate (or certified copy) is best, although pedestrian day-trippers crossing at the San Ysidro border near San Diego can get by with a California driver's license.</p>

        <p>AS temperatures drop in much of the United States, travelers' daydreams may turn to Mexico. Its warm climate, relaxed pace, miles of beaches and value continue to attract visitors from the north; the Mexico-United States border is one of the busiest in the world.</p>
        <p>Yet despite friendly relations and ease of access, travelers to Mexico need to remember that they are entering a foreign country. Visitors require proof of citizenship: a valid passport or birth certificate (or certified copy) is best, although pedestrian day-trippers crossing at the San Ysidro border near San Diego can get by with a California driver's license.</p>
        <p>When in Mexico, you should carry a copy of your birth certificate or passport identification page. Naturalized United States citizens should carry their naturalization certificate numbers. Minors (under 18) traveling without their parents must show proof of citizenship and a notarized, signed letter of consent from both parents; a minor accompanied by one parent must have a notarized, signed letter of consent from the other parent, or divorce, death certificate or guardianship papers.</p>
        <p>Since July 1, 1999, Mexico has required an entry fee (about $18, at 9.45 pesos to the dollar) for those who wish to travel farther than 16 miles from the border (in Baja, as far as Ensenada or San Felipe, and in Sonora, as far as Puerto Penasco), or stay more than three days. This fee is included in the air fare of flights into Mexico.</p>
        <p>For those driving or walking into Mexico, a tourist card must be obtained at a Mexican immigration office at the border. The entry fee (for the card) must be paid at a bank, usually nearby, where the card is stamped ''paid.'' The card must then be taken back to the immigration office for validation. If no nearby bank is open, the immigration office can stamp it pending payment and final validation, which must be within a day or two. It allows travelers to stay up to 180 days; it's useful to make a copy of the permit.</p>
        <p>Auto Insurance</p>
        <p>Anyone wishing to take a car across the border must have a valid driver's license from his country as well as insurance with a Mexican company. Many insurance offices  along the United States side of the border sell this. AAA members can buy Mexican auto insurance in border states. You can also shop online, where a range of agencies provide quotes and rates and will fax or mail a policy to you. One company, Bajabound (www.bajabound.com), lets you print out the policy.</p>
        <p>Besides simple liability coverage (usually about $10 a day, with a deductible of $500 to $1,000), you can buy additional coverage for legal  and/or medical services, theft and personal liability. A useful Web site, www.mexonline.com, lets you search for online insurance companies and law firms.</p>
        <p>Some car rental companies (Hertz, Dollar and Avis among them) allow their cars into Mexico, though you must buy Mexican insurance at the counter. There may be limits on which models you can rent and how far you can go. Within Mexico, the same companies have offices in larger cities and at major airports, and fewer restrictions.</p>
        <p>Using travelocity.com, I found these prices to be surprisingly competitive. For instance, at the Tijuana or Acapulco airports, an economy two-door manual model from Avis, without air-conditioning but with unlimited mileage, and including the mandatory Mexican liability insurance, was quoted at $149 a week plus 10 percent tax. Some companies require collision-damage-waiver insurance as well, covering the rental car, although this is included when you use many major credit cards.</p>
        <p>To take your own vehicle into Mexico and go outside the 16-mile border area or beyond the Baja peninsula or Sonora free trade zone, you must go to Mexican customs at the border and present an original, plus one copy, of the following: proof of citizenship, your tourist permit, a valid vehicle registration or title in the driver's name (or a leasing contract in the name of the person driving the car), a valid driver's license and an international credit card in the driver's name. (An effort last year to require a hefty deposit, of up to $800, for vehicles driven into Mexico was suspended in January.)</p>
        <p>Your credit card will be charged the equivalent of $10 and you'll be issued a temporary (180 days) importation permit. (Those without a credit card must post a sizable  bond.) Do not leave the permit in the glove compartment, and on leaving Mexico have it canceled at customs. A separate permit and ownership is necessary for each vehicle; for instance, in the case of an RV carrying  a motorcycle, each vehicle must be registered to a different owner, and each must be present and provide documentation.</p>
        <p>The Tangle of Accidents</p>
        <p>Try to avoid, at all costs, having a road accident in Mexico. As in the United States, they can be treated as criminal cases if there is injury, death, significant property damage, or evidence of drugs or alcohol. The drivers involved are likely to be detained until the charges and damages have been sorted out. Charges that may be applied include imprudence, a kind of criminal negligence.</p>
        <p>A representative of the public prosecutor's office will come to the scene and ask the drivers for statements. Although not required, it is considered useful to do so; you have the right to have a person you trust -- a friend, relative, lawyer, or even someone from the American Consulate, should you request it -- present while you are questioned. If there is only property damage, the police may ask the parties to negotiate a settlement, in which case they all sign an agreement (be sure to contact your insurance company first; the larger agencies have 24-hour hot lines with adjusters who speak English) and the vehicles are released.</p>
        <p>Even if no agreement is reached, arrests are rare in property damage cases unless it appears that alcohol, drugs or reckless driving are involved. The penal code provides that a valid Mexican insurance policy will guarantee bail in cases where the charge is negligence or imprudence; however, additional charges of excessive speeding or driving under the influence may not allow for release. Bail is paid to a court official, never to a police officer.</p>
        <p>If no agreement is reached, or if there are injuries, your vehicle may be impounded for as long as the investigation lasts, even if you feel the accident was not your fault. But sometimes you can post a bond, which may be covered by your Mexican insurance. In any case, you must report any accident to your insurance company's claims office before leaving Mexico.</p>
        <p>To avoid these problems, drive defensively, at or below the speed limit, in daytime, sober and where possible, on Mexico's expensive but high-quality toll roads and away from city traffic. Watch for extreme speed bumps, called topes, at the entry to towns, and keep an eye out for potholes. At stop signs, be generous with the right of way. To make a left turn on a busy two-lane highway with no left-turn lane, pull onto the right shoulder and wait for an opening.</p>
        <p>If you're lost in a larger town or city, the AAA advises hiring a taxi driver to lead you to your destination, settling the cost in advance. A red circle with a diagonal line across a large ''E'' means no parking. The word cuota designates a toll road.</p>
        <p>If the police issue you a ticket that you think you did not deserve, take the officer's name and number and ask to speak to the police chief or supervisor at the nearest police station. If this doesn't work, pay the ticket, on the spot if necessary, but if possible at a bank, getting a receipt; then register a complaint with the Secretariat of Tourism at (01-800) 903-9200 toll free, or, within Mexico City, (5) 250-0123 or (5) 250-0151. The secretariat also has a Web site, www.safeMexico.com, that provides safety tips and advice for specific cities and regions.</p>
        <p>Motorists in Mexico are fortunate to have the Green Angels, road patrols that help stranded vehicles. Their free services include emergency fuel, towing to a nearby garage, primary first aid, protection, mechanical repairs and tire changes; motorists pay for parts, gas and oil (tips are accepted). They can be enlisted by calling a toll-free number, (01-800) 903-9200; in case of a breakdown on a major highway, park completely on a shoulder, lift the hood and await a patrol; they cruise the highways frequently in marked green-and white trucks and in green uniforms.</p>
        <p>Those who would like to forgo responsibility for a vehicle might consider the Mexican bus system, which can be quite pleasant, though smoking is permitted. First- or deluxe-class buses usually have air-conditioning, reclining seats and footrests, restrooms, free snacks and beverages. Travelers going to out-of-the-way places may require second- or third-class buses, but there are very few villages not on some bus route.</p>
        <p>Ferries ply the Gulf of California between Baja and the mainland: from Santa Rosalia to Guaymas, and from La Paz to Topolobampo, and Mazatlan. Schedules and rates change frequently; call (01-800) 696-9600 within Mexico for information.</p>
        <p>The Secretariat of Tourism has  travel hot lines: (800) 446-3942 for the United States; (800) 482-9832 to the Mexico City office from the  United States; and within Mexico, (01-800) 903-9200.</p>
