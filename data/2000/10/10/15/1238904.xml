        <p>CONNECTICUT'S baby boomlet, which has resulted in 100,000 more school-aged children since 1990, has produced an obvious side effect that municipalities are struggling to reconcile: A soaring student population demanding increased classrooms and teachers at a price taxpayers are willing to pay.</p>
        <p>The issue is causing quite a commotion in Fairfield, where one plan to solve the overcrowding at the town's only high school would cost about $120 million, which would be one of the most expensive municipal school building projects in state history. The problem is so real, but the solution so costly, that town residents and officials have been locked in a battle over just how to proceed for four years. Town meetings have been raucous, tempers have been short and about the only thing anyone can agree on is that something has to be decided, and quickly.</p>
        <p>''We're taking the position that we'll support any of the scenarios,'' John Dorland, president of the Fairfield Education Association, said. ''But we've told the town officials they can't continue to fight among themselves. They need to reach a decision because the population is growing. We're going to be getting 90 more students a year for the next three years.''</p>
        <p>The town's only high school, Fairfield High, has 1,920 students, up from 1,600 in the 1980's. The town projects that it will have between 2,600 to 2,800 students by 2012. The school is already over capacity and five portable classrooms have been added to handle the overflow. Fairfield used to have two high schools, but the other one, Roger Ludlow, was closed in 1987 after enrollments had declined and turned into a middle school in 1995.</p>
        <p>One of the proposals officials are considering is expanding Fairfield High, turning Roger Ludlow back into a high school, and building a new middle school to handle the students displaced by the change. The problem is not only paying for renovating the older buildings, but finding land for the new middle school. This proposal would cost about $117 million, and that doesn't include the cost of acquiring the land for the middle school. The amount of money has staggered some residents.</p>
        <p>''Buildings never taught kids,'' said John Kankas, a member of the Fairfield Taxpayers Association. ''Education is interactive between teachers and students. The size of classrooms and their appearance have nothing to do with success. We have to stop the dreams of grandeur and building palaces.'' The high school issue is splitting the town into two camps that cross party lines, with Democrats and Republicans represented on both sides. One proposal calls for renovating Fairfield High School to hold 2,000 students in grades 10-12 students and the addition of a freshman campus for 800 students. But that plan, at an estimated $120 million, would cost even more than the first plan.</p>
        <p>A third option is for a single high school, an expanded Fairfield High, for 2,800 students, estimated to cost $114 million, although it includes a range of options that places the cost between $99 million to $130 million. The town, however, probably won't have to pay the full cost no matter which plan it chooses, because the state reimburses municipalities 28 percent of the cost, providing state guidelines are followed for the building projects. The town said it would sell bonds to pay for the rest.</p>
        <p>John Metsopoulos, the first selectman, said he supports the two high school plans.</p>
        <p>''The community clearly wants two high schools, and I believe very strongly in two high schools,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If that plan is approved, the next hurdle would be finding land for the new middle school. Three sites are under consideration, one of which may have to be taken by eminent domain, Mr. Metsopoulos said. The Bulkley family, which owns a 26-acre parcel on Mill Hill Road targeted as a primary site for the new school, prefers to sell the land for residential, but will not oppose a town takeover at fair market value, according to their lawyer, Arthur Williams. George Sturges, cochairman of the Mill Hill Improvement Association, said neighbors will sue, mostly because of increased traffic, if the town tries to build a middle school on the Bulkley property.</p>
        <p>At a recent school board meeting, one resident presented 375 e-mail messages from people favoring two high schools, but Joan Robb, a member of the Representative Town Meeting, countered with a list of 372 residents who favor one high school.</p>
        <p>Although the issue had been debated in the town for years, things started moving quickly about three weeks ago. The Board of Education voted in favor of the $117 million plan on Sept. 26. Two days later, the Board of Selectmen also gave its approval.</p>
        <p>Next up was the Board of Finance, but on Oct. 3 it rejected the proposal, on the basis that it contains too many unknown elements, particularly uncertainty over the cost and location of the proposed new middle school.  That has kicked it back to the Building Committee, which had come up with the proposal originally and forwarded it to the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>''It's a question of fairness and opportunity,'' said John Vazquez, chairman of the Building Committee. ''We've devoted four years to this project and developed three scenarios, all of them educationally sound. They should all go to the R.T.M'' for a vote. And even if the R.T.M. approves one of the options, residents can petition for a referendum.</p>
        <p>Money for the design of the other two scenarios has already been rejected by the R.T.M.</p>
        <p>''This is an issue that has divided our town. It's been dragging on, and I would like to see it reach consensus,'' said Ellery Plotkin, a Democrat who is a member of the R.T.M. and is running for state representative in the 134th District against Republican incumbent Jack Stone. Although Mr. Plotkin said he preferred the freshman campus and one high school option, he said he will consider the two high school option if it comes before the R.T.M.</p>
        <p>Cliff Freedman, a member of the Board of Education who favors the two high school plan, said he originally favored one high school, until he visited several of the freshman-only schools in the country and learned how unsatisfactory they are. Mr. Freedman said he believes smaller offers a more hospitable environment for students who would get lost in one ''mega high school.''</p>
        <p>Although she favors a one high school alternative, School Supt. Carol Harrington said all three scenarios are educationally sound.</p>
        <p>''It really is a community decision to be decided by the boards and commissions,'' she said. ''People are anxious to move on. I hope now we are able to bring the community to find a solution and reach closure.''</p>
        <p>But even when, or if, Fairfield comes together, it faces another issue. The town also needs to build a new elementary school because of rising enrollments, renovate its existing elementary schools and renovate Tomlinson Middle School. All together, that's about another $70 million. The school board is already meeting to work out the details.</p>
