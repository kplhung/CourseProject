        <p>THE trouble with autobiographical drama is that it is not always as interesting to a wide audience as it is to its author.</p>
        <p>That is certainly the case with a new play by Katharine Houghton,  ''Best Kept Secret, a Dangerous Liaison in the Cold War,'' though it does begin intriguingly enough before losing steam.</p>
        <p>Ms. Houghton, a playwright and actress, has written about her intermittent 30-year romance with a Russian. Ms. Houghton herself plays Katya, her stage persona, who falls in love with a somewhat mysterious engineering student named Andrei (Anthony Newfield) while visiting the Soviet Union in the summer of 1963. Andrei, who strenuously claims no involvement with the Communist Party, tells Katya that the KGB watches him constantly because, the police figure, he must be against the party. Andrei also tells Katya that he knows too much about the government's poisoning of the environment and, because she is an American, their romantic meetings might be construed as espionage. If she ever hears that he died by suicide, he tells her half-jokingly, don' believe it.</p>
        <p>One misleading thing about ''Best Kept Secret'' is its title, which suggests some degree of political intrigue. Indeed when Katya first meets Andrei, he is so charming and persistent that he instantly creates suspicion. When the play unfolds quite simply as a love story and nothing more, the stakes drop considerably.</p>
        <p>This is not to suggest that Ms. Houghton's love story cannot satisfy. On the contrary, ''Best Kept Secret'' does just that through Act I. After Katya returns home, it is natural to root for their reunion because you care about both characters. Katya is a fiery, smart and unpretentious character who won't even let her unspecified, ominous blood disease dent her spirit. Andrei is humorous, engaging and, most important, not threatened by Katya's willful independence.</p>
        <p>Act II is another story. After 25 years apart and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Katya returns to Andrei in Moscow. They become lovers, and Andrei instantly proves a bully. He insists on getting married, in a church no less. Katya jettisons her opposition to formal religion in the name of love, and off they hurry in search of a bribable priest and appropriate shoes.</p>
        <p>Then the play derails. After the plan to marry goes awry because of bureaucracy, the inexplicably frustrated Andrei takes out his anger on Katya and forces himself on her in a virtual rape, which, it must be emphasized, the director, John Going, stages tastefully. Katya greets this inexcusably violent act calmly. If the reason for Katya's reaction and easy decision to stay with Andrei rings clear in Ms. Houghton's heart and mind, she has yet to make it believable on stage.</p>
        <p>Ms. Houghton gives still more to ponder. Once Katya and Andrei commit to each other and move to New York, the play appears to be over. The conflict of Act I that kept the lovers apart no longer obstructs their union. Katya continues working in regional theater while Andrei teaches at various universities. The play continues, however, and the reason soon becomes as predictable as its conclusion.</p>
        <p>Ms. Houghton and Mr. Newfield are two talented, truthful actors who bring a humorous warmth to the performance. Ms. Houghton, who is best known as Katharine Hepburn's daughter in ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' and her real-life niece, shares a wonderful energy and tension with Mr. Newfield. And they splendidly handle the challenge of playing characters that are, for Act I, less than half their ages.</p>
        <p>The set's multilevel floor plan and unobtrusive panels designed by Joseph J. Egan, David Toser's costumes, David Pentz's lighting and Denise Eberly's sound make a most effective production design. The Schoolhouse even has new seats in its intimate, black box theater.</p>
        <p>''Best Kept Secret'' is a potentially good play. Ms. Houghton should keep working to smooth it out to achieve its full promise.</p>
        <p>''Best Kept Secret'' continues through Oct. 29 at The Schoolhouse, 1 Owens Road, Croton Falls. Tickets: $20 to $25. Box office: (914) 277-8477.</p>
