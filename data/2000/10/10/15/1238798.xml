        <p>Along with bungee jumping, spectacular scenery and friendly people, New Zealand now boasts a public bathroom on its list of tourist attractions.</p>
        <p>Friedensreich Hundertwasser, an Austrian-born artist, designed and oversaw the building of the town toilets in Kawakawa, the artist's adopted hometown on the North Island. He lived in New Zealand for 30 years before his death in February at the age of 71. The free-form cement building with its vaulted ceilings is a small gem of whimsical design.</p>
        <p>Straight lines were anathema to Hundertwasser, who was known internationally for his idiosyncratic designs and philosophy.</p>
        <p>This project, his last, has the feel of a loving community endeavor, and busloads of tourists now routinely stop to visit the ''loo in Kawakawa.''</p>
        <p>Squeezed in between two nondescript buildings on the rather scruffy main street, the toilet entrance resembles a Moorish fantasy with colorful bulbous towers, a sod roof, and columns fashioned from construction pipe and pottery.</p>
        <p>Inside, abstract patterns of bright tiles combine with light that sifts through hundreds of wine bottles, stacked sideways and set in the cement walls. Everywhere a visitor looks, there are charming sculptural details: a whale swims across a wall, a river of blue tiles leads to a floor drain.</p>
        <p>In the men's room each porcelain urinal is unique in design and size. There's a small, medium and large, each one mounted at an appropriate height against a wall of jagged black and white tiles.</p>
        <p>Tiles with male and female figures mark the entrances, but when a tour bus arrives it's not uncommon to find a group of men and women waiting to be told that the coast is clear so they can visit the other bathroom.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Hundertwasser's many friends in Kawakawa heard the news of his death, they paid tribute by adorning his final work of art with flowers.</p>
