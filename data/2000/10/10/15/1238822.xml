        <p>IT'S hard to imagine a location more conducive to chilly reflections on the aging of rock 'n' roll than this corner office high above the Sunset Strip.

But intimations of mortality are easily stirred in members of my graying generation by the fact that it is now necessary when mentioning a Dylan song to specify whether one means the work of Bob, Woodstock Nation's apocalyptic auteur, or of his youngest son, Jakob, the lead singer and Grammy-winning songwriter for the contemporary rock group the Wallflowers.</p>
        <p>That the younger Mr. Dylan was born in the Woodstock year itself, 1969, has not lessened those intimations. And he has a sense that can only be called familial for the dip or swivel of melody that will turn an image as simple as a single headlight into a provocative pronouncement -- as well as an ear for the cadence that lurks as its own song in the hearts of words like leopard skin, say, or Babylon.

        <p>IT'S hard to imagine a location more conducive to chilly reflections on the aging of rock 'n' roll than this corner office high above the Sunset Strip. There are the lightly misted views of Century City law offices and Beverly Hills verdure; the desk, barren of all implements except a long-barreled pair of binoculars; the brass and crystal reliquaries commemorating Jimmy Buffet tours. But intimations of mortality are easily stirred in members of my graying generation by the fact that it is now necessary when mentioning a Dylan song to specify whether one means the work of Bob, Woodstock Nation's apocalyptic auteur, or of his youngest son, Jakob, the lead singer and Grammy-winning songwriter for the contemporary rock group the Wallflowers.</p>
        <p>That the younger Mr. Dylan was born in the Woodstock year itself, 1969, has not lessened those intimations. And he has a sense that can only be called familial for the dip or swivel of melody that will turn an image as simple as a single headlight into a provocative pronouncement -- as well as an ear for the cadence that lurks as its own song in the hearts of words like leopard skin, say, or Babylon. What becomes evident in conversation is that Mr. Dylan, himself a father of three, is not without intimations of his own.</p>
        <p>Healthily lean as opposed to rock-star-skinny, he arrives for the interview in midnight-blue jeans that in their stiffness and stovepipe shape seem either to hark back to an era when denim still spelled solidarity with the working man or to speak to a cool present-day formality. In either case, they eschew any identification with the tatters, embroidery or flamboyant, distressed decades his father gave voice to. Mr. Dylan's manner, too, is upright, though good humored, even wry. There have been times, he allows, that he has had to remind nostalgic interviewers that he has a new record, ''Breach,'' the Wallflowers' first in four years.</p>
        <p>The multimillion-selling ''Bringing Down the Horse'' (1996) bristled with assurance, its hits like ''Sixth Avenue Heartache'' and ''Three Marlenas'' tangles of images whose propulsive melodies making the absence of narrative negligible. But ''Breach'' seems, oddly, the work of a younger man -- despite the gruff foghorn of his voice, which is eerily reminiscent of his father's. Certainly the arrangements are sparer, on occasion almost fresh-scrubbed, with a single guitar line edging toward styles that Mr. Dylan refers to as ''old school.'' (Given that the term is routinely applied to artists from the late 1980's, one might call Mr. Dylan's example, the Delta bluesman Mississippi John Hurt,  ''dawn-of-time school.'')</p>
        <p>And while the songs refrain from committing outright confession, many, like ''Hand Me Down'' or ''Baby Bird,'' open themselves to a personal reading. Perhaps it's simply that his images of vulnerability are often youthful -- ''those days before I met you, girl, were just like ice cream falling down on the shoes of my world'' --  or that the agonies of self-identification are not the sole property of adolescence. They can be as easily engendered by sudden acclaim.</p>
        <p>The writing, he admits, did not come easily. ''Bringing Down the Horse'' was successful enough to keep Mr. Dylan and the rest of the Wallflowers -- Rami Jaffee, on keyboards, Greg Richling, on bass, Michael Ward, on guitar, and Mario Calire, on drums -- on the road for two and a half years. Having had the opposite experience in 1992, when their debut album, ''The Wallflowers, '' plagued by muddy vocals, slid rapidly out of sight, pulling their record contract with it, the group was in no mood to argue with momentum. But the long-running performance left Mr. Dylan feeling ''thoroughly unimpressed with myself.''</p>
        <p>''When you're in the middle of writing a song, you can come up with this whole web of stuff only you know how to get through,'' he said. ''That's very entertaining for me to do that. But two years later I have to sing the song, and I've forgotten how to get through the web, and it becomes frustrating. Like, how come I didn't know that the last verse is really the same as the second verse? If I have a point, maybe it should be simpler. Because if I no longer really understand what I'm talking about, I don't know how anybody else could.''</p>
        <p>His dissatisfaction went beyond nuts and bolts. The songwriters he speaks of admiringly are a diverse, not to mention grizzled, group: Tom Waits, Dan Penn, Lefty Frizzell. ''I felt a kind of connection to them,'' he said. ''I started to wonder if anybody was ever going to gather that from the songs I was writing -- because they felt very impersonal.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, his dissatisfaction stretched even further, to just what it was he thought he was doing. ''In one sense it's thrilling to hear your record just sold another million copies,'' he said. ''But what does that mean? You end up wrestling with it. You don't really know how to feel. Are there six million really smart, cool people buying records in America?'' Is it enough, in other words, for the son of a cultural radical to be a mass-market star?</p>
        <p>IF, by harnessing rock's driving wheel to a sense of moral outrage, Mr. Dylan's father could foment a revolution, it was in part because revolution was possible. In 1965, the year the elder Dylan himself hit the Top 10 with ''Like a Rolling Stone,'' teenagers were an under-developed country, presumed to have little more on their wish lists than woolly bully and a ticket to ride. The nation Jakob Dylan inhabits, by contrast, is one in which revolution is a fashion label, teenagers are a market force and socially conscious musicians find themselves fighting on the side of executives against starry-eyed supporters of Napster and other set-the-music-free delivery systems. It's hard to avoid the thought that at least some of the culpability for this evolution rests with me, my classmates and communards who insisted that revelation was a daily necessity -- like vitamins -- and endorsed the narrow-gauge attributes of Bohemian intellectual chic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dylan, who disarmingly proclaims that he never got in trouble growing up because he ''had nothing to rebel against,'' is not without spleen. ''I have drawn blood from the neckline when vampires were in fashion/  I'd even learn to cut my throat, if I thought I could fit in,'' he sings in the new album's ''I've Been Delivered.''  Nevertheless, he does not want to appear ungrateful. Midway through a complaint, he catches himself. ''I liked getting the Grammy more than not getting it,'' he said, grinning. ''Make that clear.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he could pinpoint the moment in his childhood when he became aware of how the world viewed his father, Mr. Dylan pulled up a screen of deflective wit:  ''Yeah. While promoting my last record. I really had no idea up till then. They sure kept it a secret around the house.''</p>
        <p>He was laughing, not bitter. Indeed, his memories of growing up are decidedly, well, bourgeois. He gestured toward the plate glass window. Out there, beneath the double rows of palms, fronds flexing smoothly like synchronized swimmers' legs, is the Beverly Hills bedroom in which he practiced guitar, watched over by posters of Britain's snaggletoothed punk prophets the Clash. (''I hated lessons. I didn't really know what I wanted to play.'') South toward the horizon is the private high school he attended (''Nothing to brag about. I didn't really have good grades, and my parents thought it would help.'')</p>
        <p>Music was a constant. ''Instruments were like furniture,'' he recalled. ''Everybody picked them up.'' He is, however, the only one of his four siblings to make it a career.</p>
        <p>''Obviously,'' he said, ''I knew it would be -- regardless of who I am -- incredibly risky.''</p>
        <p>In a move that should reassure parents everywhere that higher education can be productive even when it is not exactly successful, Mr. Dylan left home in 1988 to attend the Parsons School of Design in Manhattan. He calls it his ''final attempt at wishing there was something that I would want to do'' besides music, and the effect was clarifying.</p>
        <p>''The first day I showed up I realized this was not going to work,'' he said. ''I didn't even bring the right tools to class. Everybody else did.'' He maintained the fiction of enrollment for a few months, relishing being on his own in Greenwich Village. Then he went home and began putting together the band that would become the Wallflowers.</p>
        <p>His habit of self-deprecation seems both genuine and politic, the protective coloration of a man who has seen celebrity from too many vantage points to ever stop listening for the rattle in its tail. A refrain from ''Breach'' speaks with a sigh of relief of ''looking up from under Babylon.'' It's the kind of relief most evident to people who have endured the waspish scrutiny of the tower suites. And it was, he thinks now, the experience of that scrutiny that led him ''to attempt something that was probably impossible'' when ''Bringing Down the Horse'' was released four years ago: ''To go out and promote a record and tour and at the same time remain anonymous in some way.''</p>
        <p>His reserve, of course, only brought more insistent attention. He was, he said, ''accused of being aloof and grumpy.'' But some of the desire to hold himself apart was instinctive. ''When I had grown up,'' he said,  ''there was a lot about: 'We're not a celebrity family, we're not available. People want to know those things, you walk away.' So when I started doing this myself, somehow I convinced myself that I could still maintain the anonymity. Only recently I've thought, Maybe that's why I look so detached, because I thought like actually I wasn't there.''</p>
        <p>It's hard to know if the glass walls of celebrity -- whether earned or inherited -- protect more than they expose, or vice versa. Mr. Dylan himself seems ambivalent when he returns, more seriously, to the question of when he first understood that his father was famous.</p>
        <p>''I think I was always aware,'' he said. ''More than anything I remember the way people reacted when they were around him. Most kids think their parents are really fantastic, so it made perfect sense. But as I got older, watching musicians who were my heroes, guys who are very cool, very tough, literally sweating and shaking to be around him -- I imagine that effect is everlasting. The moment kind of gets stolen, of allowing your heroes to be larger than life.''</p>
        <p>He was 12 at the time, and tough and cool were self-evident virtues. At 30, the limitation they impose, the detachment, is evident as well. With ''Breach'' he has made an effort to drop some of the protective glass, to invite rather than ward off speculation. The effort may come to haunt him. Another tour, he says, may lead him to ''passionately dislike'' the songs. ''But that's better than feeling nothing.'' It's worthwhile contemplating the title. Although ''breach'' has Shakespearean echoes and military connotations, it is also what whales do. Rising out of the water, becoming visible, proving themselves warm-blooded, they assert that it is not only possible but necessary to show the glassy surface permeable, and know it from both sides.</p>
