        <p>''We don't react to day-to-day blips,'' said James Gorman, a Merrill Lynch sales chief. On ''Wall Street Week,'' Louis Rukeyser dismissed ''some renewed jitters in the wake of a blip in retail sales.''</p>
        <p>As a linguistic plunger, I invested heavily in blips two decades ago. ''Blip has good upside potential,'' it was noted in this space in 1982, when a White House spokesman shrugged off bad financial news with ''We had one bad blip today.'' Since then, the usage of this onomatopoeic word has soared as jargonauts in a variety of fields embraced it, and I remain bullish on blips because the word satisfies a need for ''sudden, minor shock; meaningless interruption.''</p>
        <p>The earliest senses were ''a quick blow, accompanied by a popping sound'' and ''a twitch.'' The Dictionary of American Regional English exhumed its origins: ''Brer Rabbit draw back wid his fis', he did,'' wrote Joel Chandler Harris in his 1880 Uncle Remus stories, ''en blip he tuck 'er side er de head.'' In 1894, Mark Twain in ''Tom Sawyer Abroad'' wrote, ''We took him a blip in the back and knocked him off.''</p>
        <p>Dashiell Hammett kept that sinister sense in his 1929 ''Maltese Falcon,'' introducing a verb form: ''You could have blipped them both.'' In our electronic age, blip overtook pip to mean ''a point of light on a radar screen to locate a searched-for object.'' On television and later computer screens, the noun denoted any sudden surge of sound or light, often caused by an electrical interruption. When this was done deliberately to expunge an expletive, it was called a bleep.</p>
        <p>Because the spot of light or pop of sound was tiny, the word soon connoted smallness or insignificance as the metaphor was extended.</p>
        <p>In the 2000 campaign, when George W. Bush used a vulgarity near an open mike, The Dallas Morning News noted the difference between a minor slip and a major blunder: ''Analysts differ over whether it is a soon-to-be-forgotten blip or a blooper with staying power.'' Electronic media that wanted to shield their listeners bleeped the blip.</p>
        <p>Do not sell this short word short, as it can be used to describe sudden, transitory moves in any direction. Diplomats have long found it a useful word to minimize troubling changes: commenting on reversals in peace negotiations in 1972, Henry Kissinger said there ''may be blips up and down.'' But dismissal as a blip can invite response from editorialists who deride attempts to play down major events. As Watergate scandals came to a head in 1974, The New York Times wrote about President Nixon, ''Can he really be so uncomprehending that he considers it, to use his word, a mere 'blip'?''</p>
        <p>Though some language mavens cautiously rate blip as a market outperformer, I'll still call it a buy.</p>
        <p>In a Persian Mirror</p>
        <p>''With words we govern men,'' said Benjamin Disraeli. To which we have a corollary: by proverbs we enliven copy. Adages never age.</p>
        <p>The insightful and gutsy reporting from Iran of Elaine Sciolino of The New York Times has led to a book, ''Persian Mirrors: The Elusive Face of Iran'' (Free Press, $26). Seemingly in passing, but actually to illuminate culture, she tosses in local proverbs.</p>
        <p>For decades, adage-trackers have sought the origin of what John F. Kennedy described only as an old saying: ''Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan.'' The earliest pre-Kennedy use we have found so far is in a 1951 film, ''The Desert Fox,'' spoken by a German general. But Sciolino cites a Persian proverb that suggests its source may be in folk wisdom from another land and an ancient time: ''Winners have large families, but losers are orphans.''</p>
        <p>She learned another saying from a filmmaker willing to discuss censorship while inside Iran, but never while abroad. Why, if Persians have the courage to complain of repression at home, are they reluctant to criticize the regime when abroad? ''As my father used to say, 'If your head breaks, it is better that it breaks in your own hat.' ''</p>
        <p>A third proverb strikes the Western ear as arcane, referring as it does to a flaky confection of crushed sesame seeds in honey, but might be the sort of wisdom to impart to political candidates lagging in public-opinion polls: ''Have patience, and I'll make halvah for you from unripe grapes.''</p>
        <p>Keep It Short</p>
        <p>''The use of short words is an art,'' writes Nat Bodian in the winter issue of Publishing Research Quarterly, published at Rutgers. ''It takes a bit of time to think them up,'' he tells us, ''but once you learn how to make your thoughts known in short words and to write with them, you will find that they work well and, as a whole, they tend to make good sense.''</p>
        <p>Why? ''Short words are sharp, clear and to the point,'' notes Nat. ''They spark the thoughts of those who read them, and they urge them to read on. They let you say what you want, and they leave no doubt as to what you mean. So try to find ways to write in short words when you speak of or deal with books.''</p>
        <p>His pick of best names for books? ''Gone With the Wind,'' ''The Joy of Sex,'' ''Live and Let Die,'' ''A House Is Not a Home,'' ''The Prince of Tides,'' ''The Way Things Ought to Be,'' ''The Cat in the Hat.''</p>
        <p>Do you go for that as I do? Let us pledge, then, to swap long words for short ones. At first, you may find it hard to join this cause, but it is not as hard as you may think to pick nouns that shine, to choose verbs that stun and to use fresh tropes that sing. The need is real and the good it will do will make your spouse proud and your work sell. No, the trend toward a taut style should not be scoffed at as just a blip -- you can bet your life it will last for years. Think of it: crisp talk warms hearts, and prose packed with punch is sure to make you stand out in a crowd. Give it a shot.</p>
