        <p>THIRTEEN months after she was admitted to New York United Hospital in Port Chester with West Nile virus, Danuta Trojanowska has finally been released.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska, 56, did not return home immediately, because she still needs rehabilitative care after such a long time in a hospital bed. Instead, she was transferred to the Burke Rehabilitation Hospital in White Plains, where she is receiving intensive physical therapy.</p>
        <p>But her release from the hospital on Oct. 6 appeared to mark the end of a long ordeal.</p>
        <p>''I am happy,'' she said in halting English on the telephone in her new room at Burke. ''There are many machines here to exercise and get stronger.'' Ms. Trojanowska, who worked as a housekeeper before her illness, was born in Poland and immigrated 18 years ago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska had recovered from the West Nile virus by last Christmas, but as an impoverished legal alien without a green card she was eligible only for Emergency Medicaid, which does not cover the acute rehabilitative care she needed to strengthen her atrophied muscles and leave the hospital. As a result, she became a virtual prisoner in her hospital bed.</p>
        <p>Tere Pettitt, the chief operating officer at New York United, said she had traveled to Washington to speak to aides in Congresswoman Nita Lowey's office in search of a solution to Ms. Trojanowska's plight. ''They were very nice, but there were so many branches of government involved there was nothing they could do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska's release became possible when Hangar Orthopedic Group, a Maryland-based company, heard about her plight in late September from news accounts and donated a pair of leg braces, worth between $5,000 and $6,000, which helped her to stand up, Ms. Pettitt said. With the braces, she was able to begin the rigorous acute rehabilitation at Burke. Burke was able to cover the cost of her care through a federal program called Hill-Burton, which provides health care to the indigent, said Claire Lamberti, a spokeswoman for the hospital.</p>
        <p>Doctors at Burke could not say how long Ms. Trojanowska would be there. But her sister, Barbara Glowacki, said she had raised a little more than $5,000 in contributions to help her take care of her sister, who will live with her in Port Chester when she is released. The contributors included local Poles who had read about Ms. Trojanowska's plight in Polish-language newspapers, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trojanowska came close to death during her first months at New York United last year. She remained on a respirator for two months, unable to move and scarcely conscious. ''She was really paralyzed for a while,'' said Cheryl Allaway, a physical therapy assistant who worked closely with Ms. Trojanowska throughout her time at the hospital.</p>
        <p>Her story helped to publicize the seriousness of the West Nile virus, which caused 7 deaths and 62 cases of encephalitis in the New York region last summer, including 9 cases and a death in Westchester. This year, 14 New York City residents became ill with the disease, and a New Jersey man died. There were no cases in Westchester.</p>
