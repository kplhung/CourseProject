        <p>HODGES - Kathleen. October 4. Died while brushing her teeth in her home in New York City of heart arrhythmia. She was 59 years old. Fiercely beloved mother of Jennifer Hodges of New York City and Bettina Hempel of Lausanne, Switzerland; sister to Edward DeMar and proud aunt to Julie, Beth and John; cherished daughter of the late Kathleen McHale and Edward DeMar. Kathleen grew up in Lordship, CT and attended Our Lady of Mercy-Lauralton Hall High School after which she moved to New York to receive a degree from Columbia Teachers College. She worked as a medical transcriptionist in many of New York's hospitals, most recently at Columbia-Presbyterian. Quirky, quiet, with a great oddball sense of humor, Kathy is deeply, inconsolably missed. She was buried on October 7 at the Oak Lawn Cemetery in Fairfield, CT. She is Happy. Contributions can be made to an endowed scholarship in her name that will benefit daughters of single mothers. Please contact Georgia in the development office of Lauralton Hall, (203) 877-2786, Ext. 29. God Bless Us All.</p>
