        <p>Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite Muslim guerrilla movement, appears to be playing a growing role in encouraging the Palestinian uprising against Israel in recent days.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah's television station here has been beaming constant exhortations from the group's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah -- including a call to stab Israelis to death -- along with footage of the rock throwing and shooting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>In the Gaza Strip, the Hezbollah flag, with its distinctive raised assault rifle, has become a regular feature of street demonstrations and is even sold at the Palestine Liberation Organization flag shop. In the West Bank town of Ramallah, protesters were heard in a chant, nearly rhyming in Arabic:</p>
        <p>''Hezbollah our beloved/Destroy, destroy Tel Aviv.''</p>
        <p>Closely coordinated with Iran, Hezbollah's strategy means that a new force -- an uncompromising one -- is moving into the struggle between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Particularly in the Gaza Strip, where Hamas and other Islamic fundamentalist groups have a strong base, that sentiment is likely to increase the challenges to the already eroding authority of Yasir Arafat.  But it is notable that it also has appeal in Ramallah, a more secular and sophisticated West Bank commercial center, many of whose residents have lived in America.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah's prestige is high among Palestinians, most of whom are Sunni Muslims, with some Christians, because the movement forced the withdrawal of Israel from southern Lebanon last May after 20 years of occupation and guerrilla attacks. And so it lays claim to the sole Arab victory in the long Middle East conflict. Hezbollah's status skyrocketed when, in the midst of the current round of bloody clashes, its guerrillas abducted three Israeli soldiers along the border, intending to swap them for prisoners in Israeli jails.</p>
        <p>The Hezbollah strategy was formed last summer, experts say, when, uncertain what to do after the Israeli withdrawal, Sheik Nasrallah and other leaders journeyed to Tehran for advice. Ali Khamenei, the Veleyet-e-Faqi, or chief religious guide, told the Hezbollah leaders that their role was to struggle for the Muslim liberation of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>At the time, it seemed a long-term goal, at best. But protests began after the visit by the right-wing Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon to the Old City site in Jerusalem that is held sacred by both Muslims and Jews. Mr. Sharon is a particularly despised figure among Arabs because of his role in the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and the subsequent massacres of Palestinians in refugee camps by his Christian militia allies. To Hezbollah, his visit, and the subsequent protests by Palestinians -- likened by some here to the intifada uprising of the late 1980's -- changed things dramatically.</p>
        <p>''Hezbollah's command believes the intifada has crossed the point of no return and not even Arafat would be able to suppress it altogether,'' Kassem Kassir wrote in the Beirut daily al-Mustaqbal in a column attributed to unidentified Hezbollah leaders. ''There may be short lulls, but they will not quench the flame.''</p>
        <p>The Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, consulted here this week with Sheik Nasrallah on their strategy. ''The issue of Jerusalem is not only important for the Palestinians, but all the Muslims of the world,'' Mr. Kharazi told reporters after the meeting. ''This indicates how deep the Israeli provocation was in its attack on Al Aksa Mosque.''</p>
        <p>The Iranian foreign minister also met with the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, who stopped here to inquire about the Israeli captives. Through Mr. Annan, Israel conveyed an undisclosed message about the hostages, and, in turn, Mr. Kharazi asked that a message be delivered warning against any retaliatory attack against Lebanon or Syria. ''Please convey this warning to Israel,'' he said, according to Beirut newspapers and IRNA, the official Iranian news agency. ''The counterreaction will be extremely violent, and no one will be able to stop Lebanon's Islamic resistance movement from retaliating.''</p>
        <p>At a rally a week and a half ago in Hezbollah's southern Beirut stronghold, Sheik Nasrallah urged the Palestinians to reach out and stab someone. ''If you don't have bullets, who among you doesn't have knives?'' the sheik said in the message that is now repeated in broadcasts. ''Hide the knife, and when he comes close to the enemy let him stab him. Let the stab be fatal.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the Hezbollah television station, Sheik Nasrallah has also been seen on the independent satellite television station al-Jazeera, broadcasting from Qatar, which is  viewed throughout the Arab world.</p>
        <p>''Nasrallah is addressing all Palestinians as 'holy war comrades-in-arms' and has directly proposed to them the strategy of gradually escalating the intifada weapons from stones to daggers and ultimately to firearms and other means of military combat,'' Mr. Kassir of al-Mustaqbal quoted senior Hezbollah commanders as saying. ''The party is extensively trying to find ways of sending arms to Fatah, to the police force as well as to Hamas and Islamic Jihad to keep the intifada afire.''</p>
        <p>Hezbollah's message comes at a point at which there appears to be growing alienation from Mr. Arafat among the younger street fighters of his own Al Fatah party. They are known as the Fatah Hawks or the Tanzim, meaning organization. Last Sunday, the Tanzim reportedly distributed an unauthorized leaflet declaring a ''popular war'' against Israel. The leaflet appeared to draw Mr. Arafat's younger fighters closer both to Hamas and to Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>''We are glad our brothers in Fatah have come to realize the enemy understands only the language of force,'' a Hamas official told the leftist daily Asharq, adding that they ''must emulate the Lebanese resistance.''</p>
