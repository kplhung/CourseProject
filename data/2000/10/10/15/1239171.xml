        <p>The probability of Rutgers Coach Terry Shea's being dismissed neared certainty tonight. The players' quitting on Shea appeared to be a done deal.</p>
        <p>The Scarlet Knights turned a lifeless first half into an entire game of misery, losing to Temple, 48-14, before 16,491 numb fans at Rutgers Stadium.</p>
        <p>Rutgers (2-4, 0-4 Big East) is now alone in last place in the Big East, and must win four of its final five games to salvage Shea's job. The school's athletic director, Robert E. Mulcahy III, has said that Shea, who is 10-40 in four-plus years at Rutgers, must have a winning record this season to stay on as coach.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to have to put the team in front of this,'' Shea said. ''This is about our team, it's not about Terry Shea. I'm really disappointed we didn't play better.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he or the players felt pressure to win, linebacker Torrance Heggie said: ''A little, because I like the coaches here and I want to see them stay. We have four more games to win.''</p>
        <p>The Knights have yet to play West Virginia, Notre Dame and Syracuse. Shea may want to polish his resume while devising a plan to keep the Scarlet Knights close in the first half of its remaining games. Two weeks ago Rutgers fell behind by 41 points in the first half before losing to Miami, 64-6.</p>
        <p>In the first half tonight, Rutgers surrendered 329 yards in offense to the Owls (4-3, 1-2) and fell behind by 24-7. Temple's Tanardo Sharps rushed for 143 of his 168 yards and scored two of his three touchdowns in the half.</p>
        <p>Rutgers rushed for 108 yards as a team for the game.</p>
        <p>''The big stat tonight was that we had 4 conversions out of 17 attempts on third and fourth down, and you're not going to win games that way,'' Shea said.</p>
        <p>Rutgers parlayed a botched Temple punt into a first-and-goal from the 5-yard line early in the third quarter, but three punchless runs and an incomplete pass left the Knights with nothing. The Owls scored 24 more consecutive points before Rutgers scored a touchdown with two minutes left.</p>
        <p>Temple seemed a realistic mark for the Knights. The Owls' previous three victories came against teams with a combined record of 2-15, and Rutgers quarterback Mike McMahon was returning after two weeks of resting a strained throwing shoulder.</p>
        <p>Jason Ohene's 39-yard touchdown run gave Rutgers a 7-3 lead late in the first quarter, but Temple, aided by two Rutgers fumbles, scored touchdowns on its next three possessions to bound ahead, 24-7. The lead could have been greater if the Owls' Cap Poklemba had not slapped his 26-yard field-goal attempt into the right upright with no time left in the half.</p>
        <p>McMahon completed 16 of 39 passes for 243 yards and a touchdown. He was intercepted once and was hurt by numerous drops. His best pass was a perfectly lofted ball that found Ohene on the run at the Temple 24. Rutgers was down by 10-7 at the time, but Ohene fumbled as he fell, and Temple's Terrance Leftwich pounced on the ball.</p>
        <p>A few players later, Temple wide receiver Greg Muckerson took a screen from quarterback Mike Frost and lofted a 39-yard completion to Terrence Stubbs, leaving just 8 yards for Sharps to cover on a touchdown sweep to make the score 17-7.</p>
        <p>Devin Scott, who stung Rutgers last season for a school-record six touchdown passes, completed 14 of 16 for 150 yards. Frost, the starter, was 6 of 15 for 65 yards.</p>
        <p>Rutgers will take a four-game losing streak to Navy (0-6) on Saturday. A victory might not save Shea's job, but it could restore a shred of optimism to the Knights' dismal season.</p>
        <p>''I'm just tired of losing,'' Ohene said.</p>
        <p>The losing ''breaks our spirit a little bit,'' Heggie agreed. ''We have Navy next.''</p>

        <p>Rowan Beats Cortland St.</p>
        <p>GLASSBORO, N.J., Oct. 14 (AP) -- Running backs Jason Frabasile and Kevin Sinclair each scored two touchdowns today as Rowan routed Cortland State, 45-10.</p>
        <p>Sinclair and Frabasile both scored in the first quarter and Nick Frade added a 30-yard field goal as Rowan went out to a 17-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Rowan (5-1, 3-0 New Jersey Athletic Conference) scored again early in the second quarter when quarterback Mike Warker hit Scott Lipford with an 8-yard touchdown pass. Cortland State (3-4, 3-2) got its only points in the second quarter on a 2-yard touchdown run by Jason Burch and a 36-yard field goal by Georg Oostmeyer. Rowan led, 24-10, at the half.</p>
