        <p>Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi has signed a two-year contract extension, assuring not only that one of the best team executives in the National Football League will remain with the franchise through at least the 2003 season, but also that Accorsi will decide the coaching future of Jim Fassel.</p>
        <p>An N.F.L. official familiar with his contract said Accorsi was now among the 10 highest-paid general managers in football that do not also hold coaching titles. Seattle's coach and general manager, Mike Holmgren, is believed to be the highest-paid team executive in the sport, earning $4 million a year.</p>

        <p>Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi has signed a two-year contract extension, assuring not only that one of the best team executives in the National Football League will remain with the franchise through at least the 2003 season, but also that Accorsi will decide the coaching future of Jim Fassel.</p>
        <p>An N.F.L. official familiar with his contract said Accorsi was now among the 10 highest-paid general managers in football that do not also hold coaching titles. Seattle's coach and general manager, Mike Holmgren, is believed to be the highest-paid team executive in the sport, earning $4 million a year.</p>
        <p>Accorsi declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The Giants are 4-2, their best start after six games in seven years. Since the 1970 merger, only four Giants teams have had better starts at this point in the season. They were the teams in 1993 (5-1), 1990 (6-0), 1989 (5-1) and 1986 (5-1).</p>
        <p>Accorsi reassembled the offensive line and signed quarterback Kerry Collins, two crucial ingredients to the Giants' winning record. Though the Giants lost two games to Washington and Tennessee, they have three winnable ones in a row against Dallas, Philadelphia and Cleveland, and could be 7-2 when they play St. Louis on Nov. 12.</p>
        <p>Accorsi actually signed the extension months ago, but the Giants, as happened with the contractual moves of Accorsi's predecessor, George Young, kept the new agreement a secret.</p>
        <p>The organization has been extremely pleased with Accorsi and believes he has been the perfect fit since Young, after 21 years and 2 Super Bowl championships, left the Giants to work in the league office almost three years ago. Many of Accorsi's competitors have the same respect for him.</p>
        <p>Accorsi's new contract will have serious ramifications for the future of the team. Last January, Fassel signed a one-year contract extension that takes him through next season. That means the Giants will probably evaluate Fassel again after the end of this season.</p>
        <p>Accorsi, as the general manager, would be the point man in that process. The owners, Wellington Mara and Bob Tisch, along with John Mara, the executive vice president and general counsel, would have the final say. But as what happened with Young, Accorsi would be afforded the most input.</p>
        <p>That is why Accorsi's extension is such important news. It gives him the clout to make any move he wants in regards to Fassel, who is 29-24-1 midway through his fourth season.</p>
        <p>Fassel is well liked by the organization, respected for his strong work ethic and loyal to the franchise. His relationship with Accorsi is cordial, but professional. It also bears watching.</p>
        <p>This is a critical year for Fassel. If the Giants make the postseason and then perform strongly, winning at least a first-round game, he would almost certainly be given another extension, possibly a multiyear deal. But if the team does not make the postseason or loses badly in the first round, there is a chance Fassel will be fired.</p>
        <p>For now that seems a distant concern. The Giants are not the Rams, but they are a solid playoff team. In fact, the only teams in a mediocre National Football Conference clearly better than the Giants are the Rams, Washington and Minnesota.</p>
        <p>So the Giants appear to be in good shape. Especially since the team has secured the services of Accorsi for at least a few more years.</p>
        <p>Dividends From Defense</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. is enjoying one of its most entertaining seasons in years, and the reason is because there are so many surprise teams. The common denominator among those clubs: defense.</p>
        <p>Defense is not as sexy as the St. Louis track-meet offense, but it is the reason a number of teams are playing well.</p>
        <p>1. The 5-1 Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins ended last season with a humiliating 62-7 playoff loss to Jacksonville. The belief among reporters and many in the N.F.L. was that after losing Coach Jimmy Johnson and quarterback Dan Marino to retirement, Miami was doomed to last place in the division. Instead, the Dolphins are at the top of the American Football Conference East because they allow only 8.5 points a game.</p>
        <p>2. The 5-0 Minnesota Vikings. One of that team's best decisions was bringing in Emmitt Thomas as defensive coordinator. His schemes, like moving the inside pass rusher John Randle to defensive end, have worked well.</p>
        <p>3. The 4-1 Oakland Raiders. The Raiders do not have spectacular statistics but are playing solid defense.</p>
        <p>4. The 5-1 Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens' defense leads the N.F.L. with 20 takeaways.</p>
        <p>Challenge of Realignment</p>
        <p>N.F.L. owners are finding that realigning the league will be one of the most distinctive challenges the sport has had in years.</p>
        <p>The reason is allegiances. Chicago wants to be in the same division with Green Bay, Buffalo with the Jets and Miami. Try to remove Dallas from the N.F.C. East, and Washington might object to losing one of its best rivals.</p>
        <p>The only certainty is that there will be eight four-team divisions once Houston begins play in 2002.</p>
        <p>Criticizing Sparks</p>
        <p>Cornerback Phillippi Sparks makes his return to Giants Stadium today, only now he is wearing a Dallas Cowboys uniform. Sparks played for the Giants from 1992 to 1999 and for most of his career was an extremely productive player.</p>
        <p>Yet he was not a favorite of teammates who viewed him as phony and selfish. Many in the organization were happy to see him go.</p>
        <p>But the off-the-record remarks made by the Giants in regard to Sparks last week were harsh. The team leaked several negative, though true, stories about Sparks's antics over the past few years to some in the local news media. Among those accusations were that Sparks disliked Kerry Collins because of the racial epithet Collins used to describe a former black Carolina Panthers teammate, and that Sparks constantly talked about retiring, lost his work ethic and was injury prone.</p>
        <p>How choreographed was the Giants' verbal attack on Sparks? The same phrase ''Fassel never forgot'' -- referring to Sparks's refusing to have his locker next to that of Collins, supposedly angering Fassel -- appeared on the same day this week in two New York-area newspapers.</p>
        <p>The problem is that when Sparks was with the Giants, no one on the coaching staff voiced his displeasure with Sparks to his face, according to current and former players.</p>
        <p>This off-the-field development is significant because it could have ramifications on the field.</p>
        <p>Sparks told at least one Dallas teammate last week that he had read the stories about himself and was extremely motivated because of them. How much that means no one knows, because Sparks has clearly lost a step.</p>
        <p>But what if Sparks does get two interceptions against his old team? Will the Giants' tactics have then backfired?</p>
        <p>One current Giants player, who did not particularly care for Sparks, nevertheless voiced concern about the entire episode. ''I wonder if the Giants will air my dirty laundry if I go to another team?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Around the League</p>
        <p>One byproduct of the Rams' success is that a number of teams with quarterback problems are seriously considering trading for St. Louis's backup, Trent Green, this off-season. But buyers beware: Green is 30 years old, has only 14 career starts and a quarterback rating of 81.7. . . . While the chances of a Subway Series remain alive, don't count on a Subway Super Bowl. According to the N.F.L., the Giants and the Jets have both made the playoffs in the same season only three times, in 1986, 1985 and 1981. . . . The N.F.L. trading deadline passed last week without a single deal and only a handful of substantive discussions. Agents want the deadline pushed back to late November or December. That won't happen anytime soon. Owners are too afraid of a baseball-type situation in which teams would trade players to dump their salaries.</p>
