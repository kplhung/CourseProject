        <p>Paul knew he'd be rich someday, not because he had driving ambition, but because his dad owned a large company that would one day be passed on to him and his siblings. Now 43, Paul works as a graphic designer for the company. He receives a salary of $90,000 a year and maintains a lifestyle that costs him $30,000 a month.</p>
        <p>Paul's father has always been a penny pincher, a guy who, despite his millions, wears an $18 Timex and buys on sale. He has never purchased expensive cars and only recently bought a second home. When he eats out, he always orders the cheapest thing on the menu (and insists that anyone he's paying for do the same). He reserves his big spending for causes he believes in. In 1995, he put $50 million of his personal savings in a charitable trust. At 85, he's proud to say that there's no difference between him and a regular guy, except that he doesn't have to live that way.</p>

        <p>Paul knew he'd be rich someday, not because he had driving ambition, but because his dad owned a large company that would one day be passed on to him and his siblings. Now 43, Paul works as a graphic designer for the company. He receives a salary of $90,000 a year and maintains a lifestyle that costs him $30,000 a month.</p>
        <p>Paul's father has always been a penny pincher, a guy who, despite his millions, wears an $18 Timex and buys on sale. He has never purchased expensive cars and only recently bought a second home. When he eats out, he always orders the cheapest thing on the menu (and insists that anyone he's paying for do the same). He reserves his big spending for causes he believes in. In 1995, he put $50 million of his personal savings in a charitable trust. At 85, he's proud to say that there's no difference between him and a regular guy, except that he doesn't have to live that way.</p>
        <p>All this has had an effect on Paul. He often feels bad about the luxuries in his life -- his four houses, his expensive cars, his lavish vacations. He says it's as if he has an angel on one shoulder telling him to live frugally</p>
        <p>while the devil on the other is urging him to buy the $15,000 Harley-Davidson on a whim.</p>
        <p>In the last six months, Paul admits, the devil has been winning out. Since March, he has purchased a two-room apartment in Manhattan for $400,000 and a 1,500-square-foot work studio in downtown Atlanta, also for $400,000. The place in New York came mostly furnished, but he had to start from scratch on the studio. So far he has stocked it with a $25,000 desk, $250,000 worth of art and a $17,000 couch. He also bought the house next door to his main residence when prospective buyers threatened to take back some of the yard the previous owners had shared with him.</p>
        <p>Paul puts in long days at his studio, which he says eases some of the guilt and anxiety he feels about his everyday spending. ''It makes me feel more deserving,'' he says. He has a personal trainer come to his house three times a week, at $70 a session, and visits from a masseuse, who also charges $70 an hour. He says the $250 in fresh flowers he has delivered to his house and office each week and his new $4,000 titanium bike make a big difference to his state of mind, too.</p>
        <p>He feels less sanguine about other expenditures, particularly the $13,000 a month he pays in alimony and child support. (The divorce itself cost $500,000 in legal fees, and Paul had to give his ex-wife a property-stock-cash settlement worth millions.) But Paul feels most anguished over what he spends on his kids. ''It's difficult saying no to them,'' he says. ''They get almost everything they want and don't appreciate any of it.'' As an example, Paul cites the $42,000 used Range Rover he just gave his daughter for her 16th birthday and his half of the $1,700 limousine ride she recently took to a Dave Matthews concert. ''The sad thing is, I'm contributing to this mind-set,'' Paul says. ''My daughter said she wasn't going to college because she'll be rich no matter what. When I stopped laughing I got really angry. I wanted to cut her off right there.''</p>
        <p>As he talks about his spending and his children's attitudes toward money, Paul is also acutely aware of his own father. ''Part of me is ashamed when people see my house, especially my dad,'' he says. ''I know he's disappointed, even disgusted. Part of me knows he's right.''</p>
