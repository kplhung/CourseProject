        <p>FOR 54 years, the village of Scarsdale took pains to keep its children's baseball programs from becoming too competitive.</p>
        <p>While youth leagues in surrounding towns were run by Little League, the nation's premier youth baseball organization, Scarsdale kept the group out. Little League, with its official uniforms, rule book and post-season playoffs, was too regimented and competitive for Scarsdale, where ambition and rivalry tend to creep into children's lives early enough anyway.</p>
        <p>Academic tracking, for example, is not allowed in the elementary schools and as for baseball leagues, there had long been rules requiring equal playing time for all children. Also, the league ran pre-season meetings to sensitize parents and coaches to the virtues of good sportsmanship, to refrain from screaming from the sidelines at children or at other parents and coaches.</p>
        <p>For years, all a child needed to play in Scarsdale's Rec League was a mitt and an elementary school T-Shirt, the same uniform worn in the village soccer league.</p>
        <p>Even when the village allowed Little League to run baseball, in 1998, the trustees rejected the standard Little League practice of dividing children into levels of play based on ability. Parents who wanted more hard core baseball -- night games, pennant races, manicured playing fields -- enlisted their children in Little League in nearby towns, including Eastchester, Harrison, Elmsford and Mamaroneck.</p>
        <p>But now, it seems, hardball has come to Scarsdale.</p>
        <p>After weeks of bitter debate and a volley of letters in the local paper, the Village Board voted last month to let the Little League separate players age 9 through 12 by their ability instead of by their school grade. For fire-ball pitchers and dashing shortstops there would be the major leagues. For the less gifted there would be the minors.</p>
        <p>So in February, two months before Opening Day, children trying for the majors must report to the Scarsdale High School gym and take batting practice at tennis balls tossed from 46 feet, to demonstrate their batting ability.</p>
        <p>Their foot speed and the strength and accuracy of their throwing arm will also be assessed by evaluators from outside the league and the village (to avoid accusations of favoritism).</p>
        <p>Less skilled players will go to the minors, but for those players making the majors, each will be graded from 1 to 10 and put into a ''draft'' by a computer, which forms teams of compatible skill levels.</p>
        <p>Many parents call all this ludicrous for children as young as third graders. Youth baseball, they argue, is about camaraderie, friendship and fun, not on-base percentages and, as one parent put it, ''feeder leagues for the high school team.''</p>
        <p>Over the summer, many urged the Village Board to hold off judging a child's athletic ability, at least until junior high school.</p>
        <p>''It's just become absurd,'' said Mark Gompertz, who has two sons who play in the league.</p>
        <p>''Why can't we just give them bats and balls and have pickup games like I used to?'' he said. ''Why tell a kid he's not good enough at that age? Why put them on the fast track? There'll be time for that. Don't do it now.''</p>
        <p>The issue has touched a nerve beyond the baseball diamond.</p>
        <p>''The guys on the train all talk about it in the morning,'' Mr. Gompertz said. ''I tell people at work, and they laugh and say, 'What? Over baseball?' But it has become this metaphor, as baseball often is, for life.</p>
        <p>''There are definitely some people in Scarsdale who, because of whatever position and wealth, feel a certain sense of entitlement. It's 'only the best for my child.' They want to start tracking them early, prepare them for life.''</p>
        <p>Adding a competitive element to baseball, Mayor E. Markham Bench said, only makes things tougher for Scarsdale children.</p>
        <p>''Between tutors and Kaplan courses and the pressure to make it into the right schools, it's kind of hard on them,'' he said. ''We don't want to exacerbate the competitive nature here with Little League.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mayor Bench said having a minor league will allow less skilled players to excel and not get cut from baseball altogether.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the skills-based program, too, argue that it will make the game better and safer, particularly for less athletic children.</p>
        <p>''If you're playing with kids at your level, at least you have a chance to hit and catch the ball,'' said Bill Liebman, a member of the Scarsdale Little League board. ''A kid is far happier hitting home runs than striking out three times a game.</p>
        <p>''If you've never gotten a hit or caught a ball the entire year, that can't be fun,'' he said, ''and you don't want a sixth grader throwing 60-mile fast balls to a hitter who is not as gifted.''</p>
        <p>League officials also say they favor the new format because it conforms to league standards nationwide, of which preseason drafts and inter-league championship play are staples.</p>
        <p>''For years, Scarsdale was low-key sandlot ball,'' said Mr. Liebman, whose 11-year-old son will be trying out for the majors. ''This sort of steps it up a notch.''</p>
        <p>The Little League president, Steve Nathanson, said the new format allows the league to play against other towns.</p>
        <p>In the previous one-league-for-all system, he said, the children with limited skills suffered. ''This gives them a chance to excel and play positions they otherwise wouldn't be able to.''</p>
        <p>He said the league would consider changing the names, away from majors and minors, ''just so there's no stigma attached.''</p>
        <p>Though Little League classifies players by age, Scarsdale long organized its Rec League teams by school grade and by neighborhood, to keep friends together. Some parents say the new format will upset this.</p>
        <p>Dick Schapiro, a member of the Scarsdale Athletic Association board, has an 8-year-old daughter who plays Little League. He said the community is concerned that the league would become ''a farm league for the high school teams.''</p>
        <p>''There is much more focus on putting a winning team on the field and much more of a competitive element in it that didn't exist before,'' he said, adding that intensive tryouts would discourage weaker players and drive them out of baseball sooner. ''It caters to better athletes at the expense of the vast majority of kids.''</p>
        <p>Kenneth Batchelor, the village's superintendent of Parks and Recreation, which ran the Rec League, said dividing players by ability has ''raised the intensity of baseball in Scarsdale.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I think we've taken it a little too far. We've elevated youth sports far beyond what it was ever intended to be.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Liebman says the skill-based format makes playing ''much more fun, and that's what it's there for.''</p>
        <p>He added that it is also a reflection of a community where children who make travel teams proudly parade their fancy team jackets at school.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough town, and a lot of people are very successful at what they do and don't want their kid to not be successful,'' he said. ''In athletics, parents are more nervous how their kid is viewed because it's a very public thing. Your son is the shortstop and the ball is hit to him, you get that feeling in the pit of your stomach, you hope he makes it, not because you're living vicariously through him, but because you want him to feel good.''</p>
        <p>The village resisted Little League running baseball because, Mr. Liebman said: ''For a long time, Scarsdale did not want to be told what to do. They understand we're not producing any Major Leaguers and they made it less competitive.''</p>
        <p>But Alan Wachtel, a psychiatrist who has two sons in Little League, said Scarsdale's longstanding philosophy of inclusion allowed it to keep young players from quitting out of discouragement. The ability-based format also discourages late bloomers, he said.</p>
        <p>''It tracks them in a negative way and hurts their self-esteem,'' he said. ''Even the ones who make it get a funny message. It teaches the kids a different set of values. I mean, come on: is Scarsdale going to be producing Major League ball players?''</p>
        <p>The new system will ''bring in elitism by creating an upper class of kids,'' said Alan Margolin, the former president of the Scarsdale Little League. ''But an underclass of kids are left behind and feeling bad.''</p>
