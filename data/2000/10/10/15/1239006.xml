        <p>. . . And Still Champion</p>
        <p>Q.: In the 1940's, the boxer Jack Dempsey had a restaurant on Broadway between West 49th and West 50th Streets. Behind the bar was a large mural of Dempsey's third-round knockout of Jess Willard on July 4, 1919. What happened to the painting?</p>
        <p>A.: When Jack Dempsey's Restaurant closed its doors in 1974, the former champion and his wife donated the mural to the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington. According to Fred Voss, a senior historian at the Smithsonian, the 6-by-18-foot oil has dominated the first-floor gallery devoted to sports figures ever since.</p>

        <p>. . . And Still Champion</p>
        <p>Q.: In the 1940's, the boxer Jack Dempsey had a restaurant on Broadway between West 49th and West 50th Streets. Behind the bar was a large mural of Dempsey's third-round knockout of Jess Willard on July 4, 1919. What happened to the painting?</p>
        <p>A.: When Jack Dempsey's Restaurant closed its doors in 1974, the former champion and his wife donated the mural to the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington. According to Fred Voss, a senior historian at the Smithsonian, the 6-by-18-foot oil has dominated the first-floor gallery devoted to sports figures ever since.</p>
        <p>''When it came to us it was very brown,'' Mr. Voss said. ''I suppose it was from the cigar and cigarette smoke.''</p>
        <p>The painting, commissioned by Mr. Dempsey himself, was unveiled in 1944, 25 years after the famous knockout in Toledo, Ohio, gained him the heavyweight crown. It was painted by James Montgomery Flagg, who was known for the scowling, finger-pointing Uncle Sam in his Army recruiting posters during World War I. In addition to the fighters, Mr. Flagg -- who worked from photographs taken at the bout -- painted some famous public figures among the onlookers, including Rube Goldberg, Damon Runyon and Max Baer. Mr. Dempsey paid him $12,500.</p>
        <p>Jack Dempsey's Restaurant, which closed after the owners lost a  legal dispute over the terms of the lease, was among the last of the old celebrity haunts on Broadway. During its waning years, Mr. Dempsey was a fixture in the corner booth, where he usually sat with his back to the window, greeting customers. He died in 1983 at 87.</p>
        <p>Slattery of the Subway</p>
        <p>Q.: The words ''Slattery Plaza'' appear on signs at the Woodhaven Boulevard station on the R and G subway lines, but to my knowledge there has never been a Slattery Plaza above ground there. Why?</p>
        <p>A.: Slattery Plaza was a small cluster of stores that occupied a traffic island on Horace Harding Boulevard in the 1930's and 40's, and disappeared when the Long Island Expressway was built, said Jeff Gottlieb, president of the Central Queens Historical Society.</p>
        <p>He said the plaza was named for James Slattery of Jackson Heights, an engineer who helped map the BMT subway lines.</p>
        <p>False Alarms Drop</p>
        <p>Q.: In the mid 1990's the city began removing street-corner fire-alarm boxes, arguing that they were used primarily to send false alarms. Now that many have been removed, are there fewer false alarms?</p>
        <p>A.: The number of malicious false alarms has plummeted, from 111,657 in 1995 to the 62,089 reported last year, according to Jerard Allas, a spokesman for the Fire Department. It is worth noting, however, that the number of false alarms had already significantly fallen after the late 1970's, when firefighters responded to almost 300,000 false alarms a year.</p>
        <p>Not that many street-corner alarm boxes have actually disappeared. There were 16,885 in 1995, before the city disconnected about 4,000 in the South Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens as part of a 45-day pilot program; today there are 15,077. Under a compromise reached with the City Council in 1996, the Giuliani administration agreed to replace and upgrade many of the boxes it had removed, particularly in poor neighborhoods where many households were without phones.</p>
        <p>Until 1978, fire dispatchers responded to all alarms that were sent from street-corner boxes. Most of the old mechanical pull boxes -- which first appeared on New York City street corners in the late 19th century -- have been converted to a voice system that requires that a caller push a button and speak directly to a 911 operator.</p>
