        <p>WHERE'S WALLACE? Written and illustrated by Hilary Knight. Simon &amp; Schuster. $17. (Ages 4 to 8) Wallace is a cute little ape who escapes from the zoo. His keeper, Mr. Frumbee, chases him all over town; the game of this book, first published in 1964, is to find the rascal in the double-page panoramic illustrations. There are all sorts of witty vignettes in each busy scene.Young children are best at the game. The ''Waldo'' books, which came decades later, are based on the same joke. Wallace is as charming as ever.</p>
        <p>IF YOU FIND A ROCK. By Peggy Christian. Photographs by Barbara Hirsch Lember. Harcourt. $16. (Ages 6 to 9) This contemplative book about rocks has elegant, hand-tinted black-and-white photographs opposite pages with blank verse commentary. There are, after all, rocks, stones and pebbles for skipping, writing on, resting on, wishing with, climbing on and just holding.</p>
        <p>WHITE FANG. By Jack London. Illustrated by Ed Young. Atheneum. $25. (Ages 10 and up) This thrilling 1906 adventure novel about the great half-dog, half-wolf, set in the Klondike gold rush, has been reissued stylishly. Fine paper and mysterious full-page illustrations.</p>
        <p>WHY NOT? Written and illustrated by Mary Wormell. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $15. (Ages 2 to 6) Barnaby the kitten learns barnyard behavior the hard way. Why not chase the chickens, annoy the sheep? Barnaby finds out.</p>
        <p>GOOD-BYE FOR TODAY: The Diary of a Young Girl at Sea. By Peter and Connie Roop. Illustrated by Thomas B. Allen. Atheneum. $16. (Ages 7 to 10) Laura keeps a journal in 1871, when her whole family goes on a voyage from Japan to the Arctic on her father's ''hen's frigate,'' a whaler with a family aboard. The story is based on two real families.</p>
        <p>I WALK AT NIGHT. By Lois Duncan. Illustrated by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher. Viking. $15.99. (Ages 5 to 9) The confidences of a cat who is properly independent and diffident. The illustrations are lush, mysterious and magical.</p>
        <p>THE AMAZING LIFE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. By James Cross Giblin. Illustrated by Michael Dooling. Scholastic. $17.95. (Ages 5 to 9) This large-format illustrated biography is unusual in several respects. The text is supported by a chronology, information about Franklin's inventions, sayings from ''Poor Richard's Almanack,'' historic sites young readers might visit and an annotated bibliography; the artist describes the research that went into the handsome, accurate illustrations.</p>
        <p>INTO THE A, B, SEA. By Deborah Lee Rose. Illustrated by Steve Jenkins. Scholastic. $15.95. (Ages 3 to 8) The alphabet is described in marine terms, from anemones, barnacles and crabs to yellowfin and zooplankton. The illustrations are dazzlingly witty cut-paper collages in brilliant colors. There's a kind of glossary with details about creatures and their behaviors.</p>
        <p>STARRING GRACE. By Mary Hoffman. Illustrated by Caroline Binch. Phyllis Fogelman/Penguin Putnam. $13.99. (Ages 8 to 12) The heroine of two popular storybooks, ''Amazing Grace'' and ''Boundless Grace,'' is growing up. This installment of her story is a chapter book. A summer adventure in the backyard ends with performing in a play.</p>
