        <p>In Paris's gently declining temperatures, the low-hung fall sun will still warm you outdoors, if you choose a cafe on the north side of the street, and gas heaters start going on for those who choose the southern, sunless side of the boulevards.</p>

        <p>In Paris's gently declining temperatures, the low-hung fall sun will still warm you outdoors, if you choose a cafe on the north side of the street, and gas heaters start going on for those who choose the southern, sunless side of the boulevards.</p>
        <p>Spectacularly sunny days may last into November for a stroll in one of the pristine parks -- the Jardin du  Luxembourg, Parc Monceau or Tuileries gardens -- but it is generally a time when Paris begins moving indoors, as music and theater come to life, and the museums unveil their  offerings for the winter season. And the Paris opera and ballet, whether at the marvelously opulent and newly restored Palais Garnier, the hard-edged Opera Bastille, or the Theatre  du Chatelet on the Place du Chatelet, offer tempting choices.</p>
        <p>It is a time for fall festivals -- the Salon du Chocolat at the end of October, or the Marjolaine, an immense crafts fair at the Bois de Vincennes, in November, where outdoor stands feature organic specialties and wines, all under the umbrella of a kind of back-to-the-earth environmentalist spirit. On the third Thursday of November, Paris celebrates the annual arrival of Beaujolais Nouveau; cafes, wine bars and restaurants feature the new vintage, and Parisians throng to them for a taste.</p>
        <p>As winter sets in in earnest, about mid-December, the rink in front of the Hotel de Ville opens, where one can skate free of charge in front of  the magnificent town hall, with the towers and spires of Notre-Dame clearly visible just across the Seine.  The cool weather also stimulates appetites, and Paris restaurants lure diners with a rich variety of game dishes and fall mushrooms.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The Opera Garnier, Place de l'Opera, is presenting Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' with staging by Benno Besson, under the direction of the Hungarian conductor Ivan Fischer, through early January. Tickets cost $3.95 to $88, at 7.6 francs to the dollar.  Call (33-8) 36.69.78.68 or, within France, (08) 36.69.78.68.</p>
        <p>Puccini's ''Tosca,'' conducted by Antonello Allemandi, takes center stage at the Opera Bastille (ticket office at 120, rue de Lyon), until Nov. 11. Tickets: $7.90 to $88. Call (33-8) 36.69.78.68.</p>
        <p>At the Theatre du Chatelet, 1, place  du Chatelet, a fresh production of the comic opera by Jacques Offenbach, ''La Belle Helene,'' is being performed through Nov. 9. Light and refreshing, its froth is sustained by Marc Minkowski's conducting, with staging by Laurent Pelly. Tickets cost $9.20 to $88; (33-1) 40.28.28.40.</p>
        <p>For ballet fans, the Opera Bastille is reviving Rudolf Nureyev's 1985 production of Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker Suite,'' with the orchestra of the Paris Opera conducted by Viktor Fedotov. Performances through Dec. 24. Tickets: $6.60 to $88.</p>
        <p>At the Palais Garnier, a production of ''In the Middle Somewhat Elevated,'' by the American choreographer William Forsythe with music by Thom Willems, with three other Forsythe ballets, will run through Nov. 11. Tickets: $3.95 to $34.</p>
        <p>This fall's blockbuster museum show is titled ''Mediterranee: From Courbet to Matisse, 1850-1925,'' at the  Grand Palais, 3, avenue du General Eisenhower. Ninety paintings illustrate the hold that the Mediterranean has exercised on artists from the north of France and northern Europe since the 19th century. Through Jan. 15. Wednesday to Monday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Wednesday till 9:45 p.m. (Those with reservations only before 1 p.m. on most days.)  Admission: $6.60; for reservations, call (33-1) 44.13.17.17, from abroad; (08) 92.68.46.94 from within France.</p>
        <p>Salon du Chocolat is an annual celebration of the art of the chocolatier, for all those who love the stuff. This year from Oct. 28 to Nov. 1, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., at the foot of the Eiffel Tower at Espace Eiffel Branly, 29-55 Quai Branly, (33-1) 45.03.21.26, in the Seventh Arrondissement. Tickets: $6.60.</p>
        <p>At the exuberant Parc Floral in the Bois de Vincennes, on the eastern edge of the city (Chateau de Vincennes Metro stop) is the Marjolaine, an immense outdoor annual crafts fair featuring organic foods and wines, household products, and health and cosmetic treatments. This year's dates are Nov. 10 to 19 from 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., and until 10 p.m. on Nov. 10, 14 and 17. Tickets: $5.95. Call (33-1) 45.56.09.09.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>A stroll through the Latin Quarter, on the Left Bank, should not omit a stop at the Musee National du Moyen Age, 6, place Paul-Painleve, which has just inaugurated a new Garden of the Middle Ages. Set among brick paths and ringed by latticework fencing, the garden was inspired by the luxuriant detail of the museum's famed 15th-century tapestry ''The Lady and the Unicorn.'' The small but richly planted garden, under soaring sycamores and chestnuts, features kitchen herbs, a child's garden, medicinal herbs and even plants that formed the basis of love potions. It also has a Forest of the Unicorn, a children's play area under trees, with games that evoke the tapestry. Open daily except Tuesday from 9:15 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $3.95; call (33-1) 53.73.78.16.</p>
        <p>If you're traveling with children, you might block out time for a visit to the big La Villette park, which includes the Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie , 30, avenue Corentin-Cariou, in the 19th Arrondissement. The main museum building is a kind of Pompidou Center on steroids, and features hands-on exhibits, including a Cite des Enfants for ages 3 to 5 and another for ages 5 to 12, with games, robots and water mills. Outside, you can clamber into a full-size submarine, the Argonaute. A combined ticket of $7.25 includes admission to the Cite des Enfants, the Argonaute and museum exhibitions. Nearby, on the south side of the sprawling park,  is the Cite de la Musique, with a fascinating collection of musical instruments. Go early, since some exhibits, shows or films require advance booking. Admission: $5.25. Call (33-1) 44.84.44.84.</p>
        <p>If you've had your fill of museums, take the No. 13 Metro to the suburb of St.-Denis and the venerable 12th-century Basilica of St.-Denis. The  church, light and delicate despite its size, is generally considered the cradle of the Gothic style. Badly damaged during the French Revolution, it was restored in the 19th century. It is the burial ground of French kings, although the tombs were eventually emptied. The royal tombs are magnificent examples of medieval and Renaissance statuary. At 1, rue de la Legion d'Honneur. Entry is free. A visit to the tombs (closed when Mass is celebrated) costs $4.25; free for those under 18. Call (33-1) 48.09.83.54.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The Ile St.-Louis is about as Parisian as you can get, and one of its delights is the Hotel du Jeu de Paume, at 54, rue St.-Louis en l'Isle,  set on a tiny courtyard reached through a timbered passageway. Its 32 rooms were created in buildings that began as covered tennis courts in the 17th century. Simple contemporary furnishings adorn the rooms. Doubles: $168 to $218; (33-1) 43.26.14.18, fax (33-1) 40.46.02.76.</p>
        <p>On a small side street just off the Luxembourg Gardens, is the Hotel Le Ste.-Beuve, at 9, rue Ste.-Beuve, with 22 rooms done in soft pastel shades in a vaguely English style. Doubles: $100 to $224; (33-1) 45.48.20.07, fax (33-1) 45.48.67.52.</p>
        <p>Budget: The Hotel du Vieux Saule, 6, rue de Picardie, is in the Third Arrondissement on the edge of the Marais, about 10 minutes from the Metro stop Filles du Calvaire. It has 31 simply furnished rooms on a narrow side street just off one of the city's delightful old cast-iron covered markets. Doubles: $78 to $104; (33-1) 42.72.01.14, fax (33-1) 40.27.88.21.</p>
        <p>The Hotel des Grandes Hommes, at 17, place du Pantheon, across from the neo-Classical splendor of the Pantheon and near the Sorbonne, has 32 simply decorated rooms, many with timbered ceilings. Sixth-floor rooms have narrow balconies with  views out to the glimmering white dome of Sacre-Coeur on the heights of Montmartre. Doubles: $112 to $158; (33-1) 46.34.19.60, fax (33-1) 43.26.67.32.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Pavillon de la Reine, at 28, place des Vosges in the Marais, is a hidden jewel whose ivy-clad facade faces a tiny courtyard just off the arcaded square that is one of the architectural masterpieces of 17th-century Paris. It has 55 sumptuous rooms, many with beamed ceilings, equally grand bathrooms, and a delicately vaulted breakfast room. Doubles: $290 to $350; (33-1) 40.29.19.19, fax (33-1) 40.29.19.20.</p>
        <p>In June, the elegant Hotel Meurice, at 228, rue de Rivoli, the center-of-Paris landmark that once attracted the likes of King George VI and Salvador Dali, reopened after two years of renovation. Its 160 splendid rooms are hardly outshone by the late 19th-century charm of the Art Nouveau dome over the tea salon and the rococo interior of the main restaurant, Le Meurice. Doubles: $500 to $595; (33-1) 44.58.10.10, fax (33-1) 44.58.10.15.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Helene Darroze, 4, rue d'Assas, named for its noted chef, is a new favorite in town. Really two restaurants in one, its casual downstairs room offers lighter dishes, while the more formal rooms upstairs, with eggplant-shaded velour on the walls and stark wooden floors, offer more elaborate fare. A meal upstairs might include foie gras of duck, followed by roast rabbit leg with poultry wings stuffed with herbs, then figs braised in honey and Port for dessert. Dinner downstairs, with wine, about $40 a person; upstairs, about $110. Call (33-1) 42.22.00.11.</p>
        <p>In the shadow of the Pompidou Center, Benoit, 20, rue St.-Martin, (33-1) 42.72.25.76, is a classic Paris bistro, with brass fittings and lace curtains. Its menu has a fair offering of autumn game. A meal might begin with a warm terrine of boletus mushrooms in garlic and herbs followed by roast wild duck simmered in wine sauce, then served with braised cabbage, followed by a plum tart. Dinner, with wine, is about $72.</p>
        <p>Nicely done game can also be enjoyed at Au Petit Marguery, 9, boulevard de Port-Royal, where a typical meal might begin with a pheasant terrine, followed by boned hare braised in a wine sauce with foie gras and truffles. For dessert, a souffle au Grand Marnier. Dinner with wine, about $45; (33-1) 43.31.58.59.</p>
        <p>Tucked away on a side street in the unpretentious 11th Arrondissement  is Le Repaire de Cartouche, 99, rue Amelot, with dark wood paneling and jaunty murals of 17th-century life.  Here dinner might consist of pork liver pate with fig jam, followed by roast grouse packed in a cabbage leaf, and a fig tart. Dinner, with wine, $40; (33-1) 47.00.25.86.</p>
        <p>Opened in March, Bon, at 25, rue de la Pompe in the 16th Arrondissement, features three rooms -- a large dining room for parties, a cozier area with low tables and couches, and a romantic boudoirlike room. Meals tend to be lighter -- with organic, low-calorie and vegetarian menus -- than much Parisian fare. A more traditional dinner might consist of a salad of scallops, tuna steak with sauteed mushrooms, and one of a selection of desserts from Laduree, the celebrated pastry shop. About $46, with wine. Call (33-1) 40.72.70.00.</p>
        <p>If you're traveling with young children, try lunch at Hippopotamus, a chain of 20 Parisian restaurants, with packages of crayons and paper table covers for coloring. TV's throughout the restaurant entertain with cartoons, music and short features. Balloons are distributed after meals. A child's menu of salad, hamburger with fries, ice cream and soft drink or juice costs $6.25. A lunch for grownups of salad, lamb chops with fries, mousse and a small carafe of wine comes to about $16.</p>
