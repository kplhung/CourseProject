        <p>The Ralph Nader Reader</p>
        <p>By Ralph Nader.</p>
        <p>441 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Seven Stories Press. Paper, $19.95.</p>
        <p>As Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush slap new slogans on the screen, baffle the electorate with arguments over prescription drugs and try to one-up each other in televised debates, it is worth rereading the best speech announcing a presidential candidacy of this campaign. Or reading it for the first time, since it got minimal attention when delivered and cannot be found even today on the candidate's Web sites.</p>
        <p>Ralph Nader's speech on Feb. 21 declaring his sure-thing quest for the Green Party's nomination was an angry, principled and coherent condemnation of the current state of American politics. Although his anger sometimes swerves into petulance and his principles into dogmatism, his speech presented a stark and provocative contrast to those of the Republican and Democratic candidates, who sounded as if they had the same pollsters. In their June 1999 announcements, Gore and Bush emphasized exactly the same themes: opposing drugs in schools, involving religious organizations in social welfare programs, promoting foreign trade and using prosperity to help the American family.</p>
        <p>This is what the graying Nader said as he reflected on the waning influence of the consumer and environmental movements he has led since the 1960's:</p>
        <p>''Over the past 20 years, big business has increasingly dominated our political economy. This control by the corporate government over our political government is creating a widening 'democracy gap.' Active citizens are left shouting their concerns over a deep chasm between their government and themselves. . . . The unconstrained behavior of big business is subordinating our democracy to the control of a corporate plutocracy that knows few self-imposed limits to the spread of its power. Moving on all fronts to advance narrow profit motives at the expense of civic values, large corporate lobbies and their law firms have produced a commanding, multi-faceted and powerful juggernaut. They flood public elections with cash, and they use their media conglomerates to exclude, divert or propagandize. They brandish their willingness to close factories here and open them abroad if workers do not bend to their demands. By their control in Congress, they keep the federal cops off the corporate crime, fraud and abuse beats.''</p>
        <p>This speech is the most compelling contemporary document in ''The Ralph Nader Reader,'' a collection of articles and speeches that span his career before, during and after the years when he had more influence on his country than Al Gore and George W. Bush have had, combined. But it pales in comparison with the best of Nader's earlier writings. ''The Safe Car You Can't Buy'' (1959), '' 'Brown Lung': The Cotton-Mill Killer'' (1971) and the essential ''Remarks Before the Conference on Property Tax Reform'' (1970) have the details of the problems and the urgency and specifics of suggested solutions that made him the scourge of big business until the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>Car safety was Nader's first crusade, and the 1959 article in The Nation reporting that a Cornell laboratory had designed a safe car and the auto industry had ignored its findings included this striking thought: ''Automobiles are so designed as to be dangerous at any speed.'' That was the forerunner of his book attacking General Motors' Corvair, ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' which made him famous, especially after G.M. admitted sending out gumshoes to seek material to smear him with. The brown lung article, which also appeared in The Nation, represented a shift in focus from workers to consumers. Nader detailed the textile industry's efforts to block any action to curb byssinosis, a condition resembling emphysema that made each breath a struggle for thousands of workers, who were routinely fired if they reported the disease, which could not be claimed under workmen's compensation in any state at the time.</p>
        <p>Almost a decade before the property tax revolt that sparked measures like California's Proposition 13, Nader was offering a simple explanation of why residential taxes were so high. With his staff of ''Nader's Raiders,'' he studied cities large and small and found that industrial giants like United States Steel and Union Carbide had the political muscle to win low assessments. Nader ended his report with the sort of call to action that runs throughout the book: ''The combined force of courageous citizens in every locality, together with efforts by national organizations and authorities, will rapidly lead to a much more equitable property tax system with all that means for city and county services, education, small property holders, land use, the elderly and a more honest political structure.''</p>
        <p>Nader's other strain of optimism concerned the law as a weapon for social justice. In 1972, the Harvard Law School's most distinguished graduate in the second half of the 20th century urged that year's students to consider becoming ''offensive attorneys for justice.'' He was still at it in 1991 at Hofstra's law school when he said ''the principal function of the law ideally should be to curb the abuses of raw power and to clear the way for the fulfillment of the human potential.''</p>
        <p>But while the earlier essays were more hopeful than angry, anger dominates the pieces from the 1990's, which make up more than half of those in the book. In a 1996 article titled ''It's Time to End Corporate Welfare as We Know It,'' he raged against the exploitation of public lands, the savings and loan bailouts and giveaways of drug patents. ''Yet what,'' he asked, ''is the big issue in this country and in Washington when the word 'welfare' is spoken? It is the $300 monthly check given a welfare mother, most of which is spent immediately in the consumer economy.''</p>
        <p>Nader's despair about the Democrats, who provided the allies he praises in his earliest essays, emerged in the 80's. In the course of a wide-ranging denunciation of Ronald Reagan at the National Press Club in 1984, he was even harder on the Democrats. He recalled Thomas Jefferson saying government should curb ''the excesses of the moneyed interests'' and Franklin D. Roosevelt condemning ''the malefactors of great wealth.'' Reagan, he said, had been ''blessed by an opposition party that has largely surrendered the basic contention of its politics -- namely that of challenging the maldistribution of power between the haves and the have-nots.'' In 1996, in an article condemning President Clinton as a lackey of Wall Street, Nader complained that ''the defiantly deteriorating national Democratic Party, stripped of any grass-roots engagement, obligated to corporate moneys and personnel, and chaired by the senator from Aetna (Dodd), refuses to recognize the need for a comprehensive pro-labor agenda, leaving a supportive A.F.L.-C.I.O. as supplicant with nowhere to go.''</p>
        <p>So perhaps his Green Party candidacy has the internal logic of providing a refuge for liberal Democrats who feel betrayed by the party's drift to the center. Of course, had he run instead in the Democratic Party primaries, he would have got some intense exposure, participation in winter debates and perhaps influence on Gore's proposals. He would not have become president, but he won't this way either. In fact, this useful book undercuts Nader's campaign argument that the major party candidates are ''tweedledum and tweedledee'' with ''few major differences.''</p>
        <p>Whatever Gore may have done to keep business happy with him -- and despite his recent attacks on the drug and oil industries, he has done quite well at the Wall Street trough -- he has hardly been a corporate welfare recipient of the sort Nader condemned in these words: ''Local governments are anteing up three, four, five hundred million dollars to lure very profitable baseball, football and basketball sports moguls who don't want to share the profits. Corporate sports are being subsidized by cities.''</p>
        <p>That is, on the other hand, a fair description of how the Texas Rangers got a new ballpark out of the city of Arlington when George W. Bush owned the team. Unless its $135 million price tag puts it below Nader's threshold. Then there is one of Bush's proudest boasts about his first year as governor, the 1995 passage of tort reform legislation, an idea Gore does not support. That same year, Nader was writing about comparable legislation pending in Congress, warning that ''if the wrongdoers' lobby prevails, the local control that judges and juries have had over wrongdoers will be severely limited.''</p>
        <p>In an odd way, ''The Ralph Nader Reader'' shows that Nader is part of an old political stream, if not a mainstream. When he dismisses his opponents as ''a political duopoly, the DemRep Party,'' he employs the traditional exaggeration of third party candidates. But George C. Wallace said it better when he insisted there was ''not a dime's worth of difference'' between Republicans and Democrats.</p>
