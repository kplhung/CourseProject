        <p>THE phone call came into the Nassau hot line run by the AMT Children of Hope Foundation on the morning of Oct. 6. Timothy Jaccard, the foundation's founder and president, answered.  But on the other end of the line, there was silence. ''Are you looking for help? Are you are in trouble and pregnant?'' Mr. Jaccard asked. The caller, a woman, exhaled a sob. He reassured her that she had options and pleaded with her to go to a hospital, where she would remain anonymous and could relinquish her child if she wished. Then, there was a dial tone.</p>
        <p>Just a few hours later, the woman, who was now in labor, arrived in the emergency room at Winthrop-University Hospital and was quickly moved to the labor and delivery suite where she gave birth to a boy seven hours later.</p>
        <p>She was there, she told the nurses, because of her conversation with Mr. Jaccard. And through that phone call, she unwittingly became a test case for a new state law that protects parents from prosecution if they drop off unwanted newborns in a safe place.</p>
        <p>The woman was released Sunday morning and the newborn left the hospital Wednesday evening in the custody of the county's Child Protective Services and the Department of Social Services. Citing patient confidentiality issues, officials declined to release further information about the woman and child.</p>
        <p>''The message that should go out to consumers of Long Island is that there are places that will accept their infant so that we can avoid the issues of babies in Dumpsters and everything that goes along with that,'' said Eileen Magri, director of nursing for maternal-child health at Winthrop-University Hospital. ''Any woman who is unsure of what to do if she finds herself pregnant, there are places she can turn to.''</p>
        <p>If this woman had given birth in a hospital and abandoned the newborn  before New York's safe haven law was enacted in July, she could have been guilty of a felony and and could have faced up to four years in jail.  Officials consider a baby abandoned even if it is born in hospital and the mother leaves without making arrangements for its care.</p>
        <p>In enacting the new law, New York has joined 15 other states that have passed similar legislation in an effort to reduce the number of dead or abandoned infants. Under the New York measure, mothers can anonymously hand off their infants up to five days old, to a responsible adult, religious, community or medical organization. The parent can reclaim the child within 15 months once social case workers have determined that the mother or father is capable of caring for the child. The child can be adopted only after the mother relinquishes her parental rights.</p>
        <p>Legislator Michael D'Andre of St. James sponsored a similar bill that was unanimously approved by Suffolk's lawmakers in May.</p>
        <p>Since 1996 it is estimated that one infant has been abandoned every 12 to 18 months in Suffolk, said Dennis Nowaki, spokesperson for the county's Department of Social Services.  In Nassau, Dr. Peter Clement, assistant to the commissioner of the department of social services, said from 1996 through 1999, nine children were found abandoned in the county.  Nationwide, some 105 babies of nearly four million born in 1998 were found abandoned in public places; 33 infants were found dead, according to the federal Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>Huntington Hospital was the first place on the Island to establish a safe haven for unwanted babies.</p>
        <p>The program's coordinator, Dr. Michael B. Grosso, who is also vice president for medical affairs, said any babies that were brought in would be screened for a number of diseases including AIDS, hepatitis, thyroid problems and metabolism disorders, as required by the state, and would be evaluated for malnutrition, physical abuse and neglect. If the mother brings in the child herself, she would be invited but not compelled to provide information about the baby's medical history.</p>
        <p>''We are seeking to address the current barrier that makes desperate young people afraid: to transfer the care of their infant,'' Dr. Grosso said.</p>
        <p>In Nassau, the County Medical Center has been functioning unofficially as a safe haven for nearly eight months.</p>
        <p>Dr. Joan McInerney, chairman of the department of emergency medicine, said, ''It's ideal because we are centrally located and it has been our historical mission to evaluate and treat all patients who come to the emergency department.''</p>
        <p>Although the logistics of the program are still being ironed out, she said the emergency department would most likely be designated as the drop-off site for newborns when the program officially began, probably in mid-November.</p>
        <p>Officials at Winthrop-University Hospital said they also had begun formal talks about setting up a safe haven. A committee composed of personnel from emergency services, nursing, pediatrics and social services, among others, Ms. Magri said, was formed several months ago. The program is similar to other safe havens in that the infant could be dropped off at the emergency room and no questions would be asked of the parent. Then the infant would be medically screened and tested and examined for signs of abus before being placed in foster care.</p>
        <p>Officials at Winthrop-University Hospital and Huntington Hospital said it was unclear whether they would receive financial support from outside sources while Nassau County Medical Center was discussing applying for state assistance.</p>
        <p>Advocates of this legislation on the Island want other hospitals to follow the example of centers at the forefront of the safe haven movement.</p>
        <p>''I would hope all full-service hospitals would have safe havens,'' said Legislation D'Andre. ''The closer the hospital is geographically, the more convenient it is for the mother, because the newborn would have to go to the hospital anyway. The cooperation at Winthrop-University Hospital was so good that it makes it that much easier for the mother. Maybe other hospitals will take their cue from this.''</p>
        <p>In Nassau, information about safe havens is available by calling (877) 796-4673. In Suffolk, the number is (866) 852-2229.</p>
