        <p>To the Editor: Martha Weinman Lear and I grew up in Boston at about the same time. Her Boston in the 1950's was a ''consummately dull town.'' My Boston was enjoyable, stimulating; hers, it seems, insulated and insular.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lear writes: ''When you and a date got out of the movies and it was too late to get a hamburger and too early to go home, the only thing  left to do was to park on Memorial Drive, by the sweetly flowing Charles, for a deliciously agonizing hour of Please and No.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Martha Weinman Lear and I grew up in Boston at about the same time. Her Boston in the 1950's was a ''consummately dull town.'' My Boston was enjoyable, stimulating; hers, it seems, insulated and insular.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lear writes: ''When you and a date got out of the movies and it was too late to get a hamburger and too early to go home, the only thing  left to do was to park on Memorial Drive, by the sweetly flowing Charles, for a deliciously agonizing hour of Please and No.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Lear was close to the Smith House and Howard Johnson, both serving good hamburgers, both overlooking the Charles.</p>
        <p>Enjoying Billie Holiday, Stan Getz, Serge Challof, Pearl Bailey and good food at the Hi Hat, Columbus near Massachusetts Avenue, was hardly being deprived.</p>
        <p>Sin in Scollay Square? I'm shocked. Shocked. The all-night movie next to Joe &amp; Nemo's? Ladies of the evening? They had them at the Beacon and after-hours places (post 1 a.m. in Boston) serving whiskey in coffee cups.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lear got it half right. It was Sally Keith, not Sally Rand, who twirled her tassels in opposite directions; Keith didn't do ''burlesque''; she twirled tassels. Sally Rand did feathered fans.</p>
        <p>My Boston had no need to ''loosen up,'' ''become urbane.'' It was.</p>
