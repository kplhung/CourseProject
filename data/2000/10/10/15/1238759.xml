        <p>IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS</p>
        <p>The Everyday Interactions</p>
        <p>That Get Under the Skin of Blacks and Whites.</p>
        <p>By Lena Williams.</p>
        <p>268 pp. New York: Harcourt. $22.</p>
        <p>HERE at Etiquette Central, we are under siege from indignant citizens demanding justice. Applications to be excused from observing the rules arrive bolstered by documentation of illness, moodiness, busyness, family background, cultural background, provocation and plain old temptation, or by undocumented claims of free-spiritedness. Reports of misconduct pour in, along with petitions to amend old rules or institute new ones. True, we welcome citizen participation. A republic must consent to any rules that govern it, question those that are outdated or wrong and address new needs. There is just an awful lot, considering that only yesterday the population was ridiculing etiquette and declaring itself satisfied with unrestrained natural behavior, thank you very much. No sooner did people grudgingly admit the legitimacy of etiquette than everyone began bashing everyone else in its name.</p>
        <p>In ''It's the Little Things,'' we have a whole bookload of citations, exemption claims and rule revisions from a black point of view, gathered from Lena Williams's own experience and focus groups. A black doctor is advised by his white real estate agent to remove his African art if he expects to sell his house to whites. Black youngsters who are loudly vulgar in movie theaters are explained as carrying on a tradition that began to protest the racism of ''Birth of a Nation.'' Why does ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' attract few black contestants? ''We've spent so much of our lives trying to learn the white man's English, the white man's history, the white man's ways. Who has had time to deal with trivia?''</p>
        <p>But as anyone discovers who tries playing ''Let me tell you what you do that drives me crazy,'' gripe sessions must also be governed by rules or they make things worse. Sounding off irritably, with no attempt to isolate the offending factor from legitimate behavior, fails to create change and may itself constitute a nuisance.</p>
        <p>Williams, a reporter at The New York Times, plays by many of the rules. She states her grievances in a reasonably civil manner with interesting examples. She acknowledges countergrievances, and devotes one chapter to white complaints about blacks and another to the complaints of other minorities. She admits her own mistakes and ones common among blacks, while refuting the specious argument that this makes everything come out even. Nobody could disagree with her conclusion that ''what the races need more than anything else is to lighten up,'' to cut one another some slack, think before they act on questionable presumptions about other people and memorize a few hitherto unsuspected offenses to be avoided.</p>
        <p>Yet by the time she gets there, her readers may feel that there is no use trying. Missing between the anecdotes and the truisms is a serious examination of the social forces at play in any given incident, with workable suggestions for preventing further friction. The introduction promises to show whites what they shouldn't say and what they should keep in mind as being sensitive, but the text makes it clear that no matter how much care they take, they will be judged with a presumption of racism. Behavior based on conditions from the discriminatory past is obviously abhorrent, but behavior ignoring that past is deemed equally culpable.</p>
        <p>With a journalist's instinct for the startling lead, Williams opens the book with a white woman's tossing her head in an elevator and running her fingers through her hair. Behind her, the author and her brother-in-law, whom she describes as ''a soft-spoken, reserved black man of 62,'' seethe. Is this a legitimate complaint? Grooming in public is rude, but hair tossing is a minor infraction in a society where people brush their teeth in buses.</p>
        <p>Still, if a trivial habit is revealed to be annoying, it doesn't have to be proven malevolent or intentional. What is discouraging is the rationale: that an African-American history of envying white hair makes this gesture as rude as wearing jewels to a soup kitchen. So if the woman in the elevator knows only blacks who seem happy with their hair and their heritage, should politeness require her to harbor suspicions of hair envy?</p>
        <p>Allowing the conditions of the past to influence behavior in the present is exactly what creates the worst category of etiquette crime toward blacks -- the social version of racial profiling. Throughout the book, there are ugly examples of whites' ignoring the presence of blacks, mistaking them for menials and expressing disbelief in their educational and professional credentials. In demanding constant recognition of historical injustice in ''the little things,'' Williams surely does not want to hear such acts defended on the grounds that this is only because blacks were not formerly found at those schools or in those good jobs.</p>
        <p>Are blacks entitled to etiquette exemptions? Etiquette does grant limited free passes on the basis of understandable ignorance (notably in babies and foreigners) or inability (in cases of extreme illness), but Williams wants an additional category of permissible rudeness. She condones a black man who shoved whites on the street -- he nearly knocked one of the women into the gutter'' -- because he was ''striking a blow for his ancestors.'' But as she justly points out, black Americans (the term she prefers) have a long tradition of maintaining high standards of manners under horrid conditions. Even now, when rudeness is rampant in all parts of society, many of the niceties of child-rearing, proper dress and genuine hospitality are being kept alive in black households and community organizations. Williams supports this as ''what we liked to call basic home training.''</p>
        <p>Much of the objectionable behavior she finds in whites -- injecting shop talk into social life, calling everyone by first names -- is attributable to their abandoning those dictates. Job discrimination taught blacks to find dignity in the self, not from an employer, while white society began judging people by what they ''do.'' And it was when blacks demanded the courtesy titles that had been denied them that white society declared it ''friendlier'' -- as ludicrously claimed by strangers -- to drop them. Even the inexcusable rudeness of making instant assumptions about people based on race is exacerbated by society's abolishing the symbolic clues once provided by individual choice -- the degree of formality of clothes (not their cost; that is a different system, called snobbery) and above all, the quality of their manners.</p>
        <p>Abandoning home training and the heritage of good manners is not the solution to white rudeness. Etiquette exemptions are never granted for the purpose of expressing historical grudges, but if they were, people who have had such advantages would not be eligible.</p>
