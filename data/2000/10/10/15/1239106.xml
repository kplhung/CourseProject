        <p>Despite the fact that this band was born out of the Seattle rock scene of the 1990's and two of its members went on to become Foo Fighters, Sunny Day Real Estate is not a grunge outfit. After several breakups and makeups, the band is a bit of everything -- from arena-rock to progressive Yes-like flourishes. They touch many bases, giving up much of the dark, punk emotions of its past, especially on their most recent recording, ''Rising Tide.''</p>

        <p>Despite the fact that this band was born out of the Seattle rock scene of the 1990's and two of its members went on to become Foo Fighters, Sunny Day Real Estate is not a grunge outfit.

        <p>This trio's melodies are strong, their songs and arrangements often complex, and the vocalist Jeremy Enigk has an acrobatic falsetto that either connects or doesn't. That they're appearing in a concert setting rather than a dingy club is an indication that their new sound is bringing more changes for Sunny Day Real Estate, and it now comes down to location, location, location. They'll appear tomorrow at Birch Hill Entertainment Complex in Old Bridge.</p>
