        <p>A FEW blocks off this city's booming waterfront stands a 10-story brown stucco reminder of the real estate bust of the late 1980's, a former industrial building where a residential conversion was left unfinished after its developers went bankrupt and their lender became one of the era's failed savings and loans.</p>
        <p>''It's an eyesore,'' said Rose M. Wingart, 75, of Hoboken, who lives just across the border from the building, referred to in court documents as 689 Henderson Street.</p>
        <p>Around the corner, on a three-acre parcel between Jersey Avenue and Grove Street, along the old Erie Lackawanna Railroad embankment, city officials have approved a 1.2-million-square-foot tower that could eclipse the Henderson Street fiasco in more ways than one. The project, Millennium Towers, would include a pair of 37-story apartment buildings with 534 units, on a six-story base of 1,260 parking spaces and 172,000 square feet for stores and restaurants.</p>
        <p>The two projects would seem to have little in common beside proximity. But a man named Joseph M. Lucarelli has played a key role in both. Mr. Lucarelli, who was imprisoned on a conspiracy charge related to 689  Henderson Street, is construction supervisor for Millennium Towers, and community activists are concerned.</p>
        <p>Millennium Towers would rise 459 feet above the Jersey Avenue Redevelopment Area, an isolated corner of the city north of the Holland Tunnel, now dominated by warehouses and machine shops and officially designated as needing development.</p>
        <p>Millennium Towers was so welcome -- among city officials, anyway -- that Mayor Bret Schundler and the City Council granted the project a 20-year tax abatement and a waiver of the area's normal 110-foot-height limit, which is intended to preserve the view from atop the Palisades, in exchange for a reduction in density. The waiver is contingent on New Jersey Transit's agreeing to build a light rail station next door, which the city hopes would spur further development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucarelli, its construction supervisor, works for United Diversified L.L.C., a development company founded in 1997 and based in Bayonne, said Michael Galella, a partner in the company. Mr. Galella said he and Mr. Lucarelli had the same positions with Millenium Towers L.L.C., a separate company created specifically to develop the project.</p>
        <p>What concerns some is Mr. Lucarelli's 1995 indictment on federal fraud charges involving the Henderson Street project, and his subsequent guilty plea to a single count of conspiracy, for which he was sentenced to 14 months in prison.</p>
        <p>The indictment charged that, beginning in October 1987, Mr. Lucarelli assumed a $7.25 million loan that had been made by North Jersey Savings and Loan of Clifton to a contractor who failed to complete the Henderson Street project. Prosecutors charged that Mr. Lucarelli, using falsified documents relating to the financial condition of his company, L.B.J. Realty, then borrowed another $8.5 million from North Jersey Savings and Loan, ostensibly to complete the project, then obtained cash advances from the bank totaling $1.9 million that he diverted to other properties and his personal use.  Mr. Lucarelli and his company then abandoned the Henderson Street project in August 1989, the indictment states.</p>
        <p>R. Scott Thompson, a former assistant United States attorney for New Jersey who prosecuted the case, said he was surprised to hear that Mr. Lucarelli was still in the construction business. One person familiar with Mr. Lucarelli's role in the Henderson Street project, who asked not to be identified, said, ''If he's the guy who's in charge of day-to-day operations, that thing will never get built.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucarelli, who lives in Kearny, did not return messages left for him at United Diversified. His boss, Mr. Galella, said he knew of Mr. Lucarelli's record. ''It was not a concern because he served his time for that. I believe in giving everyone a second chance,'' said Mr. Galella, who founded United Diversified in 1997 with his partner Joseph Zingale, after they had spent three decades in the beauty supply business.</p>
        <p>''I'm relatively new in the construction industry, and that's one of the reasons we hired Mr. Lucarelli,'' Mr. Galella said, but he added, ''He's on the verge of getting fired, because there's just so much bad publicity about this.''</p>
        <p>To foes of Millenium Towners, Mr. Lucarelli's involvement is a legitimate concern.</p>
        <p>''How do we know the same thing that happened to the Henderson Street project won't happen to Millenium Towers?'' asked Ron Hine, president of the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, a Hoboken-based group that has joined a group in Jersey City in a lawsuit to block the project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galella said financing was not yet in place for the project, which he estimated will cost $140 million to build. Apartments will rent for market rates, but because the project is in a redevelopment area, Mr. Galella said the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development is one possible funding source. His largest project to date is a 15-unit residential building under construction on Jackson Street in Hoboken.</p>
        <p>It is not merely Mr. Lucarelli's involvement that has attracted attention to Millennium Towers. Robert Duval, president of the Sergeant Anthony Neighborhood Association, said the soaring towers would interfere with the sweeping views from the Jersey City Heights section. Potential traffic congestion is another concern, and has prompted two lawsuits seeking to block the project.</p>
        <p>A number of community groups have also joined to submit a petition seeking a referendum to rescind the tax abatement granted to Millennium Towers.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bret Schundler, who is planning to run for governor next year, and the city council president, Tom DeGise, who is hoping to succeed Mr. Schundler as mayor, both defended Millennium Towers as a key to the reviving an underdeveloped section of the city. Mr. DeGise noted, for example, that the council's approval of the height waiver was contingent on an agreement with New Jersey Transit to build a light rail station, which would attract other projects.</p>
        <p>City officials also defended the abatement. They noted it would generate $2.4 million a year in payments in lieu of taxes, against the current $43,000 a year in property taxes now paid on the site, which is vacant but for a deteriorating garage.</p>
        <p>Concerning Mr. Lucarelli's background, Mr. Schundler said he was neither familiar with nor overly concerned about it. Even critics of the project conceded there was nothing illegal about Mr. Lucarelli's involvement. ''If a developer wants to build in Jersey City, I focus on what they want to build -- is what they want to build a positive for Jersey City?'' Mr. Schundler said.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Elkind, president of the Hamilton Park Neighborhood Association, whose members live in an area several blocks south of the project, said the group used the Millenium Towers planning process to negotiate favorable changes with city officials in the Jersey Avenue redevelopment plan, including a reduction in the area where high-rise buildings are allowed, and creation of a mechanism allowing developers to contribute to an open space fund in exchange for increased density. ''There has been some good that has come out of this,'' Mr. Elkind said. ''It remains to be seen if this project will ever be built.''</p>
