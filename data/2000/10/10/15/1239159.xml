        <p>Israelis and Palestinians To Meet With Clinton  Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to meet with President Clinton in Egypt tomorrow to seek a truce. The secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, announced the meeting and advised the Israelis and Palestinians to start cooling the continuing tensions in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>

        <p>No Room for Error As Election Day Nears  The presidential race is so tight that it has set off a lively debate over whether Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush should try to pull ahead or play it safe and hope for the best on Election Day. Top strategists and politicians on both sides are jittery and readily acknowledge that they could lose.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Voters in many Southern states are steeped in doubt and ambivalence about Vice President Al Gore.</p>
