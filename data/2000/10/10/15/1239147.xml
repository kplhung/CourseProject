        <p>After watching its portfolio sink for four months, the SJR investment club got another dose of bad news when it met Wednesday night in Frank Piraino's Staten Island home.

        <p>After watching its portfolio sink for four months, the SJR investment club got another dose of bad news when it met Wednesday night in Frank Piraino's Staten Island home. Lucent Technologies, the club's biggest investment, had announced a profit shortfall that morning, and its stock had plunged 32 percent.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how low it can go,'' grumbled Joseph Fisher, president of the six-member club. ''I say sell,'' Richard Ling said with a smile, to which Tom Navarria retorted: ''Sell? We almost came to blows last month because you wanted to buy.''</p>
        <p>But despite the losses, the club members quickly decided not to sell Lucent -- or any other stock in their $67,000 portfolio. Instead, with $4,000 in cash, they looked for companies to buy. Within minutes, they settled on Pfizer and Intel, despite Mr. Fisher's advice to avoid ''highflying tech stocks.'' Intel is ''a unique company,'' Mr. Navarria said.</p>
        <p>Intel may be unique, but Mr. Navarria's faith in the future of technology companies and the health of American stock markets is not. The get-rich-quick hysteria of recent years may be gone, and in the last six weeks stocks have looked fragile amid fears that economic growth is slowing and corporate profits will fall short of expectations.</p>
        <p>But a raft of evidence, both anecdotal and statistical, suggests that exactly six months after the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index suffered its worst week ever, Americans remain optimistic that stocks are the best place for their money.</p>
        <p>The confidence is striking, considering that prices have not regained the ground they lost since the Nasdaq plunged in mid-April, a 25 percent drop that wiped out more than $1 trillion in paper wealth. The euphoria of 1999 and early 2000, when investors paid seemingly any price for money-losing Internet stocks, is long gone, replaced by pessimism about rising oil prices and slowing growth in corporate earnings.</p>
        <p>Despite a strong rally Friday, the Nasdaq closed at a level below its April low. So far this year, it is off 18.5 percent. Some smaller Internet and technology companies have fared far worse, falling more than 90 percent from the highs they set earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The broader American market is also hurting, although not as badly. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which measures the performance of large companies, closed Friday down 6.5 percent for the year and 11.5 percent from its March highs.</p>
        <p>Yet individual investors continue to pour money into mutual funds at a pace even higher than last year's, especially those buying aggressive growth companies, according to AMG Data, which tracks mutual fund inflows. Charles Schwab, the giant brokerage house based in San Francisco, reports that its clients continue to add tens of billions of dollars in new cash to their accounts every month, a pace substantially higher than last year's. And the number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, after falling over the summer in its typical seasonal lull, rose strongly in September and this month.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the frenzy of last year, when many small investors scrambled for initial public offerings and 18 relatively large stocks rose tenfold or more, has abated. Trading volume has fallen from its peak in March, and the amount of new money invested in mutual funds has dropped substantially from the first quarter. The amount of money raised from the public in initial offerings has leveled off, and the average amount a new stock rises after its offering is lower this year than in 1999.</p>
        <p>In the winter and early spring, ''the market reached ungodly levels of speculation,'' said Gregory Smith, an analyst at Chase H &amp; Q who covers online brokerage firms. He noted that trading in over-the-counter bulletin board stocks, which are often highly risky companies that trade for pennies a share, rose fivefold between October 1999 and March 2000. Since then, volume has fallen to last year's levels.</p>
        <p>''What I do see is the risk appetite changing,'' Mr. Smith said. ''People aren't buying speculative stocks, they're not trading as much.''</p>
        <p>But if the Nasdaq's plunge has eased last winter's fever, it has hardly eroded the underlying confidence in stocks that two decades of rising share prices and a decade of strong economic growth have instilled in Americans.</p>
        <p>Investors also remember that big drops in 1998, after the Asian financial crisis, and 1987 proved to be little more than great buying opportunities, said Charles Geisst, finance professor at Manhattan College and author of ''Wall Street: A History.''</p>
        <p>''Everybody, including myself, views this as a short-term blip,'' Mr. Geisst said.</p>
        <p>After all, despite its losses so far in 2000, the Nasdaq is up 18 percent from a year ago. Over the longer term, the index's gains are even more striking. It has more than doubled in the last two years and has risen tenfold in the last decade. The S.&amp; P. 500 has risen 37 percent in the last two years and almost fivefold in the last decade.</p>
        <p>As a result, although this year's losses have been painful for many investors, most have years of appreciation to cushion the blow. Terry Sneed, a theatrical director in Knoxville, Tenn., has watched his investments drop by half this year. But he said the fall does not trouble him, because in the four previous years his portfolio rocketed, thanks largely to his purchase of the Internet company Yahoo in 1996.</p>
        <p>''My whole portfolio has a 2,000-something percent return over the past five years now,'' Mr. Sneed said. ''This was a down year rather than an up year, but I think if you're a long-term investor, you've got to take the downs with the ups.''</p>
        <p>Despite the Nasdaq's fall, Mr. Sneed remains convinced that technology companies will grow faster than others over time. ''I'm a big believer in tech,'' he said. ''I don't have any of those old-economy stocks, Procter &amp; Gamble, or any of those. I still hope to keep pumping money into the market.''</p>
        <p>Many investors who sat out the Nasdaq's 1999 boom have, meanwhile, also missed out on its bust and suffered relatively small losses this year. ''Of course I've lost money,'' said Dorothy Brown, an Episcopal priest in Morgantown, W.Va. ''Everybody's lost money.'' After gaining 8 percent in 1999 and 12 percent in 1998, she is down about 5 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Brown, 53, said she believed stocks were the best way to save for retirement and she plans to keep buying them. ''I'm definitely going to stay invested,'' she said. In fact, Ms. Brown recently bought a fund that invests in small companies, increasing her exposure to one of the riskiest areas of the market.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown is not alone. AMG reported that investors bought almost $200 billion in funds through the first nine months of this year, compared with $110 billion last year. Nearly all the new money went to higher-risk funds investing in technology stocks and in growth and aggressive growth stocks, which have strong potential for big profit gains. But since the first quarter, investors have put less money in technology-only funds, which are among the riskiest of all, preferring funds that invest more broadly and are therefore perceived as safer.</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone who has suffered this year has the cushion of big gains, and some individual investors say their losses have soured them on stocks. ''I've lost money, and I'm not too happy with it,'' said Bevalene Waldrip of Blairsville, Ga., a retired customer service representative for BellSouth. ''I'm just kind of burned out and trying to hang on.'' Ms. Waldrip estimated her portfolio had fallen 60 percent this year. She does not plan to invest new money in stocks.</p>
        <p>But back at the SJR club, Ms. Waldrip's views do not carry much weight. ''We should take advantage of the drops in some of the quality names,'' said Frank P. Miello. ''I see it as a buying opportunity.''</p>
