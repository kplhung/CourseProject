        <p>Larry David and his wife didn't want to go to the pornography star's dinner party. They called the man by accident (a telephone number mix-up) and accepted only out of courtesy.</p>
        <p>On the evening of the event they get lost on the way, create ill will when Larry refuses to remove his shoes at the door and sit horrified at the table as their host tells graphic anecdotes about his sexual workday as casually as if he were recounting a computer system disaster. Then Larry breaks a lamp, which sends his hostess into verbal hysteria. So he says his awkward but polite farewells, reaches his car, assesses his wife's level of annoyance over the whole thing and, just as he's breathing a sigh of relief, realizes that he left his wristwatch inside.</p>
        <p>And he begins to whine. ''I don't want to do a double goodbye,'' Larry tells his wife. But he has to. Because life is filled with angst and insecurity on Mr. David's new HBO comedy series, ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' And sometimes it gives names to phenomena that less creative people might observe a thousand times without acknowledging out loud.</p>
        <p>What is the double goodbye if not a continuation in the grand tradition of ''double dipping'' (i.e., chips in salsa), ''shrinkage'' and mastery ''of your own domain''? Mr. David of course brought those terms to public attention as co-creator and executive producer of ''Seinfeld'' from 1990 to 1996. And what is ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' which has its premiere tonight at 9:30, if not the real ''Seinfeld'' spinoff? (In NBC's recast, reworked, rethought ''Michael Richards Show,'' the man who once was Kramer plays a private eye, of all things.)</p>
        <p>In ''Seinfeld'' Jerry Seinfeld played a comedian named Jerry Seinfeld who lived in New York and had a colorful trio of friends. Mr. David was widely reported to be the inspiration for George Costanza (Jason Alexander), the hapless bald guy to whom everything bad seemed to happen. But his input was not limited to the travails of one character. In real life it was Mr. David, not Mr. Seinfeld, who had an eccentric neighbor named Kramer; they lived across the hall from each other at Manhattan Plaza, on 43rd Street at 10th Avenue. So if those eight years on NBC were about life as Mr. David saw it, how will his new series differ?</p>
        <p>Well, the central character is married, rich and has premium cable's freedom of speech. (Some viewers may even miss the creative sexual euphemisms inspired by broadcast network policy.)</p>
        <p>In ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' Larry David plays a television writer-producer named Larry David who lives in Hollywood and has a colorful pack of celebrity friends. Larry is the co-creator of a former megahit series called ''Seinfeld,'' as his wife points out when they are having trouble getting a table at a hot new restaurant. But that fact seems to do the fictional Larry little good. Unshaven and dressed in his workout clothes, he can't even get the saleswomen at a fashionable jewelry store to buzz him through the locked front door. And that's one of the least of the humiliations that befall him in the first few episodes.</p>
        <p>''If you like a show where everything goes wrong, you'll like this show,'' said Mr. David, 53, in a telephone interview from his office in Los Angeles. But his own existence isn't filled with this much frustration, he contended. ''That's my COMEDIC view of life. It would be pretty tough to live like that.''</p>
        <p>True. The fictional Larry has a movie theater contretemps with an obnoxious woman who turns out to be his pal Richard Lewis's new girlfriend; upsets his wife' friend Nancy by appearing to become sexually aroused by her; makes enemies of a Barneys salesman who did him a favor, a restaurant captain he didn't tip and his manager's parents (twice); becomes convinced that Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen have stopped speaking to him (why else wouldn't they call to reconfirm their date for the Paul Simon concert?); infuriates his wife by watching the last two minutes of a football game on television rather than welcoming her home properly after a trip; and is tricked into moving furniture for a blind man.</p>
        <p>And that's only a sampling. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is scheduled to appear in one of the first season's 10 episodes, and she's sure to be annoyed with him, too.</p>
        <p>''Larry has always been this kind of guy, where the world moves one way and he moves another,'' said Carolyn Strauss, HBO's senior vice president for original programming, who oversees the new series. ''It's the clash of that, that's always been a hallmark of his stand-up, and what influenced 'Seinfeld' so much.''</p>
        <p>''You really get to see his struggles,'' she continued. ''And now that he's this incredibly successful guy, there's almost this whole new level to his comedy.'' Although the subject doesn't come up immediately in the show, the fictional Larry is presumably worth the $200 million-plus that the real Mr. David is said to have earned from his ''Seinfeld'' years.</p>
        <p>Maybe all that money makes Mr. David confident enough to take a risk on an improvised show (he writes the outlines) starring a middle-aged bald man whose salient personality trait is uncertainty. He has written, of bald men, that ''we have to dress a little better, make a little more money and have a little more charm just to compete -- and we do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. David, a born-and-bred New Yorker, hasn't always kept his face out of the spotlight. He began as a stand-up comic and worked as a writer-performer for ''Fridays'' and a writer for ''Saturday Night Live.'' In the 1980's he had small parts in Woody Allen's films ''Radio Days'' and ''New York Stories'' and Henry Jaglom's ''Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?''</p>
        <p>And in the first year of ''Seinfeld'' he appeared uncredited as characters with names like Gum Guy, Man With Cape and Man on Raft. Later -- apparently having become camera-shy -- he played the voice of George Steinbrenner, when George Costanza worked for the Yankees. And his HBO special a year ago, which inspired the new series, seemed to prove that people enjoyed seeing a really rich man stumbling through life the way everybody else does.</p>
        <p>''In one way he's this mature adult and then in another way he's this vulnerable -- almost like a teenager that doesn't fit in,'' said Cheryl Hines, who plays Mr. David's wife, Cheryl, on the series as she did in the special. ''He really notices all the small moments in life that are funny.''</p>
        <p>''Everything about him is very subtle,'' she said. ''That's why this show -- I think some people are not going to get it.'' But she quickly added, maybe remembering just how many ''Seinfeld'' fans there are, ''A lot of people will.''</p>
