        <p>Pudlin, a 15-year-old junior at the Baldwin School, overcame a tiring Donohue in the final 30 yards to clock 14 minutes 41 seconds on the hilly 2.5-mile course.

        <p>Julia Pudlin of Bryn Mawr, Pa., won a homestretch duel over New Jersey's Erin Donohue yesterday in the girls' Eastern States High School Cross-Country Championship at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Pudlin, a 15-year-old junior at the Baldwin School, overcame a tiring Donohue in the final 30 yards to clock 14 minutes 41 seconds on the hilly 2.5-mile course. The girls' event was the featured race at the 28th annual Manhattan College High School Invitational, which had 9,800 entries from more than 300 schools in 14 states.</p>
        <p>In summerlike weather that slowed performances, Donohue, the 1999 New Jersey champion from Haddonfield High, led the field through the hills. But when Donohue wavered, Pudlin moved ahead to victory by a stride. I had one more burst, Pudlin said. Donohue, a senior, finished in 14:42. ''I just ran out of gas,''she said.</p>
        <p>Danielle Coon ran 15:00 to finish third and pace Saratoga Springs High to a fifth team championship.</p>
        <p>Boys team winners in the equal varsity divisions were Danbury (Conn.), Cherokee (N.J.), Bethlehem (N.Y.), Christian Brothers Academy (N.J.), Bishop Hendricken (R.I.) and Chaminade (N.Y.). The day's fastest times were 12:35 by Charles Millioen of St. Anthony's on Long Island and Austin Smith of Midlothian, Va., in separate victories.</p>
