        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I'm from the old school of audiences: I like to sit quietly and let the performers (who are paid to perform) do the work [''Audiences Today Are Getting in on the Act'' by Brendan Lemon, Oct. 8]. ''Make me part of the entertainment, make me part of the payroll'' is my motto. Show biz folk learned long ago that the easiest way to entertain audiences is to make them entertain themselves. But I rather resent it: audience participation signals to me that the company didn't do its homework. I find it embarrassing to be acknowledged by a cast member; I came to the theater to forget myself. If you want to watch giggling audience members acting self-conscious, you can stay home and see it on David Letterman free.</p>

        <p>Of course, you're a fool if you go to something like ''Sing-A-Long Sound of Music'' and expect the audience to sit like stones. There's a time and a place. But encouraging audience participation in mainstream shows? It may be a way to win the battle of the ever-shortening audience attention span, but theater will lose the war in the long run. What's next, interactive surgery?</p>
