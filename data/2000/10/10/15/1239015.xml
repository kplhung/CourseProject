        <p>What began as an uncontroversial plan to build 69 moderate-income apartments north of Central Park has disintegrated into a battle over  what to call the neighborhood where the housing will be built.</p>
        <p>The site for the project, being developed by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, is named the Central Park North Urban Renewal Area. The 23-block area lies north of the park and extends as far north as 127th Street.</p>
        <p>But some members of Community Board 10, which covers the neighborhood, fear that the name may stick and thus chip away at the identity of what has been called Central Harlem. ''People come into our community and change our names for us,'' said Stanley Gleaton, the chairman. ''We as a community board feel that we would like to be able to dictate what we are called.''</p>
        <p>The city insists it is not trying to rename the area. ''In the 33-year history of the agency, we have never named a neighborhood and don't intend to do so now,'' said Carol Abrams, a housing department spokeswoman. ''Real estate agents and journalists try to name neighborhoods. We don't.''</p>
        <p>She said the department named the area after Central Park North to distinguish the project from eight other renewal areas that have some variant of Harlem in their names.</p>
        <p>The community board will submit a resolution this week asking that the site be renamed the Harlem Urban Renewal Area. ''In a very slow, systematic way they're trying to take what is Harlem and give it a new face,'' Mr. Gleaton said. ''We're trying very desperately to preserve what we know as the Harlem that everyone around the country knows.''</p>
        <p>Bettijean Miller, president of the Harlem Gateway Committee, has fought for more than 20 years to have the area labeled Central Park North, arguing that the blocks around Central Park North should have their own identity. She has persuaded the city to rename 110th Street and its subway station Central Park North.</p>
        <p>''I'd like people to be more adaptable to this area being Central Park North because it is Central Park North,'' Ms. Miller said. ''It's north of the park.''</p>
