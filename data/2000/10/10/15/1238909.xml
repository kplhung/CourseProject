        <p>KEW GARDENS, Queens, is the kind of place where many pedestrians will not cross the street until the sign says ''Walk'' and will not feel sheepish about waiting to cross, even when there is no traffic.</p>
        <p>Maybe this behavior reflects the fact that many of the people who live in the neighborhood do so because they want to live in a place that is decidedly not cut from the same frenetic cloth as much of the city, or maybe it is just because many of the streets are curved and hilly and a pedestrian can never seem to see far enough down the road to find out if cars are coming.</p>

        <p>KEW GARDENS, Queens, is the kind of place where many pedestrians will not cross the street until the sign says ''Walk'' and will not feel sheepish about waiting to cross, even when there is no traffic.</p>
        <p>Maybe this behavior reflects the fact that many of the people who live in the neighborhood do so because they want to live in a place that is decidedly not cut from the same frenetic cloth as much of the city, or maybe it is just because many of the streets are curved and hilly and a pedestrian can never seem to see far enough down the road to find out if cars are coming.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood started out as a genteel garden suburb, and despite intense development pressure because of its location at the confluence of a number of highways and subway lines, a number of vigorous community associations have worked hard to keep it as close to that ideal as possible.</p>
        <p>The area, which had been a recreation area for the residents of Richmond Hill, was first developed at the turn of the century by Albon Man, a lawyer who turned his attention to real estate development, and his son Alrick. ''They believed, like the builders of Central Park did -- Olmsted and Vaux -- that if you were surrounded by green, you would be renewed,'' said Barry Lewis, a 30-year resident of Kew Gardens, an architectural historian and author of ''Kew Gardens: Urban Village in the Big City.'' ''Your mind, psychologically, could relax; it could kind of heal up from all the assaults of the modern day commercial existence.''</p>
        <p>The neighborhood is served by the E and the F subway lines, the Long Island Rail Road and the Grand Central, Van Wyck and Jackie Robinson (formerly the Interborough) Parkways. It is roughly halfway between John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports -- and is sometimes called ''Crew Gardens'' because it is host to many pilots and flight attendants, who can often be found at night at the neighborhood's bars.</p>
        <p>With such an accessible location, development pressures on the area have been high ever since the railroad came through in 1910. The Kew Gardens Civic Association, which includes owners of single-family and two-family homes, was formed in 1914. ''We try to maintain the quality of life in Kew Gardens that brought us here,'' said Murray H. Berger, the chairman of the board of the civic association. ''The private homes and a sprinkling of larger buildings have provided a good mix.''</p>
        <p>The early single-family homes, often Tudor or colonial style, still predominate in many of the neighborhood's residential lanes, where the cicadas and leaf blowers drown out the sounds of distant traffic on Metropolitan Avenue. On some of the most desirable streets, which are a short walk to the Kew Gardens L.I.R.R. station, like Grosvenor Lane, Audley Street, Abingdon Road and Park Lane South, single-family homes usually cost between $425,000 and $975,000.</p>
        <p>In the more developed parts of the neighborhood, generally areas closer to Queens Boulevard and along Lefferts Boulevard and Metropolitan Avenue, there are a number of midrise apartment buildings. Among the most prestigious are the Shellball, Hampton Court, the Beverly House, the Curzon House and the Georgian House -- all built before World War II. The vast majority of the apartments in Kew Gardens are co-ops, real estate agents said; most rental apartment buildings in the neighborhood converted in the early 1980's to co-ops.</p>
        <p>WITH their arched entrances between rooms, large windows, eat-in kitchens and inviting foyers, apartments in these older buildings, which contain about 70 percent of the apartments in the area, are typically about 25 percent taller than the area's postwar apartment towers.</p>
        <p>''The problem with the postwar buildings is that they're boxier and their ceilings are lower,'' said Varnua Singh, the owner of Crossings Realty on Lefferts Boulevard. ''Space became a premium after the 50's.''</p>
        <p>One-bedroom apartments in the Shellball, a 10-story co-op on Talbot Street, just off Lefferts Boulevard, sell for $70,000 to $79,000, Mr. Singh said, while two-bedroom apartments sell for $130,000 to $160,000.</p>
        <p>By contrast, one-bedroom apartments in the Texas, a seven-story co-op on Austin Street built in 1956 by Sam LeFrak, have recently sold for $65,000 to $68,500, said Ken Oppenheimer of Delkap Management, the building's managing agent.</p>
        <p>One frequent favorable comment from people looking to buy homes in the area is the neighborhood's feeling of community, said Mr. Singh, who remembers coming to the neighborhood for the first time in 1969, when Kew Gardens Road was unpaved. ''Even though you're in the city, it feels like a small town,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Helping to create the small-town feeling in the neighborhood around the train station is the Bliss Gourmet Cafe on Austin Street just steps from the New York-bound platform, where the owner, Wendy Brendel, serves coffee and McBliss egg sandwiches to customers, many of whom she knows by name. Her shop is busiest in the morning rush as commuters bound for Pennsylvania Station line up for coffee and doughnuts, but in the afternoon it quiets down, and Ms. Brendel manages the place by herself.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brendel said people often ask her, why not avoid the work and sell the shop to Starbucks. ''I would never do that, just on principle,'' she said. ''I can't really imagine a Starbucks here.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, there seem to be remarkably few national chains in the neighborhood, in part reflecting its great diversity. Kew Gardens has long served as a place where new groups of immigrants come to get a foothold in the United States.</p>
        <p>. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, there was an influx of Iranian Jews into the neighborhood. Their numbers have declined as many have moved to Nassau County and other suburban areas, realtors said.</p>
        <p>After the 1990 collapse of the Soviet Union, people from former Soviet republics, particularly Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, arrived, and there are many people from India and Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries, including Yemen and Egypt, and from Central and South America.</p>
        <p>On a strip of Lefferts Boulevard, which is the heart of the neighborhood, one can find Regents Row, which is a new Irish restaurant and bar; the Romashka Russian grocery store, which has Russian newspapers, Russian caviar and Russian yogurt; the Uzbekistan Cultural Center; and Coconuts, a Caribbean nightclub under construction.</p>
        <p>Balancing these cosmopolitan influences at its center, the neighborhood also retains its rustic qualities with the help of Forest Park, which borders Kew Gardens on the southwest. ''There are no cars allowed -- it's just continuous green,'' said Dennis Pahl, a professor of English at Long Island University, who has lived in Kew Gardens for six years and said he walks or rides his bicycle through the park to relax. ''It's nice to know you can find this incredible tranquility by walking to the park or just walking down the side streets.''</p>
        <p>The biggest problem facing Kew Gardens, according to the chairwoman of the local community board, Sylvia Hack, is the construction of what she termed ''architecturally insignificant houses.'' She mentioned a new cluster of townhouses being built on Talbot Street that are set back from the street far enough to give each townhouse a parking spot in front of the buildings. ''We're getting the kind of development that turns a someplace into a no place,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood has one public elementary school, P.S. 99, a magnet school for students interested in law. It is undergoing a $4.2 million exterior renovation that should be completed in the spring of 2001, said the principal, Judith Ibrahimi. A few years ago the school, which now holds 615 children in kindergarten through sixth grade, was so crowded that kindergarteners had to be bused to P.S. 144 in Forest Hills. But after the 1993-94 school year, the Kew Gardens Improvement Association, the board of education, the school and parents worked together to build the P.S. 99 Annex just down the street from the main building. The annex now houses slightly more than 400 students in the kindergarten, first grade and second grade.</p>
        <p>Sixty-five percent of the children at the school read at or above grade level, well above the citywide average. ''We don't want anybody to be anonymous,'' Ms. Ibrahimi said. ''We're working very hard, and we're doing that with an immigrant population.''</p>
        <p>MOST public school students from Kew Gardens go on Russell Sage Junior High School, in Forest Hills, which has an enrollment of about 1,425 students in the seventh, eighth and ninth grades. The school is one of the few in the city to offer Latin, and it is usually among the top performing 25 percent of junior high or middle schools in the city.</p>
        <p>The designated high school for Kew Gardens is Hillcrest High School in Jamaica.</p>
        <p>There are also four Jewish schools in Kew Gardens. Yeshiva Shaar Hatorah-Grodno, founded in 1977 and named for a yeshiva in Poland that was destroyed in World War II, serves young men of high school and college age from around the world. Yeshivat Ohr Haiim serves boys and girls from kindergarten to eighth grade. The Bais Yaakov Academy, which has an enrollment of about 800, serves girls in kindergarten to eighth grade. Tifereth Moshe, an Orthodox school on Abingdon Road, is for boys in kindergarten to eighth grade.</p>
        <p>Though there are no Catholic schools in Kew Gardens, residents send their children to two nearby schools: Our Lady of the Cenacle School in Richmond Hill and Our Lady Queen of Martyrs School in Forest Hills. The schools serve students in prekindergarten to eighth grade and have about 325 students each.</p>
        <p>The future of Kew Gardens depends on different things for different people. Mr. Pahl said he hoped that the New York economy would continue to thrive, encouraging more Manhattanites to move to the area, and that the Kew Gardens Cinema would flourish, encouraging more community and small business development. ''I think it's a 50-50 shot that this place is going to continue to reinvigorate,'' he said, noting that it had already come a long way from six years ago, when many now-successful storefronts were vacant.</p>
        <p>Though he may worry about too much development, Mr. Berger, who spent 20 years as president of the Kew Gardens Civic Association, said the neighborhood is still special to him. ''It's always been a tree-blessed area -- it looks like an oasis in an otherwise tenementlike city,'' he said. ''We're a mixed community in religion and in ethnicity, and pretty much everybody's free to do his own thing without peer pressure in the background.''</p>
