        <p>The presidential campaign turned again toward the Middle East today, as Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush talked of hope and prayers for peace and their aides battled over charges that the Bush camp was exploiting the turmoil for political gain.</p>
        <p>On a day that the vice president  attacked Mr. Bush on policy issues, Mr. Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, accused Republicans of ''injecting campaign rhetoric and presidential politics'' into the crisis.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, used events in the Middle East to bolster calls for decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil and for strengthening the military. ''Given the situation, people ought to be careful, be responsible,'' Mr. Lehane said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's senior adviser, Ari Fleischer, dismissed today's accusation as a smoke screen.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Lehane's comments are a mark of Al Gore's weak leadership at a time when his campaign is struggling,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''The crisis in the Middle East should not prevent our nation from discussing the implications of this administration's failure to have an energy policy. Governor Bush will continue to credit the administration in its efforts to stop the violence in the Middle East, but he will not hesitate to critique the administration's failed energy policies.''</p>
        <p>The candidates themselves were more circumspect. Mr. Bush, who was in Texas preparing for Tuesday's debate, issued a statement after President Clinton announced a summit on Monday in Egypt: ''I welcome this development. I hope that Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Barak will do everything possible to stop the violence so that our longstanding goal of peace in the Middle East can be achieved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said his prayers were with the families of the sailors killed and injured in the attack on the Navy destroyer in Yemen.</p>
        <p>''We're praying as well for the success of the summit meeting that's going to be held on Monday,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore continued: ''As we grieve for those who were affected by the violence there, we think not only of the Americans, we think also of the Palestinians and the Israelis and the suffering that the families on both sides have felt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehane said the summit would not alter Mr. Gore's schedule, which called for him to leave Washington on Sunday evening for St. Louis, where he will prepare for the debate.</p>
        <p>At a rally in this fiercely contested state today, Mr. Gore delivered a spirited, turn-the-tables speech to a partisan crowd by accusing Mr. Bush of using ''fuzzy math'' to justify his policies on tax cuts, Social Security and health care.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush introduced that term into the campaign when he used it repeatedly to criticize Mr. Gore in their first debate. Today, Mr. Gore appropriated the phrase, even as he argued that the differences between him and Mr. Bush were more about priorities than numbers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's tone was notably vigorous and aggressive, a discernible change from his flat delivery in a speech in Iowa on Friday. He confidently, almost mockingly, assailed Mr. Bush for his campaign proposals and his record as governor.</p>
        <p>After telling of a health maintenance organization that had declined to pay for the treatment of a heart attack because it was not considered an emergency, Mr. Gore said, ''To those on the other side, maybe the absence of a heart isn't considered an emergency, but to us it is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore arrived in Michigan only a day after Mr. Bush departed and as a new poll showed Mr. Bush gaining on Mr. Gore in Michigan..</p>
        <p>The poll, taken on Wednesday and Thursday by EPIC/MRA, a Lansing firm, gave Mr. Gore a lead of 45 percent to 42 percent over Mr. Bush. That gap was within the margin of sampling error of four percentage points.</p>
        <p>Previous polls by the same organization had Mr. Gore ahead by six  percentage points in late September and by eight percentage points in mid-September.</p>
        <p>Speaking to a crowd dominated by union members and African-Americans, Mr. Gore charged that Mr. Bush has failed to explain how he would pay for his proposal to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security deductions in the stock market, at an estimated cost of $1 trillion. That plan would eventually bankrupt the system, Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>''They promise not to cut Social Security benefits, a promise that can only be kept by also using that same $1 trillion to continue paying the benefits at the current level,'' he said. ''Now if you take $1 trillion and promise it to two different groups and it doesn't show up in the budget, fuzzy math, fuzzy math.''</p>
        <p>He also used a study released this week by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, to assert that Mr. Bush had been wrong when he said in Wednesday's debate that ''the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.''</p>
        <p>The study found that monthly enrollments in Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, have declined in Texas by 7.6 percent between June 1997 and December 1999, while enrollment in the country as a whole increased by 2.3 percent during that period.</p>
        <p>''What I believe I heard last week was him saying the uninsured population in America went up and the uninsured population in Texas went down,'' Mr. Gore said of Mr. Bush. ''But what the figures seem to show is exactly the reverse. Now what is the phrase that describes that kind of calculation?''</p>
        <p>''Fuzzy math!'' the crowd shouted.</p>
        <p>''I believe you're right,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Fuzzy math.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Gore had distorted the study by failing to acknowledge that the economy in Texas had raised incomes and therefore reduced the number of people eligible for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>''While there was a 7.6 percent drop in Texas Medicaid enrollment,'' Mr. Bartlett said, ''there was also an 11 percent drop in the number of people eligible for Medicaid.''</p>
