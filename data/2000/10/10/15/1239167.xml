        <p>A thin, sporadic drizzle mixed with the chilled northerly breeze did nothing to raise the comfort level of the gathering throng. But this is a sailor's town, and last Monday the blast of unseasonable weather did nothing to dissuade the locals from assembling on the waterfront for what has become an annual boating spectacle.</p>
        <p>Lining the docks and stationed in upper-deck perches on hotel balconies -- and, in many instances, fortified by rum-laced painkillers from an adjacent saloon -- the crowd had come to witness and cheer the rapid disassembly of the United States Sailboat Show, an operation of nautical choreography that must be seen to be believed.</p>
        <p>At precisely 6 p.m., as it does each Columbus Day, an announcement hailing the end of the country's largest in-the-water sailboat show was bellowed through the public-address system. It might have been synonymous for, ''Let the games begin.''</p>
        <p>The festive atmosphere was heightened by the whiff of potential disaster that wafted in the air. For when the goal is to move well over 200 yachts of varying size and description in an hour or two, the possibility of a gleaming new hull having a rendezvous with a solid old pier is ever present.</p>
        <p>The exercise is complicated by the fact that as soon as the sailboats have exited, an entire fleet of powerboats begins to fill the vacated berths in anticipation of the United States Powerboat Show, which started on Thursday and continues through Sunday.</p>
        <p>Overnight, the view over the City Docks in downtown Annapolis, for days dominated by a forest of masts, becomes open and sparless. For all boaters but for sailors especially, it is a strange and somewhat disorienting transformation.</p>
        <p>Then again, so is the entire metamorphosis, which is something like watching a real-life staging of time-lapse photography. Things happen very quickly.</p>
        <p>Whole rafts of linked docks are towed out to make way. Throttles are dropped and boats fire through the narrowest of openings. It becomes apparent that what had appeared to be a full-service, modern marina was really a temporary staging area extending well into the harbor.</p>
        <p>This year, despite the nasty north wind, there were close calls but no incidents. The skipper of the 57-foot catamaran Crazy Horse earned wild applause for extricating his giant platform from an impossibly tight position. So too did the crew of a new J/80 racer, who smartly hightailed it under spinnaker and without engine.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1970, the sailboat show, which organizers say averages about 50,000 attendees over its five-day span, has become a major date on the calendar of manufacturers and suppliers.</p>
        <p>''If you're not here, you're not a player,'' Jay Lebow, a yacht broker, said. ''This is the only show we wouldn't miss. It's been able to accomplish something the others haven't. If you're in the sailboat industry, it's the place you have to be.''</p>
        <p>While the powerboat show is also a major local event, it does not hold the broader cachet of its all-sail sibling.</p>
        <p>''The powerboat show is more regional,'' said Jim Barthold, the general manager for both events. ''This is as close to a national or international sailboat show as there is in this country, especially in terms of visitors, who travel from all over to come here.''</p>
        <p>Mike Lechelop from Beneteau Yachts, whose company's 47-footer, designed by Jean-Marie Finot, was making its debut in Annapolis, said: ''There is no comparison to this show and the others. It signals the start of the new model year and it draws a crowd that really makes it an event.''</p>
        <p>Along with the crowds, the assemblage of new boats included a long list of overseas imports. Notable among them were the Sydney 38, a flat-out racing boat from Australia; the South African-built Shearwater 45, a husky offshore cruiser designed by Dudley Dix; and the Hans Christian Explorer 4750 from the naval architect Chuck Paine, another long-distance passage maker that is produced in Thailand.</p>
        <p>Among the offerings from domestic builders were the HC 50, a fast offshore voyager from Hunter Marine; the Schock 40, a radical racing boat from the Schock Corporation, a longtime California builder; and the innovative Shoalsailer 32, a fun coastal cruiser with a shallow draft from Rhode Island's Shannon Yachts.</p>
        <p>But wherever they come from, when the final signal is sounded, they all depart from the downtown show grounds in a rush. And for some who live and work in the area, it is a rite of passage.</p>
        <p>''It's a spectator sport, but it's also emotional,'' said Nancy Cann, the president of Crusader Yacht Sales in Annapolis. ''It's another ritual in life. When you see that first boat leave, it's all over.''</p>
