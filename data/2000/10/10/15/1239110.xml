        <p>I read with dismay the destruction of Ellen Halloran's beloved tree (''Mourning a Humble Ailanthus,'' Soapbox, Oct. 8).

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with dismay the destruction of Ellen Halloran's beloved tree (''Mourning a Humble Ailanthus,'' Soapbox, Oct. 8). I too lived in the Village with a similar green canopy of trees that have mercifully survived in an odd little green lot on Downing Street, thanks to a trust, rumor has it.</p>
        <p>I can attest to the immeasurable serenity and immense pleasures that living in the arms of such a tree can provide a city dweller.</p>
        <p>But the point is, who makes the decisions that the trees have to go, and are these decisions monitored? Are considerations given to the plus side of ''watchful waiting'' for a tree that has been pronounced terminal? We need a tree brigade to police the (I suspect) hasty choppers who have experienced that sweet sense of urban tree bliss that comes from having your own personal city tree: winter, spring, summer and fall.</p>
