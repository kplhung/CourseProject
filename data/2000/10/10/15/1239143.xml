        <p>While the relatively muted protests in most Arab capitals on Friday fed some hope that an emergency summit meeting could revive peace talks, the emotional scars of the recent violence on both Arabs and Jews and the re-emergence of Arab nationalist themes, rhetoric and fears are likely to complicate efforts to resolve the 50-year-old Arab-Israeli struggle peacefully.</p>
        <p>Not since the outbreak of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war have Arab newspapers been so filled with the language of hate and denial that once characterized Arab political discourse toward Israel under the Egyptian Gamel Abdel Nasser, the champion of Arab nationalism.</p>
        <p>''Egypt is returning to the 1960's,'' Mahmoud Said concluded in a front-page article earlier this week in Al Sharq Al Awsat, a popular Arabic language daily newspaper.</p>
        <p>Articles in semiofficial Egyptian newspapers like Al Akhbar, for instance, have taken to calling Israel not the ''Jewish state'' or even ''the Jews,'' but the ''Zionist entity,'' the term once favored by Syria and other rejectionist Arab nations.</p>
        <p>Slogans popularized by Nasser are reappearing on Egyptian television and in the press, among them, ''What was conquered by power can only be reclaimed by power.'' A nostalgic, emotionally potent ballad about Jerusalem by the popular Lebanese singer Fairuz is being widely played on Arab radio stations.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Said pointed out that Egyptian shop owners have begun removing Israeli products from their shelves and hiding other indications of trade with Israel.</p>
        <p>Arab commentators have taken to calling the often violent rallies and demonstrations by Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza the ''Second Intifada'' -- an even more ferocious popular uprising than the first stone-throwing rebellion against Israel in the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>''For the first time in a long, long time,'' wrote Marwan Asmar, a staff writer in The Star, a Jordanian English-language weekly, ''people are expressing their true selves, reaching for a pan-Arab idea that until now has been blocked by the creation of states, statism, geography and boundaries.''</p>
        <p>The outpouring of emotion and support was a ''reminder of the Arab world of the 1950's and 1960's, when the flag of nationalism was flying,'' he added.</p>
        <p>''While that era was long gone and buried,'' Mr. Asmar lamented, ''the tide could be turning for the first time.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone accepts the notion that Arab nationalism is being revived, or can be revived.</p>
        <p>Robert Satloff, director of the Washington Institute for Near Eastern Affairs, a pro-Israeli policy group, contends that Arab leaders then and now are simply too different. ''Today's leaders well understand that the bravado of the 1960's produced the '67 war,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The last thing wanted by President Hosni Mubarak, with his goal of joining Egypt to the global economy, or needed by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a ''self-styled Mr. Internet,'' was the ''zero-sum, lowest-common-denominator politics of the Nasser era,'' Mr. Satloff said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, even after the 1993 Oslo peace accords between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, most Arab leaders failed to promote the accords in their own countries and shied away from investing in what an Israeli writer, David Markovsky, called ''bottom-up peacemaking.'' Thus, popular support among Arabs for the peace process has lagged far behind an official understanding of how vital peace with Israel is and how important it is to the leaders' own survival and the region's prosperity.</p>
        <p>Long before the protests that followed Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount, Haram al-Sharif, several prominent Jordanian trade groups and professional associations, including the influential journalists' union, expelled members who openly had contacts with their Israeli counterparts.</p>
        <p>The absence of grass-roots and intellectual support for peace has fueled the resurgence of Arab nationalism. That, in turn, has made even staunch Israeli peace activists question whether Arabs are ready to accept the existence of a Jewish state and to live with them in peace.</p>
        <p>If not in tatters, Arab and Israeli peace movements now face enormous pressures.</p>
        <p>''While those of us who met with Israelis and extended our hand in friendship faced problems before, we're in an impossible situation now,'' said Mustafa Hamarneh, director of a prominent state-supported research center in Amman. ''We can't defend our stance when 12-year-old kids are being shot by Israelis, our partners in peace.''</p>
        <p>Ihsan Shurdom, a former commander of the Jordanian Air Force and part of the Copenhagen Group, Arab and Israeli intellectuals who met at first secretly in Denmark in 1996 to promote peace, articulated the widespread despair within the peace camp these days.</p>
        <p>''No matter how much we want peace, we are a part of the Jordanian population,'' Mr. Shurdom said. ''We don't have a separate peace movement. Whatever people feel, we're bound to be near it.''</p>
        <p>That is especially true in Jordan, so closely linked to the Palestinians by geography and its own people, more than 50 percent of whom are of Palestinian origin.</p>
        <p>''When someone is killed in Hebron on the West Bank,'' Mr. Shurdom said, ''a relative opens his house for condolences in Amman. It's one country more or less. So the last two weeks have been devastating for us.''</p>
        <p>In Cairo, peace activists have also paid a price. Two of the most prominent Egyptian proponents of peace and ''normalization'' -- Saad Eddin Ibrahim, director of a pro-democracy research center that was closed earlier this year by the Egyptian government, and Eli Salem, a prominent writer -- were arrested shortly after attending a university-sponsored conference in Tel Aviv last May. And earlier this week, two Egyptian members of the Copenhagen Group resigned.</p>
        <p>''The peace campaign is really isolated now,'' said Hani Hurrani, director of New Jordan, a nongovernmental research center in Amman that reports on social and economic trends. ''We feel that we have to go underground.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps an even more profound emotional scar of the recent violence is the rift between Israeli Jews and the Arab citizens of Israel, now nearly 20 percent of the population. Thousands of Arab Israelis took to the streets to protest not only Israel's killings of fellow Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza, but also their own status as second-class citizens in a Jewish state. Israeli Jews were horrified by the ferocity of this uprising, which closed off large sections of their country, and by the ''Death to the Jews'' slogans chanted by the Arab protesters.</p>
        <p>''We are the Arab-Israeli issue that goes deepest,'' said Lutfi Mashur, the editor of Al Sinara, an Arabic biweekly and an ardent proponent of peace between Jews and Arabs. ''We are the Jews' main Arab problem.''</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that the riots and Jewish fears of an internal front in the event of another Arab-Israeli war -- Israel's worst nightmare -- Mr. Mashur said his community would have to work hard to heal the deep rift with Israel's majority.</p>
        <p>''We must convince the Jews that what the young people did was not directed against them, but against the discrimination against them,'' he said. ''We must convince them that while we sympathize with the suffering of the Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza, we feel Israeli. We are part of this state. But younger Arab citizens of Israel are no longer willing to tolerate being illegitimate in their own state.''</p>
