        <p>Johnson's Ropa Usada, a concrete-and-cinder-block warehouse in the Texas border town McAllen, is the final resting place for some of the detritus of American consumer culture. The massive building is cooled by a giant, cacophonous fan. White light pours down from skylights. And strewn across the floor in huge, heaping mounds, like a brilliantly striated mountain range, are piles upon piles of used clothes. On Saturdays, the clothes go on sale for 30 cents a pound.</p>
        <p>As America's primary economy has boomed, so has its secondhand economy; in 1997, Americans spent about $12 billion on used goods, 30 percent more than they did in 1992. And it's estimated that Americans give away as much as 2.5 billion pounds of clothes each year, much of which eventually arrives in a place like this. Increasingly, used goods from the United States are also sold in vast quantities to the third world. ''We now export between $500 million and $1 billion worth of used clothing per year,'' says Daniel Rothenberg, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan. Johnson's represents the frontier in this expanding secondhand economy -- the last point at which used clothes are sold to Americans, and the first point at which they are sold to foreigners.</p>
        <p>Inside Johnson's, customers scale and pick their way across the fabric heights. Francisco Villarreal chugs around on a forklift, moving bales throughout the warehouse. When I ask him where the clothes come from, he says: ''New Jersey. Todas para New Jersey.'' A company there buys leftover clothing from Goodwill and the Salvation Army, then sells the used goods to Johnson's.</p>
        <p>Small kids play tag on a mountain of clothes, and a bigger boy does back flips onto them. He stops when he finds a pair of black snow pants that he seems to love. From the bottom of a crater, Minerva Villegas picks up an item, glances at it and tosses it over her shoulder. ''If you have problems,'' she says as she digs in deeper, ''well, this helps. It opens your mind, like church.'' Her husband is a roofer in McAllen who works for minimum wage. ''All my clothes are from here,'' she says. ''My bras, my panties -- everything.''</p>
        <p>A few piles away, a dapper old man works furiously. Salvador Acuna Aparicios bends to pick up an item, tosses it away, picks up another, tosses it away, picks up a T-shirt and slings it over his shoulder. He lives in Nuevo Laredo, on the Mexican side of the border. ''I've had my local crossing card since 1957,'' he tells me. ''I'm 72 years old, but I exercise a lot. I box. I take good care of myself. And I don't like to be idle. I am a widower, and I don't like to spend my time sitting down, because I get nostalgic.'' As he speaks, Aparicios keeps sorting the clothing at a furious pace, salvaging T-shirts. ''I take them to a lady in Nuevo Laredo, for resale,'' he explains. ''I don't charge her anything for them.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, Rebecca Vasquez is looking for school clothes for her children. ''If you can't afford new things, this is where you go,'' she says. She works for $150 a week putting stickers that say Off and On onto television remote controls. ''All my clothes are from here,'' she says. ''I don't buy new clothes. For my kids, I do, once in a while, but everything else comes from here.'' Vasquez pulls out a pink skirt with a gray felt cat on it. ''My daughters will wear this,'' she announces. ''Fix it up, little shoes -- the 50's!'' Her 9-year-old son, the same kid who was doing back flips, parades by in an army jumpsuit. ''Come here,'' she orders. ''Turn around. No holes? O.K., good.'' Then she spots what he's hiding -- the snow pants. ''No!'' she tells him. ''I told you! It never gets cold here!''</p>
        <p>In another part of the warehouse, shy Mexican women pick through clothing as a transistor radio plays. They work for a man who sells American castoffs in Mexico. What they find will be shipped south by truck to Guanajuato to be sold at an outdoor market. Most of the people who shop here don't give much thought to those who are forever buying ropa nueva. If they think of them at all, it is with a kind of puzzled curiosity. ''I don't know why they get rid of these things,'' says Aparicios. ''Maybe it is related to the fact that there was a sickness in the family.''</p>
        <p>Minerva Villegas adds: ''If they want to waste their money that way, it's their business. It's none of my business, what people do with their money.'' From her pillowcase, now lumpy with clothes, Villegas pulls out a plaid work shirt for her husband. ''If he doesn't like it, I'll give it to my brother,'' she says. ''And if nobody in my family wants it, then I'll put it in the back of Kmart, for those guys who sleep in the middle of the highway.''</p>
