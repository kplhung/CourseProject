        <p>Most of his teammates lean back to catch their breath between shifts, but Randy McKay always props an elbow on the boards and leans forward, as if he is ready to propel himself back on the ice at a moment's notice.</p>
        <p>McKay is 33 and coming off a 16-goal season in which he nursed a bad shoulder, but he had surgery during the off-season and says he feels great. He is still important to the Devils because he has resumed doing the unglamorous jobs. One of them is finding a spot in front of the other team's goal and refusing to move.</p>
        <p>He scored two goals, his first since March 24, in the Devils' 4-2 victory tonight over the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Neither was Gretkzyesque. McKay deflected in a shot for the first of the Devils' three power-play goals, and he got his second by taking a pass and thrusting it between the legs of goaltender Guy Hebert.</p>
        <p>That is exactly what McKay is supposed to do.</p>
        <p>''He's a leader, a guy who's been around here for a long time, and he plays his heart out,'' Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur said. ''Just look at his face, all the scars on it. That shows you how hard he plays. He needs to bump and grind to be successful.''</p>
        <p>McKay also had an assist on Bobby Holik's second goal of the game, both of which came on the power play. The Devils, just 1 for 8 with a man advantage in the first two games of the season without the unsigned Jason Arnott and Scott Niedermayer, were 3 for 5 tonight with a unit that had been  juggled by Slava Fetisov, the assistant coach.</p>
        <p>The Devils dominated, opening a four-goal lead and outshooting Anaheim by 27-10 in the first two periods. Ladislav Kohn scored a short-handed goal and Teemu Selanne beat Brodeur with a power-play blast from the face-off circle with 11 minutes left, but Anaheim made its charge way too late.</p>
        <p>''The little things make this team good,'' Holik said. ''It's not just the power play. It's all the little things we do.''</p>
        <p>McKay played in only 67 regular-season games last year, the fewest in any of his nine full seasons with the team. His shoulder was not the only body part bothering him: He missed seven games with a sore ankle, four games with a strained hip flexor and a game against Ottawa, according to the Devils' media guide, because of ''general soreness.''</p>
        <p>''Randy is the type of guy who goes in there and does a lot of the bumping, and gets bumped, and battles in front of the net,'' Devils Coach Larry Robinson said. ''It puts a lot of wear and tear on you.''</p>
        <p>McKay did not miss any of the Devils' 23 games in the Stanley Cup playoffs last year, but he did not score a goal and said he was ailing. Two weeks after the season, he underwent surgery.</p>
        <p>''It had no strength anymore,'' he said of his shoulder. ''I think it was probably always in the back of my mind, too.''</p>
        <p>Tonight's game was a good example of how too much rest can sometimes be a bad thing in hockey. The Devils had a week off before their game Friday at Ottawa, and they played listlessly and lost, 3-1.</p>
        <p>''It definitely helped after a poor performance to have a chance to correct ourselves,'' Holik said. ''It worked out pretty good. We had a chance to redeem ourselves.''</p>
        <p>With German Titov in the penalty box in the first period for slashing John Madden, the Devils pushed the puck into the Ducks' zone and kept it there. Colin White found some open ice at the blue line, took a pass from Petr Sykora and slapped the puck toward Hebert.</p>
        <p>McKay had planted himself in front of Hebert, and he got his stick on White's shot. The puck wobbled past Hebert, and the Devils had a 1-0 lead just minutes 23 seconds into the game.</p>
        <p>McKay scored again at the 12:21 mark of the second period. Steve Kelly whisked a pass across the slot to McKay, who had found some space alone in front of the net. At first it looked as if McKay had fanned on the shot, but he put enough on it to get the puck between Hebert's legs.</p>
        <p>Hebert was chased from the game not long after that. The Devils scored their third power-play goal when Holik gathered in a loose puck in front of the net and backhanded it past Hebert, who had strayed too far to his left.</p>
        <p>Dominic Roussel replaced Hebert in goal for the Ducks, and Hebert went to the bench and watched the rest of the game from a corner.</p>
