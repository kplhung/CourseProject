        <p>AT 5:30 Monday morning my phone rang. Oh, swell, I thought, somebody died. But it was good news. My brother, Paul Greengard, was calling. ''I just won the Nobel Prize,'' he said. He sounded as though he didn't want to talk too loudly for fear his head would fall off.</p>
        <p>It's a head filled with things I have never understood. I admire and love my brother, but he lives on a higher plane, and what he does is secret, unrevealable. To me, anyway. Once, when he was a young man going off to some lab or other, I asked what he was going to do that day. ''I am going to pith a frog,'' he said. Whatever that meant, it didn't sound good for the frog, and that was the end of my prying into his life in science.</p>

        <p>AT 5:30 Monday morning my phone rang. Oh, swell, I thought, somebody died. But it was good news. My brother, Paul Greengard, was calling. ''I just won the Nobel Prize,'' he said. He sounded as though he didn't want to talk too loudly for fear his head would fall off.</p>
        <p>It's a head filled with things I have never understood. I admire and love my brother, but he lives on a higher plane, and what he does is secret, unrevealable. To me, anyway. Once, when he was a young man going off to some lab or other, I asked what he was going to do that day. ''I am going to pith a frog,'' he said. Whatever that meant, it didn't sound good for the frog, and that was the end of my prying into his life in science.</p>
        <p>My mother said it was O.K. for me to turn away from scientific inquiry. ''We don't need another genius around here,'' she declared, thereby demolishing all three of us siblings with a single sentence -- my sister and me, because we weren't so smart, and my brother, because he was too smart for her taste.</p>
        <p>At 17, he joined the Navy and helped develop an early warning radar system to detect incoming Japanese planes. That's the last thing I remotely understood about his world.</p>
        <p>Every girl thinks her big brother is smarter and more glamorous than the next guy. My brother was. He even sang like an angel. And he kept moving. ''It is not worthwhile to go around the world to count the cats in Zanzibar,'' said Thoreau, but my brother didn't agree.</p>
        <p>After the war, he went to Hamilton College and got a degree in two years. I didn't know what he did there.</p>
        <p>Then he went to Johns Hopkins and worked in a lab all night and got his Ph.D. I didn't know what he did there, either. It wasn't that he refused to tell me, it's just that I couldn't make head or tails of it. He was a fool for education. I couldn't sit through a class without daydreaming -- so I elected a life in art. While my brother was in Britain, on a fellowship to Cambridge, I got my first acting part in a movie by a young director named Stanley Kubrick. My brother could follow what I was doing, but his pursuits remained impenetrable to me.</p>
        <p>In the late 1950's, he came back to the United States. He worked at the National Institutes of Health in Washington and then at Geigy Research Laboratories in New York. I'd go to dinner with friends, and someone would ask, ''What is your brother doing?'' ''I don't know,'' I would say. ''He's a genius, and they do all different stuff.'' They wouldn't have understood, anyway.</p>
        <p>But I did know he was involved in something exciting and mysterious, because every time he took a new job -- whether at Albert Einstein College of Medicine or Yale -- I'd ask him about it. Then he'd get into electro-physiological properties, and it was all over.</p>
        <p>When he went south, to Vanderbilt University, I made the mistake of asking what he would be researching. ''Thermodynamics of the adenylyl cyclase reaction,'' he said. That scared me so that I switched the subject to myself. I'd say, ''I'm singing in this Broadway show called 'Tenderloin,' and George Abbot is the director and Maurice Evans drives me home.'' Or: ''I'm playing a juvenile delinquent in this soap opera called 'Love of Life.' '' Nothing intimidating there. No adenylyl cyclase involved, nothing that would make a person cry.</p>
        <p>FATED to be singed by the fires of intellectual achievement burning all around me, I accepted my lot and married a guy whose mother was Mary Chase. Back in the 1940's, she had won a Pulitzer Prize for her play ''Harvey.'' Meanwhile, I still didn't know what my brother did.</p>
        <p>But my opinion of my brother's greatness was confirmed by others who kept giving him dinners and awards. The food part was fine, but when they got to the talking part, I was back to square one.</p>
        <p>In 1983, Paul came to Rockefeller University in New York, to become the Vincent Astor professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience.</p>
        <p>Now, he has won the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine, an honor he shares with two other scientists. In reporting it, the newspapers said their work on the way brain cells communicate might one day help cure diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.</p>
        <p>I'm thrilled he won. Now I know what he does.</p>
