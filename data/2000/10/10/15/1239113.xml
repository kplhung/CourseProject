        <p>''If not  for Howie Zibel  ''</p>
        <p>That phrase came up repeatedly in recent months as charges of ethical misconduct rocked the New Hampshire Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors investigated; one justice resigned in disgrace; the State House of Representatives impeached the court's chief justice, David Brock; weeks of Senate trial followed; on Tuesday, Chief Justice Brock was acquitted.</p>
        <p>And, indeed, all this might never have happened, the ethically questionable moments in the court might never have become public and been corrected, if not for Howard J. Zibel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zibel (rhymes with quibble) is the court's clerk, and at base, he said today, ''I lead a very dull life.''</p>
        <p>Not dull in a bad way. Not at all: he has been married for 28 years to the same woman, they have two beloved daughters, and the usual big event of Mr. Zibel's year might be judging a contest among high school students speaking about the Constitution. As court clerk, he schedules cases, helps lawyers understand procedural issues, that kind of thing.</p>
        <p>Dull, however, is the last word anyone would apply to Mr. Zibel's life lately.</p>
        <p>The disruption began on Feb. 4. At a meeting, Chief Justice Brock announced which judges he had appointed to a panel that would hear the divorce case of one of the court's own justices, W. Stephen Thayer III. Justice Thayer objected strenuously to the choice of a particular judge for that panel, and Chief Justice Brock then went to Mr. Zibel's office to ask him to hold off calling the judge to tell him of the appointment. He was too late, however. Mr. Zibel was already on the phone to the judge.</p>
        <p>When the importance of the incident sank in -- the fact that a recused justice, Justice Thayer, had tried to influence the selection of judges for his own case -- it troubled Mr. Zibel deeply. In his family, he said, he is known as the ''ethical nut.'' He is the kind of father who, when a daughter suggests, say, pretending that she is 12 instead of 13 to save $5 on a movie ticket, will ask: ''Is your integrity worth $5? Is that the price of your honesty?''</p>
        <p>He had witnessed what he believed was a breach of judicial ethics and was obligated to report it. And yet he loved the court, which he described as feeling as close-knit as a family to its employees, and liked its individual justices, including Justice Thayer, who had not been himself during his traumatic divorce. In Mr. Zibel's office hangs a decorative graphic composed of the English and Hebrew words of a verse in Deuteronomy, ''Justice, Justice Shalt Thou Pursue'' -- a spontaneous gift from Justice Sherman Horton. It was that warm a place.</p>
        <p>What to do? Mr. Zibel stared at that graphic on his office wall a lot, he said. So great was his agonizing that when he described some of it during the Senate trial, he broke into tears. He had lost his great-grandparents in Europe during the Holocaust, he said, and found himself thinking about a talk he had heard recently about how the court clerks in Vichy, France, had signed the papers for the deportation of Jewish children. Court clerks, he knew, must be the guardians of due process, helping to defend the rule of law.</p>
        <p>Just as he was wrestling with his dilemma, he testified, his daughter Cindy, who now attends Wellesley College, brought home a brochure from an exhibit on the children of Vichy. He is not much of one for signs and omens, he said, but this one struck home.</p>
        <p>During a sleepless night, he wrote what came to be known as the Zibel Memorandum, detailing three recent instances in which he believed Justice Thayer had committed breaches of ethics. He described how Justice Thayer had tried to influence the selection of judges for his own divorce case; how he had argued at a court conference on behalf of a lawyer friend whom he owed $50,000; and how he had participated in discussions of new rules for the Judicial Conduct Committee even though he had a pending case before the panel.</p>
        <p>''Until this past year, I had always been proud to be associated with the court,'' Mr. Zibel wrote.</p>
        <p>When you make such a decision, Mr. Zibel said at the trial, you bring ''your whole life story.''</p>
        <p>Asked today to elaborate on what exactly influenced his decision, he said: ''I don't know that I can pinpoint anything. It's just your whole background. It's just the way you're brought up.''</p>
        <p>The way Mr. Zibel was brought up was very modestly. His father, Simon, and mother, Adele, never did own their own apartment. He grew up in the triple-deckers of Mattapan, a working-class section of Boston; his father worked in photo finishing; his mother held jobs in a bakery and a department store. His grades got him into the prestigious Boston Latin school, and he went on to college and law school at Cornell. He met his future wife in 10th grade.</p>
        <p>Here, and later, Mr. Zibel, who is 51, chose quiet over hubbub. After graduating, he wanted to live in a small New England city, he said, and ended up taking a job in a law firm here in Concord. In 1985, after nine years, things were not quiet enough: he decided to take a clerk's job at the court, he said, in part to escape the annoyances of billing and dealing with clients, in part to have more time for his family.</p>
        <p>''I have a reverence for the law,'' he said. ''I didn't like the clients. The billing, the headaches.''</p>
        <p>Much as he seeks to evade it, hubbub seems to follow Howard Zibel. But perhaps life can return to the quiet he seeks now. Today he even had time for lunch with his 8-year-old, Lori. .</p>
        <p>He has felt no backlash from the justices, he said. Indeed, when Mr. Zibel's wife, Gay, had a gallbladder attack this summer the day before the House impeachment vote, Chief Justice Brock called Mr. Zibel to ask how she was; and after Mr. Zibel's mother died on Labor Day, the chief justice paid a mourning call.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Zibel can be comforted that, in his view, the court's difficult days have ended well. He never thought Chief Justice Brock committed an impeachable offense, he said.</p>
        <p>And ''the really important thing,'' he added, ''and I think people lose sight of this, but the bottom line is that the system worked -- on a lot of levels.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps, one cannot help but parry, but would the system have worked, if not for Howie Zibel?</p>
        <p>''We will never know the answer to that question,'' he said. ''But this is an ethical place, where people are concerned with doing the right thing.''</p>
