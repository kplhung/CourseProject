        <p>BLUE VELVET 1929  +  (212) 260-9808; 227 First Avenue, near 14th Street; $; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The 1929 in the name refers to the era of French colonialism in Indochina, and a blue velvet is a French cocktail. Blue Velvet is in fact a  Vietnamese restaurant. Appetizers include fried spring rolls with chicken; steamed shrimp salad with pineapple, shallots, basil and mint; and grilled eggplant with lime juice, ginger and sesame seeds. Entrees include sliced fillet of beef with carrots and asparagus in a light peanut satay sauce; grilled whole prawns with crushed ginger, scallions and rice angel-hair noodles; and steamed fillet of sea bass with ginger and asparagus.

($25 and Under: 6/14/00)</p>
        <p>DAILY CHOW  +  (212) 254-7887; 2 East Second Street, at Bowery, $; smoking upstairs only after 6 p.m.; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Daily Chow, which brings together Thai and Korean dishes, does enough things well and is so good-natured that a meal there can be thoroughly enjoyable. Starters include Vietnamese ravioli; marinated grilled chicken on skewers with peanut sauce and cucumber salad; and green leaf lettuce topped with fried calamari served with sesame soy dressing.  Main dishes include Korean style beef with sesame, soy, ginger, carrots and scallions; sauteed Thai rice stick noodles with shrimp, egg, bean sprouts and scallions; and grilled sirloin steak with lemon grass, garlic and soy. ($25 and Under: 9/20/00)</p>
        <p>HABIB'S PLACE  ++  (212) 979-2243; 438 East Ninth Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A; $; no smoking; cash only.</p>
        <p>This tiny North African and Middle Eastern restaurant looks as if it has been transported directly from the Latin Quarter. The falafel and couscous dishes are terrific. The crisp, savory, deep-fried blend of ground chickpeas and spices is stuffed into a pita, along with lettuce, tomato, marinated peppers, cucumbers, olives and tahini dressing. Other sandwiches include tabbouleh, grape leaves, feta cheese. Platters include falafel, baba ghanouj or grape leaves, and hummus and tabbouleh, or just about any combination you can imagine. (Article: 6/16/ 99)</p>
        <p>HOLY BASIL  +  (212) 460-5557; 149 Second Avenue, near Ninth Street; $; smoking permitted; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>What sets Holy Basil apart from many Thai restaurants is the graceful balance of the cooking. Current appetizers include duck spring rolls with tomato chile sauce; steamed mussels with white wine and Thai herbs; and spare ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper. Main dishes include whole crispy fish in red chili sauce and basil leaves; crispy duck with minced garlic and ground black pepper in a brown sauce; and Talay Thai, which is sauteed seafood with lemon grass, holy basil leaves, galangal, kaffir lime leaf, ground chili pepper, and mushrooms in a white wine sauce. ($25 and Under: 3/7/97)</p>
        <p>LAVAGNA  +  (212) 979-1005; 545 East Fifth Street, at Avenue B; $; no smoking; American Express only.</p>
        <p>Lavagna serves fresh food from the Italian part of the Mediterranean, with honest, straightforward flavors. Appetizers include calamari stuffed with baby rock shrimp with tomato pepperoncini salsa; wood-oven-roasted artichoke with white bean and wild mushroom ragout; and mussels steamed in white wine and tomato. Main dishes include pepper crusted ahi tuna with wilted spinach, oven cured tomato, currant and pine nut compote; grilled rib steak seared with fresh herbs and served with potato gratin; and pan-roasted halibut saltimbocca with grilled eggplant and truffle sweet-pea coulis. ($25 and Under: 3/10/99)</p>
        <p>MAX  +  (212) 539-0111; 51 Avenue B, near Fourth Street; $; smoking section; cash only.</p>
        <p>This tiny Italian restaurant is packed nightly and the draw is exactly what has always attracted people to neighborhood restaurants: well-prepared food, served with warmth.  Appetizers include portobello mushrooms with reduction of balsamic vinegar; liver pate on toasted bread; toasted garlic bread, with or without anchovies; and mixed grilled vegetables. Entrees include pan-seared cod with mashed potatoes and salad; veal shank served over risotto; and grilled fillet of salmon with spinach and mashed potatoes. ($25 and Under: 5/3/00)</p>
