        <p>Nobody wins a Subway Series. Or maybe everybody does.</p>
        <p>''When it first seemed possible, my girlfriend asked if it was dangerous,'' said Archie Armstrong, my companion in the late 90's at Yankee Stadium retreats. ''She wondered if it was like pitching brother against brother. She's a screenwriter, so she was thinking Civil War.''</p>

        <p>Nobody wins a Subway Series. Or maybe everybody does.</p>
        <p>''When it first seemed possible, my girlfriend asked if it was dangerous,'' said Archie Armstrong, my companion in the late 90's at Yankee Stadium retreats. ''She wondered if it was like pitching brother against brother. She's a screenwriter, so she was thinking Civil War.''</p>
        <p>The idea of the Subway Series has been a fanciful moment as it unfolded, one of those ''soft'' events that New Yorkers can mold into idiosyncratic interpretation. For Peter Levine, who returned to Brooklyn last month after 31 years teaching history at Michigan State, it was a personal welcome from his native land. For Roger Sims, waiting out in Seattle for a new kidney and pancreatic islets, it was a chance to identify with his beloved Yankees as an underdog. For Barry Goldman it was another blow to be suffered; he has never truly rooted for any team besides the New York Giants.</p>
        <p>For the Rev. Vincent J. Termine, it was an opportunity to bind the wounds of the city.</p>
        <p>''It'll drive everybody crazy in a good way,'' said Father Termine, oldest of the five at 80. ''Because they want the Subway Series so badly, Mets fans will be rooting for the Yankees and Yankee fans will be rooting for the Mets. It would be wonderful, a dream come true.''</p>
        <p>Father Termine, who recently retired after 34 years as the Sanitation Department's Roman Catholic chaplain, was a parish priest in Brooklyn for almost 50 years. He had a box seat at Ebbets Field. He gave up baseball when the Dodgers abandoned New York.</p>
        <p>''And then the Mets came and they were so horrible, I had to root for them as underdogs, and I became a fan,'' he said. ''No, no, I don't pray for them to win; you don't do that. Then there could be a bishop praying on the other side.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong, youngest of the four at 32, grew up rooting for the Yankees who have grown up to him.</p>
        <p>''They're an old team, which means they're my age now,'' he said. ''It's considered cooler to be a Mets fan, except among Latinos who have no old white lefty hang-ups. The worst people are those privileged rich white guys who wear Red Sox or Cubs caps because they have romantic notions about losers.''</p>
        <p>This idea about the Yankees as the Harvard of baseball (they've been called the U.S. Steel or Chase Manhattan of baseball, which is less precise) should be what makes them attractive. It was for Levine and Sims.</p>
        <p>''My father, Sam, taught Sandy Koufax history at Lafayette High School,'' said Levine, who is 56. ''I went to a lot of games at Ebbets Field for 75 cents. That was balanced against my grandfather, who watched the Yankees because he loved the center fielder he called Mickey Mendell.</p>
        <p>''But what made me a Yankee fan was wanting to be associated with a winner. I wasn't a popular kid, I wasn't part of the in group. I didn't feel like a winner, no one told me I was a winner. But when I rooted for the Yankees I was a winner.''</p>
        <p>Sims was born in Chicago, disliked both the White Sox and Cubs. In 1947, when he was 9, his family told him he should root for the Dodgers because they had signed Jackie Robinson.</p>
        <p>''I was hardheaded; I wasn't going to root for a lousy team just because they had a black guy,'' said Sims, who is black. ''The Dodgers were supposed to be lovable losers, and I didn't see anything lovable about losing. I wanted to identify with a winner. And then I went downtown one Sunday after church and saw 'Pride of the Yankees'; it was marvelous, just so neat, and that was that.''</p>
        <p>Even after he moved to Brooklyn as a teenager, Sims remained a Yankee fan.</p>
        <p>He has stayed one through air combat in Vietnam, ground combat in network television and the rejection of his first transplanted kidney. He said he was gaining a grudging respect for the Mariners, but not for their fans.</p>
        <p>''This city really wants to beat New York as some sort of affirmation,'' he said. ''To this day they talk about beating the Yankees in the '95 playoffs, it was like a municipal orgasm. It doesn't matter that they lost after that; they just had another latte. I like the idea that the Yankees are underdogs now.</p>
        <p>''If they lose, I'll root for the Mets, as a New Yorker, but that may be because I'm 3,000 miles away from the braying of Mets fans. And I read all this dumping on Bobby Valentine by the New York writers; I think he's an underdog, too.''</p>
        <p>Goldman grew up in Rego Park, Queens, and taught me how to score a game off the radio, but the only games we could hear were Giants games. He seems to have remembered every Giants game he ever heard or saw. He can be particularly boring on Mel Ott's last hit. Last week, he rooted vainly for the Giants against the Mets. But Goldman, who is 62 and head of the family printing business, may have truly sent his heart to San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''I think I'm the modern fan,'' he said, idly watching the Mets against St. Louis. ''I root for members of my Rotisserie baseball team. There have been a couple of times one of them beat the Giants with a grand slam home run, and I was happy.''</p>
