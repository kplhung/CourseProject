        <p>MEDINE-William S. 95 years old, on Tuesday, October 10 in Arlington, VA. Bill, whose former residence was West Palm Beach, FL, died quietly in his sleep at home. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife Edith. He is deeply mourned by his daughters Amy Medine Stein &amp; Laurie Alexander. He was much loved by his son-in-law Arthur Alexander and his son-in-law Marvin Horovitz. He was honored in life by his late sonin-law Morry Stein. Bill's five grandsons, who adored him, are Eric, Tony and George Stein and Paul and Peter Saperstone. Grand daughters by marriage who benefited from his warmth are Mary Stein, Stacia Saperstone &amp; Nancy Saperstone. He was thrilled to have four great grandchildren Amanda, Zachary, Emily and Jack and dearly loved his niece &amp; nephew Bobbie and Phil Rubin and sister Anna Pero. Bill, with his wife Edith, was the founder of Camp Echo Lake, Warrensburg, NY. They served as directors from 1946 through 1963 wisely and lovingly guiding the many boys and girls who passed through their hands. From 1963 forward Bill and Edith mentored the second and third generation of family leadership, Amy and Morry Stein, then Tony, George and Mary Stein at the camp he loved so much. This past August he eloquently and proudly addressed the alumni who attended the festivities marking the 55th anniversary of the founding of Echo Lake. His vast family of friends feel privileged to have been touched by his elegance, wisdom and humor. His family is inspired by a patriarch whose devotion to his wife and family was without peer. His spirit, intellect and mind were vibrant until the very end. Shiva will be observed on Monday and Tuesday evenings at 49 Clubway, Hartsdale, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Morry's Camp, a summer camp and year-round program he so generously endowed. The address is 3 West Main Street, Elmsford, New York 10523.</p>
