        <p>FOR an idea of what the zydeco dance concerts held once a month at the South Presbyterian Church here are like, imagine ''Saturday Night Fever'' with an uptempo rhythm and a blues soundtrack made even spicier by a dousing of Louisiana hot sauce.</p>
        <p>Since it began seven years ago, the zydeco dances, energized by a genuine, down-home zydeco band from Louisiana, has attracted dancers of all ages and ilk.</p>
        <p>The dance concerts begin in earnest at 8:30 p.m., but starting at 7:30 there is a dance workshop for beginners led by Laura Selikson, who originated and continues to produce the high-spirited events. ''I certainly don't do this for the money,'' she said. ''It's a lot of fun, and I love to dance. Plus, the music's great.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Selikson, a doctor's assistant and former Westchester resident now living in Manhattan, was first bitten by the Louisiana music bug in 1985 when she attended a performance by the Cajun band Beausoleil at a church in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I'd never heard such an infectious and wonderful kind of music before,'' Ms. Selikson recalled, ''and I was sitting there, really enjoying the music, when an old lady next to me said, 'Get up, dearie -- somebody will dance with you,' and sure enough, someone did.''</p>
        <p>Her dance partner turned out to be a college professor from New Orleans who was teaching in New York. Ms. Selikson became friends with him and his wife, and before long she was tagging along to catch the bands from Louisiana that played at Tamps, a nightclub that has since closed in Midtown Manhattan. She even joined them on trips to summer music festivals and on a musical pilgrimage to New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Selikson, who was living in Mamaroneck at the time, realized that many of the people at the zydeco concerts around New York City were from Westchester. So, in late 1992, she held a meeting with several neighbors to organize their own dance concerts closer to home. ''But we didn't know anything about putting on a concert,'' she said  with a laugh. ''All we knew how to do was dance. Prior to our first show a nine-page-long contract for the band came in the mail, and I was mortified.''</p>
        <p>That first zydeco dance in Westchester, held in February 1993 at the V.F.W. hall in Larchmont, featured Nathan and the Zydeco Cha-Chas, and the band showed up late after being robbed at a rest stop near Washington, Ms. Selikson said. Still, 204 dancers and curious music fans paid $12.50 to get in.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the evening's success, Ms.  Selikson begin putting on nine dances a year, skipping the summer months, with a partner, Myrna Wolfe, from Queens, under the name Cajun Connections. Since November 1998, she has been o her own, with a  production company she calls Zydeco Express.</p>
        <p>After hopping around Westchester over the years, Ms. Selikson is hoping to have a permanent home for the concerts at the South Presbyterian Church parish hall.</p>
        <p>Leroy Thomas and the Zydeco Road Runners, originally from Louisiana but now based in Houston, were the opening act for this season's series last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas said the word ''zydeco,'' a slang term in French-Creole for snap beans, was first appropriated for the music by  Clifton Chenier, the late King of Zydeco.</p>
        <p>The music started promptly at 8:30 p.m., with Mr. Thomas squeezing and pumping his box accordion high over his head while the electric bass guitar rumbled and the snare drum popped in rhythm. The dance floor was immediately packed.</p>
        <p>''Dancing is great,'' said Pat Haskel of White Plains as she tapped her fancy cowboy boots to the music. ''It fulfills basic human needs like socialization, and there's touching, too.''</p>
        <p>Richard Knapich, a 50-year-old homicide detective in the New Rochelle Police Department, who is set to retire to Louisiana later this month, said, ''Zydeco is such a happy music and it is so full of energy that you can't listen to it and sit still.''</p>
        <p>Just before heading out to the dance floor, Susan Eisman, a 52-year-old resident of Park Slope, Brooklyn, said that the zydeco dances are a ''nonthreatening way'' to connect with new people. ''We've become a big family here at these dances,'' she said. ''For  some reason the nicest group of people come out to hear zydeco.''</p>
        <p>The manner in which people dance to zydeco is similar to the Texas two-step, with some sock hop twirls and polka slides added.</p>
        <p>Because more women than men show up at the dances, few men are given a chance to sit out, and women will often dance with each other. Linda Gunsberg, a clinical psychologist from Manhattan who was at the dance with her teen-age daughter, said  there was a systematic, yet not wholly  strict, rule about changing partners after a few songs. ''It definitely takes a while before you start feeling comfortable asking people you don't know to dance with you,'' she said, observing that skilled dancers will often avoid the newcomers.</p>
        <p>The band took a break a few minutes after 10, and Mr. Knapich, dripping in sweat, hurried out to change his shirt.</p>
        <p>''Experienced types know to bring an extra set of clothes,'' he said, holding up his valise. A half-hour later he was back on the dance floor where the crowd of dancers was still rocking and reeling.</p>
        <p>Andre Thierry &amp; Zydeco Magic will appear at the next zydeco dance concert next Saturday at the South Presbyterian Church, 343 Broadway, Dobbs Ferry. Admission: $15. The music officially starts at 8:30 p.m.; a dance workshop for beginners starts at 7:30. Information: (212) 685-7597.</p>
