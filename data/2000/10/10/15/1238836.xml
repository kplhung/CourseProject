        <p>Traveling to Cuba has become politically acceptable enough that two cultural institutions, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the American Museum of Natural History in New York, are sponsoring trips there in January.</p>
        <p>The Boston trip is a continuing-education class in the art school, Making Art in Cuba, from Jan. 5 to 12, led by Marcos Carvajal, a faculty member who is Cuban and a graduate of the University of Havana. Students can meet local artists and work in any medium. It will include time in Old Havana, the towns of Regla and Santa Maria del Mar, and the Vinales Valley.</p>

        <p>Traveling to Cuba has become politically acceptable enough that two cultural institutions, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the American Museum of Natural History in New York, are sponsoring trips there in January.</p>
        <p>The Boston trip is a continuing-education class in the art school, Making Art in Cuba, from Jan. 5 to 12, led by Marcos Carvajal, a faculty member who is Cuban and a graduate of the University of Havana. Students can meet local artists and work in any medium. It will include time in Old Havana, the towns of Regla and Santa Maria del Mar, and the Vinales Valley.</p>
        <p>The cost is $2,500 a person, double occupancy, and includes air fare from New York on Cubana Airlines, lodging in hotels in renovated colonial buildings, ground transport and most meals (the Treasury Department license for the trip allows participants to spend up to $150 a day on the island). The registration deadline is Nov. 6. Information: (617) 267-1219 or www.smfa.com.</p>
        <p>The Natural History Museum's tour, Cuba: Image and Reality, Jan. 18 to 28, features a cruise around much of the island, and focuses on architecture, culture and natural history. It sold out quickly and a second departure was added, on March 5, which also sold out. But United States Government approval was still pending early last week, according to Elizabeth DeGaetano, the program development coordinator.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for two days in Havana before boarding the 44-passenger Panorama, a sail and motor yacht. Among the destinations are Bahia de Corrientes on the sparsely populated western coast, the Bay of Pigs, San Juan Hill and Guantanamo Bay.  The cost, $5,595 to $6,495 each, double, includes lectures, excursions, hotels and all meals. A charter flight from Miami to Havana is $390 extra. Information: (800) 462-8687, fax (212) 769-5755.</p>
