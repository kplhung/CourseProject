        <p>Building on a campaign theme that has played well with many voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced a new health care proposal aimed at providing financial assistance to families who care for elderly relatives and those with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who has made health care issues a cornerstone of her Senate candidacy, said the new plan was directed at middle-class people and families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to comfortably take on the burden of caring for themselves or an ailing or aging family member.</p>

        <p>Building on a campaign theme that has played well with many voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced a new health care proposal aimed at providing financial assistance to families who care for elderly relatives and those with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who has made health care issues a cornerstone of her Senate candidacy, said the new plan was directed at middle-class people and families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to comfortably take on the burden of caring for themselves or an ailing or aging family member.</p>
        <p>''Long-term care can wipe that nest egg away much faster than it took to save it, and that is not right,'' Mrs. Clinton told 120 residents of the Hudson Ridge Towers, a low-income housing project here. ''We have an extraordinary amount of prosperity. We need to be thinking ahead.''</p>
        <p>Under the plan, families or individuals with a maximum annual income of $50,000 and assets of $200,000 would qualify for up to $4,000 in state and federal assistance each year.</p>
        <p>The money could be used to pay for in-home nursing care, long-term insurance, rehabilitation or any of a variety of other expenses associated with providing long-term care. Families would be required to match up to 25 percent of the government payments with their own money to qualify for the assistance.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton estimated that the proposal would cost $45 billion over 10 years and would apply to three million families nationwide, including 280,000 in New York. She said the money would come from the expected federal budget surplus, but would not require taking funds away from her other proposals for the surplus, such as shoring up Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>Combined with a $3,000 tax credit for long-term care already being considered by Congress, today's proposal is intended to make it easier for families to make ends meet after deciding not to place relatives in nursing homes or other permanent care arrangements, Mrs. Clinton said. She said she also supported the tax credit, but had come to recognize that it would not be enough for many families in New York.</p>
        <p>''That didn't fit the needs I kept hearing about as I met with people around the state who told me just painful, excruciating stories about the challenges they and their families were meeting,'' she said of the tax credit. ''This is a way of responding to the needs I have heard about.''</p>
        <p>One of the residents of Hudson Ridge Towers who introduced Mrs. Clinton, Ceal Barillaro, 73, fought back tears as she described the guilt many elderly people felt as they became increasingly dependent on government assistance because of illness and insufficient incomes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Barillaro said she had mostly avoided thinking about how she would care for herself in old age, but had been forced to confront the problem because she was losing her sight.</p>
        <p>''We have to make them know that we are not trying to rob them, we are not trying to take everything away from their families,'' Mrs. Barillaro said of taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Patrecia Ross, 63, another Hudson Ridge resident, said Mrs. Clinton's focus on health care issues that elderly people worry a lot about had made her popular among senior citizens.</p>
        <p>''I just hope that once she gets in the Senate that she is able to follow through,'' said Mrs. Ross, a former stock clerk in a drugstore who lives on disability insurance.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's announcement here came as Representative Rick A. Lazio, her Republican opponent, released two new statewide television advertisements that question her commitment to New York.</p>
        <p>Asked about the ads, Mrs. Clinton declined to respond with specifics, saying only that she wanted to keep talking about issues likes her health care initiatives that she hopes will define her tenure in the Senate.</p>
        <p>''I am going to keep doing what I've been doing,'' she said.</p>
        <p>During a brief news conference outside the housing project, Mrs. Clinton spoke about the violence in the Middle East and the preparations President Clinton had made for Monday's emergency summit meeting.</p>
        <p>''He has spent countless hours on the telephone in consultation,'' she said. ''He has worked around the clock to bring about this meeting.''</p>
        <p>She also let it be known that if the Yankees and the Mets reach the World Series, her loyalties will not be divided.</p>
        <p>''I have been a Yankees fan since I was a little girl,'' she said. ''When I was a little girl, there weren't any Mets.''</p>
