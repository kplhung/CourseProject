        <p>To the Editor: After ''Sometimes, Smaller is Better'' (Aug. 20) by John Rosenthal, and ''larger is better when it's raining'' (the letter from Seymour Goldberg, Sept. 3), I feel a little like Goldilocks. As far as cruise ships go, small may suit some and large others, but for me our midsize ship was just right for Alaska.</p>
        <p>My husband and I took a two-week Elderhostel tour of the Inside Passage in August. There were 130 hostelers among the 700 passengers on our ship, the Universe Explorer, which has eight decks, five lounges, a 200-seat theater, a computer center and a very small exercise room.</p>

        <p>The ship was small enough to get so close to a glacier that we could hear the crack as it calved. It was big enough to be comfortable and stable and to have entertainment by fine classical instrumentalists and singers, plus a dance band in the evening.</p>
        <p>The University of Alaska at Fairbanks provided us with experienced leaderswho took us close to Alaska's wildlife, its natural beauty and, perhaps most important to me, a better understanding of the people who lived there first and those who came later.</p>
