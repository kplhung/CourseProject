        <p>THE AUSTERE ACADEMY</p>
        <p>By Lemony Snicket.</p>
        <p>Illustrated by Brett Helquist.</p>
        <p>221 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers.</p>
        <p>$8.95. (Ages 8 and up)</p>
        <p>Had the gloom-haunted Edward Gorey found a way to have a love child with Dorothy Parker, their issue might well have been Lemony Snicket, the pseudonymous author of a multivolume family chronicle brought out under the genteel appellation ''A Series of Unfortunate Events.''</p>
        <p>The scribe of the Baudelaire family misfortunes speaks morosely to his readers, promising that however cheery things may appear, in the end nothing will go well. Rewardingly, so far in five volumes, nothing has.</p>
        <p>Orphaned with authorial dispatch by Page 8 of the first book, the three Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, are sent to live with a different inept guardian in each subsequent volume. Troubles hound the pitiful family. Uncle Monty is poisoned. Aunt Josephine is thrown overboard to be devoured by leeches. All the while, villainous Count Olaf pursues the children in order to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune. He is always foiled, but lives to try again. By the end of each novel the children are being nudged toward another new and even more fretworthy situation.</p>
        <p>The effect is not sadistic, because all is not as grim as advertised. Though the three orphans sport only the slimmest of personalities, they do manage to sidestep fatal calamities. Violet, the oldest, is an inventor. Klaus loves to do research. There is decent feeling between them. ''Klaus had known for all 12 of his years that his older sister found a hand on her shoulder comforting -- as long as the hand was attached to an arm, of course.'' The youngest child, Sunny, can only say one nonsense word at a time. ''If Sunny had not been feeling so shy, she might have opened her mouth, revealing her four sharp teeth, and said, 'Marimo!' which may have meant 'I hope there are plenty of things to bite at school, because biting things is one of my favorite things to do!' ''</p>
        <p>The children are not ghouls, but irrepressible, brave and charming. And, in the finest tradition of children's books, the Baudelaire orphans suffer from chronic bibliophilia. Each book features a library of one sort or another, and the literary jokes are a dime a dollop. (In ''The Reptile Room,'' Uncle Monty instructs the children about the care and handling of toads, newts and pythons, and exhorts them ''to never, under any circumstances, let the Virginian Wolfsnake near a typewriter.'')</p>
        <p>Formulaic? Self-consciously, generously, joyously so. The fun derives from watching the formula at work. The author is Daniel Handler, whose work for adults has been reviewed in these pages recently. He has taken a small handful of storytelling tricks -- one might even call them tics -- and he has made them convulse in convincing sequence, so that despite the contrivances there is something vivid and even urgent about these tales.</p>
        <p>Handler's alter ego, Lemony Snicket, repeatedly interrupts the story to define words. ''Uncle Monty would often segue -- a word which here means 'let the conversation veer off.' ''Lemony Snicket digresses too, into ruminative asides about morality, mortality and fate. ''Stealing, of course, is a crime, and a very impolite thing to do. But like most impolite things, it is excusable under certain circumstances. Stealing is not excusable if, for instance, you are in a museum and you decide that a certain painting would look better in your house, and you simply grab the painting and take it there. But if you were very, very hungry, and if you had no way of obtaining money, it might be excusable to grab the painting, take it to your house, and eat it.''</p>
        <p>The books are for knowing readers, because the author is better at verbal humor than slapstick. We find sly narrative tricks: ''The book was long, and difficult to read, and Klaus became more and more tired as the night wore on. Occasionally his eyes would close. He found himself reading the same sentence over and over. He found himself reading the same sentence over and over. He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.'' We find the most lovely, acidic asides: ''On a cold day, in a drafty room, chilled cucumber soup is about as welcome as a swarm of wasps at a bat mitzvah.''</p>
        <p>But even the nonsensical details amuse. In ''The Austere Academy'' (the Prufrock Preparatory School motto is ''Memento Mori''), the Baudelaire children are billeted not in the dormitory but in a fungus-ridden tin shack, fitted out with ugly wallpaper, bales of hay for beds, and a population of small crabs who turn out to be ''territorial, a word which here means 'unhappy to see small children in their living quarters.' ''</p>
        <p>Inevitably, the books aren't uniformly good, but they're brief and easily digestible, and if ''The Miserable Mill'' isn't as fine or funny as ''The Wide Window,'' just wait another publishing season. ''I wish now that I had the power to go back in time and speak to these three sobbing children. If I could, I could tell the Baudelaires that like earthquakes and puppet shows, their tears were occurring not only without warning but without good reason.'' Our tears occur from laughter, not fright or pathos.</p>
        <p>Some brilliant publishing person or cabal saw the pleasure in these tales -- anarchy masked as propriety -- and decided, brilliantly, to engage Brett Helquist to do the spiky and droll line drawings. The illustrations and the writing parody juvenile literature of an earlier time; so do the production values. The pages are rough-cut and the endpapers evoke steel engraving, while the trompe-l'oeil covers suggest color plates inset in a buckram binding. Evocative of gift books of an earlier day, the presentation is inspired, a word which here means ''designed to alight on best-seller lists, which can hardly qualify as a seriously unfortunate event.''</p>
        <p>Despite their travails, the Baudelaire orphans are plucky, and may just buck the authorial prophecies and survive or even, eventually, triumph. But I, for one, can only hope it will take them a long, long, long time.</p>
