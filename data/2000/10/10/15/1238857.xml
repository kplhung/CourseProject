        <p>Even if you can't afford a 200-year-old lead cherub, there's no reason why you can't fill your garden with antiques. Try heirloom bulbs such as the little Guinea Hen Flower or Checkered Lily (Fritillaria meleagris). The Checkered Lily is a small plant with pendant, tulip-like blossoms that seem to be marked with a checkerboard pattern. It has been documented since at least 1572.  Plant them amid clumps of the white daffodil Avalanche, which is also sometimes known as Seventeen Sisters (from 1700 or before). Find old cultivars at Brent and Becky's Bulbs, 4763 Heath Trail, Gloucester, Va. 23061, (804) 693-3966 or online at brentandbeckysbulbs.com; or at Old House Gardens (send $2.00 for catalog), 536 W. Third Street, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48103, (734) 995-1486 or online at old housegardens.com.</p>
