        <p>THE SETTING -- Ralph Nader may not be included in the presidential debates, but on Tuesday night, inside the cozy auditorium of Public School 321, Park Slope's purple-turtleneck and grizzled-beard set made a place for him. Below walls hung with hand-painted quilts, 200 residents filed in for a local version of the Nader-Gore debate that never was.</p>
        <p>''My husband and I were arguing,'' said Ellen Raider, 60, who works in conflict resolution at Columbia University and who spent last week posting 6,000 fliers around the neighborhood. ''I'm a Green and he's a Democrat, and so we decided to get the community together to debate this.''</p>

        <p>THE SETTING -- Ralph Nader may not be included in the presidential debates, but on Tuesday night, inside the cozy auditorium of Public School 321, Park Slope's purple-turtleneck and grizzled-beard set made a place for him. Below walls hung with hand-painted quilts, 200 residents filed in for a local version of the Nader-Gore debate that never was.</p>
        <p>''My husband and I were arguing,'' said Ellen Raider, 60, who works in conflict resolution at Columbia University and who spent last week posting 6,000 fliers around the neighborhood. ''I'm a Green and he's a Democrat, and so we decided to get the community together to debate this.''</p>
        <p>Drinking lattes and knitting earth-tone sweaters, the audience listened to former State Senator Catherine Abate, a guest of the Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats, say a vote for Mr. Nader meant a vote for Gov. George W. Bush. Ronnie Dugger, founding editor of The Texas Observer and a former New York Green Party senate candidate, and a guest of the Park Slope Greens and the South Slope Greens, said Vice President Al Gore already had a sure victory in New York, and that a vote for Gore was a vote for corporate oligarchy.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- ''It's mostly a Green crowd here, but we are not enemies,'' Ms. Raider murmured as the audience applauded as Mr. Dugger stated Mr. Nader's support for legalizing marijuana and ending capital punishment. Most Park Slope residents are Democrats or Greens, Ms. Raider said. Later this month, another debate will include a Bush backer.</p>
        <p>After the speeches, audience members approached the microphone.</p>
        <p>''I stand by everything Mr. Nader stands for,'' one woman said. ''But I'm voting for Al Gore because I don't want Bush to get in.''</p>
        <p>The crowd hissed.</p>
        <p>A man with a Nader button, a string tie and a German accent got up and spoke about Mr. Nader's opposition to genetically altered food.</p>
        <p>''When you buy McDonalds in Europe,'' he said, ''it's not genetically altered. It's junk food, but it's not genetically altered.''</p>
        <p>A 13-year-old boy got up. ''I would vote for Nader,'' he said. ''There are people out there who want to vote for what they believe in, not vote for something they believe in less than something else.''</p>
        <p>The crowd roared, and he rejoined his father, who said he was still undecided.</p>
        <p>Afterward, amid tables laden with leaflets, one man hawked tickets to Mr. Nader's Madison Square Garden appearance while another recruited participants for an anti-Bush performance art piece involving trash cans and salad tongs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Raider declared the night a success. Had her husband changed his mind?</p>
        <p>''Hell, no,'' he growled.</p>
        <p>''We're going to argue all the way home,'' she said.</p>
