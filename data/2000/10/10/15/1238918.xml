        <p>Last Tuesday, a federal grand jury broke more than a year of investigative silence when it indicted four people for ''corrupting the Connecticut pension investment process,'' as the 46-page indictment bluntly put it, with millions of dollars in bribes.</p>
        <p>In simple but carefully constructed sentences, the indictment described how Paul J. Silvester, the former Republican state treasurer, who pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges last year, had overseen an illicit system of bogus consulting fees and campaign contributions that investigators said were either given or received by the four charged this week: Lisa A. Thiesfield, who was Mr. Silvester's former campaign manager; Ben F. Andrews Jr., Gov. John G. Rowland's former adviser and the Republican candidate for secretary of state in 1998, and two Boston investment-fund executives.</p>
        <p>They were charged with 25 felony crimes, including bribery, racketeering, money laundering, mail fraud, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. The two Boston executives, Frederick W. McCarthy and Charles B. Spadoni, along with ''others, known and unknown to the Grand Jury'' had agreed to pay Ms. Thiesfield and another Silvester associate, Christopher A. Stack, about $2 million in illegal fees over the past two years, according to federal prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Some of the money -- at least $276,000 -- was siphoned back to Mr. Silvester, the indictment says, who held his office from July 1997 to Jan. 6, 1999; $25,000 was given to Ms. Thiesfield as cover for work on Mr. Silvester's unsuccessful re-election campaign; the Boston executives and their company, Triumph Capital Group,, and ''others, known and unknown to the Grand Jury,'' also agreed to raise $100,000 for Connecticut's Republican Party, whose chairman, according to the indictment, understood from discussions with Mr. Silvester that the money would ultimately be passed on to Mr. Silvester's re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>What's more, in exchange for giving another investment firm, which the indictment referred only as Fund A, a pension-fund contract, Mr. Silvester, Mr. Andrews and ''others, known and unknown to the Grand Jury'' conspired with Mr. Stack and Ms. Silvester to solicit from Fund A $1 million for Mr. Andrews.</p>
        <p>Notice a grammatical pattern? If this phrase, ''others, known and unknown to the Grand Jury,'' is menacingly vague, it is nonetheless a clue, one of several sewn into the government's 46-page indictment, which support the belief of most people inside and outside of state government that the Silvester scandal has yet to ensnare its last victim.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most provocative of these clues appeared on page 35 of the indictment, in a passage that says Mr. Silvester ''reached an arrangement with the chairman of the C.R.P.'' -- the Connecticut Republican Party -- under which Mr. Silvester ''expected that the C.R.P. would give to the 'Silvester for State Treasurer' campaign a percentage of the monies contributed to the C.R.P.'' by Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Spadoni, through disguised payments made through their relatives. The contribution was for $100,000.</p>
        <p>Though almost intentionally ambiguous, the passage implies that Connecticut's Republican Party chairman, Chris DePino, whose name does not appear in the indictment and who has not been charged, was involved in the arrangement, which appears to violate the state's campaign finance laws. Under state law, corporations cannot directly contribute money to candidates for political office and are limited to giving $5,000 to a political party over a calendar year. Individuals can contribute a maximum of $1,500 per election cycle to candidates seeking statewide office.</p>
        <p>Asked whether the indictment's description of the arrangement between the Republican Party chairman and Mr. Silvester was illegal, Jeffrey Garfield, executive director of the state Elections Enforcement Commission, said: ''If the purpose for earmarking a contribution would be to circumvent an existing restriction or limitation, then the law restricting that transaction would apply.'' He declined to be more specific.</p>
        <p>Alan S. Plofsky, the executive director of the State Ethics Commission, which oversees laws barring inappropriate financial agreements by elected officials, declined to comment on the passage. The United States Attorney's office also declined to answer specific questions about the meaning of the passage and whether it implicated Mr. DePino.</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. DePino had broken any laws, Delcie Thibault, a spokeswoman, read a statement by the United States Attorney's chief lawyer, John H. Durham. ''Mr. DePino is not charged in the indictment,'' the statement said. ''There is no allegation that he violated any federal law.''</p>
        <p>Once again, the public is forced to consider what the definition of ''is'' is. While prosecutors declined to say whether he is being investigated -- prosecutors rarely comment on ongoing probes -- earlier this year, federal officials subpoenaed documents from the Republican Party's treasury records.</p>
        <p>Mr. DePino has consistently declined to comment on his relationship with Mr. Silvester. On Wednesday, barraged by calls from reporters to his office and home in New Haven, he issued a printed statement. ''We will continue to cooperate fully with any government investigation,'' the statement said. ''From that investigation there are no allegations of illegality by me or the Connecticut Republican Party. Because all of the parties involved, including the government, have a right to a fair trial, it is inappropriate for me to make any further comment.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Governor Rowland said Mr. DePino had done nothing wrong, and in an article in the New Haven Register, Mr. DePino said he had ''not done anything illegal.''</p>
        <p>There are other clues that the government will produce indictments in the future. For instance, Fund A, which the indictment says is a Connecticut-based company, is clearly implicated in the bribery scheme involving Mr. Andrews. There are also letters sent from a ''N.Y. law firm'' to the chairman of Fund A on behalf of Mr. Andrews, who stood to earn $1 million from the fund after Mr. Silvester increased the fund's total investment by $50 million in 1999. The letters ask the chairman to pay Mr. Andrews his fee.</p>
        <p>The indictment also lists similar letters sent from a law firm in Massachusetts and another in Connecticut to people involved in Mr. Silvester's schemes. Whether the firms could be held legally responsible for any wrongdoing is not clear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrews, moreover, is also charged with witness tampering for his efforts to influence what two people, known in the indictment as Witness A and Witness B, told the F.B.I. during its investigation of Mr. Andrews's business dealings. Federal investigators have refused to publicly identify either witness or say whether they violated any laws.</p>
        <p>And so, for now, whether any further indictments come out of the political, financial and legal mess that Paul Silvester created three years ago will remain mostly a matter of speculation by the public, the reporters and, of course, ''others, known and unknown to the Grand Jury.''</p>
