        <p>Plans to build a 100,000-seat stock car racetrack at the Meadowlands Sports Complex have all but died following the state's refusal to  subsidize the $400 million project with taxpayer money and low-interest loans. The Whitman administration, which has been negotiating with professional racing over the past year to bring a Nascar speedway to New  Jersey, bowed out of the project recently, saying that Nascar's request for a $200 million subsidy was too high. Although the Meadowlands racetrack project appears highly unlikely, the industry has not given up its plans to secure a presence in the area. Stock car racing is hugely popular in other parts of the country, and Nascar has had its eye on the New York metropolitan region for some time. The Meadowlands currently houses the Jets, Giants, Nets, Devils and MetroStars, and all except for the Giants have talked of relocating.</p>
