        <p>AGATHA CHRISTIE he is not, but Ron Hazelton unravels the mysteries hidden deep inside your car in ''The Body Shop,'' a two-hour program that kicks off the History Channel's ''Modern Marvels: Men at Work Week,'' at 9 p.m. Eastern time Monday.</p>
        <p>If you can't tell your camshaft from your crankshaft and have ever wondered what horsepower really means, Mr. Hazelton, the handyman expert from ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' offers explanations as he and two certified mechanics methodically take apart a new Ford Taurus in front of the cameras.</p>
        <p>Viewers will learn not only that the Taurus has 14,000 parts, and what some of them look like, but also a little history of the major systems found in today's cars, including the engine, tires, brakes, suspension, transmission, steering, starter, air bags and electrical components.</p>
        <p>The host also looks at how vehicles are likely to change in the next few years, giving a primer on the workings of hybrid gas-electric powertrains, fuel cells, integrated navigation aids and devices that will bring the Internet, including e-mail, into the passenger cabin.</p>
        <p>In some cases, there are even lessons to be learned from parts of the Taurus that are left in place. Mr. Hazelton takes a sledgehammer to the car's windshield, for instance, to demonstrate that although it can be broken, the safety glass does not shatter into pieces.</p>
