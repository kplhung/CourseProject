        <p>The First Half-Million Is the Hardest  In the summer of 1999, David Johnson -- an Indianapolis attorney active in Indiana's Democratic Party -- decided to challenge Senator Richard Lugar, a four-term senator and onetime Republican presidential nominee. He immediately retained the services of Fred Yang, a pollster, and Frank Greer, a media consultant, who offered this advice: raise money. It makes you look like a serious candidate, he explained, thereby allowing you to raise still more money. Johnson, a political insider, knew whom to call. He took a leave of absence from his law firm and hit the phones; by the end of the year, he had amassed close to $500,000.</p>
        <p>Hire a Penny Pincher  In February, Johnson hired a campaign manager: Tim Shock, a Democratic political consultant with a reputation for upsets. Because he'd have to commute from Kentucky, his salary was relatively high -- about $10,000 a month. But he kept a close eye on incidental spending. ''Nobody can authorize an expense, any expense, except me,'' Shock said. He guided Johnson to hire a press secretary and two field managers, who joined a finance manager and three fund-raisers already on staff. Total monthly salaries: about $20,000. He ordered ''Johnson for Senate'' signs and bumper stickers that were low gloss, chose adhesive lapel stickers (25,000 for $400) rather than pins (as much as 70 cents apiece) and had Johnson driven around, rather than flown, even on 10-hour round trips. Meanwhile Johnson kept raising money, and by late June he was up to $1.3 million, far more than Lugar's previous opponent raised but less than half of what Lugar had.</p>

        <p>The First Half-Million Is the Hardest  In the summer of 1999, David Johnson -- an Indianapolis attorney active in Indiana's Democratic Party -- decided to challenge Senator Richard Lugar, a four-term senator and onetime Republican presidential nominee. He immediately retained the services of Fred Yang, a pollster, and Frank Greer, a media consultant, who offered this advice: raise money.

He took a leave of absence from his law firm and hit the phones; by the end of the year, he had amassed close to $500,000.</p>
        <p>Hire a Penny Pincher  In February, Johnson hired a campaign manager: Tim Shock, a Democratic political consultant with a reputation for upsets. Because he'd have to commute from Kentucky, his salary was relatively high -- about $10,000 a month. But he kept a close eye on incidental spending. ''Nobody can authorize an expense, any expense, except me,'' Shock said. He guided Johnson to hire a press secretary and two field managers, who joined a finance manager and three fund-raisers already on staff. Total monthly salaries: about $20,000. He ordered ''Johnson for Senate'' signs and bumper stickers that were low gloss, chose adhesive lapel stickers (25,000 for $400) rather than pins (as much as 70 cents apiece) and had Johnson driven around, rather than flown, even on 10-hour round trips. Meanwhile Johnson kept raising money, and by late June he was up to $1.3 million, far more than Lugar's previous opponent raised but less than half of what Lugar had.</p>
        <p>Make the First Ads Free  In April, The Indianapolis Star gave Lugar a 45-point lead over Johnson. Shock initiated ''work days,'' on which Johnson performed blue-collar jobs around the state in order to meet voters and generate footage for the nightly news. On a typical trip, Johnson and his press secretary traveled an hour and a half to Lafayette (population: 115,624) to give a civics lesson at an after-school class for ''at risk'' children. Total cost: just over $20, including gasoline ($6.40), sandwiches to eat in the car ($5) and M&amp;M's for the kids ($9.63). It paid off with full media coverage, including a front-page story with photos, in The Lafayette Journal &amp; Courier and a segment on Lafayette's TV station, WLFI.</p>
        <p>Get Lucky  Then, in July, Lugar's son was arrested for possessing marijuana. The possible upside was not lost on the Johnson campaign. Pinned to the wall of Shock's cubicle are newspaper clippings of the event, along with what looks like a fake joint and a note that reads ''Vote for Dick Lugar.'' But Shock insisted that any attempt to make an issue of it would backfire. ''That all stays in here,'' he said. ''Both sides here are playing clean.''</p>
        <p>Make Your Pitch  In August, at the Democratic National Convention, Johnson learned that the party would spend $250,000 on a TV ''issue ad'' that would ''raise questions about Lugar's record,'' Johnson said, adding, ''this is the big time.'' As party spending goes, it's not much, but it would set off a key series of events. First, the campaign would commission a poll by Yang (from $15,000 to $30,000) to show where voters stood after the ad ran. The campaign would then follow up with a pro-Johnson ad by Greer (between $10,000 to $12,000) -- one that's purely positive, with no mention of Lugar at all,'' Shock said -- and buy air time (an additional $250,000). The week after the convention, Johnson's campaign had vetted the ad, and air time had been purchased on eight TV stations.</p>
        <p>The Loneliest Number  But then two weeks after the ad was shown, the terrain shifted dramatically. Lugar, along with former Senator Sam Nunn, was nominated to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. ''There's nothing you can do about that,'' Shock says. Now Johnson is on his own. The Democratic Party has not promised to spend any more money on the race, and the campaign is dipping into its cash reserves. In mid-September (after an Indiana University poll showed Lugar leading Johnson by 43 points), his campaign launched its first ad, for roughly $400,000. In August, Shock had said that if the campaign didn't get a major ad blitz going by the end of that month, the campaign would be facing ''major problems.'' Now he says, ''We're doing what we can.''</p>
