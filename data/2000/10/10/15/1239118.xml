        <p>Vice President Al Gore has accused Gov. George W. Bush of ignoring the plight of the uninsured in Texas, which ranks near the bottom in health coverage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has attacked Mr. Gore as just another liberal who wants a ''government-run health care system.''</p>
        <p>The issue of the uninsured has flared anew in the presidential campaign, with a fierce exchange in the last debate and a new round of charges and countercharges about the Bush record in Texas. But many health policy experts say that at least so far, the 42.6 million Americans without health insurance have drawn far less attention in this campaign than the experts would have  hoped, given the budget surplus and the booming economy.</p>
        <p>Both candidates have offered proposals to expand coverage, but neither plan is on the scale proposed by their counterparts in 1992, Bill Clinton and President Bush. Governor Bush's proposal to use tax credits to help people buy private insurance ''is simply dwarfed by his father's plan,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, an expert on health policy at Princeton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would expand the existing Children's Health Insurance Program to ensure that all children have access to affordable coverage by 2005, a popular goal that gets high marks from health advocacy groups. But it also falls well short of the goal of health care for all, or universal coverage, that his party insisted on in 1992.</p>
        <p>The contrast is particularly striking, some health experts said, because the more ambitious proposals of 1992 and early 1993 came at a time when the annual budget deficits were at their peak, running at nearly $300 billion.</p>
        <p>For all of that, the step-by-step approach to expanding health coverage has many defenders, who note that it has the great advantage of being politically realistic. ''I personally do not believe we're going to get universal coverage in one piece of legislation,'' said Ron Pollack, head of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that is among the strongest advocates of universal coverage.</p>
        <p>''As a nation, we don't do very well at redistributing income,'' Mr. Pollack said, ''and if you're going to try to do universal coverage, you're going to gore the ox of one of the big interests -- and they're going to spend a fortune in opposition.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the political collapse of President Clinton's attempt at universal health insurance in 1993-94 still has an impact, pushing politicians to seek smaller, incremental solutions. Republicans, who conducted a fiercely ideological campaign against the Clinton plan are resurrecting it this year in campaigning against much more modest initiatives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, for example, recently asserted that Mr. Gore ''likes Hillary-Care,'' adding, ''He wants to nationalize the health care system of America.'' (Not exactly. Contrary to Republican dogma, the exceedingly complicated Clinton plan would not have nationalized the health care system; it would have required employers to provide insurance and created regulatory structures to oversee benefits and premiums.)</p>
        <p>Senator Bill Bradley's failed effort to build his Democratic presidential campaign around the cause of universal coverage also probably had a chilling effect, several analysts said.  Throughout the fall and winter last year, Mr. Gore picked apart the Bradley plan as unwieldy and unworkable.</p>
        <p>''The high point of talking about the uninsured was the Gore-Bradley debate,'' said Stuart Butler, a health expert at the Heritage Foundation, a research group. But it was not, in the end, a pretty moment.</p>
        <p>Finally, the uninsured have been eclipsed this year by a more popular health care issue with a more powerful constituency -- the lack of prescription drug coverage for the elderly. ''The elderly are a powerful vote,'' said Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health care at Harvard. ''And not only do seniors vote more, but their ability to organize, to hold forums, has garnered their cause a great deal more attention than the uninsured.''</p>
        <p>Several analysts also noted that as complicated as the prescription drug issue can be, it seems easier -- and cheaper -- to solve than covering the uninsured.</p>
        <p>Given this political context, some health experts see hopeful signs that this campaign has at least revived the debate -- and maybe even helped prepare the way for action next year.  ''The fact is they both take this issue seriously, they both have a plan,'' said Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gail Wilensky, a health adviser to Governor Bush and a top health official in his father's administration, said: ''Right before an election is a hard time to know where you are.  But potentially, come February or March, we may be able to make a move. And what we've clearly learned in the last eight years is that prosperity alone is not going to make this problem go away.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the number of uninsured rose throughout the long economic expansion; only last year, for the first time in 12 years, did their ranks begin to show a significant decline, according to recent Census Bureau data. Still, the numbers remain so large that many health advocates fear what would happen in an economic downturn.</p>
        <p>The two candidates' proposals reflect their different philosophical approaches. Mr. Bush would use refundable tax credits -- up to $2,000 for families and $1,000 for individuals -- to help low- and moderate-income families buy health insurance on the private market. The full tax credit would be available to families with incomes up to $30,000 and would gradually phase out at higher incomes, with a cutoff at $60,000. Mr. Bush would also provide $8 billion in additional money over 10 years to  community health centers.</p>
        <p>The main criticism of Mr. Bush's plan is that the tax credits are too small. ''He's offering $1,000 for an individual policy that on average costs $2,000, and $2,000 for a family policy that on average costs $6,000,'' said Dr. Judith Feder, dean of policy studies at Georgetown University, and a former top health adviser in the Clinton Administration. For a family making $30,000 or less, Dr. Feder argued, that's the equivalent of ''giving a 10-foot rope to people in a 30-foot hole.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would expand eligibility for the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover all children in families with incomes up to about $42,000; children in families with higher incomes, whose parents did not have coverage through their employers, would be allowed to buy into the program, with the help of a new federal tax credit. That credit, 25 percent of the health insurance premium, would be aimed at middle-income people who had to buy insurance on their own. Moreover, the children's program would be expanded to cover uninsured low-income parents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is proposing to spend more money on expanding coverage -- his campaign puts the price tag at $146 billion over 10 years, to Mr. Bush's $75.1 billion in the same time period -- and his focus on children and their parents has earned praise from advocacy groups.</p>
        <p>''If I had to pick two increments, I'd pick getting the job done for kids and providing meaningful coverage for low-income parents,'' Mr. Pollack said.</p>
        <p>But several health care experts said that a more notable step would be to combine the Bush and Gore proposals. ''I think there's a possibility of a real compromise after the election,'' Mr. Butler said, with conservatives willing to accept some expansion of the children's program  and liberals willing to accept a greater use of tax credits for more moderate income people.</p>
        <p>Dr. Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group, asserted, ''Ultimately, what would make most sense is if the two parties agreed to stop fighting over ideological differences and combined the two approaches.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Altman noted that for years, health analysts had assumed that the primary hurdle to doing something about the uninsured was the lack of money. Given the current surplus, he added, the basic question becomes,  ''If we're not able to deal with this issue now, when will we ever be able to deal with it?''</p>
