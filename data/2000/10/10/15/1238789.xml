        <p>Pop stars make great studies for caricature because of the mix of public image and self-disclosure in their performances. ROLLING STONE: The Illustrated Portraits (Chronicle, $40) is a compilation of more than 200 illustrations by almost 100 artists from 30 years of the magazine's history. The key to longevity, apparently, is, never appear the same way twice, and don't look back: Bob Dylan morphs from an angelically smooth-faced kid to thoughtful bearded bard in a line sketch by Milton Glaser to mirror-shaded rock star in a 1974 painting by Paul Davis. The illustrators show insight into the stars' psyches: Gary Kelley's picture of Madonna in the style of the art deco painter Tamara de Lempicka captures her narcissism, and a lacquered sculpture of Lou Reed, with leather jacket and still-smoking cigarette, expresses his deadpan cool. The text of interviews is unsatisfying, especially the throw-away reactions by the stars to their portraits. Printed on heavy paper, the images have an extra density and snap, but the succession of borderless, full-bleed pictures gives the feel of a workbook catalog. A major oversight is that the artists' media are nowhere discussed. Nevertheless, the book shows that when the match of illustrator and subject is just right, in the words of the caricaturist Robert Risko, the artist can ''get into their skin and try to find out what goes on in the inside by imitating the person's outside.''</p>
