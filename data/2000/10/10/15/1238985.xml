        <p>Plaid isn't just for trench coat linings anymore. After last year's craze for Burberry plaid, the fashion world is finding ways to tweak the tartan. This season, using whimsical materials like leather and fur, and processes like tie-dyeing and silk-screening, designers are exploding the pattern of decorum. Even Burberry breaks out of the traditional grid -- as witnessed by its new monochrome jacquard plaid ties and bold plaid high-heel boots. To be sure, too much of a good thing can cause ganglion overload: Don't try these combos outside your home.</p>
        <p>A gabardine cap of patchwork Burberry plaid with leather trim ($55) and a full-length 70's-style wool trench coat with shoulder pads ($375, both from Intermix) span the Faye Dunaway style gamut from ''Bonnie and Clyde'' to ''Network.'' Cynthia Rowley's red leather hip-huggers ($620) spice up the mix, while a quirky Patch doggie handbag ($245) and Dolce &amp; Gabbana gloves ($353, both at Saks Fifth Avenue) provide a lighter clutch.</p>
