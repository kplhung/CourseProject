        <p>SIGMUND BALKA knows his law. That's why he is general counsel of Krasdale Foods, a major grocery distributor with headquarters in White Plains and a distribution center in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>He also knows his art. In the last 14 years, Mr. Balka has mounted eight changing exhibitions a year, throughout the office spaces and conference rooms, turning Krasdale Galleries into prime alternative exhibition space.</p>
        <p>Mr. Balka talked about his curatorial work recently in a conference room in the Bronx, where the paintings of the Cuban-born painter Emilio Sanchez were displayed.</p>
        <p>Q. What is it that drives you to add an aggressive exhibition schedule to an already hectic itinerary as the head of Krasdale's legal department?</p>
        <p>A. My interest in the arts started when I was 4 or 5 years old. My parents, who were married in 1930, were influenced by the Depression, which set the tone for a conservative lifestyle. Despite her monetary limitations, my mother bought original paintings or an Oriental rug by asking the gallery to set them aside until she could pay for them. She did not settle for something that was just ordinary. My home environment was the basis for my appreciation for fine art and antiques.</p>
        <p>Q. That would explain your initial interest in art. Over the years, however, you've put together such an incredible variety of show themes: American art of the 1930's, art from Russia, Montreal, Israel, Mexican ceremonial masks, the art of the MacDowell Colony, an environmental show, a food show, a music show -- the list goes on and on. Where did you gather all of this additional knowledge and awareness?</p>
        <p>A. I was very fortunate to have attended Central High School in Philadelphia, where artists and collectors like Thomas Eakins, John Sloan, William Glackens and Dr. Albert Barnes went to school. Later, I went to Williams College, where many current museum directors and curators attended college. After graduating from Harvard Law School, I moved back to Philadelphia to practice law, which is where I first became acquainted with a number of prominent contemporary Philadelphia artists.</p>
        <p>A few years later, I moved to Washington,  where I was exposed to the art of the Washington Color School and the Washington Print Club. At that time, when I worked for the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, the centerpiece gallery of that area was the Franz Bader Gallery. There was also the Washington Gallery of Modern Art, where I saw the work of Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland for the first time.</p>
        <p>Q. What is it about the Krasdale offices that prompted you to put on these elaborate exhibitions?</p>
        <p>A. A bare wall is like a blank mind. I had been at the company for some years, when in 1986 I approached the president of Krasdale Foods, Charles A. Krasne, with the idea of doing exhibits so that employees, business visitors and the general public could be intellectually stimulated by changing exhibitions. At that time, Mr. Krasne said, ''Let's give it a shot.'' The response by just about everyone was tremendously positive. I'm proud of the fact that our exhibitions and, more specifically, the opening receptions provide a favorable way of linking the community.</p>
        <p>Q. It's not uncommon to see a corporate collection in an office space, but here it's different. You are not taking a typical corporate approach to displaying art. Why?</p>
        <p>A. I decided very early on that I would not try to appeal to the lowest common denominator. I thought it was worthwhile to have work that was provocative. I wanted art that would make people think. After a very short period of time, we realized that the employees were part of the whole enterprise -- the art became an integral part of their everyday life.</p>
        <p>Q. Can you clarify that?</p>
        <p>A. All of our employees were very accepting of what we were doing. It brought the company's employees closer together. They felt a part of something, which added to their quality of life. All of the employees have helped in one way or the other, and they have done so willingly.</p>
        <p>Q. Your current exhibition, ''Emilio Sanchez: A Life in Art,'' is certainly, for those who love color, a must see. How did this show come about?</p>
        <p>A. I've known and followed the career of Mr. Sanchez since 1985. He died recently, and I thought it fitting to have a retrospective of his paintings here at Krasdale. His work is in collections at institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. Sanchez's paintings are reminiscent of Edward Hopper: his focus on the effects of sunlight and how in all but his early works he de-emphasizes the existence of people in his art. What attracts you to his work?</p>
        <p>A. What you mentioned, of course, and the vivid way in which he asserts his Cuban heritage, which he combined with an architectural awareness. He has a dark side too. You could see the concerns and fears he had for the human condition in his paintings.</p>
        <p>''Emilio Sanchez: A Life in Art'' runs through Jan. 15. For more information and to schedule a visit, the numbers to call are (914) 694-6400, extension 2125, or (718) 378-1100, extension 2125.</p>
