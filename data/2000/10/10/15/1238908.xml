        <p>WHEN Ronald O. Ross became Mount Vernon's Superintendent of Schools in September 1998, the city's school board was bitterly divided along racial lines.</p>
        <p>''I saw that as a microcosm of America,'' Mr. Ross said. ''I grew up in the civil rights era, and I felt that if we could accomplish a change here in Mount Vernon that would be a model for the rest of the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross, 55, a tall, lanky man who speaks in the cadences of a preacher, said he believes that public schools can be a crucible of racial harmony.</p>
        <p>He developed that view over three decades as a teacher and school administrator, he said. Most recently, he spent two years as deputy superintendent in Hempstead on Long Island. Before that he was principal of Unity High School in Manhattan, and before that he was an administrator and social studies teacher at other New York City public schools.</p>
        <p>In Mount Vernon, Mr. Ross has earned a reputation as a strong advocate for teachers, said Jeff Yonkers, the president of the Mount Vernon Federation of Teachers. But he is also known for his outspoken approach. ''He will speak to issues most people dance around,'' including race, Mr. Yonkers said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross was born in Harlem, where his mother worked as a housekeeper and his father as a grocery store clerk and a messenger. He spent much of his childhood with his mother's family in northern Virginia after his parents divorced.</p>
        <p>He attributed his first career inspiration to his 12th-grade history teacher, who told him he would one day become a teacher, too. ''I laughed at him,'' Mr. Ross said. ''I had been accepted at M.I.T., and I thought I was going to be an engineer.''</p>
        <p>He chose instead to go to Howard University in Washington and went on to the University of North Dakota Law School, planning a career in law. But the year was 1968, and he was drafted. He avoided military service by applying to the Teacher Corps, a domestic education version of the Peace Corps created by President Lyndon B. Johnson. His assignment was in the James Fenimore Cooper Junior High School in Manhattan. He liked it and decided to teach one more year.</p>
        <p>''This makes my 31st year, and I'm still teaching one more year,'' he said.</p>
