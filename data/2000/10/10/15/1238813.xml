        <p>Niranjan Beri, Kabir Beri, Nirmita Mehrotra, Costco, Long Island City, N.Y., September 17, 2000</p>
        <p>Beri (behind baby): ''I was shopping with my son and my wife. I am behind the packages. When I go to Costco after two months the cart is full, all stacked up. It's cheaper, and you only have to do it for two or three hours, then you don't have to think of buying detergent, toilet paper or Bounty or Coke or juice. It's done. Of course, I look forward to going there. Everybody likes to go shopping; if this was not the case, the malls would be empty, deserted. I like the big things, the big things. In America everything is big. Specialty stores are O.K. for the guys who do not want to save money. I'm not among them. It's very satisfying.''</p>

        <p>Mehrotra (right): ''We buy everything from Costco. Sweaters, baby's sweaters, baby's night suits. We recently bought a VCR. We buy salt, sugar, butter. We save money by buying things in bulk. For example, the cashew nuts. The size they give us you can't buy in other stores. I haven't compared it with other stores, but from the name Costco we presume that we are saving money. We don't have to check. But we are always out of budget when we go to Costco. This time it was $320. It's exhausting. The baby Kabir was getting cranky. But we pacify ourselves.''</p>
