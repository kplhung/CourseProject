        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>AN AMERICAN STORY, by Debra J. Dickerson. (Pantheon, $24.) A frank and unsparing memoir by a smart, high-achieving African-American woman and Harvard-trained lawyer one generation from Mississippi who found that other blacks often discouraged and retarded her upward mobility while the Air Force, which she joined at 20, enhanced it.</p>
        <p>THUNDER FROM THE EAST: Portrait of a Rising Asia, by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. (Knopf, $27.50.) A highly circumstantial report on Asia that expects a glorious future for the continent as the world power center; by two staff members of The New York Times who both did duty as Times correspondents in Asia.</p>
        <p>THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER &amp; CLAY, by Michael Chabon. (Random House, $26.95.) A generous, optimistic, inventive and ambitious comic novel, set in the golden age of comic books (late 1930's to early 50's) and thematically permeated by two ideas: escape (from Nazism, from Brooklyn) and the mystery of the golem of Prague.</p>
        <p>QUARREL &amp; QUANDARY: Essays, by Cynthia Ozick. (Knopf, $25.) Accomplished, graceful work that began as reviews and higher journalism by an accomplished stylist who possesses, and offers in these essays to preserve, a moral gravity based on a literary education that is not much on offer anymore.</p>
        <p>THE TALMUD AND THE INTERNET: A Journey Between Worlds, by Jonathan Rosen. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $16.) A thought-provoking essay on two information systems, both of which are full of unforeseen linkages and contain all knowledge, if you know how to find it.</p>
        <p>WHEN WE WERE ORPHANS, by Kazuo Ishiguro. (Knopf, $25.) A novel that conceals great issues of identity and self-knowledge behind the facade of a detective story; its protagonist, a private eye in 1920's London, uses all his wits in the cause of deceiving himself, missing the call of freedom in the blindness his sense of obligation imposes.</p>
        <p>THE MAP OF LOVE, by Ahdaf Soueif. (Anchor, paper, $14.) Three women in nearly two centuries intersect in this novel as an American and an Egyptian make the loves and the politics of the past transpire from a trunk left by a late Victorian Englishwoman.</p>
        <p>THE COLLECTED POEMS, by Stanley Kunitz. (Norton, $27.95.) The life's work of the new poet laureate of the United States, now 95; much of it thematically and structurally interconnected, bold and generous in its statements about birth, death and the cosmos.</p>
        <p>EINSTEIN IN LOVE: A Scientific Romance, by Dennis Overbye. (Viking, $27.95.) An antiromance, really, in which Overbye, the deputy science editor of The Times, applies recent discoveries about Einstein to examine both his scientific work and his emotional life; in the end, he portrays the great scientist as a rat with women and an irresponsible father.</p>
