        <p>When Vice President Al Gore felt the need during the last presidential debate to say he was sorry that he ''got some of the details wrong'' in recent anecdotes, the admission was not just a sign that Mr. Gore had hurt himself with another misstatement.</p>
        <p>The moment also was the culmination of a skillful and sustained 18-month campaign by Republicans to portray the vice president as flawed and untrustworthy.</p>
        <p>Republican strategists say that long before Gov. George W. Bush and Mr. Gore emerged as their parties' respective nominees, they already knew that during a time of peace and prosperity, character would be one of their most important arguments for retaking the White House.</p>
        <p>And many in the Republican Party began using mockery to question Mr. Gore's veracity even before the nation was put through the turmoil of President Clinton's lies about his relationship with a White House intern.</p>
        <p>''I can hardly remember a time when it wasn't on our radar screen that Al Gore had a propensity to both exaggerate and fabricate,'' said Clifford May, the spokesman for the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>One of the first salvos came in December 1997, when the committee announced it had started a contest to come up with a slogan for Mr. Gore after he told reporters that the hero and heroine in the novel ''Love Story'' were modeled after him and his wife, Tipper. (Erich Segal, the author, soon said that his protagonist, Oliver Barrett IV, was only partly based on Mr. Gore, while Jenny Cavilleri had nothing to do with Tipper Gore.)</p>
        <p>''The R.N.C. wants your best 'Love Means . . .' slogan for Al and Tipper Gore,'' the party said in a press release. One of its suggested entries was ''Love means never having to tell the truth.''</p>
        <p>That was only the beginning. After President Clinton's impeachment, candidates in both parties prepared to run the 2000 presidential race as a referendum against Bill Clinton and his dissembling. And Republicans began seizing on comments by the vice president.</p>
        <p>So when Mr. Gore said in an interview with CNN in March 1999 that ''during my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet,'' Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, issued this mocking statement: ''During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the paper clip.''</p>
        <p>Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said, ''If the vice president created the Internet, then I created the Interstate highway system.''</p>
        <p>Michele A. Davis, Mr. Armey's spokeswoman, described the mocking of the Internet remark as spontaneous combustion. ''We all just leapt on it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But, she said, Mr. Armey's aides then became an informal clearinghouse for efforts in Congress to poke fun at Mr. Gore, such as readings on the House floor of the most oblique or provocative sections of his book ''Earth in the Balance.''</p>
        <p>''We would just kind of compile stuff and send it out to talk radio and to members,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On the day Mr. Gore formally announced his candidacy in Carthage, Tenn., his family's hometown, Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, had a more elaborate stunt. He rode in a wagon pulled by mules to the Westin Fairfax Hotel on Embassy Row in Washington where Mr. Gore lived for much of his youth.</p>
        <p>''He has tried to pass himself off as this hardscrabble, homespun central Tennessee farm boy and that is not what he is,'' said Mr. Nicholson, playing off the fact that Mr. Gore had told The Des Moines Register that he had learned to slop hogs and clear land on the family farm. Friends later told reporters that Mr. Gore's father had kept him on a backbreaking work schedule during summers on the family farm.</p>
        <p>The Republicans got help as well from an unexpected source. When the Democratic primary fight became bitter, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey insisted that Mr. Gore had deliberately distorted his policy positions in what he called a ''pattern of misrepresentation.'' At one point, Mr. Bradley spat out, ''Why should we believe that you will tell the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign subsequently used that remark at the top of its press releases. And they say that portraying Mr. Gore as an embellisher helps them raise doubts about Mr. Gore's assaults on Mr. Bush's proposals.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's aides say the Republicans have blown up trivial misstatements to turn the campaign away from such matters as tax cutting, health care and Social Security.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans have always known they would lose the campaign if it actually focused on issues that mattered in people's lives,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore.</p>
