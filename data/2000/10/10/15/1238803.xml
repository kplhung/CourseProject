        <p>LET me have my Farm, Family, and Goose Quil, and all the Honours and Offices this World can bestow, may go to those who deserve them better, and desire them more. I covet them not,'' John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, in 1776.</p>
        <p>Although the second president of the United States may not have been as talented a farmer as Abigail proved to be, his attachment to the rocky soil of his native Massachusetts and his longing for the simple pleasures of rural life in Quincy never abated during his long and distinguished career as lawyer, diplomat, and president of the country he helped create.</p>
        <p>Quincy may have lost its rural charm since John Adams wrote those plaintive lines, but it more than makes up for it in the richness of its presidential heritage. A city of 90,000 that lies just 10 miles south of Boston, Quincy today is as modest in demeanor as the famous family that called it home. But however incongruous it may seem to visitors expecting quaint, postcard-perfect  New England, it is in this hard-working town of quarries and shipyards that a portrait of the private world of America's earliest political patriarch emerges.</p>
        <p>As a New Englander with deep roots of my own and a passionate interest in the region's literary history, I was hoping for just such a glimpse when I visited the Adams National Historical Park in Quincy last April. Perhaps, too, in this election  year rife with comparisons of the Bushes  to the Adamses, I was hoping to gain a bit  of insight into the nature of political families.</p>
        <p>My husband, G. J., and I waited until the hoopla of Patriots Day -- the annual holiday commemorating the April 19, 1775, battles at Lexington and Concord -- was over before taking the drive from our Connecticut home to this city of presidents.</p>
        <p>Well-acquainted with John and Abigail's correspondence -- they were prolific and entertaining letter writers -- we felt we were visiting two old friends rather than making a literary or historical pilgrimage. But as the park deputy superintendent, Caroline Keinath, reminded me, visitors to the park are actually introduced to four generations of Adamses, including, of course, the sixth president, John Quincy Adams. His son Charles Francis served as Lincoln's ambassador to England during the Civil War and is credited with preventing British support of the Confederacy. Sons of the next generation, Brooks and Henry, are remembered as historians and writers. The latter's famous autobiography, ''The Education of Henry Adams,'' recounts the often painful Adams legacy of privilege and duty in which Quincy plays a significant role.</p>
        <p>Administered by the National Park Service, the Adams National Historical Park is actually a collection of sites scattered throughout the city. They include the Colonial-era birthplaces of the two Adams presidents and the family mansion called the Old House. Nearby, in the United First Parish Church, is the burial crypt of the presidents and their wives.</p>
        <p>Downtown Quincy, where the park's visitor center is situated, was quiet on that  Saturday morning, although along the main avenue, Hancock Street, small eateries with names like Patriot Lunch and the Colonial were open for breakfast. In this pleasant, unpretentious city, modern office buildings and fast food franchises coexist -- for better or worse -- with relics of the American Revolutionary past.</p>
        <p>We bought our tickets at the visitor center, perusing the exhibitions on Adams genealogy, and browsing through the bookshop before boarding the park trolley, along with a handful of other history buffs, for the two-mile ride to the presidential birthplaces. Wonderfully convenient and free of charge, the trolley makes a continuous loop around the various park sites.</p>
        <p>Two saltbox-style clapboard houses form a tiny Colonial enclave at the foot of Penn's Hill, in a present-day south Quincy neighborhood of gas stations and small retail shops. The older of the two, probably built in 1663, was the hub of a farm belonging to ''Deacon John'' and Susanna Adams and the place where their eldest son, John, came to live in 1764. Sparsely furnished with reproductions, the house suggests both the family's Puritan austerity and its energy. Deacon John was nothing if not an enterprising citizen. A farmer, town selectman and tax collector, he was also a shoemaker, his tiny shop a spartan room near the kitchen.</p>
        <p>We toured the chilly ground floors of the saltboxes in the company of a park ranger, Richard Stabile, who told us that young John Adams was just an average boy, with aspirations no greater than to work the family farm. But a brief stint at farming in his early teens persuaded him to follow Deacon John's advice to prepare for the ministry at Harvard. However, he never lost his preference for ''the Delights of a Garden to the Dominion of a World.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, John Adams settled on the law, not the pulpit, and established a practice in the house next door. Referred to as the John Quincy Adams birthplace, this Colonial saltbox -- as modestly furnished as the other -- tells the story of the family's Revolutionary War years, as the lawyer-farmer, his wife and their young children sacrificed their family life to the battle for nationhood.</p>
        <p>In 1764, John Adams married Abigail Smith, a minister's daughter from nearby Weymouth. Theirs was a marriage of minds as well as hearts. Their correspondence during the many periods of separation necessitated by war and John's travels abroad is surely one of their greatest legacies to the nation.</p>
        <p>Largely through her letters -- charmingly eccentric in their disregard for the niceties of English composition -- Abigail has taken on heroic stature as a figure of constancy and courage during the Revolutionary War, a woman who managed the farm and kept the family solvent during a time of privation, and who provided her husband with reliable accounts of local events. In this modest house she sold butter to neighbors and sheltered the homeless.</p>
        <p>It is hardly surprising, therefore, that in March 1776 Abigail admonished her husband to ''Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors.'' She promised he would face another rebellion as women of the new nation ''will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation.''</p>
        <p>Karen Yourell, the park ranger who was overseeing the visitor center that morning, has played the role of Abigail Adams in dramatic re-enactments of local events. She told me that Abigail was a ''typical 18th-century woman, a woman of her own time. She would probably be appalled at being called the first American feminist.'' But I am not quite so sure.</p>
        <p>Back on board the trolley, we headed to the Old House, about three miles north of the rustic saltboxes. In 1787 John and Abigail bought the place from Leonard Vassell, whose family had built the house in 1731. Although public office kept the couple from full-time residence until 1801, the house remained occupied by Adams family members until 1927.</p>
        <p>Situated on eight acres in a quiet and prosperous-looking Quincy neighborhood, the pewter-gray Old House is a sprawling family home set amid gardens and fruit trees, as graceful as the angular lines of the saltbox dwellings are severe. In the yard, the lilacs were in bloom, the very same lilacs planted by Abigail in 1788, according to the Park Service, and hundreds of daffodils and jonquils dotted the meadow behind the house.</p>
        <p>We were greeted on the front porch by Crystal Hallowell, another park ranger, who for the next hour guided us through the house and library, beginning with the dark mahogany-paneled first-floor salon, very likely the only room that looks much as it did when the house was built in 1731. Here the Adams family took afternoon tea. Henry Adams recorded in his autobiography his impressions of ''Madam,'' his grandmother Louisa Catherine, wife of John Quincy, as she served tea in the small salon: ''a vision of silver gray, presiding over her old President and her Queen Anne mahogany.''</p>
        <p>Before our visit I knew little about Louisa Catherine, who may well be the most enigmatic of the Adams clan. She was well educated and socially accomplished, but keenly felt herself an outsider. Brought up in Europe, she clashed with her formidable mother-in-law, Abigail, who questioned whether she held sufficiently American values. New England culture itself appeared strange to her. ''Had I steped into Noahs Ark I do not think I could have been more utterly astonished,'' she wrote.</p>
        <p>The Old House is a kind of Adams time capsule. Virtually everything in it -- furnishings, artwork, household goods -- belonged to the family, from the second-hand tables and chairs that thrifty John and Abigail brought back from France to the bedspread knitted by Louisa Catherine. But this is not a period house; it reflects modifications wrought by each successive generation.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, we peeked into the comfortable corner study where John Adams spent his last years as a retired president. His tall inlaid wooden secretary stands against one wall, a reminder of his days in France and his work on the 1783 Treaty of Paris, while his great-grandson Henry's writing desk occupies the middle of the room.</p>
        <p>At age 90, John Adams died in his study, on the strangely appropriate date of July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of his signing the Declaration of Independence. His last words were said to have been ''Jefferson survives.'' But he was wrong. In an amazing accident of history -- one that is well known today -- Adams's dear friend and the remaining surviving signer  had died four hours earlier at Monticello.</p>
        <p>Before leaving the Old House,  we visited the stone library built  by Charles Francis Adams in 1870. This passionately intellectual family needed a separate building to house some 14,000 books. Here we also found the old slant-top law desk  upon which John Adams drafted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1779,  a forerunner of the federal version.</p>
        <p>The trolley returned us to the downtown visitors center, just a block or two from the Hancock Cemetery where early Adams ancestors, including Deacon John, are buried. After wandering among the old headstones, we crossed the street to the United First Parish Church.</p>
        <p>In a narrow crypt beneath the elegant domed sanctuary, John Adams is entombed alongside Abigail, John Quincy and Louisa Catherine. The simplicity of the whitewashed crypt and the four granite sarcophagi is offset only by the splash of color provided by the American flags draping the presidents' remains. Alone in this small quiet space with two presidents and two remarkable first ladies, I felt tremendously moved by the modesty of their resting place given the greatness of their legacy.</p>
        <p>History remembers the Adamses as presidents and first ladies, public servants and recorders of history, but Quincy reminds us they were farmers and patriots, parents and children.</p>
        <p>And so G. J. and I preferred to  end our visit to Quincy at yet another, less somber, Adams monument. We drove up Penn's Hill, and not far from the saltbox farmhouses where the two presidents were born, we found the stone cairn marking  the summit from which Abigail Adams and her 7-year-old son, John Quincy, observed the battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. We couldn't help thinking that their vision  that day extended far past the smoke of battle, straight into the American future.</p>
        <p>Four generations and where they lived</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>By car: From Boston, take I-93 south to Exit 7 onto Route 3 south (direction Braintree-Cape Cod). Take Exit 18 (Washington Street/Quincy Center). Bear left to Burgin Parkway and follow signs to Quincy Center and the National Park Service Visitor Center.</p>
        <p>By subway: The M.B.T.A. (called the T) Red Line services Quincy. From Boston board the Braintree train to Quincy Center Station. Leave by the Hancock Street exit. The visitor center is across the street.</p>
        <p>By water shuttle: The Harbor Express, (617) 376-8417, leaves from Boston's Marriott Long Wharf to Quincy's Fore River Shipyard Terminal. From the terminal, take the Quincy City Shuttle (9 a.m. to 4 p.m., on the hour) to the visitor center.</p>
        <p>Visiting the Park</p>
        <p>The season at Adams National Historical Park runs from April 19 (Patriots Day) to Nov. 10. During the season, the park is open daily, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets must be bought at the visitor center, 1250 Hancock Street, (617) 770-1175; www.nps.gov/ adam. Out of season, the center remains open Tuesday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but the houses are not open to visitors. Admission: $2 age 17 and up. A separate $2 admission fee to visit the Adams burial crypts is collected at the United First Parish Church. Trolley service between the visitor center and park sites is free.</p>
        <p>Among the programs to bring the Adams family legacy to life is a schoolchildren's re-enactment of a debate among delegates to the Continental Congress over whether to remain loyal to the crown or vote for independence.</p>
        <p>Within the park, the Adams birthplaces are at 133 and 141 Franklin Street, and the Old House is at 135 Adams Street. The United First Parish Church (not technically part of the park) is one block south of the visitor center on Hancock Street; (617) 773-1290. The church is open daily from June to November, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>A broad range of accommodations is available in Boston.</p>
        <p>The best option in Quincy is the 100-room Best Western Adams Inn, 29 Hancock Street; (617) 328-1500, fax (617) 328-3067. Doubles start at $119 and include Continental breakfast.</p>
        <p>The 376-room Sheraton Braintree Hotel, at 37 Forbes Road, Braintree, (781) 848-0600, fax (781) 843-9492, is only a 10-minute drive from Adams Park sites. Off season rates are $99 to $169 for a double room.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>While downtown Quincy has numerous small lunchrooms suitable for breakfast or light lunches, visitors with cars will enjoy the trip to Marina Bay, just off the Quincy Shore Drive, a pleasant waterside complex of shops and restaurants offering a magnificent view of the Boston skyline. Siro's, 307 Victory Road, (617) 472-4500, serves updated contemporary cuisine with an Italian twist. Lunch or dinner for two, with wine, from $40.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The Quincy Historical Society Museum is in the old Adams Academy, 8 Adams Street, (617) 773-1144. Open all year, Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Weekend hours vary, so it is advisable to call ahead. Suggested donation $1.</p>
        <p>The Dorothy Quincy Homestead, 1010 Hancock Street, at Butler Road, an 18th-century Colonial mansion, was home to several generations of the prominent Quincy family, including Dorothy Quincy, wife of John Hancock. It was open to tours, but closed earlier this year because the Metropolitan District Commission, which owns it, had difficulty arranging for live-in caretakers and interpreters; it may reopen next spring.</p>
        <p>Information</p>
