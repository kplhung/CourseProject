        <p>ABOARD an early morning train to Manhattan, commuters from Westchester sipped their coffee and buried their heads in their newspapers. But one passenger, Lawrence Mandelker, noticed a fellow commuter with a book tucked discreetly between the pages of the paper.</p>
        <p>''Lady Chatterley's Lover?'' ''The Tropic of Cancer?''</p>
        <p>''Harry Potter,'' Mr. Mandelker said. Another passenger had his copy in full view.</p>
        <p>The commuters were off into an enchanted world where chess is played with live pieces who give advice (''Don't send me there! Can't you see his knight?'') and where journalists use ''Quick-Quotes Quills,'' a pen that zooms on its own over parchment and writes whatever slander it pleases during interviews.</p>
        <p>For those who have been sleeping, the popular series of children's books by J. K. Rowling are fantasy tales about a young wizard's coming of age among phantasmagorical friends, teachers and enemies. But Harry Potter has also crept into the grown-up imagination and filled a place untapped by adult fiction.</p>
        <p>''These books are a refreshing change from a lot of adult books that are more downbeat,'' said Mary Johnson, the librarian for the young adult section at the North Castle Public Library. ''It's an old-fashioned story told with enough complexity, word play and exceptionally good plotting to delight many adults. It gets darker and more adult as it goes along.''</p>
        <p>Roxana Robinson, a Katonah resident, novelist and book critic, found the books fun to read, she said, with a wonderful sense of narrative.</p>
        <p>''I love the women's view of the world,'' she said. ''The domestic notes are charming. The boy's dormitory room at Hogwarts School for Wizards with four-poster beds in a circle draped with cozy hangings, the common room with the armchairs and roaring fire where the students gather. This is not a place of exile but a center for their lives.</p>
        <p>''One of my favorites of the author's many vivid visual images is that of the ceiling in the dining room at Hogwarts, dotted with stars and bewitched to look like the sky outside. It's so exotic. It gives a sense of safety and shelter and a wonderful sense of beauty and enchantment -- thousands of glowing candles floating in the air, the idea of limitless possibilities,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Despite the magic, nasty things  befall good people, friends unexpectedly turn out to be enemies and vice-versa. Mr. Mandelker, a Katonah resident and Manhattan lawyer, said he found the triumphs over injustice in the book to be very satisfying.</p>
        <p>''Triumph and happiness are not givens,'' he said, ''so the story, which is a whopping good one, is believable. In Judaism there is a concept that you can't really be happy until you have been sad.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandelker said that when he read the first two Harry Potter books on the train he took off the jackets.  By the third book his unconventional side came out, and he left the jacket on.</p>
        <p>Not all adults find Harry Potter so charming. In fact, the series was at the top of the 1999 banned book list compiled by the American Library Association and No. 48 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of the last decade. The objection, said Larra Clark, press officer for the association, is the focus on wizardry and magic.</p>
        <p>Phyllis Steele, director of marketing at Riverdale Press, said she did not understand why so many adults  were crazy about Harry Potter. ''I read the first book,'' she said. ''To me it was pleasant, but it wasn't riveting. I could easily put it down and wait for the next day.''</p>
        <p>Eleanor Standard, a Pound Ridge resident and co-author of the anthology ''Bookworms: Great Writers and Readers Celebrate Reading'' (Carroll and Graf, 1991), said she found the fantasy and whimsy to be very smart but expected the whole thing to be slightly more clever.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Tinter, director of the Hiram Halle Library in Pound Ridge, said, ''I really opened myself to Harry Potter, but I had to read it through a child's eyes to feel the passion.''</p>
        <p>The issues of prejudice, class and discrimination, however, pulled her deeper into the underlying philosophical issues, Ms. Tinter said. Draco Malfoy, a mean, bigoted Hogwarts student of pure wizard blood, taunts Harry's friend Hermione for being ''muggle born.'' Muggles are ordinary, nonmagical folk. Draco sneers at Harry's wizard friend, Ron, for being poor.</p>
        <p>Karin Lippert, a former publicity director for Ms. Magazine and currently a documentary film producer, was bereft, she said, when she finished the fourth book and promptly reread the last 100 pages.</p>
        <p>''I don't remember kids in books from my childhood being so complex,'' she said. ''I love these characters the way I have loved other book characters in my life.''</p>
