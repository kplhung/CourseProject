        <p>RECORD low unemployment and the booming high-tech industry are causing a labor shortage in Westchester, posing problems for employers and spurring growth in reverse-commuting from New York City.</p>
        <p>The unemployment rate for the county was 3 percent for August, the lowest it has been since 1990, and down from 3.6 percent in August of last year.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the seasonally adjusted national rate was 4.1 percent in August, while New York State's was 4.5 percent and New York City's was 5.8 percent.</p>
        <p>''The data suggest that employers are hard pressed to attract and retain workers,'' said John L. Wieting, the regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''You've had a pretty good economy in Westchester, and employment expansion has been pretty steady.''</p>
        <p>Rae Rosen, a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank in Manhattan, agreed, saying, ''It's certainly tight right now.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, she said, the county had an average per capita income of $47,000, the eighth highest in the nation, adding, ''Obviously, this is a highly skilled labor market.'' The unemployment rate, while ''not an exact measurement, is indicative of a very tight labor market,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Harold E. Vogt, president of the county's Chamber of Commerce, said the labor shortage ''goes across the board,'' from highly technical jobs to entry-level and blue-collar positions. He attributed the shortage of high-tech workers to the rapid expansion of that industry and the shortage of low-wage workers on a historical lack of affordable housing in the county.</p>
        <p>Most companies have responded to the shortage by trying to lure workers from farther afield.</p>
        <p>Westchester employers have been recruiting from northern New Jersey, Dutchess, Orange and Rockland Counties and from Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''The ring is expanding,'' Mr. Vogt said. ''All you have to do is look at the Tappan Zee bridge in the morning.''</p>
        <p>Between 1980 and 1998 the number of people commuting into Westchester every day rose to 134,246 from 85,110, according to a study by the County Planning Department in March. During the same period the median price of a house rose to $363,900 from $83,700, making it harder for blue-collar workers to afford to live in the county.</p>
        <p>Commuters currently represent one-third of the county's work force, and the study predicted an increase to 40 percent over the next two decades.</p>
        <p>The only area from which commuting decreased was Manhattan. The most striking increase was from Queens and Brooklyn, which went from around 6,000 to just over 15,000 commuters.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosen of the Federal Reserve said that recent immigrants were picking up the slack in some blue-collar fields like masonry.</p>
        <p>It has been getting harder, however, to find minimum-wage workers in the county because of the costs of housing and commuting.</p>
        <p>''If you have a car you can make it from Queens,'' Ms. Rosen said. ''But it's hard to make it from the inner city.''</p>
        <p>The increase in reverse commuting has been a boon for the Metro-North Railroad, which has seen the number of riders going to Westchester during the morning rush increase by 240 percent, to more than 8,000, between 1986 and 1999. While that number pales in comparison with the 72,500 who commute into the city, it represents a surge in reverse commuting, said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for the railroad.</p>
        <p>''All over our system our ridership has been growing tremendously,'' Mr. Brucker said. ''But the growth rate of reverse and intermediate customers has outstripped all the other growth segments.''</p>
        <p>Lawrence C. Salley, the county's transportation commissioner, said that in the Bronx, Co-Op city, in particular, was sending more people to places like Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Like other county officials and business leaders, he said that companies were not leaving the county because of the labor shortage, and in fact many were moving in.</p>
        <p>''The businesses are here,'' he said. ''More businesses are coming in, and the housing is being developed as we speak.''</p>
        <p>Schools are having trouble finding staff members as well. While math and science teachers are in short supply, said Ernest J. Piermarini, an assistant superintendent for the Lakeland Central School District, ''We even have a hard time getting classroom monitors, teacher aide applicants, even basic clerical workers.''</p>
        <p>He said that, while the school system has increased pay in many areas, it could not compete with the private sector. ''You'll get people who come out here, and then after a couple of months they'll go to Wal-Mart and Home Depot.''</p>
        <p>The scarcity of high-tech workers is being felt across the country as companies scramble to expand.</p>
        <p>''It's really a national issue,'' said Russ Izzo, president of Nextech Training Solutions, which trains computer programmers, systems engineers, and the like. ''The demand in Westchester is pretty much in line'' with the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>His company recently opened an office in White Plains. He said that graduates were being grabbed by companies and entry-level salaries were more than $30,000, compared with $20,000 a year ago.</p>
        <p>Many big retailers said they were having similar problems finding workers.</p>
        <p>''It's been tougher this year than it's ever been,'' said the manager of the Wal-Mart in Mohegan Lake, who asked that his name not be used.</p>
        <p>He said that while the store, which employs 300 people, wasn't understaffed, he would hire an extra 20 workers if he had qualified applicants.</p>
        <p>While the K-mart in Mahopac reported having similar problems finding enough workers, McDonald's says it has not had a problem.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of long-term people,'' said Peter Samaha, who owns and operates 12 McDonald's, 10 of them in Westchester. He cited a flexible work schedule and fair pay ''so when a labor crunch comes, we're usually ahead of the curve.''</p>
