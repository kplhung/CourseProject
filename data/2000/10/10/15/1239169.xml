        <p>Arkansas Democrats loved Al Gore back in 1988, when the state was one of only five where he won the party primary on his first presidential campaign. But now, even the Democratic Party headquarters of this rapidly growing city north of Little Rock is steeped in doubt and political ambivalence, much like the rest of the state and several of its Southern neighbors.</p>
        <p>''I have to admit, even I'm not that enthusiastic about Gore,'' said Bill Yates, a city councilman who was staffing the party office downtown, while sitting beneath a Gore-Lieberman poster.

        <p>Arkansas Democrats loved Al Gore back in 1988, when the state was one of only five where he won the party primary on his first presidential campaign. But now, even the Democratic Party headquarters of this rapidly growing city north of Little Rock is steeped in doubt and political ambivalence, much like the rest of the state and several of its Southern neighbors.</p>
        <p>''I have to admit, even I'm not that enthusiastic about Gore,'' said Bill Yates, a city councilman who was staffing the party office downtown, while sitting beneath a Gore-Lieberman poster. ''I'll probably vote for him, but most people around here are pretty embarrassed about what Clinton did, and that's going to rub off on Gore. He'll be very lucky if he wins the state.''</p>
        <p>Arkansas, along with Tennessee and Florida, has been one of the states where Mr. Gore is hoping to avoid a Southern shutout, but despite three visits and a barrage of television advertisements, he has not been able to establish a lead here. Although the state has voted Democratic in 26 out of 33 presidential elections, a poll conducted two weeks ago for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas at 45 percent and Mr. Gore at 43 percent, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>
        <p>Tennessee, Mr. Gore's home state to the east, is similarly divided, and to the south in Louisiana, which the Clinton-Gore ticket won handily in 1992 and overwhelmingly in 1996, Mr. Bush has been consistently ahead. A survey late last month by Southern Media and Opinion Research for several Louisiana television stations showed Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore 44 percent to 38 percent among registered, likely voters, with a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.</p>
        <p>There are clearly some demographic reasons for this division, mostly the increasing Republican presence in suburban areas like Conway, which has grown by more than 50 percent in the last decade to about 40,000. President Clinton's home state, the last of the Democratic redoubts in the South, has sloughed off its party loyalty over the last decade and begun electing Republicans to the governor's office, the United States Senate and the House. The northwest quadrant of the state, in particular, has become a magnet for mostly Republican retirees, and is the home base of Senator Tim Hutchinson and his brother, Representative Asa Hutchinson, a leader in the effort to impeach Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In interviews this week, many residents in Arkansas and Louisiana were quite specific in their criticisms of Mr. Gore, repeatedly voicing three themes that are leading them to think seriously about voting for Mr. Bush. Most often cited is the vice president's failure to separate himself from Mr. Clinton's scandals, which remain an open wound to many Arkansans. His support for gun control is unpopular among men here and elsewhere in the South, despite his insistence that he would not affect the rights of hunters.</p>
        <p>And there is also a widespread if tentatively voiced sense that Mr. Gore's personality is simply not as ''Southern'' as Mr. Bush's, that he lacks the easy backslapping boyishness that is the lubricant of the region's politics.</p>
        <p>''I've voted for him before, but not this time,'' said Liza Allen, 49, who teaches geometry and computer science at Conway High School and was one of hundreds of people who gathered for a pep rally for the school football team at the city park on Thursday. ''It's like he's different this time, too Washington. He should have stood up against what Clinton did when it happened, but he waited till the campaign to do it. I guess he proved me wrong.''</p>
        <p>There were, of course, many Gore supporters at the rally, some of whom voiced enthusiasm for his tax plan and doubts about Mr. Bush's intelligence and ability. Many of them, however, said they would vote Democratic simply because they always had.</p>
        <p>''I come from a yellow-dog Democrat family, so you know what I'm going to do,'' said Lori Case, 37, vice president for marketing of First State Bank, who along with other bank employees was grilling cheeseburgers for the rally. ''But the thing I hear people talk about the most is their personalities. It's huge. They're both so boring, and that's why they're so close in the polls.''</p>
        <p>Both candidates are spending an unusual amount of time and money contesting the state's six electoral votes, but Art English, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, said Mr. Bush's five visits -- which included a stop at Central High School, the civil rights shrine -- have been more successful, drawing more media attention and more enthusiastic crowds.</p>
        <p>Vaughn McQuary, chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party, said he believed Mr. Gore would eventually win the state once older voters focused on his Medicare plan, but Mr. McQuary acknowledged that the vice president's stand in favor of greater gun control was hurting him.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans have done a pretty good job pounding on the gun issue,'' he said. ''Hey, I'm a big duck hunter, and I know Al Gore isn't going to do anything to keep anyone in Arkansas out of a duck blind. But we have to do a better job of communicating that to people, because it's a big issue here.''</p>
        <p>Louisiana, with its heavy dependence on the oil and chemical industries, has not looked favorably on Mr. Gore's environmentalist passions, and many residents consider Mr. Bush a more familiar next-door neighbor, particularly considering his oil background. But Mr. Gore's valedictorian persona could not be more at odds with the raffish personal character that the state's voters have traditionally admired in a politician and enjoyed in Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Bernard Pinsonat, who conducted the Southern Media poll, said Mr. Gore is likely to get almost all the black votes in Louisiana, but at this point is supported by only a quarter of white voters. Mr. Clinton, on the other hand, always drew at least 35 percent of the white vote, Mr. Pinsonat said.</p>
        <p>One of those white voters -- Jackie Berthelat, 46, who works in the pharmaceutical industry and was cradling an infant at the Lakeside Mall in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans -- said he was supporting Mr. Bush purely in opposition to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''It's what Gore is like to me as a candidate,'' Mr. Berthelat said. ''I find him extremely boring, I don't find him trustworthy and I think he fabricates a lot of stories.''</p>
        <p>Pam Washington, 52, an assistant at a New Orleans Montessori school, said her support for Mr. Gore would be more fervent if she were not so worried about his penchant for exaggeration.</p>
        <p>''Let's put it this way,'' she said. ''I'm voting for Lieberman.''</p>
