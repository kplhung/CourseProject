        <p>The St. Louis Cardinals came out swinging, the Mets went down looking, and the National League Championship Series suddenly has a very different feel to it.</p>
        <p>The Mets mounted a desperate rally in the ninth inning of Game 3 yesterday, putting two runners on and forcing Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa to use his closer, Dave Veres, to protect a six-run lead. Veres faced three Mets, and all took a called third strike.</p>
        <p>It was an apt conclusion to an 8-2 Cardinals victory in which the Mets absorbed all the body blows and never got up off the mat. They scored both of their runs on double plays.</p>
        <p>''Every time we punched back,'' first baseman Todd Zeile said, ''they punched back twice.''</p>
        <p>After losing the first two games of the series at home, the Cardinals littered Shea Stadium with 14 hits. The Mets lead the four-of-seven-game series by two games to one, but with St. Louis using Darryl Kile, its No. 1 starter, for Game 4 tonight, this seems to be a much more competitive series.</p>
        <p>''We beat Kile in Game 1, so we'll have to do it again,'' said Mets outfielder Darryl Hamilton, who flied out to stifle a potential rally in the fourth inning. ''We never thought this series was going to be easy, and it's not. There's a long way to go. It'd be great to go and win four in a row, but that doesn't happen very often.''</p>
        <p>Rick Reed sustained most of the pounding, allowing eight hits and five runs over three and a third innings. When he left the game trailing by 5-1, he fired his glove against the dugout wall, slapped a paper cup off the Gatorade bucket and retreated to the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>There was not much left to see besides the dominance of Cardinals starter Andy Benes, who held the Mets to six hits and two runs over eight innings. The only Met with two hits off Benes was Edgardo Alfonzo, who extended his postseason hitting streak to nine games, a club record.</p>
        <p>Benes was throwing to Carlos Hernandez, who came to St. Louis in a midseason trade. Because he was not familiar with Benes, Hernandez called a different game, getting Benes out of his pattern of mainly throwing fastballs. The Mets were flummoxed.</p>
        <p>''Some pitchers, you can see they change their style and get a little bit more aggressive in the zone when they get a lead,'' Zeile said. ''He didn't. He still picked the corners, used the slider -- even 3-2 sliders with an 8-2 lead. He wasn't going to let himself get out of his game plan, because it had been working.''</p>
        <p>Reed never got into his. The Cardinals had a .333 average off him in two starts during the regular season, and yesterday even their outs were hard smashes. Reed relies on locating his pitches, and they were up in the strike zone because he was rushing his delivery, something he does perhaps five times a year. ''I wish it had waited until spring training,'' Reed said.</p>
        <p>Three batters into the game, the Cardinals had two runs for their first lead of the series. Fernando Vina smacked a leadoff single to left, then Edgar Renteria dropped a bunt in front of Robin Ventura at third.</p>
        <p>Ventura approached it with his bare hand extended, but reconsidered and tried to glove it. He could not pick up the ball and was charged with an error, and Jim Edmonds followed with a two-run double to the left-field corner.</p>
        <p>Will Clark singled on the next pitch, but Reed recovered, striking out the next three batters. He worked a 1-2-3 second inning, but knew something was wrong.</p>
        <p>''My pitches were up,'' Reed said. ''I got away with some pitches that inning, and I just wasn't able to iron it out.''</p>
        <p>The Cardinals hit Reed hard, scoring twice in the third and once in the fourth before he was pulled with one out and two on. In calling for the left-hander Glendon Rusch, Manager Bobby Valentine summoned a pitcher who had handled the Cardinals much better than Reed, allowing a .188 average in two starts.</p>
        <p>Rusch fanned Edmonds, walked Clark to load the bases, then stared in at Mark McGwire, the sore-kneed slugger limited to pinch-hitting in this series.</p>
        <p>Rusch, who has learned to trust his average fastball, buzzed McGwire up and in, then went away. He came inside again and got McGwire to fly out harmlessly to left. ''If he hits that up a little more, he probably hits it to the parking lot,'' Rusch said.</p>
        <p>But Rusch had survived, and the only problem was leaving him in. In the bottom of the inning, with a run in on Jay Payton's double-play grounder and runners on first and third, Valentine had to call for Hamilton to pinch-hit for Rusch. When Hamilton flied out, the life went out of the Mets.</p>
        <p>''Probably the feeling of going flat was the inning where I had bases loaded and I didn't come up with a hit,'' Payton said. ''We got a run and made it 5-2, but we should have come out of that inning with more runs. After that, we didn't really have it, and Benes did a good job.''</p>
        <p>Rick White came on for the fifth, and Fernando Tatis bashed his first pitch off the plexiglass in front of the left-field bullpen for a double. After that, White tried to establish his breaking pitches because he had seen the Cardinals pummel Reed's fastballs.</p>
        <p>But White was helpless: he had no control of his curveball or slider. Whenever he used them, the pitches drifted over the middle of the plate, and the Cardinals pounded away.</p>
        <p>''I'm just glad I didn't give up more than three runs,'' White said. ''Otherwise, everyone would have been sitting there from the fifth inning on, thinking there's no way we can come back.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets believed they could recover, they did not show it on the field. Benes retired 12 of 13 hitters from the fifth through the eighth, winning for the first time in eight career postseason games.</p>
        <p>It was a vital victory for the Cardinals; no team in baseball history has recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win a four-of-seven-game series. The burden of coming back is still on St. Louis, as the Mets reminded themselves.</p>
        <p>''We'd rather be us than them at this point,'' Zeile said. ''We have to bounce back and try to get to Kile early. He's the type of pitcher that gets better as the game goes on. It was important when we got to him early in St. Louis, and that's something we're going to try to do tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets left-hander GLENDON RUSCH said he would be available to pitch in Game 4 today. . . . How much does Mets Manager BOBBY VALENTINE like ICHIRO SUZUKI, the Japanese outfielder who hopes to sign with an American team this winter? ''He's one of the top five players in the world,'' Valentine said. . . . General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS, who barred the Yankees from using the Mets' weight room after ROGER CLEMENS hit MIKE PIAZZA in the head in July, said he will extend that courtesy if the teams meet in the World Series. ''It'll be open facilities for the New York Yankees, if we get to that point,'' Phillips said.</p>
