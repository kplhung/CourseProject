        <p>AS one of the most sought-after venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers has a lot on his shoulders. About 50 pounds, to be exact, in a large black leather briefcase.</p>
        <p>As might be expected, his briefcase is filled with all kinds of gadgets: a Handspring Visor organizer with an MP3 audio player (both made by companies that Kleiner backs), a RIM BlackBerry two-way pager, two stan- dard pagers, a cell phone, and a laptop with an attachable floppy disk drive and speakers and Ethernet cards.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are spare batteries and a transformer for his laptop, too.</p>
        <p>But he also carries his political persuasion. There are two ''Geeks for Gore'' pocket pro- tectors, which he has not yet used, from an Elton John concert and fund-raiser in Silicon Valley a few weeks ago. ''I think Elton John is awesome,'' said Mr. Doerr, a big contributor to the Democratic Party and also a fan of Paul Simon and James Taylor, whose music he called rock from my genera- tion.</p>
        <p>Also inside are 10 yel- low ''Yes on 39'' buttons, in support of Proposition 39, an initiative to overhaul school bond spending and build new classrooms in California. ''One of my passions is trying to work to improve public education,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And then there are photographs of his two children, who, he noted, attend public schools.</p>
        <p>With him at all times, too, is a Nikon digital camera and an old-fashioned 35-millimeter camera. For several years, Mr. Doerr has been taking digital pictures of many of the people he meets. ''I print them, share them, e-mail them, post them on Zing.com, which is a community Web site that I love,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Theyre fun.</p>
