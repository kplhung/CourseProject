        <p>FOR the first time since World War II, when overseas trips were controlled by an entirely different agenda, off-peak travel to Europe from the United States has exceeded peak-season levels. Figures released last month by the Office of Tourism Industries, part of the United States Commerce Department, show that the departures of United States citizens for the off-peak months of October 1999 through April 2000 totaled 5,918,726, slightly more than the May-through-September 1999 peak-season total, 5,918,631.</p>
        <p>A difference of 95 people -- less than the average plane load of American tourists -- may not seem like much, especially with off-peak having a seven-to-five advantage over peak in the number of months used for record keeping. But the significance becomes clearer when comparing the last two off-peak seasons for European travel by Americans. The most recent numbers show an 8.1 percent increase over the October 1998-April 1999 total, 5,475,881.</p>

        <p>FOR the first time since World War II, when overseas trips were controlled by an entirely different agenda, off-peak travel to Europe from the United States has exceeded peak-season levels. Figures released last month by the Office of Tourism Industries, part of the United States Commerce Department, show that the departures of United States citizens for the off-peak months of October 1999 through April 2000 totaled 5,918,726, slightly more than the May-through-September 1999 peak-season total, 5,918,631.</p>
        <p>A difference of 95 people -- less than the average plane load of American tourists -- may not seem like much, especially with off-peak having a seven-to-five advantage over peak in the number of months used for record keeping. But the significance becomes clearer when comparing the last two off-peak seasons for European travel by Americans. The most recent numbers show an 8.1 percent increase over the October 1998-April 1999 total, 5,475,881.</p>
        <p>Compare that with the 4.2 percent increase in 1999 peak-season United States-Europe travel versus 1998 peak season, and the trend is unmistakable. The main reasons for it are not hard to figure out, either: much lower trans-Atlantic fares and much smaller crowds in Europe.</p>
        <p>''There are screaming deals out there,'' said Mary Louise Seifert, executive vice president at Welcome Aboard Vacation Center, a travel agency in Scottsdale, Ariz. ''We have 14 people booked on a five-night package to Paris for the first week of December. It's $660, including air fare, hotel, Continental breakfast and transfers. They're going over to do their Christmas shopping.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Seifert also said that a British Airways wintertime round-trip fare from Phoenix to London, $379, is less than the round-trip fare to New York.</p>
        <p>Travel agents are preaching the off-season gospel, too. ''I generally recommend to people that they travel to Europe in fall,'' said Veronica Liadis, owner of Liadis Travel in Newtown Square, Pa., outside Philadelphia. ''The weather is still good, the water is still warm and the backpackers and families have gone home.''</p>
        <p>And some European cities are weatherproof, she said. ''Nobody goes to London for the weather,'' she said. ''So it doesn't matter if you go in June or November. And Paris is another city like that.''</p>
        <p>Regarding the City of Light, some more lights apparently have come on when it comes to off-peak travel. Total foreign visits to France were 12.3 million in the first three months of 1997 (the most recent figures available), an increase of almost 50 percent from the same period in 1994, making it the largest increase among the four quarters of the 1994-1997 comparison.</p>
        <p>Christian Mantei, head of the Office du Tourisme et des Congres du Paris, said that he had noticed an increase in shopping tourism, especially in winter, and that the city would soon try to capitalize on the trend with a worldwide ad campaign on this theme.</p>
        <p>But there's a certain romance that just doesn't freeze well. The operators of the bateaux-mouches say that summer is still peak season for cruising the Seine.</p>
