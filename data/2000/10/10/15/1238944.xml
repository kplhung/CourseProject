        <p>ABOUT making the piano sing: it seems impossible -- after all, the piano is a percussion instrument with a Rube Goldberg construction. Its strings are not stroked by a bow, but hit with little hammers attached through a mechanism to each key. On the other hand, when Evgeny Kissin plays Liszt piano transcriptions of Schumann's or Schubert songs, (on Red Seal and Deutsche Grammophon labels) the fluid tone sounds as if some mystical singer is smoothing notes into a blended line.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissin's musicianship is remarkable in every aspect of phrasing, technique and flair. But equally remarkable is the complete absence, aside from his artistry, of anything remarkable at all. Interviewers approach him like fairytale suitors vying for royal attention, struggling to find the personal detail (''Do you exercise? Have you ever been drunk? Are you planning to marry?'') that might make him confide something to their readers, or show welcome eccentricity, like, say, Horowitz's, with whose playing Mr. Kissin's is often compared.</p>

        <p>ABOUT making the piano sing: it seems impossible -- after all, the piano is a percussion instrument with a Rube Goldberg construction. Its strings are not stroked by a bow, but hit with little hammers attached through a mechanism to each key. On the other hand, when Evgeny Kissin plays Liszt piano transcriptions of Schumann's or Schubert songs, (on Red Seal and Deutsche Grammophon labels) the fluid tone sounds as if some mystical singer is smoothing notes into a blended line.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissin's musicianship is remarkable in every aspect of phrasing, technique and flair. But equally remarkable is the complete absence, aside from his artistry, of anything remarkable at all. Interviewers approach him like fairytale suitors vying for royal attention, struggling to find the personal detail (''Do you exercise? Have you ever been drunk? Are you planning to marry?'') that might make him confide something to their readers, or show welcome eccentricity, like, say, Horowitz's, with whose playing Mr. Kissin's is often compared.</p>
        <p>The curly-haired Russian expatriate, who turned 29 last week, courteously takes on all comers, answering questions with reasonable thought -- even tact. But like all suitors who are not Prince Charming, they come away empty-handed, and have to stick to the music.</p>
        <p>Having left Moscow with his family to avoid conscription, he is making a national tour for the 10th anniversary of his American debut. In what has become a routine phenomenon, most of Carnegie Hall's seats were sold in a day. Yesterday's recital there was no exception, but Jerseyans who act fast can hear Mr. Kissin on Wednesday at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, whose acoustics he praises without being asked.</p>
        <p>His sole tour program has nothing odd or far-out, but is drawn from the well of standard literature: sonatas by Beethoven and Brahms, and Schumann's ''Carnaval.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Kissin leans toward sprawling, virtuosic Russian and late Romantic repertory, he does not neglect earlier, more structured works, as this tour program shows. Most performers take two programs on each tour, sometimes making different combinations, the way travelers pack a couple of coordinated outfits. But Mr. Kissin plays the same program at each appearance.</p>
        <p>''The choice of repertory is very big for us pianists,'' he said on the phone from St. Paul. ''I choose from works I'm especially fond of, and try to think how to make a good program. I change it quite often, but not during the same tour. It's much easier.''</p>
        <p>It leaves him time to do what interviewers don't succeed in uncovering, and it looks like that's probably practicing and thinking about music.</p>
        <p>What does not appear among his selections is music by his contemporaries, or indeed by anyone composing after the first half of the 20th century. Rachmaninoff, in whose concertos and solo works Mr. Kissin is without peer, died in 1943, and Prokofiev 10 years later. Fortunately most listeners, particularly outside the largest North American cities, prefer standards to new music.</p>
        <p>''It's all very simple,'' he said. ''Of all the music of living composers I've heard, I haven't heard anything on the level of the great classics. I see no reason to play music that is not great enough. I have no prejudice whatsoever against contemporary music as such, but after Olivier Messiaen, I don't know of any living composers who are of that level.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kissin's prodigal talent was apparent before he was 2 years old, but his mother, a piano teacher, didn't see a living in his piano playing and hoped he would be an engineer like his father.</p>
        <p>Far from being groomed like an athlete or pushed by a driven stage mom, he was treated as a normal child and allowed to proceed at his own pleasure, during which undisturbed years he shaped his own world.</p>
        <p>His teacher, Anna Pavlovna Kantor, was loath to muddle his gifted imagination with exercises: her methods served him so well that he never studied with anyone else, and she is now part of his family.</p>
        <p>On stage, his demeanor entirely appropriate, he acknowledges the audience with no pandering or avoidance, but once he begins to play, he is bringing serenity to his soul, and if listeners like it, good for them. But at encore time, he delights in pleasing the audience with a generous range of dazzlers and miniatures. ''I play as many as they want,'' he said. ''I like doing it. I don't impose encores, but I don't make them beg me, either.''</p>
        <p>EVGENY KISSIN  New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark.  Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.  (888) 466-5722.</p>
