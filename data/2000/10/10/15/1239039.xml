        <p>IT happened last June, on a day early in the month when the air was still sweet and full of possibilities. I'd had lunch on Carnegie Hill with my mother and an old friend of hers, a former war correspondent who'd just written a novel.</p>
        <p>We talked about clothes and jobs and books, and I left the restaurant all fired up by their conversation. I was transported for a fateful hour or so, imagining them as they had been, plucky working girls making their way in the big city, in crisp white shirtwaists. And I wanted a piece of what they had had, a stylish moment, or maybe just a new pair of shoes.</p>

        <p>IT happened last June, on a day early in the month when the air was still sweet and full of possibilities. I'd had lunch on Carnegie Hill with my mother and an old friend of hers, a former war correspondent who'd just written a novel.</p>
        <p>We talked about clothes and jobs and books, and I left the restaurant all fired up by their conversation. I was transported for a fateful hour or so, imagining them as they had been, plucky working girls making their way in the big city, in crisp white shirtwaists. And I wanted a piece of what they had had, a stylish moment, or maybe just a new pair of shoes.</p>
        <p>I remembered the way the war correspondent had covered fashion before her wars, how vividly she painted the audiences in the Paris ateliers, and then, flicking an imaginary but very sharp pencil with the tip of my tongue, I strode into the Prada store at 70th and Madison. It wasn't Paris, but here was Fashion, nonetheless, and I was all agog.</p>
        <p>Now the Prada store is a sort of repulsive box, with its grubby pistachio walls. (''It's a Renaissance color,'' a manager told me, ''the color of a church dome.'') You have to push yourself through that door. It seemed particularly repellent that afternoon, because the day was so fine and bright, but the clothes drew me in, even the goofy chiffons with the lips printed all over them, and the nighties with their ribbons. I'd read about the fur tippets and the tweeds that would follow these chiffons and silks, and it felt good to be among them, in the swing of things at last.</p>
        <p>I saw spectator shoes, and pumps with those weird molded heels that look like ducks' bills. I tried on a pair of angry looking heels, the kind with the articulated uppers that come to a squared-off point, like the shoes the Wicked Witch of the West sported in the Wizard of Oz. The veins on my feet popped in protest, and a saleswoman with a neat black bob brought me a pair of perfectly flat black slides, each shoe decorated with a large and shiny silver metal cutout of a heart.</p>
        <p>''These are the last pair,'' she said, smiling. ''I've been keeping them in the back.'' How clever they looked! How clever I felt for having ''found'' them. At $368.05, I couldn't buy them fast enough.</p>
        <p>''I've seen tackier,'' a friend said drily, days later, after the shoes had come home in their white bag with the navy blue Prada emblem, and the shoe guy had rubbered the soles, making them irrevocably mine. She was right, the shoes were tacky. Had they always been? What a difference a week makes. The shoes had soured. What was once beautiful seemed banal; coyness -- those hearts -- was revealed to be just corniness. The object, so of its moment, lost its luster as its moment passed. Pfft.</p>
        <p>More than four months have passed, but the shoes still irritate, and I'm the patsy in a hasty marriage. What ever happened? Did the shoes go bad, or did I?</p>
        <p>Such a knotty problem! I laid it on the laps of a few local aesthetes, experts in matters of form and value and taste.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe in obsolescence,'' said Paola Antonelli, curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, ''just patience. Put your shoes away. Prada shoes can be very strong, and that can cause tension. Put them away and use them later. There are no trends today -- things can't go stale -- there is only composition.''</p>
        <p>Ask around, and you'll find no one believes in seasonal obsolescence anymore. Take that, Roland Barthes. Michelle Kessler, the accessories director at Vogue magazine, called from a restaurant in Paris last week and explained that today the elapsed time between ''last season'' and ''vintage'' has shrunk to mere months. How delightful. Now, you can never be out of style, just witty in your vintage duds.</p>
        <p>''It's a cliche to say this, but everything happens so fast,'' Ms. Kessler said. ''The 'lady' things are in stores right now, and here we are in Paris looking at this sort of tough chic, all these grommets and rivets.'' Meanwhile, Ms. Kessler is wearing Prada shoes from 1996, she said. That's an ancient vintage, if you follow the current fashion calculus, and so kudos should accrue to Ms. Kessler for her canny eye.</p>
        <p>This week, Prada is selling fur tippets and thick tweeds -- the ''lady'' things, items we've seen advertised for six months in the pages of fashion and general features magazines. But we're also seeing on television and in newspaper fashion pages the same images Ms. Kessler has just seen on the runway, those grim grommets and dour colors, which make the stuff selling in the stores right now feel doubly stale. That means that in a month or so, you might sport it with ironic aplomb. I think.</p>
        <p>''All vintage stuff has to be worn with irony,'' said Tobi Tobias, a vintage clothes wearer and the author of ''Obsessed by Dress'' (Beacon Press; October). ''It's like the Kennedy Fraser line, about seeking style obliquely. That obliqueness is a kind of irony.'' Ms. Tobias was less than sanguine about my shoes, however, or my own ironic capabilities. ''You were caught, I think,'' she mused. ''Burned by fashion. How painful!''</p>
        <p>She's right. I lack the swagger an ironic deployment would require. ''You might try violence,'' Ms. Tobias suggested. ''Bury the shoes with a stiletto through their insteps.''</p>
        <p>Or save them, as a lurid cautionary tale.</p>
        <p>''If you give them away,'' said Kristen Frederickson, an art historian and co-editor of ''Singular Women: Writing the Artist'' (out next year from the University of California Press), ''you'll forget that you were, er . . . '' she paused delicately.</p>
        <p>A rube? ''Yeah, O.K., a rube. Prada shoes can be so specific, the word I'd use is 'hyperspecific,' they border on novelty,'' Ms. Frederickson continued, fresh from a weekend visit to Miu Miu, the Prada satellite in SoHo. ''That's what's initially appealing. Their value derives from this novelty, which means that once you get used to the thing, its value is gone. Put another way, once you lay eyes on the shoes, you realize that the point of having the shoes is over. I think there are some people who have more tolerance, people who don't have a long-lasting commitment to their own style.''</p>
        <p>Well, yeah. My friend Roberta suggested I'd developed an allergy to things, a hypersensitivity. ''Which means it could pass,'' she said. ''Or else you're suffering from your own lack of confidence. Your loss of love. Shopping is awfully fraught. You should never do it by yourself.''</p>
        <p>Betty Halbreich, a self-described fashion therapist, who has been treating patients with symptoms like mine at Bergdorf Goodman for close to a quarter century, prescribed a brutal treatment. ''I'd say flush 'em if they'd go down.'' she said. ''Love doesn't come back. Get rid, get rid.''</p>
        <p>I don't know if I can. Those shoes have become Mrs. Rochester in the attic. Still, I started scanning EBay, to see if there was any appetite for ''old'' Prada out there. A week and a half ago, there were 123 pairs of Prada shoes on auction: ''NEW authentic Prada SPECTACULAR shoes!'' ''PRADA MEETS BEBE STYLE! SEXY SHOES! L@@K!'' And this one, ''GREAT NEW PRADA SHOES,'' upon which I placed a bid. Days passed, and mine remained the high bid. As of closing time for this article, it still was.</p>
