        <p>THE Games are heading back to Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Now that thousands of  Olympians have made their way back to their home countries, approximately 4,000 Paralympians from around the world are making their way to Australia this week, including four from Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Paul Nitz, 31, of Avon is a quadriplegic who will compete in the 100-meter dash -- on the same track Marion Jones did when she collected  five track and field medals last month for the United States. And, Dana Albrycht, 22, of Canton could be Sydney's next swimming sensation -- in the same pool American backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg won three gold medals. But, Albrycht will be springing off the starting block and doing the butterfly kick with only one leg.</p>
        <p>Nitz, Albrycht, Ann Thompson, 31, of Simsbury, and Deborah Hearn, 39, of West Hartford are the four Connecticut athletes who will represent the United States at the 11th Summer Paralympic Games, which run from Oct. 18-29. The Paralympics are the disabled athlete's Olympics.</p>
        <p>They are held in the same Olympic host city for athletes who might need a wheelchair or prosthesis because of an amputation, spinal cord injury, or cerebral palsy. Blind and cognitively impaired athletes also compete.</p>
        <p>Because the Paralympics are timed to coincide with the staging of the Olympic Games every four years, the term Paralympic, to signify parallel Games, was developed. It is the world's second-largest sporting event, after the Olympics. Men and women from more than 130 countries will be competing in 18 different sports against athletes with similar disabilities. The United States is sending 256 athletes.</p>
        <p>The Paralympics are sometimes confused with the Special Olympic World Games, which are games for athletes with mental retardation.</p>
        <p>The Paralympics were founded in England in 1948 to help rehabilitate wheelchair-ridden veterans of World War II. They were held in a hospital to coincide with the 1948 London Games. And, in 1960, the first official Paralympics took place in Rome. In Seoul, Korea, the Paralympics were held at the same sites of the 1988 Games; the way it has been since.</p>
        <p>Winter and Summer Games are held, and athletes must qualify for the Games through a trials process.</p>
        <p>''It's just another cast that's coming down to Sydney,'' said Mitch Gross, public relations manager at Hartford Life Insurance Company, which sponsors Nitz and other athletes.</p>
        <p>Nitz is an insurance underwriter for the Hartford Life subsidiary of The Hartford Financial Services Group in Simsbury.</p>
        <p>Despite having to use a wheelchair or prosthesis, Nitz said, ''we're trying to show that our talents are on par with everyone else's.''</p>
        <p>Nitz has won three consecutive gold medals in the Paralympics in the 100-meter wheelchair race. His time of 17.62 seconds in the 100 at the 1996 Atlanta Games was a world record at the time and is still an American and Paralympics record. The world record has since been broken by Canada's Andre Beaudoin (17.01).</p>
        <p>Nitz, whose legs were paralyzed when nerves in his neck were damaged during his breech birth, never complained about his disability while growing up, said his father, Gunter Nitz by telephone from the family's home in Edina, Minn. ''I used to say that if Paul complained twice during one year it would surprise me,'' Gunter Nitz said.</p>
        <p>''He's just been an inspiration to myself like no other person,'' he added about his son, who is coached by Ann Thompson's husband, Brian Thompson.</p>
        <p>Albrycht, a swimmer, was also born with his disability. His femur, or thighbone, jutted out from his hip at a right angle. Surgeons amputated his leg above the knee and pointed his femur down. At 1, Albrycht was fitted with a prosthesis. It didn't stop him from playing soccer, baseball or basketball with other children. His doctor recommended swimming. There, he would build his upper body strength and let his arms make up for the power he lost from his missing leg. At 6, Albrycht started swimming competitively.</p>
        <p>Albrycht went on to wrestle for Canton High School and finished fifth in the state in his weight class during his senior year. He joined the University of Vermont varsity swim team and was the only disabled swimmer on the team.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact he never won a race, he co-captained the Vermont  swim team as a senior and won the team's Russell Sunderland Memorial Trophy, an award given by Vermont coaches and athletic administrators to the senior student who best exemplifies the qualities of character, leadership and persistence in overcoming obstacles throughout his college career.</p>
        <p>The United States Olympic Committee pays for the Paralympic athletes' air fares and uniforms. Several companies and individuals in Canton raised money to help Albrycht with expenses so that he could train full time. He practices six days a week with the Charter Oak Aquatic Club in West Hartford. He will compete in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle, the 200 individual medley, and the 100 butterfly in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Albrycht's highest finish in Atlanta was fourth in the 100 butterfly.</p>
        <p>Just qualifying for the Paralympics in Indianapolis in June wasn't easy for Albrycht. He finished in the 100 butterfly in 1 minute 6.33 seconds. Since the Atlanta Games, it was the fourth-best time in the world for swimmers in his disability classification and a personal best.</p>
        <p>After the Paralympics, Albrycht will complete his last semester at Vermont. He plans to become an elementary school teacher after graduation.</p>
        <p>Ann Thompson dreamed of being an Olympic skier while growing up in Bloomfield. Her family skied in Plymouth, Vt., on weekends, and Thompson made an all-boys' ski team when she was 8. She became one of the top junior skiers in the country and in 1985 at the age of 16, Thompson lost her balance while skiing down an icy mountain in Austria. She somersaulted and landed on her back, severing her spinal cord and losing the use of her legs.</p>
        <p>''When I came back to sports I just changed sports,'' Thompson said of her interest in the Paralympics.  ''I'm still a competitor. I had that mindset of how to train and what it took to get to the top.''</p>
        <p>Thompson said she has always wanted to represent her country. She has won five track and field medals at the past three Paralympics.</p>
        <p>At the 1996 Games, Thompson, watched the American women's wheelchair basketball team and thought that would be a fun group to join. This year she made the 12-member Paralympic squad.</p>
        <p>Thompson was on court when the United States won its last two international competitions. The last victory in August was sweetest of all because the United States became the first team in 10 years to defeat Canada in an international game.  The Americans came back from an 11-point deficit and won the first Roosevelt World Wheelchair Basketball Challenge for Women, 47-38, in overtime, in Warm Springs, Ga.</p>
        <p>The U.S. women's wheelchair team is ranked No. 2 in the world, behind Canada. Wheelchair basketball rules are similar to international basketball rules. Players can roll their wheels twice but must then dribble, pass or shoot. The basket is the same height as in an N.C.A.A. or Olympic game.</p>
        <p>Thompson, at 5 feet 5 inches, is one of the shortest women on the team. She's also one of the fastest.  She has won the Chicago Marathon seven times in the wheelchair division.</p>
        <p>Frank Brasile, the women's basketball coach, is expecting an exciting competition at these Games.</p>
        <p>''It's more exciting because it's a pure amateur sport,'' Brasile said. ''These athletes have to work hard to get where they go. They're out there representing their country, and the world could care less. They're doing it for pure love of the sport, and that's what's exciting.''</p>
        <p>Those with Internet access will be able to view that excitement and many of the Paralympics events live. Wemedia, an Internet company, will run 100 hours of the Paralympics on its site, www.wemedia.com.</p>
        <p>Thompson is the sports program manager at the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain. There, she coaches the Cruisers, the wheelchair basketball team for athletes from ages 5 to 18.</p>
        <p>As for Hearn, she will compete in the javelin in Sydney. Having been born with cerebral palsy and suffering from seizures since she was a girl, Hearn never dreamed she could play sports while growing up in South Windsor.</p>
        <p>''I felt odd in high school because of my disability,'' Hearn said. After graduating from high school, she began playing handball through the United Cerebral Palsy Association in Hartford. Her coach at the organization, Bill Wilkie, introduced her to the javelin. And, Hearn qualified for the 1992 Barcelona Games. But, she hurt her shoulder and didn't place.</p>
        <p>Hearn, who lives in West Hartford, hopes to do better in Sydney. She also said she is looking forward to seeing the kangaroos. ''And, it'll be a nice experience to get away from home for a while,'' she said.</p>
