        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Now That I Have Your Attention'' (Backslash, Oct. 8), in which Matt Richtel described his frustrating quest to find information about spammers -- the senders of unsolicited commercial e-mail messages:</p>
        <p>In the column, a provider of bulk e-mail software said that when someone uses the program to send unsolicited mail, the messages should include a way to decline future overtures.</p>
        <p>I have received several e-mail messages over the last few weeks that appear to get around that idea in one of two ways.</p>
        <p>The simplest is for the sender to claim that the message is part of a  ''one-time mailing''; the second is to instruct the recipient to send an e-mail response to a listed address and to write ''Remove'' in the subject line.</p>
        <p>The difficulty in dealing with the second approach, as you might expect, is that I have never been able to return messages to the ''removal'' address. Usually, I receive an error message that the user is unknown.</p>
        <p>I would rather receive a straightforward message that I can delete than one that encourages me to waste more of my time sending and receiving more mail.</p>
