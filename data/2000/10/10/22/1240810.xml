        <p>BOTH sexes can catch the second half of a four-day film festival by, for and about girls today and tomorrow at the Anthology Film Archives. The festival is titled ''Here's Looking at You, Kid!'' and is presented by the Lower East Side Girls Club. Short movies, features, documentaries and animated films deal with issues that girls face growing up, involving parents, school, boys, sports and society's views on beauty and ambition.</p>
        <p>Most of the films are aimed at children 11 to 18, though a shorts program titled ''It's Not Easy Being Me'' will take place today from 1  to 3 p.m. and is for children 8 and older. At 4 p.m. will be the New York premiere of ''Poetic License,'' a one-hour documentary by David Yanofsky about teenage poets who use poetry slams as emotional outlets. The screening will be followed by a live poetry slam featuring some of the young writers seen in the film.</p>
