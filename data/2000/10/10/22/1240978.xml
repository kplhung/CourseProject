        <p>Just weeks after Sotheby's Holdings settled its price-fixing case, the mutual fund manager Ron Baron, whose Baron Capital is this auction house's largest outside shareholder, was clearly in the mood to celebrate.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, Mr. Baron held his annual shareholder conference, which promised surprise musical entertainment. After sitting through speeches by chiefs of companies in the Baron portfolios, and a presentation by Mr. Baron himself, the investors and friends packing a ballroom at the Grand Hyatt in Manhattan heard him introduce Neil Diamond. ''I've been a fan of his since law school,'' Mr. Baron said.</p>
        <p>Anticipation of the musical guest probably swelled attendance; last year, the guest was Billy Joel. Some 2,300 shareholders showed up, a Baron spokesman said, 300 more than in 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diamond seemed amused at being asked to perform at an investor conference. He thanked Mr. Baron and his wife for inviting him. ''They don't have to go out and buy the CD;  they just buy the artist,'' he joked. ''We're going to have some mutual fun.''</p>
