An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger (+)indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders. Expanded rankings are available at The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/books. Best-seller lists for children's picture books, children's chapter books and children's paperbacks, respectively, are published in rotation on succeeding weeks; all three lists appear each week on the Book Review's Web site. Publishers have provided the age designations for their best-selling children's titles. Rankings for children's paperbacks do not include serials.</p>
