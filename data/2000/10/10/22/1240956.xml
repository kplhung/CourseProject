        <p>ARCHBISHOP ALEX BRUNETT entered the towering St. James cathedral in downtown Seattle and walked over to a baptismal font. ''The water isn't just sitting there,'' Archbishop Brunett said, gesturing to the small, clover- leaf-shaped pool where the holy water was circulated by a pump. ''We don't baptize people in stagnant water, but flowing water, water that is alive.''</p>
        <p>So vital is the concept of living water to Catholic theology, he says, that he and seven of his fellow Catholic bishops from Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia will soon release a Pastoral Letter that calls on Catholics and others to create a new environmental and spiritual awareness about the Columbia River watershed, the region's main waterway.</p>
        <p>Called ''The Columbia River Watershed: Realities and Possibilities'' the document came about, Catholic leaders said, because the river was in such dire straits from a century of unbridled logging, mining, grazing and dam building. About 16 million salmon once migrated from the Pacific each year to spawn in the tributaries along the 1,200 miles of the Columbia, a number that has dwindled to around 700,000.</p>
        <p>The eight bishops are collectively the leaders of 1.2 million Catholic parishioners spread over 260,000 square miles in the United States and Canada, and the region's largest single denomination. The letter has been five years in the making and is due to come out at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Although the letter stops short of an opinion on some of the river's most contentious issues, like tearing out dams, it does plow new theological ground, calling the river a ''sacramental commons.''</p>
        <p>''A sacrament is a moment of encounter with God,'' said John Hart, a professor of environmental science at Carroll University, a catholic school in Helena, Mont., and the author of the document. ''To say the river is a sacramental commons means people can experience the creator in creation, outside the formal church settings.''  The letter, which has been circulating in draft form, injects a new element into an extremely contentious battle in the Northwest. Environmentalists, Indian tribes, fishermen and others argue that salmon in the river could be lost if drastic measures aren't taken, including the removal of four dams along the lower Snake River to restore spawning habitat. Farmers, shippers and other business interests claims such actions will harm the region's economy. The Clinton administration recently decided against removal of the four dams.</p>
        <p>Many who work in resource extraction industries in the Northwest feel the letter has a liberal, anti-business slant. ''Corporate capital intensive operations and profit maximization practices, more than environmental laws, are costing timber-related jobs,'' the draft letter reads. In it the bishops vow to reduce the use of gold in church adornments -- an implicit criticism of the region's mining activities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hart has found himself the target of angry e-mail messages and phone calls from miners. One accused him of ''hiding behind the skirts of the bishop.'' Certainly, the bishops have not ducked the controversy they have created. Kirwin Werner is a Catholic who teaches science at the Salish Kootenai College in Montana. He attended one meeting at which a logger in opposition to the project harangued Bishop William Skylstad of Spokane, Wash., the chairman of the Pastoral Letter steering committee. ''Skylstad stood up to him,'' Werner said. ''And when he was done Skylstad told him, 'Well, times have changed.'''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are also unhappy, believing the church was co-opted by its conservatives, and so refused to call for the breaching of dams along the Columbia.</p>
        <p>STILL, the response to the letter from the many Catholics in the region has been mostly positive, said John Reid, a consultant in Seattle who is director of the pastoral letter project.  ''Seventy five percent are in favor of it and people are saying things like 'I am proud to be a Catholic' and 'My God, the Catholics are dealing with the real world,' '' said Mr. Reid. He also said that about 25 percent of Catholics were telling the Church, ''You've been co-opted by the eco-terrorists.''</p>
        <p>Tribal leaders seem particularly encouraged by the letter. ''Maybe God has spoken to them,'' joked Don Sampson, a Yakima Indian who is also executive director of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, a coalition of tribes that seeks to restore the salmon and a traditional way of life. ''I hope the pope gets on board.''</p>
        <p>More seriously, Mr. Sampson said: ''The church is being up front and dispelling the myth of Manifest Destiny and dominion over the Earth. That's refreshing and welcome. But I'd like to see them call for action rather than just reflect.''</p>
        <p>Will the concept of a sacred watershed be taken to heart by Catholics whose actions are degrading the river? It just may, said Jeremy Fivecrows, a Umatilla Indian and a public affairs specialist at the Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.y ''It's easy to marginalize Native American religion,'' Mr. Fivecrows said. ''It's a lot harder to marginalize your own religion.''</p>
        <p>While the Pope and American bishops have made strong statements about the environment in recent years, some wonder if the Catholics have really gotten religion on the matter. Though it is being promoted as an effort to reclaim a river, the Pastoral Letter may also be an effort by the Catholic Church not to go the way of the salmon.</p>
        <p>''The fact that the bishops are willing to do this is a significant development,'' said Dieter Hessel, director of the Program on Ecology, Justice and Faith, a nonprofit group in Princeton, N.J., that helps seminaries and university religion departments integrate ecology into their teaching. ''How it's followed up -- how rank-and-file Catholics respond -- is a real question.'''</p>
        <p>Some critics, inside and outside the church, say the whole exercise rings hollow since the church refuses to deal with what many consider to be the fundamental environmental problem: overpopulation.</p>
        <p>''It's not meant to resolve questions, but to point out the importance of this great river,'' said Archbishop Brunett. ''People say, 'Stay in church where you belong,' but that's not what we've been called to be. We're trying to establish a sacredness in the world around us.'''</p>
