        <p>Roosevelt Island has thousands of disabled residents, but on some days, they say, they feel isolated. The reason is that two of the island's few links with the outside world, the tram and the island's one subway station, are not always accessible to them.</p>
        <p>''The island isn't always compliant'' with the Americans With Disabilities Act, said Patrick Stewart, president of the Roosevelt Island Residents Association. That federal law requires public facilities to be wheelchair accessible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart said that escalators and elevators at the island's only subway station, which is on the B line, do not always work, and that subway doors open slightly above the platform, making it hard for the disabled to board. Buses do comply with the law, but they go to Queens only.</p>
        <p>''That leaves the tram,'' Mr. Stewart said. The elevator on the Manhattan side is small and old and often broken, he said, as is a backup elevator. He said that Community Board 8, of which he is a member, decided last month to get in touch with local officials to seek money for a new, larger elevator on the Manhattan side.</p>
        <p>''But first,'' he said, ''we have to find out who's got the money and where it is coming from.''</p>
