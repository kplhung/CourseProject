        <p>The Presidents Cup will conclude on Sunday, but much of the suspense ended today.</p>
        <p>With each point collected by a deep and talented United States team, the International team became more downcast. This was not drama. This was a drubbing. Already in command, the Americans won four of the five four-ball matches this afternoon, running away with the competition and moving to within 2 1/2 points of clinching the cup.</p>
        <p>For the Americans, it was a superb day of team golf. Stewart Cink and Kirk Triplett remained an undefeated tandem. Jim Furyk and Hal Sutton were brilliant, making birdies on nine of 13 holes during their romp to victory.</p>
        <p>But the nightmare continued for Ernie Els, the world's No. 2-ranked player, who has lost all four of his matches, a devastating blow for the International side.</p>
        <p>By the time dusk settled over Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, the final outcome had virtually been settled. The Americans held a 14-6 lead heading into Sunday's singles matches, needing just 16 1/2 points to regain the cup. Simply put, the International team needs a miracle. The Americans will have 12 matches to earn 2 1/2 points, and considering how well they have played, that may not take long.</p>
        <p>After today's play ended, the International players felt a myriad of negative emotions. They were stunned, they were embarrassed, they were baffled that so much could have gone so wrong. In 1998, the International team routed the United States, 20 1/2-11 1/2, so the foreign contingent entered this competition with high hopes. But the Americans, buoyed by the spirit generated from last year's comeback Ryder Cup victory, have dominated by making key putts and working together beautifully.</p>
        <p>''At the Ryder Cup last year, we learned what it was like to be a team again, maybe for the first time since high school sports,'' said Tom Lehman, who teamed with Phil Mickelson to win his match today.</p>
        <p>''Having lost a couple of Ryder Cups before that, we bonded together, and there has been some carry-over into this event. We've played some super golf.''</p>
        <p>How deep is the United States team? Tiger Woods is just 2-2 in his matches, yet the Americans are in command. Woods was part of the only losing American twosome today; he and Notah Begay III were defeated by Retief Goosen and Vijay Singh, 2 and 1. Every other match went the Americans' way.</p>
        <p>Sutton and Furyk romped over Greg Norman and Michael Campbell, 6 and 5. David Duval and Davis Love III beat Els and Nick Price, 3 and 2. Lehman and Mickelson defeated Mike Weir and Steve Elkington, 2 and 1. And in the day's closest match, Triplett and Cink defeated Robert Allenby and Carlos Franco, 1-up.</p>
        <p>As Price considered being 8 points behind, he wondered how his team would react tomorrow if the United States clinched the cup early.</p>
        <p>''Unless something drastic happens, tomorrow is going to be pretty boring for everyone,'' Price said. ''That's not what we wanted. We tried our guts out, but it didn't happen for us. It's going to be very difficult for all of us tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Asked for his view, the International team captain Peter Thomson said, ''We're not surrendering.''</p>
        <p>The United States has never fared worse than 6-6 in Presidents Cup singles matches. It would take a collapse of enormous proportions for the Americans to lose.</p>
        <p>Sunday's 12 singles matches will feature, in order, Paul Azinger against Allenby, Duval against Price, Loren Roberts against Stuart Appleby, Mickelson against Weir, Love against Els, Lehman against Elkington, Woods against Singh, Cink against Norman, Sutton against Franco, Furyk against Shigeki Maruyama, Triplett against Campbell, and Begay against Goosen.</p>
        <p>The International team can only hope that the later matches will still be of consequence. Today, Furyk and Sutton got the Americans off to a great start, and the momentum snowballed. Mickelson closed his victory on the par-4, 17th hole with a spectacular birdie, hitting a pinpoint wedge approach shot from 113 yards that nestled 3 feet from the pin.</p>
        <p>Shots like that came all day from the American side. Triplett and Cink, two Presidents Cup rookies, improved their match record to 3-0 by taking a 1-up lead after 13 holes, then holding off Allenby and Franco. The International team desperately needed that match, but Triplett continued his superb putting, while Cink's iron play was steady and strong.</p>
        <p>By building a 5-0 lead on the first day, and a 10-5 lead after Friday, the Americans have entered each day loose and confident, while the International team has been on the defensive.</p>
        <p>Woods has not been at his best, and it showed today when he missed a 5-foot putt at No. 16 that could have evened his match. But collectively, the Americans were far superior, and as a result, they stood on the verge of victory.</p>
