        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The competition among theater Web sites recalls a time when Earl Wilson, Franklin P. Adams, Ed Sullivan and others did joyous battle each day to land scoops on backstage developments [''Gossip! Divas! It's Theater On the Web'' by Jesse McKinley, Oct. 8]. And we're talking about real news reported by real journalists -- not just gossip and divas (though there's that, too).</p>
        <p>The worldwide nature of the Web enables theater Web sites to create a town square for far-flung theater communities. And theatergoers have strong opinions and love to share them. By its interactive nature, the Web provides a virtual Algonquin round table where anyone may sit and where anyone who dares can try being an electronic Dorothy Parker.</p>
        <p>The Web challenges the awesome power of some Broadway press agents, whose Stalinist control of information about shows is partly responsible for reducing news coverage of theater, particularly Broadway, to a comparatively safe (and dull) lub-dub of interview-review, interview-review. The Web sites have their own sources and get their own news their own way. This may cause the occasional gnashing of teeth and rending of garments in producers' offices. But overall it gives a sense of thrill and life to legitimate theater that helps far, far more than it hurts. A few of the press agents and producers are getting it: if so many people want to know so much so badly, something really interesting must be going on.</p>
        <p>Partly thanks to the Web, the focus is passing from the playwrights, songwriters and directors to the audience itself. After all, where does theater really occur? Not on the stage, but in the hearts of the audience members. Traditional journalism can't cover that. By encouraging give and take between readers and journalists every step of the way, the Web is the medium that can.</p>
