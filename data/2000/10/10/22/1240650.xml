        <p>I suggest that flight attendants commit Jeff MacGregor's name and his characterization of us as ''flying waitresses'' to memory. That way, should an emergency occur on one of his flights, the cabin crew would know to concentrate their efforts on saving the lives of those passengers who respect our jobs as safety professionals.</p>
        <p>A ''flying waitress'' would be capable only of serving him food or drink, which, in an emergency, he would not have the time to enjoy anyway!</p>
