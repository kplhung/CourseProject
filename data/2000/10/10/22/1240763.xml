        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In Herbert Muschamp's article on the state of design [''A Happy, Scary New Day for Design,'' Oct. 15], he writes as if design were mostly about the way things look. From objects to architecture, he views desirable design as design that pleases the eye and provides a launching pad for metaphorical flights. This time, it is the veil as a contemporary design motif. There is no consideration of how things work, not even with the PowerMac G4, that wonder of function. No, its design value is as a cube reminiscent of Bauhaus-influenced products, as an advertising image that embodies ''omnipotence and omniscience,'' as a ''rounded-off Platonic solid.'' As anything and everything except what it is: a new computer.</p>

        <p>When it comes to architecture, Mr. Muschamp's focus remains on beauty and symbol, not on function, nor on the body in architecture nor on architecture as a backdrop for daily life. Although he points out the limits of the aesthetics of design (''beauty can be a veil, an invitation to overlook the ugly that we implicitly accept by buying into the system''), he believes that his readers would get bored if he were to write about buildings from the standpoint of the environment, economics or politics. Not this reader. I think it would be most interesting. It might even suggest some of the reasons New York City has had so few memorable buildings constructed in the last generation, reasons that go beyond preservation, Mr. Muschamp's recent target of choice.</p>
