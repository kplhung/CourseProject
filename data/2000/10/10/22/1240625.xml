        <p>In the spiritual realm, one is told, there is no loss, just change.</p>
        <p>Over the past few years, Lee Radziwill has seen the deaths of her sister, Jacqueline Onassis, her nephew John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette. A few weeks after the crash that killed Kennedy and his wife, her son, Anthony Radziwill, died of cancer. There was more to come. Radziwill and her third husband, the film director Herbert Ross, separated.</p>
        <p>Radziwill moved to Paris, to an airy two-bedroom apartment in the 16th arrondissement with soothing views. Although she still maintains an apartment in Manhattan, the idea of Europe was inviting. From the late 1950's until 1964, Radziwill lived in England and frequently visited the Continent, as it was still worthily called, with Prince Radziwill, her second husband. After President Kennedy was assassinated, Radziwill and her children, Anthony and Christina, moved to New York to be closer to her sister.</p>
        <p>''There's a softness here that we do not find so easily at home,'' Radziwill says on a rainy afternoon in Paris. ''Everybody isn't in such a rush. The day starts later and ends later. And when you see some sun, Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. It brings tears to your eyes.''</p>
        <p>Radziwill has decorated her apartment, near the Bois de Boulogne, without fuss or finery. A fifth-century Roman head of a young boy that reminds her of her son, a drawing by Tiepolo, a simply framed photograph of her great niece Rose Schlossberg and two Art Deco giraffes are among the very few things she has brought from home. Like Karl Lagerfeld, who recently ended a long relationship with the 18th century -- I don't want to live as the curator in my own museum,'' he said -- Radziwill has furnished her Paris apartment in a minimalist style with pieces from Christian Liaigre. The kitchen table, which seats 24, is from Conran's.</p>
        <p>''I like to feel like I am floating, and I felt that here immediately,'' Radziwill explains. ''The moment I saw the light and openness, I felt peaceful.'' The apartment's lack of ''architecture,'' she says, ''made it apparent what I had to do.''</p>
        <p>First, the floor was stripped bare and not varnished or lacquered, so it would stay sandy. ''It made no sense, of course,'' she says. ''A raindrop would show on it, but never mind. Then, as I'm not planning to have grand gatherings, I shortened the living room so I could make my bedroom larger and have room for a desk.''</p>
        <p>At the desk, Radziwill is writing a memoir mostly about her personal style, titled ''Happy Times,'' illustrated with photographs from an informally organized archive. Assouline plans to publish it next year. It is Radziwill's second book. Her first, ''One Special Summer,'' with drawings by her sister, was published in 1974. Originally written when Radziwill was 18 and her sister 22, it was presented to their mother, Janet Auchincloss, to thank her for allowing the young women to travel, one special summer, in Europe.</p>
        <p>The book's cover shows a black-and-white photograph of the two of them. ''Look at us,'' Radziwill marvels, taking a copy off the shelf. ''How did those countries let us in? We look like two criminals arriving off the boat.''</p>
        <p>They don't.</p>
        <p>''You can see how much Jackie was influenced by Steinberg,'' she says, looking proudly at her sister's drawings. ''That summer was my first trip to Europe. Jackie was leading the way, as she had lived here for two years at the Sorbonne. That book was such fun. Filled with enthusiasm, but it was such an organized trip. We had to call our mother all the time.''</p>
        <p>When she returned to New York, the former Lee Bouvier met and married Michael Canfield, a publishing executive. The newlyweds lived in a small penthouse apartment on East 52nd Street. ''One of the reasons we all got married so young in those days was so we could have our own apartments,'' Radziwill recalls. ''Our families would never let us live alone. Of course, I decorated the apartment, but it was so small you could only get out of the bed on one side.''</p>
        <p>The Canfields later moved to London and eventually separated. Radziwill accepted a job in Brussels. For several months, she helped supervise Vogue's exhibition in the American Pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair.</p>
        <p>''Vogue put on these fashion shows for about 24 hours a day -- at least it felt like that. Every few weeks the looks changed. My job was to slave-drive those poor girls down a ramp wearing these American clothes.''</p>
        <p>In 1959, she married Prince Stanislas Radziwill, an exiled Polish nobleman, and returned to London, where her serious decorating began. ''Despite loving England, and loving English gardens, I'm not a chintz person, never was. It's too cute. I was looking for sensuality and anything that would remove you from the seriousness of where you were.''</p>
        <p>Radziwill had noticed a small photograph in a magazine of a sofa designed by Renzo Mongiardino, who had once told John Richardson: ''I am not a decorator. I'm a creator of ambience.'' Mark Hampton described Mongiardino as an ''alchemist.'' Indeed, some of Mongiardino's most inspired projects were the sets he created for his friend Franco Zeffirelli's films, like ''The Taming of the Shrew.'' Although Mongiardino decorated for a number of grand people with last names like Agnelli and Heinz, helping them to create backgrounds for their art collections, decorating for Radziwill allowed him to do some of his most creative residential work.</p>
        <p>For the Radziwills' small Georgian brick house near Buckingham Palace, Mongiardino designed an Orientalist fantasy living room paneled and bordered with block-printed Indian paisleys. The dining room walls were covered in faux Cordoba leather left over from a Zeffirelli opera production. For Turville Grange, the Radziwills' Queen Anne-style house near Henley, he completely reinvented the simple, not overly large country house.</p>
        <p>''The most wonderful room was the dining room,'' Radziwill says. ''On the walls, Mongiardino applied Sicilian scarves printed with flowers on a background of blue. Then, over the scarves, his friend Lila de Nobili painted more flowers and, in oval shapes, portraits of Christina and her favorite animals, which included a lot of birds, and for Anthony's portrait there were dogs and horses. It sounds cute, but it wasn't. It had lots of atmosphere. I don't like dining rooms. I think they have too much structure and are too formal. I thought this was magical. Lila de Nobili thought the room had a very Turgenev feeling.''</p>
        <p>Mongiardino died in 1998. Lila de Nobili now lives in Paris, where she ''teaches underprivileged children how to paint,'' Radziwill says. ''She's a wonderful, eccentric lady, not unlike my aunt who had millions of cats and lived very much as an original in East Hampton.''</p>
        <p>Known to the rest of us as the resident of Grey Gardens.</p>
        <p>Radziwill pauses. ''I'm afraid all this sounds frightfully grand and pretentious.''</p>
        <p>''But it was a different world then,'' I suggest.</p>
        <p>''It was. You know, it really was.''</p>
        <p>''It was the 1960's.''</p>
        <p>''And everything happened to me in the 1960's. But now it really is very nice to arrive at a time in one's life when you have no more need for acquisitions,'' Radziwill says. ''I have a great curiosity to see new things, but not to own them. It's very peaceful this way, and one of the nice things about getting older.''</p>
        <p>We sit in the library. Radziwill pours me a cup of coffee. Zoom, an enormously friendly golden retriever, rests at his mistress's feet. It is 4 in the afternoon. Radziwill drinks hot water from a white teacup.</p>
        <p>''Herbal teas never did it for me -- never helped my skin, or made me sleep,'' she says and smiles. ''I get cold easily. The water makes me feel warmer.''</p>
        <p>We look at a few of her photographs, including some of the rooms Mongiardino decorated. I ask if her taste was a response, or a reaction, to her mother's decorating.</p>
        <p>''My mother was very strict, and very old-fashioned, as ladies of her generation were. She would say things to Jackie and me like, 'You girls had better learn to play cards or you are going to grow up to be lonely old maids.''' Radziwill laughs. ''She had such classic taste. To me, it was boring to the point of being sterile. Every library, whether it was in New York or East Hampton, had chintz. The same decorator was called in on a biannual basis for slipcovers. Very nice, but bland. And I remember these philodendron plants in my childhood, looking at them, these poor depressing philodendron plants that never even seemed to need water, alas.''</p>
        <p>When she was 8, she spent her first summer at Hammersmith Farm, in Newport, R.I., owned by the Auchincloss family. Radziwill's mother had married Hugh Auchincloss. At Hammersmith, there were scarlet rugs indoors and magnificent vistas from the house to Narragansett Bay. The vast gardens were originally designed by Frederick Law Olmstead.</p>
        <p>''To arrive there, as a child of 8, was just a fairy tale,'' Radziwill says. ''It was good for my imagination. It was such a wonderful place. We rarely left. My sister and I didn't go in for beach life, or Bailey's Beach, the club. My stepfather wanted to create at least half of Hammersmith into a working farm. The first animals were named after my sister and me. Two Guernsey cows named Jacqueline and Caroline, which was my first name. Caroline Lee.''</p>
        <p>Among Radziwill's photographs is a black-and-white portrait of Janet Auchincloss wearing an elegant dress to the floor. ''Her style was either like this dress in the picture, which she wore every year for Christmas for something like 20 years and was so wonderful, or sports clothes. My mother was a remarkable rider.''</p>
        <p>Radziwill finds a story from an old Life magazine about her starring role in a Chicago stage production of ''The Philadelphia Story.'' Yves Saint Laurent designed six costumes for her to wear. ''I was anxious enough about everything,'' she recalls with amusement. ''I thought one less thing to worry about was what the costumes looked like.''</p>
        <p>The production was done in the round. ''No curtain to hide behind,'' Radziwill says. On opening night, she was so paralyzed with fear that she couldn't move her hand from left to right -- the play opened with a letter-writing scene. ''I guess it was insanity on my part,'' she says. ''I finished my acting career with a perfectly terrible TV show of 'Laura,' produced by David Susskind.</p>
        <p>''Oh, it was good training for life,'' she says, her lilting voice distinguished by certain fine old ''Noo Yawk'' tones. ''There's criticism that is constructive and criticism that is just mean. You learn from the constructive. You don't let the bad get to you.''</p>
        <p>Zoom, the faithful retriever, drools over the photograph of an ankle-length Saint Laurent wedding dress with pink lace flowers. Several years ago, the dress itself was given to the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum.</p>
        <p>Radziwill closes the magazine. ''What year was that?'' she asks, looking for the date on the cover. ''Nineteen sixty-seven -- 35 cents. Thirty-five cents! Zoom,'' she says, caressing the dog's brow, ''that wouldn't even buy us a biscuit for you today.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  An article in The Times Magazine last Sunday about Lee Radziwill misspelled the surname of the landscape architect who designed the gardens at Hammersmith Farm, a family home. He was Frederick Law Olmsted, not Olmstead.</p>
