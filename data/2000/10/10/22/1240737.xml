        <p>IT is the year of the men who  mean to be president and it is the year of multiple Macbeths. It doesn't take a Shakespearean maven to figure out the connections.</p>
        <p>But the Scottish play, as most theater folks feel it must be called, is the  all-time bad luck play. An evidently unbreakable line of what historians and some witnesses insist are not mere age-old superstitions, but real-life horror tales enshroud its very title; say it and you're doomed, especially if you say it in a dressing room.</p>
        <p>Worse, for the general theatergoer, a notorious series of truly rotten productions, many involving illustrious players, have cast a contemporary curse on Shakespeare's tragedy  of power and paranoia. And it doesn't help current and future productions that the Royal Shakespeare Company's acclaimed interpretation, with Antony Sher and Harriet Walter, produced as part of the International Festival of Arts and Ideas in New Haven in June, was the notable exception that momentarily broke the evil spell.</p>
        <p>That ''Macbeth'' is Shakespeare's shortest play may be arguable to  some directors, theater professionals and pundits, but uncommon wisdom and received belief has it that, line for line, it is. In one of the many  curious paradoxes hovering over an irresistibly challenging masterwork, it all too often seems to be one of the longest.</p>
        <p>Michael Wilson's own manic  ''Macbeth,'' his first Shakespeare at  Hartford Stage where he is artistic director, gets more of the long than the short of it. And an intermission too. The Scottish play -- of that, the bagpipes in John Gromada's percussive, out-of-control score remind us -- is usually performed without a break.</p>
        <p>In Hartford, it is not so much textually elongated as overstuffed with what one audience member referred to as pageantry. It could also be thought of as eye candy, though the banquet scene is showily theatrical  and, for finesse, the soldiers' tactical forward movement as Birnam Wood, gorgeously lit by Robert Wierzel, is the production's singular visual sensation.</p>
        <p>Of course, eclectic and timeless, in terms of period, are the most overused descriptions of Shakespeare on stage. One has grown accustomed to, if not weary of, voodoo kings, their jungle queens, and all manner of  resettings. Still, the also timeless ''imperial theme'' must transcend all trappings. Here it does not.</p>
        <p>For audience delectation, a porter, a short part apparently and usefully  expanded here, talks of politicians, polltakers, health insurers and an ''equivocator with lechery.'' In dual roles, Ken Grantham, also playing  the modern doctor, is so classically amusing that labored attempts at  relevance work through sheer style.</p>
        <p>But the commonly perceived notion of Macbeth as an ordinary guy is pursued to an extreme, in Denis O'Hare's ordinary performance.  Even his pathology is ordinary. Yes, we are supposed to recognize the  guile and the greed monsters in ourselves, but not so obviously, and Macbeth should, at least, hallucinate and  derail mightily. The actor's attempts  to indicate the mind's construction in his own face are less artful than labored.</p>
        <p>Lady Macbeth is lustily acted by Stephanie Roth-Haberle. Given a bluntly sexy partnership with her husband, there is every reason to address them as Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth.</p>
        <p>On her own sultry terms, she is a noirish siren and a 21st-century exemplar of attitude, outrageous and decadent. Most evocatively, the actress in drop-dead slinky gowns revels in the aphrodisiacal aspects of power and in replications of the dirty-dancing craze by Peter Pucci, the choreographer. And she enacts an effectively histrionic mad scene, with a little sleepwalking on the side. Never the fair and noble hostess, Ms.  Roth-Haberle is nevertheless the haughty yet inviting one.</p>
        <p>Jeff Cowie's scenic design, starting with a striking if familiar descending neon roof, provides the essential metaphor for all consuming  -- and consumer -- wastelands, not just political. But it's all been done,  undone and overdone before. For Mr. Wilson's next foray into Shakespeare, perhaps a little less fuss, a little more art.</p>
