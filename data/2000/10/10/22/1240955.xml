        <p>IN China, foreign journalists tend to take a dim view of the police, who keep track of where we live, hassle us over visas and occasionally shoo us away from demonstrations or people that seem newsworthy.</p>
        <p>So when the bumper of my car collided with the side of one of the city's ubiquitous  ''xiao gong gongs'' -- the ratty privately operated vans that serve as the city's shadowy cut-rate transportation system -- I was not inclined to call 112, the emergency number for the traffic police. The van's driver happily agreed: the police generally despise the xiao gong gong drivers, who ply the streets of Beijing with reckless abandon in search of fares.</p>
        <p>In fact, there are hundreds of fender-benders a day in the traffic bedlam of Beijing, and they are typically handled the way every transaction is settled in China: by bargaining. The two sides determine which side was responsible and try to settle on a fair price, generally paid on the spot. No police. No report. No paperwork. No insurance company. Quick results.</p>
        <p>So in the split seconds after I heard the sound of my headlight shattering I took stock: I had insurance to repair our company-owned car; the battered van almost certainly did not, but had suffered only a superficial (though long) scrape. I truly didn't know who was what percent responsible. The bus had darted over to the curbside to collect a passenger without signaling (I'm not even sure xiao gong gong's have signals). But perhaps I had pulled out of a driveway a tad too fast.</p>
        <p>As a scruffy-looking driver and conductor poured out of the van heading angrily for my door, I decided that the simplest course was to offer to pay for the repair in full. How much could touch-up paint cost? I'm terrible at bargaining and I was already late for an appointment. More important, our vehicles were stopped nose to tail, blocking the driveway of my children's school and, by local law, could not move an inch until financial responsibility for the damage had been accepted or assigned.</p>
        <p>In less than an hour, 12 busloads of my children's friends would need to pass through this driveway to go home. So I was willing to pay cash to get out of there.</p>
        <p>I opened the car door and began, ''Don't worry, I'll accept responsibility and pay for your repair.''</p>
        <p>''Free lunch!'' the duo's eyes gleamed. The conductor set out busily picking paint chips off every ancient dent of their tinny old vehicle, the driver whistled as we inspected the long black scratch and they insisted that the only way to fix it would be to replace the entire side of the van, for 2,500 yuan, about $300.  Now, I have no idea what car repairs actually cost in China, but that amount sounded high and I certainly didn't have that kind of money with me.</p>
        <p>So I called our office driver, who came to the crash site to mediate with 800 yuan, $100 -- the absolute maximum he said we should give them.</p>
        <p>In the meantime a small crowd of old Beijingers had gathered round our kissing vehicles, each one weighing in with a verdict. The people's court leaned heavily to my side, but still the opponents wouldn't lower their demands.</p>
        <p>Though the conductor bought us Cokes to show his goodwill, we could not reach detente: We had to call 112 for a policeman, and let the legal system play its hand.</p>
        <p>Twenty minutes later, a white Lada with sirens blaring pulled up next to the driveway, and a grumpy middle-aged traffic cop who'd clearly been pulled away from his tea and his nap emerged to check out the situation. Shaped like a refrigerator, with aviator sunglasses and a drab green Public Security uniform, he said little, but his body language told volumes.</p>
        <p>''Does she speak Chinese?'' he barked into the crowd, at no one in particular. ''Does she have a driver's license?''</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' I said as he lumbered off to check out the damage. He made one slow circle around my car and another around the little bus and came back to where we anxiously waited.</p>
        <p>''How come you couldn't solve this yourselves?'' he scolded. ''There's not much damage.''</p>
        <p>''We offered them 800 but they want 2,500 yuan,'' our office driver volunteered.</p>
        <p>''2,500 yuan?!?'' he snorted at the bus conductor, his voice dripping with disdain, steam practically roiling from his ears. ''You're just trying to cheat her cause she's a foreigner. Get out of here.''</p>
        <p>Then to me: ''You're willing to give him 800? It's too much. They probably won't even fix that scratch.''</p>
        <p>I shrugged.</p>
        <p>''Well then, take her money and run away,'' he said to the pair, who now had the sulky demeanor of schoolboys caught shoplifting. ''It's more than you deserve.''</p>
        <p>In a flash, my legal battle was over: I handed the conductor the small wad of bills. The policeman headed back to his tea and his car. I stood there dumbly for a minute, expecting at least a lecture, some questions, or form to fill out. ''I can go?'' I asked uncertainly. The policeman waved me away. It was done. In fact, as far as the public record goes, it never even happened.</p>
        <p>At first, I was elated as I maneuvered my car with the broken headlight out on to the road (giving very wide berth to other passing xiao gong gongs). In this country that has officially embraced the ''rule of law,'' justice had been meted out quickly and efficiently, and I had emerged vindicated, victorious.</p>
        <p>B UT as I drove back to work, my victory became tainted with misgivings and a bit of remorse: Who was this policeman -- my judge and jury -- and what did he really know about car repair or our accident anyway? He never asked us how we happened to connect, or if anyone else had witnessed the crash.</p>
        <p>He had to make a simple choice between siding with a polite foreigner offering to smooth over the situation with a bit of money, and a couple of poor scoundrels in a type of beat-up bus with a reputation for flouting traffic laws. It took him less than a minute to render his opinion.</p>
        <p>But xiao gong gongs are not the only vehicles in Beijing that wreak havoc on the roads. The streets are filled with government cars and military vehicles -- identifiable by their license plates -- that also disregard traffic lights and fly down bike lanes, knowing they will never be fined.</p>
        <p>What if, next time, my car brushes into one of these cars? Where will the rule of law fall then?</p>
