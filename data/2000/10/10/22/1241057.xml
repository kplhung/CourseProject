        <p>In his campaign for Senate, Representative Rick A. Lazio has portrayed himself as a can-do sort of politician: effective because he is part of the House Republican majority, but sufficiently independent to defy his party when New York's interests are at stake.</p>
        <p>''I think we need somebody in the majority party,'' Mr. Lazio said in a recent debate with his Democratic rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, ''who can work well with others, who can cross party lines, who can be independent, and who's got the ability to make sure that New York gets its fair share.''</p>

        <p>In his campaign for Senate, Representative Rick A. Lazio has portrayed himself as a can-do sort of politician: effective because he is part of the House Republican majority, but sufficiently independent to defy his party when New York's interests are at stake.</p>
        <p>''I think we need somebody in the majority party,'' Mr. Lazio said in a recent debate with his Democratic rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, ''who can work well with others, who can cross party lines, who can be independent, and who's got the ability to make sure that New York gets its fair share.''</p>
        <p>But it is a central paradox of Mr. Lazio's Senate campaign that the very thing that has helped make him effective in Congress has also restricted his freedom and independence: his closeness to the House Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>Since the Republicans captured control of the House in the 1994 elections, Mr. Lazio has been a deputy whip; over the past two years, he has also been an assistant majority leader. And while not in the stratosphere of Congressional power, Mr. Lazio is widely viewed as the most influential moderate in a leadership dominated by conservatives.</p>
        <p>The role has brought him many benefits. It has helped him win a seat on the powerful Commerce Committee, where he wields influence over numerous issues important to New York, including health care and telecommunications. It has enabled him to win passage of legislation that his leadership might otherwise have ignored, including measures to help breast cancer patients and the disabled that Mr. Lazio has featured prominently in his campaign.</p>
        <p>And his access to the House leaders has allowed him to work behind the scenes to moderate some of their harder-edged conservatism on issues like the minimum wage, the environment and funding for New York hospitals and museums, his allies contend.</p>
        <p>''There is not a doubt in my mind that his role in leadership makes him more effective,'' said Andy Ehrlich, Mr. Lazio's chief of staff. ''It gives him an entree.''</p>
        <p>In exchange for his seat at the table of power, Mr. Lazio has also had to give up something, his critics assert: the freedom to criticize his leaders openly and to vote against them whenever he chooses. That assertion lies at the heart of the Clinton campaign's attack on Mr. Lazio as a ''foot soldier of Newt Gingrich.'' And it has touched off a fierce debate over what Mr. Lazio's eight-year record in Congress says about his ideals and independence.</p>
        <p>Defining that record is like ''trying to screw Jell-O to the wall,'' one Democrat said. A frequent ally of environmental groups, Mr. Lazio supported provisions of the Contract With America that weakened environmental regulations. A self-described defender of abortion rights, he has repeatedly supported restrictions on the procedure. A proponent of better wages for low-income workers, he has voted to exempt hundreds of thousands of small businesses from paying the minimum wage to new employees. A supporter of the assault weapons ban and the Brady Bill requiring background checks for gun buyers, he voted to rescind a gun ban in the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his allies contend that his mixed votes reflect the swing nature of his Suffolk County district, which, though predominantly Republican, has voted for Democrats, including Bill Clinton, in the past.</p>
        <p>They also argue that his twists and turns are evidence of a thoughtful legislator who considers his votes carefully, puts his district first and isn't afraid of defying expectations. ''Life isn't simple, why should government be?'' Mr. Lazio once said.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton's allies have sought to cast Mr. Lazio's record as evidence of a finger-to-the-wind mentality, an eagerness to please the powerful and placate his party's conservatives.</p>
        <p>Regardless of his own centrist inclinations, Mrs. Clinton's allies contend, he has been a willing accomplice to policies that have hurt New York and defied the wishes of most of its voters.</p>
        <p>''Is Rick Lazio a right-wing member of the House?'' asked Representative Eliot L. Engel, a Democrat from the Bronx. ''I think he's not. But he has obviously supported leadership. And they are not Rockefeller Republicans. So he bears some responsibility for that.''</p>
        <p>A Place at the Table</p>
        <p>In the days immediately after the Republicans' stunning victory in the 1994 elections, Mr. Lazio, who had just won re-election to a second term, faced an important decision: whom to back in the heated fight for majority whip, the third-most-powerful position in the House?</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County native decided to recruit votes for a hard-charging conservative from Texas named Tom DeLay. The two were not close personally or philosophically, but Mr. Lazio viewed Mr. DeLay as an emerging powerhouse worth getting close to, a friend of Mr. Lazio said recently.</p>
        <p>''It was a way to get into leadership,'' said Alan Binder, who worked for Mr. DeLay in Washington and also served with Mr. Lazio on the Suffolk County Legislature. ''He knew a moderate should be at the table. And he thought, why shouldn't it be him?''</p>
        <p>Sure enough, Mr. DeLay won handily. And as a reward for Mr. Lazio's support, Mr. DeLay named him one of 13 deputy whips, in charge of counting votes among Northeastern Republicans.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, it was a role Mr. Lazio filled extremely well. In the early, heady days of the Contract With America, party unity was strong. But within months, more and more moderates began rebelling against the leadership's positions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, however, remained a discreet and dependable deputy, working closely with the leadership to keep its slim 25-seat majority from fraying while also supporting most elements of the contract.</p>
        <p>An aide to the current House leadership said Mr. Lazio is trusted because ''he's not a rabble-rouser. He won't run around trying to get people to change their votes.''</p>
        <p>Helping to cement his standing with the leadership, Mr. Lazio began raising money for the Republican Party and his colleagues. In 1996, he gave a modest $29,000 from his own campaign account to the National Republican Congressional Committee, records show. But in 1998, he gave $113,000 to the committee, more than all but one of his fellow deputy whips. And this year, Mr. Lazio served as a co-chairman of the largest fund-raiser of the year for Republican Congressional candidates, the House-Senate Dinner, which took in a record $11.5 million.</p>
        <p>But many Republicans say the real source of Mr. Lazio's influence has been his friendship with the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas.</p>
        <p>Aides say the two became close in 1996, when Mr. Lazio was a regular guest at dinners hosted by Mr. Armey to ease tensions between moderates and conservatives. Good-natured and quick with a smile or a joke, Mr. Lazio helped break the ice at those meetings. In a recent interview, Mr. Armey said he saw in Mr. Lazio a young, ambitious, telegenic legislator willing to bond with House leaders, despite ideological differences. He was also impressed by the cool, even-tempered way Mr. Lazio handled himself on television news programs.</p>
        <p>''I saw how his demeanor came across on TV and I thought this is a guy I can learn from,'' Mr. Armey said. ''I said, 'Rick, I want you to help me learn how to be charming and likable.' He said, 'First you got to back up 59 years and get born Italian and Irish.' ''</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Lazio proved his loyalty by recruiting moderates to support Mr. Armey during an effort by conservatives to oust him as majority leader following the 1998 elections.</p>
        <p>''The thing that tipped the scales in favor of Armey for me was Rick Lazio,'' said Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, a leading moderate Republican from Utica, N.Y. ''I knew moderates would have access to the majority leader.''</p>
        <p>As a reward, Mr. Armey created a new position for Mr. Lazio, assistant majority leader. Mr. Lazio also persuaded Mr. DeLay to keep him as a deputy, making him the only House member to serve on both leadership teams.</p>
        <p>Voting Against the Grain</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's allies say that his closeness to the Congressional leadership has helped him build an enviable record.</p>
        <p>This year, for instance, many Republicans say Mr. Lazio was instrumental in the passage of legislation providing $80 million a year to begin cleaning up Long Island Sound. Though other Republicans pushed for the measure, several credited Mr. Lazio for getting the leadership to bring it to the floor.</p>
        <p>''I tried to do it, and didn't succeed,'' said Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican. ''Maybe that means he's closer to leadership than I am.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, advocates for people with AIDS, arts funding and the environment say Mr. Lazio has been a valuable conduit to the Republican leadership. When, for instance, other Republicans were unwilling to fight a measure that would have rescinded restrictions on mountaintop mining, Mr. Lazio took up the cause at the behest of environmentalists and helped block it.</p>
        <p>''Of all the members of leadership, Rick Lazio was the one office that the environmental community could turn to to promote the alternative view,'' said Betsy Loyless, political director for the national League of Conservation Voters, which has endorsed Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>But his critics argue that Mr. Lazio's membership in the leadership club -- as well as his desire to appease powerful groups that are close to his leadership, like the National Rifle Association and the National Federation of Independent Businesses -- have caused him to cast votes that conflict with the sentiments of his district, and sometimes even with his own positions.</p>
        <p>Why else, the critics ask, would Mr. Lazio be one of just three New York Republicans to vote last year against a bipartisan bill that would have allowed people to sue their health maintenance organizations? The measure was considered popular in New York, and even two of his more conservative colleagues, Representative John E. Sweeney of Troy and Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of Clarence, voted for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ehrlich, the candidate's chief of staff, said Mr. Lazio opposed the bill because it would have allowed workers to sue their employers even when the employers were not responsible for health care decisions.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio's critics see a political motive: the House leadership wanted to defeat the bill, which was being promoted strongly by Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats, so that the Republicans could enact their own alternative in time for the 2000 elections.</p>
        <p>''He went with his leadership and, from a consumer, patient perspective, took a harmful position,'' said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a nonprofit organization for health care consumers.</p>
        <p>His leadership role might have also caused Mr. Lazio to cast what seemed like conflicting votes on the minimum wage in 1996, his critics say.</p>
        <p>That year, Mr. Lazio voted in favor of an amendment pushed by the House leadership that would have exempted hundreds of thousands of small businesses from having to pay either the minimum wage or overtime to new employees.</p>
        <p>After an unusually fierce floor fight, the amendment failed by just 33 votes. Mr. Lazio then joined 92 other Republicans in voting to approve a 90-cent increase in the minimum wage. In voting both ways on the issue, Mr. Lazio infuriated union officials, many of whom had considered him an ally.</p>
        <p>''His door was always open to us, he just didn't stand up for our issues,'' said Suzy Ballantyne, political director for the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Questions of Credit</p>
        <p>Some Democrats also argue that Mr. Lazio's closeness to the leadership has helped him gain credit for things on which other people did as much or more of the work. As an example, they cite the case of a recently enacted breast and cervical cancer bill that Mr. Lazio is now proudly citing in his campaign.</p>
        <p>The measure calls for federal financing of treatment for working-poor women who discover that they have breast or cervical cancer through federal screening programs. The treatment would be available to low-income women who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but also lack private health insurance.</p>
        <p>At the urging of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, Mr. Lazio introduced the bill in 1999 along with a California Democrat, Representative Ana G. Eshoo. They recruited more than 300 co-sponsors for the measure, but it languished for months in the Commerce Committee amid opposition from Republicans who said its price tag, more than $250 million over five years, was too steep.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Ms. Eshoo said Mr. Lazio had repeatedly refused to stand up to two powerful Republicans on the Commerce Committee who were blocking the bill: Representative Tom Bliley of Virginia, who wanted assurances the bill could be paid for, and Representative Tom A. Coburn of Oklahoma, who was pushing for a sexual abstinence amendment.</p>
        <p>She asserted that Mr. Lazio did begin pressuring the leadership to bring the bill to a floor vote this year -- but only after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York announced that he was suffering from prostate cancer in late April. Mr. Giuliani was at that time the Republican front-runner for the Senate seat being given up by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and the announcement revived Mr. Lazio's hopes of winning the nomination.</p>
        <p>Just a week after that announcement, the breast cancer bill was reintroduced, without Ms. Eshoo's name on it. And in days it passed, 421 to 1. ''When Giuliani was in the race, he could have cared less about it,'' she said of Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>The congressman's aides said Mr. Lazio had been working hard behind the scenes to promote the bill all along.</p>
        <p>''The breast and cervical treatment act is Rick's legislation,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio. ''He wrote it, he pushed it through.'' But advocates for breast cancer research said Ms. Eshoo deserved as much credit as Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Wearing a Perpetual Smile</p>
        <p>His critics and allies both agree that Mr. Lazio is one of the more genial and nonconfrontational members of Congress.</p>
        <p>''I don't know of anyone who Rick doesn't have a good relationship with,'' Mr. Boehlert said. ''He's got a perpetual smile. It's disarming.''</p>
        <p>But whether that style has made him a pragmatic team player or a malleable servant to his leadership, a consensus-minded moderate or a man without core values, is fodder for partisan arguments in the Senate race.</p>
        <p>''He's edgeless,'' said Tony Bullock, chief of staff to Senator Moynihan. ''His voting record reflects someone who is trying to be liked by all people.''</p>
        <p>The two sides both find supporting evidence for their views in the bruising 1998 fight over a measure to ban largely unregulated soft money that was strongly opposed by the House Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has portrayed himself on the stump as a champion of campaign finance reform in Congress. Yet during that 1998 fight, he declined to join other Republicans in signing a petition that would have forced the leadership to bring the bill to the floor, where it was sure to pass. Indeed, Mr. Lazio refused to state publicly where he stood on the bill until just before voting for it.</p>
        <p>To Democrats, Mr. Lazio's silence demonstrated once again an unwillingness to defy his leaders or to take strong stands on difficult issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shays, the Connecticut Republican who was the bill's chief sponsor, said Mr. Lazio was pushing the leadership to bring the measure to the floor -- in private. And he said he agreed with Mr. Lazio's decision not to sign the discharge petition, calling it ''an act of war'' that was too dangerous for a member of the leadership. ''He chooses his battles carefully,'' Mr. Shays said. ''People are trying to take a strength and make it a weakness.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the Congressional record of Representative Rick A. Lazio misstated the endorsements of the National League of Conservation Voters in the race for the United States Senate from New York. The organization has endorsed both him and Hillary Rodham Clinton, not just Mrs. Clinton. The New York League of Conservation Voters, a separate group, has endorsed only Mrs. Clinton.</p>
