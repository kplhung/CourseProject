        <p>PETER L. BERNSTEIN would be a wonderful dinner partner. He has an immense base of knowledge, from which he combs one good story after another. His tales are all rich with interesting characters and charmingly told. Though he has clearly done the scholarly reading, he would never bore you with minutiae. At the end of such an evening, you would understand that his stories all served his theme.</p>
        <p>Such it is with Mr. Bernstein's most recent book, ''The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, $27.95). This interesting and pleasurable work tracks the world's passion for gold from ancient Egypt to the present.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein is a Wall Street consultant with 60 years of experience in finance. He enjoys a reputation for explaining complex financial topics to a broad audience in an engaging way. He has written about the intellectual foundations of the capital markets and about probability theory in managing risk.</p>
        <p>This history is about the use and misuse of gold for money or -- in the modern era -- as backing for money, the arrangement known as the gold standard. Nations relied on gold to stabilize the value of paper money by standing ready to buy or sell gold at a set price. For a long time in the United States, that price was $35 an ounce. The gold standard is history now, as ancient as the Vietnam War: in 1971, President Richard M. Nixon ''closed the gold window,'' ending the right of foreign central banks to demand gold for dollars. Gold and the dollar are now worth whatever the financial markets say they are.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Bernstein is discerning and evenhanded in his writing, he shows his colors immediately. He begins with a story told a century ago by John Ruskin: A ship passenger has a big bag of gold coins. Later, when ordered to abandon ship, he straps the gold around his waist, leaps over the side, plunges to the ocean bottom and perishes. So, Ruskin asks, did he have the gold, or did the gold have him?</p>
        <p>The pleasure of the book is in its  sheer number of unknown places and interesting episodes. Mr. Bernstein introduces us to Offa, king of Mercia, who originated the first widely accepted money in Britain around the year 800. He retained three master moneyers, Eoba, Babba and Udd, to mint silver pennies by the millions, Cornwall being rich in silver. Offa's coin was in circulation for 500 years.</p>
        <p>The Chinese invented paper money. Marco Polo marveled at Kublai Khan's currency, ''as formal and authoritative as if it were made of pure gold and silver.'' The Great Khan had ordered every payment, anywhere in his domain, to be made in his currency. ''And,'' Marco Polo observed, ''no one dares refuse it, on pain of losing his life.'' Pretty good backing for a currency. Further, the Khan had ordered that treasure brought into his empire be turned over to him in exchange for paper money.</p>
        <p>Real treasure for mere paper -- was that unfair? How different was the Khan's fiat, Mr. Bernstein asks,  from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's action in 1933, barring private parties from owning gold and ordering gold turned in for dollars?</p>
        <p>There are sugarplums throughout the book. They might be a dazzling piece of prose by John Maynard Keynes, or a description of the logistics of the huge Spanish treasure convoys, or an aside on the relative economic advantages of camel caravans and ships in the gold trade between the Mediterranean and West Africa in the 15th century. Mr. Bernstein explains why, after centuries of coexistence, gold shoved aside silver as the universal standard. (Silver was swamped by a deluge of gold discoveries in the 19th century.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein suggests that a gold standard is a bane in bad times, an irrelevance in good. In hard times, protecting the gold stock requires high interest rates and austerity measures, deepening the downturn.  In good times, a strong economy itself supports the currency.</p>
        <p>Between the American Civil War and World War I, gold became the near-universal standard, ''a symbol of sound practice and a badge of honor and decency,'' said Joseph Schumpeter, the great economist. The era was known for prosperity and financial stability. But Mr. Bernstein sides with Benjamin Disraeli, who said in 1895, ''Our gold standard is not the cause but the consequence of our prosperity.''</p>
        <p>In a book with much fine narrative, Mr. Bernstein's treatment of gold policy between the world wars is exceptionally lucid. He calls it a horror story with no villains, only disastrous decisions prompted by an eagerness to get back to the comforting, pre-1914 ways. The British set a deadline of 1925 for restoring the gold standard, suspended during World War I. The campaign was led by the governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, an elegant, forbidding man who used his high office to great effect. He more or less browbeat Winston Churchill, then the chancellor of the exchequer, into approving restoration. ''I'm lost and reduced to groping,'' Churchill lamented among the high priests of money.</p>
        <p>Churchill grumbled that Norman could be perfectly happy if Britain had a fine credit rating and 1.25 million unemployed. Indeed, the British paid the price in higher interest rates, an economic slowdown, stifled imports and millions more people out of work. An improvement in exports -- the object of the game -- never materialized as trade dried up worldwide. Within six years, Britain dropped the gold standard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein sometimes condenses too much, leaving the reader dizzy. Writing about the great price revolution of the 16th century -- inflation that raged for a hundred years -- Mr. Bernstein notes that some scholars blamed the constant, costly warfare among Europe's kingdoms.</p>
        <p>Others, he writes, have focused on population growth that rapidly outpaced food production. (On the other hand, he says, still others have asked how people paid for the food. Mere need doesn't drive up prices.)</p>
        <p>The great Adam Smith squarely blamed the huge influx of gold and silver from America, which swelled the money supply without a corresponding increase in things to buy.  But Mr. Bernstein says that others exonerated that influx: inflation had taken off before bullion arrived in quantity and continued long after imports subsided.</p>
        <p>Rebutting the rebuttal, some objected that the fall in imports was overstated, because the customs figures left out smuggled goods. And finally -- finally! -- some insisted that everyone else had things upside down: the rapid rise in prices had prompted the avid search for gold and silver, not the other way around.</p>
        <p>Whew. My kingdom for a one-armed historian.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, though, with one illustration after another, ''The Power of Gold'' amounts to extensive, sophisticated and engrossing variations on the theme of King Midas, who was granted his wish that everything he touched would turn to gold. Midas was shortly in despair when his food, his belongings, even his daughter, were transformed at his touch. Mr. Bernstein believes that throughout history, people have clung to their gold and drowned.</p>
        <p>''Gold as an end in itself is meaningless,''' he writes. ''Hoarding does not create wealth. Gold and its surrogates make sense only as a means to an end: to beautify, to adorn, to exchange for what we need and really want.''</p>
        <p>Early in the book, Mr. Bernstein writes about peoples of West Africa who lived great distances from sources of salt. They developed a trade with Europeans, in which they swapped gold for salt, an ounce of gold for an ounce of salt. Mr. Bernstein wonders what the Africans must have thought of the Europeans, who were willing to trade this precious, life-giving commodity -- salt -- for a useless yellow metal.</p>
        <p>BOOK VALUE  Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  The Book Value column last Sunday, about ''The Power of Gold,'' by Peter L. Bernstein, misstated the year of a statement attributed to Benjamin Disraeli about the gold standard used in Britain. It was 1873, not 1895.</p>
        <p>The column also omitted part of the quotation. Disraeli said, ''Our gold standard is not the cause but the consequence of our commercial prosperity.''</p>
