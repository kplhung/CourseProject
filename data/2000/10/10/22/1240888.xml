        <p>Wood Workers Toy is a small store in Mount Kisco that offers wooden toys from around the world, including some made by local craftsmen. The owner, Hiro Hirano, said he sells ''the kinds of things you won't find at Toys ''R'' Us and Kmart.'' But now you can find Mr. Hirano's toys on the Internet.</p>
        <p>He said he made an early attempt at e-commerce two years ago, but only drew five orders. He relaunched his Web sites, www.woodentoys.com and www.classicwoodentoys.com, several months ago, promoting them more aggressively. He said Internet business now represents more than 5 percent of his sales.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirano has lived in Mount Kisco for 15 years. He said he formerly worked in advertising. Someday, he said, he'd  like to turn over retail operations to others so he can spend his time making toys himself.</p>
