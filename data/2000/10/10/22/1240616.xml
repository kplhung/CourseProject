        <p>BLIND AMBITIONS</p>
        <p>By Lolita Files.</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, $23.</p>
        <p>Desi Sheridan, the heroine of Lolita Files's third novel, is a struggling 34-year-old African-American actress who's about to throw in the towel and take a job as a personal shopper. Then the phone rings. No, it's not Publisher's Clearing House, but it might as well be: an Emmy Award-winning writer who owns his own production company wants her to star in a new television series. He and his partners will even throw in a $100,000 signing bonus. (It's not spoiling the suspense to report that Desi takes the gig.) Although Files loads her plot with personal intrigue and corporate backstabbing, ''Blind Ambitions'' is so keen to reward the good and punish the bad that there's little room for surprises. With all the machinations, there's barely space for the kind of freshly observed detail that made ''Scenes from a Sistah,'' Files's first novel, so much fun to read. Even more troubling for what aspires to be juicy commercial fiction, the author doesn't seem to know her way around: we are asked to believe that Desi, who has lived in Los Angeles for eight years and has appeared in 28 movies, needs to be told what a ''show runner'' is. (Doesn't she have friends who work in TV? Doesn't she read the trades?) Files shows the difficulties facing black talent in Hollywood, she creates likable women characters, and her engaging narrative style makes this an easy book to finish. But it's just as easy to forget.</p>
