        <p>When Gabe Paul, the longtime baseball executive, left the Yankees after the 1977 World Series championship season to become part owner and operator of the Cleveland Indians, George Steinbrenner gave him a less than gracious send-off.</p>
        <p>''He was in baseball for 40 years, 25 as a general manager, and did he ever win a pennant before?'' Steinbrenner said. ''You think he made all those moves with this team himself? You think all of a sudden he got brilliant?''</p>

        <p>When Gabe Paul, the longtime baseball executive, left the Yankees after the 1977 World Series championship season to become part owner and operator of the Cleveland Indians, George Steinbrenner gave him a less than gracious send-off.</p>
        <p>''He was in baseball for 40 years, 25 as a general manager, and did he ever win a pennant before?'' Steinbrenner said. ''You think he made all those moves with this team himself? You think all of a sudden he got brilliant?''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner's remarks about Paul are recalled at the start of the New York, New York World Series because they could be applied to present circumstances.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre is given universal credit for the Yankees' success in recent seasons, and he indeed deserves credit for leading the team to more World Series championships than any other team has won in any four-year period in the last quarter century.</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine is given credit for managing the Mets to their only successive postseason appearances and to the World Series, and indeed he deserves recognition for his efforts.</p>
        <p>''A lot is said about how guys don't like playing for Bobby,'' said a major league scout who followed the Mets recently. ''That club busted their butt every night they went on the field. That's a tribute to the professional people they are. They were ready to play. That's the manager's job and he did his job.''</p>
        <p>But Valentine never got anywhere close to this stage in his eight seasons with the Texas Rangers, just as Torre was a losing manager over all in his 14 years in that role before he landed the job of a lifetime with the Yankees. Their journeys to this phase of their careers need some perspective.</p>
        <p>When Sparky Anderson managed the Detroit Tigers, any time the front office added a talented player, he would say, ''I just got a lot smarter.''</p>
        <p>Torre got a lot smarter when he was hired to manage the wealthiest team in the major leagues, and Valentine got a lot smarter when the Mets owners faced reality and started spending money to try to keep up with the Joneses in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>When the Mets hired Valentine in 1996, they had a $25 million payroll. A year earlier it was $13 million, lowest among the major leagues' 28 teams. This season it was just shy of $82 million. Could Valentine have won the National League pennant with a $13 million payroll?</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips acquired the players Valentine used to win the pennant. The owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, authorized the salaries Phillips used to lure players like Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura, Todd Zeile and Al Leiter. Phillips made the trades that brought Mike Hampton and Armando Benitez as well as Piazza and Leiter initially.</p>
        <p>These Mets are as much, if not more, Phillips's team as they are Valentine's.</p>
        <p>The Yankees hired Torre weeks after they had returned to the postseason for the first time in 14 years. Gene Michael, as general manager during Steinbrenner's suspension, laid the groundwork for the construction of these three-time champions. Bob Watson continued the process. Brian Cashman has refined and bolstered the structure. And Steinbrenner's money funded the operation.</p>
        <p>Don Zimmer, Torre's bench coach and alter ego, was waxing poetic the day before the World Series began. He talked about how Torre kept the club going, filling in ''little pieces here and there.''</p>
        <p>Except it was Cashman who acquired David Justice, Glenallen Hill, Jose Vizcaino, Luis Polonia, Luis Sojo, Jose Canseco and Denny Neagle. It was Steinbrenner who said sure, raise the payroll to an embarrassing $112 million; if we can't beat 'em with the guys we have, we'll import another platoon.</p>
        <p>Zimmer talked about the injuries that struck the Yankees this season. Go talk to the Cleveland Indians about injuries. Zimmer talked about losing Ramiro Mendoza, the versatile pitcher. The Indians lost nearly an entire starting rotation. They would have loved to have replaced their injured pitchers with a new, healthy rotation. They did not have Steinbrenner's money.</p>
        <p>Ask any of 26 other managers, and they would give almost anything to have the rosters and reinforcements Torre and Valentine have been given. (Don't ask Davey Johnson, the departed Los Angeles Dodgers' manager, or Mike Hargrove of the Baltimore Orioles; in recent seasons their owners have spent lavishly but unwisely.)</p>
        <p>The true test for Torre and Valentine would have been to see if they could have managed the Oakland Athletics and the Chicago White Sox to the postseason, as Art Howe and Jerry Manuel did. It's not likely that they would have done any better, if as well, with teams paying their players $32 million and $37 million.</p>
        <p>The outcome of this Series may hinge on a move or two or three that one manager makes that is better than the other's. But the moves will not succeed without the players they have been given.</p>
        <p>''What makes Joe Torre such a good manager?'' Zimmer said, repeating a question from fans.</p>
        <p>''Good players,'' he said he has told them.</p>
        <p>The same goes for Valentine.</p>
        <p>General Managers Are Fans</p>
        <p>Lest anyone think people who run teams outside of New York are bored by this New York, New York World Series, a collection of general managers hereby testifies to the contrary.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't miss it,'' Gord Ash of Toronto said. ''Since I was 5 years old, the last time it happened, I think it's a wonderful thing. It's unique. Canadians don't share the anti-New Yorkism like the rest of the United States does. Toronto, specifically, and Canadians, as a whole, have an appreciation for New York.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's exciting,'' said Doug Melvin of Texas, a former Yankees employee. ''I'm taking my children. It's a little bit of history. You don't know when this might take place again.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Towers of the San Diego Padres said this World Series will be great for baseball. ''You've got two great ball clubs going head-to-head,'' he said. ''Superstars like Piazza and Jeter are on both sides. Regardless if you're from the Midwest or the West Coast, this is going to be a Series people look forward to watching.''</p>
        <p>Gerry Hunsicker worked as the Mets' assistant general manager before going to the Astros as general manager. ''I think it will provide a unique perspective on the game for the people across the country,'' he said, ''give them an opportunity to see what happens when two New York teams square off, which if you haven't lived in New York or been a part of it, you can't appreciate or comprehend. I can't think of a better stage for the Fall Classic.''</p>
        <p>Berra's Artistic Cow to Be Auctioned</p>
        <p>While Yogi Berra will be watching a possible Game 5 of the World Series Thursday night, Moogi Berra will be on the auction block.</p>
        <p>Yes, it's the Yogi cow from the summer Cow Parade that will go to the highest bidder at the Pleasantdale Chateau in West Orange, N.J. Moogi Berra is dressed in a Yankees' pinstripe uniform and catcher's mask. Most of the current team members and some former players have autographed the fiberglass cow.</p>
        <p>Because the auction conflicts with the  Series game, absentee bids will be accepted. Maybe Yogi will call in a bid from Shea Stadium.</p>
