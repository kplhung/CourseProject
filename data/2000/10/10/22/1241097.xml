        <p>Re ''New Advice for Parents: Saying 'That's Great!' May Not Be'' (news article, Oct. 18):</p>
        <p>At age 32, I still think to myself:  ''My parents and teachers routinely said I was intelligent, so why can't I understand more quickly? Why can't I act more decisively? Why aren't I making more money?''</p>
        <p>I agree that elders should not always give direct praise for a child's successes, but should instead express a lively interest or note the child's hard work.</p>
        <p>Children should learn how to praise themselves, because parents and teachers aren't around forever.  JASON ROSENFELD  Brooklyn, Oct. 18, 2000</p>
