        <p>To the Editor: My wife and I just completed a two-week trip to South Korea. I found security lapses at Kimpo Airport in Seoul troubling, however. On a Korean Air domestic flight from Seoul to Cheju Island, one person was able to obtain boarding passes for our group of four adults. At no time were any of us asked for identification.</p>
        <p>I checked two bags but was not asked for my passport or any other form of identification. I found this surprising in a country that appears to be so security conscious -- where else do you see armed guards on the approaches to bridges at major river crossings in the capital city?</p>
        <p>ROBERT ATKINS  McGaheysville, Va.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Korean Air responds: Since the change in government several years ago, added measures have been taken by the government to increase security at all airports. At domestic airports, procedures to guard against terrorism and other threats include X-ray screening of checked baggage and security screening of all passengers and their carry-on baggage by walk-through metal detectors and X-ray machines at main departure gates. Korean Air's policy is to check the identification of all passengers for international flights.</p>
        <p>In the near future, the line plans to ask the government to implement passenger identification for domestic flights.</p>
