        <p>After years of discussion over whether Westchester should build another public golf course, the Board of Legislators voted last week to appropriate $7 million for construction of an 18-hole course in New Castle in the northern part of the county, on 170 acres of land formerly owned by I.B.M.</p>
        <p>Richard Wishnie, a Democratic legislator who supported the plan, said that ''Westchester has 450,000 unaddressed rounds of golf annually; for years, the demand has far outstripped the supply.''</p>

        <p>After years of discussion over whether Westchester should build another public golf course, the Board of Legislators voted last week to appropriate $7 million for construction of an 18-hole course in New Castle in the northern part of the county, on 170 acres of land formerly owned by I.B.M.</p>
        <p>Richard Wishnie, a Democratic legislator who supported the plan, said that ''Westchester has 450,000 unaddressed rounds of golf annually; for years, the demand has far outstripped the supply.''</p>
        <p>The county has five courses, Saxon Woods and Maple Moor in White Plains, Mohansic in Yorktown and Dunwoodie and Sprain Lake in Yonkers. Some legislators preferred using the money to improve the existing courses. ''But those courses are 60 to 70 years old,'' said Larry Swartz, an adviser to the county executive. ''They weren't meant to be played as hard as they are. The new course will be able to handle 45,000 rounds annually, instead of 18,000 to 23,000 rounds at most public courses.''</p>
        <p>Greens fees at the new course are expected to be higher than the $20 a round charged at county courses on the weekend. The property, on Route 134 and Pines Bridge Road, was once the Hudson Hills golf club. I.B.M. bought it for offices but abandoned the plan and sold it to the county for $3.6 million in 1997. Construction is expected to take two years.</p>
