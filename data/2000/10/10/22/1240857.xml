        <p>One of music's most commercially successful mavericks, Moby -- a disk jockey, composer, producer and engineer -- uses his eclectic background to create provocative techno music. He integrates jazz, punk, soundtrack music and clever breakbeats into a highly stylized mix. His 1999 release ''Play,'' a blend of funky hip-hop and traditional folk and blues, was hailed by many critics as the year's best album. He recently released a greatest hits album, ''Mobysongs: 1993-1998.'' Don't expect him to be standing behind a turntable -- this guy is all over the stage, as he is all over the musical spectrum. Rare in the world of Backstreet Boys and ex-Mousketeers, Moby is an iconoclastic innovator. He will perform on Thursday at the Hunka Bunka Ballroom in Sayreville.</p>
