        <p>IN a borough of $4,000-a-month studios and private-school girls flinging Fendi baguettes around like, well, loaves of French bread, you can hardly blame Mercedes-Benz Manhattan for imagining that its cheeky new print advertisement would arouse little more than sophisticated smiles.</p>
        <p>The full-page ad, which appeared in this newspaper on Oct. 12, is dominated by a head-and-shoulders photograph of three dewy teenage models, their perfect faces nestled together like roses in a vase, their expressions vacant yet laden with expectation.</p>

        <p>IN a borough of $4,000-a-month studios and private-school girls flinging Fendi baguettes around like, well, loaves of French bread, you can hardly blame Mercedes-Benz Manhattan for imagining that its cheeky new print advertisement would arouse little more than sophisticated smiles.</p>
        <p>The full-page ad, which appeared in this newspaper on Oct. 12, is dominated by a head-and-shoulders photograph of three dewy teenage models, their perfect faces nestled together like roses in a vase, their expressions vacant yet laden with expectation.</p>
        <p>''If their Daddies could buy them CLKs,'' the tag line reads, ''so could yours.'' The message, in case anyone missed it, was hammered home in tiny type at the bottom of the page: ''At Mercedes-Benz Manhattan, your Daddy will be surprised at how affordable a new or pre-owned CLK can be, and how easy it would be for him to prove that you're still your Daddy's little girl.''</p>
        <p>But the ad didn't produce the public wink-and-smile the dealership had hoped for. Instead, it has created a cultural uproar. ''We thought it was funny,'' said Laurin Mayer, the marketing executive who approved the ad, which was created by Lipman, Richmond, Greene, ''but it turns out we may have been in the minority.'' (It was also approved at the national corporate level.)</p>
        <p>Within hours, the phone lines and modems were jammed at the dealership. Complaints came from women worried about the message the car company was sending to their teenage daughters and from men who didn't appreciate being portrayed as buying their daughters affection with pricey gifts. A group of students at New York University started an outraged e-mail campaign, railing against the retrograde stereotype of the pampered Daddy's Girl.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mayer stopped picking up the phone for three days. She couldn't stand being screamed at when she put her ear to the receiver. ''I can't tell you how many people called to tell me I was a moron,'' she said. ''Certain people said they would never buy a Mercedes again.''</p>
        <p>Within a day, the company decided to pull the ad, which had been scheduled to run several more times. Ms. Mayer and her staff were flummoxed: how could an ad with no nudity, no profanity and no violence produce such a response? ''It's not like we were doing heroin chic or kiddie porn,'' said David Lipman, the creative director of the agency that created the ad. ''I just don't get it.''</p>
        <p>But some experts say Mercedes-Benz Manhattan, which has showrooms at 536 West 41st Street and Park Avenue at 56th Street, stumbled across an invisible line that divides conspicuous consumption from dangerous overindulgence. The ad may have been intended as tongue-in-cheek, but it has cut too close to the bone.</p>
        <p>The mere thought of a Manhattan high schooler with a luxury car seems to have sown fear up and down the landscaped lane divider on Park Avenue. It probably didn't help that the models are dead ringers for a certain type of young socialite known to dance topless on nightclub tables and drive private school headmistresses to distraction.</p>
        <p>''People clearly think that there is a difference between consuming luxury and aggressively flaunting your consumption of it,'' said David Brooks, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard and the author of ''Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There'' (Simon &amp; Schuster). ''Even if you are obsessed with it, you have to send signals that you're not. And buying a Mercedes for your already overindulged daughter definitely isn't sending that signal.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone call from London, where he is shooting a Burberry campaign, Mr. Lipman dismissed such thinking as wrongheaded. He said he got the inspiration for the ad from two personal experiences last year. First, his 5-year-old daughter asked him if she could have a Mercedes someday. ''It just knocked me out,'' he said. Then, while he was having lunch at Cipriani's Downtown in SoHo, three young girls drove by in a CLK. ''I thought it was just terrific,'' he said. ''Isn't that what life's about, giving your kids all that you can, showering them with love, making them feel special?''</p>
        <p>The passion to convey that message was what guided him to cast those particular models. ''They had a twinkle in their eye that says, 'I'm better than anyone else,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>But to some critics, that twinkle is open to some dicey misinterpretations. Despite the girls' ages, the ad's sexual imagery is hardly subtle. In an era when wealthy men regularly marry women half their age and fashion magazines are full of 17-year-olds made up to look 25, who can tell if the ''Daddies'' referred to are biological or ''sugar?''</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure what's creepier -- the eroticizing of young girls or the commoditization of the father-daughter relationship,'' said Susan Douglas, the author of ''Where the Girls Are'' (Times Books, 1995), a cultural history of women's images in the news and entertainment media.</p>
        <p>To Jerry Della Femina, the advertising executive and restaurateur, the ad is remarkable more for the breadth of its bad taste. ''It's offensive on so many levels and to so many people,'' he marveled. ''You alienate the men who buy Mercedeses, their wives and any girl with a brain in her head.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Mayer countered that the ad must be understood in context.</p>
        <p>It is part of a series intended to broaden the car maker's appeal beyond its core customer base of middle-aged men, she explained. It was designed especially for the Manhattan market, she added, where adventurous advertising is usually applauded, and luxurious excess generally raises no more eyebrows than a $15 green salad.</p>
        <p>Earlier ads in the series included a mother and daughter (''If my mother can drive a pre-owned SL, so can  yours'') and an elderly woman (''If she can drive an SLK, so can you''). None of the other ads provoked any negative feedback, Ms. Mayer said.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Daddy's Girl ad had run several times in another publication, Time Out New York, with ''not a single complaint,'' Ms. Mayer said. The magazine's audience ''thought it was really amusing,'' she added.</p>
        <p>But after the criticism that the ad drew from readers of The New York Times, she said, the dealership has decided not to run it in Time Out again, either. And it has canned the final ad in the series, which was to feature two handsome young men (with copy along the lines of ''If they can come above 14th Street . . .'').</p>
        <p>''We just don't think we can take any more controversy right now,'' Ms. Mayer said.</p>
        <p>Some wealthy fathers agree with Ms. Mayer that the furor over the Daddy's Girl ad is overblown. ''You can't blame Mercedes for all the ills of the world,'' said Michael Bloomberg, the financial news executive, who has daughters ages 17 (Pathfinder) and 21 (Jeep). ''You may as well throw Prada and Gucci in there.''</p>
        <p>Besides, Mr. Bloomberg said, Mercedes's bad timing may have sunk the ad even without the public outcry. ''With the markets like they've been, you're going to see a lot less of this kind of stuff,'' he said. ''It's one thing when you're in the midst of a bull market, but now the temper of the times is changing.''</p>
