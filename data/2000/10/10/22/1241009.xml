        <p>When the powerful bomb that rocked the soaring twin towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan in February 1993 turned out to be the work of militant Muslims, Americans were spectacularly shown that their home soil was not immune to lethal reverberations of the Middle East conflicts.</p>
        <p>Later, federal officials said the bombing, which killed 6 people and injured more than 1,000, was part of a larger terrorist conspiracy that also included plans to bomb the United Nations headquarters and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.</p>
        <p>They said the conspiracy's leader was a blind, fiery fundamentalist cleric from Egypt, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who had immigrated to the United States in 1990. In 1995, a jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan convicted him of seditious conspiracy, rejecting his defense that he had only been continuing his longtime exhortations in America for the Egyptian government's overthrow. He was sentenced to life in prison.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Abdel Rahman, 62, is in a federal prison hospital in Rochester, Minn., under highly restrictive conditions, one of his lawyers, Abdeen Jabara, said. He said Mr. Abdel Rahman was kept isolated from the other prisoners and permitted to make no phone calls except to his lawyers and one 15-minute call a month to his family in Egypt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jabara said that only immediate relatives were allowed to visit, and because of the expense they had come to the United States for this purpose just once, when his client's wife and brother stayed for two weeks last year. He said that Mr. Abdel Rahman, unable to read or write because of his blindness, ''listens to a lot of tapes of Koranic exegesis and recitation.''</p>
        <p>A Federal Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman, Traci Billingsley, said she could not discuss any inmate's confinement details.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jabara's portrait of his client contrasted sharply with a Reuters news agency report two weeks ago that said an Islamic group in London reported receiving a statement, relayed though Mr. Abdel Rahman's ''legal advisers,'' in which he urged Muslims to ''kill Jews everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jabara said that the report was ''totally ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''It's not true any legal advisers transmitted such a message.''</p>
        <p>Forest Hills Stadium Seeks a Return Serve</p>
        <p>It stands in an affluent Queens neighborhood, a 15,000-seat stadium bathed in big-time tennis lore but no longer the terrain of top-rank play.</p>
        <p>Since 1978, when the United States Open left the West Side Tennis Club's stadium in Forest Hills for larger space in Flushing Meadows, the club has sought other big-draw uses for its legendary arena, where giants like Bill Tilden, Althea Gibson and Billie Jean King showed what world-class tennis was all about.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's the Forest Hills stadium held a Tournament of Champions, which attracted top players, but folded in 1990. A series of daylong concerts ended last year after noise and crowds angered neighbors, and heavy fines were levied for excessive noise and liquor-license violations.</p>
        <p>But the club, whose members rejected a 1998 proposal to raze the stadium, has not given up on top-notch tennis, its president, Jaggi Anand, says.</p>
        <p>''We made a bid to get a major tennis tournament, but did not succeed this year,'' he said. ''We'll give it a try next year.'' One hope, he said, was for something ''just before the U.S. Open, like a tuneup tournament'' that would include some of the Open-bound.</p>
