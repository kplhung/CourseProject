        <p>One of the most husbanded resources in any campaign is time. In a campaign as close and important as this year's presidential race, the candidates' daily schedules are negotiated only after countless arguments and untold hours of polling analysis.</p>
        <p>That is why some strategists in Vice President Al Gore's campaign struggle to understand why their candidate has spent part of many Saturdays this fall, including yesterday, off the trail. The answer is simple: Quakers football.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is a devoted fan of the Sidwell Friends Quakers (5 and 2), the private Washington high school team on which his only son, Albert III, is the co-captain. Despite his grueling campaign schedule, Mr. Gore has attended all seven of the team's games this fall, home and away, and plans to take in the final two, including one 72 hours before Election Day.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he flew from New Orleans to Washington for Sidwell's 41-40 homecoming victory over Stone Bridge before heading to Philadelphia for an evening speech. The previous Saturday, he rushed home from a morning rally in Detroit to watch the Quakers clinch a conference title with a 34-13 victory over Potomac School.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 12, he flew to Washington from Milwaukee to play host for the team's weekly spaghetti supper, this one at the vice president's official residence. Highlight films were shown. That was the day of the attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and Mr. Gore first stopped by the White House for briefings and meetings. But he still made the dinner.</p>
        <p>''We're all really impressed that he does it with all the other things he has going on,'' said John A. Simon, the Sidwell Friends coach.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore's aides may be befuddled from a purely political standpoint, they find his devotion to his children's extracurricular activities to be one of his most endearing traits.</p>
        <p>Throughout his tenure as vice president, days have been blocked out on his calendar for his daughters' lacrosse and soccer games and their first days at college. ''They're pretty inviolate,'' one Gore aide said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore declined to be interviewed for this article. But friends have speculated that one reason for his dedication is a stinging memory: his late father, Senator Albert Gore Sr., never managed to make it to Mr. Gore's high school football games. And Mr. Gore has frequently spoken about how he shifted his priorities and rededicated himself to his family after his son was hit by a car in 1989.</p>
        <p>''He's just devoted to his children, and it means a lot to him to be able to attend,'' said Frank W. Hunger, Mr. Gore's brother-in-law. ''Not only is he showing his support for Albert, but it's relaxation for him. He enjoys the games, knows all the players and their numbers.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, summoned the courage to suggest to his candidate that he might want to skip the next game. Mr. Gore was planning to fly from Detroit to Washington and then back to St. Louis for debate preparation.</p>
        <p>''I knew I was dabbling in a subject that was dangerous,'' Mr. Daley said. ''In my gut, I knew the answer to the question before I asked it.''</p>
        <p>Albert, who turned 18 on Thursday, is a versatile player whom Mr. Simon uses on offense as a tight end, center and occasional fullback, on defense as a linebacker and tackle, and as a punter. At 6-foot-2 and 240 pounds, he is the team's strongest player and can bench-press 245 pounds, Mr. Simon said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is not always reticent about putting his family on political display. He has spoken in convention speeches of his son's accident and his sister's death from cancer. He took Albert to climb Mount Rainier last year, and then used film of the trip in a campaign advertisement. But Mr. Gore has studiously avoided public discussion of Albert's football games, and his public schedules never mention them.</p>
        <p>Sometimes politics intrudes. In the Oct. 7 game at Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pa., several opposing players taunted the Quakers by wearing wrist tape with ''Bush-Cheney'' in black ink.</p>
        <p>''We shouldn't have given them anything more to get fired up for the game,'' reflected Andy Schroer, the coach of the Mercersburg Blue Storm, which won anyway. ''But sometimes you can't talk to kids.''</p>
        <p>Students and parents at Sidwell  Friends, which is Chelsea Clinton's  alma mater, are accustomed to seeing Washington celebrities and their Secret Service details in the stands.</p>
        <p>It can be a different matter at away games, like the one at Mercersburg, where autograph seekers hounded Mr. Gore at halftime. The home team's announcer did not help much. ''If you want to debate fiscal policy,'' he broadcast, ''there's a man in the visitors' bleachers.''</p>
