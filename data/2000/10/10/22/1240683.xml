        <p>FIVE years ago, in midcareer, Ralph Lemon disbanded his dance company. After a decade of successful choreographing and touring, he and his dancers decided that the strain of keeping the troupe together was no longer offset by the aesthetic rewards. So the dancers went their ways, and Mr. Lemon went enthusiastically into freefall.</p>
        <p>Concerned about the way technology had been reconfiguring American art, he set out to look at alternative practices in other parts of the world; he wanted to see how his own artmaking -- as dancer, writer, photographer and graphic artist -- would evolve if he played by different rules. Soon he became involved in a web of people and projects that could be easily modified to accommodate his agile and curiously moral imagination.</p>
        <p>One such project is ''Geography,'' a monumental trilogy Mr. Lemon has been working on for several years. The second part of it, ''Tree,'' will conclude a national tour next week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (on Tuesday and Thursday through Saturday) as part of the Next Wave Festival. Mr. Lemon describes ''Geography'' as a crosscultural experiment, and through it, he says, he is reaching beyond the specialized arena of pure dance to a more global, multidisciplinary experience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemon has always been a risk-taking, intuitive artist, one who reads Greek tragedy, Franz Fanon and Lao Tsu. He is a 48-year-old black choreographer who has never fit the militant, identity-obsessed black-choreographer stereotype. He is a dancer who says: ''There's nothing like the immediacy and the temporalness of dance as an art form. And yet, I feel that it's communicating less and less.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemon grew up in Cincinnati and Minneapolis. His life, like his dance experience, has occupied a cultural border zone. Relatives on his mother's side, whom he describes as ''off-white,'' often passed for white, and it wasn't until the family moved from its ''quietly segregated'' black neighborhood in Cincinnati, he says, that he heard racial slurs for the first time. When they visited his mother's family in South Carolina, he drank out of the Whites Only fountain because, he says, ''those words didn't mean anything to me.''</p>
        <p>He got a B.A. degree in English from the University of Minnesota and studied with Nancy Hauser, an inheritor of the German Expressionist line of modern dance brought to America by Hanya Holm. Mr. Lemon was drawn to postmodern dance when the stars of the avant-garde began appearing at the Walker Art Center during the 1970's. Stunned and impressed by the total-theater work of Meredith Monk, he made his way to New York and appeared in Ms. Monk's ''Recent Ruins,'' as well as her film ''Ellis Island.'' Before starting his own company in 1985, he had never danced in a conventional modern dance troupe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemon's choreography was an intriguing, sometimes baffling hybrid, combining the objectivity and formal but nonsequential patterns of postmodern dance with the expressive references and personalized movement that still identified him as a modern dancer. He was quickly recognized as a major artist, though one who couldn't be easily classified.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemon embarked on the crosscultural ''Geography'' project with an open-ended, improvisational curiosity that became the working strategy for the piece. He first tried out his idea on Sam Miller, executive director of the New England Foundation for the Arts. As director of Jacob's Pillow dance festival, Mr. Miller had commissioned several of Mr. Lemon's dances, and he admired the choreographer's working process.</p>
        <p>''When he was in the studio, he was really doing research,'' Mr. Miller said. ''He was working deeply, and I knew that he deserved the kind of laboratory his creative process implied.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller sent Mr. Lemon to see Stan Wojewodski Jr., director of the Yale Repertory Theater and dean of the Yale Drama School. On the train up to New Haven, Mr. Lemon scribbled a plan -- more of a wish list, actually -- and when the two men met, they hit it off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemon wasn't proposing any ordinary artist-academy romance. He wanted to travel abroad, assemble a group of performers and bring them to America to make a dance-performance piece. Eventually, the scheme involved three phases and was intended to spread over six years. What Yale provided was one of the most generous workshop and residency environments ever for dancers, with technical support and a three-week stage run for each installment.</p>
        <p>As a downtown Manhattan choreographer, Mr. Lemon had never been preoccupied with race. He and other African-American postmodern dancers worked largely outside the black dance establishment. But as the performance environment became more politicized in the 1990's, he began to wonder what relationship his formal dance-making bore to the long-buried traditions of African culture. He thought of Africa as a foreign place, and yet it was there that he felt he might find an insight -- an ''almost inscrutable sense of purpose,'' he said -- that his postmodernism lacked.</p>
        <p>He had visited the Caribbean, and now, to begin ''Geography,'' he went to Africa almost as a tourist, looking and recording his impressions. As he journeyed, he invited selected artists to join the workshops at Yale; eventually he collected six male dancers from the Ivory Coast, one Guinean living in the United States and one African-American. The ''Oresteia'' of Aeschylus provided a working text, but the Greek iconography became  buried under layers of shared dancing, drumming and gender play. After three months of workshops at Yale, the first installment of ''Geography'' -- now subtitled ''Africa/Race'' -- had its premiere at Yale Repertory Theater, in October 1997.</p>
        <p>Part 2, ''Tree,'' went through a similar gestation, with a premiere at Yale last spring. This installment has an Asian focus. Among the 12 cast members are seven Asians: Bijaya Barik and Manuranjan Pradhan from India, Asakao Takami from Japan, Wang Liliang and Li Wenyi from rural China, Wen Hui from Beijing, and Cheng-Chieh Yu, a Taiwanese who lives in New York. There are also four African-Americans -- Mr. Lemon, Carlos Funn, Yeko Ladzekpo-Cole and David Thomson -- and one dancer from the Ivory Coast, Djedje Djedje Gervais. (Along with Mr. Funn, Mr. Gervais also danced in Part 1 of the trilogy.)</p>
        <p>AS Mr. Lemon discovered, however, to classify the dancers by their national origins alone is to blur deep differences among them. They represent transnational lifestyles and training; Ms. Takami, for instance, is a longtime student of Guru Pradhan's Odissi-style classical Indian dancing. At the same time, their cultural traditions range widely, from remote village music and dance to complex West African drumming techniques to American modern dance and improvisation practices.</p>
        <p>''Tree'' turned out to be a work about crossovers and communication as much as an inquiry into cultural and social conventions. The stage work is a dense collage that accumulates meaning as its diverse elements recur and echo each other, transformed, over the 90-minute span of the piece. Several stories are told in several languages. People dance their own dances to other people's music. They do each other's dances. They fight, they accommodate. Perhaps their determination to keep trying to reach one another can protect them from the things they can't control, like the forces of nature. Nari Ward's set, a wall of wooden compartments and a curtain of heavy plastic strips, suggests that even solid, manmade materials can be permeable, can topple. But the storytelling goes on.</p>
        <p>(Related aspects of ''Geography'' can be seen on a Web site -- www/bam.org/tree -- opened recently by the Brooklyn Academy's New Media Project, and in a show of sketches, video and photography at the Margaret Bodell Gallery in the East Village, Oct. 24 through Nov. 5. ''Geography: art/race/exile,'' Mr. Lemon's travel diaries and workshop notes from part one, has just been published by Wesleyan University Press.)</p>
        <p>When I saw ''Tree'' at Yale last May, I was intensely aware of individuals, each standing out from the others, even when two or three episodes were going on at one time. Often there were counterpoint ensembles in which pairs of dancers wove among one another performing different movements. Just once, near the beginning of the piece, all the performers gathered in a unison dance, to which everyone had contributed movement ideas. Despite their clashing cultures, despite interruptions, broken trains of thought, conflicts of intention, one sensed a constant tilt toward community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemon says he found the African installment of ''Geography'' thrilling but difficult. He's struck now by the unexpected disparity in temperament, learning and performing styles between himself and that cast. The performers in ''Tree'' are more balanced. There are women, and several people share Mr. Lemon's contemporary dance background. He realized, he said, how much more comfortable he felt in that ''subdued, quiet, refined structure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemon's point of departure for the concluding part will be the American South, but whether Yale will participate will remain unresolved until a successor is chosen for Mr. Wojewodski, whose 10-year appointment ends in the spring.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, ''Geography'' keeps evolving even as it's being performed, and so does Mr. Lemon himself. ''I wanted to get past my own power as choreographer,'' he said. His role was often to bring together the varied traditions and skills of the performers. ''The beauty of this from the beginning,'' he said,  ''is that no one was anywhere near understanding what it is I do and what it was we were eventually going to do. There's a form of equality in the strangeness of it.''</p>
