        <p>Q.  We have a 71-year-old Tudor house in Great Neck, N.Y., with an original tile roof that rarely gave us any trouble. However, after a recent storm caused a major leak into the living room, we were told that the problem was the valley alongside the chimney and that the bill for repairing it would be $5,400. The finished job has left an uncovered sheet of copper about 3 1/2 by 12 feet behind the chimney. The roofer says that he cannot cover this with tiles because putting nails into the copper sheeting could cause leaks. We fail to see anything that looks like this on similar homes in our area. Is this the proper way to repair these roofs? . . . Gerald P. Mirrer.</p>
        <p>A. Joseph C. Jenkins, a slate-roof contractor in Grove City, Pa., who is author of ''The Slate Roof Bible'' ($35, Jenkins Publishing, Grove City, 1997), said that since every chimney and roof configuration is different, every chimney reflashing job will be different.</p>

        <p>Q.  We have a 71-year-old Tudor house in Great Neck, N.Y., with an original tile roof that rarely gave us any trouble. However, after a recent storm caused a major leak into the living room, we were told that the problem was the valley alongside the chimney and that the bill for repairing it would be $5,400. The finished job has left an uncovered sheet of copper about 3 1/2 by 12 feet behind the chimney. The roofer says that he cannot cover this with tiles because putting nails into the copper sheeting could cause leaks. We fail to see anything that looks like this on similar homes in our area. Is this the proper way to repair these roofs? . . . Gerald P. Mirrer.</p>
        <p>A. Joseph C. Jenkins, a slate-roof contractor in Grove City, Pa., who is author of ''The Slate Roof Bible'' ($35, Jenkins Publishing, Grove City, 1997), said that since every chimney and roof configuration is different, every chimney reflashing job will be different.</p>
        <p>''It is not uncommon to reflash a roof obstacle such as a large chimney differently from the way it was originally flashed,'' Mr. Jenkins said.  ''Sometimes the new flashing job will show more of the metal and sometimes it will show less.''</p>
        <p>He said, for example, that if the original chimney configuration caused water damming -- which only began to leak after many years of service -- then it would probably make sense to redesign the drainage around the chimney, thereby avoiding a similar problem in the future.</p>
        <p>''The contractor may have chosen to leave more exposed copper around the chimney because copper drains water more quickly than tile,'' he said. ''And the contractor is correct in explaining that it is unwise to nail through the flashing.''</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Jenkins said, the big question is, does the roof still leak? ''Of course it should not,'' he said. ''And although the copper is shiny and noticeable now, it will dull down to a dark brown in a couple of weeks and then eventually oxidize into a pleasant green.''</p>
        <p>Interest Rate on A Security Deposit</p>
        <p>Q. Every year I ask my landlord to pay me the interest on my security deposit. This year I noticed that the check was for 40 percent of the prior year -- less than half a percent in interest on my deposit. I inquired about this and discovered that my security deposit was put into a different bank paying a lower rate of interest. The landlord said this was done because he had a business relationship with the new bank that required him to keep balances there. It seems that this is highly unethical. Do I have any recourse? . . . Dale A. La Shomb, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A. John D'Agostino, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that the state's General Obligations Law requires owners of buildings with six or more residential rental units to deposit tenants' security deposits in an interest-bearing account in a New York bank that is paying an interest rate at the prevailing rate for similar deposits in other banks in the area.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. D'Agostino said, if the interest rate being paid on the letter writer's security deposit is less than the prevailing rate for similar deposits in banks in the area, the tenant would probably be entitled to receive whatever the prevailing rate is.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, it would be up to the letter writer to prove that the rate he is receiving is less than the prevailing rate, and then to determine whether the amount would be worth pursuing in the courts.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, most banks don't pay all that much interest on these kinds of accounts to begin with,'' Mr. D'Agostino said, adding that it would not be unusual for the interest on such an account to be 2 percent or less. Moreover, he said, whatever the interest rate is, the landlord is allowed by law to deduct 1 percent of the amount on deposit as an administrative fee.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Agostino added that it is not unusual for a bank that is doing business with a building owner -- when refinancing an existing mortgage, for example -- to require the owner to place all the building's accounts in that bank.</p>
