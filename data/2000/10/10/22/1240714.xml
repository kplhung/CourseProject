        <p>WE found ourselves recently in the Garden Room of the White Hart Inn in Salisbury. It is a great time of year to visit this northwest corner of the state , when the fall foliage is at its most spectacular.</p>
        <p>Foliage was the secondary reason for our visit. We knew the venerable inn had been sold and the new management team was in place, so we wanted to check out the food. There are actually three dining rooms at the White Hart, but the most formal one, the Riga Room, is open only for Friday and Saturday dinner, with a different menu and prices (entrees from $19 to $27). We decided to scope out the Garden Room and the adjacent Tap Room, which share the same menu, prices and casual ambience, saving the Riga Room for later visits.</p>

        <p>WE found ourselves recently in the Garden Room of the White Hart Inn in Salisbury. It is a great time of year to visit this northwest corner of the state , when the fall foliage is at its most spectacular.</p>
        <p>Foliage was the secondary reason for our visit. We knew the venerable inn had been sold and the new management team was in place, so we wanted to check out the food. There are actually three dining rooms at the White Hart, but the most formal one, the Riga Room, is open only for Friday and Saturday dinner, with a different menu and prices (entrees from $19 to $27). We decided to scope out the Garden Room and the adjacent Tap Room, which share the same menu, prices and casual ambience, saving the Riga Room for later visits.</p>
        <p>One change we noted from other visits was the addition of a fireplace at the end wall of the airy and open Garden Room, with its ficus tree and other greenery. The crackling fire helped enormously in taking the chill off the room at dinner, though we enjoyed the high-ceilinged light and airiness of the room at breakfast and lunch. On the other hand, the wood paneling and floor, fireplace and cozy alcoves of the Tap Room (a local hangout) are very toasty in winter.</p>
        <p>We feared the casual tone meant salads and sandwiches, but the short menu has a number of diverse choices.</p>
        <p>One dinner began with several intriguing starters, the prize of which was spicy shrimp, artichoke and tomato spread, delicious on olive bread bruschetta. French Brie baked in a snug wrapper of flaky, nicely browned puff pastry, came with chunky apple-pear compote, swirls of balsamic essence and two pieces of toast (superfluous).</p>
        <p>House-baked flat bread, surrounding a huge amount of creamy spinach and artichoke dip, would work better at a cocktail party. There was too much of it, too much sameness, to eat as an appetizer. Another letdown was the soup of the day, in this instance chicken creole, with so much superimposed spiciness it made us choke.</p>
        <p>As an entree, the Atlantic salmon filet, grilled with whole grain mustard and caramelized red onions, was moist and full of flavor, one of the better renderings of this almost-too-popular, too-often-served fish. The salmon rested on a pillow of creamy saffron risotto, accompanied by fresh asparagus.</p>
        <p>The kitchen also did well by swordfish, which was moist and pleasing, in an anise-accented beurre blanc, and came with light basmati rice and asparagus. An order of sundried tomato ravioli suffered from overcooking; its Alfredo cream sauce with Parmesan breadcrumbs was flecked with stripes of marinara sauce and blackened dots that may have been pesto, but were too far gone to recognize. Seared venison medallion, with mashed potatoes and a vegetable stew, was dense and tough.</p>
        <p>Servings in the Garden Room are generous. An attractive salad of greens, radicchio and diced tomatoes with a Dijon vinaigrette was served gratis, along with a basketful of house-baked cornbread and commercial-tasting rolls.</p>
        <p>We were happily surprised by several of the desserts, especially an unusual round lemon cheesecake (light and fluffy, refreshingly tangy) with a glazed top, in a raspberry coulis, served with a crispy ginger-coconut tuile. A mixed (fresh) berry cobbler in creme anglaise and gobs of whipped cream was also winning. A classic creme brulee was served with two excellent, house-made biscotti studded with pistachios. Only a mundane pumpkin pie in a leaden crust was a letdown.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two cost $62.80, before tax, gratuity or drinks. The thoughtfully-chosen, well-priced wine list is mostly from the West Coast, with a few wines from France, Italy and elsewhere. We had an enjoyable Alsatian Pinot Blanc, Cuvee Les Amours, Hugel '96/97 at $21, followed by a '94 Chateau Fontmarty Pomerol at $32.</p>
