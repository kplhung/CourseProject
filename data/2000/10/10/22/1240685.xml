        <p>AS a song topic, travel may place second in popularity only to love. So when the New York Festival of Song, bastion of imaginative thematic programming, gave a mixed bill of ''Songs of Travel'' last February, the singers had an embarrassment of riches to choose from. Among the surprises the Austrian baritone Wolfgang Holzmair came up with was Ernst Krenek's cycle ''Reisebuch aus den Osterreichischen Alpen'' (''Travel Album From the Austrian Alps'') of 1929.</p>
        <p>Not that he sang it all. The work's 20 songs run a full hour; like Schubert's ''Winterreise,'' supreme among musical travelogues, the ''Reisebuch'' amounts to a program in itself. Sad to say, Mr. Holzmair's first-rate recording with the pianist Gerard Wyss, on the Philips label, appears to be unobtainable in the United States. But from the stage, the singer announced that he would return before the year was out to present the ''Reisebuch'' in its entirety.</p>
        <p>Soon, in free recitals presented by the Austrian Cultural Institute at the Austrian Embassy in Washington on Oct. 30 and at Weill Recital Hall in New York on Nov. 2, in partnership with the pianist Russell Ryan, he will deliver on that promise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holzmair's performances are neither the first nor the last entry in a modest flurry of live events (some embarrassingly amateurish) and record releases occasioned by the centennial of Krenek's birth. But they may well have the most lasting repercussions. Not only is the ''Reisebuch'' a masterpiece and Mr. Holzmair its ideal interpreter. It is also a masterpiece from a world we still live in: the world of cars and golf and global conflict and tourists and postcards and identity crisis. Never mind that our ''high-speed trains'' are faster than Krenek's. Seventy years on, his sensibility still feels contemporary. To wander among Schubert's brooks, mills and quaint villages, we don period costume, as it were, and travel back in time. With Krenek, we can just walk out the front door.</p>
        <p>Born in Vienna in 1900, Krenek appears in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians as an ''American composer of Austrian birth,'' a label as unassailable in fact as it is misleading in essence. For the Nazis, Krenek came under the heading ''Kulturbolschewist,'' and his flight to America in 1938 was in no sense voluntary. Though he promptly established himself as a teacher, took American citizenship in 1945 and died in Palm Springs, Calif., in 1991, he lived his last five decades less as an emigre than as a spiritual refugee. But unlike others in similar circumstances, he did not fall silent. Indeed, New Grove calls him ''one of the most prolific composers of his generation.''</p>
        <p>In opera as well as symphonic and chamber music, he also proved among the most contradictory, adopting or discarding the musical styles of his century with uncanny fluency and ease. His opera ''Jonny Spielt Auf'' (''Jonny Strikes Up,'' as in ''strikes up a tune''), which brought him fame and fortune at the early age of 26, told its racy tale in a lush verismo idiom scandalously spiked with jazz. From its premiere in Leipzig, Germany, in 1927, ''Jonny'' sped to more than 100 cities, where it was heard in 18 languages. In 1993, a complete recording on Decca/London, since deleted, revealed a score that ranks high for melody, originality and invention. (An older, vocally superior CD of excerpts, featuring Evelyn Lear, Lucia Popp and Thomas Stewart, remains available on Vanguard.)</p>
        <p>Only seven years after ''Jonny,'' the Vienna State Opera embarked on Krenek's ''Karl V,'' a gloomy meditation on the death of Emperor Charles V, exemplifying the intellectually fashionable, never popular 12-tone technique introduced by Schoenberg. For political reasons, the project aborted, leaving it to Prague to mount the premiere in 1938. A concert performance at the Salzburg Festival in 1980, newly released on the Orfeo label, documents an austere, gripping score at the farthest remove from ''Jonny.'' A mesmerizing passage of the ''music of eternity'' in the opera's finale, an allegorical tour de force, underscores the voice of the dying emperor and the voices of four singing clocks with cosmic ticking in the orchestra, conjuring up the texture of time itself with an immediacy probably unequaled until Louis Andriessen's majestic ''Tijd'' (''Time'') more than 40 years later.</p>
        <p>Between the landmarks of ''Jonny'' and ''Karl V,'' but closer to ''Jonny,'' lies the ''Reisebuch,'' abounding unabashedly in good old-fashioned major and minor triads. The trip that inspired it took place in 1928. The 20 songs were written in 20 days (give or take) the following summer. The texts, like the librettos of the operas, are Krenek's own.</p>
        <p>One of the ''Reisebuch'' songs is dedicated to Schubert, and the precedent of ''Winterreise'' (and perhaps also of the earlier Schubert cycle, ''Die Schone Mullerin'') was patently on Krenek's mind. Schubert was Krenek's favorite composer. And in both works, the pianist's part -- sometimes commenting, sometimes pictorial, sometimes simply adding emphasis -- is as varied and demanding as the singer's.</p>
        <p>Still, any parallels must be drawn with caution. It may be suggestive to say, as The New Grove Dictionary does, that the ''Reisebuch'' is ''in the style'' of ''Winterreise,'' but like ''Winterreise,'' the ''Reisebuch'' actually spans many styles, from the delicate and wistful to the explosive. And whereas Schubert's melodies are often close to folk song (some, in fact, have been adopted as such), Krenek's, though shot through with catchy phrases, never are. And the texts bear no resemblance to each other in diction or narrative intent.</p>
        <p>Wilhelm Muller, the poet of ''Winterreise'' and ''Die Schone Mullerin,'' couched profound feeling in conventional forms and metaphorically charged but simple words. Disappointed in love, the introspective young traveler of ''Winterreise'' makes his path through anguish to lonely, numb despair. The protagonist of the ''Reisebuch'' is nothing like Muller's unworldly lad. Educated, self-conscious, gifted with a pointed wit, by turns analytic, solemn and satirical, occasionally apocalyptic, he displays a passionate, mercurial intricacy of thought few composers manage to reconcile with the lyric properties of song. Krenek does so.</p>
        <p>Though his journey (not incidentally, a round trip) takes many an emotional turn, its initial impulse is intellectual. ''Ich reise aus, meine Heimat zu entdecken,'' Krenek begins: ''I set out to discover my homeland.'' The opening song evokes an Austrian's supposedly innate self-doubt: ''Was anderen selbstverstandlich, ist uns Problem.'' (''What to others is obvious is to us a problem.'') Maybe in the Alps, Krenek speculates, the big picture will be clearer.</p>
        <p>And so we tag along to an ancient monastery where the monks condescend to the visitors, up peaks where people take snapshots rather than taking in the vistas, on to a cemetery so steep and narrow that the dead are buried standing on their feet. Sometimes it rains, and Krenek gets depressed. Sometimes it rains, and he enjoys it. The thought of politics fills him with horror for developments probably too far gone to avert. A sunny day by a lake puts him in mind of a promised land. He longs for home, but he longs for Italy, which is not his home. Back in Vienna, refreshed, he hopes for future travel -- and future homecomings to a fatherland that will not have ceased to exist while he was away.</p>
        <p>One song remains: the coda, ''Epilogue.'' As commentators like to point out, this one features a 12-tone row, prophesying music in Krenek's future. Even disregarding that detail, the song goes off in a radically new direction, intercutting the skeletal, extinguished manner Schubert invented for the last song of ''Winterreise'' with a declamatory affirmation of Krenek's good cheer in spite of all that might militate against it.</p>
        <p>Where that confidence came from is hard to fathom. As we can tell from songs earlier in the cycle, Krenek knew which way the wind was blowing. The ''Reisebuch'' is the confession of an exile-to-be. In the penultimate song as in the first, he puts his heart on his sleeve in the word ''Vaterland'' (''fatherland''). In three notes -- one step up, one step back down -- Krenek captures a longing that would last a lifetime.</p>
