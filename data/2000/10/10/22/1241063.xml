        <p>The Israeli government is making contingency plans for a total breakdown of the peace effort. Anticipating a Palestinian unilateral declaration of statehood, the Israelis are laying the groundwork for a ''unilateral separation,'' as they call it: us here and them there.</p>
        <p>For decades the vision of a new Middle East has reigned, a maximum cooperation model. But in the last few weeks, as the violence has settled into a prolonged conflict, the new Middle East has collapsed quickly into the old Middle East. And so the ideas of building fences rather than bridges have resurfaced.</p>
        <p>Ephraim Sneh, the Israeli deputy defense minister, who is overseeing an accelerated study of the concept, was not eager to discuss it on Friday morning. He still did not believe that the door had been slammed on peace, he said. But by day's end, after the Israeli government said it was considering a ''timeout'' from the peace effort starting next week, the need for a plan grew more urgent. Four more Palestinian protesters were reported killed in clashes today.</p>
        <p>[At a meeting of Arab nations in Cairo on Saturday, moderate leaders criticized Israel but tried to present peace as still the best option for transforming the region. Page 10.]</p>
        <p>At this stage, Mr. Sneh said he understood the psychological appeal for Israelis of separating from the Palestinians. But making that happen, he said, is incredibly complex. The two peoples share the same land and resources. A group of almost 200,000 Israelis -- the settlers -- still live in the West Bank and Gaza. And income from laborers in Israel last year accounted for fully a fifth of the Palestinian gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>''People say, 'I don't want to see anymore the Palestinians,' '' he said. ''But it doesn't work that way. The interdependence of the economies is such that you can't just detach them mechanically. We share water, electricity, electromagnetic space. It's not so simple.''</p>
        <p>Still, under orders from Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Mr. Sneh is quickly developing one plan and economic officials another.</p>
        <p>In its most absolute form, Israel would separate by creating its own borders, thereby carving out a Palestinian state as well. In its narrowest form, separation would be a kind of extended border closure, in which Palestinian areas would be sealed off, checkpoints reinforced and the movement of goods and labor severely restricted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak reportedly would want to proceed gradually. But if the Palestinians were to declare a state, he would probably move immediately to annex the large West Bank settlement blocks and cordon them off.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials reacted with horror when the idea was floated this week, both to begin preparing public opinion in Israel and to send a stern message to the Palestinians about what might lie ahead. ''It's a declaration of war,'' said Yasir Abed Rabbo, the information minister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abed Rabbo branded it ''an apartheid plan'' meant to strangle the Palestinians economically, isolate them geographically and impose by fiat what was not achieved through negotiations.</p>
        <p>In Israel, though, as daily clashes have become routine, raising the specter of a long period of instability and insecurity, the idea of a ''clean break'' is gaining currency. Some see it as a way to sublimate negative urges for vengeance.</p>
        <p>''For me, it's the way to go,'' said Yoel Ben Adam, a florist whose truck wears a Peace Now bumper sticker. ''Emotionally, I'd like to do worse things. But rationally, fine. They hate us. So we'll turn our backs, they can turn theirs.''</p>
        <p>Most Israeli analysts believe that Mr. Arafat intends to ride this wave of violence toward statehood, aiming for a Nov. 15 declaration, on the 12th anniversary of his symbolic declaration of independence in Algiers. ''The Israelis are proceeding on the theory that Arafat is on the path of riding the tiger toward a declaration of statehood on Nov. 15,'' a Western diplomat said. ''So Israel is making its plans for unilateral separation.''</p>
        <p>Israeli advocates of separation have unsuccessfully battled integration since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967. Moshe Dayan, then defense minister, squelched a plan to separate the Israeli and Palestinian societies, moving quickly to connect their water and electricity systems. Most leftists considered the integration model unhealthy, since it was based not on the ideals of peaceful Jewish-Arab coexistence but mostly on a desire to keep the Land of Israel whole and to promote the occupation.</p>
        <p>Since then, in periods of intense violence, the idea usually resurfaces. After the terror bombings when Yitzhak Rabin was prime minister, he pushed for a separation, although associates say he never thought it was realistic. Now, Israeli officials are studying an undoing of what Mr. Dayan did, including disentangling the water and electricity systems, which would inflict severe hardships on the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>And many Israelis still do not think separation is realistic, especially if undertaken unilaterally and by a weak prime minister.</p>
        <p>''I think it is impossible to be implemented unilaterally under the circumstances,'' said Shlomo Gazit, a retired general who was the first coordinator of the Israeli operation in the occupied territories. ''It's a big undertaking. It means the demarcation of a new border. It means annexing part of the West Bank with its settlers, but also evacuating others. And not as part of a peace agreement. Without peace.</p>
        <p>''Look at the so-called political power of the prime minister,'' he said. ''He can't unilaterally separate between Gilad Sher and Danny Yatom,'' two of his senior advisers.</p>
        <p>If separation is a response to the breakdown of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, cooperation -- political separation but economic and resource interdependence -- was the guiding spirit behind the last seven years of the peace effort. The Clinton administration and European aid donors enthusiastically promoted the entwining of the two economies, bankrolling joint industrial projects and investment schemes.</p>
        <p>The high-tech Israeli economy and the low-wage Palestinian work force made an ideal marriage, business leaders on both sides argued.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Barak, like his mentor, Mr. Rabin, was always skeptical of this cooperative vision, and saw the recent events as vindicating his preference for minimal interaction.  Since his campaign, he has continually cited Robert Frost, often mangling his well-known verse to say, ''High fences make good neighbors.''</p>
        <p>In a measure of his seriousness, Mr. Barak last week asked the country's top technocrat, Avi Ben-Bassat, staff director for the Finance Ministry, to assemble an interministerial task force and assess the feasibility and cost of a ''separation'' strategy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ben Bassat's team has already reached some preliminary conclusions. For instance, they believe that Israel could radically reduce its use of Palestinian laborers in agriculture and construction, with a side benefit of higher base wages and lower unemployment for unskilled Israeli workers.</p>
        <p>Normally, about 120,000 Palestinians cross into Israel for work each day, two-thirds of them illegally. The security measures of the past three weeks have cut that number to 25,000 or less, a level some analysts believe Israel could sustain.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to decrease dependence,'' Mr. Ben Bassat said. ''You cannot just disconnect the two economies, but you can gradually reduce interaction, and reduce the economic volatility.''</p>
        <p>A sharp reduction in Israeli work permits would be economically devastating for the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>''Separation will be much more costly for the Palestinians than for us, because our economy is 20 times bigger than theirs,'' Mr. Ben Bassat said. ''As an economist, I believe that the best thing for both economies here would be free trade and open borders. But there are other factors to consider here.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the final policy determination, the violence of the past three weeks has already pushed the Palestinian and Israeli economies further apart. Construction companies and other blue-collar Israeli employers are replacing Palestinian laborers with illegal immigrants from outside the region, Israeli officials say.</p>
        <p>After Palestinian protest strikes and arson attacks shut down Israeli-owned factories in border-zone industrial parks, several companies announced their intention to shift operations to low-wage countries outside the Middle East.</p>
        <p>And a new offshore natural gas business may be an early casualty. The British company exploring for gas off the Gaza Strip, BG International, has not received a requested security clearance from the Israeli Defense Ministry to drill a second test well there.</p>
        <p>If the Palestinians declared a state and the Israelis declared a unilateral separation, they would still leave their essential conflict unresolved.</p>
        <p>Jerusalem's status and the refugee problem would not just wither away. Either they would generate more violent conflict, or prod the two states to pick up where the peace negotiations left off, experts say. So even the parallel paths of unilateral actions, they say, are risky, and the optimists think that they eventually lead back to the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>''I think we will end up concluding that we need more Oslo, not less Oslo,'' said Uri Savir, a lawmaker and an architect of the Oslo interim peace agreement. ''The question is how many victims, how much blood will be spilled before then.''</p>
