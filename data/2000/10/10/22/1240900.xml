        <p>TODD KRIEGER was sitting in the Gaslight bar on far West 14th Street, explaining the Tao of cocktail parties. ''The longest time I talk to one person is 15 minutes,'' he said, slurping club soda through a straw. ''Engaging with someone is so great that if you do it, run with it. You know what they say about Michael Jordan: Always come out on top.''</p>

        <p>TODD KRIEGER was sitting in the Gaslight bar on far West 14th Street, explaining the Tao of cocktail parties. ''The longest time I talk to one person is 15 minutes,'' he said, slurping club soda through a straw. ''Engaging with someone is so great that if you do it, run with it. You know what they say about Michael Jordan: Always come out on top.''</p>
        <p>Then he shared his two top lines for extricating himself from a conversation: ''Excuse me, I need a drink'' and ''It's my bedtime.''</p>
        <p>Luckily for Mr. Krieger, a slight, dark-haired guy in a black Donna Karan suit, he didn't try either overly familiar phrase when he pushed off from his stool. Instead, he greeted an old college friend who had flown in from Miami to attend a party Thursday celebrating Mr. Krieger's new book, ''The Portable Pundit: A Crash Course in Cocktail Party Conversation'' (Warner Books). It is a 231-page, pocket-size cheat sheet that covers general strategy as well as specific topics for chat, from opera to the origins of Atari. Like a movie within a movie, Mr. Krieger, the author of a book about smart, witty conversations at cocktail parties, was suddenly required to make smart, witty conversation at his own party. How would he measure up?</p>
        <p>Never mind that the partygoers were mostly family and friends from publishing, film and television, not exactly a tough room. Mr. Krieger, an executive at Microsoft's WebTV, still cranked up the charm, moving from group to group.</p>
        <p>When a friend asked where his parents were, he replied: ''My folks? I learned everything from them. You are not late until 15 minutes have gone by.'' (See the meaning of the French expression ''Le quart d'heure de politesse,'' Page 127.) He regaled three young women in leather jackets, shouting over the live jazz musicians, ''You could pay the coroner to write 'Death by misadventure' on your autopsy report!'' (See the death of the Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones, Page 83.)</p>
        <p>At 7:30, after speaking with a couple about real estate (you can do better, Mr. Krieger), he excused himself, saying, ''I'm going to get that drink now.'' Resurfacing with a martini, he pressed a copy of his book onto Geraldine Laybourne, the chief executive of Oxygen Media.</p>
        <p>When Monique Stauder, a photographer, walked in at 8, Mr. Krieger hugged her and admired her shoes (''When all else fails, compliment their shoes,'' Page 226).</p>
        <p>His choreographed maneuvers were impressive, but they begged a question. Which came first, the suave cocktail party behavior or the book about it? Friends said Mr. Krieger's skills were organic. ''Todd was born to write it,'' Ethan Nosowsky, an editor at Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, said of the book. ''He's never at a loss for words. He just keeps things moving. And he has this bizarre talent for effortlessly blending the highbrow with the lowbrow.'' (Goethe, Page 121; gangsta rap, Page 80).</p>
        <p>Even as the party wound down, its high-energy host continued to bob and weave, hugging guests warmly, peering curiously into their shopping bags, laughing appreciatively, but not too appreciatively, at their remarks. ''It's like I'm at my own wedding,'' he said with a giant grin.</p>
        <p>He seemed to get emotional, which brought on an awkward lull. It felt like an apt time for him to jump-start the conversation with one of the lines he recommends for just that purpose, maybe ''I bet Noam Chomsky would have something to say about this'' or ''They say he killed a man'' (from ''The Great Gatsby'').</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Krieger said, ''Excuse me, I have to go say something to my friend Clay about his heinous jacket.''</p>
