        <p>ON the small, beautiful island of Nevis, where charming plantation inns grace misty slopes, little Oualie Beach Hotel down at the seaside is a bit less exalted. Its neat white cottages are dotted along the shore, facing a pretty bay.</p>
        <p>In July, Oualie's seafront was buzzing, as carpenters went about building new cottages and a reception center. The hotel is sought out by people looking for bargains on beaches, and the manager, Vaden Jones, is upgrading for winter, with 12 new rooms as well as 22 others; winter rates start at $195 plus 18 percent tax and service.</p>
        <p>Three and a half miles down the road on the same lovely coast, construction crews were even busier at the sumptuous 196-room Four Seasons Resort Nevis, closed after being pummeled by Hurricane Lenny last November, and being refined for its grand reopening next month. In high season, rooms on the ocean front are $750 a night.</p>
        <p>In contrast, during the storm, Oualie's cozy white cottages fared much better. Except for an invasion of debris, the casual, low-key resort came through virtually unscathed. Even the palapa shading a patch of sand in front of the hotel emerged bedraggled but still standing.</p>
        <p>The beach was actually enlarged by the storm, and there were no tennis courts, putting greens, ballrooms or swimming pools to be washed out.</p>
        <p>Oualie is one among many comfortable, budget to moderately priced resorts that can be found throughout the Caribbean,  where starting rates for a double room in high season range from less than $100 to around $265 a night without tax and service.  On these same islands, it is not hard to spend twice that for a hotel oozing with luxury, with an array of activities and indulgences that, for some of us anyway, are not a must -- to be spritzed with Evian water on a beachside chaise longue, for example, or  massaged with exotic oils in a gazebo.</p>
        <p>The most desirable of the reasonably priced places are not merely less luxurious knockoffs of upscale resorts. On the contrary, they are varied: idiosyncratic and charming or calm and almost bland, among other characteristics. The common thread is the inviting prices. Some, like Oualie, are beachside and casual with a strong sense of place. Some require a trek or a ride to the beach in a shuttle bus. In many, the principal entertainment comes with the territory -- pleasures pegged to natural wonders, bird-watching, diving, snorkeling, trudging through a rain forest or up a volcano. Or just sipping a rum punch while admiring the colors in a sunset worth the plane trip.</p>
        <p>Overall, there is a surprising range of choice in the budget or moderate category: historic inns, romantically remote rooms with balconies and views, family resorts equipped with boogie boards and kayaks, hotels for fishing enthusiasts and chamber music lovers, an inn offering a seven-night  package with four of the nights on a yacht, spacious condos, bed-and-breakfasts where the owners double as concierges.</p>
        <p>Some of the newer accommodations are in moderately priced chain hotels -- good news for the finicky, who would prefer to pass up a night in a charming room with lame plumbing and an occasional stray lizard in favor of a modern motel unit with a reliable shower. One of these, a Comfort Suites resort, opened early this year 300 feet from a beach on Grand Cayman.</p>
        <p>And in a class of its own, on small, picturesque Saba, the Ecolodge Rendez-Vous will open next year, near a network of walking trails. For $85 a night in high season, noise and pollution free, it will require a five-minute hike from a dead-end road. A donkey named Eco will assist with bags.</p>
        <p>Wherever you go in the Caribbean, finding an inexpensive room is easy; choosing the right one is not. Since there is no Caribbeanwide rating system, choices are often a gamble. Change is a constant; hotel managers leave, owners sell; hurricanes rearrange beaches. Guidebooks may be obsolete before reaching bookstores and Web sites stale. And without the known quantity of a brand name, you must view descriptions with suspicion. ''You have to work at finding a budget hotel that suits you,'' says Tim Grace, publisher of The Caribbean Gold Book, a resource for travel agents with  details about hundreds of hotels in the region. ''They aren't going to turn up on a plate.''</p>
        <p>As many travelers know, lower prices can often be found through packages covering accommodations, air fares and at least some meals.</p>
        <p>When booking independently, try haggling. A variety of Caribbean hotel keepers interviewed recently said rates were negotiable even in high season if occupancy rates fell. ''We yield like the airlines do if we have a lot of rooms available,'' the manager of a small spiffy hotel said forthrightly, though he refused to be quoted by name. In winter, the prime time for bargaining is January after the holidays; Christmas and New Year's weeks are generally not negotiable.  If the dollar remains strong, there will be good hunting grounds this winter on French islands like Martinique and Guadeloupe, where the dollar exchange rate with the franc is very favorable.</p>
        <p>Following are assorted reasonably priced possibilities for this winter -- on, above and beyond the beaches. Rates refer to a room, suite or cottage for two in high season.</p>

        <p>Anguilla</p>
        <p>If you dream of a clean simple room on a quiet beach and a blue green sea -- with maid service -- the white stucco Blue Waters Beach Apartments offer that along with kitchens, private verandas, beach chairs and umbrellas. The furniture is built in; mattresses are king-sized resting on box springs and a concrete base. Rooms are cooled by ceiling fans and sea breezes. The Trattoria Tramonto, a North Italian restaurant, is nearby, as is a $4,000-a-night villa.</p>
        <p>At Blue Waters a one-bedroom apartment is $250 a night, plus 18 percent tax and service, including maid service six days a week. The crescent beach, Shoal Bay West, has been restored after being pounded last year by Hurricane Lenny. The trouble is that  apartments are often filled with repeat guests.

        <p>Antigua</p>
        <p>Sturdy little Admiral's Inn, built in 1788, faces the waterfront along English Harbour, once a hangout for Horatio Nelson and his fellow officers in the British Navy. The more appealing of the 14 rooms are in the weathered brick gray-shuttered main building in Nelson's Dockyard. In front of the inn are  terraces planted with casuarina trees and  yellow bellflowers and having views of the harbour.</p>
        <p>Rooms are whitewashed with beamed ceilings and dark plank floors; beds are covered with toile spreads. Ceiling fans cool the rooms, with air-conditioning in some. The inn is noisiest during Antigua's annual Sailing Week each spring, when yachting crowds dine at the restaurant and toast the race winners. A beach is about 10 minutes away on the inn's shuttle boat, which ferries guests through the magnificent old harbor to a secluded bay. A room with a view is $160, plus 18.5 percent tax and service; (268) 460-1027, fax (268) 460-1534. www.antiguanice.com</p>
        <p>Aruba</p>
        <p>Bucuti Beach Resort lies on 14 acres at the south end of Eagle Beach, which extends three miles to the north, an area of low-rise resorts. You may order lunch or drinks from your lounge chair by raising a red pennant, dine in the hotel's Pirates' Nest Restaurant -- built to resemble a 16th-century Dutch galleon -- and look at the sea from the open-air fitness center with two treadmills, a bicycle, a stair climber, weights and bench press. Or you can stroll to the small, bustling  Alhambra Casino, adjacent to Bucuti's parking lot. The hotel says there are 20 restaurants within walking distance.</p>
        <p>The 63 rooms and junior suites have balconies or terraces, minibars, microwaves, refrigerators, coffee makers, hair dryers, safes, irons, ironing boards and cable television. There is a small pool. Rates start at $230, plus 17.66 percent tax and service;  (800) 223-1108 for reservations or 011 (297) 831100, fax 011 (297) 825272. www.bucuti.com</p>
        <p>Bahamas</p>
        <p>Cape Santa Maria Beach Resort overlooks the sea along four miles of white sand at the tip of Long Island, part of the Bahamas' string of tranquil Outer Islands. In 21  air-conditioned beach-front units (11 villas),  ceiling fans cool screened verandas. Seaside gazebos offer shade. There is a new beach house with a cheerful and casual restaurant, bar, fitness center and television room.</p>
        <p>Cape Santa Maria is part of the Canada-based Oak Bay Marine Group, a collection of resorts that focus mainly on fishing. One bedroom cottages cost $245, plus 16 percent tax and service; (800) 663-7090 for reservations or (242) 338-5273, fax (242) 338-6013.  Bicycling and snorkeling and scuba diving are among the activities; $2.50 an hour for a bike rental. www.capesantamaria.com</p>
        <p>Barbados</p>
        <p>On Barbados's lively South coast, the Bougainvillea Beach Resort has 100 brightly decorated, air-conditioned suites, each with a balcony and sea view, kitchenettes or kitchens. There are two pools, one with a swim-up bar, a tennis court, fitness center and free Internet access. The full-service restaurant, Lanterns by the Sea, offers entertainment six nights a week; limbo dancers and fire eaters on Thursdays. Boogie boards, windsurfing equipment and small boats are available to guests without charge.</p>
        <p>Rates start at $218, plus 12.5 percent tax and service; (246) 418-0990, fax (246) 428-2524. In high season, the minimum stay is generally seven nights.</p>
        <p>www.funbarbados.com/lodgings/bougainvillea.cfm</p>
        <p>Bonaire</p>
        <p>Plaza Resort Bonaire says it has 300,000 trees and plants. Even without the landscaped gardens, the resort, which includes a casino, scuba center and a white sand beach, is one of the more upscale hotels on an island known for idyllic diving. Though Bonaire lies outside the hurricane belt, some of its coral was lost in the waves stirred by Hurricane Lenny last year, but damage was mainly in the shallower waters, and the reefs are recovering.</p>
        <p>The hotel's 200 air-conditioned suites and villas are in low-rise white stucco, Mediterranean-style red-roofed buildings set along pathways. Suites have sitting areas decorated with Italian tile floors and are furnished with two queen beds, safes, coffee makers and minirefrigerators. There are four lighted tennis courts, three bars and three restaurants. The scuba center, Toucan Diving, offers instruction as well as trips to the reefs.  Rates start at $240, including tax and service.  For reservations (800) 766-6016 or 011 (599) 717 2500, fax 011 (599) 717 7133.  www.plazaresortbonaire.com</p>
        <p>Cayman Islands</p>
        <p>The new Comfort Suites and Resort, outfitted with a dive shop and water sports center, lies 300 feet from Grand Cayman's spectacular Seven Mile Beach, where there are lounge chairs for the guests. Its 110 units come in assorted sizes with kitchenettes or full kitchens. There is a poolside restaurant and bar, as well as room service and fitness and laundry rooms. Rates at the hotel start at $240, including Continental breakfast, plus 20 percent tax and service with a 10 percent discount for booking online at www.choicehotels.com; (800) 517-4000 for reservations or (345) 945-7300, fax (345) 945-7400.</p>
        <p>www.caymancomfort.com</p>
        <p>On small coral-rich Cayman Brac, Walton's Mango Manor is made up of five guest rooms in a house on a strip of land between the island-long bluff and the sea. The best sandy beaches are on the south side of the island, about 10 minutes away, but Mango Manor has good snorkeling offshore. Parrots frequent the grounds. The innkeepers direct guests to the best places for hiking, spelunking and rock climbing and help with booking rental cars, scuba and snorkeling trips. All rooms have private baths. Rates at Mango Manor start at $90, including a full breakfast, but not the 10 percent tax; phone and fax (345) 948-0518. www.waltonsmangomanor.com</p>
        <p>Curacao</p>
        <p>Once a private mansion, the Avila Beach Hotel echoes the fetching Dutch Colonial architecture seen in Willemstad, Curacao's attractive capital. Now with additions, there are 100 rooms, 8 suites and attractions that  include a beach divided in two parts by a pier, snorkeling and a recital hall where chamber music concerts are held. The newer section, the Blues Wing, is a two-story wooden building on a jetty with a watchtower; its 20 rooms have kitchenettes, Jacuzzi baths  and private balconies overlooking the sea.</p>
        <p>The hotel's open-air Belle Terrace restaurant sits in the shade of a flamboyant tree.  The Blues, a jazz bar and restaurant, specializes in lobster and sunsets. Rates at Avila,  which lies on the outskirts of Willemstad, start at $160 and, in the Blues Wing, $255, plus 19 percent tax and service; 011 (599-9) 461-4377, fax 011 (599-9) 461-1493.  www.avilahotel.com</p>
        <p>Dominica</p>
        <p>Zandoli Inn is set on a hillside on the island's south coast, about 30 minutes from Roseau, the capital. Eighty steps descend to the sea, which is covered with boulders that for the agile serve as entry to snorkeling. Last winter, whales visited offshore for a week. The owner-managers, Tony Hall, an architect who designed the inn, and his wife, Linda Hyland, say the waterfront is safe for good swimmers; there is no beach, and the water is 10 feet deep in front of the rocks. The inn also has a small pool and trails. The two of them help guests plan excursions to Dominica's splendid rain forest, mountains, waterfalls, reefs and the large boiling lake.</p>
        <p>The five simple rooms with private baths have solar-heated hot-water showers, balconies, sea views and fans. The queen-sized beds have canopies of mosquito netting, which also discourages the island's king-size grasshoppers and moths. There is a restaurant (for guests only) serving local fish and produce. Rates are $150, including Continental breakfast, plus 15 percent tax and service; (767) 446-3161, fax (767) 446-3344. www.zandoli.com</p>
        <p>Dominican Republic</p>
        <p>Hotel Villa Serena is attractively placed on a crescent-shaped beach with two acres of tropical gardens, coconut trees, a small stone-edged pool and stone walkways, in the village of Las Galeras on the Samana Peninsula. Ten of the 21 guest rooms were added this year, when the restaurant was enlarged; each room has a different style, ranging from Laura Ashley to a jungle mood. French doors lead to balconies with views of the pool and the sea. Many guests are attracted by the prospect of seeing whales in Samana Bay. Rates at the hotel in rooms with air-conditioning are $120, including a full American-style breakfast, taxes and the use of beach towels and bicycles; (809) 538-0000, fax (809) 538-0009.  www.villaserena.com</p>
        <p>Grenada</p>
        <p>Secret Harbour Resort overlooks Mount  Hartman Bay with yachts heeling in the distance. Essentially a boating resort that is part of the Moorings, the Florida-based yacht charter company, it appeals to some guests simply for the attractive Spanish-Mediterranean architecture, the 20 rooms furnished with four-poster beds, bathrooms decorated with Italian tiles and the views of the harbor. There is a pool, a tennis court and a dive shop. The hotel runs a free ferry to nearby beaches. Rates start at $230 a day, plus 18 percent taxes and service; (473) 444-4548, fax (473) 444-4819.</p>
        <p>For a splurge, the Moorings offers a Shore and Sail package, (800) 437-7880 for reservations, with three nights at the resort and four cruising on a 50-foot, four-cabin yacht, which you may or may not have to share with two other couples, depending on demand. The per couple rate is $2,576, including tax, meals,  drinks and snacks aboard the yacht but not at the resort. www.secretharbour.com</p>
        <p>Guadeloupe</p>
        <p>On remote Marie-Galante, 18 miles off the coast of Guadeloupe, La Cohoba Hotel sits on Folle Anse, a splendid uncrowded beach edged with sea grape and mahogany trees.  Open and airy, the hotel has a restaurant serving French and Creole food, a pool, volleyball and two tennis courts. The 100 rooms have air-conditioning, television, safes, telephones and terraces; 40 have kitchenettes.</p>
        <p>Marie-Galante offers hiking, biking and opportunities to practice your French; you may need to. Rates start at $144, including Continental breakfast, tax and service; (800) 322-2223 for reservations, or 011 (590) 97-50-50, fax 011 (590) 97-97-96.</p>

        <p>Jamaica</p>

Accommodations are in 10 villas extended over the edge of the water with terraces, 12 studios with balconies looking toward the garden or sea, and a block of 6 hotel rooms with balconies and garden views, all built of wood, stone and thatch and outfitted with custom-designed furniture. The villas' and studios' showers are open to the sky. Waves occasionally splash the 60-foot cliffside pool. The restaurant cuisine is varied, with a Jamaican twist. Rates start at $95, plus 16.25 percent tax and service; (876) 957-4373, fax (876) 957-0557.</p>

        <p>Martinique</p>
        <p>Guests at the beach-front, family-run Diamant les Bains, reminiscent of a budget hotel in Europe, can admire the view of  offshore Diamont Rock, buy tempting picnic fare at the neighborhood superette, and dine on French and creole dishes at the hotel restaurant. The more livable of the 27 small, simple rooms are in 20 air-conditioned bungalows with ceramic tile floors, wicker furniture, small refrigerators and diminutive bathrooms with showers. There is a pool in the garden. The bungalow rates are about $87, including Continental breakfast, plus a nominal tax of 50 cents a day per person; (800) 823-2002) for reservations or 011 (596) 7 64014, fax 011 (596) 7 62700.</p>
        <p>Puerto Rico</p>
        <p>Looking out on the sea, the Gallery Inn occupies a Spanish colonial building in Old San Juan. Its 24 rooms and suites -- arrayed alongside stairs, courtyards and vine-festooned patios -- are decorated with art from floor to ceiling, including some of the closets.  In the rooms without views there are paintings of views. Each of the 24 units is different. All are air-conditioned and have private bathrooms. The lowest rate, $145, plus 14 percent tax and service, applies to the smaller, simpler rooms in the oldest (300-year-old) sections of the house. The rates include Continental breakfast. A free trolleylike bus, which rolls through the narrow streets of Old San Juan, stops across the street from the inn; (787) 722-1808, fax (787) 724-7360.</p>

        <p>St. Eustatius</p>
        <p>When they leave for the day, guests at Kings Well Inn, built on a slope overlooking the sea, don't bother locking their doors.

        <p>Two opulent options: back in business after the storm</p>
        <p>Two Caribbean luxury resorts closed by Hurricane Lenny last November will reopen soon, back in shape and embellished.</p>
        <p>On Anguilla, the palatial Cap Juluca is scheduled to take its first guests on Saturday, with the white sands outside its elegant white Moorish-style villas restored. All 98  rooms, including those in suites and villas,  have been refurbished in the hotel's usual sleek style. New improvements and services include the renovation of Pimms restaurant and the addition of massage and beauty options. But the main swimming pool, two of the three restaurants, George's and the new Casbah-like Kemia, offering tapas and other appetizers from around the world, will not be ready until Dec. 1. The honeymooning couples who have booked rooms in early November will have to do without sushi and dim sum.</p>
        <p>Winter rates start at $700, plus 18 percent tax and service, though the same room will cost $375 through Dec. 17. Prices include Continental breakfast served on the guests' terraces, afternoon tea, use of water sports equipment, tennis on three courts, a health club, croquet and use of a putting green. Reservations: (888) 858-5822 or (264) 497- 6779, fax (294) 497-6617.</p>

        <p>The Four Seasons Resort Nevis, with 196 plush rooms and suites in gingerbread-trimmed cottages on four-mile-long Pinney's Beach, plans to reopen Nov. 24, its assorted restaurants and bars, 10 tennis courts, 18-hole golf course, fitness center and accommodations, all with balconies or patios and large marble bathrooms, as spiffy as ever. There will be two new free-form pools, a redesigned Cabana restaurant and beach bar, more entertainment for young adults, a larger children's activity center, a new conference room and a business center with high-speed Internet access. But the most significant addition will be offshore and underwater: a stone reef designed to prevent damage from flood waters caused by huge waves, which battered and closed the resort last year.</p>
        <p>High season prices start at $675; Nov. 24 to Dec. 18, from $450; plus 18 percent tax and service. Reservations: (800) 332-3442, or (869) 469-1111, fax (869) 469-1040.</p>
