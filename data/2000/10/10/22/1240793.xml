        <p>FEELING left out? Don't worry; there's a group or club or society you can join for any interest you might have.</p>
        <p>Obsessed with gristmills, windmills or perhaps the Mills Brothers? Try Spoom, the Society for the Preservation of Old Mills. Got a thing for hammering and/or aluminum? Enlist in the Hammered Aluminum Collectors Association.</p>
        <p>And then there's the Potteries of Trenton Society, which today is holding an event that anyone with an attic or sideboard should find irresistible.</p>
        <p>The group, which studies Trenton's once-sprawling ceramic industry, is having a ''Dish Discovery Day.'' Bring in all those pieces of pottery and china you've had lying around, and the experts will try to identify them. You know the ones: the plate that's been under a potted plant since the Carter administration, the dainty whatsit that has no obvious function but that you've kept because it might be valuable.</p>
        <p>From 1 to 2 this afternoon, you can haul such treasures to Ellarslie, the Trenton City Museum, and the experts will try to tell you where and when they were made. There will be no appraisals, but the experts will tell you whether the thing should stay under the plant or be rushed to the nearest safe deposit box. Then, from 2 to 3, they'll discuss the day's most interesting puzzles.</p>
        <p>The underappreciated little museum has a well-conceived exhibition that introduces you to a very different Trenton from the one of bureaucrats and minor-league baseball. It's the Trenton that for more than a century supplied dishes, bathroom fixtures and other ceramics to the state and nation, from basic dinnerware to White House place settings. Patricia Madrigal, the president of the pottery group, said a crippling strike in the 1920's and the emergence of plastics doomed the industry, but in the glory years perhaps 50 ceramics companies operated at once in the city.</p>
        <p>So the pottery society, which consists of archaeologists and historians and plain old collectors, has plenty to study. To get its experts warmed up for Dish Discovery Day, I put some of them to the test recently with a hodgepodge of pieces.</p>
        <p>I could see right away that these are people who like a good puzzle: when I walked into Hunter Research, a historical consulting company in Trenton where Ms. Madrigal and several other members work, a half-dozen folks stood around a large table that was covered with broken pottery. The debris had been retrieved from a construction site. The group was hoping the shards could reveal which companies had operated where, and at what times.</p>
        <p>My first what-is-it test, a vase, was intentionally easy; the markings clearly identified it as having been made by Lenox, a company that was born in Trenton. Still, the experts were able to add a detail: the fact that the marking was in gold somehow told them the vase had been made since 1989.</p>
        <p>Next came two plates. One, green and embellished with a summer scene, has been under a spider plant for years. The other, white with a flower on it, has had the ignominious job of holding cat food. The experts pegged the cat plate to 1955 and the other to 1953, both from factories in Ohio, Trenton's main competition for decades.</p>
        <p>Then I brought out a contribution from my mom, a pitcher passed on to her by her mother. ''Oh, that's not worth anything,'' one of the experts said.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' added another, ''just leave that here when you go.''</p>
        <p>Suspecting something, I pressed for details, and they confessed: the thing was Royal Worcester, made in Britain in 1885 or 1886. It's worth hundreds of dollars.</p>
        <p>I was, by this point, impressed with how much trained eyes could read into old plates and pitchers. But to truly amaze me, these experts had to handle my trick question, so I sprung it: an unsightly sculpture made by my daughter in the seventh grade, now broken into four pieces.</p>
        <p>Dave Goldberg, who has written histories of Trenton's potteries, studied the largest piece, then said, ''This was made by your daughter.'' I hadn't told him I had a daughter. ''And,'' he continued, looking more closely, ''it's a cat.'' Which it was.</p>
        <p>''Ah, but what's the cat doing?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>He looked closer, studying the boxy thing the cat was standing beside. On the boxy thing was a small cylinder, and on the cylinder the child had etched, ''Comet.''</p>
        <p>''The cat,'' Mr. Goldberg announced, ''is doing the dishes.''</p>
        <p>You can't beat the experts.</p>
