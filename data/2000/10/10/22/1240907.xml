        <p>On a typical morning at P.S. 33, cars, buses and pedestrians jockey for space as parents hurriedly drop their children off for the day.</p>
        <p>The traffic gridlock brought complaints from both drivers and people who walk their children to school.</p>
        <p>The traffic, in fact, has been so congested, with cars double- and triple-parked near its entrances, that the police have instituted a zero-tolerance policy for illegal parking there and at all other schools in the 105th Precinct. Under the policy, which began last month, they vowed to ticket all traffic violators.</p>
        <p>Nafeezah Khan, one parent, said traffic congestion around P.S. 33, at 222nd Street between 91st and 92nd Avenues, has improved since the police started the ticketing.</p>
        <p>''Before then, it was crazy,'' said Mrs. Khan, who has two daughters at the school. ''Recently it's been a lot better because people realize how serious it is when they start getting that $55 ticket.''</p>
        <p>Since the policy took effect, the police said, the number of parking summonses they issue has increased, although they had no specific numbers.</p>
        <p>Rick Duskiewicz, president of the Creedmoor Civic Association, said he supported the police department's tough stance.</p>
        <p>''I hope it's something that's not just a one-shot deal, but that's going to be able to last for the upcoming months,'' Mr. Duskiewicz said. Many of the parents who drive agree that the traffic situation makes the area around the school unsafe. But their behavior does not always reflect those beliefs.</p>
        <p>One example is Gordy Armand, who double-parked his car last Tuesday afternoon on 91st Avenue while waiting for two of his children to leave P.S. 33. His children could ride the bus, he said, but he drives them to school because it is more convenient.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armand said he did not know about the new police policy, but he is aware that double-parking is against the law.</p>
        <p>''The rule is not really enforced,'' said Mr. Armand, a 34-year-old car salesman. ''I had no other choice. My kids usually wait for me right there.''</p>
