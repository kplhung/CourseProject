        <p>PARASITE REX</p>
        <p>Inside the Bizarre World</p>
        <p>of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures.</p>
        <p>By Carl Zimmer.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 298 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Free Press. $26.</p>
        <p>Charles Darwin spent eight years researching barnacles, which he recognized as a degenerate form of typical arthropod. Lazy in their own way, most barnacles settle as larvae on the side of another animal, like a crab or whale. That animal henceforth does the walking for the barnacle, which cements itself, loses most of its front end and spends the rest of its life beating its legs to bring food particles into its tough little volcano-shaped shell.</p>
        <p>Darwin knew barnacles had evolved strange habits, but even he didn't know just how weird they could be. Sacculina, which Carl Zimmer in ''Parasite Rex'' calls a ''precise horror,'' begins life as a free-swimming larva. The female larva settles on a crab, crawls to a joint in its leg, pokes a hole in it, and squeezes her soft parts through it into the crab's insides, leaving behind the husk of her shell. She then makes her way, sluglike, to the abdomen and begins to feed on the nutrients that the crab digests. She forms a bulge in its shell as she grows and sends extensions of her own body, called ''roots,'' throughout the crab's body, even to its eye stalks. Soon the crab no longer grows or molts its shell and cannot make eggs or sperm; it's a ''walking corpse,'' as Zimmer describes it, living only to serve its relentless parasite.</p>
        <p>This grotesquerie would have been enough to disgust Darwin's Victorian audience, but there's more. A pinhole opening in the crab's abdomen, made by the female Sacculina, attracts the tiny male, who injects himself into the crab much as the female did. They fertilize each other for the rest of their lives; but to compound the insult, they manipulate the crab's hormonal system so that the crab periodically climbs a high rock, squeezes out the parasite's larvae and waves its claws in the water to speed them on their way -- just as it would do for its own offspring.</p>
        <p>Horrors like this pile up through page after page of Zimmer's book, though each one is there not for shock value but for a lesson in evolution. This is not your father's parasitology, a catechism of various worms, viruses, bacteria, protists, and of nostrums to repel them. It's an appreciation of the complexity of strategies parasites use to work their wonders on plants and animals. Eukaryotic parasites (those other than viruses and bacteria) don't respond well to vaccines and they don't behave like other diseases. Their life cycles are usually too complex and their defenses too pernicious for easy treatment. They tend to mimic their hosts biochemically, so that they go undetected, slip past normal defenses or fool the host into providing protection. You generally have to break their complex life cycles or make the host inhospitable to get them to leave, and it's not easy. They're good at using the host's own biochemicals for defense, and some can even alter the host's DNA for their own ends.</p>
        <p>We know comparatively little about the evolutionary history of most parasites; worms, leeches and flukes don't fossilize well. But we do know that although these parasitic forms have lost many body parts and the structural complexity of their relatives, they have retained a formidable behavioral complexity. That behavioral flexibility became the main strategy of parasite evolution: it allowed them to become insidious. They can change a host's personality so that rats boldly sniff hay stained with cat urine, killifish get an inexplicable urge to thrash wildly at the water's surface in sight of predatory herons, and pillbugs suddenly shun the dark safety of leaf litter -- all to ensure that these animals become the next meal of the parasite's next host.</p>
        <p>As examples mount, the book starts to feel like an episode of ''The X-Files.'' Then, with perfect timing, Zimmer begins a disquisition on TV and movie scripts that depend on evolutionary parasitology, sometimes cryptically, for the premises of some terrific spine-tinglers (think ''Alien''). And why not? Parasites are even known to be responsible for some aberrant personality changes in humans. They do whatever it takes to propagate their gametes. This is perhaps why some parasites are so debilitating and others are comparatively benign. The hanta virus is lethal, and after the death of its host the spores retreat to the ground, to be inhaled by the next passerby. Another parasite merely weakens a deer enough to become the target of a wolf pack, its next host. And the common cold virus of humans is relatively gentle, if chronically annoying. In evolutionary biology, there are no simple rules.</p>
        <p>Most people would never dream of the many kinds of effects that parasites have on organisms they colonize. But after reading Zimmer's book, it will be a long time before you'll think of drinking from that clear mountain stream. You'll see those cute deer and bunnies as walking bags of contagion, crippled internally by thousands of life-sappers. You'll give a plate of sushi the fisheye. And you might search your past for those travels to exotic locales where you could have picked up a freeloader that years later is causing you aches, dizziness and indigestion -- a syndrome that has made at least one doctor suspect that the malaise that afflicted Darwin's later years was really Chagas disease, contracted from a parasitic worm in South America.</p>
        <p>The detective work behind all this is fascinating and frequently ingenious. Zimmer follows medics treating sleeping sickness in Sudan, fieldworkers assessing internal parasites in Costa Rica, curators tending the National Parasite Collection in a disused guinea pig barn in Maryland. And everywhere he finds that the scientists themselves are as amazed as he is at the complexity and cleverness of parasites. There seems to be no limit to how rapidly these bugs can spread, how they can jump among hosts and how they can complicate their life cycles to avoid eradication. Even our human history seems little more than a burst of opportunity for them. Blood flukes have passed between snails and rats at watering holes on the African savanna for millions of years. Zimmer argues cogently that when our hominid ancestors wandered out from the forests and stopped at these watering holes, the flukes were only too happy to diversify their portfolio and infest a new host. Humans carried their bugs with them as they spread globally, and for parasites the domestication of livestock was like the opening of Zabar's. (Trichinosis, for example, arose as a human disease when we started to eat pork.)</p>
        <p>Zimmer concludes by documenting recent attempts to reduce parasitism on domesticated animals and crops by giving the parasites a taste of their own medicine. Introducing parasites of parasites has also been used to cut populations of invading or ''weed'' species of plants and animals that are destroying or outcompeting native species. But such treatments are dicey because the cure may be worse than the disease. The use of a parasite that can knock out the invading green crab in the waters off San Francisco could unwittingly destroy the prized Dungeness crab industry as well.</p>
        <p>Carl Zimmer is a science writer who has contributed tremendously to the popular understanding of science, especially evolution. His ''At the Water's Edge'' (1998) was the first real book about integrative biology, the science of solving biological questions by bringing together evidence from normally separate disciplines, from molecular biology to paleontology. With ''Parasite Rex,'' Zimmer proves himself as fine a science essayist as we have, in the company of John McPhee, David Quammen and John Noble Wilford -- writers who are not by trade scientists but who get the science right and explain it beautifully. The importance of Zimmer's book lies not only in its accessible presentation of the new science of evolutionary parasitology but in its thoughtful treatment of the global strategies and policies that scientists, health workers and governments will have to consider in order to manage parasites in the future -- one hopes as successfully as parasites have managed us for millions of years.</p>
