        <p>Congressional Republicans are locked in a battle with the White House over easing immigration law that threatens to undercut Gov. George W. Bush's efforts to court Hispanic voters and shed the party's lingering image as insensitive to new immigrants.</p>
        <p>As Congress draws to a close, among the last sticking points between President Clinton and Republicans on a year-end budget deal are Democratic proposals to grant limited amnesty to hundreds of thousands of longtime residents who came to the United States illegally, expand permanent residency to certain Central Americans and help certain other immigrants obtain green cards.</p>
        <p>The provisions are in a spending bill that finances the State, Commerce and Justice departments. Mr. Clinton has threatened to veto the legislation if it does not include the immigration proposals.</p>
        <p>The stakes appear much higher for Republicans than Democrats. Many conservatives argue that bowing to Mr. Clinton would reward lawbreakers and encourage a new wave of illegal immigrants. But rejecting the legislation could alienate Hispanic voters just before Election Day, and resurrect the divisive fights of the 1990's over immigrants' benefits that hurt Republicans in many immigrant communities.</p>
        <p>A coalition of business groups with ties to Republicans, including health care providers, restaurant owners and landscapers, has also endorsed the changes as necessary to retain badly needed workers.</p>
        <p>''If the Republican Party is really serious about changing its image in the Latino community, it's hard to understand their resistance to these proposals,'' said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy of the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights group.</p>
        <p>Democrats say they are united behind the proposals, which Vice President Al Gore has said are essential to ''ensure fairness and equity for certain immigrants and their families already in the United States.''</p>
        <p>But Republicans are split. House and Senate Republican leaders have balked at the provisions. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip, acknowledged that some immigrants' cases were mishandled in the 1980's, and should be remedied. ''But the president wants a blanket amnesty,'' Mr. DeLay said.  ''He's playing politics. He's trying to buy votes through an amnesty.''</p>
        <p>Several other prominent Republicans, including Jack Kemp, the party's 1996 vice-presidential nominee; Senator John McCain of Arizona and Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, the House Republican re-election chairman, support the proposals. Mr. Davis said that one in five adults in his suburban Washington district was born overseas.</p>
        <p>''It is the right thing to do, and our leaders on both sides of the aisle should find a way to bring it to a vote,'' Mr. McCain said on the Senate floor on Sept. 27.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush, of Texas, sought to distance himself from the contentious issue.</p>
        <p>''The governor has not gotten involved in the maneuvering or negotiations with any specific immigration bills,'' said Ray Sullivan, a Bush campaign spokesman. ''The governor has said he does not support a blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants at this time.''</p>
        <p>But another Bush adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed concern that the issue could backfire on Republicans, adding, ''We're trying to find a way to do this without making it a political issue.''</p>
        <p>The legislation, called the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, would make three major changes in immigration law.</p>
        <p>First, the measure would allow at least 400,000 immigrants who came to the United States illegally before 1986 to apply for permanent residency, as people who came before 1972 were already able to do.</p>
        <p>Proponents say many of these immigrants were wrongfully denied amnesty under an earlier law when the Immigration and Naturalization Service bungled their claims. Critics say some of those cases should be reviewed by a court, but that in many others immigrants are not entitled to a green card, which confers permanent residency.</p>
        <p>''If we keep granting amnesty to people who came to the country illegally, we are in essence putting up a neon sign on all of our borders saying, Violate our law, come into our country illegally,'' said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.</p>
        <p>The second provision calls for granting legal status to 300,000 immigrants who fled wars and political chaos in Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Liberia, and applied unsuccessfully for refugee status. Proponents say these immigrants should be treated the same as those from Cuba and Nicaragua, who were granted legal status in 1997.</p>
        <p>The third provision would permit immigrants who are changing their legal status to pay a $1,000 fee and complete the process in the United States, rather than return to their home country and leave relatives here behind.</p>
        <p>Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, has countered the Democrats' plan with a proposal to adjudicate some of the amnesty claims, and grant temporary visas to reunite spouses and children with legal permanent residents here.</p>
        <p>Most Democrats hailed Mr. Hatch's plan, but said it fell short.</p>
