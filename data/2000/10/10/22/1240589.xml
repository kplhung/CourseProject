        <p>YANKEE DOODLE DANDY</p>
        <p>The Life and Times</p>
        <p>of Tod Sloan.</p>
        <p>By John Dizikes.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 225 pp. New Haven:</p>
        <p>Yale University Press. $22.50.</p>
        <p>Does John Dizikes like the man his new book is about? It's a fair question; while he has thought about Tod Sloan for a dozen years, he grumbles at him a lot in ''Yankee Doodle Dandy.'' Actually, this crankiness is a snare for the reader. Dizikes is a social historian whose previous book, ''Opera in America,'' demonstrated how deep and disturbing a vision of society he can evoke while apparently writing about a mere diversion. ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'' sharpens the art. It is not as stylish, but its 200 pages, filled with uncomfortable, annoying questions about what kind of people we are, can leave you feeling you've just had the stuffing punched out of you by a tough, Socratic wit.</p>
        <p>At first glance the book's suggestion that 100 years ago Sloan was the first sports superstar, forebear of Michael Jordan, looks like a bad joke. Sloan was a 90-pound jockey, five feet tall in his size 3 shoes. But it makes some sense. Modern celebrity was invented in the 1890's and racing was the first national sport. Sloan, intuiting that publicity was power, knew how to feed the flood of press stories about his fancy clothes, profligate spending, entourages of women, lavish parties, fast mouth and cocky attitude. What was rare was that he also knew how to hide behind the glitter; he often seems to be all outside and no inside -- not a biographer's dream.</p>
        <p>Racing had co-opted the country's deepest passion, gambling, so there was vast political power and social cachet in it. People who cashed in on Wall Street competed to build splendid racetracks, some with casinos under the stands. Dizikes understands gambling, and his writing about it is almost scandalously knowledgeable. Money did what it always does; youngsters stormed stables for the chance to ride, and they quickly learned that since winning alone counted, nothing was too vicious to be prohibited in competition. Unlike some modern Olympians, they didn't drug themselves, they doped horses, and if one dropped dead at the gate, newspapers made jokes about it. Dizikes says conflicting interests of owners, trainers and jockeys, all of them gamblers, introduced special ambiguities into racing. Well, sure. But a reader now, seeing the Internet turn betting pools into oceans around all sports, can locate ambiguity anywhere he likes. Dizikes's real point is that if people making bets didn't like results, jockeys took the blame, and the better the jockey the worse the retribution.</p>
        <p>When Sloan was 5, in 1879, his mother died and his father fostered him out to another family, but he was soon a boy vagabond and tried a lot of rough jobs before he became a stablehand at 14. In 1893 he began racing in California, where his winning record made him a local legend. In 1896 he moved to the big tracks of New York and national notoriety. In its account of him, the Racing Hall of Fame says he won nearly 30 percent of his races in 1896, 37 percent in 1897 and 46 percent in 1898 (20 percent was a good average for the best riders in the country). In 1899, in each of three six-race events in two countries, he won five out of the six. He would often win on a horse that everyone else shunned, and he had an incomparable awareness of the whole field in any race, which made him a fearsome strategist. In any history of racing, Sloan's figures jump off the page.</p>
        <p>In those days racing was like poetry; to get top laurels you had to win in London. Sloan went over for two months each in 1897 and 1898 and spent the entire racing season there in the next two years. He created a sensation that looks comical now. Jockeys always rode like everyone else, on the horse's back. Sloan, using very short stirrups, crouched up on the withers and craned out over the animal's neck. He did not invent the style -- New York sportswriters called it ''western'' -- but London writers, giddy with ridicule, tagged him with it, and cartoonists made him a spectacle the public couldn't get enough of. Given his winning record, British jockeys could resist imitating him for only a couple of years. Ever since, all jockeys ride like Tod Sloan.</p>
        <p>British racing was ruled by the nobility, men who in the century then ending had lost their hereditary right to run the kingdom and its empire. Sloan's celebrity, and his easy democratic familiarity, were more upsetting than, say, the eminence of Henry James in a different kind of game. Moreover, Sloan's success drew boatloads of Americans to British tracks -- jockeys, trainers and gamblers. Then, in 1900, the Prince of Wales asked Sloan to ride for his stable the next year and, with Queen Victoria known to be dying, in noble nightmares Sloan thundered past wearing the king's colors.</p>
        <p>So the Jockey Club of Newmarket disciplined the American invasion by decapitating it. The club had ruled racing since 1752 (still does; see its Web site). In 1900 its 100 members were bluebloods who decided in secret and never explained; everyone in racing needed a license from them and their rulings were honored by racing authorities throughout the world. The club fastened on Sloan's violation of two prohibitions in one race: betting on himself and taking a cash gift. British jockeys had done both with impunity and the club had no more evidence that Sloan's bets affected his race than the major leagues ever had that Pete Rose's betting affected his performance in baseball. But the bluebloods knew the value of humiliation and knew they could count on Sloan's ferocious American competitors in racing to multiply it. In December the Jockey Club announced that Sloan ''need not apply for a license to ride'' the next year. The order was never withdrawn. Sloan was 26.</p>
        <p>In the years that followed, Oscar Hammerstein set him up in a one-man Broadway show, but he hated it. He was married twice and divorced twice. He ran gambling parlors in Paris and New York. He did a few degrading scenes in films. Damon Runyon saw him taking patrons' tickets at a Tijuana track shortly before he died of cirrhosis in 1933. Now, outside racing, who recognizes his name? It is as though in his free fall he dropped out of history. But, as Dizikes reminds us, that never really happens; millions of us know a thing or two about Tod Sloan without knowing who it is we know them about.</p>
        <p>British racing historians were the first to restore his reputation, crediting him with a benign revolution in their ancient sport, and he is generally more honored there than here. For instance, a few dictionaries still give his first name as a noun meaning in-your-face independence -- an admiring Cockney coinage of 1899. In 1900 American papers gave him little comfort and many in racing cheered his downfall. As Dizikes says, here there is no sympathy for a loser on the fast track, ''only contempt.'' He quotes just enough of the contemporary reaction to Sloan's fall to give its flavor; some of the racing luminaries sound just like Silicon Valley crybaby billionaires cheering on the government to hobble the one competitor they can't catch up with on their track.</p>
        <p>Dizikes is wary of America's favorite romance: the victimization of celebrity or success. But he does allow that Sloan was a victim of resentment against democratization of sports. Good strategy; having mentioned that, he doesn't have to prod readers to think about this postdemocratic age when the superstars, the sports, the Olympics, are parts of global corporate enterprises trying to manipulate, and satisfy, a public that simply assumes the validity of its every sovereign judgment about everything. There is an early hint in this book that our certainty, and the harshness that goes with it, spring from our Puritan history. It is quite unnerving to find your reading interrupted by thoughts about what connects that most dour Reformation theologian, John Calvin, with Tod Sloan, Diamond Jim Brady, Pete Rose and Judy Garland. But this is that kind of book. It pulls things together in your mind you thought you'd forgotten.</p>
        <p>You will not forget Tod Sloan -- especially after a final short chapter called ''Stories,'' in which Dizikes reminds you how deep Sloan is in our cultural memory. There is Hemingway's story ''My Old Man,'' absorbed by generations of college students. Dizikes explains how Sloan is both characters in it: the puzzled boy trying to discover the source of his father's shame, and the defeated father who cannot reveal it. (The physical connection Dizikes traces between the literary lights of the Lost Generation and Sloan is a fine tribute to the benevolence of sheer chance.)</p>
        <p>More important in this story of memory is Sloan's slightly younger friend George M. Cohan, who in 1904 took the lead in his own musical ''Little Johnny Jones'' -- recognizably the Tod Sloan story but with a happy ending. It is Little Johnny, the Sloan character, who sings the most enduring of all Broadway anthems, ''Give my regards to . . .'' The musical is not very memorable, but in 1942, the year Cohan died, Warner Brothers released ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' a film biography of Cohan that for the past 20 years has appeared a few times every month on cable television in one part of this country or another. There, in the big production number, is James Cagney playing Cohan playing Little Johnny, singing: ''Yankee Doodle went to London / Just to ride the ponies.'' When the musical was staged no playbill or newspaper would have dared explain who went to ride the ponies, for fear of getting a raspberry from the public; everyone in the country knew. It is decent of Dizikes to let us know again.</p>
