        <p>Big Foot needs a coat.</p>
        <p>It's like that every autumn for him because he spends his time drinking instead of obsessing about the frivolities of life.</p>
        <p>He also needs gloves and boots. His hands are thin and shaky. His feet are size 15 1/2 and hang over the sides of his sandals. He walks with a cane and sleeps where he pleases.</p>
        <p>Big Foot is sitting on a plastic milk crate on the corner of St. Marks Place and First Avenue and is joined by Hambone Tommy, the pie-eyed orator, and David Russell, the professor of garbology.</p>
        <p>On the north side of St. Marks is the Holiday Cocktail Lounge, owned by Stephan Lutak, a silver-haired old Ukrainian. When the rains are especially cold, like tonight, Big Foot will wander into the dark saloon, and without a word, Stephan will pour him a shot of the hard stuff, no charge. But the Ukrainian has banned Big Foot tonight, accusing him of stealing a light bulb from the toilet.</p>
        <p>''What the hell am I going to do with a light bulb?'' Big Foot would really like to know. ''I'm a chief, not a thief.''</p>
        <p>Big Foot's true name is Merrith Stops at Pretty Places. He is a 43-year-old Crow Indian from the Wyola reservation in Montana, and has been a popular totem on this East Village corner for the past 20 years. He has the long, elegant face of a wolf. He wears his hair pulled back and tied down and a large chrome-plated Buffalo nickel on his chest.</p>
        <p>He will drink a gallon of fortified wine if it suits him. He keeps his bottle in a brown paper bag tucked in his milk crate.</p>
        <p>''The stuff's destroying him,'' Mr. Russell says in a sad Glaswegian brogue. ''Alcohol is no laughing matter, me boy. It'll eat you up.''</p>
        <p>Big Foot is anemic. He has a bum leg, a bad liver and a faulty bladder. He recently spent a month in Cabrini Medical Center after checking in with a distended stomach. They pumped 12 liters of fluid from his guts and put in two pints of blood.</p>
        <p>''It was warm in the hospital,'' Big Foot remembers.</p>
        <p>The topic of conversation turns to morose tales of hypothermia and gangrene, stories of men passing out under bridges and losing their limbs or stumbling along the highways and falling into snowdrifts.  To a man, they talk about faulty fathers and battered mothers and larders stocked with whiskey.</p>
        <p>''Geez, I'm getting cold out here,'' Big Foot says before taking a swallow. The wine makes him warm and satisfied and at moments like this he is one of the friendliest men on the block. People give him bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russell would rather pick trash than panhandle. He knows you can move a woman to tears by permitting her to see you eating grass in her front yard, but he just doesn't have it in him.</p>
        <p>''I've found everything I need in these bins, you name it, I've found it,'' the hobo says.</p>
        <p>''How 'bout size 15 1/2 boots?'' Big Foot asks somewhat hopefully.</p>
        <p>''Nope, come to think of it, I've never found that.''</p>
