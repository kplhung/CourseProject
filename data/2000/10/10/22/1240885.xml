        <p>If Chevron follows through with its acquisition of Texaco, what will happen to Texaco's 770,000-square-foot headquarters in Harrison?</p>
        <p>''It's probably one of the best pieces of property in Westchester,'' said Dean J. Shapiro, the executive director of Insignia/ESG, a commercial real estate company in Stamford. ''So we're discussing its highest and best use.''</p>
        <p>Could the lush 107-acre campus, which is next door to Purchase, be used for upscale homes? Probably not, because the land is zoned for commercial, not residential, use, Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
        <p>What about revamping the building for multiple tenants? That would be difficult, because each floor in the building is 171,000 square feet. Optimally, Mr. Shapiro said, floor sizes should be no more than 40,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>An educational or health institution might want the building, and another corporate giant might take it over. Its market value depends on its use, but it could be as high as $100 million.</p>
        <p>''That's a big number,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''But it's a big building.''</p>
