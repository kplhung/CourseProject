        <p>AL PACINO'S character in THE INSIDER (1999) is a little too nobly heroic at times, but the film in enthralling. Mr. Pacino stars as the ''60 Minutes'' producer who puts some appalling truths about the tobacco industry on national television. Russell Crowe plays the whistle-blower, a former Brown &amp; Williamson scientist who agrees to spill secrets and soon finds himself the target of death threats. Christopher Plummer is uncannily on the mark as the newsman Mike Wallace. And the beauty of the story is that it's all about integrity, its values and dangers, but never treats it as an absolute. The film received Oscar nominations in seven categories, including best director (Michael Mann) and best picture. CBS plays the villain - Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 3:45 a.m. on Starz!</p>

        <p>Maybe Steven Soderbergh was just too young to know any better when he made SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE (1989), which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. That would explain his stark, brazenly self-assured direction at the age of 26 and the uniformly pure performances it brought forth. Andie MacDowell is a beautiful but frigid young wife; Peter Gallagher is her husband, a lawyer having an affair with her more extroverted sister; and James Spader is his old college pal who comes to visit and shakes up everyone's lives. A camera is at the center of Mr. Spader's character's solitary love life, but these people don't need videotape to do their distancing and objectifying - Sunday at 12:15 p.m., Sunday/Early Monday 2:15 a.m. and Saturday at 11 p.m. on Sundance.</p>
        <p>Glenda Jackson was the leading lady of the moment when she starred in A TOUCH OF CLASS (1973), directed by Melvin Frank, and won her second best-actress Oscar for it. She's a London fashion designer and George Segal is the married American businessman who whisks her away to Malta and a long-term affair. The film's portrayal of casual adultery as innocent recreation was an idea whose time had come, so this is a romantic comedy, wry and charming. But in the end everybody suffers - Thursday at 6:05 p.m. on Romance Classics.</p>
        <p>Fans of westerns in the ''Rio Bravo'' style will find all their favorite elements in EL DORADO (1967), from Howard Hawks's twilight years. Not to mention two huge movie stars teamed for the first time. John Wayne, 60 at the time, plays the fastest hired gun in the west. Robert Mitchum, 50, is an old friend of his, a sheriff with a drinking problem. Arhtur Hunnicutt is his lively geezer of a deputy, and James Caan plays the cocky young newcomer who can't shoot straight. They're all up against an evil rancher and his men. The film is laconic, funny and, in its fading Technicolor way, tough - Sunday at 9:45 p.m., Sunday/Early Monday at 2:15 a.m. on AMC.</p>
        <p>Not a single human being turns into a cat in THE CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE (1944), directed by Robert Wise and Cunther von Fritsch. Despite its title, the film is not a horror movie or even a psychological thriller - although there is a demented neighbor and some scary Headless Horseman material. This sequel in name only is a gentle, charming fantasy about a lonely 6-year-old girl (Ann Carter) and her seemingly imaginary friend (Simone Simon, one of several stars from the original ''Cat People''). Kent Smith plays the little girl's disbelieving father, who, as it turns out, knows the imaginary friend well - Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 13.</p>
