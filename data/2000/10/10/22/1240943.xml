        <p>The principal of P.S. 3, a highly regarded, progressive school in Greenwich Village, was fired late Friday afternoon, angering many parents and teachers, who vowed to challenge the decision.</p>
        <p>The principal, Kate Unger, who started eight weeks ago at the school, at 490 Hudson Street (at Grove Street), was dismissed in a closed-door meeting with Shelley Harwayne, acting superintendent of District 2, and other officials. Roy Moskowitz, a special counsel to the district, declined to explain the circumstances of the firing, saying, ''There will be no comments about the meeting because it involves a personnel matter.''</p>
        <p>Parents said the firing had little to do with Ms. Unger's performance. They say it was motivated by the Board of Education's effort to do away with the unorthodox teaching methods, which include mixing students of different grades in classes. Also known as the Melser Charette School, the school has about 500 students and has had four principals during the last six years.</p>
        <p>''Parents, teachers and kids loved her,'' said Gerri Wells, the parent of a 6-year-old girl who attends the school. ''There's a move to make P.S. 3 into a clone school and have everything the same.''</p>
        <p>The school was formed in 1971 by parents and community advocates to be an arts-based alternative school that invites close participation by parents. Among other things, parents meet weekly with the principal to discuss matters like curriculum, class size and after-school programs.</p>
        <p>''As a gay parent, it's a very open and accepting school,'' said Kathy Yaccarino, president of the parent association. ''They are very proactive in fighting racism and bigotry.''</p>
        <p>A tearful Ms. Unger emerged from the two-hour meeting to face about 30 parents who had descended on the district offices at 333 Seventh Avenue to protest the dismissal.  ''It's mysterious because I was very clear about who I am,'' Ms. Unger said. ''It seems there was a problem with what I brought to the table.''</p>
        <p>Parents said they would fight the firing and would march to the district offices tomorrow in protest.</p>
