        <p>SINCE the dress code was relaxed a few months ago at the Katharine Gibbs School in Melville, stockings are no longer mandatory. Shoulders don't have to be covered. Sandals, but not sneakers, can be worn instead of pumps. Guys can sport T-shirts; ties are no longer necessary. Along with the new informality, purple hair and piercings, even tattoos, have begun showing up on students in the hallways.</p>
        <p>Though business casual is now the rule, Diane Engelhardt, 44, president of the Long Island branch of the 89-year-old career training institution, hasn't been able to shed the school of its prim and proper image. And she's not certain she really wants to.</p>
        <p>''Gibbs has definitely changed,'' Ms. Engelhardt said recently, wearing a gray suit, not the school's signature navy blue skirt look, and waffling over the dress code issue. ''Katharine Gibbs used to be the finishing school, a white glove type of school,'' she said. ''Over the years we've become more diverse. We don't want to lose that tradition of Katharine Gibbs. Now the word is out there that we are just not secretarial anymore. But we also don't want to lose the sense of who we were and how we got to this point.''</p>
        <p>The move out of the strictly secretarial box is not just about clothes. It began three and a half years ago when the school, one of the seven Gibbs locations in the Northeast, was purchased by the Illinois-based Career Education Corporation. Learning to answer the phone and keyboarding were no longer enough. To stay on the cutting edge, new programs in computer technical support, computer network operations and graphic design were added, supplementing the traditional mix of classes for legal, medical and executive office assistants.</p>
        <p>''We started to be not only diversified in offering a different type of program, but we also attracted a different person to the program,'' Ms. Engelhardt said, referring to the sex, not background, of the ''predominantly white, middle class'' student body. Prior to the takeover, only 1 to 2 percent of Gibbs students were male.</p>
        <p>This fall, total enrollment is evenly divided, though the computer programs are 80 percent male. And the overall numbers are up. In 1997, Gibbs on Long Island had 250 students. For the current quarter, which began Oct. 10, about 900 students are registered and adults outnumber recent high school grads by three to one.</p>
        <p>The school operates on a year-round, four-quarter 11-week block schedule, offering 18-month degree programs and 9-month certificates with little flexibility in class choice, admitting recent high school graduates in July and October and adults throughout the year. Tuition for associate degree programs is $19,374. Certificate programs cost $9,840. Gibbs is accredited as a business school by the Washington-based Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. Programs and degrees are approved by the New York State Board of Regents.</p>
        <p>In July, Gibbs inaugurated an associates degree in applied science in digital arts and animation at a new Plainview facility that will lead to jobs in new media, film and television. And in response to a local employer survey, new curriculums in e-commerce and Web design are also in the works.</p>
        <p>Though only a third of the students now take office administration, secretarial skills remain the Gibbs hallmark. Katharine Gibbs, a single mother in Providence, R.I., founded the school in 1911. The idea, Ms. Engelhardt said, was to help young single mothers acquire skills so they could get jobs in the work force to support themselves.</p>
        <p>When she started at Gibbs in the 1970's, Ms. Engelhardt, a Woodbury woman who taught previously at the City University of New York, taught shorthand, keyboarding, accounting and secretarial procedures. These days, she said, students still learn proper phone etiquette (multiple lines can be quite confusing), use copiers and fax machines, file alphabetically and geographically, greet visitors and make travel arrangements for the boss.</p>
        <p>But shorthand has been replaced by speedwriting -- a slower method of taking dictation, where the t's aren't crossed and the i's aren't dotted -- and students also take speech, management and accounting classes. And no one wants to be called a secretary anymore.</p>
        <p>''The name denotes, 'Oh I have to get the coffee for the boss and I have to do this' and that's not really what it's all about,'' Ms. Engelhardt said, preferring executive assistant or office technology administrator. ''The traditional secretary has disappeared. The secretary of today, that office manager, runs the company, and that's the first impression the client gets, whether it's a phone call or greeting a person.''</p>
        <p>''This is the person that organizes their supervisor in the sense that they take care of the mail, their memos, their letter writing; they really handle that person,'' Ms. Engelhardt said, wishing that she had a secretary of her own.</p>
        <p>In fact, there is such a shortage of secretarial help on the Island that Jim Swift, director of career services and corporate training at the in-house Gibbs Agency, said the school was trying to draw more students back into those areas.</p>
        <p>''We place them faster than any of the other programs,'' he said. ''There is always a need for them.''</p>
        <p>Total placement rates hover about 93 percent and calls start pouring in from local companies like Computer Associates in Islandia and Marchon Eyewear in Melville two weeks before graduation. New York City companies also draw from Gibbs's grad pool.</p>
        <p>Piercings and dyed hair aren't allowed on interviews, leg tattoos must be covered with stockings and that navy blue suit is strongly suggested.</p>
        <p>Upon graduating from high school in Brooklyn, Ms. Engelhardt said, she yearned to go away to college. Her parents wanted her to become a secretary. She compromised by attending Kingsborough Community College, then City University of New York's Baruch College, eventually earning a doctorate of education in office technology and teaching administrative procedures.</p>
        <p>''They felt I would have the skills if I couldn't get a teaching job I could go out and become a secretary,'' she said. Were they right?</p>
        <p>Well, yes. ''The skills paid off,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Just take a look at Gibbs's Options program for people returning to work, changing careers or trying to get a foot in the corporate door. The intensive three-month training course in office technology and basic office skills includes keyboarding, word processing, spreadsheets and developing professional business habits.</p>
        <p>''We get students who graduated from college,'' she said. ''They majored in history or they majored in English and they went on the job and  guess what? The first thing they had to do was take a typing test. And guess what? They can't type.''</p>
        <p>New Tilles Playbills</p>
        <p>Theater-goers in the city stuff playbills in their pockets and jump into taxis when a performance ends. Not Long Islanders. Walking to their cars, patrons of the Tilles Center this season will be toting copies of CenterStage, a full-size, 64-page magazine.</p>
        <p>The new publication is the first arts magazine on the Island, said Elliot Sroka, executive editor and executive director of Tilles, the performing arts center on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville.  ''It's very tied, that smaller format that we always used, with the world of the city,'' Mr. Sroka said. The change in playbill format follows a trend among performing art magazines on the West Coast, numerous symphonies and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.</p>
        <p>''It tends to be particularly popular in suburban markets where people are driving in a car,'' Mr. Sroka said at a splashy launch party for the new magazine held at the Garden City Hotel recently. ''In the suburbs there has been more interest in a broader publication, something that had more space.''</p>
        <p>And larger print. Tilles's old playbills ran 86 to 90 pages. With several events listed in each edition, information was crammed in. The new program notes will be printed nine times a year, features stories will change three times. The first edition contains an interview with Billy Taylor, the jazz artist, and articles on the violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and the Tilles Center's 20th anniversary.</p>
        <p>Attending a show to get a copy won't be necessary. CenterStage will be distributed at libraries, universities, shops and through the mail.</p>
        <p>''This is modern life,'' Mr. Sroka said. ''It's a visual world we are living in now. We are trying to interest younger people in the arts. If we keep doing our classical music in stuffy-looking little publications with tiny print, we are missing something in terms of the potential to reach a larger audience.''</p>
