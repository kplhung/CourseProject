        <p>FOR the past decade, irate residents of this city have been complaining of a mounting pollution problem that has on occasion led health officials to declare such world-famous beaches as Copacabana and Ipanema unfit for swimming. But now, with the Southern Hemisphere summer tourist season fast approaching, authorities are investing heavily in public works projects intended to improve the water quality of those and other beaches.</p>
        <p>The effort comes after a series of spectacular mishaps led to a public outcry here last summer. In the space of just a few weeks, the Rio coastline was blighted by raw sewage spewing into popular swimming areas, unsightly parasite-infested sea formations known locally as black tongues, an oil spill in Guanabara Bay, a massive die-off of fish in the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, and body parts of murder victims washing up on popular beaches.</p>
        <p>''What I can say with absolute certainty is that the beaches are being worked on so that this summer we can have a good summer along the whole length of the seashore,'' said Nilo Felix, the Rio representative of Embratur, the Brazilian government tourism agency. But David Zee, a professor of oceanography at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, warns that ''just because things are without a doubt improving does not mean the problem has been resolved.'' Another three to four years of public works will be required, he says, ''before we can say that the beaches here will be much better.''</p>
        <p>For now, Dr. Zee recommends a number of precautions for residents and tourists. Beachgoers should not enter the water at all if a white or yellow spume is visible, he said, and should also be suspicious when the water appears to be dark green or brown. Waders in the water up to their waists should be able to see their feet, he added, and cooler water is preferable to warmer because it comes from the depths of the sea.</p>
        <p>Beachgoers should also refrain from going into the water at all for at least two days after a heavy rain. he said, to avoid the sewage and garbage that flow down untreated into the ocean from Rocinha and Vidigal, two huge favelas, or squatter settlements, on mountainsides overlooking some of Rio's most exclusive neighborhoods and beaches, among them Ipanema and Leblon.</p>
        <p>''If I had a tourist friend, I would recommend Copacabana and Leme beaches,'' Dr. Zee said. ''But I wouldn't go to Ipanema or Leblon because of the canals that carry the sewage out to sea there.'' He would definitely avoid Sao Conrado, he said, where fecal coliform levels run as high as 2,400 particles per 100 milliliters of marine water, more than twice the permissible level. (The Environmental Protection Agency recommendation in the United States, when measurements were still done this way, was for an average of 200 particles per 100 milliliters.)</p>
        <p>But government officials argue that political grandstanding has exaggerated concerns about pollution in a year of municipal elections.</p>
        <p>''If the situation is as serious as the press says, where are the epidemics?'' asked Alberto Jose Mendes Gomes, president of the state water and sewage authority. ''We kept the beaches monitored, and at no time were people at any risk. In fact, I have never stopped going to the beach myself.''</p>
        <p>The effort to expand the capacity of Rio's sewage system, which Mr. Gomes compared to repairing an airplane while it is in full flight, includes a widening of canals and installation of more powerful pumps, but its main focus is expanding and strengthening the pipeline that disposes sewage nearly three miles out at sea. Completion of the project has been delayed until early next year, though, as a result of a recent accident on a maritime platform off Ipanema.</p>
        <p>''This is a maintenance problem that has nothing to do with pollution, but rather with the pillars that support the pipeline,'' said Gerard Bourgeaiseau, director of Riotur, the municipal tourist commission. ''The delay is not polluting the beaches in any way, and I want to stress that point.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, Rio has rapidly grown westward, expanding into the Barra da Tijuca area, which has had some of the most magnificent beaches in the metropolitan area. But since that zone does not yet have a sewage system or treatment plant, the explosive population growth has resulted in a marked deterioration in the quality of both sea water and sand.</p>
        <p>''The Barra da Tijuca does not at the moment have the kind of coverage that exists in Ipanema and Copacabana, but we are going to be spending $200 million in the next couple of years so that it will,'' Mr. Gomes said. ''Everything should be in place by 2002, but until then whatever problems we are talking about have more to do with the environment than public health, and do not affect the useability of the beach.''</p>
        <p>Yet even when all the sewage and drainage systems are fully in place across the city, Dr. Zee cautioned, the problem of sand polluted by parasites will linger. To avoid problems, he recommends finding a place on the shore close to the sea, where there is  a cleansing effect on contaminated sand, or simply sitting on a beach chair.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bourgeaiseau minimized those and other concerns, saying that scientists are asking for perfection.</p>
        <p>''I'm not suicidal and there are times I don't go in the water,'' he said. ''But I can go for a dip with any tourist at any beach.''</p>
