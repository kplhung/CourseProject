        <p>DAVID ARMAND CAPUTO, a Fulbright scholar and the past president of Hunter College, was installed on Wednesday as the sixth president of Pace University.</p>
        <p>Dr. Caputo succeeds Patricia O. Ewers as president of the 92-year-old university, which has more than 13,000 students at five campuses in New York City and Westchester.</p>
        <p>''I've not taken over a troubled university, although I do want to increase its visibility and move it into a higher tier of major universities,'' Dr. Caputo said in an interview before his installation.</p>
        <p>A 1965 graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Dr. Caputo received a Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship and earned two master's degrees and a Ph.D. in political science from Yale University.</p>
        <p>He said he wanted to increase the number of full-time faculty at the university -- of Pace's 1,000 faculty members, 59 percent are part-time -- give more honors and opportunities to top students and broaden community input.</p>
        <p>In line with the latter goal, Pace is building a $15 million training institute for judges who want a better understanding of changing issues in today's courtroom, like domestic violence. It will be only the second judiciary school in the nation, the first being the National Judicial College of Reno.</p>
        <p>''It's a nice blend between academia and the real world,'' Dr. Caputo said of the judicial institute.</p>
        <p>As a hands-on administrator, Dr. Caputo said he enjoys meeting with students and listening to their concerns.</p>
        <p>During a recent overnight visit to one of Pace's dormitories, he observed that students today were concerned with how they would fit into the larger economic community when they graduated.</p>
        <p>''They're bottom-line oriented,'' he said. ''They're interested in the world at large, and they're competitive.''</p>
        <p>Pace, which has traditionally attracted students who are the first-generation offspring of immigrants and often the first in their families to attend college, was founded in 1906 by Homer and Charles Pace, two brothers who borrowed $600 to rent a classroom and office space.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging the advances since then as well as the anticipated technological changes ahead, Dr. Caputo predicted that ''the decade ahead  will be one of great transformation.''</p>
        <p>''Some schools will become virtual universities, some will stay with the traditional approach,'' he said. ''Those are the extremes. To succeed, we'll need to incorporate a variety of methods.''</p>
        <p>The changes, however, are not being dictated solely by technology, he said. The traditional student, as colleges have known them in the past, have also changed, and those seeking higher education today ''want it on their own terms.''</p>
        <p>''College students work, they have families,'' Dr. Caputo said, ''and we will have to be responsive to that.''</p>
        <p>As of this fall, Pace reported an enrollment of 13,331 students representing 78 countries. It has 8,132 students at its Manhattan campus, 3,260 in Pleasantville and 1,939 in White Plains.</p>
        <p>In the coming decade, Dr. Caputo said, he would address the need to double the university's $100 million endowment.</p>
        <p>With a budget of more than $186 million a year, the college is dependent for its operating expenses on the $15,870 annual tuition, which is significantly higher than the tuition at state-supported schools but less than the annual tuition, for example, at New York University, which is $24,336.</p>
        <p>''We're about in the middle for private schools,'' Dr. Caputo said. By comparison, Iona College in New Rochelle charges $15,500, and Fordham's tuition is $20,200.</p>
        <p>But for a school that attracts many students from working-class families, Pace cannot depend solely on large gifts from graduates.</p>
        <p>''That they give is more important than how much they give,'' he said.</p>
