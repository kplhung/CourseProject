        <p>MR. WROE'S VIRGINS, by Jane Rogers. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) This fact-based novel tells of the self-proclaimed prophet John Wroe (1782-1863), who persuaded his congregation to give him seven virgins for ''comfort and succor'' as servants in his Lancashire mansion. ''Rogers has conjured an engaging, serious and gleefully ironic novel, one that leaps headlong into the most ambitious and risky territories: faith, love and existential meaning,'' Kathryn Harrison wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>THE BLACK ROOM AT LONGWOOD: Napoleon's Exile on Saint Helena, by Jean-Paul Kauffmann. (Four Walls Eight Windows, $14.95.) A French magazine writer, recording a week spent in Napoleon's final home, provides an elegant, obsessive meditation on the impoverished reality of captivity. ''Kauffmann's bittersweet book is an inquiry into the mechanics of remembrance and regret,'' W. S. Di Piero said here in 1999. ''What he finds at Longwood is a rotting diorama, a monument to time as torture.''</p>
        <p>THE TINY ONE, by Eliza Minot. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) Via Revere, this novel's precocious 8-year-old narrator, displays a variety of voices, from childlike to teenage to nearly grown-up, as she recalls in minute detail the events surrounding her mother's death in a car accident. ''Minot has a sharp eye, a great ear and a terrific memory,'' Jeffrey Eugenides wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>GOTHAM: A History of New York City to 1898, by Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace. (Oxford University, $24.95.) Two history professors at the City University of New York march from prehistory to the Dutch settlement to the consolidation of the boroughs. Their huge narrative, crammed with facts and oddities, won a Pulitzer Prize. ''Burrows and Wallace offer a large-canvas portrait of a city they clearly love,'' Clyde Haberman wrote here in 1998.</p>
        <p>GAP CREEK, by Robert Morgan. (Scribner, $13.) Set in the North Carolina back country at the turn of the century, this novel features penniless characters repeatedly stung by bad luck as they care for their ill and go about the backbreaking physical labor that allows them to survive the winter. ''At their finest,'' Dwight Garner said here last year, Morgan's ''stripped-down and almost primitive sentences burn with the raw, lonesome pathos of Hank Williams's best songs.'' Scribner has also reissued The Blue Valleys: A Collection of Stories ($11), in which Morgan explores the hardscrabble lives of working folks in the Blue Ridge Mountains from Civil War times to the present. The result is ''a procession of tales rich with native detail and character, told in language as plain and deep as the hills,'' Joanne Kennedy wrote in these pages in 1989.</p>
        <p>CRUDDY: An Illustrated Novel, by Lynda Barry. (Scribner, $12.) Roberta Rohbeson is a 16-year-old girl whose ghastly home life and cross-country trip with her father, an unemployed meatcutter who goes berserk, leads her to the brink of suicide. ''The author's ability to capture the paralyzing bleakness of despair, and her uncanny ear for dialogue, make this first novel a work of terrible beauty,'' Alanna Nash wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>MY MOVIE BUSINESS: A Memoir, by John Irving. (Ballantine, $12.95.) In recounting his personal history of seeing his novels made -- or not made -- into movies, the author of ''The Cider House Rules'' (which won the author an Oscar for best adapted screenplay) explains how turning a book into a film involves a long series of compromises that a writer tries to make artistically valid. ''The book digresses charmingly and effortlessly into related subjects,'' William Boyd wrote here last year. ''His tone throughout . . . is measured and genial.''</p>
        <p>STRANGE BEAUTY: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in Twentieth-Century Physics, by George Johnson. (Vintage, $15.) This balanced biography portrays the Nobel Prize-winning scientist as a brilliant but tormented man who dominated elementary particle physics in the heady 1950's and 60's. ''He appears as a flawed, almost Shakespearean hero,'' Louis A. Bloomfield said here in 1999. ''Johnson does a wonderful job of describing the competition and cooperation among scientists, the egos and insecurities, the disappointments and triumphs.''</p>
        <p>TO SEE AND SEE AGAIN: A Life in Iran and America, by Tara Bahrampour. (University of California, $17.95.) The daughter of an American mother and Iranian father describes her Westernized childhood in Tehran and her life as an exile after the fall of the shah. Last year our reviewer, Adrienne Edgar, called this ''a fascinating, often moving, account of her life on the boundary between two very different cultures.''</p>
