        <p>Plowing through the tax plans of the Senate candidates in New York, it is easy to get bogged down in the arcane details, to be distracted by the mind-boggling billions of dollars involved, or to be lulled by the mind-numbing slogans employed on both sides. (Protect Social Security! Pay down the national debt!)</p>
        <p>Boiled down to their essentials, however, the candidates' proposals reveal stark differences in their attitudes about taxes, and even their philosophies about government, tax experts say. For Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrat, tax cuts are a means to an end. For Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican, tax cuts are an end in themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has proposed several sweeping changes to the tax code, which he believes will put ''more of New Yorkers' hard-earned money where it belongs: in their pockets,'' as he said last month in a speech in Brooklyn. These general tax cuts, he says, will also create jobs and encourage investment.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, focuses her tax cuts more narrowly, to benefit people in certain circumstances -- with disabled relatives, say, or children in college -- or to try to achieve goals like igniting economic growth in upstate New York. More general tax cuts, she says, would be reckless and would squander the federal budget surplus.</p>
        <p>Where the candidates seem to agree -- in their opposition to the so-called marriage tax penalty on two-income couples and to heavy taxes on the estates of the dead -- they differ sharply in their solutions. Mr. Lazio proposes eliminating estate taxes and the marriage penalty; Mrs. Clinton suggests smaller changes that would mitigate the tax burden for the less well-to-do.</p>
        <p>The candidates' emphasis on tax cuts has been unusual for a Senate race in New York, where voters have not generally been perceived as clamoring for tax relief, at least on the federal level.</p>
        <p>State and local taxes are a different matter, of course. Despite the Pataki administration's cuts, the state and local tax burden in New York is the second highest in the country, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research group in Washington. That helps push the total tax burden in the state, as a percentage of income, to third in the nation, after Connecticut and Wyoming.</p>
        <p>But New Yorkers' heavy tax burden also stems from the state's concentration of very wealthy taxpayers. Because of the high cost of living in the southern part of the state, the definition of wealthy is different in New York from what it is in other parts of the country. Nevertheless, according to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group, 2 percent of the state's taxpayers earn more than $200,000 a year and make about half of the state's annual federal tax payment.</p>
        <p>Despite the unusual features of New York's tax situation, the candidates' positions largely echo the traditional approaches of their political parties.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's plan is like those proposed by her husband and by Vice President Al Gore in his presidential campaign. ''It's classic Democratic social policy,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ''There's a heavy tilt toward low-income working poor and the lower end of the middle class, helping people with particular needs, larger social needs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's proposals, though similar to those backed by other Republicans in Congress, are quite different from the policy of George W. Bush, who advocates a general rollback of income tax rates. (The top rate, for example, would go to 33 percent from 39.6 percent.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has instead supported a change that he contends would be as helpful to middle-income taxpayers without breaking the bank: making Social Security tax payments deductible for those in the two lowest tax brackets (including married couples who make up to $106,000 a year). He also advocates cutting the tax on capital gains, a change that, along with the elimination of the estate tax, would primarily benefit wealthier taxpayers with large investment portfolios.</p>
        <p>That has prompted Mrs. Clinton's staff to argue that Mr. Lazio's tax cuts are, in fact, as ''targeted'' as hers -- but aimed mostly at richer taxpayers. The Citizens for Tax Justice, a left-leaning Washington research group, calculates that 30 percent of his tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, those who make an average of $915,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Albany, dismissed Mr. Lazio's tax proposals as ''basically the Republican Congressional tax plan.''</p>
        <p>''To say that by addressing the marriage penalty you are going to be addressing economic development in upstate New York is a leap,'' Mr. Mauro said. ''It's preposterous.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has focused much of her campaign on upstate New York, where economic growth, though improving, has been slower than in the southern part of the state, or in much of the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>Among many proposals she has made for improving the economy upstate are tax credits of $3,000 per job for small businesses that locate in economically distressed areas. Mr. Lazio supports a $1,000 job-creation tax credit, but has generally emphasized broad tax cuts as the way to spur economic growth.</p>
        <p>Whether such tax credits truly make a difference is a matter of debate among economists and people in the economic development business. Consultants who help big businesses decide where to locate say that although tax incentives can be important, they are usually outweighed by other factors, like transportation, the available work force, and even quality of life.</p>
        <p>Some critics contend that so-called targeted tax cuts or credits just make the tax code more complicated, and do not work anyway. ''With targeted tax cuts, you usually find they miss their mark,'' said Tom E. McClusky, senior policy analyst for the National Taxpayers Union in Washington.</p>
        <p>That conservative group, which has endorsed Mr. Lazio's tax plan, contends that Mrs. Clinton's various tax and budget proposals would increase federal spending by $242 billion a year, while Mr. Lazio's would increase spending by $39 billion.</p>
        <p>Like most numbers that get tossed around in the discussion about taxes and the federal budget, these are not entirely reliable. For example, the group estimates that Mrs. Clinton would spend more than $75 billion a year to pay down the national debt; Mr. Lazio also favors reducing the national debt, but no such spending is included in his tally.</p>
        <p>Retirement plans are another area in which the candidates clearly differ. Mrs. Clinton has recently endorsed a plan, modeled on Mr. Gore's, that would give tax credits to people who make less than $100,000 a year and put money away in special retirement savings accounts. Her plan limits the amount of money individuals can invest to $1,000 a year, rather than Mr. Gore's $2,000, and would cost about $120 billion over a decade, according to her campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has proposed increasing the amount of money Americans can put into individual retirement accounts to $5,000 a year, from $2,000 today, and increasing the cap in line with inflation. His plan would cost about $54 billion over a decade, according to his campaign.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, it is the candidates' philosophies that will matter, rather than the details of anything they propose during the campaign, analysts of all stripes agree. After all, a junior senator from either party is unlikely to be setting the nation's tax policies any time soon.</p>
        <p>The new senator's role ''certainly won't be as significant as the person they are replacing,'' said Bill Ahern, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, referring to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring. ''You have to be on the Finance Committee and relatively senior to have a real impact on federal tax policy.''</p>
        <p>The first article in this series examined the positions of the Senate candidates in New York on education.</p>
