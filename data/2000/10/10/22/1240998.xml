        <p>One brutal October morning on Wall Street -- why does that phrase seem so familiar? -- demonstrated in quick succession investors' hair-trigger nervousness about the market break that everyone seems to expect, and their extraordinary willingness to jump back in with both feet at every buying opportunity that their collective jitters create.</p>

        <p>One brutal October morning on Wall Street -- why does that phrase seem so familiar? -- demonstrated in quick succession investors' hair-trigger nervousness about the market break that everyone seems to expect, and their extraordinary willingness to jump back in with both feet at every buying opportunity that their collective jitters create.</p>
        <p>Rattled by a series of gloomy earnings warnings from technology companies and evidence that energy supplies are growing even tighter, the market dived so fast at the opening Thursday morning that people started thinking crash -- the Dow industrials lost 435 points, or 4.3 percent, in the first 19 minutes, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite was off 5.8 percent. But the bull-market reflex that turns horror at falling prices into hunger for bargains kicked in almost as fast, and by lunchtime almost all the losses were erased.</p>
        <p>Despite the volatility and the nervous mood, the Dow finished the week with a small gain, and the Nasdaq composite actually posted a strong 5 percent advance for the week. The dollar continued to gain strength against the euro and the Japanese yen, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond drifted down to 5.727 percent.</p>
