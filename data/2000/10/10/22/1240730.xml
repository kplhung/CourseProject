        <p>THOMAS EDWALD ALDON cuts an unusual figure in this town of conservative, fashionably dressed residents.</p>
        <p>Wearing a red down vest on all but the warmest of days, gray khaki pants and running shoes, Mr. Aldon pushes a shopping cart filled with his belongings along the Boston Post Road.</p>
        <p>His grayish-yellow hair spills out from under a black baseball cap. A long, straggly beard falls halfway down his chest. He says he's 57, but looks much older.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aldon, known to most people as Pete, is homeless and has been living here for about two years, Police Commissioner Joseph A. Zerille said.</p>
        <p>''He's part of the community,'' said Dan Love, the associate pastor at the Rye Presbyterian Church. ''People know him. Some take care of him. The high school kids all say hello to him. But he doesn't ask for help, and he goes around quietly without fanfare.''</p>
        <p>The Post Road has long been traveled by wanderers making their way up and down the East Coast. But none have adopted Rye the way Mr. Aldon has. At first, he camped on the grounds of the Marshlands Nature Center, said the Rev. Dr. Richard E. Murdoch, senior pastor of the Rye Presbyterian Church. But he was evicted.</p>
        <p>''That's when he began his trek,'' said Dr. Murdoch.</p>
        <p>He often perches at the exit of the Cross Westchester Expressway and looks out longingly at the cars streaming by.</p>
        <p>He rarely says more than a ''God bless you'' to anyone who walks by him. Mr. Aldon avoids Purchase Street altogether, Rye's tony, main street.</p>
        <p>''I've seen him as far down as the Sheldrake Creek Bridge in Mamaroneck,'' Dr. Murdoch said. ''But now he has a little place -- kind of a shelf -- up above the concrete abutment under the I-95 overpass. Nobody bothers him. I don't think the police do. I've heard on cold days, they're very considerate and don't expect him to vacate his spot underneath the bridge.</p>
        <p>''I've told him we house homeless men every fourth Saturday night at the church, but he never shows up. I think everyone in town slips him a few dollars every once in awhile. He's very proud. He doesn't accept things that easily. But, occasionally, he'll take something from me.''</p>
        <p>Another Rye resident who said she helps him out said, ''Pete's a reminder of the real world.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone helps Mr. Aldon out or likes his presence here.</p>
        <p>''Certain people don't want him around,'' said Commissioner Zerille, a 23-year veteran in the police department. ''They don't want to have to look at him. I say to them: 'Yes, you don't like him. Maybe your kids are afraid of him. But you can't pick your neighbors, and it's a free country.'</p>
        <p>''I can't say to him, 'Hey, we've got to get you out of town because you don't fit.' He's never threatened anyone. He hasn't posed any safety problems. We've never even had a complaint that he's panhandled. Nothing he's doing has violated the code of law.''</p>
        <p>The nearest shelter is at the County Airport in Harrison. The homeless shelter is operated by the Volunteers of America, the nation's largest, private provider of services to the homeless. Its vans pick up the homeless every night at spots in White Plains, Mount Vernon and Yonkers, but its director, Linda McNeil, said that a van could be sent to Rye if the police called.</p>
        <p>''In frigid weather,'' Commissioner Zerille said, ''I've directed Pete to the shelter. But I don't know if he gets in the van. I don't follow him around every day, and there are a lot of wooded areas in Rye, so we can't always find him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aldon speaks in a voice resembling Popeye the Sailor Man, but it is even more  gnarled and indecipherable. Words, at times, charge out of his mouth, but they rarely appear true.</p>
        <p>''I go to the shelter every night,'' he said, but then he is seen sleeping underneath the bridge.</p>
        <p>He said he is from Syracuse and has lived in New York State his entire life. But he seems to have fought in the Vietnam War because, one day, out of the blue, he said, ''They're covering up troop movement in Cambodia,'' and then he asked, ''You ever been to South Vietnam?''</p>
        <p>Another day, while waiting near the highway at dusk, he said, ''I'm waiting for someone who's going to pick me up and drive me down to Delaware.'' But, a few minutes later, he was pushing his cart back down the Post Road.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aldon seems capable of taking care of himself on the streets. His cart is filled with a green tarp, insulation padding and pillows. He shops for himself, buying goods like canned soup and canned vegetables, bread and sliced turkey at the A.&amp;P. A teapot is strapped to the side of his cart as are his  groceries and garbage. The cart must weigh more than 100 pounds, but Mr. Aldon pushes it for miles almost every day.</p>
        <p>Dr. Murdoch said Mr. Aldon reminds him of the hermits who used to live in caves in Greece and Turkey in the first and second centuries. ''It's an old, old tradition in the Christian Church,'' Dr. Murdoch said. ''It was the first monastic order. They'd spend their lives in solitary existence.</p>
        <p>''Pete's basically an antisocial person. Homeless shelters are terribly threatening and scary for someone with no social skills like Pete. If he didn't live on the streets, what would be his option? He'd be institutionalized. I don't think he could survive it. He wouldn't be free to come and go. He'd have to abide by the rules.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McNeil said it is not easy to get people to change the way they live.</p>
        <p>''The public does not recognize the severe disability the homeless often have,'' Ms. McNeil said. ''They're not homeless because they lost their job or have nowhere to live. Westchester County is excellent in providing assisted living and transitional housing.</p>
        <p>''What most people don't realize is that homeless people have a life, and they like their life. If you say to a homeless person, 'You don't have a home.' They'll say: 'I have a home. It's right here under the bridge.' ''</p>
        <p>When asked how long he had been homeless, Mr. Aldon said, ''I've never been homeless.''</p>
