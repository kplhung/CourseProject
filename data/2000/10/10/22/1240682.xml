        <p>LAURENCE FISHBURNE had come to know well the universe depicted in his new movie ''Once in the Life,'' an urban landscape where the streets are bleak and menacing, where the habitats are drug lords' garish lairs and junkies' decrepit shooting galleries. But it was professional rather than personal experience that had given him the education. Growing up in the acting business, Mr. Fishburne, who is 39, played a passel of standard-issue street types, the thugs and hustlers who often reside at the shabby edges of movies, television shows and plays about crime and depravity in the city.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Fishburne, raised in a middle-class Brooklyn family and trained at the High School for the Performing Arts, took from those early acting jobs was the idealistic idea that the lives of these marginal figures were considerably more vibrant and complex than the plays or movies in which they were used as reality-centering props.</p>
        <p>''I had to make a living playing pimps and pushers and dope fiends,'' Mr. Fishburne recalled. ''They were relegated to the outside of story lines, and they were delivered as fairly stereotypical creatures. I guess I always had a desire to create a piece where these people were the focus. My job here was to make them interesting, real, breathing, living people.''</p>
        <p>In ''Once in the Life,'' with which Mr. Fishburne makes his debut as a screenwriter and director, he takes that actory conceit and sees to it that life's losers get their say. The movie, which opens on Friday, features Mr. Fishburne, Titus Welliver and Eamonn Walker as a trio of small-time crooks and addicts who struggle as much over questions of loyalty and their emotional ties to one another as they do over the fortune in heroin that two of them have stolen, not knowing it belongs to the third. Gregory Hines, Annabella Sciorra and Paul Calderon play the assorted hitmen, lovers and drug barons who populate their world.</p>
        <p>How personal a venture this was for Mr. Fishburne is reflected in the work's pedigree. Not only did he serve as one of its three producers -- another, Helen Sugland, is his manager -- but the source material for ''Once in the Life'' was also a stage play by a fledgling playwright by the name of Laurence Fishburne. ''Riff Raff'' was its title during a critically well-received Off Broadway run in 1995, in which Mr. Fishburne appeared with Mr. Welliver and the rapper Heavy D.</p>
        <p>The success of the three-character play, which was set entirely in the tenement in which Mr. Fishburne's and Mr. Welliver's characters hide out, emboldened Mr. Fishburne to turn it into an independent film. It was shot in New York City for the rather minimal sum of $2.8 million.</p>
        <p>''I remember saying to him when I read the play the very first time that it would make a great movie,'' said Mr. Welliver, who has portrayed the heroin-addicted Torch in each incarnation since the play's very first production in Los Angeles in 1994. ''The conversation became how to open it up, for him to open it up, but not to open it so much that it became 'Apocalypse Now.' ''</p>
        <p>Like its theatrical antecedent, ''Once in the Life'' is a small, intense piece that has a kinship with gritty slice-of-life dramas of the 60's and 70's. Torch and Mr. Fishburne's 20/20 Mike botch the theft of the heroin and kill a relative of the local drug kingin Manny Rivera (Mr. Calderon), who sends Mr. Walker's Tony the Tiger to find and kill the thieves. As insurance, Manny takes hostage Tony's wife, Maxine (Ms. Sciorra), and their toddler. (Mr. Hines, the actor and tap dancer, plays a small-time hood who has, in something of an inside joke, a limp.)</p>
        <p>The violence is all off screen, and the characters could have come from a Mamet play were it not for the lyrical language; in fact, the dramatic centerpiece of ''Riff Raff'' was a long, hypnotic poem that was recited by Heavy D. In the movie, Mr. Walker, a British actor best known here as the charismatic Muslim inmate Said in the HBO series ''Oz,'' now tackles the poem, but it is interspersed throughout the movie, in flashback scenes with Mr. Fishburne and in a climactic confrontation in the tenement that ends violently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fishburne wrote the play in a week while on a movie set, and he worked on the storyboards for ''Once in the Life'' while he was in Australia shooting ''The Matrix'' (1999) with Keanu Reeves. ''The storyboard artist had never seen any of the places in my movie,'' the actor recalled, ''so I was running around getting maps and pictures of New York.''</p>
        <p>Figuring out ''how you have a seven-minute poem in your movie'' was one of Mr. Fishburne's more daunting challenges. Another was creating visual embroidery for a stage work that drew its power from the emotional fireworks set off in that dreary drug chamber. The first 20 minutes of ''Once in the Life'' takes the audience to various other times and places, most significantly back to the childhoods of Torch and 20/20, to explain the roots of their intense but troubled bond.</p>
        <p>''I had to get out of the room at some point,'' Mr. Fishburne said of the narrative's elaboration. ''I couldn't stay in the room for the whole movie and I couldn't give up the room, either. I want people to be claustrophobic. I want people to feel, 'I want to get out of the room, but I can't.' ''</p>
        <p>It's doubtful the movie's advertising team would plaster ''Claustrophobic!'' across the billboards. The actors seem to understand that. ''It's a very difficult movie to market because you can't put it out there and say, 'It's a gangster film,' '' said Mr. Welliver, who had a major role in the television series ''Brooklyn South.'' ''It's a throwback to the films of the late 60's: 'Mean Streets,'  'Midnight Cowboy,'  'Blue Collar.' The characters, they're car wrecks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Welliver and Mr. Walker both say that Mr. Fishburne presides over a pretty loose set. ''Laurence has this great word he uses,'' Mr. Welliver said. ''He just says, 'I came here to swing.' He meant that he had come to do his best and expected you to do the same. He had so much to do himself that a lot of his direction was very minimal. He would just kind of say, 'We've got that one, here's a free one. Do something, whatever you want to do.' ''</p>
        <p>This kind of freedom wins friends and influences people. ''That is,'' Mr. Welliver said ''truly an anomaly in this business.''</p>
