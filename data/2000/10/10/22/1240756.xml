        <p>Newsday has ended its weekly Executive Edition and shifted editorial coverage to a new Web site and an enlarged Business &amp; Technology section. The online coverage, at newsday.com/ebiz, will provide frequent updates on local and national business news and emphasize technology, real estate and health care, said Raymond A.

        <p>Newsday Ends One Edition And Begins New Web Site</p>
        <p>Newsday has ended its weekly Executive Edition and shifted editorial coverage to a new Web site and an enlarged Business &amp; Technology section. The online coverage, at newsday.com/ebiz, will provide frequent updates on local and national business news and emphasize technology, real estate and health care, said Raymond A. Jansen, Newsday's publisher.</p>
        <p>The expanded Business &amp; Technology section on Mondays will include a column on innovation, industry leaders, a technology-oriented column on workplace issues, and additional Manhattan high-tech news.</p>
        <p>Newsday sent the Executive Edition to 10,000 ''business and opinion leaders,'' said Howard Schneider, a managing editor. Its last regular edition appeared on Monday. Newsday will continue to publish quarterly economic reports under the Executive Edition name for the same readership, Mr. Schneider said.</p>
        <p>''It didn't make sense to continue publishing a weekly in print when we could publish a minute-by-minute account on the Web,'' Mr. Schneider said. ''By shifting content from the Executive Edition to the Web site, we expand our ability to deliver news in a much more timely way.''</p>
        <p>Morton's Restaurants Post a Record Quarter</p>
        <p>Morton's Restaurant Group (NYSE: MRG) of New Hyde Park reported a record third quarter net income of 20 cents a share on third quarter revenues of $56.3 million, a 23 percent increase over the prior year's third-quarter revenues.</p>
        <p>By the end of the year, the company will have 57 Morton's of Chicago steakhouses, most of them in the United States. Its first restaurant on Long Island is scheduled to open in Great Neck on Oct. 30.</p>
        <p>Around the Island</p>
        <p>Reckson Associates of Melville adopted a ''poison pill'' shareholder-rights plan last week but denied it was in response to a specific takeover attempt. . . . Avis Group Holdings Inc. of Garden City surpassed analysts' expectations by reporting a strong third quarter. Earnings were up 24 percent. . . . Aeroflex Inc. (Nasdaq: ARXX) of Plainview has acquired the Altair Aerospace Corporation,  a software developer in Bowie, Md.</p>
