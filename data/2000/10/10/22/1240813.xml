        <p>WITH baseball, football, hockey and preseason basketball all clamoring for attention at the moment, the notion that five men might spend two hours in a room together and not talk about sports seems beyond improbable. Yet that is just what happens in ''Elephant Sighs,'' the flawed but likable comedy now having its East Coast premiere at the Forum Theater in Metuchen.</p>
        <p>The Mets, Patrick Ewing and Vinny Testaverde go completely unmentioned as Joel (Michael Mahoney), a newcomer to an unnamed small town, attends his first meeting of a local men's group. He arrives not knowing quite what to expect -- although he has been told of the meeting, he has not been let in on what the group actually does. Is it a card-playing club? A hobbyists' association? Something illegal? He spends the play trying to figure it out, and the four oddballs already in the group don't help him much.</p>

        <p>WITH baseball, football, hockey and preseason basketball all clamoring for attention at the moment, the notion that five men might spend two hours in a room together and not talk about sports seems beyond improbable. Yet that is just what happens in ''Elephant Sighs,'' the flawed but likable comedy now having its East Coast premiere at the Forum Theater in Metuchen.</p>
        <p>The Mets, Patrick Ewing and Vinny Testaverde go completely unmentioned as Joel (Michael Mahoney), a newcomer to an unnamed small town, attends his first meeting of a local men's group. He arrives not knowing quite what to expect -- although he has been told of the meeting, he has not been let in on what the group actually does. Is it a card-playing club? A hobbyists' association? Something illegal? He spends the play trying to figure it out, and the four oddballs already in the group don't help him much.</p>
        <p>The author, Ed Simpson, seems to have consciously set out to write a ''guy play,'' a counter to all those ''chick'' plays and movies in which women share deep thoughts and witty remarks. So it's apparent early on that before the bizarre meeting is over, each of the five characters will have had his revelatory moment.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, Mr. Simpson doesn't have much to offer in this regard. The revelations end up being fairly obligatory -- one man has marital trouble, another a sick spouse, a third a career crisis. But Mr. Simpson, an associate professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, turns these familiar themes in unexpected, often hilarious ways.</p>
        <p>Nick (Brian Thomas Fitzpatrick) hasn't merely lost his wife; she is having him digitally removed from all the family photographs. Perry (David Wells) isn't just having a garden-variety career problem; he is a former minister whose congregation voted him out of office because his mind kept wandering during prayers. In fact, it's wandering still; seldom has an actor gotten more comedic mileage out of a vacant look than Mr. Wells does here.</p>
        <p>In any case, the fact that the playwright doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know about men and the emotions they bottle up is almost beside the point. As the director, Peter J. Loewy, seems to know, the fun here is in the journey that gets us to the revelations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahoney puts just the right amount of deadpan cluelessness into the Joel character, and his well-grounded portrayal serves as an anchor for the play, letting the other four actors get wacky when necessary. There are dead spots, but when the play's comedy works, it works very well. A scene in which the somewhat psychotic Nick turns Joel's ''overdeveloped flinch reflex'' into a weapon is a pratfall-filled gem, so much so that the audience is left wondering whether Mr. Mahoney will make it through the run of the play without breaking a limb or two. The same concern may occur during another hysterical scene between the two characters in which Joel finds himself stranded on a rather tall ladder, at Nick's wild-eyed mercy. It's not out of the question that some of the looks of terror that cross Mr. Mahoney's face during these high-altitude moments are genuine.</p>
        <p>In an early performance, the two older actors in the cast, Patrick Tull as Dink and Richard Herd as the group's father figure, Leo, seemed not quite up to the fast-paced lunacy at times. Conversely, there were times when the script seemed not up to the skills of the veteran cast. Leo, for instance, is required to emit belches and other juvenile noises, an uncomfortable and unnecessary distraction. Perry and Nick engage in bursts of mutual animosity that seem to come from nowhere.</p>
        <p>On the whole, the bright spots in the play cover the weaknesses in the acting and vice-versa, and things should only get better as the ensemble gels. Frank Knox's utilitarian set helps the play along without being intrusive. The result is a diverting evening, and -- perhaps best of all -- one that knows when to stop.</p>
        <p>''Take it easy, kid; everything will become clear,'' Leo tells Joel at about the 50-minute mark of the play, just when the audience is beginning to wonder how much longer the what-is-this-meeting-for gimmick can be stretched. And sure enough, shortly thereafter the play's cryptic title is explained, and everything does become clear. Or as clear as things can be in a make-believe world where men actually talk to one another.</p>
