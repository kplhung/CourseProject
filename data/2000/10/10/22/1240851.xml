        <p>The state's unemployment rate dropped to 3.8 percent last month, down from 4.0 percent in August, the state Labor Department reported last week. The September unemployment rate marks the seventh consecutive month that New Jersey has held unemployment at or below 4 percent. The jobless rate has also been at or below the national rate since the beginning of the year and is 0.8 percentage points below  a year ago. The state added 14,600 jobs in September. Of the new jobs, the Labor Department reported that 6,0000 were in the public sector and 8,000 were in the private sector. Local government also gained 8,100 jobs, offsetting a decrease in the number of people employed at the state and federal level.</p>
