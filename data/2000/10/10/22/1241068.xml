        <p>With the Islanders playing only four games in the first 13 days of the regular season, right wing Brad Isbister said that a better indication of the team's ability would come when the games began to occur more frequently, such as this weekend's consecutive encounters with Atlanta and Washington.</p>
        <p>''When things aren't going so well, you have too much time to dwell on them -- and it's harder to get any kind of momentum going,'' Isbister said tonight after the Islanders tied the Washington Capitals in overtime, 4-4, at the MCI Center.</p>

        <p>With the Islanders playing only four games in the first 13 days of the regular season, right wing Brad Isbister said that a better indication of the team's ability would come when the games began to occur more frequently, such as this weekend's consecutive encounters with Atlanta and Washington.</p>
        <p>''When things aren't going so well, you have too much time to dwell on them -- and it's harder to get any kind of momentum going,'' Isbister said tonight after the Islanders tied the Washington Capitals in overtime, 4-4, at the MCI Center.</p>
        <p>Coupled with their 5-3 victory on Friday over Atlanta, the Islanders, now 1-3-2, have had their most productive spurt of the young season.</p>
        <p>Isbister provided some offensive spark tonight. He scored two goals and fed right wing Mariusz Czerkawski for what appeared to be the winning goal 7 minutes 25 seconds from the end of regulation. Still, Isbister's boarding violation soon after set up the Capitals for center Andrei Nikolishin's tying goal.</p>
        <p>The Capitals' unbeaten streak against the Islanders is now at 16 games. The Capitals have not lost to the Islanders since March 2, 1997.</p>
        <p>Washington kept the pressure on through much of the first period, outshooting the Islanders by 17-4. Goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, who had 38 saves in the game, was under siege almost from the start. Twice in a 15-second span midway through the period, the Capitals stole the puck from his teammates, only to have Vanbiesbrouck come up with a save. But Washington finally broke through at 13:12.</p>
        <p>Capitals right wing Joe Murphy slammed Islanders' defenseman Kevin Haller against the boards, knocking him down. Murphy seized the puck and shuffled it to Ulf Dahlen in the corner. Dahlen then flicked a crossing pass to the closing Nikolishin, who scored just before Haller arrived back at his position.</p>
        <p>After a holding violation by the rookie left wing Jeff Toms at 14:51, the Islanders were one second from killing the penalty when Dahlen followed his own shot to give the Capitals a two-goal lead.</p>
        <p>Indicative of how inoffensive the Islanders were in the period, center Dave Scatchard once had a step on the nearest Washington player when the puck bounded up the ice, but he veered off when he saw three defenders swarming after him. Scatchard turned, looking for an ally, any ally. There was none within 30 feet, so he had to give up the puck.</p>
        <p>With less than a minute in the period, center Claude Lapointe found himself with a breakaway. But he shot in full stride from 25 feet, and Washington's goalie, Olaf Kolzig, smothered the shot.</p>
        <p>As hapless as the Islanders were in the first period, they played with intensity in the second.</p>
        <p>Isbister scored two power-play goals in a 2:22 stretch to tie the game at the period's 8:45 mark. Defenseman Garry Galley fed Isbister, who ripped the puck past Kolzig in the net's left corner to get the Islanders started at 6:33. Defenseman Kenny Jonsson's shot from the left point rattled around inside and popped to Isbister, who drove it home.</p>
        <p>That sent a chill through the crowd of 13,502, accustomed to the Capitals' dominance in this series.</p>
        <p>The Islanders weren't through. Scatchard won a face-off four minutes later, and the puck bounded to defenseman Roman Hamrlik. Once he gained control, Hamrlik turned and shot from 30 feet. Somehow, considering the maze of bodies in front of the net, the puck reached the net.</p>
        <p>It was Hamrlik's third goal in two nights. The Islanders nursed their 3-2 lead until penalties hurt them. A slashing call against Galley 1:44 into the third period and an unusual delay-of-game infraction at 2:36 on Hamrlik, for holding the puck with his hand, gave Washington a five-on-three situation.</p>
        <p>The Islanders tried to defend with defenseman Zdeno Chara, center Mike Stapleton and Jonsson, and Vanbiesbrouck stopped the first two shots aimed at him. But the Capitals worked the puck inside to Dahlen, who slipped it into the net's left corner.</p>
        <p>The score came at 3:40, just four seconds before Galley would have returned to the ice.</p>
