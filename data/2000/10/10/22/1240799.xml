        <p>OLD-TIMERS say there's mojo in these walls,'' said Maureen Myers, rocking slowly in her chair and smiling at the shrine that surrounds her -- walls painstakingly covered with autographed photos of blues legends. ''They feel the spirits here are very friendly, similar to when they started out in Chicago.''</p>
        <p>As the proprietor of the Stanhope House, she uses the term spirits, literally. ''This house is over 200 years old -- a lot of people have died here. Previous owners have died here. And Thelma died in the back room,'' Ms. Myers says, pointing to what is now a billiards room. ''We've got two ghosts here now. I've seen a male ghost here in the entryway, and we've got a female ghost by the console.''</p>
        <p>Dating from 1790 (and four decades before that, if you ask Ms. Myers, who believes that the original deed was issued by the King of England in 1752), the building has sheltered and entertained many souls. It began as a private residence for Lord Stanhope. Over the years it evolved from a stage coach stop to a post office, and some even say a brothel. Babe Ruth gambled here during Prohibition, and Daniel Webster gave a speech from the front porch, says Ms. Myers.</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's, it has been a music club, offering its small stage to such blues greats as Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Koko Taylor, Buddy Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughn. These days, prominent national acts share the stage with local talent.</p>
        <p>''This place has a great sense of history. It's amazing to stand on a stage where Muddy Waters played,'' said Andy Bernstein, leader singer of the New Brunswick-based VooDudes, a patron since the 70's, and a performer here for the past 10 years. ''Over the years there've been different layouts, but it's always been a comfortable place. It's an adventure. For five bucks you don't know what you're going to get.''</p>
        <p>Red Christmas lights punctuate the darkness where Eva Marie Pucillo swayed to the upbeat, washboard-backed Creole rhythm of the VooDudes on a recent Friday night. ''I live right down the street and I've been coming here for 20 years,'' she said. ''There have been so many times when I've had the opportunity to move and I didn't because of this place. I can have two beers and listen to music and ride my bicycle home and feel safe.''</p>
        <p>One of only two bars in town, the Stanhope House does not serve food, and draws a late crowd. ''This is Mayberry,'' said Ms. Myers. ''There's nothing else open in this town.'' Before 10 p.m., the large, old house with the columned porch on Main Street is as dormant as the rest of the sleepy town. But, in the middle of the night, the old roadhouse erupts with music that shakes the dusty wood floor and ricochets off the pressed tin ceiling.</p>
        <p>From Thursday through Sunday, the Stanhope House delivers blues, rock, bluegrass, zydeco, funk and folk music for a cover charge, usually under $10. And the club offers a three-song satisfaction guarantee. Anyone who leaves before hearing a third song can get a refund.</p>
        <p>''This is an old roadhouse,'' said Ms. Myers. ''You're supposed to party and have a good time. If you spill your beer on the floor we're not going to run over and clean it up.'' The mood of the jumping club matches that of the dress code: comfortable and relaxed, but not rowdy.</p>
        <p>Beneath the hand-hewn beams of the low ceiling, Mary Myers pulls cold draughts and mixes drinks. ''I remember when my parents bought this place seven years ago,'' she said. ''I loved it the moment I saw it. We've made some changes, but not many. You don't want to change a place like the Stanhope House.''</p>
        <p>Joyce Bickham, a 10-year patron, said: ''This place is not pretentious. A lot of people put antiques on the walls, but this place is antique. We like Cajun music, and there are not too many places around here that offer it. And it's a great mix of people. On the dance floor you'll see someone in their 20's jumping around crazily and next to them there'll be an older guy doing a beautiful two-step with his lady friend.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bickham's husband, Brett, added: ''This is not a townie bar. There's a real eclectic mix of people, from age to socio-economics. You'll see a pickup truck and a Mercedes parked side-by-side. The music quality is always consistently good -- this is the Carnegie Hall for blues and zydeco fans.''</p>
        <p>Jim Beckerman, keyboard player and co-founder of the VooDudes, appreciates his gigs at this old roadhouse. ''It's not corporate -- it's a real juke joint,'' he said. ''There are lots of corporate, fake juke joints that try to look like this. The Stanhope House is the real thing.''</p>
        <p>AN EVENING IN STANHOPE  Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about the Stanhope House music club in Stanhope misspelled the surname of a blues musician who has played there. He was Stevie Ray Vaughan, not Vaughn.</p>
