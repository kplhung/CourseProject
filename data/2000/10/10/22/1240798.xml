        <p>Nassau County's budget woes have prompted an early retirement exodus by county employees [''Nassau May Be Losing Best to Employee Retirement Offer,'' Oct. 15]. Among the 566 employees who are opting for early retirement or severance packages are experienced workers of all levels up to and including commissioners.</p>
        <p>But this does not have to be the end of their careers in public service on Long Island.</p>
        <p>YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities, and other long Island not-for-profit and community-based organizations have plenty of opportunities for qualified, hard-working employees to work in group homes, employment training and other programs throughout Long Island.</p>
        <p>Former county employees' transition to the field of human services would be truly an extension of their careers. What could be more fulfilling than being entrusted with the well-being of an individual with a disability, who relies on you to help them realize their potential, achieve goals and lead productive lives in the community?</p>
        <p>Thanks to New York State's five-year commitment to expand group homes and other services for people with mental retardation and developmental disabilities, career opportunities are growing. And the background, sensitivity, experience and years of dedicated service of former Nassau County employees are assets that make them well qualified for our field.</p>
