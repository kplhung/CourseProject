        <p>JEREMY IRONS took in the scene, the celebrity-clotted party for the opening of the Giorgio Armani retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum on Wednesday, and leaned against a parapet, cowering a bit in the crush. Summoning his fortitude, Mr. Irons, clad in black-on-black Armani and looking like a reedy impersonation of himself, said, ''Armani is always understated.'' Mr. Irons has worn the designer's clothes on and off for more than 20 years, and he added with a grin, ''He knows how to make me look less stuffy than I normally do.''</p>
        <p>The homage stemmed partly from friendship -- just moments before, Mr. Irons had greeted the silver-haired, 66-year-old designer with a bearhug -- and partly from a purely theatrical instinct. ''Yes, I'm giving a performance -- this space is certainly cut out for that,'' Mr. Irons conceded, with an upward glance at the museum's famously serpentine ramp, which Robert Wilson, who designed the installation, had shrouded in muslin. But Mr. Irons would have performed even without the imposing platform. ''As an actor, one tends to come in at the level that's required,'' he said.</p>

        <p>JEREMY IRONS took in the scene, the celebrity-clotted party for the opening of the Giorgio Armani retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum on Wednesday, and leaned against a parapet, cowering a bit in the crush. Summoning his fortitude, Mr. Irons, clad in black-on-black Armani and looking like a reedy impersonation of himself, said, ''Armani is always understated.'' Mr. Irons has worn the designer's clothes on and off for more than 20 years, and he added with a grin, ''He knows how to make me look less stuffy than I normally do.''</p>
        <p>The homage stemmed partly from friendship -- just moments before, Mr. Irons had greeted the silver-haired, 66-year-old designer with a bearhug -- and partly from a purely theatrical instinct. ''Yes, I'm giving a performance -- this space is certainly cut out for that,'' Mr. Irons conceded, with an upward glance at the museum's famously serpentine ramp, which Robert Wilson, who designed the installation, had shrouded in muslin. But Mr. Irons would have performed even without the imposing platform. ''As an actor, one tends to come in at the level that's required,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What was required on Wednesday night was nothing more or less than ''to wear Mr. Armani's clothes and make the designer happy,'' Mr. Irons added. He was one of hundreds of guests, a surprising number of them Hollywood gentry, who came prepared to do just that -- to be ''on'' for their style guru.</p>
        <p>Fashion journalists, who were among the first to mythologize Mr. Armani, were also the first to weary of his look, with its characteristically murky palette and built-in slouch. But celebrities, some of whom have worn the designer's studiously low-key suits and discreetly sparkling evening dresses for decades, remain his fervid acolytes. With a reverence Hollywood used to hold in less style-obsessed times for Lee Strasberg or maybe the guru Muktananda, the stars filed toward the designer like pilgrims to a shrine -- Richard Gere, Billy Crystal, Michelle Pfeiffer, Lauren Bacall, Cuba Gooding Jr., Glenn Close. Many seemed to be there to make good on a debt they felt was owed to a man who had, through the language of clothes, transformed them from insecure ingenues to worldly sophisticates.</p>
        <p>''He's been dressing me for 20 years,'' Ms. Pfeiffer said. ''I feel I can always rely on him -- it's a huge relief.''</p>
        <p>Pat Riley, the head coach of the Miami Heat, who derives at least some of his iconic status from his Armani suits, said his presence was something of a payback. ''I should be in San Antonio,'' he said, where his team was to play the next evening. ''But I'm here to honor Mr. Armani.''</p>
        <p>Dylan McDermott, wearing a black Armani jacket, shirt and trousers, said: ''He's been really kind to me. He dressed me when things weren't so great.'' He's still dressing him now that he's a hit in the television series ''The Practice.''</p>
        <p>The famous sipped, strolled and stared at the exhibition of suits, coats, trousers and dresses that seemed to float in midair, as if George or Marion Kirby, Topper's ghostly friends, might at any time inhabit them. Many claimed enduring friendships and close collaborations with the designer. And while it is true that Mr. Armani and his publicists have cultivated the allegiance of these stars over the years -- wardrobing them, flying them to Milan runway shows or exotic destinations where the designer has vacation houses, treating them, in short, like royalty -- the assiduous courtship does not in itself explain the designer's formidable drawing power.</p>
        <p>The designer's magnetism can be partly ascribed to his somewhat mysterious, Svengali-like persona: he is a man of few words, perhaps because he speaks so little English. He cultivates a priestly mien. Ascetically turned out in a black dinner jacket -- not Armani, it turned out, but Yohji Yamamoto -- with white shirt and solid black tie, he turned even swanning starlets into fans. ''I love his eyes,'' gushed Thora Birch, who played Kevin Spacey's surly daughter in ''American Beauty.'' Ms. Birch, who looked worldly beyond her 18 years in a satin Armani evening coat and trousers, said she found the designer sexy, though the two had never spoken.</p>
        <p>''He's the best architect of clothing that I know,'' Richard Meier, the architect, said. Others pointed out that, unlike most of his contemporaries, Mr. Armani has never strained to be hip, and so has staying power. ''Leontyne Price once said to me, 'I always sing on my reserve, never my capital,' '' recalled Stan Herman, the president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. ''Armani is like that.''</p>
        <p>For the screen personalities he has garbed, Mr. Armani is a magician who confers on them an air of respectability, with a subtly risque edge. ''Whatever he puts you in, you feel modern, but not trendy,'' Ms. Pfeiffer said. ''You know that he'll never embarrass you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gooding likewise credited the designer with helping him construct a public persona. ''When you know you want to go out and look classy, you wear Armani,'' he said. Preening in a slender, calf-length Armani coat, he added, ''Wear clothes likes this, and you know you'll be taken seriously.''</p>
        <p>Early in his career, Mr. Armani applied himself with a Jesuit's intensity to the study of actors and films. In consequence, he understands, better than most of his peers, how to iron out an actor's kinks through clothing, without erasing the quirks that make him compelling. Ms. Close recalled feeling sartorially at sixes and sevens before buying her first Armani, a mottled, slate-colored jacket, in 1983. These days, Armani is a second skin. ''I can put on one beautiful dress of his and feel that I am more myself,'' she said. For many, an Armani dress or suit is both a security blanket and a subversive badge, apparel that endows women with a masculine, Garboesque swagger, and men with an androgynous sensuality.</p>
        <p>After the opening -- the exhibition closes on Jan. 17 -- guests obediently trekked down Fifth Avenue to a dinner at 9 West 57th Street. Never mind that Mr. Armani himself was conspicuously absent. They milled on the 38th floor of the building, in a space decorated for the occasion to resemble a minimalist inferno: red carpeting and plexiglass tables were lighted from within. Even the red-on-black exit signs contributed to the Dante-esque atmosphere.</p>
        <p>As did the lighting, so dim at times that the risotto, prepared by the restaurant Daniel and served cafeteria-style to the masses, took on the appearance of nursery gruel. No matter. The stars ate greedily, content to brood in the somber light and to let themselves be upstaged by the spectacle of Manhattan, visible in every direction through picture windows wrapping all the way around the open floor.</p>
        <p>Seated with his back to the view, smoking a cigar and trading banter with Liam Neeson and Mr. Gere, Robert De Niro was as much a magnet to photographers and fans as Mr. Armani had been earlier. Legions of the star-struck approached his table, standing three deep for a better view. If he was aware of the attention, he didn't acknowledge it. At the crowd's periphery stood Donna Karan, stealing glances at the star but asking plaintively: ''Where's Giorgio? Has anyone seen Giorgio? I wanted so much to say hello.''</p>
        <p>At 11, Mr. De Niro shambled to the elevator, sighing heavily. Would he comment on the event? The actor clamped three fingers to his lips and shook his head, mumbling through his hand, ''I can't I can't.'' Whether he had found the party too moving for words, or simply too exhausting, was a mystery.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 12, 2000, Sunday  An article on Oct. 22 about the opening of a Giorgio Armani retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum referred incorrectly to a dinner party that was held afterward at 9 West 57th Street. Mr. Armani was not ''conspicuously absent''; he attended, but in the large and dark room, some guests were unaware of his presence.</p>
