        <p>I'D never before been to Jamaica, and didn't know quite what to expect. Before my husband, Stuart, and I left, my mother-in-law, an inveterate reader of travel magazines, had warned us that every criminal in the country was lying in wait for American tourists. But what we  found upon landing at Montego Bay and rounding the corner into customs, was a group of musicians, in native garb, greeting us with a hokey welcome song.</p>
        <p>At first, barely awake after our dawn departure from Louisiana, I thought I was experiencing some kind of traveler's hallucination. But no, the cheery welcome band was flesh-and-blood, and an hour or so later, as I plunged into the famously clear blue Caribbean Sea, it dawned on me that there are worse things than getting up early.</p>
        <p>It was late September, and we were staying at the Half Moon Golf, Tennis and Beach Club, just a few miles from Montego Bay. The huge resort sprawls out behind high stucco walls on 400 acres of coastline, looking north toward Cuba.</p>
        <p>Though Stuart and I don't play golf at all and not much tennis, we figured that we could, at the very least, loll around on a couple of chaises in the shade of a palm or a coconut tree on the beach, and indulge in some competitive novel reading. Aside from a rather languorous middle-aged couple, both blond and sporting tiny bikinis, lying face up in the full sun a few palm trees away, we practically had the entire broad white, picture-perfect beach to ourselves.</p>
        <p>But first things first. The swim in that impossibly blue salty sea -- in the warm gentle waters of a protected bay -- effectively cured most of our minor ills. And what the swim didn't take care of, the Bloody Marys at lunch, at the resort's Seagrape Terrace restaurant, did. As I took my first sip, and looked around at the gorgeous terrace with its classic mahogany furniture, with the glistening white sand of the beach and the sparkling water beyond, I began to think that even I might relax enough to stop worrying about our three kids at home.</p>
        <p>Our junior suite was so beautiful that a part of me wanted to memorize its every detail, perhaps to emulate it at home. But I also wanted to get out and explore a bit. Perhaps I'd come across the likes of Queen Elizabeth or Eddie Murphy (both of whom have been guests). So off we set on a self-guided tour.</p>
        <p>There were flowers everywhere -- in vibrant island colors: pink, red, purple, white -- growing in beds along the meticulously maintained brick pathways and on overhanging vines, bursting out of pots. There were arches of flowers -- hibiscus, oleander, camellia and bougainvillea -- formed by trained vines. Also trees: lemon, almond, all-spice, coconut palms.</p>
        <p>We wandered down a covered, brick walkway past two-story stucco-faced beach-front blocks of guest rooms, sniffing the perfumed air, and thanking the Creator for having invented the 747.</p>
        <p>We walked past first one swimming pool (circular, with an island in the middle) then the next (Olympic-size), and then the next (smaller, half hidden), and then the next.  The resort has 53 swimming pools, some not much bigger than a big Jacuzzi, and many  tucked discreetly within the flanks of the guest cottages.</p>
        <p>Half Moon also has 13 tennis courts, a riding stable, an 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf course, and a total of 419 bedrooms in a variety of combinations -- from standard hotel rooms, to villas with as many as seven bedrooms and staffed by butler, maid and cook -- every last one of them decorated slightly differently.</p>
        <p>There are also several restaurants, snack bars and bars, a night club, a soccer field, a nature reserve, a shopping village, conference rooms, a putting green, a croquet lawn, nursery, children's playground, commissary, basketball and volleyball courts, and a fitness center, even a small hospital with a dialysis unit.</p>
        <p>Think of a somewhat sprawling college campus that happens to be in the tropics, decorated in high English colonial style with a twist of Mary Emmerling, staffed by an army of helpers, and filled with people majoring in tennis and golf, and you begin to get the idea. (The resort offers tennis lessons, and has a branch of the David Leadbetter Golf Academy.)</p>
        <p>Tuition? Not for the faint of pocketbook. Some offerings -- like playing tennis or working out in the spa's Nautilus room -- come at no extra cost, but many others are a la carte. There's snorkeling on a slightly off-shore reef, sailboats, wind-surfing, paddle-boats or bicycling around miles of bicycle and jogging paths. There are squash courts, a pavilion devoted to chess, fitness trainers and aquasizing (water exercise) classes.</p>
        <p>And then there are all those enticing spa offerings. A facial, with calming, healing aloe vera and lavender oil? Why not? It sounded good. Real good. I just didn't know where to start.</p>
        <p>''How about a nap?'' my husband said.</p>
        <p>We managed to navigate ourselves back to our room, in a white stucco cottage set back from the beach. It had a porch, with a table and chairs for dining and a chaise longue; inside was a sitting room with a television, a large bedroom with a king-size bed, and a big, tiled bathroom.</p>
        <p>There was also the requisite fully stocked minibar (was it self-indulgent to drink Champagne in the middle of the afternoon?) and an old-fashioned console-style radio. The floor, like those throughout the resort, was black and white tile, covered with Oriental area rugs. The white plaster ceiling arched above the bed like a tent, the walls were fancifully painted in a sponged pattern of swirling sky-blues, and the bed spread and curtains were of a bright floral pattern.</p>
        <p>It was, in short, the most fanciful hotel room I'd ever seen. Later, I learned that most of the handsome Queen Anne style mahogany furniture throughout the resort was made on the premises.</p>
        <p>By the next morning, we were sufficiently chilled out to start the day bright and early in the fitness center, where we'd signed on for a yoga class. At 8 a.m., the resort was in full swing, with men raking the beach and pulling seaweed from the sea floor to make bathing that much more delightful. Maids pushed cleaning carts and other employees carried room-service trays to and fro on bicycles.</p>
        <p>At the fitness center, our teacher was depressingly young and gorgeous, with the kind of body that you wouldn't think could occur via natural selection alone. She made us stretch our ankles and toes, our necks and shoulders, our inners and our outers, and when the class was over, asked if we were O.K. We were, but we were also, by then, very hungry. So we wandered back through the open-air reception area and settled down for breakfast at the central restaurant, the Seagrape Terrace.</p>
        <p>The food at Half Moon, particularly at the Seagrape, was a bit of a disappointment; the kitchen was somewhat uneven, the offerings a bit unimaginative. But breakfast was another story: fluffy scrambled eggs and omelets, stir-fried mixed green vegetables, muffins, French toast, dumplings, croissants, jellies, jams, fresh melon, fresh fruit salads, oatmeal, olives, yogurt.</p>
        <p>After breakfast, we settled in for a long morning of reading in the shade. By the time we'd emerged from our cottage in our bathing suits, the blond middle-aged couple were already out, soaking up the sun and drinking tall brightly colored drinks, and a waitress was taking drink orders. Just as I was beginning to doze off on my chaise, it was time for lunch again.</p>
        <p>Stuart wanted English fare, and so we hopped on a resort van for the Royal Stocks, a surprisingly authentic looking English pub in the resort's shopping village, but operated independently. The hamburgers (in the end, we decided against pub fare) were absolutely delicious.</p>
        <p>After lunch, we headed over to the luxurious spa, where each of us had signed on for a deep body massage. Situated in its own building, the spa is a warren of small and large rooms, all artfully decorated down to the attractive hand-cream containers and brass toilet-paper holders in the women's room, and the vase of flowers in the entry foyer. We were ushered into separate rooms and presently my masseuse knocked. After about 15 minutes of having my tensions beat out of me, I began to appreciate my physical being in a way I hadn't before.</p>
        <p>It's amazing how quickly time passes when you're basically doing nothing, because before we knew it, it was once again time to dine. Up the beach, a cocktail party  for the guests was in full swing under a dazzlingly starry sky. A steel band played ''Yellow Bird,'' and waiters circulated with hors d'oeuvres.</p>
        <p>I had a glass of Champagne, and then we caught a van to an off-campus restaurant, Belfield 1794. Out the gates and onto the main highway we went, and then up and down hills, around bends and through crowds, past shanties and half-completed government-subsidized housing, under villas built high up in the hills, skirting the flanks of mountains, through a valley and then up again into the hills on the other side of Montego Bay.</p>
        <p>It was worth the trip. The Belfield is an independently owned establishment on the resort's ''dine around'' plan, which allows you to charge meals at six restaurants to your resort bill. It is on the site of what had once been the sugar mill of the 3,000-acre Barnett estate, which dates from the days when the entire economy of the island was based on sugar cane, and Europeans were making money hand over fist from the labor of African slaves. Diners can visit the Great House, just steps from the restaurant, and get a glimpse of plantation life, but we skipped the history lesson in favor of immediate gratification.</p>
        <p>The restaurant -- an open-air round building under a thatched roof, situated above the dirt floor of the original mill -- is strikingly dramatic. As for the Jamaican cuisine: it was simple but delicious -- spicy, rich, tender and fresh. I had something called chicken stuff-stuff, which came with spicy yams and cassava, and Stuart had curried goat. Even the waiter was impressed by how well we'd cleaned our plates.</p>
        <p>Jamaica is a big island -- nearly the size of Connecticut -- and lushly beautiful: rolling green mountains, morning mists, turquoise sea, fantastic flowers. It wasn't until 1962 that Jamaica ended its colonial status under the British to become a self-governing member of the Commonwealth. Happily, we American tourists didn't have to convert our money (Jamaica is suffering terrible inflation, the Jamaican dollar losing value before your eyes), but instead could rely on our American dollars.</p>
        <p>Which we discovered the next day, when we took a 15-minute drive into Montego Bay, the island's second largest city. The streets were sultry, baking in the sun, and we seemed to attract the keen attention of just about every shopkeeper in town, all of whom seemed to be feeling the pinch of the off-season.</p>
        <p>On Gloucester Avenue -- known as the ''hip strip'' -- with its glitzy bars, hotels, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, and innumerable T-shirt and souvenir shops, I was approached by a half-dozen women who offered to braid my hair, Jamaican-style, for $30. But we were on a serious shopping expedition, having promised our children  something from the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>At last, gifts in hand (beads for our daughter, and noisemakers for our sons), we headed for lunch, at the poetically named Pork Pit. About as inelegant a setting as you can imagine, it had molded plastic orange tables and chairs, plastic cutlery and tissue-thin paper napkins. But oh, the food! We devoured our platters of jerk chicken, rice and beans, and roasted yams, accompanied by first-rate ginger beer.</p>
        <p>As we left, I was approached by yet another woman who offered to braid my hair. This time I said yes. I followed her down the road to her shop in the open-air crafts market, took a seat, and proceeded to undergo torture.</p>
        <p>Three women worked on me at once: I felt like I was getting scalped, and at one point started doing Lamaze breathing exercises. A half hour later, they were finished.</p>
        <p>''You look just like Bo Derek,'' they said. ''Beautiful.''</p>
        <p>And I did, except, of course, that I'm a half-foot shorter, 25 pounds heavier, 20 years older, and Jewish. My husband looked skeptical, too.</p>
        <p>Back at the Half Moon, the blond couple were still lying on the beach, only this time they'd both flipped over. People were sipping tall sweet rum-based drinks in brilliant shades, sailboats dotted the horizon, birds were singing in the trees, and the air smelled wonderful.</p>
        <p>But by the next afternoon, the Half Moon -- in all its extravagant and almost unworldly beauty, its rarefied luxury -- was a thousand miles behind us, and the sound of the Caribbean gently lapping against the beach had been replaced by the sound of traffic. The kids, however, loved their presents, and my $30 worth of beaded braids jangle when I walk.</p>
        <p>A resort, or an exclusive town?</p>
        <p>To visit Jamaica, Americans must have either a current passport or a certified birth certificate and some form of state-issued photo identification, like a driver's license. There is a departure tax of $26 a person.</p>
        <p>The Half Moon Golf, Tennis, and Beach Club, Half Moon Post Office, Rose Hall, Montego Bay, Jamaica, West Indies, is a few miles from Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay. Reservations and information: (800) 626-0592 or (876) 953-2615, fax (876) 953-2731; or go to www.halfmoon.com.jm.</p>
        <p>The resort offers a wide range of room types, meal plans and inclusive plans. For example, guests can choose to be on a breakfast plan, modified American plan, or full American plan. Likewise, there's a choice of a number of activity plans, like a Golf/Spa Plan, the Leadbetter Golf Plan (with lessons at the David Leadbetter Golf Academy), and a Spa Plan.</p>
        <p>Because my husband and I visited the resort during the off-season, breakfast was included with our room, a junior suite ($350 for both of us a night, for a total of $1,050 for three nights). But since we were not on any special plan, all our other meals, as well as spa treatments ($5 to $60), boat ($15 to $35 and hour) and bicycle ($10 to $15) rentals, exercise classes (about $25), and drinks at any of the resort's many bars or from our room's minibar were a la carte. Golf greens fees are $100.</p>
        <p>There is no extra charge for use of the resort's 53 pools, the Nautilus exercise room or gym, the 13 tennis courts, croquet lawn or the 18-hole putting course. The manager's punch party on Monday and Friday nights, and transportation around the resort -- as well as to the Belfield restaurant in Montego Bay -- were also included in the price, as were taxes and service charges.</p>
        <p>Counting the villas, the resort has a total of 419 bedrooms in 252 units. From Dec. 15 through April 15, rates range from $390 a night (double occupancy) for a standard room, to $1,190 for an Imperial Suite. In the off-season, these rates are $240 to $790 a night.</p>
        <p>The villas in high season are $780 a night for a two-bedroom with a garden view to $2,340 a night for a six-bedroom with an ocean view, a maid, butler and cook. Off-season rates are nearly 50 percent less.</p>
        <p>Reservations for Belfield 1794, on the Barnett Estate, Fairfield, Grandville, can be booked through the resort or by calling (876) 952-2382. Dinner for two with drinks was about $60. Closed Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Pork Pit restaurant is a simple place with great food on the eastern end of Montego Bay's ''hip strip,'' at 27 Gloucester Avenue; (876) 952-1046. Lunch for two with soft drinks was under $15.JENNIFER MOSES</p>
