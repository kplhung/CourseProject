        <p>Commissioner Bud Selig has heard the talk that a Subway Series will hold little allure outside New York, but from the way the phones have been ringing at Major League Baseball's offices this week, he is certain that there is little truth to it.</p>
        <p>''From listening to the news, and the ticket requests that we had in our office, without a doubt this is the most intense ticket requests I've seen in 35 years in baseball,'' he said. ''And it has come from all over the country. I've never seen more requests. The conventional wisdom that nobody west of the Hudson River is interested I think will be proven wrong and I think the ratings will show that.''</p>
