        <p>Men are seldom kind about women playing team sports. If you've ever overheard a group of them sitting in front of a big-screen TV when an ad for the W.N.B.A. comes on, it isn't pretty. But mention that a group of women in the Deep South (where every man, woman and child follows the game with Pentecostal intensity) has started a league to play professional tackle football, and you get a different reaction entirely, one of mute astonishment -- followed by slow, serious nods and mutterings of ''Now, I'd like to see that.'' Truth is, a fully suited female defensive tackle gets as much silent male respect as the 5-foot-2 housewife alighting from the driver's seat of a Dodge Ram 3500 Cummins Turbo Diesel in a supermarket parking lot. Some things are such powerful evidence of guts that they negate even gender. Tackle football is one of them.</p>
        <p>Last weekend two teams of 40 to 45 players met in the preseason opener between the Nashville Dream and the Alabama Renegades. By the time their first 10-game regular season starts in March there will be 10 more teams. Catherine Masters, founder of the National Women's Football League and owner of the Nashville Dream, estimates that 80 percent of the calls from individuals interested in shelling out the $35,000 to buy a start-up team came from women. ''In three years, we could have enough revenue to sign Marion Jones, if we play it right,'' says Masters. But for now, the players happily pocket $125 per game and call themselves pro athletes. Unlike their N.F.L. counterparts, these women of the N.W.F.L. are grown-ups, with lives and children and real jobs, as therapists, farmers, engineers and rocket scientists. Some played soccer and rugby and the like in college; others simply grew up with big brothers thumping on them day in and day out. Most of the players are blunt about what drew them to tryouts: ''The hitting.'' ''I wanted to hit people.'' ''It was the running and the hitting.''</p>

        <p>Lord knows, full-contact football is not the most ladylike of sports -- but then it isn't very gentlemanly, either. As a spectacle, football is nothing less than a hormonal apotheosis, a celebration of the feral impulse temporarily unchained. And men don't have a corner on blood, adrenaline, endorphins or even testosterone. Anyone who thinks estrogen is for sissies clearly doesn't get it.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  A picture caption in The Times Magazine last Sunday with an article about women in professional football misidentified one. The player wearing the helmet was Raven Marshall, a running back -- not Laurel Beaty, a quarterback.</p>
