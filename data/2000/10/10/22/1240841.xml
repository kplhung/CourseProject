        <p>Saying that Rosie Saferstein started her online dining forum before the Internet age is like saying Washington crossed the Delaware before the auto age. It was 10 years ago, a time when most people still communicated using a quaint hand-held instrument called the telephone, and Ms. Saferstein, a public school speech pathologist who lives in West Orange, was noodling around on her husband's new Macintosh. Before long, she discovered that Prodigy -- one of the nation's first online services -- had a bulletin board for dining in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Soon she was posting mini-reviews of New Jersey restaurants on the Prodigy board. And soon after that, she taught herself the computer language HTML, trademarked the name Food Bytes, and set herself up as the state's first online food authority.</p>

        <p>Saying that Rosie Saferstein started her online dining forum before the Internet age is like saying Washington crossed the Delaware before the auto age. It was 10 years ago, a time when most people still communicated using a quaint hand-held instrument called the telephone, and Ms. Saferstein, a public school speech pathologist who lives in West Orange, was noodling around on her husband's new Macintosh. Before long, she discovered that Prodigy -- one of the nation's first online services -- had a bulletin board for dining in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Soon she was posting mini-reviews of New Jersey restaurants on the Prodigy board. And soon after that, she taught herself the computer language HTML, trademarked the name Food Bytes, and set herself up as the state's first online food authority.</p>
        <p>Her Web site, www.foodbytes.com, no longer has any connection to Prodigy, but the idea is still the same: a place for New Jersey diners to ask one another where to get good Thai or Turkish or takeout, what's new in Hoboken, or how to deal with cell-phone users in restaurants. Ms. Saferstein also posts news about restaurants (including job openings), information about food and wine events, and her own restaurant reviews.</p>
        <p>Another difference between now and 10 years ago is that Foodbytes is no longer alone. Two other sites are eminently worth visiting.</p>
        <p>www.chowhound.com, the creation of Jim Leff, a 37-year-old jazz musician from Queens, may well be the country's most extensive Web site for passionate eaters. Its message boards are organized geographically; discussions about New Jersey restaurants can be found on boards for both the tristate region and the mid-Atlantic.</p>
        <p>New Jersey Online, the Web site of the state's three Newhouse newspapers (including The Star-Ledger of Newark), has a popular forum at www.nj.com/forums/restaurants/. In contrast to the cheery decorum that prevails at Foodbytes.com, discussions here can get cantankerous, and the moderator, Art Namendorf (a Baptist minister who goes by the Web handle The Artful Diner), sometimes has to step in and separate the participants. But after all, this is the Internet, and this is New Jersey: surely both would be poorer places without an occasional food fight.</p>
