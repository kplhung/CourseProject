        <p>THE rain is falling on Roosevelt Stadium, and Rudy Garcia is not happy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia, who represents the 57,000 residents crammed into this 1.4-square-mile city as their mayor and state assemblyman, is in the stands on a recent gray afternoon, hoping the skies will clear so that the Union Hill High School football team will take the field.</p>
        <p>The 36-year-old mayor, a former team captain and all-state running back and linebacker during his glory days at Union Hill, also simply wants to see some action out on the turf. For a time, perhaps, it will take his mind off the pressures of running a poor, landlocked city, reviewing state legislation, starting a family, facing down a recall election campaign and having state investigators subpoena documents from the local Democratic organization about his campaign finances.</p>
        <p>But the rain does not let up, and the gloomy atmosphere in the deserted stand lingers. Then someone tosses the mayor a football. Instantly, his body language changes. He becomes animated. The paunchy, prematurely graying politician, impeccably dressed in a dark blue suit, smiles the smile that is undefeated in nine primary and general elections.</p>
        <p>''This is where I grew up,'' Mr. Garcia said, with the faintest hint of an accent from his native Cuba, which he left when he was 4.</p>
        <p>Traffic whooshes by on Kennedy Boulevard outside the stadium's main entrance. ''I lived two blocks away, on 27th Street and Central,'' he said. ''Played Little League baseball, Bugs and Bees, Pop Warner football. At night time we used to come back and there used to be a men's softball league and me and my brothers would be the scorekeepers. We'd get two bucks a game.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia has come a long way since then. Likewise, his revenue-generating schemes involving the stadium have become much more ambitious. After leaving Cuba with his mother and two brothers, the young Raul Garcia, known as Rudy, eventually led Union Hill to three state championships. He went on to play for Columbia University's perennially powerless Lions while majoring in economics. Next came law school at New York University, after which he became an associate at Lord Day &amp; Lord, Barrett Smith in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>By age 28 he was tapped for a State Assembly seat from the 33rd Legislative District by his political mentor, Bruce Walter, a Hudson County power broker who had served as county Democratic chairman and mayor of Union City. When Mr. Walter died in January 1998, Mr. Garcia was chosen to fill his mentor's seat on the Union City Board of Commissioners, whose four other members also elected him mayor. In municipal elections the following May, he led a slate in winning full four-year terms.</p>
        <p>''I was, I guess, probably the fastest-rising star, not only in Hudson County politics, but probably in state politics,'' Mr. Garcia said.</p>
        <p>But in a turnaround notable even by the standards of Hudson County's perilous politics, a majority of those same commission members stripped Mr. Garcia of his positions as commissioner of public safety and of recreation -- and most of his real authority -- at the city's reorganization meeting in July, leaving him with little more than his mayor's title. And now even that is in jeopardy, with a drive under way to gather the 6,700 signatures necessary for a recall election. The move is being led by another Union City politician who over two years went from an opponent of Mr. Garcia to an ally and to an opponent again.</p>
        <p>That politician, Brian Stack, who represents Union City as a county freeholder, insists that Mr. Garcia has ignored the city's financial realities, granting raises to municipal employees and a tax cut to residents in his first year that have contributed to $12 million budget deficit. Mr. Stack has proposed himself as a candidate for mayor in a separate election that would be on the same ballot as the recall vote. It is a somewhat confusing two-tiered process that in 1995 resulted in a successful recall of Mayor Anthony DeFino of West New York -- and his re-election on the same ballot.</p>
        <p>''You know what the problem is with Rudy?'' said Mr. Stack, who gives the impression of a scrappy street fighter compared with Mr. Garcia's persona as a smooth operator. ''Everything was handed to him.''</p>
        <p>You might say that Mr. Garcia's political career began at Roosevelt Stadium, and there is a chance that it could end there. Mr. Garcia's initial name recognition grew out of his playing days, and it was while he was still in high school -- after being chosen  senior class president and captain of the football and baseball teams -- that he met his political patrons, Mr. Walter and Robert Menendez, who is now the fourth-ranking House Democrat.</p>
        <p>At that time, the two longtime allies had recently founded the Alliance Civic Organization with the purpose of breaking from another of Union City's colorful mayors, William Musto -- who was convicted of racketeering charges while in office in 1982.  Eventually, the organization would provide Mr. Garcia with his base of support. Two decades later -- in the spring of this year -- Mr. Garcia proposed selling Roosevelt Stadium, a city-owned complex, to the Union City Board of Education for $3.5 million as the main component of his plan to fill the city's current budget gap, which he put at $5 million, well below his opponents' estimate -- the sort of revenue-raising arrangement that is not uncommon in municipal finance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia said that the money to buy the stadium would have come not from local school taxes but from supplemental aid the school system receives as one of the state's 30 special needs districts.</p>
        <p>The plan appeared to have the support of the commissioners -- until officials in the State Department of Community Affairs, which reviews municipal budgets, balked. City Commissioner Rafael Fraguela called it ''voodoo economics.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Fraguela said the effort to use education funds to fill a municipal budget gap -- that should not have been allowed to develop in the first place -- was one reason Mr. Garcia should be recalled. For his part, Mr. Garcia blames Mr. Fraguela, Mr. Stack and his other opponents for scuttling the proposed stadium arrangement and thus creating the need to raise taxes.</p>
        <p>''These people can't even spell integrity,'' Mr. Garcia said, betraying what often sounds like a deep disdain for his less-educated opponents. ''They can't even think of a transaction that's going to bring $3.5 million from the state without taking any money from the board of ed, stabilizing taxes. They couldn't even think of it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia further alienated himself when he dismissed the law firm of Donald Scarinci in July 1998 as the city's outside council in what the mayor said was an effort to save tax money. Mr. Scarinci -- who accused Mr. Garcia of spending more money on legal fees the following year -- said the real reason he was fired was his longtime friendship with Mr. Menendez, whom Mr. Garcia hopes to unseat in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia makes no secret of his hopes to run for Congress. But he said that would only happen once Mr. Menendez chose to leave office. ''I've known Bob since I was 15 years old, and I have always been very supportive of him, and he was always very supportive of me. And then, unfortunately, the turning point came when I changed the municipal attorney. It used to be Donald Scarinci, his school buddy,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''And that's what changed our relationship, totally.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Menendez claimed that what he saw as Mr. Garcia's mismanagement of the city bothered him most. Moreover, he said that despite his support of Mr. Garcia in the May 1998 election, the new mayor immediately began undercutting him politically. ''My relationship with him changed the day after he got elected,'' Mr. Menendez said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez had been Union City's mayor and state senator before being elected to Congress in November 1992, and his ascension created the legislative vacancy that Mr. Garcia stepped into when Bernard Kenny, then an assemblyman from the 33rd District, moved into Mr. Menendez's State Senate seat. It was Mr. Garcia's appointment to the Assembly in January 1993 that led to his first political controversy, when opponents charged he had not lived in the 33rd District for the minimum one year before taking office. But Mr. Garcia still had the support of Mr. Menendez, Mr. Walter, and other patrons, and he emerged from the controversy unscathed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez, one of the men responsible for Mr. Garcia's rapid rise, now supports the campaign to recall the mayor. Councilman William Gaughan of Jersey City, whose political and family life overlap with Mr. Garcia's, said the mayor was learning the hard way what it is like to try to stand on his own politically.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaughan, whose daughter Eileen is close friends with Mr. Garcia's wife, Nicole, said Bruce Walter's death was a personal and political blow to his protege.</p>
        <p>''I think Rudy was really taken aback, because I don't think he was ready to step in at that point,'' said Mr. Gaughan, whose council ward, the Heights section of Jersey City, is in Mr. Garcia's legislative district.</p>
        <p>Another of the mayor's close friends, Mayor Anthony Russo of Hoboken, insisted  Mr. Garcia had been made a scapegoat by Mr. Stack and Mr. Menendez, who alternately viewed the budget deficit as a vehicle for political gain. ''I think it's unfair that they should target him,'' said Mr. Russo, who is no ally of Mr. Menendez.</p>
        <p>To add to Mr. Garcia's woes, the State Attorney General's office has subpoenaed financial records from the Union City Democratic Organization, of which Mr. Garcia was chairman before Mr. Sack ousted him in June. The office also seized city billing records for a political consultant, Pat Politano, who was hired to promote its Urban Enterprise Zone and whom critics say acted as the mayor's personal spokesman, a charge the mayor denied.</p>
        <p>Whatever he is feeling, Mr. Garcia continues to exude confidence. That much was  clear from an interview in the nursery of his infant daughter, Adriana.</p>
        <p>''I could walk away from this tomorrow and practice law and make a lot more money -- that's the difference between Stack and I in a nutshell,'' he said of his rival ''Stack's got nowhere to go.''</p>
