        <p>Salvatore Cucuzza is generally proud of the appearance of his Glendale neighborhood. But one piece of land near his house has embarrassed him for years.</p>
        <p>Instead of a sidewalk at the corner of 78th Avenue and 82nd Street, dirt, gravel, trash and overgrown vegetation line the southeast side of the avenue for nearly 15 feet. Longtime residents say the spot has never had a sidewalk, and many people have given up hope that one will be installed. Mr. Cucuzza, however, has just begun to fight.</p>
        <p>''This spot sticks out,'' said Mr. Cucuzza, who often walks around the area to avoid puddles. ''It's an eyesore and creates a dangerous situation by forcing people to walk in the middle of the street.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cucuzza, a bank administrator and Glendale real estate broker, fears that the patch of land may be a health hazard, since the puddles could be breeding spots for mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>He is also concerned that motorists could be in danger, since the street sign on the corner is loosely anchored in dirt and its direction is frequently changed by young pranksters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cucuzza has been complaining about the missing sidewalk since he moved to the area three years ago.  He has asked the Department of Transportation to correct the problem, and Community Board 5 and State Senator Serphin R. Maltese have written the agency on his behalf. The department has not responded, Mr. Cucuzza said.</p>
        <p>Tom Cocola, a Transportation Department spokesman, said he was unaware of Mr. Cucuzza's complaint.</p>
        <p>''I promise that we will investigate what happened with those letters,'' Mr. Cocola said. ''There are many sidewalk complaints and somehow this one got lost in the system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cocola said the agency had just been mailed a notice of violation to the owner of the property, a little parcel between two houses. The owner, who is Miriam Levy, according to  records, has 45 days to build the sidewalk. If the owner does not comply, the agency will install the sidewalk and bill the owner, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cucuzza said he thought the city was obliged to put in a sidewalk since, he thinks, none had ever been there. But Mr. Cocolo said that even then it was the property owner's job.</p>
        <p>The owner could not be reached for comment.</p>
