        <p>Cherry</p>
        <p>A Memoir.</p>
        <p>By Mary Karr.</p>
        <p>276 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Viking. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Mary Karr's writing belongs to the literature of escape. In ''The Liars' Club,'' her extraordinary 1995 memoir, we're aware that she's recounting her past from the perspective of elsewhere. Girls like Karr don't stay in places like Leechfield, the name she gives the swampy industrial town where she grew up on East Texas's Gulf Coast -- any more than Mary McCarthy remained in Seattle or Susan Sontag in Tucson.</p>
        <p>As childhoods go, Karr's was all twister, no Oz. Her mother was a spectacular alcoholic, given to disappearing for days at a time and to wild bouts of suicidal despair. In one episode, she tried to drive the family car off a mountain-high bridge as Hurricane Carla roared up the Intracoastal Canal. In another, she smeared lipstick all over her face and torched the family's belongings in the backyard. In both cases, Mary, then 7, and her older sister looked on. To cope, their father worked double shifts at an oil refinery and spent long hours at the American Legion hall, where he downed his own share of booze and regaled his buddies with fantastic tall tales. Is it any wonder that for Karr the highway out of town represented the yellow brick road?</p>
        <p>At the beginning of ''Cherry,'' her stunning new sequel, Karr leaves home for good at 17, piling into a battered truck with a band of surfers (one of their boards hollowed out to hold a stash of drugs) and pulls away ''from the last parental outpost'' on her way to Los Angeles, where she imagines that her ''new self -- golden and unalterable -- will gleam.'' It is part of Karr's achievement that she is able to capture the romance of the road without ever romanticizing it. When Karr talks of the ''charisma of departure,'' she's aware of the seduction involved. ''Someone should stop that truck and the future it chugs toward,'' she warns at the end of the first chapter. ''Before those six bodies in your company have hardened into adulthood, several will be cut down by drug-related obliterations. Two will take their own lives. . . . Who saw it coming? Not you, certainly.''</p>
        <p>This is all we hear, however, about this dark future. The rest of ''Cherry'' describes the far more innocent years leading up to that moment. As in the past, Karr is giving us the bad news first. In ''The Liars' Club,'' we experience her mother's disorienting insanity, as Karr did as a child, before we understand it. When her mother's terrible secret is revealed, the truth reverberates back through the book with redemptive force. ''I'll later learn,'' Karr writes, ''that this is the structure of an elegy: lament, consolation; bad news, followed by good.''</p>
        <p>But if ''The Liars' Club'' succeeded partly because of its riveting particularity, ''Cherry'' succeeds because of its universality. The first book is about one harrowing childhood, the second about every adolescence. Karr's talent doesn't depend on the specifics of her autobiography. She can turn even the most mundane events -- a first kiss, an altercation with a school principal -- into gorgeous prose. That's not to say there aren't some trademark snapshots from the Karr family album. At one point, her mother locks herself in the bathroom and threatens to shoot herself as the girls bang on the door. But the book's sexpot title is slightly misleading. Her sexual adventures, such as they are, are striking for their sweetness, and the virginity she loses is first and foremost ''pharmaceutical,'' as she puts it. Karr does an eye-popping amount of drugs in ''Cherry,'' but even in this she is typical of her generation. At the same time, her focus is honestly narrow. We hear blessedly little about the 1960's as a decade. When a best friend's brother faces serious jail time for his political activities, Karr can only muster concern by imagining herself as the star of a teary-eyed trial scene in which she provides the exculpatory testimony. ''In retrospect,'' she writes, ''such self-absorption will boggle your mind.''</p>
        <p>Writers who flee their roots often regard such youthful incarnations as distant poor relatives, deserving of disdain. This is partly what we mean when we say, ''You can't go home again.'' The new, improved self is regarded as superior to the old one. But what's remarkable about ''Cherry'' is the generosity Karr exhibits toward the awkward adolescent she once was, even as she views her with startling clarity and humor. Absent is the usual anxiety of escape, the ''shame'' Sontag once admitted to feeling the first time she met Thomas Mann, at 14, or the sense of being a fraud that the McCarthy character, in ''The Company She Keeps,'' reveals when describing her tawdry background, the sense of coming from nowhere and the vertigo it can occasion.</p>
        <p>Until recently, of course, a woman who wanted to strike out for the territories usually had to hitch her wagon to a man's. ''Most girls don't wander far unescorted,'' Karr notices in 1960's Leechfield. ''They stay home alone, or in twos and threes, waiting for boys to fetch them and jump-start some adventure.'' Karr wants to have adventures too, which classifies her as an eccentric and something of a tomboy; her ''natural enthusiasm,'' she writes, ''often outstrips social propriety.'' To stave off loneliness and boredom, she starts camping out with a bunch of surfers on the Gulf. She is more tolerated than embraced, making herself useful by learning how to roll joints and serve up speed cocktails. She's kind of a hippie happy housewife of the beach. When she later dares to paddle out on a board in California, she's greeted by shouts of ''Chick in the water'' -- ridicule designed to exile her, she writes, ''to beach-bunnyhood.'' Still, you can't help feeling that the company she keeps is less sexist and more accepting than, say, the old crowd at Partisan Review. Sometimes Doonie the surfer is prefereable to Philip Rahv.</p>
        <p>There are advantages to coming from nowhere, and one of them is the chance to flower intellectually before entering the poisonous hothouse of East Coast literary circles. ''Who cares if these surfers don't seem to read like you do?'' Karr notes. ''On more than one occasion, guys you barely know have without question driven you 30 miles to buy a pen or extra paper, never asking what you're scribbling or to whom, with no mockery inherent in the not-asking either.''</p>
        <p>A surfer's single-minded pursuit of the perfect wave is also not without its corollaries for the would-be writer. So great is Karr's thirst for literature at the time that when she comes across a poem that she particularly likes on a standardized test, she memorizes it before the test is over. Such passion isolates Karr; her sense of exile arrives before her departure. Yet like most stranded intellectuals, she has an inherent belief that somewhere, over the rainbow, sympathetic others exist. ''Surely,'' she writes, ''at least one such person lives in your zip code.'' Such a hope might seem optimistic in Leechfield. Yet in one of the book's most moving passages, Karr makes friends on the bus with a new girl, Meredith Bright, who turns out to be not only Karr's equal but a veritable genius, a teenage Edmund Wilson. When Karr, showing off, recites the poem from the test by heart, Bright chimes in, finishing the lines, and quietly announces the previously unknown author's name, ''Howard Nemerov.'' As Karr writes, ''This is data of the rarest kind. With a name you can ask your mother to find his poems in the college library,'' which she does. Karr fires off an obsequious fan letter. Nemerov writes back an encouraging note. ''Nearly 10 years later,'' Karr writes, ''he'll be lecturing in Boston, and you'll introduce yourself, and he'll shake your hand and stare with wonder and say, My God. You're that little girl from Texas.''</p>
        <p>The scene's power derives not only from the implied escape, but also from the sense of return, of coming full circle. In our age of dysfunction, most memoirs work like a carnival magic show: Come one, come all, to see the freak child transformed into best-selling author! What distinguishes Karr's writing is the sense of continuity. At one point in ''Cherry,'' a childhood friend denounces Karr as weird. Upset and hurt, she requests an explanation. Pressed, the friend finally blurts out, ''Jenny Raines is right. You really do think you're smarter than everybody else.'' Far from stung, Karr is shocked that anyone would doubt ''an opinion both my parents have hammered into me my whole life.'' Karr is clearly poking fun at her youthful arrogance, but for all her family's problems, one comes away from ''Cherry'' with a deep appreciation for the love Karr also enjoyed -- a love that gave her the confidence not only to leave Leechfield, but also to return, at least imaginatively, without shame.</p>
