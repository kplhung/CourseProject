        <p>When Columbia running back Johnathan Reese began to show flashes of greatness last season, Coach Ray Tellier switched to a one-back offense. Yesterday, Reese validated the decision with a career-defining game in the Lions' 49-21 victory over Dartmouth.</p>
        <p>Reese rushed 25 times for 236 yards to break Columbia's single-game record for most yards, as well as the season record for most yards (966).</p>
        <p>He was 2 yards short of the career record of 1,992 yards, but Tellier took Reese out of the game late in the third quarter after Reese weaved 72 yards for a touchdown to give Columbia a 42-14 lead.</p>
        <p>It was the perfect setting for Reese to finish his record pursuit. A delighted homecoming crowd of 9,289 showed up at Baker Field, and the school introduced its Team of the Century at halftime.</p>
        <p>Reese's final run of the game showed just how unstoppable he was yesterday.</p>
        <p>With the Lions leading by 35-14 late in the third quarter, Reese swept right, hesitated, and then exploded up the right sideline. With one man to beat, Reese cut back at the 30-yard line and sprinted the rest of the way for the 72-yard touchdown, his fourth of the game.</p>
        <p>On that carry, Reese eclipsed Jim O'Connor's single-game rushing mark of 225 yards, set in 1966, and Doug Jackson's season record of 914 yards, set in 1975. Reese has amassed 1,990 career yards, leaving him one burst short of Lou Kusserow's record, set in 1945-48. Reese, a 6-foot-1-inch, 210-pound junior from St. Louis, has nearly monopolized Columbia's rushing records in just two and a half injury-marred seasons.</p>
        <p>Reese helped Columbia (3-3, 1-2 Ivy) secure yesterday's game by halftime, rushing for 113 yards and scoring three touchdowns as the Lions seized a 35-14 lead. Reese also flattened a Dartmouth defender to spring Justin Logan on an 82-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second quarter. The Lions needed the boost, having surrendered two straight touchdowns after blasting out to a 21-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The Lions fumbled away their first scoring possibility and then turned into opportunists. Linebacker Kirby Mack leaped in front of Dartmouth receiver Casey Cramer to intercept Brian Mann's pass, running 40 yards to the Dartmouth 10. Reese swept into the end zone off a pitch on the next play to give the Lions a 7-0 lead early in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Dan Reed hurdled the line of scrimmage and sprinted 26 yards on the Lions' next drive to set up a 2-yard Reese touchdown run to push Columbia ahead, 14-0.</p>
        <p>Late in the first quarter, Dartmouth's Mann tried to find Cramer again -- with the same disastrous results. This time cornerback Avery Moseley stepped in front of the Big Green's tight end for the interception, giving Columbia the ball near midfield.</p>
        <p>Dartmouth devoted extra men to stop Reese and gambled elsewhere. When Columbia quarterback Jeff McCall (11 of 17 for 118 yards and 1 touchdown with 1 interception) lobbed a long pass to receiver Doug Peck, Dartmouth safety Phil Frost was so intent on keeping pace with Peck that Peck was able to stop short and reverse his field to catch the underthrown pass near the Lions' 20-yard line. Frost lunged for Peck, who escaped untouched to complete a 54-yard touchdown play.</p>
        <p>A 21-0 first-quarter lead might seem safe, but the Lions squandered a 10-point lead with two minutes left in losing to Princeton in overtime three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Dartmouth's Aaron Pumerantz rushed for two short touchdowns before Logan's kickoff return put away the game and Reese's running made school history.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>CLIFF MONTGOMERY, at age 90 the oldest living member of Columbia's 1934 Rose Bowl championship team, was introduced at halftime as a member of Columbia's Team of the Century. The late Sid Luckman (class of 1939), who had a Hall of Fame quarterback career with the Chicago Bears, and defensive end MARCELLUS WILEY (1997), who now plays for the Bills, were also named to the team.</p>
