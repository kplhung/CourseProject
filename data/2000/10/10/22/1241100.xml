        <p>As a college professor recruited to judge junior high school science project finalists in a science fair several years ago, I was dismayed to learn that if I gave the minimum score in every category, a student would still receive an ''honorable mention'' certificate.</p>

        <p>Your Oct. 18 news article about parents and teachers who overpraise children struck a chord with me.</p>
        <p>As a college professor recruited to judge junior high school science project finalists in a science fair several years ago, I was dismayed to learn that if I gave the minimum score in every category, a student would still receive an ''honorable mention'' certificate.</p>
        <p>Among those honored were students whose work demonstrated a lack of understanding of the underlying scientific concepts for their projects.</p>
        <p>I was told that the reason for awarding certificates to all participants was to encourage the students. I am pleased to learn that there is now a movement in education to praise the truly praiseworthy.</p>
        <p>ROBERT F. DRAKE  Bronx, Oct. 18, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is assistant professor of chemistry, Ramapo College.</p>
