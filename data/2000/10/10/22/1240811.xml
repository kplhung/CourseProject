        <p>When Diane Allen was a news anchorwoman in Philadelphia, she was known for wheedling information out of sources, disarming them with charm and then zeroing in for the kill, making her popular among viewers and admired among her peers.</p>
        <p>For the last five years, Ms. Allen has served Burlington County, first in the State Assembly and now in the State Senate, a staunch advocate for public education and domestic violence victims, winning as a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic district.</p>
        <p>Indeed, she has been so successful -- and respected by both parties -- that she has risen to Senate majority whip and is among those whispered about as a future gubernatorial candidate.</p>
        <p>But the combination of these two careers put Ms. Allen in the middle of a controversy last week.</p>
        <p>With Grace Hargis, an anchorwoman at CN8, a Comcast channel, about to take a two-week vacation, the news director of the Comcast cable newscast, Peggy Giordano, called Ms. Allen, a former colleague at KYW-TV in Philadelphia, and asked whether she would like to sit in while Ms. Hargis was away. Ms. Allen agreed, and CN8 executives approved the arrangement as long as Ms. Allen read no political stories and did not gather news.</p>
        <p>''We thought it would be a blast for Diane to join us for two weeks,'' said David Shane, director of original programming at CN8. ''She is not involved in any of our political coverage. She is not involved in editorial decisions or news gathering. To go a step further, we don't refer to her as a state senator.''</p>
        <p>But that wasn't enough for several New Jersey Democrats, who saw the two-week flirtation as at worst a breach of ethics and at best an attempt by Ms. Allen to gain political advantage.</p>
        <p>''There may be nothing strictly illegal about it, but it is a complete mockery of broadcast ethics,'' said Richard Codey, a Democrat from Essex County who is the Senate minority leader. ''I know politicking and I can tell you that it's not that she's making money working there, but that she is on the air. And your face on the air is what counts, so long as it doesn't say indicted under it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Codey also said the arrangement was suspect as Comcast, the parent of CN8, which is seen on 3.9 million Comcast systems from northern New Jersey to Washington's Maryland suburbs, must bid for contracts in local communities, some of which are in Ms. Allen's district.</p>
        <p>But for her part, Ms. Allen dismissed Mr. Codey's objections as politically motivated.</p>
        <p>''Being a state senator is a part-time job, and my other work is in connection with my video production company,'' she said, referring her business, called VidComm. ''So essentially, I work in TV every day.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''I have been winning in a Democratic district, and I'm sure that bugs them, so they are already coming after me a year ahead of the next election.''</p>
        <p>But even a former colleague -- who is also a former legislator -- questioned Ms. Allen's decision.</p>
        <p>''Diane is a skilled television personality, and my feelings are mixed about it,'' said Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who was a reporter for NBC News and later a one-term member of Congress from the Philadelphia suburbs. ''Her reasons for doing it may be complex, and I am the last person who should throw stones at it.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky, who today is a senior fellow at the Institute for Public Service at the Annenberg School of the University of Pennsylvania, put it this way: ''I do feel you can't go home again once you have become a partisan. To be a commentator, that is very fair. But once you say you are a Democrat or Republican, somehow to be an anchor, to be someone who is supposed to be objective, that is very difficult.</p>
        <p>''But the surprise for me is that the station would ask,'' she added. ''I can't imagine a station coming back to me and saying, 'Can you come on and be the allegedly objective person?' Maybe stations are now not worried about that, but it seems odd.''</p>
        <p>The wisdom of the television station to put itself and Ms. Allen in a potential ethical bind was also questioned by a member of her party, State Senator William Schluter a Republican from Mercer County who is the chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards.</p>
        <p>''A legislator would be hard-pressed to say no to something like that,'' said Mr. Schluter. ''But I wonder about the station, which may be faced with having to give equal time to someone from another party later. You want the media to have all appearances of being fair. But that is their call.''</p>
        <p>In his defense Mr. Shane of CN8 said he probably would not have approved Ms. Allen coming on the air had she been actively campaigning at the time.</p>
        <p>''Next year, she will be running again, I presume,'' he said. ''That would make it a much different thing.''</p>
