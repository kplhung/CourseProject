        <p>WRESTLING WITH THE ANGEL</p>
        <p>A Life of Janet Frame.</p>
        <p>By Michael King.</p>
        <p>Counterpoint, $30.</p>
        <p>For much of her career, the New Zealand writer Janet Frame published under her real name and lived under an alias, Janet Clutha. This eccentricity is typical, according to Michael King's biography, ''Wrestling With the Angel.'' After a childhood of poverty, the deaths of two young sisters and a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia, Frame, who was born in 1924, spent most of her 20's in psychiatric hospitals. She went on to lead an itinerant life during which she has so far published 22 books, including novels, collections of short stories, poetry and a children's book. (Jane Campion's film, ''An Angel at My Table,'' was based on Frame's autobiography.) King describes the ways that, for Frame, the struggle to survive and the act of writing were inseparable. For example, in 1952 she was hospitalized and scheduled to receive a lobotomy. The operation was canceled only after a doctor read in a local newspaper that Frame had won a literary award. She enjoyed a series of extraordinary friendships, beginning with her relationship with Frank Sargeson. Already an established writer in New Zealand, Sargeson gave Frame a studio in which to live and work. An American therapist, Alan Miller, was also crucial to her development, recognizing that Frame was not schizophrenic. ''Wrestling With the Angel'' is very satisfying because King, who has also written a biography of Sargeson, documents the gritty practical details of Frame's life -- tax problems, patchwork income -- as well as describing its stark emotional landscape. He quotes extensively from her letters and diaries, also conveying Frame's sense of humor: ''People say . . . 'Why don't you go out and mix?' -- as if I were a pudding.''</p>
