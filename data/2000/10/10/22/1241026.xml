        <p>Moderate leaders advocating perseverance in Arab-Israeli peace talks held the floor today at the opening session of the first summit meeting of Arab nations since 1996.

        <p>Moderate leaders advocating perseverance in Arab-Israeli peace talks held the floor today at the opening session of the first summit meeting of Arab nations since 1996. But the tone of their speeches, largely aimed at domestic audiences, was harshly critical of Israel and the perceived pro-Israeli tilt of American diplomacy.</p>
        <p>The leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia -- all countries that maintain varying degrees of diplomatic contact with Israel and relatively close relations with the United States -- paid homage to the more than 100 Palestinians killed over the last weeks in clashes with Israelis. And for the first time in a decade, Arab leaders held out the possibility of giving Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, up to $1 billion in aid.</p>
        <p>In appeals that seemed likely to carry the day when the meeting issues its final statement, however, they also sought to present peace with Israel as still the best option for transforming their impoverished region and fulfilling Palestinian dreams of independence.</p>
        <p>''We believe real peace is the only way to guarantee civility and security for the people of the region,'' said King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose father signed a peace treaty with Israel six years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, who found himself the center of attention after years of chilly relations with many of his Arab counterparts, did not ask the Arab states to turn their backs on the peace effort or break off their existing contacts with Israel.</p>
        <p>He went out of his way, in fact, to praise President Clinton as a devoted facilitator of the seven-year-old Palestinian-Israeli talks, even as many other Arab leaders rebuked the United States for failing to blame Israel for the recent bloodshed.</p>
        <p>As fighting raged today in the West Bank and Gaza and protesters in Yemen and Egypt shouted for war on Israel, Mr. Arafat delivered one of the least radical of the speeches that were televised at the start of the meeting, which conducted all its debates behind closed doors. He called for substantive international action to protect Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to castigate Israel. But he did not advocate, as did more fiery delegates, a return to war to achieve his goal of Palestinian statehood.</p>
        <p>After 10 years of punishing the Palestinian leader for his support of Iraq during the Persian Gulf war, the rich gulf states appeared ready to invest in Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia pledged $250 million for the Palestinians and called on his fellow Arabs to contribute $750 million. The money, officials said, could be used as subsidies for Palestinian residents of Jerusalem to help them stay in their homes and maintain Islamic monuments and schools.</p>
        <p>The emergency meeting of 22 Arab League nations was called in response to the spiraling violence in the Palestinian territories, which has set off widespread demonstrations of sympathy across the Arab world.</p>
        <p>The gathering was the first in 10 years to include senior Iraqi officials and provided a stage for the younger generation of leaders -- King Mohammed VI of Morocco, King Abdullah and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria -- to establish their credentials.</p>
        <p>All three are in their 30's and assumed power automatically upon the deaths of their fathers in the last two years. And all three, while condemning Israel, described peace as the Arabs' best option.</p>
        <p>The clear star was Dr. Assad of Syria, who took power in June and was untested in both Arab and international forums. He made an articulate bid to elevate Syria to its traditional place of influence in the Arab world by warning Israel and the West that Arabs would set their own terms for peace.</p>
        <p>Syria has engaged in fitful negotiations with Israel that have collapsed over its insistence on regaining every square inch of the Golan Heights that it lost during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad expressed scorn for Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who on Friday announced that he might turn away from further peace talks with the Palestinians. That statement was widely seen as a gesture to the Likud opposition party, which the politically weak Mr. Barak might need in a coalition government.</p>
        <p>The Syrian leader, in a speech that riveted the delegates, chastised the United States and Israel for characterizing Arab leaders as weak and vulnerable. He accused Mr. Barak of equivocating on peace talks to solve his domestic political troubles.</p>
        <p>''It is Israel that has the real trouble,'' he said. ''And it's not our mission to save Israel from a crisis of its own making.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Assad also took a swipe at a more senior Arab leader, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who has been trying to steer the Arab League to a temperate reaction to the violence.</p>
        <p>Referring to last week's summit meeting in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, where Mr. Clinton and Mr. Mubarak pressed Mr. Arafat to rein in Palestinian violence, the Syrian leader scoffed.</p>
        <p>''Two parties are being asked to exercise self-restraint,'' he said. ''One party has an army; the second has stones. One party is a murderer; the second is a victim. How are there two equal parties here?''</p>
        <p>Tensions with more radical factions, which reject negotiations and seek a full Arab rupture with Israel, were clearly in evidence here.</p>
        <p>Libya, represented by its ambassador to the Arab League, denounced what it called the feeble response of Arab nations to the bloodshed. About six hours after the meeting began, the Libyan delegates walked out.</p>
        <p>Iraq issued a call for what its vice president, Ezzat Ibrahim Duri, called a jihad to liberate Palestine. Like a few other nations, it also called for a boycott of all companies that do business with Israel and urged all Arab League states with ties to Israel to break them.</p>
        <p>The final statement of the meeting is expected to urge a freeze on new commercial or diplomatic contacts. That would affect just a handful of states -- Oman, Morocco, Tunisia and Qatar -- that have Israeli trade or political liaison offices in their capitals.</p>
        <p>But Arab foreign ministers, meeting ahead of today's gathering, had already recommended that any freeze exclude agreements and treaties already in effect. The exclusion would take the pressure off Egypt and Jordan, the two states with formal peace treaties with Israel.</p>
        <p>Both countries also are dependent on foreign aid from the United States, which does not want to see a reduction in the few Arab-Israeli ties that exist. Mauritania, another Arab League member that has established formal diplomatic relations with Israel, is also likely to be exempted or simply asked to downgrade its contacts.</p>
