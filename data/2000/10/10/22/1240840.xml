        <p>You don't attend a football game in helmet and pads or a swim meet in a bathing suit. But some of the 40,000 or so spectators at the Far Hills Race Meeting, the eight steeplechase races at Moorland Farms in Far Hills next Saturday, don their jodphurs and hacking jackets for the event. The highlight of the day is the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase, two and five-eights of a mile and 14 fences long; the purse is $250,000, the richest in America. People-watching is as much of a sport. Aside from the haute tweed set at their elaborate tailgate parties or the high rollers in the corporate tents, there is a younger, singles crowd who watch the horses and one another from the middle of the track. Post time for the first race is 1 p.m. Tickets are available at the gate on race day for $80, or, for $40 in advance from sites listed at www.farhillsrace. org. The beneficiary of the day is Somerset Medical Center, which since 1954 over 46 years, has garned more then $12 million from the race meeting.</p>
