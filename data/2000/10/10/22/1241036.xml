        <p>Even Roy M. Goodman acknowledges that this is the most difficult race he has faced in his 32 years in the State Senate.</p>
        <p>''I'm out here working like a salmon swimming upstream,'' he said in a recent interview. ''My dorsal fins are getting a real workout.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman, who represents the East Side of Manhattan, is the Republican Party leader in a borough that is a bastion of Democratic politics. While he is a member of the Senate's majority party during the conservative reign of Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, he remains an avowed Rockefeller Republican, a moderate who advocates gay rights and supports providing money for arts programs.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Goodman, 70, takes on his 17th race for the Senate, he is being criticized as a Republican loyal to a party leadership whose legislative goals are unpopular in an increasingly Democratic district. The most vocal critic is his opponent in the Nov. 7 election, Liz Krueger, a Democrat who has, for several years, run the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit organization that helps provide food and housing for city residents. Democrats and Republicans both acknowledge that Ms. Krueger, who is on leave from the center, has mounted a formidable campaign.</p>
        <p>The race, in the 26th Senate District, has attracted much attention in New York City and beyond, mostly because Mr. Goodman is considered to be among a group of a half-dozen or so vulnerable Republican incumbents in the upper chamber in Albany. Although Mr. Goodman has long been a prominent Republican in New York City, his margins of victory in his latest elections have eroded progressively. In the 1998 election, he had the weakest showing of any incumbent senator in the state, winning just 56 percent of the vote against a Democratic opponent whom he had outspent dramatically.</p>
        <p>And with a growing number of Democratic voters in the district, this year's contest is decidedly more fierce. Mr. Goodman has overcome Democratic majorities before, but the ratio of Democrats to Republicans among 26th District voters has grown to more than 2 to 1, with 52 percent enrolled as Democrats and 23 percent as Republicans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Krueger, 42, is a political newcomer with a long history of work with nonprofit antipoverty groups. And in a year with Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton at the top of the Democratic ticket, and with women making up nearly 60 percent of registered voters in the district, her candidacy is viewed as the strongest challenge to Mr. Goodman in many years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman suggests that he is less worried about Ms. Krueger's candidacy than he is about the potential strength of the top of the opposing ticket.</p>
        <p>''Any difficulty I have would relate to the coattails of Al Gore rather than any special qualifications of my opponent,'' he said. ''I don't wish to denigrate her, but she has no awareness of how the Legislature actually functions.''</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Goodman is campaigning with a frenzy. He has become a fixture at subway stations, greeting morning and evening commuters, and has advertised heavily on cable television.</p>
        <p>And there is far greater than average  spending in the race. Ms. Krueger, the daughter of Harvey M. Krueger, vice chairman at Lehman Brothers, the investment banking firm, has raised more than $500,000. Mr. Goodman, whose family fortune was started by his father, an immigrant and a developer of pharmaceuticals, including Ex-Lax, has raised more than $1.5 million. The Republicans, who have a six-seat edge in the Senate, do not want their strength eroded and are contributing to Mr. Goodman's campaign through the Senate Campaign Committee.</p>
        <p>Both campaigns have mailed a barrage of literature to district residents, and both have advertised heavily on buses and appeared at countless local forums.</p>
        <p>The Democrats say they share the Republicans' view of this race as  critical. The difference is that they talk hopefully about the possibility of embarrassing the Republicans with the loss of a seat and even the chances of gaining control of the Senate.</p>
        <p>Democrats from far and near have flocked to Ms. Krueger's side. A week ago, four city Democrats who have indicated that they plan to run for mayor next year -- the public advocate, Mark Green; the comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi; the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone; and the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer -- appeared together on a district street corner,  donning aprons and serving coffee to passers-by on Ms. Krueger's behalf.  She regularly serves coffee on the streets throughout the district, inviting voters to ''Help wake up the State Senate. Elect Liz Krueger.''</p>
        <p>In speaking to potential voters, the  candidates offer distinctly different messages. Ms. Krueger, whose campaign mantra proclaims, ''It's time for a change,'' portrays Mr. Goodman as a well-intentioned official who nonetheless supports a leadership that often votes against the interests of New York City.</p>
        <p>''We want Albany to have a sense of reality about what's happening in New York City,'' she said in a recent interview. ''We need access to health care for all New Yorkers. Where is the public transportation system that our city needs and deserves? Where is the public education system that we need? What happened to the $1.46 billion a year we get shortchanged, year in and year out, by the State Senate's formula for funding for education?''</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Goodman, Ms. Krueger said: ''He's been there for 32 years. We're getting a Republican who supports Joe Bruno, who votes for Joe Bruno and with Joe Bruno. He will actually vote against his own progressive bills when asked to by the leadership.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman presents himself as the moderate voice of the Senate, highlighting his sponsorship of more than 1,000 bills and his role as a supporter -- and political patron -- of arts groups in the city. He discusses his sponsorship of the law that imposes harsher sentences on criminals in New York who single out their victims on the basis of sexual orientation, race, religion or age.</p>
        <p>He discusses his support for a ban on assault weapons, for increased state funding for New York City public schools and for providing Medicaid money for low-income women who have abortions. Mr. Goodman denied that he had ever followed the dictates of the leadership in Albany to the point of voting against a bill he had sponsored. Instead, he said, he has often supported the Republican leadership on procedural votes that determine when certain bills emerge from committee. ''I don't speak with a forked tongue, saying one thing here and doing another elsewhere,'' he said. ''I am consistent.''</p>
        <p>Although both candidates have raised significant amounts of money and have been embraced by their party organizations, their styles and histories are dramatically different.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman, who received an undergraduate degree and an M.B.A. from Harvard University, is an eloquent speaker with a professorial air. After selling the family pharmaceutical business, he worked as the city's finance commissioner and treasurer under Mayor John V. Lindsay, and was persuaded, in part by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, to run for the State Senate in 1968. He was the Republican mayoral candidate in 1977, losing to his Democratic opponent, Edward I. Koch.</p>
        <p>Ms. Krueger graduated from Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, where she received a master's degree in public policy. Her first job in New York was organizing a food bank in the South  Bronx, and she has been involved with antipoverty organizations ever since. She says her expertise in government financing of food and housing for the poor is needed in the Legislature.</p>
        <p>The 26th District includes some of the city's wealthiest areas. It runs from East 14th Street to East 97th  Street, generally from the East River to Fifth Avenue above 59th Street and east of Broadway below 59th  Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman, who earlier this year lost an internal Republican race to become a delegate for George W. Bush, said his own polling information showed that he had enough support to win.</p>
        <p>Ms. Krueger, who won a lopsided victory in a Democratic primary against Robert J. Bellinson, the candidate who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Goodman in 1998, said that she, too, had widespread support for her campaign.</p>
        <p>''The feedback on the street has been fantastic,'' she said. ''People seem to like my positions on the issues. People tell me that they see me as a real person, and that I don't seem like a politician. That's the best thing.''</p>
