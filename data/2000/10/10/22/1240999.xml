        <p>GREEN ketchup, announced with great fanfare months ago, is starting to arrive in stores. But it's not gathering dust. Store owners and their customers can't get it fast enough, said Casey Keller, managing director at H. J. Heinz for ketchup, condiments and sauces.</p>
        <p>''People have offered me $10 for a bottle,'' he said. ''Now I know what it must be like in the toy industry when they have a hit on their hands.'' Heinz now projects that a year's worth of the new ketchup will probably be sold in the first 90 days.</p>
        <p>The suggested retail price is $1.79 for 24 ounces.</p>
        <p>In development for nearly a year -- Mr. Keller would not reveal that cost -- the green ketchup comes in a new, softer, child-friendly bottle inspired by research among children 3 to 12.</p>
        <p>''Kids told us they had a hard time using the regular bottle,'' Mr. Keller said. ''They also suggested having ketchup in a different color. That threw us for a loop.''</p>
        <p>Green was the color they wanted. The new squeeze bottle will let them draw or write on their food, to decorate each French fry and make patterns on their burgers. Red ketchup is also being sold in the new bottle. ''It's the first step in making ketchup fun,'' said Mr. Keller, who did not rule out other colors in the future.</p>
        <p>The green ketchup tastes exactly like the red. The difference is the addition of food coloring -- blue No. 1 aluminum lake and yellow No. 5. Mr. Keller said Heinz had received no negative reactions from parents about the coloring.</p>
        <p>The new ketchup in the new bottles has also been bolstered with vitamin C. So with a green color and added nutrient value, does ketchup qualify as a vegetable after all, as the Agriculture Department once proposed during the Reagan administration? Probably not. When was the last time vegetables were fun?</p>
