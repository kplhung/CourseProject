        <p>It happened Tuesday on a campaign stop like thousands of others being held around the city in this hectic election year. In the basement of Calvary Presbyterian Church on the North Shore, two candidates for the State Assembly had just unspooled their spiels for the West Brighton chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons.</p>
        <p>One member of the audience dozed. Others sank their chins into their collarbones.</p>
        <p>Then Katina Johnstone stepped up to the microphone. Ms. Johnstone, 50, is not a polished speaker. She gazes down to think between sentences and scratches the back of her head. But Ms. Johnstone, a Democrat who is running for office in the 13th Congressional District, which covers Staten Island and Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, has a story to tell. And when she gets rolling, she is transformed from awkward to riveting.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnstone starts by talking about her husband, David. Eight years ago, while walking through a quiet neighborhood during a business trip to San Francisco, the 43-year-old book editor was followed by three teenage boys, one of whom pulled out a .38 revolver. The gun went off, and Mr. Johnstone was shot in the back, severing his spinal cord and damaging major organs. He died a month later.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Johnstone lays out the facts of her husband's death, several people in the audience let out muffled gasps. Then she draws a conclusion: ''Congress has failed to regulate the sale, manufacture, distribution and possession of firearms.''</p>
        <p>Like Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a Democratic political neophyte who catapulted to fame after her husband, Dennis, was killed by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road, this first-time candidate is making gun control her main issue.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnstone, who is on leave from her job as a director of the Million Mom March Coalition, a gun control lobbying group, sometimes compares herself to Ms. McCarthy. But unlike the death of Dennis McCarthy, the death of David Johnstone did not receive extensive press coverage. As a result, Ms. Johnstone has set out to tell her tale repeatedly to audiences in the district she hopes to represent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnstone's opponent is Representative Vito Fossella, a popular Republican who got 65 percent of the vote in 1998. In conversation after her speech, Ms. Johnstone criticized him for accepting campaign donations from the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>Craig Donner, a spokesman for Mr. Fossella, said his candidate had received $4,000 from the N.R.A. since 1998, but, he added, gun control was not the only issue in the election.</p>
        <p>''Thousands of people across Staten Island and Brooklyn support Vito,'' Mr. Donner said, ''because of his strong record in protecting Social Security and Medicare, reducing taxes, giving parents more control over their children's education and increasing penalties on criminals.''</p>
        <p>Mimi Cucchiara, 76, who attended the candidates' forum, said she found Ms. Johnstone's speech ''very stimulating'' and planned to vote for her. But when told who Ms. Johnstone's opponent was, Ms. Cucchiara replied, ''Oh, I like Fossella.''</p>
