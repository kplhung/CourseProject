        <p>A carriage horse company is setting up a stable next door to Public School 51, and parents are worried about schoolchildren breathing in the stable's dust and odors as well as being distracted by the clip-clopping of carriages. The city has promised to keep the arrangement temporary, however, and says the stable will be a good neighbor.</p>
        <p>The city recently signed a license agreement to allow Shamrock Stables to move into a long-vacant garage at 522 West 45th Street in mid-December while it repairs the F.D.R. Drive at 61st Street, where Shamrock has spent the last 30 years, said Denise Collins, a spokeswomen for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services.</p>
        <p>Shamrock's owner was out of town last week and unavailable for comment, but employees said the company would try to address the parents' concerns.</p>
        <p>Parents like Aliyah Triggs-Farmer, president of the school's Parents and Teachers Association, do not want the stable because students are already complaining about noise and fumes from a neighboring railway track and tour bus depot. Ms. Triggs-Farmer is also worried because her two children, who are severely asthmatic, will be playing in a schoolyard that abuts the indoor stable. (The P.T.A. is to take up the issue at its regular meeting Tuesday in the school cafeteria.)</p>
        <p>''Kids like anything that fascinates them, and kids love horses,'' Ms. Triggs-Farmer said on Thursday. ''But they don't see the hidden dangers, and parents do. A horse stable will bring more dust and fumes and noise, and there's the risk of a horse getting loose. It would be devastating.''</p>
        <p>But the city is leasing the garage to Shamrock monthly specifically so it can watch for problems, Ms. Collins said. She also said the stable would be gone in six months to a year, when the road repairs are  completed.</p>
        <p>''We know there is a school next door, and there is an array of agencies that will be making sure they hold up to all regulations,'' Ms. Collins said. ''This is an interim solution.''</p>
        <p>City Councilwoman Christine Quinn is not convinced.</p>
        <p>''Interim is the same thing as 'last word' in city government,'' Ms. Quinn said. ''But even in the best world, that's six months of disrupted schooling. And for some struggling students, six months can be a lifetime.''</p>
