        <p>Marjorie McAllister and John F. Toner were married on Friday by Msgr. John Torney at the Roman Catholic Church of St. Thomas More in New York.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Toner, 74, is known as Meg. She retired as the director of early childhood education for the New York City Board of Education. She graduated from the College of New Rochelle and received a master's degree in early childhood education from Brooklyn College.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toner, also 74, works in New York as the vice president for marketing at Avondale Mills, a textiles manufacturer. He graduated from Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Md.</p>
        <p>The couple first met on a blind date almost 60 years ago, in November 1940. Both were 14 and had been brought together by one of Ms. McAllister's cousins, who was a friend of Mr. Toner's.</p>
        <p>''We dated through high school, and then I entered the service,'' Mr. Toner said. ''When I got out of the service and went to college, we dated again. But around 1950, I started my business career, and moved out to St. Louis. Our lives went in different directions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Toner married another woman and lived with her for 34 years until her death, four years ago. Ms. McAllister, who never married, pursued her career in education in New York.</p>
        <p>''But we always kept in touch,'' Ms. McAllister said. ''Our families knew one another. He and I would exchange Christmas cards and see each other at weddings and funerals. We always knew where the other one was, but there was no romance.''</p>
        <p>Then, during the holiday season of 1998, two years after the death of his wife, Mr. Toner wrote to Ms. McAllister and said he traveling on vacation to Palm Beach, Fla., where she was living in retirement. The reunion went well, and there quickly ensued an intense exchange of letters, phone calls and eventually visits. Two months ago Mr. Toner proposed to her in his home in New Canaan, Conn.</p>
        <p>''We are both avid golfers, and he had wanted to propose on a golf course, but couldn't figure out how to put the ring in a hole without someone taking it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Although we first met 60 years ago, everything from proposal to marriage happened at breakneck speed,'' the bride continued. ''At 74, you don't fool around.''</p>
