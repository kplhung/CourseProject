        <p>Venturing gingerly into the church-state divide, the City Council and the Manhattan borough president have awarded $1 million toward the rehabilitation of the landmark Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side.</p>
        <p>City officials said they made the decision, which is to be announced tomorrow, on the grounds that the ornate 113-year-old building, the first great synagogue built in America by Eastern European Jews, was of general historic interest and offered an array of public programs.

        <p>Venturing gingerly into the church-state divide, the City Council and the Manhattan borough president have awarded $1 million toward the rehabilitation of the landmark Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side.</p>
        <p>City officials said they made the decision, which is to be announced tomorrow, on the grounds that the ornate 113-year-old building, the first great synagogue built in America by Eastern European Jews, was of general historic interest and offered an array of public programs. The programs and the building restoration are run by the nonsectarian Eldridge Street Project.</p>
        <p>But the building is also the home of an Orthodox congregation formed by merger that is known as K'hal Adath Jeshurun with Anshe Lubz. The fact that it is a functioning house of worship may raise constitutional questions, even as officials envision more municipal support for religious landmarks.</p>
        <p>''It hopefully opens a discussion of state funding for very significant religious properties that have not just religious value but are an important part of the landscape,'' said the chairwoman of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, Jennifer J. Raab.</p>
        <p>Religious leaders have long complained that once their buildings are made landmarks -- on the theory that they contribute to the civic fabric -- the government refuses to help maintain them for fear of violating the Constitution.</p>
        <p>But the Eldridge Street Synagogue, because of its ''very special nature,'' was viewed differently, said C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president.</p>
        <p>''There was a willingness to look at this in a different light,'' she said. ''There was not the usual response of, 'This is a religious institution, so don't even explore it.' ''</p>
        <p>Half of the $1 million award came from the borough president's budget, the other half from the City Council.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is that we get to keep a significant city landmark and a gorgeous building,'' said Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, whose district includes the block between Canal and Division Streets on which the synagogue stands. The money, she said, will not be used for religious purposes.</p>
        <p>Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who represents much of the Lower East Side, said the appeal of the Eldridge Street Synagogue transcended religion.</p>
        <p>''When you stand in front of it, you become part of it,'' she said, confessing to a 22-year ''love affair'' with the synagogue that began almost as soon as she arrived in New York from Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter what religion you are, the building does something to you,'' Ms. Lopez said. ''For some reason, every brick, every window is talking to your soul. This is a perfect example of art in architecture. It would be a travesty of justice for anyone to let this be lost.''</p>
        <p>And it almost was lost in the 1980's. The small congregation, which had moved out of the lavish main sanctuary and into a modest ground-floor space, could not possibly maintain the enormous structure, which was near collapse.</p>
        <p>The Eldridge Street Project was founded in 1986 by Roberta Brandes Gratz, a writer on urban affairs, and has raised $4.5 million to stabilize the building and make it safe, though it can scarcely be called comfortable yet, particularly in winter. She said the city money would go toward infrastructure.</p>
        <p>''We have a patched-together little heating system that heats the downstairs sanctuary and the squeezed-in offices,'' said Ms. Gratz, who is to be honored tomorrow at the dinner where the award will be announced, at Chelsea Piers on the Hudson River. ''Whatever light we have upstairs is strung together by extension cords. We've never been able properly to use the sanctuary.</p>
        <p>''We've done a lot, God knows, in half steps,'' she said. ''But you can't put in half a heating system.''</p>
        <p>The synagogue project has already received smaller amounts of government funding from federal, state and city agencies, including  $250,000 from the state Environmental Quality Bond Act in 1990.</p>
        <p>But Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the new award seemed ''constitutionally suspect,'' based on a brief description. ''It sounds like they're giving public money to the synagogue,'' he said, which would violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment (''Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion'').</p>
        <p>Not in the view of Paul P. E. Bookson, a retired State Supreme Court judge, former New York senator and, like his grandfather, a member of the Eldridge Street congregation.</p>
        <p>''The government is not contributing this money to the congregation,'' he said. ''That building incorporates a multitude of activities above and beyond the expression of religious belief and faith.''</p>
        <p>By that, he meant services like food, emergency shelter, job counseling, apartment referrals, education and no-interest loans that the congregation provided -- and not only to Jews -- long before government got into the social welfare business.</p>
        <p>''All those years, the synagogue served in all these capacities without any official governmental help,'' Mr. Bookson said. ''This really represents, from my view, a closing of the circle.''</p>
