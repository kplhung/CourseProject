        <p>Daniel Snyder, the Washington Redskins' owner, has quickly made enemies among a significant number of owners in the National Football League. But suddenly Snyder is beginning to irritate the league office as well, and now comes the possibility Washington could be fined a draft pick if Snyder continues what the N.F.L. views as an arrogant disregard for one of its rules.</p>
        <p>The Redskins have already been quietly fined twice by the N.F.L. for violating league stadium-noise edicts -- and there could be more penalties.</p>
        <p>Snyder, who purchased the Redskins almost two years ago for $800 million, has his positive attributes. He cares about the team, wants to win, and his off-season spending spree -- as well as the hiring of Vinny Cerrato as the team's general manager -- are the main reasons the Redskins are 5-2 and leading the National Conference East.</p>
        <p>But many in the N.F.L. insist that there is also a lot not to like about Snyder. They cite as an example his recent petulant behavior regarding certain league rules.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time Snyder has caught the attention of fellow owners and others in the league. When he first took over the Redskins, Snyder fired about two dozen employees, including a number of secretaries. This summer he began the unprecedented move of charging fans for admission to training camp.</p>
        <p>Snyder is also seen as meddlesome by many within his own organization. The week before Washington played the Giants on Sept. 24, Norv Turner, the head coach, was pressured by Snyder to play backup quarterback Jeff George over starter Brad Johnson, and Snyder told wide receiver Albert Connell that he would be more involved in the offense, according to a Redskins assistant coach. Those types of actions by an owner tend to undermine the coaching staff. Why should players listen to a coach if they view the owner as the one making the football decisions?</p>
        <p>But what the Redskins did to the Ravens last week has the N.F.L. irate with Snyder perhaps more than ever, and his Redskins facing yet another league-imposed sanction.</p>
        <p>The Redskins, like many teams, use music and other noise to fire up the home crowd. But league rules state that teams are supposed to cease any artificially generated sound once an opposing offense breaks the huddle or approaches the line of scrimmage.</p>
        <p>The rule is there for obvious reasons: Blasting music can drown out a quarterback trying to give signals to his teammates. Yet the Redskins consistently had their live band play as the Ravens broke the huddle, and even as quarterback Tony Banks started barking the plays.</p>
        <p>It turns out this is not the first time the Redskins have been accused of cheating the rule. Two teams, including Tampa Bay, have complained about the Redskins' use of similar tactics. The Buccaneers filed a protest with the N.F.L. after their Oct. 1 game with Washington. Since it was the Redskins' second offense -- it is unknown which organization was the first to complain -- the team was fined $20,000. The league is investigating the latest possible violation.</p>
        <p>If the Redskins are found to have broken the rule a third time, they could be fined again, and a fourth violation may cost them a draft pick.</p>
        <p>But the Redskins organization acted like a spoiled 2-year-old throughout that day against Baltimore. When the Ravens arrived at FedEx Field on team buses, they were charged for parking. While charging a visiting team for parking does not violate N.F.L. rules, such behavior is considered extremely boorish.</p>
        <p>Washington officials later apologized and offered to reimburse the Ravens the $120 in parking fees, but only after the Redskins' action became public.</p>
        <p>Also that day, in the minutes before the game, a Redskins announcer yelled a vulgar remark about Ravens fans over the public-address system. The sophomoric tactics continued after kickoff. The Redskins would not announce the names of Ravens starters before the game, a practice that has been customary in the N.F.L. The Redskins also refused to announce any Ravens player who made a tackle or offensive play during the game.</p>
        <p>It took the Oakland owner, Al Davis, a lifetime to irk the N.F.L. and the Dallas owner Jerry Jones a matter of years. But it has taken Snyder just a few months.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't angry, I was embarrassed for the league as a whole,'' the Ravens' owner, Art Modell, said in his first public comments about that day. ''I don't understand how the Redskins get away with it. They play by their own rules. Can you imagine me doing all those things to Wellington Mara or the Rooney family? I would never show another owner or another team such disrespect.</p>
        <p>''I would be deeply disappointed if Dan Snyder instructed his people to do these things. This is something that no responsible owner would ever ask his team to do. I hope he objects to it and does not condone it. But so far I have not heard him come out and say, 'I had nothing to do with these things and they were wrong.' ''</p>
        <p>Snyder's spokesman, Karl Swanson, said Snyder does not submit to interviews during the season. Swanson said that the Redskins apologized for the comment from the announcer about Ravens fans.</p>
        <p>Ravens officials believe that the Redskins' actions stem from a dispute this summer involving the two teams. Snyder violated a longstanding gentleman's agreement between owners that competing teams would not advertise in each other's market by advertising in Baltimore. ''If the Redskins ever come to our stadium they will be treated with respect,'' Modell said. ''We would never treat them the way they treated us.''</p>
        <p>Snyder recently watched a playoff game with the Yankee owner, George Steinbrenner, who has been known to be a tad ruthless himself. Was Steinbrenner giving the young Snyder a few tips?</p>
        <p>Or was it the other way around?</p>
        <p>Giants Question 2 Calls</p>
        <p>This season the N.F.L. has informed the Giants -- twice -- that officials made erroneous calls during two Giants games. That means that even though Coach Jim Fassel is 0-7 when it comes to instant-replay challenges, he actually might have a slightly more favorable record.</p>
        <p>What errors the league admitted are not known. The Giants will not comment and if they revealed their discussions with league officials on the matter, the team could be fined. The N.F.L. will also not comment.</p>
        <p>Teams occasionally submit a list of plays where there were questionable calls and ask for an explanation. The N.F.L. analyzes the film and informs the team that officials made either the right call or a mistake.</p>
        <p>Titans Handle Zone Blitz</p>
        <p>There are many reasons the Tennessee Titans have emerged as a favorite to reach the Super Bowl again, and one reason is not publicly well known. Coaches say the Titans have mastered defending the complicated zone-blitz attack.</p>
        <p>A perfect example of how Tennessee's solid play-calling and disciplined offensive schemes makes the Titans the best against the zone blitz occurred in the team's victory over Jacksonville last Monday. The Jaguars ran a blitz to the right, and running back Eddie George swung out to the left, opposite the blitz.</p>
        <p>Because Jacksonville had sent so many bodies, 257-pound defensive lineman Tony Brackens was left to cover George, who has sprinter speed. That is a mismatch. George broke the pass for a big gain.</p>
        <p>Every team runs some type of zone-blitz defense, but A.F.C. Central teams run it the most and the best, and Tennessee defends against it better than anyone. Why? One reason is they have a weapon in George, and the best way to defend against the zone blitz is to run against it.</p>
