        <p>AROUND here, we are nothing if not grandiose. The first Subway Series game since 1956 became -- what else? -- the longest game in World Series history.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won their 13th straight World Series game, 4-3, in the 12th inning early this morning on Jose Vizcaino's bases-loaded single.</p>
        <p>The plot was so complicated as to promise great and bizarre events in the games to come, if the players and the city have any energy left after 4 hours 51 minutes of mood swings.</p>
        <p>The whole idea of the first game of the World Series -- particularly one played in Subwayland, where there will be no forgetting -- is not to be embarrassed, not to set some kind of negative trend.</p>
        <p>You can lose, but don't lose sloppily, or even worse, don't lose sleepily. For a team in the first World Series game of its generation, the Mets were remarkably lackadaisical last night, dawdling themselves right out of two early innings.</p>
        <p>And that wasn't the worst part. Their bullpen failed. Armando Benitez blew a save in the ninth inning and the collective others failed later.</p>
        <p>This is not one of those long-distance World Series, where the mood of one ballpark has nothing to do with the mood in the other ballpark. This is all taking place on the IRT line of the city subway system. This is all rather personal, for the fans, at any rate.</p>
        <p>The participants prefer to think of this as not merely the Subway Series, that bloated creature of New York's vivid self-importance.</p>
        <p>''It means that it's the end of October, and the best team in the National League is playing against the best team in the American League,'' said Manager Bobby Valentine of the Mets, whose moves paid off last night.</p>
        <p>''It's a World Series,'' Valentine added, emphasis heavy on the first word.</p>
        <p>In the long run, most fans will have to dig deep to remember the emotion of a World Series that matched Queens against the Bronx. However, what these players do will live forever in the record books and in the legends.</p>
        <p>Wellington Mara, the 84-year-old gentleman who owns half the football Giants, said last week that he thought he remembered Casey Stengel lumbering homeward on an inside-the-park home run in the ninth inning, which gave the baseball Giants a 5-4 victory in the first Series game ever played in Yankee Stadium in 1923. Mara was there. The question is whether he remembers it, or whether it was reinforced by hearing about it from his elders over the years.</p>
        <p>It's a nice memory. It's also intriguing to think that what happens this week will be remembered three quarters of a century later. This goes beyond the Willets Point or 161st Street stations. This is for the cosmos.</p>
        <p>The players know there is the potential for infamy as well as fame, but most assume nothing bad will ever happen to them.</p>
        <p>Before this Subway Series business is over, some New York baseball player could be remembered as a Bill Mazeroski or a Joe Carter, who finished off a World Series with a single swing, or a Mickey Owen or a Bill Buckner, who had balls go past them at wretched moments.</p>
        <p>The Mets had some sloppy moments last night. For all the scouting reports and the empirical observation of Andy Pettitte's move to first base, Mike Piazza found himself shambling in the wrong direction in the fourth inning and was promptly caught off first base.</p>
        <p>In that same inning, Todd Zeile didn't bother to run as his little nubber corkscrewed itself back into fair territory near third base, and he was out by more than he should have been.</p>
        <p>But the really inappropriate nonchalance came in the sixth when Timo Perez was on first with two outs. Zeile lofted a drive to left field and promptly pumped his arm as if he'd done something wonderful. Perez felt the same way, and meandered his way past second base.</p>
        <p>Tough. The ball landed with a soft thud on the protective padding at the top of the wall, and a perfect relay to home caught Perez, who by that time had decided to run hard, albeit belatedly.</p>
        <p>Had any fan touched the ball, the umpire -- on Jeffrey Maier alert -- would probably have signaled a home run. But the pro-Yankee crowd kept its hands off the ball, and was paid for its self-discipline.</p>
        <p>It is never a a good idea to give the Yankees a huge break in their own ballpark.</p>
        <p>In the ninth inning, gallant but struggling Paul O'Neill, swinging clumsily early in the count, got to a full count and fouled off four pitches before walking. That set up an eventual sacrifice fly by Chuck Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>There are no guarantees. The World Series is its own little crap shoot. Wonderful things and awful things have happened in the World Series that had nothing to do with the subway system. Just don't tell that to anybody with ''NY'' on his ball cap and extravagant head twitches and a very loud voice. He thinks he's at the center of the universe. And last night, that's exactly what it seemed.</p>
