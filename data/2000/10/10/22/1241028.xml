        <p>Vojislav Kostunica, the new Yugoslav leader, will visit Sarajevo on Sunday for the first such visit by a Yugoslav president since Bosnia declared independence in April 1992 and a three-and-a-half-year war followed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's visit was hastily organized to avoid tension over what he has stressed is a private visit to the Bosnian Serb town of Trebinje earlier on Sunday for the reburial of a revered Serbian poet, Jovan Ducic, who was born in Trebinje and died in the United States in 1943.</p>
        <p>Wolfgang Petritsch, the Austrian diplomat who runs Bosnia on behalf of the foreign powers that have poured in billions of dollars of aid since the war ended in December 1995, met Mr. Kostunica on Friday and made clear that he thought it unwise for the new Yugoslav leader to visit any part of the Bosnian Serb republic without visiting Sarajevo, which was besieged and bombarded throughout the war by the Bosnian Serbs.</p>
        <p>''I shared my thoughts with him that it will be the first time he would cross the border and, according to longstanding diplomatic procedure, a visit to the capital would be the preference,'' Mr. Petritsch said on Friday. He added that Mr. Kostunica's avoidance of Sarajevo could also inflame passions ahead of Bosnian elections in November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, a moderate nationalist who has condemned ethnic cleansing and the use of paramilitaries who often carried it out, told Mr. Petritsch that he recognized the Dayton accords that brought peace to Bosnia, respected Bosnia's sovereignty and was ready to establish diplomatic relations with his neighbor. He added that he did not think the visit to Trebinje would be interpreted as a slight on Bosnia's sovereignty or borders, according to an official who took part in his meeting with Mr. Petritsch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica will visit only the airport in Sarajevo, meeting there with the Serbian chairman of the tripartite Bosnian presidency and the presidency's Croatian and Muslim members for about 40 minutes, according to Jacques Klein, the United Nations representative in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein described Mr. Kostunica's visit as ''historical and symbolic,'' Agence France-Presse reported.</p>
