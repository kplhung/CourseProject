        <p>COLLEGE as a networking opportunity. The Internet as a protective screen, through which performance trumps age and inexperience. Trading the leisure of youth for the chance to make an impact -- and wondering whether it is worth it.</p>
        <p>These themes emerged when four college-age founders of fledgling technology companies gathered in Boston to talk with Money &amp; Business about the entrepreneurial urge that strikes many members of their generation. Drawn from three colleges in the Boston area and from companies at different stages of development, they had the common experience of being undergraduates and senior executives simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Gut, 21, started CollegiateMall.com, an Internet retailing company, during his sophomore year at Boston University, because he found the process of acquiring beanbag chairs and other trappings of college life frustrating and inefficient. He returned to school this fall as a senior after taking a year off to get his company off the ground, but he continues to serve as chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mykolas Rambus, 21, chief executive of Lobby 7, a wireless services company, graduated last spring from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the other four founders of the company, which they ran from a dormitory room during their final semester. Now based in Boston, Lobby 7 has obtained venture capital from i-Group, an affiliate of Softbank, and is now working to raise its next round of financing.</p>
        <p>Greg Y. Tseng, 20, a senior at Harvard, started FlyingChickens.com, a price-comparison Web site, after finding that he could save $40 by buying a physics textbook online. With the motto ''fly the coop,'' challenging students to abandon the campus's main bookstore, the Harvard Coop, Mr. Tseng introduced his site during the summer after his sophomore year. The company has since merged with Limespot, a Web portal for college students that was founded by a student at Cornell University; Mr. Tseng is now chief operating officer of Limespot.</p>
        <p>Alastair Rampell, 19, is a junior at Harvard and the chief executive of Rampell Software, which provides a variety of software products and consulting services to consumers and corporate clients. Mr. Rampell began writing computer programs when he was in the fourth grade, and his program designed to ensure a lasting connection to America Online won him a significant following during notorious network overload problems in late 1996.</p>
        <p>Around a conference-room table with Amy Harmon and Kevin McKenna of The Times on a sunny fall morning, they explored their experiences of entrepreneurial precocity. Following are excerpts of that wide-ranging conversation.</p>
        <p>The Lure of E-Commerce</p>
        <p>Q. -- What is it about the Internet that leads so many more young people to start companies?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- People in general take me more seriously because of the Internet. On the Internet, everything is age-blind. It's ethnic-blind. It's religion-blind. If you send an e-mail to somebody, you just see a company; if they are going to do a good job, that's all that matters.</p>
        <p>I don't think I would have gotten hired to do some things that I did at age 13, had they known I was 4 foot 11. I had only been doing this for about a year and a half, but they didn't know that.</p>
        <p>GUT -- When I started CollegiateMall, I was faking being a big company. The first four or five months, I had fake e-mail accounts, and I had six fake ''employees'' that would send e-mails to other people at companies. What's so neat about the Internet is that you can really front things -- not to deceive people, but, for example, when people wanted customer service, they'd e-mail ''customer service,'' and ''customer service'' sends back an e-mail.</p>
        <p>That same e-mail could not come from me as president -- it just wouldn't make sense. So I would send an e-mail that would come from, you know, Joe Whatever, the customer service manager.</p>
        <p>Shoppers on my site, for the most part, have the same experience that you can get on Amazon -- you order product; it shows up within a week. They're saving a lot of money, the customer service is good, and I'm not nearly the size of Amazon.</p>
        <p>Q. -- What made you decide to start a company now, when you're supposed to be going to class and having fun before hitting the real world?</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- I started my first business when I was in 10th grade, so business has always been sort of a given. It wasn't a matter of if, but when, and it didn't make sense to wait.</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- I started programming originally to fix things that I didn't like. And then I saw that there was an enormous business potential. The margins on software are unbelievable, because there are no marginal costs whatsoever.</p>
        <p>GUT -- When I was 9 years old and living in North Carolina, I invented this product called ''Zip Cord.'' It was like a fashion accessory, and we sold it in 37 states and 3 countries. So I very early learned the thrill and excitement of starting a business. And then 10 years later, when I was in college, you couldn't help but see the Internet was revolutionizing business. I guess I just naturally saw an opportunity where I thought I could make money.</p>
        <p>TSENG -- Most companies fail, and an even a greater percentage of first-timers fail. So if you're going to start your first company, it's a lot better to do it in college, so that if you fail, you're still in college. I mean, we're still Harvard students; it's not like we're, you know, toast. But if you are 40 and married with kids and a mortgage, and you fail with your first company, what are you going to do then?</p>
        <p>Hearing Older Voices</p>
        <p>Q. -- How did your parents and instructors react? Did anyone in your life counsel you to just concentrate on school?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- My mom said that every day. She still does.</p>
        <p>GUT -- I thought that the smartest thing was to take a leave of absence. My parents and family and close friends were all very supportive of what I was doing, but I still wasn't totally sure. Leaving school is a big decision, and when I contacted professors, a lot of them were like: ''Don't leave. It's the wrong thing to do. You're riding on a technology wave that's going to crash and you're going to get burned.''</p>
        <p>But I went back to my parents, and they said, ''You're doing something that's working -- stick with it.'' So that's what I did.</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- I stopped really focusing on school in my sophomore year. I went to two or three lectures for certain classes. I just spent time working with the resources at M.I.T. -- there's a vast array of networking opportunities, contacts you can make through professors, events to attend in the venture community. So I spent most of the past three years prior to graduation doing stuff like that, rather than focusing on classes.</p>
        <p>Q. -- What happened to your grades?</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- They weren't all that bad until last semester. But it was the last semester, so that's O.K.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Were your colleges and universities willing to accommodate the business demands that conflicted with your classes?</p>
        <p>TSENG -- At Harvard, until last year, it was actually prohibited to start a company in your dorm room. So we had to get an off-campus mailbox and other e-mail accounts and stuff like that. My cell phone is our company phone. That rule changed last year, and now Harvard is starting to become a lot more supportive of business. But definitely, when we started, it wasn't the case.</p>
        <p>Q. -- There was literally a rule against students starting companies?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- Yeah, there was. Fifty years ago, if you were to run a business out of your room, what was it? Like, you're storing poultry? What are you putting in your room? You were actually using Harvard's resources.</p>
        <p>Now, it's not actually a strain on the college. If you type an e-mail every now and then, and that's what running a business consists of, it doesn't really affect them at all. I think they came to that realization.</p>
        <p>GUT -- B.U. has changed a lot. Had I entered school two years later, I probably wouldn't have had to take a leave. They've established something called the E-Business Hatchery -- they're choosing companies and in some form helping to incubate them, and then bringing the venture community to those student-run businesses.</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- At M.I.T. there are no rules, except that you can't have a corporate Web server running on one of their I.P. addresses. There's a statistic that BancBoston puts out, that says if you took all the companies M.I.T. graduates have started, it would create the world's 18th-largest economy over all. I think it speaks pretty well to M.I.T.'s view on new companies, and it's completely institutionalized.</p>
        <p>Q. -- When you try to raise money, do people take you less seriously because you're a student?</p>
        <p>TSENG -- At least in the venture capital world, they definitely see it as a much bigger risk, because you're not able to devote 110 percent to your company -- you know, maybe only 105 percent. So we've actually had a pretty tough time. All the money we have raised so far has been from private investors, friends and family.</p>
        <p>Now, though, we have a lot of people who are out of college, who are working full time, so it's going better, and we have some more promising leads.</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- We had no difficulty raising our Series A [first round of capital financing]. This is while we're still in college, and with no product lines yet. We're a services company with the promise of future revenue growth; that's it, the idea.</p>
        <p>I'm sure the M.I.T. name helps. And showing the V.C.'s that you know what you don't know -- that's very important. We recognize there's a lot to do, and we intend to recruit senior management and figure out a lot of different pieces to the business. V.C.'s are very receptive to that.</p>
        <p>GUT -- Somebody once put it clearly to me. I was in a meeting with a venture capital company, and they said to me, ''Are you a student or are you an entrepreneur?'' And at that moment I realized you really can't be both.</p>
        <p>That was the point when I said, ''O.K., I'm taking a year off of school.''</p>
        <p>Once I did that, things completely changed. It wasn't, ''Oh, he's 19, he's 20'' -- it was, ''How good is the business model?'' And my business model was judged just like that of somebody who is 25.</p>
        <p>Of Energy and Experience</p>
        <p>Q. -- How does your age affect the day-to-day running of your business? Does it color your interactions with older employees or potential business partners?</p>
        <p>TSENG -- All of our employees are, I think, 25 or younger. So there's really no age barrier there.</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- It's almost an advantage being young. You tend to work long hours. I work 18-  and 20-hour days. A lot of my co-founders do the same thing. From that standpoint, we're able to deliver 30 percent more per week in getting stuff done.</p>
        <p>There are experience lags, things you learn the hard way, but over all, I'd say it's a benefit. In this market, things are so operations-centric: can you deliver, what does your margin look like, etc. -- that's what is most important.</p>
        <p>GUT -- There are some people who say, ''When I was 19, I was out partying, and I wouldn't trust my money with somebody who is 19.'' But I think, by and large, those people are missing out on the new economy, and there are very few of those people left. Most people realize that a lot of the best ideas in today's economy are coming from young people.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Looking back to the beginning of your business experience, what were you naive about? What did you learn the hard way?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- Marketing is unbelievably important, and I didn't really realize that. I had a couple of great products that I thought could sell very well. But I just kind of put them there and expected: ''Everybody will find it. It's a good product. People will buy it.'' And I was just dead wrong.</p>
        <p>TSENG -- One thing I learned is that you should trust your intuition. I read a lot of magazines and trade journals, and when you are doing it for the first time, you tend to think something should be done a certain way because it's been written. It's not until you see the results that you realize: ''I was right. I should have trusted myself.''</p>
        <p>A concrete example of that is when I had to hire campus representatives at different colleges. The conventional wisdom about the Internet was, ''Speed is everything; expand as quickly as possible.'' So I hired anyone I could find, even people in high school. I hired people that I knew were unqualified just to have a presence at the school, so we'd get 30 schools instead of 10.</p>
        <p>And what ended up happening is, of course, those 20 people that were incompetent didn't deliver anything and just wasted my time. The lesson I learned is, only hire the best people, and more generally, trust your intuition.</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- Learn your tactics before you have to use them. Looking back, rather than just strategizing about how to get into the market, I wish I had spent more time figuring out how actually to do it once we got there. Because once you are in the fray, you don't have time to think and plan what's the best way to do things.</p>
        <p>GUT -- I wish I had known how important it is to write a business plan. I always felt, as with my first business, that if I do something that is successful I won't need a business plan, because it's successful and therefore everyone will be interested in it.</p>
        <p>Yet it was still very hard to create investor interest. In today's world,  you really do need a strong business plan, and I didn't do that until eight months after we were up and running.</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- When I started, I did everything, and I'm really not the best at doing everything. I had to learn that even though it's out of pocket, you're better off paying somebody to do something if they can do a better job than you can.</p>
        <p>Back to School, or Not</p>
        <p>Q. -- At this point, would you gain anything from getting an M.B.A.?</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- Absolutely not. First, M.I.T.'s undergraduate Sloan Program is basically a graduate program. But, No. 2, I have learned more in the last four and a half months than I ever would have in any institution. If I need someone to really know financial accounting extraordinarily well, I'll hire somebody from Wall Street.</p>
        <p>GUT -- I'm planning on going to business school. I think there's a lot I can learn in graduate school. I really hope that I'll have the time.</p>
        <p>TSENG -- I wouldn't go to business school for learning how to write a business plan or how to manage people. But for some reason -- I don't know if it's what you learn there or whatever else -- most of the top C.E.O.'s are M.B.A.'s. If you look at the C.E.O.'s of the top 800 companies, more than 60 of them are Harvard M.B.A.'s -- and that's just Harvard M.B.A.'s, not M.B.A.'s in general. I think that that says something.</p>
        <p>I know people who go to business school just so they won't be replaced as C.E.O. when their company gets to a certain level.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Who in the business world do you look to as a role model?</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- Craig McCaw [the cellular telephone pioneer]. He is a leader of the wireless communications paradigm. He's done a lot of behind-the-scenes work that has enabled the next major revolution.</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- I'd have to say Bill Gates. That's kind of a staple, but it's really amazed me how much Microsoft has affected everybody and everything. It's amazing to me how well it continues to do, because you can have an incredible software product but two years later you're done, you're finished. Microsoft has used the success of their past products to ensure the success of their future ones, which is something that I try to do.</p>
        <p>GUT -- I've always been able to look up to my father as a role model for the way he runs his business. Any decision I'm not 100 percent sure of, he's the first person I go to. He's extremely old-economy -- he manufactures zippers -- whereas I'm on the opposite end. But at the end of the day, strong business fundamentals cross the borders.</p>
        <p>TSENG -- I don't know if I would call this person a role model, but he's a good friend of mine and he's maybe six months older than me. He started his first company when he was 13. And every single company has been success after success. Now he's dropping out of Stanford to start what he thinks will be a billion-dollar company. He's a lot more experienced than I am, so I don't really feel all that foolish calling him a mentor. He just has such good business intuition.</p>
        <p>Q. -- What do you see as the potential for your current business, and how far out in time do you look at it? A year? Five years?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- I have a very long-term view. There are just hundreds of millions of solutions that people are looking for. If I can get everybody in this country to give me a penny, 270 million people, that's a lot of money right there. Or even a dollar.</p>
        <p>I think you can sell a product to every single computer user in this country that they would find useful. And that's where I like to orient myself. As long as people have needs to be fulfilled, I think that I'll have a company that will be very successful.</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- Lobby 7 is in a trillion-dollar space, no question. We could be the next Microsoft, as far as scale and influence in the wireless world. That is our aspiration: global domination, very quick.</p>
        <p>As far as my role within the company, right now we've already begun the C.E.O. search. We're looking for the figurehead to take the company to the next level. I'm sure I'll be part of the company for a long time; it's just a question of where.</p>
        <p>Q. -- When companies grow, founders don't necessarily continue to run the show. Is that something you're O.K. with, or do you see yourselves continuing to run your businesses as they get bigger?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- I would say that that's really the only thing I enjoy doing. It's ''Rampell Software'' because it's my company; I want to keep it that way, and I really enjoy directing things, being at the very top of things.</p>
        <p>I don't like programming. I don't like answering e-mail. I don't like  doing the marketing. I like to be able to delegate all that, and determine the overall direction of the company.</p>
        <p>TSENG -- It's possible that once our company is self-sustaining and consistently profitable, the excitement won't be as great, and I might get bored with it, quite honestly. At that point, I might move on to something else.</p>
        <p>I've heard that the first company you start is where you do your learning, and the second is where you make your money. In about 10 years, my ambition is to start the next Intel, and I wouldn't want to be replaced as C.E.O. then.</p>
        <p>GUT -- I ultimately want to do what's best for the company, best for my shares in the company.</p>
        <p>Right now I think I'm the best in charge, and that's why I'm in charge. As soon as I think that somebody else could do better, the first thing I would do is find that person and put them in charge. I'm not stuck on being in charge; I'm stuck on being successful.</p>
        <p>As the Parade Passes By</p>
        <p>Q. -- What sacrifices have you made to be students and business leaders at the same time? What have you missed out on?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- Sleeping is No. 1. Sleeping is good, but I don't always have time to do it.</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- Intellectual exploration has been limited. There's not a lot of time for reading new books or worrying about this or that new technology. So at some point in my life, I'm sure I'll probably go back to school -- but not at all for an M.B.A. -- probably architecture or something like that.</p>
        <p>GUT -- I have two roommates. Last night at about 11, they left, and came back about 3 in the morning. I was still in front of my computer. Then they went out again and came back about 4:30, and I had just turned off my computer. They had been out for six or seven hours having a good time.</p>
        <p>It's in the back of your head: I'm doing all this, I'm learning a lot and hopefully I'm making money, but, you know, 40 years from now, when I'm still probably doing the same thing, working and starting companies, will I look back and say: ''Why was I doing that when I was 21? I should have been out having a good time.''</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- You really have to think, is the idea that you have now so unique? Is it such a timely event that you can't do it at any other time? And I'm not really sure. I don't really know enough to say no, so I want to keep pursuing what I'm doing. But I think it's definitely a tradeoff.</p>
        <p>Q. -- How much are you motivated by money?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- Obviously I like money. But I kind of view it more as a yardstick for how much I've accomplished.</p>
        <p>If you work 80 hours a week, like some people in investment banking, you can make a lot of money, but you're really killing yourself. This summer I worked a lot, but I loved the fact that whenever I wanted, I could go play squash twice a day. And I didn't have to tell somebody I'm taking time off; I just did.</p>
        <p>The good thing about owning your own company is that you have a financial stake. You do things because you want to. You're not going to lie to your boss and say you're sick.</p>
        <p>Q. -- The markets look very different now than they did six or eight months ago. Has it cast any kind of pall on what you are doing?</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- For us, what's happened in the market has actually helped, because the focus is now on certain sectors that are doing very well, and we happen to be in one of those sectors.</p>
        <p>GUT -- It's been great for me, with the exception of last March, when we were very close to closing our first round of funding and the group we were working with wanted to take time and see how things were going to settle.</p>
        <p>But in the last nine months Col legeClub.com, which was big in our space, filed for bankruptcy and another competitor, The DormStore,  just shut down. I've gotten a whole bunch of people all of a sudden with a lot of expertise in what I'm doing, who need work, and who are not so expensive to hire anymore.</p>
        <p>We ended up just raising money privately again, and we're profitable. Our revenue has tripled now from what it was six months ago, and our profits are just behind that, so we're growing very fast. We're at 31 schools, and we hope to be at over 200 by next year, without raising venture capital.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Napster, a company founded by a college student, is challenging conventional conceptions of intellectual property and copyright. Does Napster's popularity have implications for you as current or future owners of intellectual property?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- I think it's going to be impossible to get rid of Napster and things like Napster.</p>
        <p>I have a problem with this every day. If everybody using my software paid for it, I'd have my own jet right now. But I clearly don't, because not everybody is that honest. And to some extent, I really don't mind.</p>
        <p>Some piracy can almost be good, because later on in life, the kid who might have pirated a program is going to need that program, and he's already been exposed to it. That's why I make all my software so you can use it before you actually have to pay for it.</p>
        <p>GUT -- A year and a half ago, very few people knew about Napster, but now everyone is using it. And that's what impresses me, that something can just so quickly be in such demand that everybody wants it and can use it. Hopefully CollegiateMall will be able to figure out how to make that happen, too.</p>
        <p>TSENG -- Napster's a good response to people who ask the question: ''Is the Net revolution over?'' This is a 19-year-old kid who is making all the big record companies shake in their boots. There's always room for innovation. That's something I'm going to believe in forever.  Not Over the Hill at 30</p>
        <p>Q. -- It is a classic interview question, but it's particularly relevant with this group: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- A lot of what I'm doing right now is based on how computers work right now. I'm not really sure what the state of computers will be in 10 years.</p>
        <p>There might be a paradigm shift. There might be new kinds of technology that completely change the way people interact. Computers may make my software obsolete.</p>
        <p>But the basic idea, the premise behind what I do, is to just make things better. I plan to continue to do that.</p>
        <p>Where I see myself going in 10 years is moving toward finding a way to sell my products as a service that you rent, or pay for every month, as opposed to buying something once and then you've got it forever.</p>
        <p>TSENG -- It's interesting that you said 10 years, because that's when I'm going to start the next Intel.</p>
        <p>Since the summer after I graduated from high school, I've been doing research in molecular electronics. What we're focusing on now is using molecules to compute. Those devices will be approximately a million times smaller than what are currently in computers.</p>
        <p>You've probably heard of Moore's Law, which is that every 18 months the number of devices on a Pentium chip doubles. But at some point silicon just won't work any more, and that point is going to come around the year 2010.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for science and I have a passion for business, and I'd love to combine both of those things and set up the next Intel.</p>
        <p>RAMBUS -- Ten years from now, either I'll be part of a new operating unit at Lobby 7, or whatever it's called by then, or I'll be starting an international real estate investment trust with some of my friends. That's  more from intellectual curiosity -- it would be fun to figure out how to do it. But 10 years to me is a long time from now.</p>
        <p>GUT -- The way CollegiateMall is going, there are three options: We get bought out, we eventually do an I.P.O., or the company stays private. In all of those instances, I really love what I'm doing and I'd love to keep doing it.</p>
        <p>But 10 years from now, I don't think that excitement, which is what I think I'm all about, will be there. I don't want to do something if my passion is not there. So I don't know where I'll be. I might be just getting out of graduate school.</p>
        <p>Q. -- What about getting a job in corporate America?</p>
        <p>TSENG -- I mentioned before that I'm driven by achievement, and I'm also driven by impact. Right now I'm only 20, and Limespot is not going to have the hugest impact in the world, but my professional ambition for life is to have big impact. Microsoft has big impact; Intel does, and presumably the next Intel would. But in a big machine where I'm steadily going up this ladder trying to express my views or make impact and not being able to -- I have no interest in that.</p>
        <p>GUT -- I think there's been a big shift.</p>
        <p>There's this service that B.U. has, where you can post your resume for companies that come on campus and recruit. I put my resume on there just because I like to see what I'm worth, for lack of a better word. [Laughter.] And it was interesting to me how a lot of these old-line companies are really trying hard to convince graduating seniors that they've changed, and that working for them is different than it used to be.</p>
        <p>So many people today don't want to work like that. To me, it's pretty neat that there are students all around the country who have products I sold them. I want to have an impact wherever I am, and I think that corporate America has that challenge when they recruit people -- to make people feel like whatever they're doing, it is going to have an impact.</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- There's so much that I can learn from a company like G.E., which does everything well, and it's huge. It makes tons of money. Even Coca-Cola, which just sells soft drinks -- they're in the business of selling, I'm in the business of selling. We're in the same business. I can learn a lot from them, and who knows, maybe they'll be able to learn something from me someday.</p>
        <p>Apart From the Crowd</p>
        <p>Q. -- What special challenges confront companies like the ones you are running?</p>
        <p>RAMPELL -- One problem that you have with the Internet is this idea of perfect competition. I think it's going to have the effect of commoditizing a lot of goods. It's very hard to distinguish yourself based on price, because if you try to do that, then the people who are buying your products are not going to have any kind of loyalty to you whatsoever. If someone else comes along with lower prices, because they have some kind of new efficiency, or they're in a foreign country with cheaper labor costs, then you're finished. You've lost your customer base. It's hard.</p>
        <p>GUT -- I don't think any company today can ever truly say, ''We really have strong barriers to entry,'' or ''We've really put out the competition.''</p>
        <p>That's been the hardest thing for me: What can I do so someone can't come in and do what I'm doing? And I think that every company in the Internet faces that difficulty. There are no barriers to entry. Anybody can get involved, so you can never rest.</p>
