        <p>PEOPLE watching ''Masterpiece Theater'' this week are in for a surprise, as the series continues its 30th season. Instead of being transported to Dickensian London, Thomas Hardy country or India at the time of the Raj, they will find themselves in a small town in Iowa during the Great Depression. This is the setting for an adaptation of Langston Hughes's short story ''Cora Unashamed,'' the first in ''American Collection,'' a series of stories by or about writers from the United States.</p>

        <p>PEOPLE watching ''Masterpiece Theater'' this week are in for a surprise, as the series continues its 30th season. Instead of being transported to Dickensian London, Thomas Hardy country or India at the time of the Raj, they will find themselves in a small town in Iowa during the Great Depression. This is the setting for an adaptation of Langston Hughes's short story ''Cora Unashamed,'' the first in ''American Collection,'' a series of stories by or about writers from the United States.</p>
        <p>To underscore the difference, there will be a new logo and new introductory music, written by John Williams and played by Yo-Yo Ma. And because it is assumed that viewers are more familiar with the American stories, Russell Baker, the host of the series, will be heard off camera only, and he will not deliver one of his literary essays, although that would have been an asset. In the case of ''Cora Unashamed,'' he could have spoken about Hughes and other African-American writers of his time and about the place of the Depression in American literature.</p>
        <p>In previous years, ''Masterpiece Theater'' has brought dramatizations of classics of English and European literature (and some lesser lights as well) into American homes. From the 12-part series ''The First Churchills,'' which began the series in January 1971, through ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' and works of George Eliot and Jane Austen, ''Masterpiece Theater'' has found a faithful ''readership.'' Occasionally, writers from the United States have been represented (James Fenimore Cooper, Henry James and Edith Wharton), but most of the American contributions to public television have been on other series, like ''American Playhouse''and ''Great Performances.''</p>
        <p>''It is high time we had some American drama on American television under 'Masterpiece Theater,' '' said Rebecca. Eaton, the executive producer. ''You don't earn a brand name overnight, and 'Masterpiece Theater' is a sturdy pair of shoulders raised above the crowded field of television.''</p>
        <p>The new series is a joint venture of Ms. Eaton at WGBH in Boston and American Literature on Television, a producing organization headed by Marian Rees. Four of the projects come from WGBH: ''The American,'' by Henry James; ''The Glass Menagerie,'' by Tennessee Williams; ''Mark and Livy'' (a biographical mini-series about Mark Twain and his wife); and open still to be determined. Ms. Rees's contributions are ''Cora''; new dramatizations of ''The Ponder Heart,'' by Eudora Welty, and ''A Death in the Family,'' by James Agee; Willa Cather's ''Song of the Lark''; and Esmeralda Santiago's ''Almost a Woman.''</p>
        <p>''Cora'' will have its premiere on Wednesday at 9 p.m. and then will be repeated on Sunday at 9 in the usual ''Masterpiece Theater'' slot. The nine films will be spaced out over the next few years and will run between regular segments of ''Masterpiece Theater.'' The idea behind the series is to film works of quality, but also to emphasize artistic, geographical and ethnic diversity. Ms. Eaton said that in choosing subjects, ''we do not want stories that have been done to death.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rees took that a bit further by announcing in Current, The Public Telecommunications Newspaper, ''We didn't want to do dead old white men; that's turgid and boring'' - thereby obliterating Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twaina nd scores of other D.O.W.M. (including Agee) who have made major literary contributions.</p>
        <p>When Ms Rees's quotation was read back to her, she said, ''I may regret that,'' and added, ''I don't mean to be irreverent.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Eaton said, ''Dead old white men stood 'Masterpiece Theater' very well.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rees admitted that she was ''in no way a student of American literature.'' She is a sociologist as well as a producer, who has often made films for the ''Hallmark Hall of Fame'' series, for which ''Cora'' might have been a comfortable fit. As expanded from a 10-page story, it concerns an incident of bigotry in an Iowa town in the 1930's. In it, Regina Taylor plays the title character, a quietly repressed but eventually rebellious servant for a white family. It is a role not unrelated to, and less evocative than, her Lilly Harper on the critically acclaimed early-1990's NBC series ''I'll Fly Away.''</p>
        <p>For ''American Collection,'' both Ms. Rees and Ms. Eaton reached out to an advisory board of teachers and literary and talent agents and also talked to writers. (It was Russell Baker who suggested to Ms. Eaton that she do ''The American.'')</p>
        <p>It is clear from three of the dramas (''Cora Unashamed,'' ''The American'' and ''The Ponder Heart'') that ''American Collection'' has made a very tentative approach to a very rich library. One problem, of course, was availablity. Ms. Eaton said that many stories they had considered were under option to other sources: ''They're not sitting on the shelf waiting for television.''</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly, questions will be raised about the choices and about the choices and about the productions themselves, which tend to stress atmosphere at the expense of narrative, despite the presence of estimable actors like Matthew Modine and Diana Rigg in ''The American'' and Peter MacNicol and JoBeth Williams in ''The Ponder Heart.''</p>
        <p>In ''Cora,'' Cherry Jones plays opposite Ms. Taylor as her small-minded employer. Ms. Taylor's character and her family are the only African-Americans in this tightly knit community. Whenever possible, the stories are filmed in locations authentic to the material. With ''Cora Unashamed,'' the director, Deborah M. Pratt, took her production to various towns in Iowa. The sweetly nostalgic look of the landscape barely conceals the underlying prejudice.</p>
        <p>After watching ''Cora Unashamed,'' viewers may have their own suggestions for future adaptations of American writers. Here are a few: Henry Adams's ''Democracy,'' Edith Wharton's ''Mother's Recompense,'' Sinclair Lewis's ''Arrowsmith,'' Theordore Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie,'' Nathanael West's ''Cool Million,'' Sarah Orne Jewett's ''Country of the Pointed Firs,'' William Faulkner's ''As I Lay Dying,'' Vladimir Nabokov's ''Pnin'' and John Cheever's ''Wapshot Chronicle.''</p>
        <p>And when will there be American writers on the ''Mystery!'' series?</p>
        <p>As the executive producer of that series as well as ''Masterpiece Theater,'' Ms. Eaton says that it is primarily a matter of money. ''Mystery!'' brings together diverse programming from British sources. She said that to have American writers on ''Mystery!'' would be ''my dream come true.''</p>
        <p>The first could be Elizabeth George. As an American who writes mysteries with very authentic English backgrounds, she would represent an ideal bridge between cultures.</p>
