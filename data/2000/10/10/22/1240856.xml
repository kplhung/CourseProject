        <p>Tucked into almost every old community in New Jersey is a cemetery that became the final resting place of the famous, the infamous and the ordinary folks who helped create the state.</p>
        <p>The Swedish and Finish immigrants who settled Swedesboro are buried in ''Old Swedes'' cemetery. Gloucester County churches are famous for their ancient cemeteries. In Newark, Evergreen Cemetery and Mount Pleasant Cemetery have a story to tell about Victorian burial customs.</p>
        <p>These and other cemeteries, historic sites and archaeological digs around the state will reveal their old stories in walking and bus tours included in ''Buried in New Jersey,'' which is being held as part of New Jersey Arts and Humanities Month today and for the next two weekends.</p>
        <p>Other events include a tour of historic Jewish cemeteries in Newark, and a discussion of the history of the funeral industry at the East Brunswick Museum. Some traditional funeral foods, like funeral biscuits and dead bone cookies, will be served during tours of three historic cemeteries in Salem.</p>
