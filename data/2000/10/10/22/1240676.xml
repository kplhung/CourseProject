        <p>We have pumpkins at morning,  and pumpkins at noon,  If it were not for pumpkins  we should be undone.</p>
        <p>Anonymous, circa 1630</p>
        <p>OUR benign neglect of the pumpkin seems to be changing. Pumpkin bread, pumpkin cheesecake and pumpkin soup have been putting in cameo appearances on restaurant menus in recent years. This fall, as part of growing creativity in American cooking, the pumpkin is playing a more prominent role than ever, with recipes available for pumpkin seed biscotti, pumpkin gnocchi, pumpkin bisque with Saga blue cheese, pumpkin hash, even almond raisin pumpkin bread.</p>
        <p>Restaurant chefs in Connecticut are no slouches in finding new ways to utilize this indigenous American crop. Brendan Walsh, the chef at the Elms Restaurant and Tavern in Ridgefield, is featuring pumpkin biscuits on his fall menu, while Tavern on Main in Westport offers tiny roasted jack-o'-lantern pumpkins as a seasonal vegetable dish, as well as pumpkin soup and pumpkin cheesecake. Kensington, the restaurant in the Norwich Inn, has pumpkin crisp on its menu, combined with apples and pears and served with pumpkin gelato.</p>
        <p>The pumpkin ricotta souffle cake served at Paci, an Italian restaurant in Southport, is light, fluffy and rich. Robert Patchen, Paci's owner and chef, also makes pumpkin risotto with shredded Parmesan cheese, sage and garlic in a pignoli sauce; and tortelli con zucca pasta (little triangles) stuffed with butternut squash, a kissing cousin of the pumpkin, and Parmesan cheese in a chopped hazelnut cream sauce.</p>
        <p>At the Mayflower Inn in Washington Depot, diners can enjoy baby pumpkins stuffed with a succotash of corn, onions, Peruvian blue potatoes and Christmas lima beans as a starter. They might then indulge in a pumpkin creme brulee (pumpkin meat roasted with chestnut honey and pureed, then prepared as a custard) accompanying venison. The inn's kitchen has also prepared toasted pumpkin seed vinaigrettes, pumpkin oils and pestos ground from the seeds and used as garnishes.</p>
        <p>By ancient accounts, pumpkins (often called pompions in Colonial cookbooks) and corn kept the early European settlers in North America alive over the long hard New England winters. The settlers, taught by American Indians how to cultivate this New World crop, baked the wholesome, thick-skinned pumpkins in the ashes, stewed them, made puddings and pies of the meat and even pickled the rind.</p>
        <p>The pumpkin was probably cultivated in prehistoric times by Indians of both North and South America. Not only was it a staple of their diet, but they also used the shells as cooking pots and serving bowls.</p>
        <p>Christopher Columbus on his first voyage wrote that in the eastern end of Cuba, he found vast fields planted with calebazzas (pumpkins and squashes). Another Spanish explorer, Cabeza de Vaca, observed pumpkins growing near Tampa Bay in Florida in 1528, and Hernando De Soto called the pumpkins of western Florida ''better and more flavorful than those of Spain,'' though he was probably confusing our pumpkins with gourds (a different species) grown in Europe. A companion of Hernando Cortes in Mexico observed squash or pumpkin seeds and flowers on the tables of Montezuma.</p>
        <p>Until the recent revived interest, pumpkins were usually relegated to being used as Halloween decorations and Thanksgiving pie. As far back as 1883, in ''Mrs. Lincoln's Boston Cook Book,'' there is not a single pumpkin recipe. Under a recipe for squash pie is the note, like an afterthought, ''Pumpkin pies are made in the same way.''</p>
        <p>The pumpkin has had a much bigger role and greater versatility in other parts of the Americas. In Brazil, home cooks make pumpkin souffles, custards and a variety of candies (often combined with coconut). Puerto Rican cookbooks have recipes for pumpkin cakes, fritters and puddings.</p>
        <p>But nowhere in the Americas is the pumpkin more a part of the cuisine than in Mexico, where virtually every bit of the vegetable is used. The seeds are featured in dips, in moles (complex spicy sauces), as snacks and ground into sauces for pork and shrimp dishes. Pumpkin blossoms are used in soups and are also stuffed, pumpkin meat is made into soups and souffles, and the rind is often candied or pickled.</p>
        <p>In ''Recipes From the Regional Cooks of Mexico,'' Diana Kennedy, longtime doyenne of Mexican cooking, uses small green pumpkins in calabaza guisada con puerco, a simple stew from Oaxaca, made with country-style spareribs in a sauce of pumpkin, tomato, fresh corn kernels, ancho chile, plantain and spices. Another of her Oaxacan specialties, legumbres en pipian Oaxaquenos (vegetables in a pumpkin seed sauce), combines unhulled pumpkin seeds with ancho and guajillo chiles, garlic and spices in a delicious vegetarian dish served with tortillas.</p>
        <p>So it's good news that we in the United States are led by innovative cooks willing to experiment, are getting more into the spirit of the great pumpkin. By using the cheery round vegetable to brighten up our fall hallways, walks and front porches, and then serving it as well, we are proving we can have our pumpkin and eat it too.</p>
