        <p>EVEN among those Americans for whom no known thermometer can detect a trace of baseball fever, and for whom the World Series is simply a reason to rediscover public broadcasting, the basic rules of the game tend to occupy some remote corner of the brain. A home run goes over the fence. A strikeout is shaming for the batter and brings good cheer to the pitcher and his supporters. Runs are scored (not points, mind you) by making trips around the bases.</p>
        <p>Of course, fans of baseball know that the game is much more complicated than that. There are balks and walks and pitching mound talks. There are pop flies, infield flies, fly balls and flyouts. There are helmets, gloves, masks, rosin bags and benches. And for each of these, a rule.</p>

        <p>Of course, fans of baseball know that the game is much more complicated than that. There are balks and walks and pitching mound talks. There are pop flies, infield flies, fly balls and flyouts. There are helmets, gloves, masks, rosin bags and benches. And for each of these, a rule.</p>
        <p>Years of nuance, fine-tuning and adaptation have been brought to bear on America's pastime since the first professional leagues were formed in 1871, and even the most exuberant followers of this season's Subway Series in New York City may be hard pressed to recite some of the minutiae collected in the 2000 edition of Major League Baseball's official rule book.</p>
        <p>How many barroom discussions hinge, for instance, on a baseball's exceeding 5.25 ounces avoirdupois? And how many lip-readers among us would be surprised to learn that no manager or player is permitted to use language which will in any manner refer to or reflect upon opposing players, an umpire or any spectator?</p>
        <p>Golly.</p>
        <p>If the rule book lives on your bedside table, read no further. Midlevel enthusiasts and baseball yearlings, however, may find the following tidbits useful for showing off at World Series parties.</p>
