        <p>I HAVE always looked at ornamental grasses a bit askance. They make me think of miscanthus, or Japanese silver grass, a prolific self-seeder that can take over a sunny bottomland in no time, which, in recent years, has been plagued by mealybugs and blight.</p>
        <p>But this fall, Rick Darke, an expert on grasses and the former curator of plants at Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., showed me a meadow behind his house in Landenberg, Pa., that opened my eyes to the beauty and versatility of native grasses. We stared at a little sea of Indian grass, Sorghastrum nutans, which spread easily from two clumps planted 10 years ago.</p>

        <p>I HAVE always looked at ornamental grasses a bit askance. They make me think of miscanthus, or Japanese silver grass, a prolific self-seeder that can take over a sunny bottomland in no time, which, in recent years, has been plagued by mealybugs and blight.</p>
        <p>But this fall, Rick Darke, an expert on grasses and the former curator of plants at Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., showed me a meadow behind his house in Landenberg, Pa., that opened my eyes to the beauty and versatility of native grasses. We stared at a little sea of Indian grass, Sorghastrum nutans, which spread easily from two clumps planted 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>''It's a native that ranges from Pennsylvania clear to the western edge of the tall-grass prairie,'' said Mr. Darke, the author of the Color Encyclopedia of Ornamental Grasses (Timber Press, 1999). The grass spreads by seeds blown by the wind in late summer, so two clumps planted right into the lawn have spread eastward, over the years, by about 50 feet.</p>
        <p>''We wanted drifts of it,'' said Mr. Darke, who gardens with his wife, Melinda Zoehrer. On the central prairie, Indian grass grows to about seven feet and its half-inch leaves are blue. In the East, its leaves are narrower, shorter and green, turning bright orange in fall. Come winter, its coppery flowers are a translucent chestnut brown.</p>
        <p>They scattered seeds of Sioux Blue, a blue six-foot Indian grass selected and named by Mr. Darke after years of evaluation at Longwood Gardens, and the Blues, a very blue selection of little bluestem, Schizachyrium scoparium. This clump-forming, fine-textured grass, which grows to about four feet, can vary from bright green to light blue with tints of purple. In fall, as Sioux Blue turns yellow, the Blues varies from tan to copper-orange to orange-red. Together, all these grasses moving with the wind under the changing sky are a little prairie in Pennsylvania. And it is maintenance-free, except for mowing in late winter or early spring.</p>
        <p>It's fascinating to watch nature take its course in a garden that embraces, rather than works against, the regional plants constantly floating in on the wind or dropped by birds or insects.</p>
        <p>The gardeners didn't use herbicide to kill the grass and other plants that were growing in this space before. They just yanked up the knapweed, an invasive thistle. And another native grass, Tridens flavus, called purpletop for its red-purple blooms, promptly seeded into the bare patches. Its open panicles, held high above the foliage and turning bronze-purple by fall and silvery-tan by winter, make great cut flowers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darke also planted a clump of big bluestem, Andropogon gerardii, which grows to six feet here. Its foliage, which ranges from green to blue-green, turns copper-red in the fall; its flowers are dark red.</p>
        <p>Another beauty in this meadow is the tall switch grass, Panicum virgatum Cloud Nine, an eight-footer whose blue-green leaves turn dark gold in the fall.</p>
        <p>''This meadow looked great in the drought last summer,'' Mr. Darke said. ''It has a huge fibrous root system.''</p>
        <p>Other wildflowers have found their way into the meadow, like the asclepias, which is notoriously hard to grow if you plant it, and the goldenrod Solidago canadensis, whose graceful nodding gold flowers are falsely blamed for hay fever (ragweed is the culprit). There are native asters everywhere, and two different silphiums, which look like nine-foot sunflowers.</p>
        <p>Between the house and the meadow, Mr. Darke has used grasses to make garden ''rooms,'' or to frame a view until newly planted trees and shrubs grow up to do the same job.</p>
        <p>He pointed out a curving grove of silverbell trees, Halesia carolina and H. diptera var. magniflora, which are a cloud of white in spring, underplanted with white-blooming fothergilla, native azaleas and sweet pepperbush. The trees and shrubs were tiny when planted 12 years ago, so he filled in the space with a sweep of feather reed grass, Calamagrostis acutiflora Karl Foerster, an upright grass with feathery white plumes in early June. Now, though the trees and shrubs have shaded out most of the grasses, a few remain on the sunny edge of the grove.</p>
        <p>And in front of a birch tree by the house, the oatlike spikelets of wild oats, Chasmanthium latifolium, turn from green to red-bronze to buff.</p>
        <p>''It makes a fabulous cut flower, and it grows well under the shade of the birch,'' Mr. Darke said. In fall, the chasmanthium turns gold as the fothergillas go red.</p>
        <p>All this show and the gardeners never water, never use chemicals.  ''We wanted a garden that wouldn't run our lives,'' Mr. Darke said.</p>
        <p>On the north side of the house, in a sunny field, they began to experiment with other native grasses. Panicum vergatum Dallas Blues, for example, is an extremely drought-tolerant new cultivar of switch grass with broad, steel-blue to gray-green leaves that can reach seven feet, and purplish flower panicles.</p>
        <p>''To most people's eye, it easily rivals miscanthus,'' Mr. Darke said.  And he predicted, ''In five years it'll be No. 1 of all the panicums.''</p>
        <p>Prairie dropseed, Sporobolus heterolepis, is an elegant mounding three-footer with a cilantro-like fragrance that turns as orange as a pumpkin in fall. And then there's Dewey Blue, a very blue, very upright form of Panicum amarum, or sand switch grass, collected and named by Mr. Darke himself, on the sandy coast of Dewey, Del. (These new grasses, discovered too late to be included in Mr. Darke's encyclopedia, may be seen on a compact disc just produced by Timber Press.)</p>
        <p>''The whole idea is to reduce maintenance, chemicals, and increase regional beauty,'' Mr. Darke said. It's not just an idea, it's a prairie.</p>
