        <p>Dick Cheney has not kissed Oprah, chatted up Regis or schmoozed with Rosie O'Donnell.

Bush's most vital voting blocs: men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney goes to football games. A lot. He talks on the stump about serious things like military procurement, and when he does engage in frivolous small talk, it is usually about his hobby, fly-fishing. Photo opportunities are staged in factories filled with heavy machinery. At a rally this morning in Plymouth, Mich., he posed for a picture with a group of men in leather motorcycle jackets and chaps, who brought signs reading ''Bikers for Bush-Cheney.''

        <p>Dick Cheney has not kissed Oprah, chatted up Regis or schmoozed with Rosie O'Donnell. In the great tradition of vice-presidential candidates, who have long been used to rally their party's political bases, Mr. Cheney seems to be shoring up the support of one of Gov. George W. Bush's most vital voting blocs: men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney goes to football games. A lot. He talks on the stump about serious things like military procurement, and when he does engage in frivolous small talk, it is usually about his hobby, fly-fishing. Photo opportunities are staged in factories filled with heavy machinery. At a rally this morning in Plymouth, Mich., he posed for a picture with a group of men in leather motorcycle jackets and chaps, who brought signs reading ''Bikers for Bush-Cheney.'' This is a macho campaign.</p>
        <p>This weekend he stumped at two football games. Mr. Cheney was the captain of his high school team (his wife, Lynne, likes to tell people that ''friends say he was slow, but when he tackled you, you knew you'd been tackled''), and on Friday night he went to his second high school football game of the month. His coin toss, which began the game between the Grand Blanc Bobcats and the visiting Flushing Raiders, was the only thing the home team won.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney likes college football, too. He tailgated at the Iowa State-Nebraska game a few weeks ago, eating a beef burger and chatting gamely with quite a few inebriated fans. And today, the candidate stopped here for the game between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. He joined tailgaters in the parking lot, putting his foot up on a beer keg and eating a bratwurst with mustard. Supporters chanted ''Football fans for Bush'' and ''Tailgaters for Cheney.''</p>
        <p>That was after he took a brief bus tour through the state with another alpha male: John McCain, the Arizona senator and Vietnam war hero.  ''I know of no man who knows the military better, who understands the needs, who has a better strategic grasp of our national security challenges then Dick Cheney, my friends,'' said Mr. McCain, the erstwhile foe of Mr. Bush but now a supporter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, meanwhile, has opened an unusual new line of attack on Vice President Al Gore in recent days: Operation Goldilocks.</p>
        <p>''I loved his description of his debate performances,'' Mr. Cheney said today. ''He said, 'First I was a little too hot, then I was a little too cold, and then I was juuust right.' He compared himself to Goldilocks! He's said that, in effect, the debates were a job interview with the American people. Well, if you were sitting in your office, and somebody came in looking for a job and described himself as Goldilocks, would you hire him?''</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Cheney's campaign stops would seemingly do little to close the gender gap, in which men are for Mr. Bush and women for Mr. Gore. While Mr. Cheney did take a break earlier this month to pick up one of his granddaughters from soccer practice, he has not gone out of his way to make a pitch to the soccer-mom crowd. On the trail, his wife often plays that role, telling audiences that the women in his life are grateful that he views cooking as ''an honorable male occupation.''</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Cheney visits a large number of schools, community colleges and senior centers, he has recently become a fixture at factories. This week he went to a plant in West Virginia that makes giant rolls of aluminum; he has also visited factories that make paint cans, widgets and doodads for the military, night-vision goggles, airplane parts, and campers and recreational vehicles.</p>
        <p>His receptions in schools have not always been as warm as his those in factories. At a stop at Rio Rancho High School in New Mexico earlier this month, a woman pointedly asked him why, as Wyoming's lone congressman, he had repeatedly voted against money for Head Start program in the 1980's. ''The cold war was raging,'' he explained. ''We were faced with the specter, the possibility, of all-out global conflict with the Soviets that could begin with little warning, and my top priority was a strong national defense.''</p>
        <p>When he can, Mr. Cheney likes to dovetail the need his campaign has for photo opportunities with what his  friends describe as his passion, or even near-mania: fly-fishing. Mr. Cheney, whose Secret Service code name is Angler, stopped at a fishing store in Oregon last month to buy a waterproof jacket and practice a few casts for the cameras. On Friday morning he stopped at an outdoorsman's shop near Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>With his entourage, the Secret Service and photographers in tow, he made a beeline for the fly-fishing section. When he emerged from the store, he had bought some stuffed animals for his three granddaughters and a fishing net for himself.</p>
