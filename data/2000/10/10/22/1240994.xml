        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Quest to Reinvent John Jay'' (Sept. 24): District 15's plan to improve John Jay High School to attract Park Slope students is admirable. But let's face it: if successful, it would not be because of its highfalutin educational programs, but rather because troublemaking, academically deficient students from far-off neighborhoods would be redirected to other schools.</p>
        <p>John Jay's problems have simply been a result of too many of these students, which no high school could be expected to turn into well-behaved high achievers. The proposal for John Jay seeks to replace these difficult teenagers with a lower number of Park Slope high schoolers and District 15 middle schoolers.</p>

        <p>I applaud the John Jay plan because it might save local students from having to schlep to far-off high schools, as I did in the 1980's despite  living just two blocks from John Jay. However, I regard the plan as simple redistricting wrapped in a fancy package.</p>
