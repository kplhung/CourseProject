      <block class="full_text">
        <p>It was almost imperceptible. But I suppose from having appeared on television hundreds of times, he knew the camera was not on him.</p>
        <p>Still . . .</p>
        <p>Bob Franks's lips were moving as Jon Corzine delivered his opening remarks at the second debate between the two Senate candidates. I couldn't help but notice, I was on the panel of questioners.</p>
        <p>Was Mr. Franks memorizing his own opening statement or was he a ventriloquist? And did he have his hand up Mr. Corzine's back?</p>
        <p>For an editor who is used to posing his questions to reporters at the other end of a telephone line, this was an enlightening experience that was unfolding before me in the studios of NJN .</p>
        <p>As it happened, I didn't get to ask many of the questions I really wanted to. For one thing, there was a pretty rigid format in the Oct. 12 debate -- religiously adhered to by the moderator -- so that follow-up questions were allowed, but only after one candidate answered a query, the other answered the same question and the first candidate then offered a rebuttal. By the time the chance for the follow-up came around, who could remember the original question? Who was even living in the same state by then?</p>
        <p>So let me ask my questions now, candidates. You've been patient.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, are you refusing to release your tax returns because they might shine a harsh light on some of Goldman Sachs's holdings, thereby endangering the financial security of Western Europe or several third world countries that are about to search for oil? And if so, which ones?</p>
        <p>And how do you feel about Al Gore and Joe Lieberman imploring Hollywood to limit the sex and violence in movies, video games, the Internet and television? Or will that reveal just what percentage of Hollywood Goldman Sachs actually owns?</p>
        <p>One more question, Mr. Corzine. In several instances, the facts have been as elusive as, well, as a Jon Corzine tax return. For instance, when the head of a black minister's organization and 19 other members endorsed your candidacy last April, you stood by silently when a reporter asked if you had made any donations and one minister angrily dismissed the question. After being pressured to disclose your charitable donations, it was revealed that your family foundation had given $25,000 to a church in East Orange. Then you said you made the donation before you become a candidate. Actually, you pledged the money in July after forming an exploratory committee and made the donation three months after declaring your candidacy.</p>
        <p>Then there was the incident in which you insisted Mr. Franks was wrong when he said you had not voted in several recent elections when open-space bond issues were on the ballot. Your emphatic denial sent reporters scurrying to the Union County Board of Elections, where records showed that, yep, you guessed, you were absent that day.</p>
        <p>''Jon misspoke,'' was your spokesman's terse euphemism.</p>
        <p>So the question is simply this: Why should the voters trust you with the big things when they can't trust you with the little ones?</p>
        <p>I would like to ask Mr. Franks some questions too, but I see that his lips are still moving.</p>
        <p>O.K. Mr. Franks, every public opinion poll shows that you are trailing Mr. Corzine, who has spent about $53 million so that voters will recognize his name on the ballot, by at least 12 percent. Grudgingly, Republicans in Washington have agreed to toss $300,000 to $400,000 your way -- the equivalent of offering you a Lucky Strike before the firing squad arrives in the battleship New Jersey. Talk about numbers not adding up.</p>
        <p>So explain something: Why should the voters of New Jersey give you a vote of confidence on Election Day when your own party would rather invest its money in someone else?</p>
        <p>You're a lawyer. Why don't you just hang a shingle today in Berkeley Heights? You must have lots of I.O.U.'s out there. Soon you'll be able to afford one of those sculptured suits like the friend of the working man to your Left.</p>
        <p>Speaking of big spenders, Mr. Corzine, you propose spending billions on health care for the uninsured, long-term care for the elderly and disabled, education, a prescription drug benefit under Medicare and other programs. Judging by this liberal agenda, you make Senator Paul Wellstone look like Charlton Heston.</p>
        <p>In case you haven't noticed, President Clinton and that person from Tennessee whom he put in the vice president's office eight years ago have not so gently nudged the Democratic Party into the center of the political spectrum. And they don't control either house of Congress. Whether the Democrats will regain any of that clout in a few weeks is still a three-point tossup.</p>
        <p>So what do you really want to do when you get to Washington next January? And by the way, in answering one of the questions, sir, you spoke up loudly for the passage of hate-crime legislation. Before you roll out your agenda, you had better look across the aisle at some of your esteemed colleagues.</p>
        <p>I see my time for questioning is up, gentlemen. I'll meet you at the Summit Diner. Jon, you pay the tab. Bob, please check his math.</p>
