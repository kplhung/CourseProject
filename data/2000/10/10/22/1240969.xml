        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was appalled at the greed and gall displayed by the brides in your story on ''sponsored weddings'' (''Here Comes the Bride, and Her Sponsors,'' Sept. 24). Our materialistic society seems to have hit a new low when people who feel pressured to have an elaborate wedding expect others to pay for it.</p>
        <p>A woman is quoted as saying, ''If anything is immoral, it's spending $30,000 on a wedding and putting themselves into debt.'' Does it occur to this young woman that if you can't afford a $30,000 wedding, you shouldn't have one?</p>

        <p>A wedding should be about celebrating the love between two people, not showing off to your acquaintances about who can have the fanciest reception.</p>
        <p>If I ever receive an invitation sporting a corporate logo, you can be sure my R.S.V.P. will read ''will not attend.''</p>
