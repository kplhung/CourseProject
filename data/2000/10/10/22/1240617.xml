        <p>Such is Amram Ducovny's skill as a writer that in his new novel, CONEY (Overlook, $26.95), he is able to transport readers swiftly into the garish and seamy heart of Coney Island on the eve of World War II; it's as if the lights of Dreamland and Luna Park were still brightly lit. This richly drawn portrait of 15-year-old Harry Catzker, the son of a writer whose stories are serialized in a Yiddish daily newspaper and a beautiful but alienated mother, offers a welcome twist on the coming-of-age novel. ''Coney'' is also a noirish thriller and a darkly comic and moving glimpse into the lives of Jewish immigrants in the 1930's. The story begins as Harry is offered an after-school job picking up betting slips from Coney Island's carnival freaks for the local bookie. The rude, oversexed, often hilarious fat ladies and dwarfs, not to mention his new gangster friends, offer Harry a welcome respite from the combative and pessimistic mood of his family. Take his grandmother, whom he calls Bama, for instance. After arriving in the United States in 1919, she immediately ''sniffed a mean, godless country. . . . She learned no English, guarding her illiteracy like a jewel. When Harry asked her why she did not speak English, she summoned a tone of irrefutable logic. 'For what do I need English? Did they speak English in Warsaw?' ''But Ducovny -- who, as it happens, is the father of the actor David Duchovny -- never resorts to Jewish stereotypes. Harry and his complicated, unpredictable family, as well as the Yiddish poet who boards with them, are struggling with more than just being strangers in a strange land. The grim shadow of the impending Holocaust abroad presages, it turns out, a smaller-scale disaster closer to home. The story of how Harry and his friends and relatives survive, thrive and flame out is as satisfying and exhilarating as a ride on the Cyclone.</p>
