        <p>IN this season of political spinmeisters, what could be more appropriate than artwork that celebrates spin?</p>
        <p>''Spin Art 2000,'' by Stephen Hooper of Clifton, is a gentle joke that does not take a political stand. It showcases things that spin -- especially CD's -- and the mechanisms that convey spinning of the political variety.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hooper, who goes by the name Hoop, is an artist who uses cars as canvas, making what he considers a public art form. He refuses to give his age, but when a garbage collector who stopped to gawk at his works guessed 45, he allowed that it was not a bad estimate. He has created dozens of car-based artworks over the last 15 years, sometimes putting the same vehicle through several incarnations.</p>
        <p>The consistent threads in his works are imagination, recyclable materials and contact cement. Beyond that, every creation is one of a kind, and usually relates to more traditional artwork he is doing at the time.</p>
        <p>''Spin Art'' is also the name he uses for a series of framed quotations about himself from articles or news broadcasts. The works are long rectangles with cleanly printed words on them, like street signs.</p>
        <p>''It's basically self-promotion,'' he acknowledged.</p>
        <p>His other recent works include a vehicle he calls the Good-Luck Truck, actually built around a Vespa, a three-wheeled motorcycle from Italy. ''I scavenged for good luck symbols,'' he said. ''Things pertaining to good luck and the ways people wish for luck.'' Its Day-Glo colors and carnival-style wheel of fortune, which people can spin, make it a popular street attraction.</p>
        <p>''It's fun to have a little bit of artwork out on the street,'' Mr. Hooper said. The art-viewing audience in museums or galleries is self-limiting, but street art can reach anyone, he noted. ''I'd rather have it on the street where I come around the corner and it's a surprise,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He is always remaking the cars, so he's not concerned about damage. Once another driver smashed into the fender of one of his vehicles. ''I went home, pounded it out and put more material on it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A tan Dodge van was the raw material for his spin art work. Playing off the media spin idea, it uses various communication devices, including the horn from an old cylinder phonograph, an early cartridge player from the 1960's called a Playtape, eight-track and reel-to-reel tape players and tubes from radios and telephones from each of the last several decades, many of them painted silver.</p>
        <p>''It's what I call techno-trash,'' Mr. Hooper said. It represents ''all the transitions we've gone through over the years, from a needle on a record to a laser beam on a record,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The dominating effect of the van is the shimmer of hundreds of rainbows glinting off the CD's that cover its sides. ''At night the prism effect is great under the street lights,'' Mr. Hooper said. ''Going through the Lincoln Tunnel, these things look like they're spinning.''</p>
        <p>He obtained many of the CD's as a contest prize from a radio station in Alaska. His entry was an artwork using old records, and the prize was supposed to be $500 worth of CD's. ''They never sent me anything, so I called and said: 'Send me anything. I'm just going to glue them on my car.' '' Most of the CD's he received were European newscasts meant to be played by radio stations. Many of the rest were America Online giveaways he collected at a computer show at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.</p>
        <p>Filling out the work are old records like Bing Crosby's ''Sweet Leilani.'' The van's wheels even resemble records, with mock needles endlessly spinning along with them.</p>
        <p>Although he used to work in studios in Manhattan, on 14th Street and Prince Street, Mr. Hooper returned a few years ago to the Clifton house he grew up in when his mother had a stroke and needed care.</p>
        <p>His vehicles, unusual in any setting, seem all the more surprising on his prototypical suburban New Jersey street. It's all split-levels and siding, Tauruses and Escorts, and the end of the street unravels into dead ends and cul-de-sacs.</p>
        <p>It's the kind of block where a flock of shiny, furry and colorful vehicles stands out, but Mr. Hooper says he doesn't get complaints from the neighbors.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't bother me,'' said Patrick McCormack, 67, who lives across the street. Trimming the tidy lawn at the edge of the petunia beds in front of his split-level house, Mr. McCormack added: ''I go over and see what his new creations are. It's definitely a car-stopper.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes Mr. Hooper leaves one of his vehicles parked in SoHo over a weekend, so people can study the details. When he parks his Good-Luck Truck, he leaves a little notebook for feedback. Among the recent comments scribbled in its pages, someone wrote: ''I want my girlfriend to love and marry me. Pray for me please.'' Another message read, ''May you receive as much happiness as you give.''</p>
