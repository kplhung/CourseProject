        <p>WHEN you've got it, flaunt it.</p>
        <p>In a study to be released at the end of October, the National Association of Home Builders has found that the average American house just keeps getting bigger. In 1999, the average size of new home was 2,225 square feet. By June 2000, it had hit 2,260 square feet.</p>
        <p>That means the average new American spread is 50 percent larger than it was in 1970.</p>

        <p>WHEN you've got it, flaunt it.</p>
        <p>In a study to be released at the end of October, the National Association of Home Builders has found that the average American house just keeps getting bigger. In 1999, the average size of new home was 2,225 square feet. By June 2000, it had hit 2,260 square feet.</p>
        <p>That means the average new American spread is 50 percent larger than it was in 1970.</p>
        <p>''And the amazing thing is that during the same period, family size has declined by at least 20 percent,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, the group's research director.</p>
        <p>Americans not only want more floor space: they want higher ceilings -- nine foot instead of eight. And they want more windows, more light, more glass. And nobody but nobody, Mr. Ahluwalia added, wants to face a wall. Instead, they want to see through one room to another, through that room to the garden and from there out to the trees and the mountains beyond.</p>
        <p>''They not only want more space, they want it to appear even bigger than it is!'' he said.</p>
        <p>Living rooms are vanishing, and forget the dining room: half of Americans homeowners eat in a (vast) kitchen, devouring a meal cooked on a center island, with vegetables washed in a double sink. There's more hardwood, more Corian, more marble. At least one fireplace is de rigueur -- even if you live in Southern California. And Americans are looking for three-car garages, not so much for cars as to park their junk; many use all three bays for storage and relegate the machine to the asphalt.</p>
        <p>This striving for luxury -- in both size and details -- is not new. In fact, it's so American it precedes America. When the first countrymen were building their tepees, they, too, were into size and ornament. They built the conical shelters with the chief ensconced in the biggest, most luxurious dwelling. But below him there was no hierarchy, said Laila Williamson, an anthropologist with the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>''They were egalitarian,'' she said, 'but some people did have more: men who were lucky at hunting or women who were more industrious and made nicer tepee covers.''</p>
        <p>The best tepees had linings of buffalo skin stretching two-thirds of the way up, decorated with paintings of animals and geometric figures. The average tepee might have been 12 feet across, with the doorway facing east and a smoke hole at the top. Honored guests would be seated against the back wall; the hosts' best possessions were hung around the wall on pegs.</p>
        <p>''There was quite a bit of stuff,'' Ms. Williamson said.</p>
        <p>THE early colonists didn't have much money, leisure time or, probably, a lot of guests. But households were large. In parts of Pennsylvania, for example, an average of seven people crowded into a 16-foot by 20-foot space, said Sally McMurry, a social historian and author of ''Families and Farmhouses'' (Oxford University Press, 1988). This crowd might have included grandparents and aunts and uncles, as well as apprentices. Some log cabins came with servants.</p>
        <p>The interior spaces were designed to bring people together -- people gathered around the hearth and the candle. But even then, there were status symbols.</p>
        <p>''The bed was typically one of the best pieces of furniture,'' Ms. McMurry said, ''so the best bed would be in the best room on the ground floor. Maybe they'd even entertain guests in that room.'' If somebody had to sleep alone, they would write about it in their journal: how lonely they were.</p>
        <p>''We look back and say how horrible it was that they didn't have any privacy,'' said Ms. McMurry, ''but I've seen accounts of when they were left alone, they felt disconnected from who they were, how they saw themselves.''</p>
        <p>After the Revolution, as the nation prospered, family members began separating themselves from each other, and from their guests.</p>
        <p>In the early 19th century, the well-to-do began building grand brick center-hall Georgian mansions. Even the average house was built with a center hallway, where visitors could cool their heels waiting for entree to one of the front parlors. Presumably, if you were a person of lesser status or charm, you might be left to wait there for some time.</p>
        <p>At the turn of the century, while the Astors and Vanderbilts were building their cavernous ''cottages'' in Newport, R.I., the average Americans were trying to pull their families together again, said Elisabeth Garrett, who wrote ''At Home: The American Family 1750 to 1870.'' (Abrams, 1998) They were looking toward a domestic ideal -- sometimes called the Arts and Crafts Revival -- and copying Cotswold bungalows, building inglenooks and layering them with handmade tiles.</p>
        <p>But domestic intimacy never gained much of a foothold, and after the Second World War, many Americans reacted to their prosperity by really spreading out, in ranch houses where the children often had a bedroom wing, as far away as possible from their parents.</p>
        <p>Today, the two-story home is back, statistics show, and it's the parents who luxuriate in their own private spas -- in their private Master Bathroom Wings -- and look out their many windows.</p>
        <p>''We all want to be J. P. Morgan,'' said Witold Rybczynski, the social historian and author. ''It really hasn't changed much, except in the 19th century there were a few hundred people that were wealthy and now there are thousands and thousands. We have the same desires as our grandparents, for space, for 20-, 30-, 40-foot ceilings.''</p>
        <p>America is often said to be a Puritan culture, uncomfortable with its material excesses. Perhaps, but America seems also to have inherited from ancestors across the sea an abiding desire for luxury and display. It's the voice that whispers ''Chateau,'' ''Palazzo,'' ''Stately Home.''</p>
