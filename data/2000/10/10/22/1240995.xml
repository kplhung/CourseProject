        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>John Jay is a prominent neighbor; like the 500-pound gorilla, it can't be ignored. In all the time we have lived in Park Slope, I cannot recall being invited to any function at John Jay, nor do I recall any instance where John Jay has reached out to the community at large. The only times I've been inside the building have been to vote.</p>
        <p>I can only judge John Jay High School by its outward appearance, and I would have to say that John Jay is a bad neighbor. Mountains of litter and trash are continually on display on Fourth Street, just off Seventh Avenue. The trash seems to be flung out without regard to where or how it lands. The plastic bags are torn and their contents spill out and swirl through the street. In a word it is disgusting.</p>

        <p>I think that Mark G. Peters and others who hope to better integrate John Jay into the immediate neighborhood need to realize the importance of propriety and appearance. If the best John Jay can do is to fling their garbage into the street, they have a long way to go.</p>
