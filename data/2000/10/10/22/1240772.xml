        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am grateful to Peter Farley for protesting the infuriating, inappropriate laughter during the performance of ''Richard II'' that he attended at BAM. It was especially horrible when incessant gigglers were in nearby seats. Along with Mr. Farley, I cringe at the memory of the brainless snickering that one knew would greet ''poisoned by their wives'' during a profoundly sad speech. It seemed that many Americans understood Shakespeare's words without understanding his meaning.</p>

        <p>Perhaps they wanted to make sure that everyone knew that they ''got'' Shakespeare's clever words, whereas British audiences assume that everyone understands Shakespeare and don't feel a need to annoy everyone by showing off their understanding.</p>
