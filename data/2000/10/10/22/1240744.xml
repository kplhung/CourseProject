        <p>DAMS have held back the waters of the Yantic River of Norwich for more than 300 years. But they may soon disappear as part of a nationwide effort to restore rivers' natural flow and ecology, to solve chronic flooding problems, and to alleviate the risk of failure of old dams that no longer serve a purpose.</p>
        <p>Norwich's public works director, Joseph N. Loyacano, said he hoped to use a $300,000 civil preparedness grant aimed at easing chronic flooding to dismantle two dams above the Yantic River's waterfall.</p>
        <p>''People now realize it's not a crazy idea to breach and dismantle dams that no longer serve any practical purpose,'' Mr. Loyacano said. ''People understand the environmental damage and public safety problems posed by old dams that have outlived their usefulness.''</p>
        <p>As early as the 17th century, Norwich's impounded waters fueled some of the first industrialism in New England, powering grist mills, textile mills and more. But during the great hurricane of 1938 a dam on the Shetucket River failed, adding millions of dollars to the storm's damage. In 1963 six people died and more than $6 million in property damage resulted after the earthen dam on Spaulding Pond collapsed, sending a wall of water and debris through downtown Norwich. During the winter of 1991-92, ice floes in the Yantic River upstream from the two dams threatened the Sherman Street Bridge.</p>
        <p>''Currently municipalities are required to maintain and repair dams even if they no longer serve any purpose, even if they're causing flooding problems,'' said Mr. Loyacano. ''Nature never stops undermining and working towards the destruction of a dam.</p>
        <p>''Given enough time a river will undermine and break every dam in its way,'' Mr. Loyacano said as he pointed out the cracks between the granite blocks of the Yantic River's upper dam. ''Sooner or later these dams are coming down. You could wait for something like a hurricane and the destructive catastrophic failure of a dam. Or you can, in an orderly, intelligent nondestructive way, dismantle these dams and reap the environmental, flood-control and public safety benefits,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Loyacano has rewritten the Yantic River flood abatement plan to allow for the dismantling of the dams. The city council is expected to vote on the new plan later this month.</p>
        <p>''Getting the necessary state and federal permits to take down the dams on the Yantic River could be a prolonged and onerous process,'' said Wesley Marsh, a supervisory environmental analyst for the State Department of Environmental Protection's dam safety division. ''Many things must be considered before permits can be issued. A large consideration is the sediment behind the dams. Do these sediments contain toxic materials? What will happen to these sediments if the dam is removed?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Loyacano said the dismantlement of the dams would begin by removing the granite blocks that comprise the top tier of the upper dam with a crane.</p>
        <p>''The sediments for the most part will remain in place,'' he said. ''After a year or two, after the river's flow and ecology have adjusted to the change in the dam, the next tier of granite blocks will be removed, and so on.'' .</p>
        <p>Richard Jacobson, assistant director of the fisheries division of the D.E.P., said the permit process is difficult, but not impossible.</p>
        <p>''You have to address many issues,'' he said. ''There's the issue of the quality of the sediments. There's the social implications of removing the dam.</p>
        <p>''There's the public safety issues, there's the flood control issues,'' he  said.</p>
        <p>According to archaeological evidence, the area by the falls is the longest continuously inhabited area of Norwich. ''The abundance of fish would account for this,'' Mr. Jacobson said.</p>
        <p>''But there is no clear historical evidence that fish such as Atlantic salmon or shad were able to surmount the natural barrier posed by the falls.'' he said. ''Nevertheless, the dams harmed native species such as brook trout, dace and sturgeon. These fish require different river habitats for spawning, for their juvenile development and their maturity. Because of the dams the fish were barred from these different riverine habitats.''</p>
        <p>He said if the dams were removed, conditions would be favorable to these fish.</p>
        <p>It is possible to dismantle dams in Connecticut, he said, as evidenced by the impending removal of four dams on the Naugatuck River, two dams on the Mad River and one dam on the Pequabuck River primarily because of the potential improvements for fish habitat.</p>
        <p>Some groups are fighting to keep the dams. Historic preservationists argue that the structures should stand as a testament to the region's industrial history and to maintain the scenic falls.</p>
        <p>''I'm against the removal of the dams and I believe state historical preservation law prohibits the removal of the dams,'' said Norwich's historian, Dale Plummer. ''If the upper dam is removed and lowers the river by four feet, which is being proposed, there will be a less impressive flow of water over the falls.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Loyacano thinks removing the dam would increase the beauty of the area.</p>
        <p>Downstream from the falls is an important historic and scenic site known as ''Indian Leap,'' where the Mohegans and Narragansetts met in the last battle solely between Native American nations in 1644. There, Chief Miantonomo and up to 500 Narragansetts faced Sachem Uncas and as few as 150 Mohegans. Before the battle, which took place where Norwich Technical School stands, Uncas proposed that he and Miantonomo fight, one on one. But Miantonomo reportedly said, ''My men came to fight, and fight they will.''</p>
        <p>Uncas fell to the ground to signal his archers to bombard the Narragansetts. The besieged group turned to run back to their territory, when, according to historian Francis Manwaring Caulkins in 1866, they ''suddenly reached the high precipice that overhangs the cataract (the falls of the Yantic River) and plunged'' into the abyss beneath.</p>
        <p>''If the dams were dismantled people would be able to see the falls as it was in the 17th century,'' Mr. Loyacano said. ''This would be a much more scenic place.''</p>
