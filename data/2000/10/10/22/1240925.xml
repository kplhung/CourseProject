        <p>PAYING off the national debt has been elevated to an obsession. Politics does that. Vice President Al Gore, in the presidential debate last Tuesday, solemnly promised millions of Americans that he would ''eliminate the debt in the next decade.'' So would Gov. George W. Bush. And in their unanimity, they deprive the country of a necessary debate on a crucial question: Is zero national debt healthy for the economy?</p>
        <p>There is a strong case to be made that it is not. But rather than conduct a healthy and heated discussion of alternative uses for the growing budget surplus, the candidates close off discussion. In their hands, paying off the $3.5 trillion in public debt becomes almost a moral imperative, beyond politics. But economics often involves political choices.</p>
        <p>The real issue is this: How can we invest the growing budget surplus for maximum return? Put that way, paying off the debt, or some of it, is one option. So is investing in Head Start, or child care or education or the military or an air transportation system that doesn't waste millions of hours in delays.</p>
        <p>''Some debt reduction is a good idea,'' said Robert M. Solow, the Nobel laureate in economic science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''But the next question is, how much? Here's the next dollar of surplus; what do I want to do with that to earn the best return?''</p>
        <p>Think of a homeowner with $50,000 in savings, or surplus, and a $50,000 mortgage that costs $400 a month. Why pay off the mortgage, if he can invest his savings in a security that earns $450 a month? That's enough to cover the mortgage payment and $50 a month in job training to improve his earning power and, in time, his savings or surplus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, in fact, stump for such alternatives. They would devote big chunks of the projected $4.6 trillion in surpluses over 10 years to spending programs and tax cuts. But in their reverence for paying off the debt, they never ask whether it makes sense, given the high potential return from alternatives.</p>
        <p>Prominent on the list are expanding Head Start for preschool children and sending more young people to college on subsidized scholarships. Millions of working parents cannot afford good child care, so federal subsidies here would also pay off handsomely, raising well-being and efficiency in the workplace. There are so many high-yield opportunities, in fact, that maybe consideration should be given to increasing the debt a bit, rather than paying it down.</p>
        <p>That politically sensitive option should be on the table in this campaign. After all, the national debt has fallen from more than 50 percent of the gross domestic product in the early 1990's to about 35 percent today, which is like saying that our homeowner's $400-a-month mortgage claims a smaller percentage of his income as he gradually pays it off and his salary rises. He can now borrow more, perhaps to buy an apartment and rent it out at a profit. Debt in America, properly invested, is a tool of enterprise.</p>
        <p>ECONOMISTS, of course, know all this, and talk about the options among themselves. Sometimes they review for the public the pros and cons of paying off the national debt, as Mr. Solow did this month in The New York Review of Books.</p>
        <p>Like many economists, both liberals and conservatives, he argued that zero national debt is unhealthy. The debt takes the form of risk-free Treasury securities that have an important place in the world. Many investors seek them out in hard or uncertain times, and the Federal Reserve makes use of them to help regulate credit.</p>
        <p>Interest rates are the main reason offered for paying down the national debt. In theory, rates will fall as savings are shifted from the public to the private sector, encouraging  companies to borrow and invest in more productive modern facilities. That can happen when times are good and confidence is high, as they are now. But in harder, more pessimistic times, investment falls even when rates are low. Given the uncertainties, investing the surplus in education, child care or air transportation may very well produce a higher return than retiring Treasury securities.</p>
        <p>Still, there is a case to be made for paying down some debt in good times, to leave  more room to borrow when the baby boom generation retires and pension payments soar. Mr. Solow and the economist Paul Samuelson, also an M.I.T. Nobel laureate, even suggest cautiously investing a small portion of the surplus in stocks to help pay those future Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>The options abound and the debate could be exciting, if only the candidates would stop proclaiming their determination to pay off the national debt, and let the debate happen.</p>
