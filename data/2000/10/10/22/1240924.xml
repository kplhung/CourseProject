        <p>Two lots on East 54th Street that have been vacant for over four years have become the subject of recent complaints from neighbors, who say they attract trash and are a breeding ground for mosquitoes, perhaps those carrying the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>''Every time I walk by, there's garbage there, discarded clothing, human feces,'' said Harold Levine, a marketing consultant who lives on East 55th Street. ''I figured, as most New Yorkers do, that a building goes down and a building will go up.''</p>

        <p>Two lots on East 54th Street that have been vacant for over four years have become the subject of recent complaints from neighbors, who say they attract trash and are a breeding ground for mosquitoes, perhaps those carrying the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>''Every time I walk by, there's garbage there, discarded clothing, human feces,'' said Harold Levine, a marketing consultant who lives on East 55th Street. ''I figured, as most New Yorkers do, that a building goes down and a building will go up.''</p>
        <p>Development on the lots, at 349 and 351 East 54th Street, has been stymied by a tangle of lawsuits involving the town houses that once stood there. The problems began on March 18, 1996, when construction work was being done at 351, where a seven-story apartment house was to be built. During the work, a wall shared with No. 349 collapsed, forcing the emergency evacuation of that building. The city deemed the building unsafe, and the entire structure was knocked down.</p>
        <p>The owner of No. 351, as well as the construction company and various subcontractors involved in the work, were later sued by the owner and tenants of No. 349. Countersuits followed. All the litigation was consolidated, and a trial is scheduled for January.</p>
        <p>But while the legal maneuvering goes on, neighbors are focused on  another issue: what will happen with the empty space? Though both the new owner of No. 351 -- 351 East 54 L.L.C. -- which purchased the property less than a year ago, and Yasuyo Lawrence, who owns No. 349, say they plan to rebuild, neighbors are impatient.</p>
        <p>''A lawsuit takes time,'' said Mary Clare Bergin, president of the Sutton Area Community organization. ''It's not like we can all go over there with placards and say, do something.''</p>
        <p>A major source of worry is a large pit where No. 351 once stood. In recent months it has filled with stagnant water, a prime breeding ground for mosquitoes. Because of community concern that mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus might be breeding there, Councilman A. Gifford Miller complained to the Department of Health, which in August sprayed the lot with pesticide.</p>
        <p>Others are concerned about homeless people who sleep in front of the space. But for many residents, the main issue is the sheer unsightliness.</p>
        <p>''Every time I walk by it, I say, 'I can't believe there's this ugly empty dangerous lot in this neighborhood,' '' Mr. Levine said.</p>
