        <p>ACTS OF GOD</p>
        <p>By Mary Morris.</p>
        <p>244 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Picador USA. $23.</p>
        <p>I HAVE to admit that I found it hard to concentrate on Mary Morris's novel, ''Acts of God.'' This is not a fact a reviewer should readily admit to, I know, particularly when talking about a book that is something of a page turner, but I think it is only fair to confess to the extraneous thoughts that kept buzzing around in my brain. At first they took the form of random game-show questions. (Sometimes difficult: For 500 points, name any other book in which not one but two characters are insurance claim adjusters. Sometimes easy: For 10 points, name at least 20 other books or movies in which the plot centers on a high school reunion.)</p>
        <p>But then the mental interference took a nasty turn. How many times is the author going to tell me exactly the same thing, describe exactly the same emotion? I was getting testy now. Aw, gee, do I really need to know exactly what sort of coffee her heroine orders at Starbucks? I was getting testy now. And where, by the way, was her editor when she needed him?</p>
        <p>Morris is no newcomer. She has published 10 other books, fiction and nonfiction. She has a nice, direct prose style and a flair for the melodramatic, both of which make for some good storytelling (hence the page turning). But this time the story is not sufficient.</p>
        <p>Tess Winterstone is a not-quite-50 single mom living in a precariously perched cottage (enter insurance man No. 1) on the California coast near San Francisco. Tess's finances are as shaky as her home's foundation, but she and her two nearly grown children get by on her salary as a part-time assistant to a real estate agent (she likes this work, which affords her access to other people's drawers) and some about-to-end child-support payments. Still, she manages to buy the groceries (and the Starbucks), drive a car, own a home, eat in tony San Francisco restaurants and fly on a fairly regular basis to Chicago (site of the aforementioned high school reunion). Now that's a book I would like to read: ''How to Do Everything You Want on No Money.''</p>
        <p>Tess has never really known what to do with herself -- she admits to being a woman of ''many passing interests'' -- but now she has come up with a make-ends-meet scheme that will cash in on the fact that her cottage was once the home of a mysterious poet whose fans are, well, fanatical in their devotion: She'll turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast, a mecca for the poet's disciples. The obstacles are many, but as Tess learned from her father (insurance adjuster No. 2), there are no problems, just solutions.</p>
        <p>But there are also setbacks. Tess has tossed away the invitation to her 30th high school reunion, but her children, perhaps imagining a weekend without mom, take matters into their own hands and charge the plane tickets to her Visa card. (Got to teach them young: fly now, pay later.) She goes, sees some old friends she doesn't much care about, a former boyfriend whom she sort of cares about, and Margaret Blair, the girl who took the boyfriend away from her those many years ago. Margaret is now married to another friend, drinks too much, talks too loudly and seems too glad to see Tess, who is not at all happy to see the woman who shares her family's deepest secret (all I'll tell you is that it involves insurance adjuster No. 2).</p>
        <p>EVENTUALLY, and here it gets complicated, Tess ends up getting even with Margaret -- but that's only temporary, a little digression on the road to finally facing up to her past and moving on with her life (let us not forget insurance adjuster No. 1).</p>
        <p>Tess accompanied her father when he went to disaster sites -- towns wiped out by flood or tornado -- and taught her early on ''the first law of insurance'': ''You can't protect anything that really matters. You can't insure love or health. You can't guarantee peace of mind or your place in the world.'' She learned that lesson so well that she forgot that he also taught her how to play the odds. It took her more than 30 years to remember -- and to figure out how not just to play them but to beat them.</p>
