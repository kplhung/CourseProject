        <p>The day before, when he learned he would be a surprise starter in the first game of the World Series, Jose Vizcaino said: ''It's like a dream come true. When you sign as a professional, it is your dream to go to the World Series. After 10 years, I have a chance to go to the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Before the start of Game 1 against the Mets last night at Yankee Stadium, someone asked Vizcaino if he would be disappointed if he were benched for Game 2 tonight. ''Even if I got 5 for 5 today and I don't play tomorrow, I'm still going to be happy,'' Vizcaino said.</p>

        <p>The day before, when he learned he would be a surprise starter in the first game of the World Series, Jose Vizcaino said: ''It's like a dream come true. When you sign as a professional, it is your dream to go to the World Series. After 10 years, I have a chance to go to the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Before the start of Game 1 against the Mets last night at Yankee Stadium, someone asked Vizcaino if he would be disappointed if he were benched for Game 2 tonight. ''Even if I got 5 for 5 today and I don't play tomorrow, I'm still going to be happy,'' Vizcaino said.</p>
        <p>His words proved almost prophetic and Joe Torre, the Yankee manager, may be tempted to use Vizcaino again at second base tonight. He got four hits in six trips to the plate. The final one was a single with the bases loaded and two outs in the 12th inning off Turk Wendell to give the Yankees a 4-3 victory in the first game of the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>''In that situation, bases loaded, you've got to throw strikes and I was just trying to hit the ball up the middle,'' Vizcaino said.</p>
        <p>Did he hope to get a chance to win the game?</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' Vizcaino said. ''I was feeling pretty good at the plate today. I was seeing the ball good. I really was glad that I came through.''</p>
        <p>He said his most tense moments came in the first inning, when he was on the field. ''I was really nervous,'' Vizcaino said. ''I was just praying that the first guy would hit a ground ball to me, and it happened. After that, I was fine.''</p>
        <p>Timo Perez, the Mets' leadoff hitter, started the Series by grounding a ball to second base, and Vizcaino threw him out.</p>
        <p>Vizcaino was a surprise starter in place of Luis Sojo, who usually plays in place of Chuck Knoblauch, who has fielding problems, particularly with throws to first. Torre said he decided to use Vizcaino in place of Sojo as the ninth hitter because Vizcaino had a 10-for-19 career mark against Al Leiter, the Mets' starter.</p>
        <p>Vizcaino, a former Met, discounted revenge as a factor in his motivation. ''It's not a payback,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that he was traded from Los Angeles during the season. ''I was really happy,'' Vizcaino said. ''I knew I was going to be traded because I wasn't playing. I asked the general manager where I was traded and he told me the Yankees and I was real happy.''</p>
        <p>Vizcaino is one of only two players in history to play for the Yankees, the Mets, the Giants and the Dodgers, the four teams that have called New York home. The other is Darryl Strawberry.</p>
