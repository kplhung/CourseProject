        <p>MONDAY is doomsday for restaurants, a Death Valley of empty seats, the biggest homebody day of the week. No wonder more eating places close on that day than any other. Then why, on a Monday night, are people scurrying across the parking lot at the Plainview Center and streaming into Ayhan's Shish Kebab Restaurant? The parade of patrons starts as early as 5 p.m. and rarely lets up until closing.</p>
        <p>Ayhan's, along with eating places that schedule Monday pasta nights, fixed-price dinners, menu discounts and senior citizen nights, makes Monday diners an offer they find difficult to refuse. Every Monday the Mediterranean restaurant, at 379 South Oyster Bay Road (516-827-5300), serves something called the sultan's sampling. It's a four-course, $9.95 Mediterranean sampling dinner that consists of a mezza, or appetizer plate; a Greek salad; four kebabs; a plate of tiny Middle Eastern pastries and coffee, tea or milk with warm (though stiff) pita bread; and yogurt and onion sauces thrown in.</p>

        <p>MONDAY is doomsday for restaurants, a Death Valley of empty seats, the biggest homebody day of the week. No wonder more eating places close on that day than any other. Then why, on a Monday night, are people scurrying across the parking lot at the Plainview Center and streaming into Ayhan's Shish Kebab Restaurant? The parade of patrons starts as early as 5 p.m. and rarely lets up until closing.</p>
        <p>Ayhan's, along with eating places that schedule Monday pasta nights, fixed-price dinners, menu discounts and senior citizen nights, makes Monday diners an offer they find difficult to refuse. Every Monday the Mediterranean restaurant, at 379 South Oyster Bay Road (516-827-5300), serves something called the sultan's sampling. It's a four-course, $9.95 Mediterranean sampling dinner that consists of a mezza, or appetizer plate; a Greek salad; four kebabs; a plate of tiny Middle Eastern pastries and coffee, tea or milk with warm (though stiff) pita bread; and yogurt and onion sauces thrown in.</p>
        <p>Delivered with assembly-line precision (no substitutions), the variety and quality of this meal make it a genuine bargain. Despite the rapidity with which the meal is served (appetizer and dessert plates are prepared in advance; they appear almost instantly), the Middle Eastern dishes in this low-cost mini-feast most often deliver pleasing flavors and vivid tastes. Dollops of hummus, a mash of chick peas, herbs and tahini, baba gannouj, or pureed oven-roasted eggplant salad laced with olive oil, tahini and herbs and tabbouleh, or bulgar salad (cracked wheat), with a cucumber and tomato garnish make for a diverse and refreshing first course.</p>
        <p>A dinner plate-size Greek salad covered by crumbled, imported feta cheese and studded with marinated calamata olives sustains the positive momentum. The entree -- chicken, beef and kofte (minced lamb and beef) kebabs and rotisserie-roasted sliced lamb on a mound of moist rice pilaf ringed by peas -- is a Mediterranean sampler unto itself. The beef on a skewer with onions and peppers was soft and juicy and the gyro, or savory lamb, sported lively spices. But the speared sausage-like kofte kebab was too timidly seasoned and the tasty grilled chicken breast chunks with mushrooms and onions were a tad overcooked.</p>
        <p>The dessert, like the starter plate, offers three tiny, interesting samples: baklava, sarayi (or bird's nest) and kadaif. All of them stress similar ingredients like phyllo dough, chopped nuts, sugar-lemon syrup and cinnamon that are layered, stuffed or rolled and then baked.</p>
        <p>Ayhan's Shish Kebab is not a hole-in-the-wall storefront, but a spacious, airy, all-white, 180-seat taverna. Its gleaming, open kitchen, archways, tile roofs, stucco walls, skylight and plants generate an authentic Middle Eastern milieu.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>La Bella Palermo, a 55-seat Italian restaurant, is scheduled to open this week or next at 127 Glen Head Road in Glen Head (no phone yet) where Pappagallo was. Jim Grasso, who until now was the chef and an owner of Trattoria Grasso in Cold Spring Harbor, and his partner, Frank Tini, own La Bella Palermo, which will specialize in classically prepared Italian dishes with ingredients like sepia, tripe and langoustines. Mr. Grasso said his new limited menu spot, with a wall-size mural of Palermo, tile floors and white tablecloths, would offer piano music on weeknights.</p>
        <p>Piccolo Mondo opened three months ago at 233 Doughty Boulevard in Inwood (516-371-0200) where La Sila had been. The 95-seat Northern Italian spot has its roots in Manhattan where Paul Vuli, the chef and owner of the restaurant, founded the original Piccolo Mondo. Dinner entrees at the new eating place are in the $12.95 to $19.95 category. The chef's signature dish, frequently offered as a nightly special, is pan-seared blue-fin tuna on sauteed spinach and black wild rice in a port wine reduction.</p>
        <p>The white tablecloth restaurant has cream colored walls and dark wood chairs, fixtures and a bar.</p>
        <p>Potpourri</p>
        <p>Collins and Main Restaurant and Lounge, at 100 Old South Main Street in Sayville (631-563-0805), has made all Tuesdays through the end of October ''Wine Lover's Nights.'' All wines on their list are at half price. Wednesdays are pasta nights when Niels Poluna, the chef, prepares at least four special pastas that are accompanied by a tumble salad and a choice of several desserts for $16.95.</p>
        <p>The Snapper Inn, 500 Shore Drive  (631-589-0248), Oakdale, is holding its annual Beer and Sausage Garden today from noon to 4 p.m. Henry Remmer, the restaurant's founder, started this tradition in 1929. The menu includes a dozen different sausages, sweet potato and potato pancakes, as well as cheese plates, smoked fish and hot pretzels. Refreshments will include Oktoberfest beers from the breweries of Paulander, Becks, Heineken and Blue Point. Music will be provided by Otto Weidner.</p>
        <p>Diane and John Durkin, in conjunction with Veuve Clicquot, are holding a $125 ''One of a Kind'' five-course tasting dinner at Trattoria Diane, 23 Bryant Avenue in Roslyn (516-621-2591) tomorrow from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. with all proceeds going to the Interfaith Nutrition Network. One course is porcini-crusted lamb loin.</p>
        <p>The George Martin Restaurant, at 65 North Park Avenue in Rockville Centre (516-678-7272), will hold a six-course, $75 wine dinner tomorrow featuring a variety of Kenwood wines.  The dinner, limited to 30 people, will take place in George Martin's private dining room. Double-rib lamb chops will be served with rosemary and an autumn vegetable cassoulet.</p>
        <p>Post Wine and Spirits, at 510 Jericho Turnpike in Syosset (516-921-1820), is presenting an introduction to wine beginning on Tuesday. The in-depth wine course will cover the major wine producing areas of the world.  The eight one-hour sessions will be followed by a tasting of 8 to 10 wines from the area covered. Following the lecture there will be a tasting of foods prepared by Tom Shaudel, the chef at Coolfish in Syosset. The cost of the complete course is $400. Individual sessions may be taken for $75.</p>
        <p>The San Marco Ristorante, at 658 Motor Parkway in Hauppauge (800-510-0088), will present a $65.95 fall harvest dinner on Wednesday at 7 p.m. Among the dishes is chicken breast in red wine over mushroom pate and stewed cotechino with beans paired with Amarone DOC 1995 Riaghetti.</p>

        <p>Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  A report in the A la Carte column last Sunday about La Bella Palermo, a restaurant scheduled to open in Glen Head, referred imprecisely to Pappagallo, a previous tenant at the location, 127 Glen Head Road. Pappagallo remains at 716 Glen Cove Avenue, where it moved two decades ago.</p>
