        <p>THE CASE OF DR. SACHS</p>
        <p>By Martin Winckler.</p>
        <p>Seven Stories, $27.95.+</p>
        <p>Family doctors have to bottle up their human urges: irritation, lust, exhaustion. Now the French novelist (and doctor) Martin Winckler pulls the cork. ''The Case of Dr. Sachs'' is a startlingly frank portrait of a small-town physician who acts as healer, confessor and scapegoat to an entire community. In this lively translation by Linda Asher, Winckler indulges in the kind of writing the French call experimentalism and the rest of us call plain old showing off. He sets much of his novel in the second person, with a different patient narrating each chapter. As the voices accrue, images of the doctor emerge: ''You look at me over your round glasses. Since you're always stooped, you often look at me over them.'' ''You're wearing a worn leather jacket.'' ''You're not as patient as you used to be.'' Winckler's use of the second person makes elegant sense: this is the right voice for recounting a life defined by other people's demands. Other rhetorical gambits prove more gimmicky, like the inclusion of snippets from Dr. Sachs's own fiction writing, from his diaries and from a manifesto entitled ''We Are All Nazi Doctors.'' Winckler is after a newfangled kind of literary platform here, one that will bear a career's worth of suppressed rage at medicine in general and patients in particular. (Mothers especially come in for a drubbing.) Just when a reader is becoming weary of all this narrative play, relief comes from an unexpected quarter. The second half of the novel blooms with a common, happy love story. Love is stubbornly traditional; it won't brook much experimental mucking around. Dr. Sachs's love affair returns the reader to novelistic terra firma, and not a moment too soon.</p>
