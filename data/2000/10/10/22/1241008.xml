        <p>The scene outside Yankee Stadium yesterday, as night fell and the noise rose, was a bazaar, filled with the wide-eyed and the mercilessly shrewd, the out-of-towners and the out-of-luck.</p>
        <p>Ticket scalpers, having worked since 8 a.m., moved under the elevated subway tracks on River Avenue. Upper-deck seats went for $850.</p>
        <p>Sailors, on shore leave and having been misled, came to discover that no, tickets would not be given out to any man in uniform.</p>
        <p>And as if to underscore the fact that unfairness was everywhere, Jose Gonzalez and his son Andre quietly took their place in the line for reserved seats. There would be no problem. Andre is a classmate of George Steinbrenner's grandson in Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>Julio and Irma Echevarria, who live nearby on University Avenue, brought their four children, Daniella, 13, Victor, 10, Jonathan, 8, and Jorge, 5. They were wearing blue Yankees T-shirts and caps and had come to watch the players arrive and ''feel the spirit,'' Mr. Echevarria said.</p>
        <p>And on it went outside the Stadium on the night the city had waited for for more than four decades -- incongruity and laughter, hard bargains and a thirst for baseball.</p>
        <p>At the entrance to the bleachers, Edward Nikles from Milford, Pa., held a $110 field box seat that he wanted to trade for a $50 bleacher seat. ''People think I'm crazy, but I'm a devoted Bleacher Creature,'' he said. He finally found a taker in Adam Maggio, 22, a college student from Forked River, N.J.</p>
        <p>Perhaps feeling most taken, though, were the two sailors standing forlornly outside the Stadium Club, dressed in blue bell bottoms and white sailor hats, holding their duffel bags and a couple of crumpled dreams.</p>
        <p>They were Jacob Ford, 22, from Colorado Springs and Scott Renshaw, 26, from Houston, petty officers from the United States Navy on shore leave from the U.S.S. Monterey, docked at Staten Island.</p>
        <p>They said their captain had told them they could get in the game for free if they showed up in their uniform. It did not work.</p>
        <p>Petty Officer Ford, a lifelong Yankee fan, scratched his crew-cut head. ''My whole life I've dreamed of being here and now it's shot down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And then there was the matter of the marching bands: they were from Nerw Jersey.</p>
        <p>''Hey, half the fans in there are from Jersey,'' said Alan M. Abraham, who coordinates the Jersey Shore All-Star Band and who said the request came from Steinbrenner himself.</p>
        <p>His band has been playing at Yankees postseason games (and their ticker-tape parades) since 1995.</p>
        <p>John and Joseph Michialis, 21-year-old twins from Astoria, Queens, work at a walk-up window restaurant on River Avenue, across from the Stadium.</p>
        <p>The brothers, both describing themselves as ''die-hard Yankee fans,'' were able to buy eight tickets for field box seats last week for Game 1. But they gave the tickets to their cousins visiting from Greece and decided to work instead, serving up $8 gyros to hungry fans.</p>
        <p>Business was booming all over. Some private lots were charging $38 for game parking. Entrepreneurs sold Subway Series T-shirts for $20.</p>
        <p>At Stan's Sports World, fans clamored for Subway Series merchandise. At 4:30 p.m., Giuseppe Conte, a store employee, told fans waiting out front that the store would close for a half-hour until shelves were restocked. Later, employees selected customers one at a time, like bouncers at a trendy nightclub.</p>
        <p>As celebrities like Jack Nicholson and Billy Joel arrived, children played pickup basketball and baseball games in the dusk in Macomb's Dam Park next to the stadium.</p>
        <p>Fans everywhere walked the perimeter of the Stadium holding fingers aloft to indicate the number of tickets they wanted to buy.</p>
        <p>George Dorazio, 33, and his brother Mike, 30, drove down from Providence, R.I., and were willing to pay up to $400 per seat, but scalpers were asking $850 for upper-deck seats. So they headed for the Yankee Tavern on Gerard Avenue and 161st Street, where a packed crowd cheered as the Yankees took the field.</p>
        <p>Over on 157th Street, a block from the Stadium, where you can see into a section of the upper deck and hear the crowd, neighborhood residents set up television sets on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>Winston Rosa, 31, and Jay DeLa Rosa, 23, carried a 27-inch set across the street and set it up outside the Fulanito Sports store. They raised the antenna, the screen showed the teams being introduced and there was no need for volume. The roar could be heard spilling over from the Stadium across the street.</p>
