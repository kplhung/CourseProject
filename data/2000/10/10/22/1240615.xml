        <p>FINGERS POINTING</p>
        <p>SOMEWHERE ELSE</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By Daniela Fischerova.</p>
        <p>Catbird, $19.95.</p>
        <p>Daniela Fischerova is part of what's been called the ''post-Kundera generation'' of Czech fiction writers, and this taut, intelligent collection of stories is her first to be published in English. Many of the seven stories here are about confinement and the struggle to escape it. In ''A Letter for President Eisenhower,'' a 10-year-old girl in Prague realizes with a jolt that both a school assignment -- to write an antiwar letter to the American president -- and a sexually charged summertime game were not at all what she had thought them to be. In another story, a Czech doctor, in an attempt to flee the stultifying world of his clinic and his parents, goes to an ashram in India only to find echoes of home everywhere: an obese pilgrim reminds him of his overweight mother; a missing swami, his absentee father. And in ''The Thirty-Sixth Chicken of Master Wu,'' the book's fullest and finest story, a court chef named Wu despairs over his inability to concoct a new chicken dish for the emperor's birthday. His nephew, a premodern poet with postmodern woes (''Poets don't create anymore! They just steal from each other!''), similarly frets over his inability to come up with something new. In the end, the nephew's poetic breakthrough earns him a death sentence, while Wu's dish -- which is described as ''so utterly unlike meat that tiny scandals were being played out in the delicate interplay'' of the eaters' senses -- garners the highest of honors. ''You've given us something unique to taste,'' the empress says. In this collection, elegantly translated by Neil Bermel, so too has Fischerova.</p>
