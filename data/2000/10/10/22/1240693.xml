        <p>IN the good old days, the 20's and 30's, when the powers in Hollywood liked to issue edicts about pictures being better than ever and a reliable route to prosperity, happiness and a flawless complexion for the optimum number of Americans, those powers were counting cards and shooting craps. They might  have been the highest-paid people in the land, as well as the providers of wholesome stories for the nation's young citizens, but they were late-night gamblers.</p>
        <p>As if they couldn't give up their daytime hazard of moviemaking (the closest the country had yet come to organized gaming), they played poker at the Clover Club off Sunset or in their own homes. I'm talking about Goldwyn, the Warners, Zanuck, Joe Schenck, Selznick, Eddie Mannix (from MGM), a few directors. They bet on horses, they bet on when the country would be at war, what a picture would do in its first week. They'd bet on anything, including who'd be the first at the table to leave his wife.</p>
        <p>But they didn't go to Las Vegas in those days; Vegas wasn't enough of a there yet. In 1930, there were only 5,000 people scattered around Las Vegas. (Reno, the same year, had more than 18,500.) And it was in 1931 that Nevada, in a desperate play for survival, claimed for itself not just gambling but divorce, after a six-week wait. Of course, Hollywood was famous for both practices, so it's interesting to ask why the film business at its most powerful didn't get behind Nevada then and there, finance it, promote it and thus guarantee those dire decades, the 50's and 60's, when television really ate into the movie market. Why didn't it? Simple hypocrisy. When Nevada took on gaming and divorce in 1931, it gave up the ghost of respectability and secured its depraved status in modern history.</p>
        <p>Hollywood never had the courage to go that far, openly. For Hollywood was promoting family values, industry, ambition and capital accumulation.</p>
        <p>Such thoughts ran through my mind as I watched ''Pay It Forward,'' which is either a new movie or a gamble about to pay off, depending on your point of view. When a publicity representative at Warner Brothers put in a follow-up call to see what I thought of the film, I tried to be flippant by saying we didn't want to get into that dark area. Warners itself had put forth the hope that no one would reveal the film's ending -- and I had already spent several days trying to forget it. Her silence intimidated me, so I said I was sure -- as I am -- that it's going to make a fortune.</p>
        <p>''Bless you, my dear,'' she sighed.</p>
        <p>It's not an easy film to write about under this constraint, for the ending (while being predictable) is monstrous, cruel and so manipulatively effective that decent people will totter into the night howling for comfort or a flag to rally round. If Frank Capra had made this picture (and his ghost must be dollar-green with envy), there would be Pay It Forward Boys and Girls Clubs about to spring up all over the nation as the picture opened.</p>
        <p>Let me just say that this is a film set in Las Vegas that hardly notices the Strip. Arlene McKinney (Helen Hunt) is a single mom who gets by as a cocktail waitress and a changemaker in places closer to Fremont Street (the old part of town). She has a boy, Trevor (Haley Joel Osment), who has a seventh-grade social studies teacher who could, on his own, boost Nevada's academic standing several notches. He's not quite real? No, but he's Kevin Spacey, and he gives Trevor's class an assignment: look at the world and fix the problem. Trevor, or Haley Joel (whose instincts are famous from ''The Sixth Sense''), gets an idea. If someone does you a good turn, don't pay them back, pay it forward, out into the world, so that random acts of kindness will act like a virus.</p>
        <p>The weird congruence of chain-letter benevolence and the possibility of some dream bonanza at the tables is not that far from what now passes for politics in America. And when it is seen from the wasteland fringes of Las Vegas it makes one of the most absurd but cunning movie models for happiness in recent times. I'm sure the moviemakers reckon themselves liberal and enlightened, yet the closing imagery is nothing more or less than a thousand points of light -- script by Leslie Dixon, direction by Mimi Leder.</p>
        <p>No stone of sentiment or cliche has been left unturned. And there is a wicked skill at work, as well as an exceptional range of acting. Ms. Hunt plays a drunk, in whom we see more ravaged drinking than real alcoholism, but she's impressive. Mr. Spacey is brilliant as ever. His character's problem in life is extensive burns, and I would say only that Mr. Spacey doesn't need such props. No matter how flawless his complexion, some shadow already guards his soul. It is what makes him so remarkable. As for Haley Joel Osment, with what is only his second lead part, he is a child actor who stirs adult anxieties like no one since Shirley Temple.</p>
        <p>The most intriguing thing about the picture is the way it uses Las Vegas as the ideal, emotional backdrop to a story about chance and happiness.</p>
        <p>Many Nevadans have observed the contrast in Vegas between natural light and neon. Well, ''Pay It Forward'' has one scene -- a kind of pilgrimage (I'll say no more) -- that gives that lighting scheme a new slant. It's a moment where you see how easily Vegas might be a magic city instead of the stale panorama of vulgarity.</p>
        <p>The nearest I'd come to feeling that moment before was Francis Ford Coppola's ''One From the Heart'' (1982), a famous disaster that went so far over budget it helped destroy Mr. Coppola's dream of a Los Angeles studio. But as designed by Dean Tavoularis and influenced by Zoetrope's then director emeritus, Michael Powell, ''One From the Heart'' did miraculous things with scrims and gauzes to depict suburban Las Vegas as a humdrum, tawdry place, with sand blowing though the houses, but still radioactive with a wistful version of the American dream. ''One From the Heart'' got out of hand, when it needed to stay modest; Coppola the gambler had been carried away, way past the wistful romantic. But it's a movie that deserves rediscovery, and part of its eloquence is in seeming to feel both the beauty and the terror of Nevada, the tacky outpost and the biblical city daring immolation.</p>
        <p>That oblique view of the city seems so much more precious than the grimly ugly ''Ocean's 11'' (1960, but coming again in a remake) in which Frank Sinatra, the Rat Pack and Angie Dickinson (she's in ''Pay It Forward,'' too) are in on a scheme to knock over five casinos at once. The Pack did a lot to keep Vegas in business once, and the legend goes that they had and gave a good time there.</p>
        <p>If only some of that showed in ''Ocean's 11.'' You can believe that Howard Hughes, owner of much of the board game in the 60's, preferred roaming the desert and waiting to be bumped into -- as in Jonathan Demme's beautiful ''Melvin and Howard'' (1980) -- before he went back home, to the Desert Inn, closed the blinds and watched movies, some of them his own (like Jane Russell in ''The Las Vegas Story,'' 1952), and some as giddy as ''Viva Las Vegas'' (1964), where Ann-Margret might have caught Hughes's eye with the chance of her flowing body taking flight.</p>
        <p>It's not Vegas, but I reckon Hughes would have enjoyed the paranoia of ''Mulholland Falls'' (1996) if he'd lived. That's a sad police story, with Nick Nolte as a Los Angeles cop who has to visit the Nevada Test Site to pursue a murder case. There he finds John Malkovich, as the Director, not just sick but disturbed as only that actor can be, given to telling Mr. Nolte's character that, with the space between atoms, they're all sitting on nothing. With scenes that show some of the craters at the atomic test site, places where 12 million tons of matter dematerialized in 1962, ''Mulholland Falls'' alludes to the old Nevadan light, too bright to be looked at yet a tourist show at 5:30 in the morning -- blast-off time -- when the casinos swayed like Ann-Margret. It also gives you a hint of how John Malkovich got to ''Being John Malkovich.''</p>
        <p>Of course, there are many facets to Nevada. In ''The Misfits'' (1961), John Huston went for wild horses, the country between Reno and Pyramid Lake, as well as Gable, Monroe and Clift. He shot in black-and-white, and he wanted a farewell to the western as much as a study in gambling. But it's better than its reputation.</p>
        <p>What's the best film about gambling? For me, it's Robert Altman's ''California Split'' (1974), with Elliott Gould and George Segal like the two halves of a gambler -- one wild, euphoric, hunchy; the other careful, inward, calculating, grief-stricken. It is set in Los Angeles and Reno, and it easily subscribes to fears that gambling is an illness -- one that has had its hooks in Mr. Altman.</p>
        <p>You could follow the supreme Mr. Gould there to his forlorn chump waiting to be offed in ''Bugsy'' (1991). I liked Warren Beatty's Ben Siegel, making a valiant effort to be out of control as well as a master of the same. But that film gets its history wrong and doesn't really settle what Virginia Hill was doing in town. Still, it's a tribute to the entrepreneurial vision that an air-conditioned orgy palace might be a hit just a few hours from Los Angeles. If only Selznick had gambled on that.</p>
        <p>There are other films I don't want to omit: ''Desert Bloom'' (1986), one of the few pictures to touch the subject of radiation illness; ''Desert Hearts'' (1985), in which a Reno divorcee (Helen Shavers) meets a cowgirl (Patrice Charbonneau) who swings the other way; it's a nice reminder of George Cukor's ''The Women'' (1939), made in the glory days of Reno romance. Martin Scorsese's ''Casino'' (1995) is not his best film, but Las Vegas has never looked more beautiful, and the film is full of wondrous details, like the Vegas vogue for fellatio, the Sharon Stone character's sense of decor and costume, and Robert De Niro's character's fastidious habit of taking his pants off to keep their crease straight and the ritual of taking a limo out into the desert and coming back one body lighter.</p>
        <p>CAN I claim ''Greed'' (1925)? No, but it's one of the supreme desert films, for which von Stroheim went to Death Valley in the hottest days and found that great image of gold merging with the shining dust. I'm also fond of ''Lost in America'' (1985), where the young couple loses everything at the casino and then the delicious Garry Marshall explains to them that yes, that can happen, and what would the world think if casinos gave the money back?</p>
        <p>Still, I have two favorites. The one is Mike Figgis's ''Leaving Las Vegas'' (1995), which sees the town for all the bad there is there, the epitome of tragedy, rape, death from self-destruction -- yet capable of that strange desert motel where the couple watch ''The Third Man.'' Then there is Paul Thomas Anderson's ''Hard Eight'' (1997) -- another ending not to be thrown away -- in which a factual, tough view of Reno, Vegas and the desert is actually a parable for an angel and his mission. He is a man called Sydney, and he's played by Philip Baker Hall. In any other state of the union, he'd be a figure of doom.</p>
        <p>But in Nevada the idea can dawn that there's a strange tenderness in those who have survived the ordeal -- whether that of pioneering the northern route or building Hoover Dam -- and seen a million come and go. Again and again. The life there requires rare people, and the proximity of harsh circumstances with offers of transformed lives can prompt irony, or madness. Most of us would go crazy there, move on or perish in the first extreme summer or winter. But Sydney is the spirit of Nevada: a parched survivor.</p>
