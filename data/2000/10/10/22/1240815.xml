        <p>AS a full-time artist, Jim Fuess fills canvases with vivid acrylics that he coaxes to flow, bubble, blend and feather into intriguing forms.</p>
        <p>As a part-time curator, Mr. Fuess helped shape the Merck 2000 Union County Juried Art Show at the Arts Guild of Rahway.</p>
        <p>As one of an estimated five million Americans who cope with essential tremor, a neurologic movement disorder, Mr. Fuess, 56, hopes to contribute his talents to the International Tremor Foundation. Catherine Rice, the executive director of the foundation, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., said Mr. Fuess's artwork might be reproduced on cards to raise money.</p>
        <p>Essential tremor is more common than Parkinson's disease and strikes as many as 1 in 20 people over age 40 and 1 in 5 people over age 65, according to the foundation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuess's condition is relatively mild, he said, and has not stopped him from creating thousands of paintings. A sampling is featured in a two-person show at the Brion Gallery in Lambertville, and in December he will have a one-person show at the Gallery Siano in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>For the Merck show, he helped winnow 225 pieces from 68 Union County artists to 41 works from 25 artists.</p>
        <p>Q. As curator of the Union County show, you also were a juror because one of the judges didn't show up, so you had a unique perspective on the entrants. Among them, did you notice any trends in techniques or themes?</p>
        <p>A. The submissions were very eclectic -- realistic, abstract, mixed media, photography, just about everything. We couldn't take sculpture because the work had to hang on the walls. The jurors try to represent each kind of work. The jurors are also there to find new work and new people. That's one of the nice things about a juried show, the work is not picked by a curator. All of a sudden you run across a new talent, and you say, ''Wow, who is that, where'd they come from?''</p>
        <p>Q. How did you become an artist?</p>
        <p>A. I was 30 years old. A friend of mine was going to Switzerland and left me a whole bunch of paint, brushes and canvas and said, ''Play with it.'' It never occurred to me that I'd be an artist.</p>
        <p>Q. How would you describe your art?</p>
        <p>A. Abstract, colorful, energetic, sometimes humorous, sometimes serious.</p>
        <p>Q. Speaking of energetic, is it true that you once completed a painting in three minutes?</p>
        <p>A. It took me 24 years to learn how to do ''Yellow Worm on Red'' in three minutes. I finished the painting, ran out of the house, jumped in my car, and went for a long drive so I wouldn't come back and mess with the painting. Sometimes you just get it right.</p>
        <p>Q. You've been an artist for 26 years and yet you've kept your condition, essential tremor, pretty private.</p>
        <p>A. It's obvious when I'm in public. People ask, I tell them; I don't volunteer. It just doesn't come up. I've had the tremor since I was born. About six months ago I joined the support group put on the Internet by the International Tremor Foundation.</p>
        <p>Q. What parts of your body are affected?</p>
        <p>A. In my case, mostly my hands. It can affect your voice, arms, legs, head, individually or collectively. There are medications, and I'm afraid of what they would do to me personally and artistically. They all have side effects, not everything works, and lethargy is one of those things that scares the hell out of me.</p>
        <p>Q. How does essential tremor affect your day-to-day activities?</p>
        <p>A. I don't go to soup-eating contests in biker bars. If I order peas, I order mashed potatoes. Other than that, you know, I don't let it affect me. I don't mix nitroglycerine in the backyard. Obviously, there are parameters of what's possible and what's not possible.</p>
        <p>Q. How have you had to accommodate your painting style?</p>
        <p>A. I'm not a super-realist; I'm not a pointillist. Rather than use a brush, I use squeeze bottles of liquid paint of various densities.</p>
        <p>Q. You were reluctant to go public about your essential tremor because you did not want to be forever-after put in the category of ''disabled artist.'' What made you change your mind?</p>
        <p>A. Everybody belongs to a community, has an obligation to that community, and I feel that I am a part of and owe an obligation to the E.T. community.</p>
