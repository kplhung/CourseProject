        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I've no idea whether New York could support a London-style series of Promenade Concerts. I do know that Sheldon Kritz (Letters, Oct. 15) is the latest in a long line of Americans who simply can't understand the Proms. I'll bet, for example, that the ''regular repertory'' Andre Kostelanetz played in New York in the 60's along with ''light pop'' and ''light classics'' did not include Schoenberg's ''Gurrelieder,'' the Monteverdi Vespers, symphonies by Mahler or Bruckner, works by Boulez, Stockhausen and Elliott Carter, or premieres of new pieces by Maxwell Davies and Thomas Ades, all of which have been performed at the Henry Wood Proms.</p>

        <p>Removing some seats in the orchestra does not guarantee that you'll duplicate the spirit of the London concerts. There is an enormous difference between the world's most attentive audience standing for a complete performance of the Berlioz Requiem and a bunch of well-heeled patrons sitting at cafe tables sipping drinks and eating snacks to the accompaniment of the Litolff Scherzo and the music from ''Star Wars.''</p>
