        <p>THE most ambitious real estate venture undertaken since the redevelopment of this city's downtown 30 years ago, a $200 million mixed-use waterfront complex to be built on 40 acres along the west branch of Stamford Harbor, is being hailed in many quarters of Stamford as a long-sought catalyst for the rebirth of the city's troubled South End peninsula.

        <p>THE most ambitious real estate venture undertaken since the redevelopment of this city's downtown 30 years ago, a $200 million mixed-use waterfront complex to be built on 40 acres along the west branch of Stamford Harbor, is being hailed in many quarters of Stamford as a long-sought catalyst for the rebirth of the city's troubled South End peninsula. But the project is so large that some are already questioning certain details.</p>
        <p>Called Admiral's Wharf, the 1.2 million square foot proposal includes a 250,000 square foot office building and 516 units of rental apartments and condominiums; a 200-room conference and corporate training center; a ferry service to New York, New Haven and area airports; 50,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; and parking for 2,300 cars. The project is an expanded version of a similar development called the Strand, proposed 10 years ago by the same developer, Arthur Collins Sr., chairman of Collins Enterprises of Greenwich.</p>
        <p>Except for two marinas at the southern end, the acreage, which lies across the street from a Pitney Bowes manufacturing complex on Washington Boulevard and Dyke Lane, has been vacant since the 70's, when the owner, United Illuminating, dismantled a coal gasification plant. Left behind was a stew of coal tars, cadmium, arsenic, lead, petroleum and PCB's, according to John DeVillars, executive vice president of Brownfields Stamford, the company that will do the cleanup.</p>
        <p>The cost, to be borne by the utility, is estimated by the developer at $10 million to $15 million, and the purchase price of the property to be paid by Mr. Collins and his partners is ''slightly under $40 million,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When the real estate market became mired in the recession 10 years ago, financing was not available for Mr. Collins's original project, the Strand -- a $90 million  development that was to have contained  85,000 square feet of offices, 200 condominium units, a 20-room waterside hotel, shops and restaurants. Mr. Collins kept his option on the property and two years ago formed a partnership with John H. McClutchy, head of JHM Ventures L.L.C., apartment developers headquartered in Stamford, and with Brownfields Stamford L.L.C., a subsidiary of the Boston-based Brownfields Recovery Corporation. Together, as Strand-BRC Group, they responded to a request by United Illuminating for new proposals and were accepted.</p>
        <p>''Real estate market issues were very different in 1990,'' Mr. Collins said. ''Overbuilding had caused some two million square feet of office vacancies. Our market now is very strong, with low office vacancies and a substantial housing shortage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McClutchy said: ''Arthur and I are putting together the financing and getting the land approvals. We have had discussions with interested bankers and with corporations interested in waterfront locations. The conference center was planned on the advice of Pitney Bowes, who told us there is a desperate need for this type of building.'' The company has been across from the Admiral's Wharf site since the 20's.</p>
        <p>Do H. Chung &amp; Partners of Stamford have been the architects for both the Strand and Admiral's Wharf. Mr. Chung described the new project as Georgian colonial in style with no building exceeding five stories. The commercial buildings and conference center will be built of brick, and the residential structures will be brick and clapboard or shingle. ''A tower element, like a lighthouse, might be at the ferry terminal,'' he said, ''and the conference center will be a signature building -- the first one people see coming down Washington Boulevard.'' The landscaped open space will include a linear park that conforms to the city's plan for a public walk along its entire waterfront.</p>
        <p>Stamford's Mayor Dannel P. Malloy, who is committed to opening the South End to a flow of commerce and people, said, ''The Collins project addresses the kind of issues in housing and public access to the water that will enable the South End to undergo redevelopment.''</p>
        <p>The peninsula, extending from Interstate 95 and the Metro-North and Amtrak railroad tracks south to the water, was once a manufacturing engine that drove the city's economy through World War II. Today, it is a patchwork of decaying industrial plants and ethnic residential neighborhoods, where the rate of home ownership has dropped to less than 10 percent.</p>
        <p>David Anderson, president of the Stamford Partnership, a 20-year-old economic development agency made up of city officials, business executives and representatives of South End neighborhoods, has been involved in the site since the 80's. ''At that time,'' he said, ''we proposed that the industrial zoning be changed on the master plan to Design Waterfront District for mixed use, and we recommended the Collins organization as developers.''</p>
        <p>IN an agreement between Mr. Collins and the partnership, the developer was to supply a percentage of low-cost housing at the Strand by donating $2 million in cash or construction. He is still committed to the idea, but, he said, ''Whether we go to the 70 percent market and 30 percent below-market set by the state or work something out with the city, it's too early to say.''</p>
        <p>Providing housing that middle income people can afford is a constant priority in the city. ''With a median area income of more than $102,000,'' Mr. Anderson said, both the number of below-market-rate housing units and the income qualifications for them ''that the city will accept will require some negotiation.'' He noted that Stamford's master plan requires developers of such special districts to submit site plans for uses and design for city approval. ''That puts the city and the community in the driver's seat for what should and should not happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson criticized the proposed office building for Admiral's Wharf for ''taking a bite out of downtown -- in the wrong location for a building that size.'' He added, ''There are downtown sites that could be available for offices,'' naming an empty parcel behind the Stamford Town Center mall and a property approved for offices that Hines Interests never built.</p>
        <p>Concerns that were raised 10 years ago are expected to resurface at public hearings. Many small business and restaurant owners in the central business district who regarded the Strand as a competing second city on the other side of the tracks still do.</p>
        <p>And Pitney Bowes has questions about traffic. According to Mary Maarbjerg, executive director of real estate for the company, ''any project that affects the infrastructure of the area affects us.'' She continued, ''We have 3,000 employees in several buildings -- 1,800 in the manufacturing plant across from Admiral's Wharf.'' The number of cars and their comings and goings, she said, ''need to be coordinated with our employees' hours and with our incoming and outgoing truck traffic.''</p>
        <p>The two marinas that will remain on the property will become tenants of Collins Enterprises. The Ponus Yacht Club and Brewer's Yacht Haven Marina currently lease about 14 acres of the tract from United Illuminating. Jack Brewer, owner of Yacht Haven and 16 additional Brewer's marinas between Mamaroneck, N.Y., and South Freeport, Me., said, ''We expect to add 50 or 60 slips and install new lifts and floats.''</p>
        <p>The Strand-BRC Group has applied to the city to bring an eight-acre industrially zoned parcel of the site into conformance with the Design Waterfront District and will embark next month on public hearings, site plan approvals, many months of cleanup and certification by state and federal environmental agencies. Construction is expected to begin in the spring of 2002, and completion could take another four years.</p>
        <p>Throughout its 30-year history the Collins organization has focused primarily on developing waterfront properties from Norwalk, Conn., to Norfolk, Va. ''Waterfront development is harder to do,'' Mr. Collins said, ''because of the environmental issues, but it's resistant to recessions, moves faster, and the values are higher because there is so much less of it.'' Between 1978 and 1990 he developed 45 acres of the east branch of Stamford Harbor with 725,000 square feet of offices, 231 condominium units and 570 boat slips in four complexes. Over all, he has developed more than one million square feet of offices and 1,500 residential units.</p>
        <p>Richard W. Redniss, whose company, Redniss &amp; Mead, is a land planning consultant for numerous projects in the area, including Collins's, agrees with supporters of the project. ''Admiral's Wharf,'' he said, ''marks the beginning of a renaissance in the South End. A hundred and fifty years ago it was an important port, and 75 years ago its industries provided a substantial percentage of the city's jobs. Today, gentrification has a high probability,'' he said, noting that commuters will be attracted to waterfront housing only one-third of a mile from the railroad station. ''We need to work on managing growth with the people who live and work there and the companies that are located there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  An article in some copies last Sunday about development plans for a 40-acre site on the Stamford, Conn., waterfront misidentified the former owner. It was Northeast Utilities, not the United Illuminating Company.</p>
