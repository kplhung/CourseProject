        <p>Move over, Earl. There's a new trendy denim line in town, and it also has a man's name on the label: Frankie B. The collection, inspired by ''Charlie's Angels,'' was created by Daniella Clarke of Los Angeles, who has been recutting and resewing her own jeans to make them extra tight and low-slung since she was 12.</p>
        <p>''People would stop me on the street and say, 'Where did you get those jeans?' '' Ms. Clarke said. ''I heard it so often, I thought -- light bulb! -- this is what I should be doing.''</p>

        <p>Move over, Earl. There's a new trendy denim line in town, and it also has a man's name on the label: Frankie B. The collection, inspired by ''Charlie's Angels,'' was created by Daniella Clarke of Los Angeles, who has been recutting and resewing her own jeans to make them extra tight and low-slung since she was 12.</p>
        <p>''People would stop me on the street and say, 'Where did you get those jeans?' '' Ms. Clarke said. ''I heard it so often, I thought -- light bulb! -- this is what I should be doing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Clarke, who is married to Gilby Clarke, a former guitarist with Guns 'n' Roses, named the company after their daughter. Though the company has been in existence for two years, the jeans only recently made their way to New York.</p>
        <p>In May, the actress Carmen Electra, clad in Frankie B., was interviewed at an Intermix boutique for the entertainment news show ''Access Hollywood.'' ''The saleswomen were freaking out over Carmen's jeans,'' Khajak Keledjian, Intermix's owner, said. ''We had never seen them cut so low.''</p>
        <p>By late summer, he ordered them for his two New York stores, and now, he said, he must reorder them twice a week to meet demand. Prices for the line usually range from $95 to $150.</p>
        <p>Ms. Clarke's clothes are also at Patricia Field and Bendel's, at $100 for jeans, $110 for jackets and $150 for a new Farrah Fawcett-style jumpsuit.</p>
