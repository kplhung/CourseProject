        <p>IT is no surprise to discover links between the Argentina-born artist Osvaldo Romberg and the literary magician Jorge Luis Borges.</p>
        <p>Borges, though blind and often hidden away in dusty library stacks, where he knew books more by their smell than their small black print, was nonetheless a towering presence in the artistic circles of Buenos Aires until his death in 1986. He lived on the Calle Maipu, across the street from the Cafe el Moderno, where writers and painters, including the young Mr. Romberg, met for their daily fix of caffeine and heady conversation.</p>
        <p>In front of the cafe was a public telephone that Borges found his way to everyday, sometimes helped across the street by the admiring Mr. Romberg, who could see him coming from his table inside the smoky cafe. In his future work Mr. Romberg would translate many of the writer's ideas about the cosmos into the language of visual art. ''I was particularly interested in his belief that 'everything touches everything,' '' Mr. Romberg says.</p>
        <p>As if in homage to this writer who had traveled to so many distant worlds and cultures only inside his head, Mr. Romberg created a multisite installation that dealt, in his words, with ''all things.'' It opened in 14 museums throughout the world on the same day in 1996, in cities like Budapest, Tel Aviv, Odessa, Tokyo and, of course, Buenos Aires. Titled ''+2000/-2000, Even,'' the installation did indeed embrace cultural and artistic history from Mesopotamia in the 18th century B.C. to the United States in the 20th century. ''It covered everything,'' the artist says, from ''gods and prostitutes'' to ''chaos theory and the marriage of Jacqueline Kennedy to Aristotle Onassis.''</p>
        <p>In his short story ''The Aleph'' Borges laments, ''Our minds are porous with forgetfulness.'' For more than 40 years, in work that includes meticulous figurative paintings, conceptual collages, land art, videos and now puppets, Mr. Romberg, 62, has refused the lapses of memory that time insists upon. Like Borges, whose life's work was nothing less than finding words to express the universe, Mr. Romberg, only slightly less inclusive, has mined every nook in the history of art and created a visual world of allusions and reinventions that equates art history with the history of humankind itself.</p>
        <p>''He has tremendous erudition mixed with a wonderful sense of the burlesque,'' says Dominique Nahas, a New York-based critic and independent curator.</p>
        <p>Burlesque, indeed; it runs through his new show, ''Besame Mucho: A Hypertext About Love,'' a meditation on the illusions of love opening on Thursday at White Box in Chelsea. Here Mr. Romberg has life-size transparent plastic dolls gyrating throughout the space to music spilling out of a full-wall video projection. The lovers in the video are characters from paintings by a host of artists, including Leonardo, Rubens, Bellini, Peter Christus and Seurat. But unlike appropriationists who ''borrow'' images, Mr. Romberg actually recreates the originals with his own hand. He is, above all, an excellent craftsman.</p>
        <p>The son of Russian immigrants who settled in Buenos Aires in 1904, Mr. Romberg began painting at 6, copying the advertisements for medicines that his father, a physician, received in the mail. ''These promotional packets always had classic paintings in them,'' Mr. Romberg said in an interview in his spacious SoHo studio, where a remarkable copy of Caravaggio's ''David and Goliath'' awaited completion on an easel. Like other paintings in his continuing historical series, this vividly bloody portrait will likely be overlaid with several abstract, geometric markings that serve both to highlight the illusions of representation and suggest relationships between different periods of art history. The result will never be mistaken for a forgery.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1950's, Mr. Romberg entered the University of Buenos Aires to study architecture, which, as he says, is ''the closest thing to art that is still a profession.'' Though he spent six years in this pursuit, he quit before graduating, much to his father's dismay, to devote himself full time to painting. ''Architecture depends too much on the client,'' he says wryly. ''I need complete control.''</p>
        <p>HIS architectural roots have remained evident in his work, however. ''My vision of the world is that of an architect,'' he says. ''I like complexity of thinking but simplicity of presentation.'' In several installations over the years he re-created ground plans from historically significant sites and placed them in new contexts. In 1995 he constructed full-size excavated architectural ''footprints'' of the sacred plaza of Machu Picchu in Peru in the desert outside Mitzpe Ramon in Israel and in the garden of the Palazzo Branchetti in Venice.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Romberg the functional methods of architecture serve as a container for his conceptual investigations. In common with Robert Smithson, Bruce Nauman, Nancy Holt, Gordon Matta-Clark and others, Mr. Romberg sees architecture as a means of extending the practice of art beyond the traditional confines of painting and sculpture. But this is not all. He has repeatedly used the tools and trappings of architecture (photographs and charts placed on display tables, drawings on tracing paper) to construct maps that guide viewers to revelations about the human condition. ''I am an engineer of emotions,'' he says, ''a conceptualist unafraid of deep feelings.''</p>
        <p>Throughout his professional life, Mr. Romberg has kept his ideas fresh by teaching. ''I need to teach,'' he says. ''I need that contact with new questions and new ways of thinking.'' Even as a student himself in architecture school he was tapped to conduct introductory courses.</p>
        <p>It was while teaching at Tucuman University in northern Argentina in the late 60's that Mr. Romberg began to feel the encroaching danger of the country's military dictatorship. Some of his politically active students were ''disappearing,'' and, he says, he had been frisked on the street for no apparent reason.</p>
        <p>He accepted an offer to teach at the Bezalel Academy of Art in Tel Aviv for what he thought would be two years. By his 11th year he had become head of the fine arts department, and his work had been featured in biennials, museum shows and solo exhibitions in Paris, London, Vienna, Tokyo and many other parts of the world. His first show in New York was in 1985 at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery on 57th Street. He is currently a professor of art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he also maintains a studio.</p>
        <p>''Whatever else you say about me, please say that I am fundamentally a family man,'' implores Mr. Romberg, the father of four. Ever attuned to the conceptual, he continues: ''The family is a permanent dialogue with the present. There's always some problem to solve.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Romberg problems are fundamental to art. ''I don't think art has to amuse or entertain,'' he says. ''I see myself as an investigator of problems: historical, political, cultural, sexual.'' As it was for Borges, art for Osvaldo Romberg is the way out of the labyrinth.</p>
