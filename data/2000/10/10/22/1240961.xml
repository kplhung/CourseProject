        <p>At the dawning of a new century and millennium, the United States Army is undertaking what its chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, calls a ''transformation.''</p>
        <p>This is a big deal, so big, in fact, that last week the general announced that all of his soldiers would get new caps.</p>
        <p>Starting next year, standard headgear for the Army's 480,000 soldiers and officers -- its cooks, its clerks, its drivers -- will be the black beret, which since 1975 has been the exclusive symbol of the Army's elite infantry cadre, the Rangers.</p>
        <p>This sartorial transformation spells the end of the rectangular hat -- known officially as the ''overseas cap,'' but more familiarly refered to as the ''envelope hat'' since it folds up as neatly as an envelope -- that has been in use for much of the past century.</p>
        <p>General Shinseki announced his directive in a speech devoted to the challenges facing the Army, which has been slow to adapt to today's post-cold-war world.</p>
        <p>The black beret, he said, would symbolize his own proposals to make the Army a leaner, more agile force, ready to fight and win anywhere in the world.</p>
        <p>''It will be a symbol of unity, a symbol of Army excellence, a symbol of our values,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>As symbolism goes, however, the directive fell flat.</p>
        <p>At a time when the Army is struggling to recruit soldiers, hold on to its young officers and maintain its tactical relevance when wars are far more likely to be fought with jets and missiles than ground troops, many soldiers called the beret little more than window dressing.</p>
        <p>Others gripes were more immediate.</p>
        <p>''The beret leaves lines on your forehead,'' one staff sergeant said.</p>
        <p>As could have been predicted, the harshest response came from the Rangers. Like the Army's airborne soldiers, who wear maroon berets, and the special forces, who wear green (and who, contrary to Hollywood habit, do not like to be called ''green berets'') the Rangers consider the black beret a hard-earned badge of honor.</p>
