        <p>Bell Park Manor Terrace apartments, a complex of brick and timber garden apartments that houses  middle-income, mostly elderly people, is usually a quiet place.</p>
        <p>But during the school day, residents say, teenagers from a neighboring high school trample the grass and throw empty beer bottles on the ground. Recently, residents have discovered more covert activities. They say students have been going into the garages and laundry rooms to take drugs and have sex.</p>
        <p>''I've seen several guys and one girl, willingly, with no abuse,'' said Kathi Taylor, president of the Bell Park Manor Terrace Community Council. ''I've seen that quite a few times.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Taylor said she had found drug pipes, straws and half-smoked marijuana cigarettes on the floor of the laundry room. She has also seen dozens of students loitering on the apartment grounds drinking alcohol.</p>
        <p>The residents think the students are from Martin Van Buren High School, which borders the complex, at 229th Street and Hillside Avenues.  The community group and managers of Bell Park have asked the police to arrest students for illegal behavior and to step up patrols.</p>
        <p>Deputy Inspector Glen Kotowski of the 105th Precinct said that two officers were assigned to the complex and that one student had been arrested for possession of drugs.</p>
        <p>James Lyons, who manages the 850-unit complex, said that the problem had existed for years and that while he has seen some improvement in the last year residents were still unhappy. In 1999, Mr. Lyons asked school officials to stop members of a health class from walking through the complex. The school did so. But since the more recent incidents he has been working with the police rather than school officials.</p>
        <p>Peter Goldfien, the principal, said that since school began this year he had received only one complaint from a Bell Park resident. ''We're a good school,'' he said. ''I'm not saying we don't have kids who do the wrong things. We're like a mini-city of teenagers, and sometimes they will do the wrong thing. We always address the issue when it's brought to our attention.''</p>
