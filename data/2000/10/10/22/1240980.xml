        <p>As mutual fund tax information starts arriving in the mail, many investors are again reminded that mutual funds are not always tax-efficient.</p>
        <p>The surging stock market of 1999 helped funds build up large gains, but many funds had to distribute those gains this year after skittish investors sold shares as the market dipped.</p>
        <p>John A. Battaglia, director of taxes at Deloitte &amp; Touche, said investors might be able to minimize capital-gains taxes by putting off buying more shares until after the record date for dividends. Their tax savings, he said, will depend on what they paid for their shares, the size of the distribution and whether it is considered long term -- held for more than a year.</p>
        <p>Investors can also save tax dollars by putting off the purchase of more shares until after dividends are paid, generally in November and December, Mr. Battaglia said. (Exact distribution dates are available from fund companies.) When individuals do buy, they should consider funds that replace their holdings infrequently and pass along fewer gains to shareholders, he said. A fund's turnover ratio can be found in the ''financial highlights'' section of its prospectus.</p>
        <p>Less tax-efficient funds may be best held in 401(k) or other tax-deferred retirement plans, where earnings build up tax-free until withdrawals begin.</p>
