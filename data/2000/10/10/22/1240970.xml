        <p>I want a lavish funeral and don't want to spend my own money on it.</p>
        <p>But in return for generous support from the funeral industry, I can offer an A-list of big-spending friends who will most certainly need funeral-related services in the future. Furthermore, I'm willing to offer funeral parlors, morticians, florists, hearse companies and mercy-dinner caterers advertising space in the prayer booklet distributed at my funeral Mass.</p>
        <p>A spokesman from some life insurance firm may even offer a tasteful sales pitch during the eulogies. And I'll certainly have a gravestone large enough to sport several corporate logos.</p>

        <p>If all this sounds like a morbid send-off, too bad! I am merely following the advice of one of the corporate-sponsored brides when she tells me to ''be thick-skinned and treat it like a business endeavor.''</p>
