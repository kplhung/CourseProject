        <p>HARRY CLARK, the founder of Chamber Music Plus, is often asked where he learned so much about music history.</p>
        <p>''The backs of record jackets'' is his answer. It's an education that is not available these days when music comes in more compact packages.  ''With CD's you hardly have that kind of writing,'' he said by phone from Hartford. ''It's basically in four languages and it's too small.''</p>

        <p>HARRY CLARK, the founder of Chamber Music Plus, is often asked where he learned so much about music history.</p>
        <p>''The backs of record jackets'' is his answer. It's an education that is not available these days when music comes in more compact packages.  ''With CD's you hardly have that kind of writing,'' he said by phone from Hartford. ''It's basically in four languages and it's too small.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago Mr. Clark, a cellist, turned his knowledge into a classical music experience called Parallel Portraits. Using costumed actors and spoken words integrated with chamber music played by Mr. Clark and his wife, the pianist Sanda Schuldmann, the programs illuminate the life of a famous musical figure through the eyes of a close friend or colleague.</p>
        <p>''Mazurka: A Parallel Portrait of Frederic Chopin and August Franchomme'' will be presented Friday at 8 p.m. at the Polka Dot Playhouse in Bridgeport. The production will star Keir Dullea as August Franchomme, Chopin's cello-playing friend. While Chopin wrote primarily for solo piano, Mr. Clark is convinced that the composer's few wonderful works for piano and cello were inspired by Franchomme.</p>
        <p>Far more research than record jackets went into the script, which Mr. Clark wrote. ''It's really Chopin through Franchomme's eyes, their friendship, how their careers developed in Paris,'' he explained. ''There are letters between them, and people who remember Chopin, such as Delacroix, Liszt and George Sand. There's quite a wealth of material. It's historical fiction.''</p>
        <p>Describing the program as ''a marriage of scripts and music,'' Mr. Clark said: ''We get to play smaller works that you wouldn't program. It shows a whole other side of a composer. These pieces were not composed in a vaccuum. It's usually written for someone, circumstances in their life that helped create it, what else was happening that might have affected people's decisions.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Clark hopes that Chamber Music Plus will help replenish the audience for chamber music, which is both dwindling and aging.</p>
        <p>''You've got to do a little something to get people out of their chairs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For the roles in his productions, Mr. Clark enlists actors and actresses who make their home in Connecticut. In addition to Mr. Dullea, other productions will feature Barbara Feldon in ''A Stopped Clock: From Brahms to Bloomsbury,'' in which the actress will portray Dame Ethel Smyth on Dec. 8, and Jill Clayburgh as Jenny Lind in ''Patience for the Harvest: Jenny Lind and Emily Dickinson,'' to be presented in February.</p>
        <p>''Mazurka: A Parallel Portrait of Frederic Chopin and August Franchomme'' featuring Keir Dullea as August Franchomme, with the cellist Harry Clark and the pianist Sanda Schuldmann, on Friday at 8 p.m., at the Polka Dot Playhouse, 177 State Street, Bridgeport. Tickets: $30; information: (203) 333-3666.</p>
