        <p>The isolation of the Rampart Crash unit is critical. The officers concluded at some point, not illogically, that their duty was not to uphold the law but to suppress crime, and that the bad guys do not follow the rules. Stopping them, therefore, meant they didn't need to follow the rules, either. This is the stuff of popular fiction.</p>
        <p>Had the officers themselves not crossed over and become drug dealers and criminals, this way of doing things could still be going on. The statistics looked good, and those who should have reined them in did not. Hence, a dangerous freedom was allowed for these officers to do what they would, isolated from the demands of law.</p>
