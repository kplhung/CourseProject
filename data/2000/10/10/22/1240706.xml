        <p>To the Editor: After a meeting in Dallas, I must comment on Kathryn Jones's article ''What's Doing in Dallas'' (Sept. 24).</p>
        <p>The map accompanying the article shows three of the four gigantic freeways extending indefinitely into the vastness of the Texas plains and  enclosing the Big D's ''downtown,'' a roughly 10-by-10-block rectangle.

        <p>To the Editor: After a meeting in Dallas, I must comment on Kathryn Jones's article ''What's Doing in Dallas'' (Sept. 24).</p>
        <p>The map accompanying the article shows three of the four gigantic freeways extending indefinitely into the vastness of the Texas plains and  enclosing the Big D's ''downtown,'' a roughly 10-by-10-block rectangle.  From the 38th floor of my hotel, the view of three of these highways and their intricate interchanges was endlessly fascinating -- the most fascinating thing, in fact, about the city.  Within the rectangle, a look from the other side of the hotel revealed city streets strangely devoid of either vehicular or pedestrian traffic.</p>
        <p>At the opposite end of downtown  from my hotel was the ''entertainment neighborhood'' of about three square blocks, with restaurants, clubs, an outdoor sound stage being loudly used when I was there and an indoor multifloor arcade mostly populated by groups of teenagers. Between these poles were a few more-or-less monumental streetscapes, with a very light scattering of on-street attractions. But just one block south of the monumental area and still well within the downtown rectangle was a long street of dereliction and decay.</p>
        <p>Despite a very promising light-rail system centered on the downtown rectangle, one gets the distinct impression that the Dallas downtown, and by extension the whole area, is far beyond any possibility of reurbanization.</p>
        <p>But Dallas is not unique. It's as though urbanity has been reduced to a hobby, like classical music, and there are just enough such hobbyists to populate New York and San Francisco.</p>
