        <p>THE world looks different at 175 miles per hour. This vast alkaline lake bed turns to a creamy blur as the Porsche 911 Turbo skims across its surface at 257 feet per second. Traffic cones, a quarter-mile apart, appear as orange pinpoints on the heated horizon, then streak past every 5 seconds or so.</p>
        <p>Behind me, the 3.6-liter turbocharged engine of the Porsche 911 Turbo moans evenly and, combined with the hissing wind and roaring Pirelli tires, the sound inside the car melds into superheated white noise, the deafening silence of dreams.</p>
        <p>This desert, more than 300 square miles of crusty playa stretching north from Reno, is where in 1997 Richard Noble's ThrustSSC jet car broke the sound barrier and set the current land speed record. It is also famous as the home of the annual Burning Man alternative arts festival. In the unforgiving heat of July, Porsche has brought its own pagan celebration to Black Rock, inviting journalists to drive its fierce 2001-model 911 Turbo as fast as they dare.</p>
        <p>The exercise has turned more interesting than expected. When Porsche officials scouted the area in May -- with the help of the United States Automobile Club, the keeper of speed records -- the alkaline surface, washed by the spring melt and baked by the sun, had turned to the consistency of sidewalk pavement. Now, after fits of rain, the playa is loose and crumbly.</p>
        <p>The wind has also turned treacherous. The program calls for each driver to make two passes, down and back, with the resulting speeds being averaged to cancel out the effects of tailwinds and headwinds. But since the wind is so high and swirling, it is decided that the drivers will make one pass only, downwind, and instead of a two-mile timing area, the auto club will lay out a mile-long top speed zone, the classic flying mile. This will lower the top speeds but will also expose drivers to less risk from violent wind shear.</p>
        <p>I am the first journalist to try a high-speed run. (Do they consider me expendable?)</p>
        <p>My co-pilot is the world's top endurance racer, Hurley Haywood, who has claimed multiple wins at Le Mans, Daytona and Sebring for Porsche. I throttle up the car on my way toward the timing traps two miles away. The new 911 Turbo, equipped with all-wheel-drive, Porsche's stability-control system and enormous 13-inch disc brakes behind 18-inch wheels, is exceedingly stable and benign at speed. Our test car has the additional reassurance of a roll cage bolted into the cabin. The car accelerates through 100 m.p.h. with bored nonchalance.</p>
        <p>But any car with 415 horsepower requires a light touch on such a loose surface. At Mr. Haywood's urging, I shift well short of the redline up through the gears, stretching the revs in fifth before the timing traps come into view. I hold the steering wheel with my fingertips, feeling the static of surface vibration. ''Don't do anything sudden,'' Mr. Haywood advises. The car slurs lazily left and right as it slips into the tracks left by a scout car in the broken playa. I shift into sixth gear at 150 m.p.h. The car surges like a spurred thoroughbred. Mr. Haywood says, ''Go -- all the way down.''</p>
        <p>The 911 Turbo has a top speed of 189 miles an hour, which can be a real time-saver if you happen to commute across an alkaline desert. At such extreme speeds, cars have a nasty tendency to behave like airplanes. The 911 Turbo has been painstakingly contoured by aerodynamic engineers to minimize high-speed lift. Spoilers and shaped underbody trays channel air from beneath the car, while an integrated rear wing deploys at speeds above 75 m.p.h. to provide a modicum of downforce.</p>
        <p>The car is ventilated with aggressive scoops and louvers designed to feed cooling air to the brakes, the radiators and the intercoolers of the turbochargers. This is the way German automotive engineering works: The Turbo can cruise at maximum speed all day long -- or at least until the 17-gallon fuel supply is exhausted.</p>
        <p>This is the first turbocharged version of the water-cooled 911 that made its debut as a 1999 model. (Previous models were air-cooled). Rather than turbocharge the standard engine, as was the practice in the past, Porsche domesticated the engine from its GT1 racecar that won Le Mans. This flat 6, which displaces 3.6 liters, is fitted with two high-pressure turbochargers and a complex system of variable valve timing. This system, called VarioCam Plus, combined with electronic throttle linkage and other exotic engine controls, has the effect of flattening the torque curve -- the graphic representation of power output plotted against engine speed -- so that the Turbo's maximum power of 413 foot-pounds of torque is available from around 2,500 r.p.m. to 4,500 r.p.m. In simple terms, the Turbo's raw force is instantly on tap in any gear and at almost any engine speed. This thing is a rocket.</p>
        <p>Porsche claims a 0-to-60 m.p.h. speed of 4.2 seconds for the 3,395-pound 911 Turbo. With the optional Tiptronic S transmission, that number rises to 4.9 seconds, not bad for a car with an automatic.</p>
        <p>The 911 Turbo is not the fastest car in America. The Ferrari 550 Maranello has been tested by Car and Driver magazine at 192 m.p.h. And the Lamborghini Diablo GT can exceed 202 m.p.h., according to Road &amp; Track magazine.</p>
        <p>It is perfectly reasonable to ask why any car needs to go so fast -- particularly in the United States, where the highest highway speed limits are around 75 m.p.h. Supercars like the 911 Turbo, the Maranello and the Diablo are so patently overpowered for street use that they seem not only indulgent, but fairly ridiculous.</p>
        <p>Yet, in the marketing of super-exotics, top speed has a logic all its own.</p>
        <p>''It's all about bragging rights,'' Mr. Haywood says. ''Nobody who buys a Lamborghini Diablo is going to go out and hit top speed. It's an abstraction, so people can say, 'Mine can go 200 m.p.h., and yours can't.' ''</p>
        <p>The 911 Turbo, based on the Porsche Carrera 4's all-wheel-drive platform, is one of the two or three best-handling cars on the planet. It is powerful yet serenely balanced, with no ugly surprises lurking anywhere. Grip from the extra-wide tires (8 inches in front, 11 inches in rear) allows the all-wheel-drive car to claw through corners at speeds that make most drivers pale with anxiety. In a day's driving through the Sierra Nevada, it required real courage to push the car anywhere near its limits.</p>
        <p>To get the stability management system to kick in, it was necessary to simply yank the wheel to see what happened. In that case, the car's computer rapidly re-established equilibrium by cycling the brakes on selected wheels and reducing engine power. The stability system then quickly returned control to the cockpit.</p>
        <p>It's too much to say the car is idiot-proof, but it's close.</p>
        <p>The 911 Turbo's other dynamics are what you'd expect from the top-line Porsche. The antilock brakes are ferociously strong, yet this fall Porsche will make available ceramic disc brakes that will be 50 percent lighter and even stronger than the current cast-iron discs. The power rack-and-pinion steering is as quick as a scorpion and even more precise.</p>
        <p>The Turbo's strut front suspension and multilink rear has been tuned to give back a little of the fishtailing liveliness that marked the old 911 Turbos. But in the new car, the tail stays planted.</p>
        <p>As the $111,000 standard-bearer for the Porsche line, the 911 Turbo comes with a full leather interior, 10-speaker sound system and power sunroof, among other things. On the options list, the Tiptronic S adds $3,420; heated seats $400; navigation system $3,540; and remote CD changer $705.</p>
        <p>The overall sensation of the car is one of brute force controlled by an intellect of a Zen master.</p>
        <p>One might quibble that Porsche has never really found the handle on luxury that brands like Ferrari and Aston-Martin have. The car's interior could feel a little richer -- though you can order custom paints and leathers, as well as wood or carbon-fiber trim for nearly every inch of the car's insides. But it's unlikely that such complaints will find much traction with Porsche's enthusiastic owner corps.</p>
        <p>The final timing marker, an orange traffic cone floating in the white void, winks in and out of view. My flying mile is over, and as I coast toward the braking area, I notice that I've had my jaw clenched all along. I look in the rear-view mirror and watch the contrail of alkaline dust settle behind me.</p>
        <p>''Nice job,'' Mr. Haywood says. I'm not sure if he is talking to me or the car.</p>
