        <p>Zura Uzuyeva was just cleaning up the dishes in the courtyard of her small brick home in the Oktyabrsky district of the Chechen capital last week when the staccato drone of a Russian attack helicopter bathed the neighborhood, the volume rising as it approached.</p>
        <p>''My wife had called us to dinner, and we had been sitting at the table, all four of us,'' said her husband, Shamsudin Uzuyev, a former high school principal and teacher of chemistry and biology. ''My sons and I then went inside, and she stayed there in the courtyard to wash. I had hardly opened the door when the missile struck.''</p>
        <p>From his crouched position, Mr. Uzuyev turned and through the smoke saw his wife lying motionless on the bricks in the shade of an apricot tree. Blood was flowing from her head wounds, caused by the blast, which also ripped a hole in the kitchen roof. Mrs. Uzuyeva died as her sons, Adam, 25, and Bislan, 21, both college students this fall, knelt beside her.</p>
        <p>Among the gaping hulks of half-destroyed buildings, skeletal roof lines and mounds of rubble of the Chechen capital, military violence is still part of the daily routine of the nearly 150,000 people who have returned to the city to live in poverty, deprivation and fear.</p>
        <p>A year after Russia's large-scale assault on rebellious Chechnya, and months after Moscow declared that the military phase of the ''counterterrorist'' operation had concluded, Grozny is trapped between war and peace: war that Russia cannot bring to conclusion and peace that cannot take hold until a new Chechen leadership emerges to tame or supplant the warlords and ''bandits'' whom Moscow is determined to crush.</p>
        <p>During a five-day visit, residents complained that they live in repressive conditions of undeclared martial law, subjected to random searches, arrests, extortion and intimidation at more than 100 checkpoints with gun emplacements, razor wire and barricades. About 7,000 Russian troops are stationed in the city, choking the movement of people and basic foodstuffs. To be on the street past the 9 p.m. curfew is a life-threatening risk -- of being shot by nervous Russian soldiers or caught in crossfire between Chechen rebels and Moscow's troops. Even ambulances are not allowed to operate at night.</p>
        <p>In the space of three days this month, 20 people died, 16 of them in a car bomb attack. Three Russian soldiers were gunned down in a street market while selling pilfered military gasoline to Chechen traders. And Mrs. Uzuyeva was felled by the helicopter assault on a civilian district where as many as 20,000 people are camped out in damaged and darkened homes.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 12, the Russian military command said federal checkpoints in Chechnya had come under fire 19 times in the previous 24 hours, with four soldiers killed. Twenty-nine Chechens were arrested in the same period on suspicion that they were rebels. Residents complain that young men suspected of collaboration with the rebels continue to disappear, others are beaten or ransomed back to their families. Many Chechens have sent appeals to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to lift the siege that continues here.</p>
        <p>''When a ship is sinking, it calls for help, sends out an S O S signal everywhere,'' wrote Luiza Timogova and 29 of her classmates at Grozny University to Mr. Putin this month. ''Apparently your circle is not letting you know the real truth about the situation in Chechnya, and the situation there is such that people are living in inhuman conditions, in conditions of persecution and tyranny.''</p>
        <p>There are also acts of humanity. Russian soldiers at one checkpoint took charge of five orphaned boys this fall and were feeding them army rations until Grozny's social welfare department found space for them at an orphanage.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of good people on both sides,'' said Tamara Magomadova, Grozny's director of social services.</p>
        <p>The Russian military commander in Grozny, Maj. Gen. Vasily V. Prizemlin, insists that harsh measures are necessary to prevent terrorist attacks, like the car bomb that exploded Oct. 13 outside a police station and the mine blast that injured four Russian soldiers in a convoy the next day.</p>
        <p>The missile attack that killed Mrs. Uzuyeva followed the mine attack on the convoy. Residents demanded an investigation, but city officials reported that the military prosecutor's office was dismissive of the request, saying the Oktyabrsky district was an ''uninhabited area.''</p>
        <p>Despite all the violence, Chechens are trickling back to Grozny. Deputy Mayor Saidali Umalatov said the population reached 165,000 this month, less than half the prewar level of 450,000, but more than the 90,000 to 100,000 estimated by some aid organizations. Last winter, during the peak of the Russian assault, it plummeted to 10,000.</p>
        <p>Moscow's handpicked Chechen leader, Akhmad Kadyrov, has just promised that the republic's government and ministries will move back to Grozny this month from temporary quarters in nearby Gudermes. A new mayor, Bislan Gantimirov, jailed for embezzling reconstruction funds after the 1994-96 Chechen war, was appointed by Moscow and vowed to fight ''terrorism'' and ''breathe life'' back into the city.</p>
        <p>It will be difficult even to find quarters for the government.</p>
        <p>Much of the city's population is living, as if in caves, within the damaged walls of apartments without heat, electricity or running water. There is no television or telephones, only candles, kerosene lamps and the trickle of gas that can barely boil water for tea.</p>
        <p>Under a pall of smoke from 39 burning oil wells, Grozny is living on promises: that more than the current dribble of humanitarian aid will come, that homes will be rebuilt and that food and shelter will be provided to allow 150,000 Chechens living in tents, garages and sheds in neighboring Ingushetia to return home.</p>
        <p>''The process of real restoration of the city has not yet started in any sense of the word,'' said Mr. Umalatov, who keeps a poster of Mr. Putin overlaid with the words, ''We will restore the Chechen Republic.''</p>
        <p>Every factory in the city, even the bakeries, have been flattened. Nearly 17,500 private homes and 700 buildings containing 20,000 apartments were destroyed by two cycles of war. But Mr. Umalatov asserted that 37,000 private homes and 49,000 apartments can be repaired and reinhabited.</p>
        <p>Medent Sultanova, a 48-year-old nurse, lives in an apartment that once had three rooms. Today, her sitting room opens onto a three-story cavern. A bomb sheared off the back of the building. At the other end of her dwelling, another cavern opens at the stairwell. She hangs her laundry in this cathedral of emptiness under a roof that keeps the rain off the rubble.</p>
        <p>''They promise they will rebuild Grozny,'' she said, ''but I don't think it will happen any time soon.''</p>
        <p>Reconstruction funding from Moscow has been frozen or deferred until next year with no explanation; many Chechens feel they are being punished because rebel attacks persist.</p>
        <p>''They try to portray all Chechens as bandits, but we are honest and decent people,'' said Adam Magomedov, a 23-year-old senior at the city's Petroleum Institute. ''If a person is tortured mentally and physically, he has no other choice but to take up arms and go to the mountains.''</p>
        <p>At Hospital No. 9, the only emergency medical facility operating, the chief physician, Ruslan Sharkhalov, said 90 percent of his patients were suffering from wounds caused by mine blasts, shell fragments and booby traps like the one 16-year-old Vaha Masarov tripped on when he was helping to reopen his school. Patients must bring their own food and bed linen. There is no infectious disease ward, and an outbreak of hepatitis at an orphanage last week forced the hospital to turn sick children away as nurses scrambled to find homes where each could be isolated.</p>
        <p>''All repairs and restoration have been stopped for lack of money, and we have had no salaries for five months,'' Dr. Sharkhalov said, pleading for aid to rebuild the roof of his infectious disease ward.</p>
        <p>Fatima Khasuyeva, 23, lost part of her right leg to shrapnel when Russian troops fired rockets into the city's central market on Oct. 21, 1999, killing nearly 100 people.</p>
        <p>''I was lying among the corpses,'' she said. ''Those who lived crawled away, and only the rebels picked us up and took us to the hospital.''</p>
        <p>Today Ms. Khasuyeva descends eight flights of stairs on crutches to reach the street, where she searches for medicines and bandages to treat her wound, which has refused to heal. She desperately needs an operation she cannot afford.</p>
        <p>''They wanted to amputate my leg three times, but I stopped them,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the darkened family apartment, her mother, Madina, wept. She has sold the family carpets and her earrings to pay a year's worth of medical costs. Her husband sells cigarettes in the market for food money. ''We have nothing left to sell,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Every morning, as autumn frost glistens on the foliage that is growing out of the detritus of war, mothers emerge from the rubble to escort schoolchildren with backpacks past mine fields and Russian machine gun posts to 40 schools that opened in September. Bus convoys collect college students from distant villages and drive them through checkpoints in hopes there will be more safety in numbers.</p>
        <p>''We could not bear to think that our children would lose another year of school, because so many years have already been lost in education,'' said Liza Barayeva, 32, who along with 10 other unpaid teachers reoccupied the school building known as Gymnasium No. 41. They cleaned one wing, stretching plastic sheeting donated from Poland over open window frames and digging textbooks out of the wrecked library that took a direct hit last winter.</p>
        <p>They registered 568 students where 1,600 once studied. ''There were many more who wanted to study, but we couldn't take more because of the conditions,'' Ms. Barayeva said.</p>
        <p>Timur T. Alarkhanov, a school engineer, added, ''We haven't been given a nail.''</p>
        <p>Students bring their own food. A brick outhouse stands on the playground because there is no indoor plumbing.</p>
        <p>In the physics class of Rosa Akhatuyeva, students have decorated notebooks with pictures of the Western pop singers Britney Spears and Ricky Martin and the Russian heartthrob Alsou. The teenage boys scrawl graffiti -- ''Long live Chechnya'' and ''Future rebel'' -- on the walls. After a month of classes, attendance has dropped to 400 as the crackdown on Grozny has tightened.</p>
        <p>Grozny University and two other higher education institutes are holding classes this fall, but they may be forced to close if promised heating systems do not arrive by winter.</p>
        <p>''Three-quarters of the university is destroyed,'' said Rector Adlan Khamzayev, a physicist. He wore an overcoat against the chill as artillery fire thundered outside his window. ''But we thought that the very fact of reopening would help serve as a kind of catalyst for the restoration of Grozny.''</p>
        <p>Some Russian leaders say Grozny should be abandoned. General Gennadi Troshev, who was born in Grozny and helped direct the assault on the city, has called it ''the site of an environmental catastrophe.''</p>
        <p>One hundred years of oil refining, Grozny's dominant industry, has flooded the water table with an estimated 500,000 tons of gasoline distillate that leaked from underground pipelines. It forms an underground lake of gasoline mixed with acetone, phenol and other toxins. This lake ''floats'' on the water table and stretches five miles underground from the refinery district through the center of the city. It is a mile wide.</p>
        <p>The onset of war and the destruction of the city's refinery complex has loosed a pirate industry of backyard wells, where sump pumps are lowered to skim the gasoline distillate off the top of the water table and refine it in homemade stills like moonshine. Low-grade gasoline is sold on every corner in Grozny.</p>
        <p>''The air is polluted, the water is polluted and everything that grows here and is eaten here is polluted by these chemicals,'' said Hassan I. Besanayev, the chief ecologist at the Grozneft oil company.</p>
        <p>He expressed indignation that foreigners had paid little attention to the environmental disaster, contrasting this with the concern over Kuwait's oil wells set afire in the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>''If such a dangerous ecological situation were taking shape in any former republic of the Soviet Union, and anywhere else in the world, people would be screaming, 'Save our souls,' '' he said.</p>
