        <p>FACING the television cameras, Jack Kemp, the former vice presidential candidate, sat proudly beside Jimmy Carter and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, ready to hail the 100,000th home built by Habitat for Humanity. It was a serene and dignified occasion, until Mr. Kemp's cell phone suddenly rang.</p>
        <p>''Jack, I know you can't talk right now, but you've got to listen to me,'' an excited voice said. Wesley Buford, chairman and chief executive of Freedom Card in Los Angeles, who had glimpsed Mr. Kemp on TV, jumped at the chance to turn his speech into a marketing moment. ''Tell them they qualify for a Freedom Card,'' Mr. Buford said.</p>
        <p>Though a bit taken aback, Mr. Kemp obliged, persuaded once again by the tireless entrepreneur who got him to invest in Freedom Card, the first nationwide African-American credit card company. ''It shows you the tenacity of this guy,'' Mr. Kemp said.</p>
        <p>Not to mention daring. While some entrepreneurs cringe at being associated with failure, Mr. Buford named his credit card company after the Freedom National Bank in Harlem, the minority-owned bank established by Jackie Robinson and other investors that was closed by regulators in 1990.</p>
        <p>Far from regarding the bank's legacy as ominous, Mr. Buford eagerly adopted its philosophy -- and some of its lending ideas -- to create one of the first credit cards marketed specifically to African-Americans, Latinos and other minorities nationwide. Within these groups, it hopes to attract borrowers with nonexistent or poor credit histories, who often have trouble qualifying for other cards.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of what happened, it is important to continue that mission,'' said Mr. Buford, whose cousin was the bank's president. ''The thing that has historically plagued these communities is the inability to formulate capital.''</p>
        <p>Only 42 percent of African-American and 51 percent of Latino households hold credit cards, compared with 67 percent of whites, according to Claritas, a marketing research firm in San Diego.  To chip away at those disparities, Mr. Buford's company formed a partnership six months ago with Cross Country Bank to issue the credit card, a MasterCard. They will not say how many they have issued, though they report 75,000 applications. The standard rate is about 21 percent, three percentage points above the national average --  hardly a deal, analysts say, but not uncommon for a card that accepts higher-risk borrowers.</p>
        <p>''The system is forgiving,'' said Mr. Buford, 51, the devout son, grandson and nephew of ministers. ''Every major industrial company and high-tech company has had its stumbles. The same courtesy we extend to them should be extended to the private citizen as well.''</p>
        <p>The risk is real, but the market is huge, allowing Mr. Buford to attract a roster of investors, ranging from John S. Chalsty, chairman of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, to Dr. Julienne Malveaux, a syndicated columnist. Most of them say they invested for one reason beyond the untapped opportunity: Mr. Buford himself.</p>
        <p>His resume reads like a random litany of African-American firsts. In 1978, while still in his 20's, Mr. Buford outbid a syndicate of Los Angeles businessmen to become the first African-American to own a major textile company in the United States, producing quilted fabrics for the military and the apparel and bedding industries.</p>
        <p>As a rising music promoter who booked concerts for the Spinners and Isaac Hayes, he already had some money, but nothing approaching the seven-figure sale price to which he committed himself in the heat of the bidding. To complete the deal, he had to raise the money in just 24 hours. He managed to borrow it from local banks and from Sam Schulman, the former owner of the Seattle Supersonics and an acquaintance from Mr. Buford's promoting days. Thus Mr. Buford bought the company, which had been his mother's employer for 25 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buford turned over the quilting company to his mother and left for Africa, where he became one of the first people to sell American hair care products. In 1985, he returned to start Pro Ball Food and Beverage, the first juice producer to license team logos from the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball and slap them on drink bottles.</p>
        <p>''I had no premeditation or thoughts about trying to be a pioneer or a first in anything,'' Mr. Buford said.</p>
        <p>In 1990, he teamed up with a motivational speaker named Montel Williams and helped him create his television talk show. To generate a buzz in each new market for the show, now seen in 95 percent of the country, the two canvassed churches, sidewalks and malls.</p>
        <p>''Wesley was extremely persistent,'' said Michael H. Gerber, former president of Viacom Enterprises, which distributed the program. ''If you don't have that kind of determination, don't get in the game.''</p>
        <p>There have been setbacks. Mr. Buford is still rankled by a failed attempt with Magic Johnson in 1994 to acquire KCAL, a Disney-owned station in Los Angeles, spoiling his plans for an Afrocentric television station.</p>
        <p>Still endowed with seemingly limitless self-confidence, Mr. Buford is quick to talk about his latest endeavor as an historic mission. ''To overcome the digital divide, we must first bridge the credit divide,'' Mr. Buford said. ''If I fail, there's nobody else.''</p>
        <p>Though he won't disclose his own wealth -- ''anyone who knows his net worth isn't worth very much,'' he said -- Mr. Buford plans to emulate his heroes, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, by giving to charity some of his company's fortune, once it starts making one.</p>
        <p>But don't look for Mr. Buford's company to become charitable anytime soon. As Mr. Kemp, who serves on Freedom Card's board, put it, ''You have to make a profit before you can be philanthropic.''</p>
