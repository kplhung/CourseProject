        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is not surprising that consulting firms are reaching beyond business graduates in their hiring (''A Matter of Degree? Not for Consultants,'' Oct. 1).</p>
        <p>In the last decade, the number of consultants from leading firms has more than doubled, while the number of graduates from the leading business schools has grown only marginally. Economics, law and allied disciplines use problem-solving methods closely related to business and represent a pool of high intellect.</p>
        <p>But consulting is more than sheer intellect and access to data and  precedent. Our competitive environment demands the ability to see patterns, to discern the difference between symptom and root cause, and to navigate minefields of political and personal agendas. M.B.A. education provides both a body of knowledge in fields exploding onto the business scene and experience in viewing problems from multiple perspectives. Classes consider trade-offs between present and future and the  hard and soft sciences. They can also hone team analysis and communication skills. While lifetime learning is a given, these competencies form a base for professional growth.</p>
        <p>Consulting firms are able to hire nonbusiness students in part because of mentoring by business-educated partners and senior staff. As these new consultants advance, substance, perspective and depth of vision will  become ever more important. Perhaps that is why increasing numbers of people with Ph.D.'s and other degrees are returning for M.B.A.'s, often with consulting careers in mind.</p>
