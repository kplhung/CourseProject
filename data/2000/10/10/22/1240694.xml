        <p>When, in his 1924 manifesto, the French poet Andre Breton defined the term Surrealisme as ''pure psychic automatism,'' he established the framework for literary and visual art that expressed the spirit of the period between the two world wars. Building on groundwork laid by Dada's absurdist nihilism, Breton and the artists and writers of his circle embraced randomness, reverie and other nonrational sources of imagery. But the iconoclasm that was initially shocking and then increasingly prescient ultimately generated its own orthodoxy. As Barbara Lekatsas of Hofstra University remarks in her brief but valuable essay in the exhibition's catalog: ''We have come to recognize a canon based on a philosophy of reality and an aesthetics that proved to be capable of imitation and repetition. The challenge of course is always to imitate the process, not the product.'' If only the artists in this show had risen to that challenge.</p>

        <p>'Surrealism'  Nassau County Museum of Art, One Museum Drive, Roslyn Harbor. Through Jan. 14. (516) 484-9337. www.nassaumuseum.org.</p>
        <p>When, in his 1924 manifesto, the French poet Andre Breton defined the term Surrealisme as ''pure psychic automatism,'' he established the framework for literary and visual art that expressed the spirit of the period between the two world wars. Building on groundwork laid by Dada's absurdist nihilism, Breton and the artists and writers of his circle embraced randomness, reverie and other nonrational sources of imagery. But the iconoclasm that was initially shocking and then increasingly prescient ultimately generated its own orthodoxy. As Barbara Lekatsas of Hofstra University remarks in her brief but valuable essay in the exhibition's catalog: ''We have come to recognize a canon based on a philosophy of reality and an aesthetics that proved to be capable of imitation and repetition. The challenge of course is always to imitate the process, not the product.'' If only the artists in this show had risen to that challenge.</p>
        <p>The problem is not so much that others imitated the Surrealists, but that they imitated themselves, as this selection amply illustrates.  There is nothing spontaneous in Giorgio de Chirico's endless recyclings of the haunting pre-World War I streetscapes that made him a Surrealist avatar, or unpremeditated in Salvador Dali's grotesques, except insofar as he was merely going through the motions of creativity.  When automatism became automatic pilot, as it did also for Joan Miro, Paul Delvaux, Man Ray, Matta and other early Surrealists who labored on through the 1950's, 1960's and beyond, the result is either illustrative or decorative. Exceptions include Wifredo Lam, whose imagery was always closer to magical than surreal; Alberto Giacometti, who evolved a highly personal reductivism out of Surrealism's obsession with mutilation; and Rene Magritte, whose timeless perceptual conundrums transcend period and style.</p>
        <p>Nonsensical by nature, Surrealist art benefits from a contextual setting that is lacking here, although jumbling everything together often provides telling contrasts between prime examples and pale imitations.  Among the most interesting exhibits are the documents, on loan from Hofstra's Weingrow Collection, but no effort has been made to relate them to the surrounding artworks.  The selection of jewelry and accessories, including period pieces and other more recent examples, shows how readily Surrealism was co-opted by fashion but does not explore the broader implications of related imagery in the art.</p>
        <p>Shortcomings aside, the exhibition contains some remarkable pieces, especially those from Surrealism's early days and during World War II, when the artists' most nightmarish visions became reality. Among the gems of that era are Max Ernst's tiny but chilling ''Barbarians,'' a 1937 oil, a premonition of bestial combat; an Oscar Dominguez oil of 1939, ''The Flying Saucers,'' that looks like an early warning system for the Holocaust; Andre Masson's monstrous 1943 ''Constellation II,'' a black hole that devours the heavens; Matta's two miasmic canvases from the early 1940's, before he became a science-fiction cartoonist; and Delvaux's ''The Ancient City,'' its populace shocked and disoriented like Europe in 1941,the year it was painted.</p>
        <p>'Avant Garde'</p>
        <p>Gallery Rood, 417 Main Street, Eastport. Through Nov. 5. (631) 325-7929.</p>
        <p>Like Surrealism, the New York School had its formative phase, its classic period and its decline into repetition and imitation. Yet many of the abstract artists who came to prominence in the 1950's continued to reinvent themselves fruitfully during the ensuing decades down to the present. The current exhibition, ''Avant Garde of the Fifties and Now,'' the first at this new gallery, is devoted to making that point. There are some beautiful drawings, paintings and sculptures to prove that, if this particular garde is no longer avant, neither is it retardataire.</p>
        <p>The selection is a bit haphazard, with some artists represented by only one piece rather than something early and something late, and a few of the putative ''now'' examples, like Jimmy Ernst's captivating web-like untitled oil of 1967, are actually closer to ''then.'' Of course it would be impossible to represent Ernst with a recent work, since he died in 1984, so the show's premise is a trifle misleading. But such lapses are balanced by examples like Joe Stefanelli's wonderfully murky ''Early Cedar,'' a 1950 homage to the artist's favorite watering hole, the Cedar Bar, paired with a painting done this year to prove that Mr. Stefanelli is still vigorous and inventive half a century later.</p>
        <p>An excellent illustration of evolution in color treatment is Herman Cherry's ''Blue Surge,'' a mid-1980's oil that vibrates with translucent layering, while in ''Aggression,'' a 1959 oil on paper, color is subordinated to the artist's signature brushwork. A refinement in gestural technique characterizes Raymond Hendler's development from the heavy impasto and tonal graduation of his numbered 1950's oils to the schematic character of ''Port of Call,'' a mid-1980's canvas that exploits the crispness of acrylic without sacrificing painterly energy.</p>
        <p>There are also some remarkably consistent artists represented here, like Fred Mitchell, whose 1955 ''Landscape Meridionde,'' while more staccato than his ''Ocean,'' painted this year, exhibits the same palette and rhythmic vitality. Another is Mary Abbott, whose 1985 ''Red Still Life'' nicely complements its companion piece, ''Mahogany Road,'' an oil on paper from some 30 years earlier. The sculptor Ibram Lassaw, although represented by an early drawing and a recent welded metal piece, also demonstrates that the pursuit of a single-minded aesthetic does not necessarily lead to creative stagnation.</p>
