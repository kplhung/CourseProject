        <p>WHAT had been 13 acres of corn to feed a small herd of cattle has became a labyrinthine affair for those seeking a navigational challenge and willing to pay a $5 entry fee for it.</p>
        <p>''Other farmers probably thought I'd gone off the deep,'' said Allen Cockerline, who created the maze in his Falls Village cornfield, ''but I thought it would be fun and a way to make the crop pay back while it's still in the ground.''</p>
        <p>The challenge of the maze is to locate the patches of other crops -- sorghum, winter rye, sunflowers, and oats -- that Mr. Cockerline has planted within.</p>
        <p>The maze, at the juncture of Routes 7 and 112, is open on weekends from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. through the end of the month.</p>
