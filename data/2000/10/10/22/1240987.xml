        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am amazed that a three-week crash course, in this case in business, can be considered the equivalent of a two-year M.B.A. It seems that I wasted much of my post-undergraduate life attaining two master's degrees and undertaking rigorous doctoral study, when all I had to do was take a few brief classes. Foolish me!</p>

        <p>While we're at it, why don't we just abolish the four-year requirement of medical school and replace it with a three-week course? After all, isn't that enough time to master cardiology?</p>
