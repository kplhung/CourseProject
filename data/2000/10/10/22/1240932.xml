        <p>JUST below the Eleanor Roosevelt statue at the West 72d Street entrance to Riverside Park is a 16,000-square-foot space that might be the city's best-kept networking secret. In the dog-meet-dog world of ''petworking,'' people can look for work as they walk their pets.</p>
        <p>''We're overrun by actors, TV directors, journalists, architects, C.F.O.'s, realtors, surgeons, shrinks, flacks, day traders, litigators, legislators and techies,'' said F. Peter Model, a freelance writer and editor and the ''father'' of poodles Chloe and Oliver, about the dog run there. ''There's Conan O'Brien, Al Franken and Elayne Boosler, but it's mostly people who know other people who know other people who know of an opening or an opportunity.''</p>

        <p>JUST below the Eleanor Roosevelt statue at the West 72d Street entrance to Riverside Park is a 16,000-square-foot space that might be the city's best-kept networking secret. In the dog-meet-dog world of ''petworking,'' people can look for work as they walk their pets.</p>
        <p>''We're overrun by actors, TV directors, journalists, architects, C.F.O.'s, realtors, surgeons, shrinks, flacks, day traders, litigators, legislators and techies,'' said F. Peter Model, a freelance writer and editor and the ''father'' of poodles Chloe and Oliver, about the dog run there. ''There's Conan O'Brien, Al Franken and Elayne Boosler, but it's mostly people who know other people who know other people who know of an opening or an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>As at other dog-gathering spots in the city, the owners arrive here in the morning in waves, some bearing the papers and thermos mugs of coffee and chomping on Krispy Kreme doughnuts, the one thing they refuse to share with their dogs.  The canine rush hour runs from dawn until 8:30 a.m. and picks up again after work. On weekends the crowd arrives later, from as far away as Central Park West.</p>
        <p>At all these times, leads about jobs are frequently  shared along with the dog biscuits. Sometimes, the most sought-after items aren't plastic bags but pens and scraps of paper for jotting down names, e-mail addresses and other information about employment.</p>
        <p>Even if celebrity hounding is out of bounds at the 72nd Street spot, ''job hunting is cool,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Zahn, an anesthesiologist and founder of Friends and Lovers of Riverside Area Life (Floral), a volunteer group that last year lobbied the Parks Department to create this, the largest of the city's 35 runs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Model, who ghostwrites historical and other nonfiction books, himself landed an assignment writing the biography of a real estate developer while at the park, he said. Last year, he also helped  one job-seeking dog owner to secure a position with Mr. Model's wife, Alyne, a commercial real estate broker who was looking for an assistant.</p>
        <p>In other words, while upwardly mobile New Yorkers are surfing Internet job boards and paying top dollar for resume services, some excellent leads may be at the end of the leash. From one angle, petworking is no surprise: it unites two of the city's passions, pets and good jobs. Still, while walking the dog may be an old stratagem in the search for romance, it is not, or not yet, a feature of career guides.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the atmosphere at dog runs -- the list of city runs can be found at www.urbanhound.com and other sites -- is a little unorthodox. Mr. Model calls it ''an open-air caffeine cocktail party where all the guests are dressed for latrine duty.''</p>
        <p>Sarah Firisen, 31, a freelance Internet programmer who frequents the dog scene in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, points out another difference between petworking and networking. ''You tend to know people by the names of their dogs, i.e., Mr. and Mrs. Lulu or Mr. Ringo,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Why does petworking work?</p>
        <p>''Dogs are social creatures and thus they force social interaction,'' said Bash Dibra, an animal behaviorist and the author of ''Dogspeak'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999), a book about communicating with your pet.  ''Humans are social creatures, but they often need prompting. So the dog acts as a catalyst in breaking down barriers and opening communication. The first remark is always about the dog. Then maybe the next comment is, 'I had a really bad day and I think I need to look for a new job.' ''</p>
        <p>Shared discomfort may play a role, too. One reason the military puts recruits  through basic training is that collective exposure to hardship builds camaraderie. While Fort Dix may be nothing like the local dog run, standing around in the pouring rain and tossing mud-caked toys can have the same effect.</p>
        <p>''You'd have to be nuts to do this three times a day,'' said Mary-Ellen Buttner, a graphic designer and owner of Nape, a yellow Labrador that she takes to Riverside. ''It's running into all the other dog owners that makes it all worthwhile.''</p>
        <p>Of the city's other large doggy spots -- Washington Square Park in the Village and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, for example -- Prospect Park may have the hottest petworking scene. That's where, two years ago, Ms. Firisen first encountered Lawrence Quigley, a Web graphics designer.</p>
        <p>As her golden retriever, Molly, frolicked with his German shepherdish mutt, Ringo, Mr. Quigley mentioned that he was starting to freelance. Ms. Firisen offered him work on a project creating a Web site for the Montauk Club, a 109-year-old club housed in a Venetian-style mansion in nearby Park Slope. They've since teamed up on all Ms. Firisen's projects -- she has created a Web site for a veterinarian, and is now working on one for a children's clothing venture -- and become friends as well.</p>
        <p>Another Prospect Park regular, Melissa Truitt, who is a Pilates instructor and a personal trainer at Body Tonic Studio in Park Slope, has watched her client list expand on her walks with her golden retriever, Amber. Ms. Truitt said she has picked up at least 10 clients and even more referrals.</p>
        <p>''Before 9 in the morning, the dogs go off leash and people stand around with their coffee talking away, and eventually you find out what everyone does,'' Ms. Truitt said.</p>
        <p>The dog scene can be a social beehive, which may explain why petworking works so well. Louise Bernikow, a journalist who lives on the Upper West Side, describes the Riverside Park canine jungle in ''Bark if You Love Me'' (Algonquin Books, 2000), a tale of how adopting an abandoned boxer opened up a whole new social world to her.</p>
        <p>''There were cliques among the dog people in the park,'' she wrote. ''And cliques among the dogs.</p>
        <p>''There were dogs that didn't get along and people who didn't get along, unrelated to how the canines felt. There were grudges going back years, usually involving stolen toys or balls and perceived slights. The dogs operated on instinct. So did the people, but they made up reasons.''</p>
        <p>Amid the alliances, resentments and rationalizations, Ms. Bernikow notes, was an activity that is central to job-seeking: information-reaping. ''Like women at the water well in some ancient village,'' she wrote, ''we shared information.''</p>
        <p>Some dog owners go to the park not to find work but workers. In the mid-90's, Doug Feinstein, an advertising copywriter, found a baby sitter for his daughter, Emma, at the West 72nd Street dog run. The sitter, who worked for the family for a couple of years, was Isabel Kimmel, then a dancer with the New York City Ballet. She happened to own a West Highland white terrier,  just as Mr. Feinstein did.</p>
        <p>A few years later, when Emma was ready for piano lessons, Mr. Feinstein approached Maria Garcia, another 72nd Street regular, and said: ''I hear you're a pianist. Do you also teach children?'' She did.</p>
        <p>Such tales may prompt others to hunt jobs among the dogs. Dozier Lester, a Louisianan, married a West 72nd Street resident last January. Their two ''stepdogs'' bonded well, but there was a hitch. Although he still owns it, Mr. Lester could not bring his Louisiana telephone business to New York.</p>
        <p>For months, he tarried in the dog run as others went to work, his depression mounting, until this summer he began petworking in earnest, looking for a job in technology and using his Hungarian hound, Viszla, as his go-between. Since then he has had numerous job meetings with various prospects.</p>
        <p>''One deal I'm waiting on looks real good,'' Mr. Lester drawled. ''And I owe it all to my dawg.''</p>
        <p>For people in dog-related livelihoods, dog runs can be gold mines. Terri Goodwillie owns two Italian greyhounds, and two years ago, unable to find any clothes for them because of their unusual build, she whipped up some fitted fleece bodysuits.</p>
        <p>Before long, Ms. Goodwillie was approached by a dachshund owner, who was having trouble finding pet clothes. Soon, Ms. Goodwillie's pet-clothing business, Houndz in the 'Hood, www.houndzinthehood.com, was born. She caters to hard-to-fit animals -- she just returned from working the twice-yearly gathering of dachshunds and owners in Washington Square Park -- and sells her wares at various Manhattan shops, including the New York Dog Spa and Hotel in Chelsea and the Barking Zoo in TriBeCa.</p>
        <p>Beyond jobs, petworking can yield other practical connections, from leads on apartments to medical referrals. Mr. Model, for one, got some stock tips from one dog owner,  the same person he helped to land a job with his wife, the real estate broker.</p>
        <p>Penny Simon, a partner in Ray &amp; Berndtson, a search firm, said petworking in the broad sense fits the times.</p>
        <p>''People are changing jobs and careers so fast that they are looking at every aspect of their lives, from picking their 4-year-old's preschool to trying to get their 10-year-old  on the right baseball team, as a networking opportunity,'' she said. ''So why shouldn't walking your dog be next?''</p>
        <p>After all, she added: ''It's one of the oldest ways young men and women pick each other up in the city. Why not leverage a winning formula?''</p>
        <p>But don't forget who really makes petworking work: the dogs.</p>
        <p>Suzy Benzinger won't forget. A Broadway costume designer who has worked on ''Miss Saigon'' and ''Saturday Night Fever,'' Ms. Benzinger travels often and hires a lot of pet sitters for her dog, Moxie. After one trip, she came home to a surprise.</p>
        <p>''Countless people on my street were calling out Moxie's name, talking to her and stroking her in a very familiar way,'' Ms. Benzinger said. ''One woman asked if I was the new dog walker, and commented that Moxie really seemed to like me.''</p>
        <p>Others, she said, ''just gave me suspicious looks as if I was a dognapper.'' During that first week at home, Ms. Benzinger said, she talked to more people than she had in eight years of walking Moxie herself.</p>
        <p>''Apparently,'' Ms. Benzinger said, ''Moxie is much more social without me.''</p>
