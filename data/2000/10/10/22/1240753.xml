        <p>THINK organic food stores and what comes to mind?</p>
        <p>A funky space crowded with mystery mushrooms, tofu and possibly good-for-you but bruised organic fruits and vegetables, with the whole presided over by a sandal-clad proprietor wearing the human equivalent of a burlap bag?</p>
        <p>Harold Hochberger wanted people to think again about what a health food store could be.</p>
        <p>So when he started Mrs. Green's Natural Market in a strip mall on Central Avenue in Scarsdale in 1990, it was clear that this wasn't going to be your hippie cousin's kind of hangout.</p>
        <p>The organic produce, whether glistening ruby radishes, crisp-looking green apples or Yukon gold potatoes, are organized in their own well-defined sections. The aisles are stocked with all kinds of herbal teas, whole-grain cereals, soy products, rice-based low-fat sour cream and tofu cheeses as well as organic cheeses.</p>
        <p>But there are also aisles with organic tortilla chips, pasta sauces, salad dressings, breads, pound cakes and cookies and an in-house deli, which features stuffed grape leaves, sesame noodles, grilled chicken breasts, vegetarian wrap sandwiches and fruit-juice smoothies.</p>
        <p>Nearly the entire back wall is stocked with herbal remedies and vitamins, and customers can even find natural cosmetics, skin-care products and shampoos and  organic pet food.</p>
        <p>''He saw health food stores in the city, and there was nothing in Westchester,'' said Mr. Hochberger's wife, June, the president of Mrs. Green's, which has grown into a 10-store chain. ''He wanted to dispel the myth of health food stores as some kind of dirty, hippie-dippie kind of place.</p>
        <p>''So Harold found beautiful organic produce and healthy products for the whole family, not just people who were into health food. In the beginning, he had to throw out a lot of the produce because he only wanted to sell the beautiful and fresh organic produce, but we have high turnover now.''</p>
        <p>And why call the store Mrs. Green's? The name, Mrs. Hochberger said, ''was healthy and wholesome, suggesting a green way of life.''</p>
        <p>From the initial 3,000-square-foot store on Central Avenue, the Hochbergers expanded to a second location in Scarsdale along Route 22. Since 1997, when Mrs. Hochberger joined the company, it has added stores in Katonah, Larchmont, Mount Kisco, Mahopac, Suffern, Yorktown Heights and, in Fairfield and Stamford, Conn. The company has 300 employees.</p>
        <p>''The good part is that a Mrs. Green's can fit into any strip mall,'' said Mrs. Hochberger, who lives with her husband and three children in White Plains. ''Our stores can work in 2,000 to 10,000 square feet. Any town could use a Mrs. Green's.''  To Mrs. Hochberger, who has a master's degree from Columbia University and has spent more than 20 years in retailing, the Mrs. Green's concept was a natural fit for the county and its residents, who were health conscious and concerned about nutrition.</p>
        <p>''Who would knowingly want to give chemicals and pesticides to their family?'' said Mrs. Hochberger, who declined to release the company's sales revenues but said profit margins are higher than those for conventional supermarkets.</p>
        <p>For Lesley Gold, a nursery school teacher from Hartsdale who has been a customer for seven years, the produce is a definite draw. ''Mrs. Green's has a tremendous selection of organic foods,'' Mrs. Gold, a mother of two, said. ''The produce is really good. The less pesticides and insecticides on the fruits and vegetables the children eat, the better. It's healthier for them.''</p>
        <p>The store managers try to accommodate customer requests, no matter how specific: during Passover, for example, Mrs. Green's obtains spelt and oat bran matzohs for customers with wheat allergies. The Web site for Mrs. Green's is www.mrsgreens.com.</p>
        <p>''This is a feel-good business,'' Mrs. Hochberger said. ''Harold is proud of what he built, and we feel good about doing this every day.''</p>
