        <p>THE BRIDEGROOM</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By Ha Jin.</p>
        <p>225 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Pantheon Books. $22.</p>
        <p>A year ago, few were aware of the spare, resonant fiction of Ha Jin, a Chinese writer who has made his home in the United States since 1985 and who writes in English. But ''Waiting'' (1999), his second novel, brought him to the attention of a far broader readership. The winner of a National Book Award and the PEN/ Faulkner Award, ''Waiting'' tells the story of Lin Kong, a doctor in a provincial Chinese town named Muji City, and of the agonizing love triangle of which he is a part for 18 years. Back in his home village, Lin Kong has a wife whose bound feet are the sign of her backwardness, but whose devotion is unflagging, while in Muji he keeps company with an educated nurse named Manna Wu. The novel illuminates universal human emotions in an unfamiliar society, and Jin's use of detail -- sparse, precise, surprising -- brings Lin Kong's world thrillingly to life.</p>
        <p>The 12 stories in Jin's new collection, ''The Bridegroom,'' are also set in Muji City. They span China's movement toward capitalism, and lay bare the ironies of tyranny in all its forms. In the first story, ''Saboteur,'' a man named Mr. Chiu and his bride are dining calmly at the Muji train station, at the end of their honeymoon, when a malicious policeman provokes Chiu and then imprisons him for sport. Incredulous, Chiu is also helpless, and can eventually secure his release only by signing the self-criticism presented him by the authorities. He secures his revenge in a devious but devastating way. In the final story, ''After Cowboy Chicken Came to Town,'' the common man's enemy looks quite different. The story's narrator, Hongwen, is a young employee at Cowboy Chicken, dressed in the requisite McDonald's-style uniform, and while he is frustrated by the job, he's pleased to take home more money than his father. But when Hongwen and his colleagues discover that their American boss pays his American-educated Chinese manager vast sums in American dollars, their sense of justice is outraged. In keeping with capitalist principles as they understand them, the group goes on strike, only to lose their jobs. The face of tyranny may have changed, but in Jin's provincial China, characters remain subject to the arbitrary and vicious blows of power.</p>
        <p>These two stories, like several in the collection, are almost fabular in their construction. Their lessons are clear. Laced with black humor, they refrain from entering fully into the human complexities of their characters: unjust power structures, rather than the individual experiences of his protagonists, are the focus of these tales. Other pieces, including the book's title story, are more Chekhovian, less concerned with what happens and more concerned with the characters' experience of what happens.</p>
        <p>Cheng, the narrator of ''The Bridegroom,'' is worried about the welfare of his ward, a dear friend's daughter named Beina. Surprisingly to Cheng, he has succeeded in marrying her to Huang Baowen, one of the most eligible bachelors in the factory where they work: ''Did he really like her fleshy face, which often reminded me of a blowfish?'' Cheng wonders. But Baowen provides the necessary displays of intent (and Jin provides an example of his simple but glorious gift for detail): ''He came to my home with two trussed-up capons, four cartons of Ginseng cigarettes, two bottles of Five Grains' Sap and one tall tin of oolong tea. I was pleased, though not very impressed by his gifts.'' Worried that Baowen's eyes will wander to other, more attractive young women in the factory, Cheng is taken aback to discover that his son-in-law has instead been arrested for his participation in ''a club called Men's World, a salon of sorts'' -- in short, for homosexual activity.</p>
        <p>Consigned to a mental institution and to a regimen of mild electroshock therapy, Baowen seems to accept his fate with equanimity, and Beina remains loyal to him. Cheng attempts to help the younger man for Beina's sake; but when it is revealed that Baowen has been sleeping with a male nurse in the institution, and when Beina insists on sticking by her husband, Cheng washes his hands of the whole affair. The story does not provide tidy resolutions: rather, Jin evokes not only the subtleties of Cheng's reactions to both Baowen and Beina, but also Beina's poignant but all too human insistence upon her husband's honor. ''The Bridegroom'' is a fine story indeed, richer and more memorable than some of the others in this collection.</p>
        <p>It is not the only story in which Jin tackles psychological complexity; but in narratives like ''Flame'' and the epistolary ''An Official Reply,'' people relate to one another primarily through institutional structures, rather than as human beings. In ''Flame,'' Nimei hears from an old love that he is coming to visit: realizing that he has become an important official, she engages in complex machinations at work in the hope of securing a promotion for her husband in order to impress her ex. In ''An Official Reply,'' an academic named Zhao Ningshen gives a lengthy report about his former professor, Fang Baichen, who is now a subordinate, revealing not only the facts of Fang's career, but also his own unacknowledged ambitions and jealousies. The emotions of these characters are familiar, but their origins -- the pervasive hierarchical bureaucracy that defines the characters' lives -- are engagingly novel to an American sensibility.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that part of the pleasure of this collection, as in ''Waiting,'' lies in its revelation of an unknown world. Unlike many Chinese-American writers, Ha Jin does not shape his vision to be particularly accessible to an American audience: he is a Chinese writer, writing about China, who happens to live in the United States. What is perhaps more complicated, then, is his choice to write in English. Few foreign writers have successfully taken on the English language in adulthood, and those who spring to mind -- Conrad, Nabokov -- are supreme stylists, whose conversion implied a willed mastery.</p>
        <p>Ha Jin, on the other hand, writes spare prose, with a limited vocabulary: his works read as if he had written them in Chinese and merely undertaken the translations himself. For example, in ''Alive,'' Tong Guhan has been sent to claim a debt from a coal mine, which the manager proposes to pay in kind: ''This was absolutely unacceptable to Guhan. The cannery didn't need so much anthracite. Besides, how could they transport the coal to Muji? Railroad wagons, rationed by the state, were unavailable. Even if they managed to ship the coal back, there would be no place in the cannery to store the 600 tons. So, Guhan resolutely refused the offer.''</p>
        <p>And in ''In the Kindergarten'' we read: ''The teacher smacked her lips. Her sunburned nose crinkled, a faint smile playing on her face.'' The diction in both instances -- absolutely unacceptable''; ''resolutely refused''; ''smacked her lips,'' the ''crinkled'' nose, the ''playing'' smile -- is emphatically ordinary, even cliched. And the phrasing -- So, Guhan resolutely refused'' -- is un-English, a translated rhythm.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to escape the impression that for Ha Jin, the English language -- potentially so pliable, so complex -- is ultimately an unwieldy tool that merely suffices for his purposes. His literary vision, like his subjects thus far, is Chinese, and the English language not his calling but his arbitrary fate. But his eye for detail, his great storytelling talent -- these universal gifts suffuse his work and make ''The Bridegroom'' a genuine pleasure.</p>
