        <p>Editorial urges US Congress to revive hate-crimes bill that covered sex, disability or sexual orientation that Republican Congressional leaders killed; also urges action to correct major injustice Congress committed four years ago when it adopted harsh deportation rules; says hundreds of productive immigrants, longtime legal residents, have been automatically deported because of low-level offenses committed long ago (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Earlier this month, in a shameful bow to anti-gay voices within their party, Republican Congressional leaders killed hate-crimes legislation that had strong bipartisan support in the House and Senate. It remains to be seen whether hard bargaining by President Clinton over pending budget bills can help persuade the Republicans to revive the measure.</p>
        <p>But it is definitely a fight worth making. The legislation would strengthen the existing federal hate-crimes statute by authorizing for the first time the federal prosecution of crimes motivated by the victims' sex, disability or sexual orientation. It would also enhance the federal government's ability to prosecute violent crimes motivated by the victims' race, religion or national origin and its ability to help local authorities investigate and prosecute such crimes.</p>
        <p>Two years after the murder of young Matthew Shepard awakened the nation to the high incidence of hate crimes against gay people, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert need to consider the awful message they would send by ending the session without enacting this overdue legal protection.</p>

        <p>Last-minute action is also needed to correct a major injustice Congress committed four years ago when it adopted harsh deportation rules. Hundreds of productive immigrants, longtime legal residents, have been automatically deported because of low-level offenses committed long ago.</p>
        <p>A bipartisan measure recently approved by the House, while not the whole solution, would at least offer relief for many of those unfairly hurt by Congress's rash crackdown. Specifically, it would restore judicial discretion and due-process rights in those cases where the crime for which the person has been deported, or faces deportation, was committed before the passage of the 1996 law.</p>
        <p>It now rests with Republican leaders to make sure that the measure becomes law.</p>
