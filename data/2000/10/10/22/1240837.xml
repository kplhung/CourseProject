        <p>The state's core curriculum suggests that loss and grief be considered in a section on health and fitness. Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington  takes the suggestion to heart and requires that every senior attend a 90-minute workshop on death, loss and grief. Joe Rampulla, a school counselor, recently spoke of the workshop he runs.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you come to teach this?</p>
        <p>A. In addition to being a school counselor, I'm also a certified addictions  counselor. When I was working with that population, I noticed that a lot of  those clients had unresolved loss issues in their childhood -- that they were medicating themselves to keep the pain down. And I have also had to work through losses. My brother died when he was 35. My father died a  year and a half later, and my mother died a few years after that. So I came to understand that you have to deal with a loss on the feeling level right away. It happened that when I first started working as a school counselor at Hunterdon Central five years ago, five or six members of the staff had just lost someone. I just went to the principal and asked if I could I do a workshop for the staff on death and dying, and then I started the workshop for the students soon after.</p>
        <p>Q. Who have the students lost?</p>
        <p>A. Grandparents. Some have had friends who have died in car accidents. A handful have had parents who died. But it doesn't have to be about death. I'm dealing with other kinds of losses like divorce. That's a death, the death of a family.</p>
        <p>Q. What do you do in your workshops?</p>
        <p>A. It varies. We may do a time line where students chart the losses they've experienced. We generally use a ''feel wheel,'' which lists many of the emotions we feel. I also teach students about the stages of the grieving process, and the myths that surround grieving like, ''you should bury your feelings'' or ''you should grieve alone.'' Sometimes I have them write a letter to someone they have lost.</p>
        <p>I ask for a show of hands of any  students who have had losses in the  last five years. I ask them, ''We're you dating somebody and you broke up? Did your mom and dad go through a divorce? Did you have a death of a friend or relative, or was there a big sporting event which your team lost?'' Usually 99 percent of the hands go up, and that's where I do the feelings section.</p>
        <p>Q. Do students talk about the people they have lost?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, they do talk about them. Some will have to step out for a while, and their teacher is there to go out with them, and I've met with them in the counseling office later.  They don't have to talk about anything they don't want to. That is their right. But mostly they do.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you end the workshop?</p>
        <p>A. Sometimes I'll bring in a recording of a song that deals with loss like, ''The Living Years'' by the group Mike and the Mechanics about a father's death. Or we may watch a clip from a movie like ''The Dead Poets Society'' or ''Steel Magnolias'' where a character dies. I ask the students to use what they have learned in the workshop to analyze how a character in a song or movie handles their loss.</p>
        <p>Q. Is it hard for you to deal with all this loss?</p>
        <p>A. My spiritual side gives me comfort and strength. I'll ask God to be there when I'm counseling. I still feel sadness when students are sharing a story about someone who has died. But I have also learned in my counseling training that I don't have the right to take their sadness and make it mine. Years ago, I used to do that. I was like a sponge. But it's theirs and they have a right to their sadness.</p>
