        <p>LIKE many war veterans, Tracy Sugarman couldn't talk about his combat experience in World War II when he got home. But Mr. Sugarman, who had participated in the invasion of Omaha Beach as a naval ensign, had recorded his impressions of battle in letters and drawings that he sent home to his wife, June. Now those words and images have been put together in a book called ''My War,''  published by Random House.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't talk about it,'' said Mr. Sugarman of the war, ''When my kids read 'My War,' they said, 'You never told us'.''</p>

        <p>LIKE many war veterans, Tracy Sugarman couldn't talk about his combat experience in World War II when he got home. But Mr. Sugarman, who had participated in the invasion of Omaha Beach as a naval ensign, had recorded his impressions of battle in letters and drawings that he sent home to his wife, June. Now those words and images have been put together in a book called ''My War,''  published by Random House.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't talk about it,'' said Mr. Sugarman of the war, ''When my kids read 'My War,' they said, 'You never told us'.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't even know I still had those letters,'' said Mr. Sugarman, a 79-year-old Westport resident, who has worked as an illustrator for magazines, books and television. ''Then, in 1994, June read an article in the Times'' about the 50th anniversary of the Normandy Invasion. I said I wondered what happened to those letters. She said they were stored in boxes in the basement. We went downstairs and there they all were. June was very organized.''</p>
        <p>They were in mint condition too, including the precise watercolors and the finely detailed pen-and-ink drawings that captured boredom, fear and courage of his fellow sailors. Mr. Sugarman's letters are essentially love letters to his young wife. ''My War,'' in fact is a labor of love done in the memory of June Sugarman, who died in her husband's arms in 1998.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Sugarman joined the Navy three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he was an art student at Syracuse University. ''When I went in, America was getting its tailed kicked,'' he said. ''Hitler owned Europe. It was a time of strong national unity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sugarman, who grew up in Syracuse, said that he needed little prodding to join the battle against Hitler. ''I was aware of a lot, as an American Jew,'' he said. ''I saw relatives from Europe at our doorstep.''</p>
        <p>He whipped through Officer Candidates School and found himself among the thousands of men preparing for the ambitious Allied invasion of France. Mr. Sugarman, who had been recently married, wrote to his wife at every opportunity. Unfortunately, the slow delivery system at times nearly drove him mad.</p>
        <p>''It took so long to communicate,'' he said. ''It's so different now, with instantaneous communication. I'd write June a letter every two weeks. I'd get her letters a month later, responding to questions I'd forgotten I had written her about.</p>
        <p>''After I hit Omaha Beach, the letters stopped,'' he said. ''Finally, several weeks passed and I received 60 letters from June. I was wiped out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sugarman landed on Omaha Beach two days after the initial storming of the beach. Briefings had not prepared him for what he found there: unburied bodies and an imposing bluff separating the beach from the roads.</p>
        <p>''You'd look at them and think it impossible for a man with a 25-pound pack and rifle to scale that obstacle,'' he said. ''They were real heroes.''</p>
        <p>After the war, in 1950, the Sugarmans moved to Westport where they raised a family. Mr. Sugarman later enlisted in another battle the civil rights movement of the early 60's.</p>
        <p>''In 1962 I was doing a bit of reportorial drawing for Fortune Magazine,'' he said. ''It was on-site drawing, which is what I love best. That's when I saw for the first time the poverty and oppression.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sugarman later returned to Mississippi to join the students helping blacks register to vote, returning with 100 drawings. The experience compelled him to start Rediscovery Productions, which made 35 documentaries ''mostly on black culture,'' Mr. Sugarman said, who started the company soon after Robert Kennedy was assassinated.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Sugarman fought the civil rights battle longer than the Germans in France, his earlier experience left the greater impression. ''I wanted to talk about the South, where I couldn't talk about the war until 50 years later,'' he said.</p>
