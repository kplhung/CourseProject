        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re: ''Obsessive? No, Just Looking for a Parking Space'' (Oct. 8): Why should we pity anyone who can't find a free parking space? In your article, a deputy commissioner of the Transportation Department, Michael Primeggia, virtually brags about being able to find parking for his household's two (!) cars every night on his block. This despite record volumes of traffic choking the city and destroying the solitude of our neighborhoods. Mr. Primeggia should be looking for ways to get people out of their cars.</p>
        <p>My wife and I both make enough money to own cars. But owning one would be personally irresponsible in a city so easy to get around by foot, bike or mass transit.</p>

        <p>It's testament that the 60 percent of New Yorkers who don't own cars already realize this.</p>
