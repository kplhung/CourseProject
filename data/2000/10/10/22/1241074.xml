        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I grew up far from New York as a fan who lived and died with the Yankees. Though my father grew up primarily in Brooklyn, he was always a Yankees fan, presumably because of his father, who had moved from</p>
        <p>Ukraine to the Lower East Side as a youth and had cheered for the Yankees while becoming one.</p>
        <p>Sadly, with the passing of the decades, my long distance love for the Yankees long ago waned. A few years ago, my older son became an avid fan of the Mets and I have followed in his footsteps. I had even hoped that Roger Clemens would pitch at least one game at Shea, so we could all see how sprightly his reflexes remain.</p>
