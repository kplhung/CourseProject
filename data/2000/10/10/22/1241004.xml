        <p>At the campaign headquarters of a contender in this West African country's presidential election on Sunday, an official admitted that his party had fallen ''very, very, very far from its goal of raising'' about $2.7 million.</p>
        <p>''I won't hide this from you,'' the official, Casimir Katia, said a few days ago, ''but financially the entire campaign rests on one man: our candidate, Thedore Mel.''</p>
        <p>How far reality differed from expectation, Mr. Katia preferred not to say. But the silence inside the building and the absence of supporters suggested that the difference was  significant. A few blocks away, at the headquarters of another little-known candidate, Nicolas Dioulo, scores of people were milling outside: there was no money to send them out campaigning.</p>
        <p>The two are among the five candidates in a contest that the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei, is not expected to lose. Almost all international observers, including those from the United States, have pulled out of the Ivory Coast, saying that voting was unlikely to be fair and that the election was inherently flawed.</p>
        <p>Early this month, a court controlled by the general disqualified the candidates of the country's two biggest political parties, leaving only a single well-known opponent and three lightweights with not enough money to buy billboard advertising. Among those disqualified was Alassane D. Ouattara, the leader of the Rally of Republicans, who until last year had decided on how billions of dollars were distributed worldwide as deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He is now a virtual prisoner inside his villa here.</p>
        <p>The election follows a year-long political crisis in what was the most politically stable country among France's former African colonies,  and is still its richest. General Guei led a coup against an unpopular president, but his own popularity began to wane after it became clear that he had no intention of leaving power. A Christian from the south, he has eliminated his former allies, most of them Muslims from the north. In a country that once stood as a model for ethnic and religious coexistence in Africa, the general has pursued policies that have dangerously widened Ivory Coast's cleavages.</p>
        <p>Given the country's importance on the continent, Africans are watching what happens here closely. And as Election Day approached, Ivorians themselves have grown anxious. Many feared that the tense calm could erupt in violence led by General Guei's military rivals, including two generals who sought refuge in the Nigerian Embassy here and whose whereabouts now are not known. Others speculated that General Guei would hold on to power by coercing politicians to work with him, the same way he has already earned some of their support.</p>
        <p>The two biggest parties have called for a boycott on Sunday. So has the country's largest Islamic association, because all the Muslim candidates were disqualified from running, leaving only five Christians from the south in a nation with a 40 percent Muslim population. And so more important than the election outcome itself might be the voter turnout, which can be taken as a kind of referendum on General Guei's standing.</p>
        <p>In an interview at his office here on Thursday, General Guei said he did not believe that the boycott would work and denied charges that Muslims like Mr. Ouattara and others were being pushed out of politics and the military.</p>
        <p>''Through dialogue we'll reach the wisest solution,'' the general said, dressed in a suit and sitting behind an enormous desk so wide that visitors shook his hand with difficulty. ''It's a question of good faith. The Muslim community should not believe that we are bullying them. We have said that we must separate politics from religion.''</p>
        <p>Asked what he would consider an acceptable voter turnout, he said confidently: ''We must have more than 50 percent for the turnout to be acceptable. It's the minimum. If it's under 50 percent, it will mean that their boycott really worked.''</p>
        <p>Emphasizing that he was willing to accept defeat, the general -- who upon seizing power last year insisted that he was not interested in power and pledged to withdraw after a short transition -- said he wanted to become president to alleviate poverty and unemployment. Above all, he said, he wanted reunify the country.</p>
        <p>''We must reconcile all Ivoirians,'' he said. ''There must be understanding, brotherhood and harmony.''</p>
        <p>Few believe he can do that. The general last week canceled a scheduled trip to the Muslim north over security concerns. Except for a spontaneous visit to the country's most exclusive shopping mall here, where he bought shoes and several bottles of gin, he has hardly campaigned at all. He justified his absence by saying he was letting the ''people campaign for him,'' but most of the people took that to mean he wanted to avoid going out on the streets.</p>
        <p>On Abidjan's streetscape, the campaign's most visible signs are billboards showing the general's smiling face. ''The people are my party,'' says the general, who tried to become the candidate of the country's oldest and richest party, the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, but was pointedly rejected. The only other candidate with the means to buy billboard space was Laurent Gbagbo, whose party, the Ivoirian Popular Front, is considered the country's third biggest; Mr. Gbagbo has also run an ethnocentric campaign aimed at rallying Christians against Muslims.</p>
        <p>Many of the general's billboards and wall posters have been defaced, suggesting what conversations with Ivoirians, regardless of their backgrounds, have made clear -- that they wanted a fair election and a civilian president.</p>
        <p>Justin Kouakou, a 32-year-old worker in the fishing industry, was walking past a defaced billboard in the working class neighborhood of Port-Bouet. A Christian southerner, he supported the elimination of Mr. Ouattara, who the court ruled was not completely Ivoirian. But he did not want General Guei to remain in power.</p>
        <p>''When he took over last year,'' Mr. Kouakou said, ''he said it was to sweep clean the Ivoirian house. But things have gotten worse under him. Before I could drink chilled water. Now I can't even buy a box of matches.''</p>
        <p>In the shadow of the billboard, Abou Ouattara, 25, had stopped to wash his taxi. On a concrete wall someone had blotted out General Guei's eyes with black paint. ''Voleur,'' someone had scrawled across the poster. ''Thief.''</p>
        <p>The taxi driver, a Muslim northerner, was a supporter of the politician with the same name. ''I've been told to boycott the election,'' he said. ''But I would like to vote. I want to participate because if we Africans don't take part in the democratic process, in the end it will hurt us.''</p>
        <p>The campaign against Muslim leaders like Mr. Ouattara has affected him, the taxi driver said. Nowadays, he said, police harass him regularly and, looking at his name, call him a foreigner.</p>
        <p>Diplomats based here said they were worried the anti-Muslim tide will spiral out of control, especially in the military. About 300 Muslim soldiers have left the military on their own, a Western diplomat said, and it is not known what they are doing.</p>
        <p>''It's quiet right now,'' the diplomat said. ''But there's a strong undercurrent of worry because of those soldiers who have left.''</p>
        <p>Amnesty International said soldiers who were arrested for their alleged involvement in an attack on General Guei's house last month had been tortured, killed or missing. Mr. Ouattara's party says that at least 40 Muslim military officials have disappeared, and party officials said they suspected that the soldiers were killed or being held illegally.</p>
        <p>''This is a sham election -- that's why we have called for a boycott,'' said Ali Coulibaly, a spokesman for the Rally of the Republicans. ''Whoever wins, the president will be illegitimate.''</p>
