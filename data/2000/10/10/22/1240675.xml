        <p>THE American Avant Garde: A Decade of Change, 1936-1946'' at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich is a show about how we got from here to there.</p>
        <p>The development of American art in the mid-20th century was especially tumultuous. Under the influence of the Great Depression, art had a distinct social and populist stance. After the Second World War, Abstract Expressionism was taking a firm hold. Art had gone from public to personal expression.</p>
        <p>To bring this history to life, the museum's art curator, Nancy Hall-Duncan, enlisted the aid of a recognized scholar in the art of the period: Irving Sandler, who teaches art history at Purchase College and is the author of the most influential text on Abstract Expressionism, ''The Triumph of American Painting.''</p>
        <p>Together they keep the story compelling by having prime examples of what they want to illustrate. Lesser works would certainly have taken us off the trail. How an emotional abstraction grew, not seamlessly but not so improbably either, out of intense social realism and formal abstraction has been examined before, but never with the extreme concentration of this show.</p>
        <p>No one in the panoply exhibits the fragility inherent in forging a new art than Arshile Gorky. His delicate but animated abstractions based on living forms had an influence too large to overestimate on the work of the later Abstract Expressionists whose work is defined by boldness. Gorky, an Armenian-born American who lived in Sherman, Conn., in his last years committed suicide in 1948. The two intense works by him in the show, a study for a painting titled ''Agony'' and a composition called ''The Horns of the Landscape'' that features a lot of bleeding color, provide a window into both personal torment and the invention of a personal vocabulary with which to portray it.</p>
        <p>Chronologically, Gorky's example comes late in the story. Viewers' heads will be turned at the rather cornball work that opens the show, Grant Wood's barroom scene, ''Sentimental Ballad.'' The curators found a number of realist paintings, both rural and urban, that clearly make the point that Regionalism and Modernism couldn't be further apart.</p>
        <p>That regional lineup includes ''Cotton Pickers'' by Jackson Pollock, a reminder that one of Pollock's major teachers was Thomas Hart Benton, the Social Realist par excellence. Benton is represented by vigorous examples and viewers sense that there was some flow from realism into Abstract Expressionism. But nascent Abstract Expressionism was also fed by Surrealism (many influential Surrealists were in exile in the United States during the War) as well as abstraction of a more cerebral sort.</p>
        <p>A couple of thickly painted works by John Graham, who was born Ivan Dombrowski in Russia, are a reminder that artistic influence cannot always be pinned down. It is always remarked that Graham's ideas were a major influence on the American painters but his paintings themselves are often wan and sentimental. The vigorous examples here, a still-life and a dancing figure titled ''Zeus,'' are strongly colored and vigorously painted -- the sort of paintings that could inspire boldness in a group of painters forging a style.</p>
        <p>The exhibition includes an ample number of works with a basis in geometry, in which one can see rigidity loosening up. Gertrude Greene's painted wood construction features some cut-out sections with soft contours. David Smith's steel sculpture ''Study for Arches'' and Alexander Calder's ''Starfish'' also show Biomorphism easily and peacefully encroaching on what had been sharp-angle territory. Another influence was Hans Hofmann, the German-born painter who is remembered as a teacher with specific theories. His own paintings might superficially resemble Abstract Expressionism, but the requisite emotion isn't there. His ''Mirage'' with its emphasis on the relationship of planes illustrates this.</p>
        <p>The exhibition implicitly requires that viewers have some knowledge of the mature Abstract Expressionism of the ensuing decade, because  many of the works here, which capture incipient ideas, are like baby pictures that can't be fully appreciated unless one knows the full-grown person.</p>
        <p>An untitled work on paper by Willem de Kooning from 1942 is a beautiful reminder of his uncanny knack for making harmonious colors that shouldn't go together: yellow, pink and blue. Norman Lewis was an African-American painter whose abstract art can, usually covertly, contain social references. Clusters of tiny marks can sometimes be read as groups of figures massed together for a cause, and his ''Winter Branches'' gives hints of this.</p>
        <p>Mark Rothko has become a popular painter, a venerated one and perhaps a misread one. In his most recognizable work, the grand themes of ecstasy and tragedy are contained in soft-edged forms, and there has been endless debate about how literally these nimbus-like forms should be read. It is amusing therefore to come across a painting from 1939-40 that features a figure wrapped in clouds. Zeus, perhaps?</p>
        <p>Clyfford Still's paintings of thick sculpted paint can hint at cataclysm. Often his shapes can seem like fissures that open onto other dimensions, so there is a literal as well as philosophical profundity in his paintings. The one here, from 1945, is predominately in brown, but with a bright splotch of white in the center. Grant Wood's lighted balladeers emerge out of brown, too. But in moving from Wood to Still, sentimentality is a casualty.</p>
        <p>''The American Avant Garde: A Decade of Change 1936-1946'' is at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich through Dec. 31.</p>
