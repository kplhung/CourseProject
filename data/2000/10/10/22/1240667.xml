        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist column answers questions about third party candidates' role in upcoming presidential election and whether it is better to vote for good or against evil and trying out video cameras at department store then buying one for $100 less on Internet (M)</p>

        <p>In the coming presidential election, a third-party candidate best represents our beliefs, but we fear that a vote for him will help elect the worse of the two major-party candidates. However, to vote out of fear for the less bad major-party candidate works against desired long-term change. So, which is better: to vote for good or against evil? -- K. Cohen and M. Hoffmann, Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>It is as honorable to oppose the wicked as to champion the good, and it is a traditional part of American politics. In 1946, Republican Congressional candidates ran under the slogan ''Had Enough? Vote Republican.'' Two years later, the C.I.O. chief Philip Murray, campaigning for Truman, declared, ''We don't want our government under the control of bankers and corporate interests.'' Even that most-invoked of ethical guides, the Ten Commandments, presents most of its rules in negative terms, or as votes against -- thou shalt not (although it takes no explicit position on the Truman-Dewey race).</p>

        <p>In the coming presidential election, a third-party candidate best represents our beliefs, but we fear that a vote for him will help elect the worse of the two major-party candidates. However, to vote out of fear for the less bad major-party candidate works against desired long-term change. So, which is better: to vote for good or against evil? -- K. Cohen and M. Hoffmann, Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>It is as honorable to oppose the wicked as to champion the good, and it is a traditional part of American politics. In 1946, Republican Congressional candidates ran under the slogan ''Had Enough? Vote Republican.'' Two years later, the C.I.O. chief Philip Murray, campaigning for Truman, declared, ''We don't want our government under the control of bankers and corporate interests.'' Even that most-invoked of ethical guides, the Ten Commandments, presents most of its rules in negative terms, or as votes against -- thou shalt not (although it takes no explicit position on the Truman-Dewey race).</p>
        <p>Some will tell you that the duties of civic life, as much an ethical obligation as any, compel you to vote for the third-party candidate who has your heart. You'll lose in the short run, but in the long run you'll steer the country in the direction you believe is right; popular third-party ideas often move into the mainstream. Others will argue that in politics there is no long run: the next president, for example, might appoint at least three Supreme Court justices and many more federal judges, so you should vote for the lesser of big-party evils.</p>
        <p>My solution is, perversely, to vote for a third-party candidate only where he can't win. If you live in Texas, where Bush is way ahead, or in New York, where Gore has a solid lead, you can vote for your third-party candidate without fear of tilting the race to the big-party candidate you dread.</p>
        <p>The great labor organizer Eugene V. Debs made another argument. Debs ran for president five times as the Socialist candidate. While he was campaigning in 1908, a man in the crowd shouted that to vote for Debs was to waste your vote. Debs replied: ''You argue that you are throwing your vote away. That's right. Don't vote for freedom -- you might not get it. Vote for slavery -- you have a cinch on that.'' Debs lost all his races. His last defeat, to Harding, ushered in one of the most scandal-plagued administrations in our history.</p>
        <p>I needed a video camera, so I went to a department store where the clerk educated me on the various models and let me try them out to see which I liked best. Then I went home and bought it for $100 less on the Internet. I feel bad about it, but not $100 worth. Is that terrible? -- W.W., Lubbock, Tex.</p>
        <p>It is not. You may buy that camera any place you choose. However, your good behavior can lead to bad results: if everyone does what you did, the store will go under, and you'll have nowhere to try out new cameras. You must make a rational calculation of what is in your best interest -- short-term savings or long-term shopping opportunities.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, this problem may be resolved by changes not in the buyer but in the seller. To survive, stores must provide incentives for people to shop there -- helpful staff, quick repairs, great service, free pony rides for the kids. Otherwise they can't vie with online outlets that have advantages of their own -- low overhead, no sales tax, huge inventory. It is that edge that lets a savvy outfit like Amazon lose -- what is it? -- a billion dollars a minute?</p>
