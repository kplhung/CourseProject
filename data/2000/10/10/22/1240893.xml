        <p>The article regarding Little League ['' 'Minors' and 'Majors' Come to Scarsdale,'' Oct. 15] is a snapshot of what is wrong with parents today. The overriding sentiment expressed in the article concerns posssible damage to a child's self-esteem if they are not placed on the Major League team.

        <p>The article regarding Little League ['' 'Minors' and 'Majors' Come to Scarsdale,'' Oct. 15] is a snapshot of what is wrong with parents today. The overriding sentiment expressed in the article concerns posssible damage to a child's self-esteem if they are not placed on the Major League team. These parents are missing an opportunity to teach their children about life.</p>
        <p>One, disappointment is part of life; how you handle it determines the type of person you are. If your child is placed on the Minor Leagur team, why not show him that it is hard work that will allow him to move up, not a parent's intervention?</p>
        <p>Two, why should the better players be forced to play with those who view it as purely recreation? The fact is, in baseball and in life, that there will always be some people who are more skilled than others.</p>
