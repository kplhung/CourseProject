        <p>JUST as the summer harvest fades, artichokes are back on the scene. When I was growing up, we only had them two ways: hot, with hollandaise, or cold, with mayonnaise. Each leaf was savored until you got down to the best part: the heart, or bottom.</p>
        <p>Now, however, I prepare artichokes so many other ways that I rarely cook them whole. I can even discard the leaves without feeling guilty about wasting the piece of flesh at each base. I braise artichokes in white wine, deep-fry them or serve them in raw, paper-thin slices sprinkled with olive oil and lemon. Slivered and fried, the baby ones make a lovely topping for a stew. Cut into wedges, they are delicious sauteed with other vegetables, like Florence fennel, carrots or potatoes.</p>

        <p>Now, however, I prepare artichokes so many other ways that I rarely cook them whole. I can even discard the leaves without feeling guilty about wasting the piece of flesh at each base. I braise artichokes in white wine, deep-fry them or serve them in raw, paper-thin slices sprinkled with olive oil and lemon. Slivered and fried, the baby ones make a lovely topping for a stew. Cut into wedges, they are delicious sauteed with other vegetables, like Florence fennel, carrots or potatoes.</p>
        <p>As you trim artichokes, drop them into a bowl of cold acidulated water to stop their turning brown. You can also rub them with a little olive oil or lemon juice.</p>
        <p>On a recent evening I had intended to cook veal chops on the grill outdoors. But it was a cold, wet night, so I coated them with a paste made of prosciutto fat, sage and lemon peel and sauteed them in a cast-iron pan. As an accompaniment, artichokes, sauteed in olive oil with a little garlic, could not have been bettered.</p>
        <p>Artichokes and Sage With Veal Chops  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2 artichokes</p>
        <p>Approximately 4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
        <p>1 clove garlic, minced (green part removed)</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley</p>
        <p>2 ounces prosciutto ends, chopped, at room temperature</p>
        <p>4 strips organic lemon peel</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons fresh sage leaves</p>
        <p>2 thick-cut veal chops, at room temperature.</p>
        <p>1. Slice the tops of the artichokes about one-third of the way down and discard them. Trim the outer leaves. Cut the artichokes into eighths, trimming away the choke and any tough dark green parts.</p>
        <p>2. Heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet and add the artichokes. Pour in about three-fourths of a cup of water and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook the artichokes, stirring occasionally, until the water has boiled off and they are tender and golden brown, adding the garlic just before the artichokes have finished cooking so the garlic becomes soft but not burned. Sprinkle with parsley and keep warm while you cook the chops.</p>
        <p>3. Put the prosciutto ends, lemon peel, sage leaves, salt and pepper to taste in a blender. Add just enough olive oil to process into a thick paste. Press the mixture onto both sides of the veal chops.</p>
        <p>4. Heat a heavy skillet (preferably made of cast iron) until it is very hot, then add the chops. Cook them on both sides, turning the heat down to medium after they have been seared. Cook four to five minutes on each side for medium rare.</p>
        <p>5. Put the chops on two heated plates. Then divide the artichokes between those two plates and you are ready to serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 servings.</p>
        <p>Artichokes With Fennel And Parmesan  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>4 small or 2 large heads fennel</p>
        <p>2 pounds baby artichokes</p>
        <p>Half a lemon</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>2 cloves garlic, crushed</p>
        <p>Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
        <p>Freshly grated Parmesan</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Trim stalks from the fennel. Cut the bulbs into quarters and steam or boil them until barely tender.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, slice off the tops of the artichokes about one-third of the way down and discard them. Trim the outer leaves and stalks and cut the artichokes into quarters. As you trim each artichoke, put it in a bowl of cold water into which you have squeezed the half lemon.</p>
        <p>3. Heat the oil in a large skillet (use two skillets if necessary; the vegetables should be in one layer). Dry the artichokes in a salad spinner or with paper towels. Saute them with the garlic cloves for about 10 minutes. Add the fennel and continue to cook, stirring frequently until the vegetables are tender and golden brown. Season to taste with salt and pepper, sprinkle with Parmesan and parsley and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Sauteed Artichokes And Potatoes  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>1 pound Yukon Gold or fingerling potatoes</p>
        <p>2 pounds baby artichokes</p>
        <p>Half a lemon</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>2 cloves garlic, in their skins</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon thyme leaves</p>
        <p>Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Cut the potatoes into inch-and-a-half pieces and steam them until barely tender.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, slice off the tops of the artichokes about one-third of the way down and discard them. Trim the outer leaves and stalks and cut the artichokes into quarters. As you trim each artichoke, put it in a bowl of cold water into which you have squeezed the half lemon. This will stop it from turning brown.</p>
        <p>3. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Dry the artichokes in a salad spinner or with paper towels. Saute them with the potatoes, garlic and thyme leaves, turning the vegetables frequently until they are tender and golden brown. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
