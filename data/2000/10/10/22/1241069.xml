        <p>For 58 minutes 26 seconds tonight, Michael Vick was merely human. He had been sacked 8 times, had lost 46 yards the 15 times he had tried to run the ball and had completed 6 passes for 75 yards. Virginia Tech was clinging to a 15-14 lead with the clock winding down and the Hokies had third-and-5 at their 45-yard line.</p>
        <p>Vick faked a handoff to Lee Suggs and sprinted left. He sweeped around the Syracuse line and found a swifter gear to angle toward the corner of the end zone.</p>
        <p>Fifty-five yards later he was in the end zone with one more highlight for his Heisman Trophy reel and a 22-14 victory for the undefeated Hokies, No. 1 in the New York Times computer ranking and No. 2 in the Associated Press poll.</p>
        <p>Finally, the raucous crowd of 49,003 at the Carrier Dome had reason to head for the exits. As good as the Syracuse defense had been, it could not send Vick and Virginia Tech home humbled. Vick's numbers were less than ordinary, 9 yards rushing and 75 passing. So were his team's: Tech was outgained, 328 yards to 240.</p>
        <p>But the Hokies (7-0, 5-0 Big East) remained on track to return to the national title game because of a young defense that forced five turnovers and held the Orangemen (3-4, 1-2) scoreless for the last three quarters of the game.</p>
        <p>Last week against West Virginia, the Hokies turned a 14-7 halftime deficit into a 48-20 rout by scoring three touchdowns over a six-minute span in the third quarter. Against the Orangemen it took them less than four minutes to overcome an 11-point deficit.</p>
        <p>After a punt by Ben Taylor -- the Hokies' starting linebacker who was making only his second kick of the year -- pinned the Orangemen on their own 2, Syracuse quarterback Troy Nunes made an awful mistake. On third-and-10, Nunes got his feet tangled as he pulled back from center. He tried to throw the ball away as he fell, but his rainbow pass was picked off at the 15-yard line by Willie Pile and returned to the 5.</p>
        <p>Two plays later, Vick pitched to Suggs on the option for a 5-yard touchdown. The Hokies' 2-point attempt failed.</p>
        <p>On the next possession, the Virginia Tech defense forced another turnover -- a fumble on the end of a flea-flicker that looked like a big gainer for Syracuse. Nunes took the pitchback and drilled a pass to wide receiver Maurice Jackson. But Jackson, in an effort to get extra yardage, was smashed by Hokie cornerback Eric Green and lost the ball. Linebacker Jake Houseright scooped it up on the bounce and returned it to the 21-yard line.</p>
        <p>Virginia Tech took 2 minutes 34 seconds before Suggs banged the ball in the end zone from the 1-yard line. Suggs finished with 21 carries for 91 yards and 2 touchdowns. Again, the 2-point conversion failed when Vick's pass fell incomplete, but the Hokies led, 15-14, with 2:49 left in the third.</p>
        <p>In an electric first half, Syracuse appeared intent on avenging its 62-0 loss last year in Blacksburg, Va. The Orangemen had history on their side -- they had a 14-3 series lead and the home team had won this matchup the last nine meetings.</p>
        <p>The Orangemen rushed out to two touchdowns in the first quarter against a team that had given up a total of 10 first-half points in its previous six games. On its opening drive, Syracuse took 5:25 to go 93 yards. Most of the yardage was gained on an improbable play that took 3 seconds. On third-and-15 on his 31-yard line, Nunes, fresh off a four-interception nightmare against Boston College, heaved a wobbly pass down the right sideline. Three Hokies converged on the badly underthrown ball and one, cornerback Eric Green, had it in his hands briefly for an apparent interception.</p>
        <p>But Jackson, who had caught just seven passes this season, wrested the ball from Green and flopped to the ground with a 54-yard reception on the Virginia Tech 15. Two plays later, Nunes strung out the Hokie line on the option, and at the last minute, pitched to running back Dee Brown, who scooted into the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>Nunes and Jackson were just getting acquainted. After the Syracuse defense forced Virginia Tech to punt, the pair needed just 57 seconds to hook up again.</p>
        <p>This time, it was on third-and-19 from the Syracuse 22. Jackson bolted down the left sideline, and Nunes stepped up in the pocket and lofted a pass that arced over the outside shoulder of Jackson, who beat cornerback Ronyell Whitaker. When Whitaker stumbled and fell, Jackson loped into the end zone to give Syracuse a 14-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Jackson finished with 4 catches for 155 yards and Nunes was 13 of 25 for 217 yards and 4 interceptions.</p>
