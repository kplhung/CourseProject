        <p>TIM AND BLANCHE BRANTON live in a typical boxy postwar apartment, but one would never know it. Their place is a lesson in how vacuous spaces (unlike vacuous politicians) can be injected with character.</p>
        <p>Sitting in their living room across from a large low semicircular sofa that is occupied by a very lifelike toy cat, a visitor can almost find it difficult to carry on a conversation because of the visual stimulation -- the baby doll on the small sofa, the fountain with the stones, the oval coffee table with the silver tray deep inside.</p>
        <p>The Brantons are gleeful and eclectic collectors who have been married for 33 years, but only recently have they had the space to accommodate the fruits of their shopping, which seem to fill every bit of space not needed for navigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Branton, an American who as a child lived in Belgium and France, where his father was in the diamond business, moved into a one-bedroom rental at 401 East 74th Street in 1962, when he was a young man working in corporate public relations. Not long after, he was on a bus when he saw his future wife, who had grown up on a farm in West Virginia and had just moved to New York to work as a flight attendant. ''I made it clear I would immediately kill myself if she didn't allow me to see her again,''  Mr. Branton said.</p>
        <p>For years, the Brantons lived in that one-bedroom place, raising their  son, Matthew, who is now 20, building him a bedroom in what had been the  dining area. Their son would occasionally lament that he was growing while the apartment was not. Mr. Branton became convinced that another, larger apartment would show up. ''I was so sure of this, I started buying more furniture,'' he said. His wife, he recalled, ''thought I was completely mad.''</p>
        <p>Finally, four years ago, they had an opportunity to buy their apartment, which is at the end of a long hallway, as well as an identical one across the hall, for a total of slightly more than $200,000. They got their apartment at an insider price.</p>
        <p>They hired an architect and a contractor and combined the spaces, adding moldings and bookcases. Toward the end, they realized that what they really needed was a piece of the hallway.</p>
        <p>Taking additional space would give them a gracious entry, something that apartments built in the 1960's and 1970's rarely offer. But because they asked late in the process, the co-op board refused the request.</p>
        <p>A YEAR and a half ago, with a different board in place, they made the request again. The negotiations were slow, mainly because the board had to figure out how many shares their section of the hallway would have, as well as its price and maintenance. But finally it did, and the Brantons were able to buy the space for $6,700, a price that would probably be higher if it was being negotiated in today's market. Their monthly maintenance is now $2,050.</p>
        <p>The board, Mr. Branton said, was wonderful to work with. ''I didn't have to get permission to use a power screwdriver,'' he said, referring to the acceleration of tales regarding ever-stricter co-op boards.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Linda Watson, the board president, said the building welcomed plans to combine or expand apartments.</p>
        <p>''It's good business sense for co-ops,'' she said, because it encourages people to stay as their needs change.  ''You want stability in your occupants,'' she said. ''When people are in and out, they don't care what happens to the hallway, or the lobby.''</p>
        <p>Now the Brantons enter a foyer with a curved ceiling, concealed  lighting and a chair rail to define the yellow wall above and wallpaper below -- decorated, of course, in their quirky style. Greeting visitors is the tall figure of a wicker woman, a display model Mrs. Branton found at a gift show at the Javits Center. At her feet, sitting on the new terra cotta floor, is a small metal dog that belonged to Mr. Branton's grandmother. A Chinese carving hangs on the wall.</p>
        <p>They like the look of the new foyer, which has one set of doors at the entrance and a second set, with panes of stained glass, leading into the rest of the apartment. But more than that, they like its function.  ''Having two sets of doors cut the noise,'' she said. It also makes her more comfortable playing the dulcimer, knowing the neighbors won't be bothered.</p>
        <p>During the years they lived in their one-bedroom apartment with their  growing child, the Brantons thought about getting something larger, but just never did. ''At first, it was inertia,'' Mrs. Branton said. The rent was  low, and their son was going to nearby private schools. She was working as a flight attendant, which meant she was ''in and out all the time -- it takes energy to do all this.''</p>
        <p>Now they both have more time to dedicate to their home. Mr. Branton does consulting work, and Mrs. Branton, who retired from her job a few years ago, is working on a book on spiritual development that has come to her through channeling, she said. Over the years, she has been developing her abilities to do that. ''She started with the Ouija board,'' her husband said admiringly. ''Blanche is far more interesting than I am. She's a direct descendant of Stonewall Jackson.''</p>
        <p>Hard to say, though, which Branton is more interesting or original. It  was Mr. Branton who designed their very unusual bed, which is basically two twin beds put not side by side but head to head. ''She likes a soft mattress, and I like a hard one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After giving a tour of their apartment, the Brantons served lunch, using some new polka-dotted, hand-blown glasses they just found on a trip to West Virginia. ''We swear we're never going to buy another thing,'' Mrs. Branton said. ''And then . . .'' She just smiled.</p>
        <p>As did her husband, who explained: ''We just have fun doing that kind of thing.''</p>
