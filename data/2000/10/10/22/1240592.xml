        <p>The Family Orchard</p>
        <p>By Nomi Eve.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 316 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $25.</p>
        <p>Nomi Eve's impressive debut novel, ''The Family Orchard,'' is a six-generation family memoir recast as fiction. Translated into Hebrew, the title could be ''The Family Paradise.'' The word for ''orchard'' in Hebrew is pardess, which is derived from the ancient Persian pairi daeza, but it can also refer to that first divine orchard and its famous tree in the Garden of Eden, or Paradise, from which man was forever expelled.</p>
        <p>Set almost entirely in Israel, the book spans 160 years of tumultuous Israeli and family history, from the 1830's, when Palestine was part of the Turkish Empire, through the three major waves, or aliyahs, of Jewish immigration, the British mandate, modern statehood and warfare, up to the present. Historical figures and events flit past in the background of the characters' lives. Unlike most conventional triple-decker novels in this genre, ''The Family Orchard'' is stripped clean of nostalgia and honeyed sentimentality, and the family romance presented here is anything but a paradise. Despite the chronological timeline, reams of plot and a dizzying cast of characters, ''The Family Orchard'' is very much a postmodern novel, heavily indebted to the fabulist, phantasmagorical fiction of I. B. Singer and David Grossman and the esoteric, now fashionable, legends and stories of the cabala.</p>
        <p>This family saga is told like a polyphonic fugue: the novel as written by the author is labeled ''I write''; it is a fictionalized version of the story told by the author's father, which is labeled ''my father writes.'' The father's account is straightforward and factual, a running historical commentary inserted into the author's text as marginalia or counterpoint. A page in this book looks like a page of Talmud, in which the central passage is surrounded by paragraphs of rabbinical interpretation. Another voice, labeled ''I tell'' and addressed directly to the reader, allows the author to stand outside the narrative she has created and comment omnisciently on it.</p>
        <p>Since many of the characters are pardesanim, or orchard workers, a glossary of agricultural terminology (in Hebrew and English) that explains methods of growing citrus trees is included. There are also illustrations, old lithographs inserted into the novel as in a textbook; they lend a whimsical amplification to the story, like the photographs in W. G. Sebald's ''Emigrants.'' Eve presents not one family tree, as would be expected, but 11 -- a veritable orchard interspersed through the text -- which sprout branches and generations as the novel progresses.</p>
        <p>If this all sounds far too clever, exquisitely self-conscious and intellectually pretentious, it is saved by Eve's startling, imaginative and allegorical writing, which sparkles and surprises and never settles for the predictable. In addition, the author deals directly and cogently with the problem of writing a family memoir, where fact and fiction, reality and lies, coexist in an uneasy, messy standoff: ''I believe that fiction is formed truth,'' she writes. And although she claims that her ''history isn't true to its root because I know nothing,'' she also says that ''certain kinds of stories don't need legs of proof to walk on, don't need water facts to drink.''</p>
        <p>While many early Zionists came to Palestine to fulfill either a political dream or to enact a religious imperative, the first few generations in ''The Family Orchard'' are not driven by either of these motives. Lust and sex are the life forces here. Esther, the author's great-great-great-grandmother, carries on a nine-year affair with a Jerusalem baker. But there are rules: the husband is restricted to her vagina; the lover to her anus. ''The notion of separate facilities,'' Eve wickedly writes, ''fit nicely into the ready framework of kashrut. Milk here, meat there, and as long as there was proper distance between things, everything stayed quietly kosher.''</p>
        <p>In the next generation, the step-siblings Golda and Eliezer conduct an illicit affair, described in almost pornographic language, before they settle into a long, passionate marriage. Their child, Avra, is an inventive kleptomaniac, a spy who steals ammunition from the Turkish Army. In 1909, she marries Shimon Sepher, the first in a long line of orchard workers. (This is a private joke: sefer is Hebrew for ''book''; the author's father's surname is Buch.)</p>
        <p>Moshe and Zohar, Avra's twin boys, enjoy a seemingly carefree childhood, but with their appearance, the novel turns darker and more fantastic. (Zohar's name hints at this shift: the Zohar is a 13th-century book of Jewish mysticism and the canonical text of the cabala.) Moshe dies in battle in the 1948 war of independence, the bullet also wounding his twin many miles away. Zohar marries Miriam, a skilled seamstress who ''sewed stories into her cloth.'' Magically, these old-country, Singeresque tales of carnality and sexual frustration create chaos for those who wear her handiwork.</p>
        <p>In the soil beneath a mango tree, Eliezer, one of Zohar's sons and the author's father, draws the outline of a human figure and tries to conjure a golem out of the ground. In Jewish mysticism, a golem is a supernatural creature created from dirt and with magical words. As a metaphor for artistic creation, the golem legend seems irresistible for writers. Like the Frankenstein monster, golems are supposed to be benign and protective, but as they are made by man, not God, they are imperfect and frequently run amok. Eliezer also makes lists of words and their numerical equivalences, using a cabalistic spiritual math called gematria, in which each letter of the Hebrew alphabet has a numerical value. The mystics used this method to interpret religious texts, but Eliezer's lists are a form of therapy, an attempt to understand why his uncle died, why his mentally defective brother, Gavi, has been banished from the family. In his calculations, nothing makes sense: ''There were no numbers -- real or imaginary -- that could give him the sum he needed.''</p>
        <p>By the time Eliezer's child, the author Nomi Eve, appears in ''The Family Orchard,'' the novel has lost some of its inventive force, and its rococo excess has imploded. Eve is preoccupied with writing this book. ''I write to build a word-museum,'' she says, ''for what is a family but a living hall of a loved one's many faces?'' But the author also implies that her attempt to recapture the past, even in this bravura performance, is inherently flawed, stating, ''We are not made of words: flesh and blood are not pages.''</p>
