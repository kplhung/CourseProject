        <p>A New World</p>
        <p>By Amit Chaudhuri.</p>
        <p>192 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $22.</p>
        <p>Sleep can be a refuge from intolerable anguish; but it is thin and vulnerable, restless and soon over. Humiliated when his wife leaves him for another man -- partly bald, moreover, and with bad breath -- Jayojit Chatterjee takes leave of his life in California to spend the summer with his parents in Calcutta. Amit Chaudhuri portrays this retreat into childhood reassurance as a sleep of its own: briefly consoling and mournfully fragile.</p>
        <p>Author of a trilogy of novellas that evoke the amiable languor and stagnant poisons of his native city, Chaudhuri employs both art and risk in ''A New World.'' Mirroring Jayojit's somnolence, the story fades away at times; mirroring its sweetness, the writing is lovely; mirroring the shards of painful memory that pierce the lethargy -- nails through a fakir's mattress -- the languor of the summer narrative is interrupted by snippets of the year-round realities Jayojit has temporarily shed.</p>
        <p>Jayojit works to give substance to the daily details of his Calcutta holiday, as if they, not his broken marriage and position as an economics professor, were his real life. He clings to them like a dream that fights awakening.</p>
        <p>With his young son, Bonny, whom he has managed to wrest from his ex-wife, Jayojit lands at the airport after an interminably circuitous flight on a Bangladeshi airline, chosen to save money. He feels light and floating, his burdens unshouldered. When the taxi driver overcharges him, he laughs as if the fare were play money.</p>
        <p>Calcutta promises respite and cosseting. As soon as Jayojit and Bonny arrive, sticky and tired, his mother offers to assemble a greasy breakfast. They lack the energy to touch it. (Her cooking, Chaudhuri writes, in one of many phrases that give wings to this purposely still story, ''was safe and insipid, and had a tranquillity about it.'') ''Have a bath, then, you two,'' offers the father, a retired admiral. Bathing is nourishment in the steamy city.</p>
        <p>The days pass, easy and torpid. Bonny, whose displaced-child docility the author suggests without ever mentioning it, plays with his set of plastic dinosaurs. Jayojit takes naps and baths, rambles through the neighborhood, chats with the neighbors, does small errands. Some of the chapters are nothing but errands, accomplished slowly.</p>
        <p>''Snapshots'' is too active a word for Chaudhuri's portraits of life in his family's middle-class apartment compound. ''Old postcards'' is more like it: a dog barking, the slumbrous watchman at the gate, the drivers hanging about the tea-stall outside, the pavilion from where the building's laundry is delivered crisp each day. ''There were few things to rival washed clothes in their undisappointing recurrence.''</p>
        <p>At times nothing moves at all: not in Jayojit's summer days, not in the pages of the book. It is a dead calm, and it can be trying for the reader. Gradually it becomes trying for Jayojit, as he begins to outsleep himself. And from his restless rest, Chaudhuri assembles a moving portrait of aging parents and a son whose troubles mark them, just as their decline marks him.</p>
        <p>The apartment is decent but cramped. Evenings, the sound of television (''a form of public dreaming'') drifts from next door. Admiral Chatterjee -- a rear admiral, actually -- is living on a pension whose value is shrinking and on investments too cautious to profit from the securities boom. Jayojit, an economist of some small repute (his bugbear is Americans who ask him about Amartya Sen), is an occasional consultant to the Indian government. He is helpless, as economists tend to be, when his father shyly hints that he could use some financial advice.</p>
        <p>Admiral Chatterjee speaks a bluff naval English (though he was an independence nationalist as a young officer). He used to frequent the officers' club; now diabetes and a small stroke have sapped his energy. More profoundly, so has his loss of position, perks and deference. He schools himself to be simply one more old man to bank clerks and shop attendants. There is a fragile habit of command, still, but puzzlement beneath it. He feels threatened by his wife's quiet plea for a washing machine; they must make do with the part-time help that is all they can afford. It is change he fears. As for Mrs. Chatterjee, change might be welcome -- perhaps in everything except deference to her husband.</p>
        <p>Jayojit's holiday has a little while to go but it is over, in fact. Even on holiday, life intrudes. Jayojit will buy a washing machine for his mother; he has a purposeful though wonderfully indirect talk with the family doctor, an old friend, about his father's health.</p>
        <p>The artfully -- perhaps too artfully -- hidden thread that runs through Jayojit's Calcutta story is, of course, what happened to his marriage. Until Bonny's birth, he and Amala had been passionate and seemingly loving. ''Then unfamiliarity set in, though no one else would notice it, and they got used to even that. The child, instead of bringing them together, actually enabled them to separate into their own spheres of desire and loneliness.''</p>
        <p>Amala moved out, sued for divorce and got full custody of Bonny. Jayojit -- tigerish in California, a tiger tranquilized at his parents' -- fired his lawyer, hired another, brought an unusual action in an Indian court and won vacation rights. Chaudhuri feeds us these things one scrap at a time, spaced between the Calcutta errands, naps and walks. Frustratingly, it never quite makes a full meal, though it infuses tension into the stillness. It also represents, perhaps oversubtly, Jayojit's own need to blot the story out for a while.</p>
        <p>In fact, the real weight of the breakup is conveyed not in the brief, grudging facts, but in what it has done to Jayojit's father and mother. Again, the disclosures are scattered, but they are devastating. ''In a strange way, they felt abandoned,'' Chaudhuri slips in at one point. Overweight and failing, the admiral has begun to take conscientious morning walks. He doesn't much want to live longer, but ''he felt this need to see Jayojit through.''</p>
        <p>Most quiet and affecting is an aside about the parents' television habits. They had been addicted to soap opera romances. Then, during Jayojit's custody battles, they stopped watching. ''They'd found they could no longer immerse themselves, or even find a center, however temporary, in a proxy existence.'' Holmes's dog that didn't bark illuminated a murder; the Chatterjees' unwatched TV illuminates a different death.</p>
