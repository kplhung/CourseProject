        <p>The Rich Forum, Stamford's downtown arts center, usually features opera, ballet and concert performers like Peter, Paul and Mary and the Village People. But for two days this week, the quiet theater was a gathering place for two dozen police chiefs and police union presidents. They discussed racial profiling and other issues that strain relations between the police and racial minority groups, and strove to find solutions.</p>
        <p>The police officials, who came from throughout New England, were guided in their efforts by the Community Relations Service and the Office of Community Oriented Policing, two divisions of the United States Justice Department. They were joined at various points by several experts, including William J. Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner, and Prof. George L. Kelling of Rutgers University, an author of the acclaimed ''broken windows'' theory, which says that the key to fighting crime is to address all offenses, even the seemingly minor ones; otherwise, chaos prevails.</p>
        <p>They were also joined by civic and religious leaders who bluntly laid out the challenges faced by police departments that are often mistrusted by minorities. ''The issue is not whether my relationship with you is a good one,'' Darnell Williams, president of the New England chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the police chiefs, ''but whether the people on the street are being treated respectfully by the people who report to you.''</p>
        <p>While the theater might have seemed like an unlikely setting, the choice of Stamford as the host city of the conference was not. Earlier this year, this racially mixed city of  110,000 became the first municipality in Connecticut, and one of the first in the country, to adopt a strong policy banning racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Several participants said including union heads in the conference was a noteworthy step. ''Unions have to be at the table,'' Mr. Bratton said. ''You can have great police management, but it's the cops on the street who really deliver the services.''</p>
        <p>In the first keynote address, Professor Kelling used the city of Newark to show how complex issues of law enforcement and race can become easily entangled. ''The good news is the Portuguese aren't shooting each other,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, the African-Americans are.</p>
        <p>''If I'm going to go looking for guns, am I going to look in the Ironbound?'' he asked, referring to a predominantly Portuguese neighborhood in Newark. ''Now,'' he asked, ''is that racial profiling or is that good planning?''</p>
        <p>Professor Kelling said the Newark Police Department was working closely with black religious leaders to bridge gaps in trust between their parishioners and the police. Such partnerships became a theme of the conference, as the chiefs and the union representatives broke into discussion groups to discuss strategies for building trust. Some ideas included having community leaders join  officers on patrol and expanding police academy programs to teach residents about law enforcement.</p>
        <p>Vincent DeMaio, the president of the police union in New Canaan, talked about the need to strengthen departments' internal-affairs divisions and make communities aware that departments work diligently to police their own members.</p>
        <p>Stamford's mayor, Dannel P.. Malloy, and its police chief, Dean M. Esserman, have started community-policing strategies, including placing officers in all high schools and middle schools to get to know the city's youth. At night, the officers often visit the homes of students who have missed school repeatedly, and in the summer the Police Department runs a day camp.</p>
        <p>There is also collaboration between the department and local mental health care providers, as well as with the corrections and probation departments. The results are already visible, Mr. Malloy said.</p>
        <p>''I live in a city that is having an absolute love affair with its Police Department,'' he said. ''The dividends of that kind of relationship are unbelievable. We are a raising a whole new generation of people prepared to have a good relationship with their Police Department.''</p>
