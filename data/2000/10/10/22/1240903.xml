        <p>FOUR years ago, Steven Kydd wondered whether an overseas stint for his company was a good career move. It wasn't until earlier this year, after he came back from Hong Kong, that he realized it was.</p>

        <p>FOUR years ago, Steven Kydd wondered whether an overseas stint for his company was a good career move. It wasn't until earlier this year, after he came back from Hong Kong, that he realized it was.</p>
        <p>''My phone was ringing all the time,'' said Mr. Kydd, describing how he was pursued by headhunters for dot-com companies after returning to Los Angeles from a position managing 20th Century Fox's operations in Indonesia and Hong Kong. ''There were so many companies looking to go international, I could almost write my own ticket.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kydd, 31, who also worked in Eastern Europe and Russia in the mid-1990's for Macro International, an emerging-markets consultant, recently accepted a higher-paying position, with stock options, as director of international development for eTour.com, an Atlanta-based company that helps users navigate the Web. He oversees its international operations from its American headquarters.</p>
        <p>The demand for experienced globetrotters like Mr. Kydd is soaring as more companies expand abroad. ''If you've got global skills, you're definitely seen as a hot ticket,'' said Neil S. Orkin, a principal at Global Training Systems, a global management consulting firm in Somerville, N.J. Mr. Orkin said his clients, which include Johnson &amp; Johnson and Coca-Cola, ''actively seek employees who have done business globally.'' And those who accept overseas positions with their companies, he said, often come back to find a spot in the executive suite waiting for them. Others find themselves working their way up the international corporate ladder.</p>
        <p>That was the case for Joan Pattle, a Microsoft marketing manager who worked at the Redmond, Wash., headquarters for three years before accepting a post as product manager for direct marketing in Britain in 1994.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pattle had been in charge of direct marketing in the United States. When she accepted the London post, Mrs. Pattle said, she was given wider responsibilities and a salary increase. ''At home, my job was very strictly defined,'' she said. ''I basically had to know everything about managing a database. But when I got to London, I was also in charge of direct marketing and press relations. I was exposed to a much broader set of experiences.''</p>
        <p>Those experiences paved the way for more promotions. Last year, she worked briefly in Istanbul, managing the company's Middle East and North African marketing divisions. Now she is back in London, managing Microsoft's entire marketing effort in Britain. ''I'm getting to be a really big fish in a relatively small pond here,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But other people who have worked overseas caution that some moves, if not weighed carefully, can be career hindrances instead of steps up the corporate ladder. A main consideration, workplace experts say, is how a company treats executives who head for foreign lands.</p>
        <p>''Some companies just send somebody overseas and forget about them for two years,'' said Tom Schiro, a managing partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche who helps oversee employees who take foreign posts. ''They don't have a clear plan for what the employee will do while he's there.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a recent survey of human resources executives by KPMG showed that only 25 percent of companies had set formal goals for overseas employees.</p>
        <p>Larry Lunetta, a vice president at Branders.com, an Internet company in Foster City, Calif., that sells promotional products like pens and coffee mugs to businesses, said he recently worked for a high-technology company that sent a colleague to Germany to manage its European division. ''All the decisions about money and other resources were made here, and she was left out of the loop,'' Mr. Lunetta said. As a result, he added, ''she had to fight tooth and nail for everything.''</p>
        <p>EXECUTIVES who go overseas sometimes find themselves cut out of the inner-office networking circle. When Mr. Kydd was in Russia, he struggled with the fact that, because of the time difference, he had only a few hours a day to communicate with senior executives stateside. ''That detachment can be debilitating,'' he said. ''When new jobs come up, your colleagues are sitting there in front of the top brass's faces, and you're off in never-never land.''</p>
        <p>There is also the potential for overseas employees to lose touch with business trends back home. Mr. Kydd said that while in Indonesia in the late 1990's, he missed out on the beginning of the dot-com boom in the United States.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are also personal considerations. People who have made the overseas leap say life abroad can be isolating, even frightening, especially when there are language barriers.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pattle, 36, says her inability to speak Turkish made her seven-month stint in Istanbul very lonely. ''You can't really mix with the locals,'' she said. ''You can't use local transportation because you can't read any of the signs.''</p>
        <p>And when trouble arises, Mrs. Pattle said, the communication obstacles become worse. She recalled walking out of her apartment one day to find an anti-Kurd demonstration at her doorstep. ''There were hundreds of people in the street and police running around with bulletproof shields,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Taking families overseas poses additional challenges. Employees who receive work permits to go abroad often cannot get similar permits for their spouses because of restrictions imposed by some countries. ''For most people, the fact that their spouses can't work abroad is a deal-breaker, especially if their spouse has a good job in the States,'' said Elizabeth E. Stern, an immigration lawyer for Shaw Pittman in Washington.</p>
        <p>Judith Edstrom, a sector manager for the World Bank in Washington, faced that issue when she accepted a position leading the organization's operations in South Africa from 1996 to 1998. Her husband had to quit his job to accompany her. He eventually found a position as an adviser to the country's minister of agriculture.</p>
        <p>John McNamara, 54, the national director of international assignments for Deloitte &amp; Touche, also worried about how his family would adapt to his position overseas. But for him, the issue was cultural. Not only was his wife, Agate, not allowed to work while his family was in Saudi Arabia, from 1988 to 1999, she was rarely able to leave the small community where the couple and their two sons lived.</p>
        <p>''It was very difficult for her to get used to the societal restrictions on women,'' Mr. McNamara said.</p>
        <p>Another problem looms when the assignment ends: how to readapt to American life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schiro, 46, experienced reverse culture shock when he and his family returned from France in 1995. ''You go through a period where you don't think you fit in anymore,'' he said, adding that he and his wife, Lynn, still long for the authentic French baguettes they used to have every morning.</p>
        <p>Many companies do little to help ease employees back into the daily grind. According to the KPMG survey, 67 percent of the respondents felt that their organizations needed to improve the repatriation process.</p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, many people who have worked overseas say their experience abroad has given them a clear business edge.</p>
        <p>''I can pick up the phone right now and call almost any of our member firms in the world and personally know the managing partner on the other line,'' Mr. McNamara said.</p>
        <p>''That makes me a very special commodity.''</p>
        <p>That Culture Shock May Be Corporate</p>
        <p>Considering an overseas position? Here are some questions to keep in mind, according to experts:</p>
        <p>What's the plan? Make sure that your  employer has a long-range objective for the overseas assignment.</p>
        <p>How are expatriates treated? Inquire about pay, of course, but also ask how the home office communicates with its overseas employees. Do others in the company speak highly of them or see them as outcasts?</p>
        <p>Does the company have a repatriation program? The existence of such a plan shows that the employer values its overseas workers. A good program usually begins several months before employees come home and continues for several months after their return.</p>
