        <p>The Board of Legislators has approved $1.75 million to design and build an 18-hole golf course in New Castle on 174 acres formerly owned by International Business Machines. The course, to be known as Hudson Hills, will be the county's sixth public course. The property had been used as a golf course from 1926 to 1984, when I.B.M. bought it as an office site. But I.B.M. did not build on the land and sold it in 1997 to the county for $3.6 million. The county is still studying whether its Parks Department or a private contractor should operate the course.</p>
