        <p>THE Hudson River Museum sits amid green fields and river views, in a setting as gracious as the Victorian mansion from which it sprung. Until now, however, the river was merely a timeless backdrop, or the subject of paintings that hung on the museum's walls.</p>
        <p>By next summer, however, the Hudson River will be a living presence at the museum, as fully described, illustrated and interpreted -- if the museum's education department fulfills its plans -- as any ecological system can be. The museum has announced a permanent installation called Hudson Riverama, a $1.25 million project expected to open next July.</p>
        <p>''Our hope is that after seeing Riverama, our visitors will not look at the river the same way again,'' said Cathy Shiga-Gatullo, the museum's education director, who spearheaded the project.</p>
        <p>Much of the building's first floor will be devoted to the interactive exhibition, which has been financed largely by a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation and $350,000 in state grants.</p>
        <p>To accommodate the installation of six Hudson River habitats, a river lab and a resource area, several changes are planned. Two large open wells, architecturally distinguished by their balcony views, will be filled in to make room for the 4,575 square feet of exhibition material. In addition, the museum's western wall will be opened to offer a picture-window view of the river and its sunsets, providing a ''portal onto the Palisades,'' as Fred Ellman of Roundtable Design in Tarrytown, the project's design company, put it.</p>
        <p>An environment simulating a journey down the length of the river, from the Adirondacks to New York Harbor, is planned to encircle the Andrus Planetarium (which will be closed for two weeks when construction begins in February). Visitors will pass through habitats like highlands, tidal marsh, sandy bank and developed shore. Ambient sounds, light and video will accompany strollers. A ''touch wall'' in the form of a bas-relief will provide a sensory story without words, Mr. Ellman said, giving information about the flora and fauna comprising the food chain. In addition, the museum plans a ship-to-shore radio to allow visitors to communicate with passing ships.</p>
        <p>The lab area will offer interactive videos, microscopes for viewing marine life and computer stations for recording weather and tidal data.  Demonstrations and other activities will be conducted by a staff of volunteers.</p>
        <p>The expected audience is school groups, families with young children and older adults, Ms. Shiga-Gattullo said.</p>
        <p>She said the museum was not abandoning its artistic focus but, rather, elevating the science program to the level of the art and history programs. A strong environmental mission also underlies the project.</p>
        <p>''One of our goals is to develop a sense of stewardship about the river in our viewers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The announcement was made in a museum gallery showing large watercolors of the river by Don Nice.  John P. Cahill, commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, was among the officials who attended. ''The Hudson River symbolizes the renaissance of an environmental movement in New York State,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Missing from the group was Philip Verre, the former museum director, who left last month to become the deputy director of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. A nationwide search for a new director -- someone who ''can move between disciplines'' -- is under way, Ms. Shiga-Gattullo said.</p>
        <p>The museum, which still has $400,000 to raise for the the exhibition, has been approved for participation in the state's economic development zone tax credit program.  Contributors who give more than $500 for Riverama qualify for a 25 percent tax credit against personal or corporate state income tax. In addition, the contributors may be eligible for a federal and state charitable deduction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellman promised that Riverama would be ''really cool.''</p>
