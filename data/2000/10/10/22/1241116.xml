        <p>It was the first Subway Series contest in 44 years, and the Yankees and the Mets played a game at Yankee Stadium that seemed to last almost that long, a night and an early morning of extra innings and base-running mistakes, heart-pounding comebacks and blown rallies.</p>
        <p>But the longest game in terms of time in World Series history finally ended this morning after 4 hours 51 minutes, when Jose Vizcaino -- the 101st batter of the game -- singled home Tino Martinez with two outs and the bases loaded in the bottom of the 12th. Martinez crossed the plate at 1:04, giving the Yankees a 4-3 victory.</p>

        <p>It was the first Subway Series contest in 44 years, and the Yankees and the Mets played a game at Yankee Stadium that seemed to last almost that long, a night and an early morning of extra innings and base-running mistakes, heart-pounding comebacks and blown rallies.</p>
        <p>But the longest game in terms of time in World Series history finally ended this morning after 4 hours 51 minutes, when Jose Vizcaino -- the 101st batter of the game -- singled home Tino Martinez with two outs and the bases loaded in the bottom of the 12th. Martinez crossed the plate at 1:04, giving the Yankees a 4-3 victory.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, who tied this Game 1 in the bottom of the ninth when they scraped out a run against the Mets' closer, Armando Benitez, have won a record 13 consecutive World Series games. Roger Clemens will try to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series tonight when he pitches against the Mets' Mike Hampton.</p>
        <p>''We came with very little World Series experience, and we got a lot of it in one night,'' said Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager.</p>
        <p>The Mets came within three outs of winning, of seizing the advantage early in this series. The left-hander Al Leiter pitched exceptionally for seven innings. The Mets had scored three runs in the top of the seventh, two on a single by the pinch-hitter Bubba Trammell, after the Yankees scored two in the bottom of the sixth. It looked as if the Mets were going to overcome a base-running blunder by Timo Perez, who was thrown out at the plate for the final out of the sixth inning after slowing down on the bases because he thought Todd Zeile's smash to left field was going to be a home run. Zeile's ball hit the top of the wall and stayed in play, and the Mets got nothing for it.</p>
        <p>Benitez strolled to the mound for the bottom of the ninth, 6 feet 4 inches and 250 pounds, a huge presence making his World Series debut.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill came to bat with one out, his bat speed slowed at age 37, and he fought to keep up with Benitez's fastball. O'Neill fouled off one pitch after another, always to the left side of the field with defensive swings, and slowly, the ball-strike count turned in his favor. On the 10th pitch of the at-bat, O'Neill drew a walk. Valentine later deflected questions about Benitez's control by crediting O'Neill: ''He did a good job of hitting.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, agreed: ''It was amazing, really.''</p>
        <p>Scott Brosius was due to bat, but Luis Polonia was inserted as a pinch-hitter. On Friday, Polonia sat at his locker and talked about this very situation. He knew he was going to face Benitez, he said. Polonia faced Benitez for years in winter ball in the Dominican Republic, and he felt that he knew how Benitez thinks. Polonia rifled a single to right field. Vizcaino was due to hit, and Torre eschewed the possible pinch-hitters Jose Canseco and Glenallen Hill because he wanted someone who had a better chance of putting the ball in play.</p>
        <p>Vizcaino slapped a single to left, the crowd roaring when the ball landed. O'Neill pulled into third and stopped leaving the bases loaded, one out. Under duress, the Yankees were reverting to form, taking at-bats pitch to pitch.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch smashed a high fly ball to left field, where Joe McEwing retreated. But as soon as the ball went in the air, the 55,913 fans realized it was deep enough for O'Neill to tag up and score.</p>
        <p>But the winning run would elude the Yankees repeatedly. They had runners at second and third and nobody out in the bottom of the 10th, the winning run only 90 feet from home. The Mets' infielders and outfielders moved in, and when Martinez looped a ball into shallow left field, McEwing rushed in and caught the pop only 20 feet or so from the infield for the first out of the inning.</p>
        <p>The Mets left-hander Glendon Rusch, who was inserted into the game after Dennis Cook issued two walks to start the inning, intentionally walked Jorge Posada to fill the bases and create a force at every base. Mets fans were chanting, Yankees fans answering.</p>
        <p>O'Neill chopped a grounder up the middle, and second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo fielded the ball and flipped to second to start an inning-ending double play that sucked the air from the lungs of Yankees fans. The Mets had a reprieve, and several came spilling from the dugout to greet Rusch and his fielders.</p>
        <p>The Yankees threatened again in the 11th, putting runners at second and third with two outs. But the pinch-hitting Hill popped up against Mets reliever Turk Wendell, Yankees fans groaning again. It was past midnight; the game that started on Oct. 21 would end Oct. 22. The Yankees bullpen had pinned down the Mets, Mariano Rivera pitching the 9th and 10th innings, Mike Stanton shutting them out in the 11th and 12th.</p>
        <p>Martinez, who flubbed one chance in the 10th, singled off Wendell with one out in the 12th. Posada then smashed a liner past Alfonzo, the ball rolling against the grain of the defense, going between the outfielders for a double, Martinez stopping at third.</p>
        <p>O'Neill was intentionally walked, the infielders and outfielders moved in, and Luis Sojo fouled out. There were two outs, and Vizcaino was next.</p>
        <p>He had been a spare-part acquisition by the Yankees in June, acquired after second baseman Chuck Knoblauch's throwing problems had gone into full bloom. Brian Cashman, the Yankees general manager, traded the veteran Jim Leyritz for him, and Vizcaino played regularly for the next six weeks.</p>
        <p>But when the Yankees signed Sojo in August, Vizcaino's playing time was reduced to almost nothing. Sojo started every game at second base in the first two rounds of the playoffs, and when Torre announced that Vizcaino would start in Game 1 of the World Series, it was a surprise. Torre picked him because of his .526 career average against Leiter, the Mets' starter.</p>
        <p>But as the game progressed, Torre had decided against pinch-hitting for him a couple of times, and now Vizcaino was batting in the 12th inning, the winning run 90 feet away, against Wendell.</p>
        <p>''I was really very comfortable,'' Vizcaino said. ''I was just looking to put the ball in play.''</p>
        <p>Wendell threw a fastball outside, the 396th pitch of the game, trying to get ahead in the count, and Vizcaino -- batting left-handed -- sprayed the ball to the opposite field. There was no question, once it left his bat, that he had just won the game.</p>
        <p>The fans rose, exploded, and as Martinez raced down the third-base line, Vizcaino leapt into the air once, pumped a fist, hit first base. Derek Jeter was among the first to reach him, hugging him, and others followed, pounding him on the back after the longest Series game since the Yankees and the Atlanta Braves needed 4:17 to play Game 4 in 1996.</p>
        <p>''If Viz didn't get that hit,'' Jeter said in the jubilant Yankees' clubhouse, ''we'd probably be out there another couple of hours.''</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, was beaming. ''We've been through a whole bunch of nerve-racking games,'' he said. ''These guys have the heart of a lion.''</p>
        <p>Valentine seemed tense at the postgame news conference, tapping an index finger, and understandably. The Mets came so close to getting ahead, but now they are in the same position as the '98 Padres and the '99 Braves, trying to hold back champions who have proven to be so tough in October.</p>
