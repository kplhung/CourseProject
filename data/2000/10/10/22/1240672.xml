        <p>Poor Rabbit Angstrom -- he's missing out. In 1990, his creator, John Updike, killed him off at the premature age of 56 (two years younger than Updike at the time), curtailing an eager, questing life that had spanned four novels and as many decades. The message seemed to be that vitality belonged to the next generation -- to characters like Rabbit's daughter-in-law, Pru, with whom he guiltily enjoyed a quickie not long before he died. But now Rabbit is back -- at least, as a spectral presence -- in the novella ''Rabbit Remembered'' (due out next month), and a lot has happened in his absence. On the one hand, his children -- Nelson, the former cokehead, and Annabelle, his illegitimate daughter -- have turned out better than expected. On the other, Rabbit's widow, Janice, has married, of all people, the crude and angry Ronnie Harrison, Rabbit's old teammate and nemesis. Though now in their 60's, they have, we are clearly given to understand, a more than satisfactory sex life: Ronnie is easily Rabbit's match in the lovemaking department, and Janice boasts to herself about her frequent orgasms. At one point the 42-year-old Nelson, now separated and living at home and reduced to fantasizing about television actresses, comes upon Ronnie copping a feel in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Another fictional oldster who's still sexually active is the ironically named Chick, the aging narrator of Saul Bellow's recent novel, ''Ravelstein.'' Though not yet the father of an infant daughter, Chick otherwise closely resembles his 85-year-old creator; having extricated himself from a marriage gone cold and survived a brush with death, he has found comfort and understanding in the arms of a much younger woman. Meanwhile, in yet another part of the fictional landscape, the durable 60-something Nathan Zuckerman bears roughly the same relation to his creator, Philip Roth, that Rabbit does to Updike. Nathan's not having a lot of sex these days -- he has had prostate surgery, poor guy. But in ''The Human Stain'' he's otherwise undiminished, and in many ways more at peace than he has been in years. He also takes a more than passing interest in the love life of his 71-year-old friend Coleman Silk, who he discovers to be having an affair with a young woman who works as a custodian.</p>

        <p>What's going on? These three authors, the once mighty phallocrats of American letters, were supposed to be past it by now -- packed off, by writers and critics like Dave Eggers and Sven Birkerts, to the rest home and the remainder table -- and here they are, not only still writing well but giving us characters of a certain age who, like their authors, refuse to get off the page. It's not just a male phenomenon either. Margaret Atwood's new novel, ''The Blind Assassin,'' has a narrator almost as old as Bellow's; Iris Chase Griffen is frail and occasionally cranky, but she's in full possession of her marbles and still warm with the memory of a lover whom she daringly concealed from everyone.</p>
        <p>None of this should come as a surprise, really. Novels, and realistic novels especially, are supposed to tell us about ourselves, and we are, as the experts keep reminding us, a graying population. We live longer, we enjoy better health and at middle age we, like the people in these novels, are unwilling to exit gracefully from the stage. We still want the starring roles, not just the character parts -- the ones for the colorful old duffers. We want health care and prescription benefits, and we want to remain the protagonists of our own narratives.</p>
        <p>The great novelistic theme in America used to be one of self-discovery and coming-of-age; and though there are exceptions (think of Wright Morris or Wallace Stegner or Eudora Welty), the paradigmatic novelistic career, not coincidentally, was one that, like Fitzgerald's or Hemingway's, blazed early and then fell into premature decline. Now that we've come of age as a nation, we're seeing a new kind of novel -- the one by and for survivors. It's narrower and more anxious than its predecessors, and nowhere near as noble and romantic. It's also much more honest, especially about the pleasures and discontents of maturity. In the past, when a middle-aged character acted on a sexual impulse, as Hurstwood did in ''Sister Carrie,'' abandoning his family to chase an actress, it was sure to end badly. Except for out-and-out lovers, grown-up characters in our novels used to be like our parents; whatever they were up to, we didn't want to know.</p>
        <p>If Updike, Roth, Bellow, et al. have begun to peek into that most forbidden of chambers, the parental and even, God forbid, the grandparental bedroom, it's in part because we've given them license. Bob Dole and the Viagra folks left the door open. And the news is not as embarrassing as we thought. Old people, to judge by these books, have love lives like everyone else's: sexy, complicated, full of yearning and misgivings. What's touching, though, is that these characters seem surprised themselves by the extended lives they've been granted, and a little unsure of what to make of them. Breathing through these books is a whiff, sharp as wood smoke, of mortality and impending darkness, but even that proves not unwelcome. A story that gave no hint of ending would be no fun at all.</p>
