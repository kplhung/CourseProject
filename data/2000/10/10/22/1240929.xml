        <p>THE instructions for refrigerator soup should have been the tip-off:</p>
        <p>''Just open your refrigerator door, pull out leftovers, any vegetables from the bin, dibs and dabs of rice or squash, meat or chicken cut in bite-sized pieces and put it all in a saucepan and add water and some beef or chicken bouillon. Then season with your favorite spices and simmer for a few minutes. Your family won't even recognize those leftovers!''</p>
        <p>They won't? Kids in New York know the difference between tuna and toro sushi; does anyone think they couldn't identify last night's meatloaf floating in the soup?</p>
        <p>Perhaps only Heloise, that American icon of household wisdom, could get away with directions like these. But ''In the Kitchen With Heloise'' (Perigee Books) is her ninth book; the first eight sold 5.5 million copies (which goes to show that New York City has never been and never will be an American city). Heloise also writes the syndicated Hints From Heloise column that started in 1959 and is published daily in 500 newspapers in 20 countries.</p>
        <p>But be advised: since the original Heloise died in 1977, the Heloise in charge has been her daughter, Ponce Heloise Cruse, 49, who lives in San Antonio with her husband, David Evans, a plumbing contractor. She has grown the franchise past the era of the housewife to encompass the house husband, the working mother and the latchkey child, all of whom write the 2,000 to 3,000 letters, faxes and e-mails to Heloise each week. Heloise Inc. employs 11 people, and its brisk, no-nonsense leader shuns ''Ms. Cruse'' in favor of just plain Heloise. In fact, that's all her American Express card says. Her license plate says HINTS.</p>
        <p>Last week, Heloise came to New York, where we met in the test kitchen of the Good Housekeeping Institute; she writes a monthly column for its magazine. She planned on making a few recipes and on talking about the hints that remain the backbone of her books and columns.</p>
        <p>As she barreled into the room with publicists and employees in tow, I must say, I had a heart-sinking moment. I grew up reading Heloise, I still read Heloise in Good Housekeeping (though I live in New York, I like to pretend I live in America) and somehow that resourceful soul who seems to cherish 101 ways to use vinegar more than life itself did not jibe with the hard-boiled Texas babe dressed in red, snapping commands to the troops. This Heloise wore four strands of pearls and a Spiderman watch. Huh? ''When I'm giving speeches I can check it and it doesn't look like I am,'' she said crisply. She seemed to be coated in some sort of nonstick spray -- for humans.</p>
        <p>The idea of even broaching the latest in hip New York housekeeping trends seemed absurd. This is not a woman to revere the $999 Miele vacuum cleaners that are rich people's most recent gimme. For all of Heloise's bluster, she is the real thing; the child of Depression-era parents, she wastes nothing, even lamenting the lack of a dish towel in her corner of the test kitchen; using so much paper seems wasteful to her.</p>
        <p>While New Yorkers pay lip service to the romance of retro, paying $7 for an order of mashed potatoes in a restaurant, or $95 for a dustpan from Williams-Sonoma, Heloise -- for better or worse -- is retro incarnate. One of her hints for roasting a turkey is to slather it in mayonnaise and cook it under an aluminum foil tent. She swears it comes out moist and golden brown. Then there's her Chocolate Sauerkraut Surprise Cake. Could you imagine the proud Park Avenue owner of an Italian-made squeegee from Restoration Hardware whipping that up -- after Pilates? ''The sauerkraut makes it moist, almost like brownies,'' Heloise insisted. Sure it does. But life has enough surprises, doesn't it?</p>
        <p>Still, the instinct to own the fancy vacuum cleaner and the instinct to save money on Windex by combining vinegar and water are actually the same; it's the execution (and the pocketbook) that are different. But that's also why Heloise has thrived. The idea of home as a refuge cuts across all economic lines, and the idea of an uber-mommy who knows everything about stain removal and nothing about you has universal appeal. When I read Heloise, I either think, yes, what a great idea (to increase kitchen counter space, work on a cookie sheet that's been fitted into an open drawer), or I think, no, life is too short (to prevent an electric mixer from spattering, fit a shower cap over the bowl with a hole cut in it for the beaters).</p>
        <p>''The point of the books and the columns is that I can't be all things to all people,'' Heloise said. ''There are probably hints in this book I might think are silly, but when I get 50 or 100 letters about it, I have to address it without being condescending.''</p>
        <p>In the Good Housekeeping kitchen, she examined the ingredients for her recipes and immediately spotted errors. Since her personal staff had already left, she tapped her inner Southern belle instead.</p>
        <p>''We're going to punt,'' she drawled in a suddenly syrupy accent. As she bustled about, trying to find a knife and to tame a persnickety gas burner, her voice rose to a girlish pitch, her fury funneling itself into innocent-sounding questions, flung at the other women in white coats who seemed stunned by this red tornado. When she trilled, ''Do you all have a knife?'' they came running. ''Do you want an apron?'' one asked tentatively. ''No thanks,'' she said brusquely, back to business. ''I figure I can get the stain out.''</p>
        <p>Her goal, to prepare four dishes, seemed suddenly preposterous. Even for Heloise, it's hard to cook in someone else's kitchen, so we settled on two: Bootleg Beans a la Heloise, her mom's recipe from the 1950's, which was a can of Campbell's pork and beans doctored with bacon, onion, ketchup and brown sugar; and Salmonettes, from the 1960's, which was a concoction of canned salmon, eggs and baking powder, measured out in iced tea spoons she brought from home, and deep fried.</p>
        <p>''I do a chat on women.com on the first Thursday of every month,'' she said, frying an onion in bacon fat, ''and the twenty-somethings from New York all love it. They say their moms worked and didn't have time to teach them, but one admitted, 'If she did, I don't think I listened.' That's really the point.''</p>
        <p>For Heloise, not listening to her own mother was never an option. Eloise Cruse was the wife of an Air Force lieutenant colonel stationed in Honolulu, when she got the idea to write a household hints column for the local newspaper. A general on base assured her she couldn't; she was, after all, only a housewife.</p>
        <p>The housewife went to the Honolulu Advertiser, anyway, and offered the column free on a trial basis (the  ''H'' was added to Eloise only after the column was syndicated, so it would sound better with ''hints''); when she offered a pamphlet on laundry and received 100,000 self-addressed envelopes, they knew she had a hit.</p>
        <p>''Mother was a piece of work,'' Heloise said simply. ''She would buy theatrical hair spray in sapphire blue or emerald green and spray her hair to match her outfits. On a plane recently, I met a man who was stationed in Virginia when my parents were. L. B. J. was in office then, and he threw a party for Texans in the area at the White House. She had sprayed her hair blue and he said, 'Your mother walked in and everybody's mouth fell open, including the president's.' I said, 'Well, you remember her, don't you?' ''</p>
        <p>Her parents divorced in 1968; her mother's family had a history of heart disease and she was a heavy smoker. She was 58 when she died. Her tombstone reads ''Every Housewife's Friend.''</p>
        <p>''Her hint to me was: 'You're here for a short time. Make the most of it,' '' her daughter said. For her that has meant expanding the column to include hints on home offices, composting and CD storage, keeping up smartly with the times while never forsaking the classic concerns.</p>
        <p>But after sampling her recipes, I vote to update Heloise in the kitchen, too. The salmonettes tasted like fishy croutons, and the beans didn't cook long enough for the extra ingredients to do their work.</p>
        <p>Still, there are plenty of people who adore Heloise's cooking; after her mother died, some readers mailed her their own collections of Heloise recipes. ''They thought I'd like to see them and I should send them back when I was done,'' she said. ''It was touching. They also wrote to say that when their own relatives died, they would find Hints From Heloise tucked into the pages of their Bibles, like messages from the past.''</p>
        <p>She smiled gently. And for the first time that afternoon, it seemed as if the nonstick spray might finally wear off.</p>
