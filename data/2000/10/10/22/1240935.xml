        <p>AS president of Liberty Cable, Peter O. Price spent five years in the 1990's waging a David-and-Goliath battle against Time Warner for cable television customers in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Price never signed up more than 34,000 customers. But in 1996, he and the Milstein real estate family in New York were able to sell the company to the RCN Corporation for close to $100 million.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Andrew L. Farkas, chairman of the Insignia Financial Group, one of the nation's largest real estate management companies, enlisted Mr. Price to jump again into the breach, as chief executive of its Internet venture, EdificeRex. This time, Mr. Price is engaged in more of a David-versus-David battle to be among the portals or service providers that transform a technology-averse real estate industry and, more important, make money at it.</p>
        <p>The Internet is already crowded with real estate ventures and littered with those who have failed. ''This is not for the faint-hearted,'' said Mr. Price, a former publisher of  The New York Post. ''It doesn't light up overnight.''</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Price will start RexOffice, an Internet portal that joins two other EdificeRex businesses, both of which cater to residential buildings in Manhattan. Offered free to landlords, RexOffice will let tenants set up customized Intranets for their employees, providing local weather, traffic reports, company notices and building information. Office managers can make maintenance requests, review leasing information and join with other tenants to buy supplies, water and food at discounts.</p>
        <p>''The real estate industry as a whole has been technologically retarded,'' he said. ''What we're trying to do is provide a building operating system which creates a smart office as well as a smart building -- does it for free and doesn't require any wires.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Price's expensive blue Edwardian suits are in contrast with the more technology-friendly, khaki-and-denim couture of Tom Bogle, the company's chief operating officer. But it is Mr. Price who is out selling the concept to landlords and management companies. He said he had contracts to serve 42 million square feet of office space in New York, or more than 10 percent of the Manhattan market. He said he expected that figure to jump to 100 million square feet within six months. Next year, the company plans to offer RexOffice in two other cities, probably Washington and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>RexOffice plans to make money by charging a commission on purchases and offering sponsorships for various parts of its site. ''I suspect we'll break even in the second year,'' Mr. Price said.</p>
        <p>EdificeRex has already established a residential portal, RexHome, which allows tenants of upscale buildings in Manhattan to receive news, weather reports and building information and to make restaurant reservations and buy theater tickets. Then there is RexSpeed, a broadband Internet service  provider for residential buildings.</p>
        <p>Insignia poured $7 million into EdificeRex before raising an additional $36 million in March from 20 investors, including property owners like Apollo Real Estate Advisors, the Witkoff Group, Blackacre Capital Management and Milford Management, which is owned by Mr. Price's former partners, the Milstein real estate family. Insignia now has a 47 percent stake in the company, which, based on what other investors paid, it values at a total of $265 million.</p>
        <p>Like his counterparts at other real estate companies, Mr. Farkas has more than one technology bet. Insignia has invested $25 million in its own Internet ventures and $17 million in 17 other Web companies, including LoopNet, OnSite Access and Concrete Inc. And just like the other real estate companies, for now Insignia has found start-up costs high and profits elusive.</p>
        <p>IN August, Insignia announced that second-quarter income had dropped 9 percent because of losses related to the company's Internet businesses. But with its  voting stake in EdificeRex now at less than 50 percent, it no longer has to include the losses in Insignia's statements.</p>
        <p>Still, investors have not embraced Mr. Farkas's Internet strategy. Insignia's stock is languishing, closing on Friday at $10, down from $16.63 in February. ''Wall Street does not particularly care for the real estate services sector as a whole,'' Mr. Farkas said. ''Wall Street's perception is that it's much ado about nothing.''</p>
        <p>Initially, many an Internet real estate venture saw itself as ''the'' portal for real estate. But after years of losses and difficulty attracting users, many have set more modest goals or have disappeared.</p>
        <p>''It's tough to be all things to all people,'' said Heather Shively, chief executive of CapitalThinking, which recently closed its mortgage transaction business, which  linked borrowers to lenders online without brokers. The company has decided instead  to license its technology directly to lenders and brokers, like J. P. Morgan Mortgage Capital.</p>
        <p>Bruce Weissberg, chief executive of RealtyIQ.com, which once planned to become a center of online real estate services, has also scaled back his ambitions. The company now sells data on 200,000 properties in 52 cities.</p>
        <p>Zethus Inc., an Internet company backed by Goldman Sachs, originally intended to displace commercial real estate brokers by letting landlords and tenants deal directly over the Web. But in June, Zethus formed a joint venture with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the real estate broker, acknowledging that its technology might make deals more efficient but not displace brokers altogether.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farkas contends that RexOffice is offering something different to landlords, managers and office workers. He said that other Internet companies have some of the same individual services, but that RexOffice brought them under one roof. ''It creates a community between and amongst a series of constituencies,'' Mr. Farkas said, ''whose day-to-day lives are inexorably intertwined but whose level of communication is not necessarily as great as it could be.''</p>
        <p>Will Marks, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said real estate companies must develop Internet services if only to hold onto clients and extend brand names.  ''It's a good idea and necessary,'' Mr. Marks said of EdificeRex. ''It may not enhance the revenue line of their balance sheet, and it could impact the cost line. But I expect some of these services are going to make them a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farkas and Mr. Price said their venture would be profitable. But developing content -- restaurant reviews, for example, or building information -- is expensive, especially when it is given away. With revenue coming instead from sponsorships and commissions, their challenge has been to persuade building managers, tenants and brokers to use the services that generate fees.</p>
        <p>So far, residential tenants have yet to generate significant traffic at EdificeRex.com, according to Media Metrix Inc., a digital and Internet measurement company.  ''The challenge is adoption,'' Mr. Weissberg said. ''It can be very slow.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Price's services appear to be making some headway with New York's major landlords. One of them, Douglas Durst, said he had signed with RexOffice to serve about two million square feet of offices operated by his Durst Organization. The tenants are RexOffice's ideal audience: small companies that lack their own Intranet system or technology managers.</p>
        <p>''We like it because it provides a service to our tenants, and by aggregating purchases, it may cut down on traffic in our buildings,'' Mr. Durst said. ''Tenants may not be able to get it all somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>David J. Wine, president of the Related Management Corporation, said it had introduced RexHome to about 10 rental buildings in Manhattan with nearly 4,000 apartments. ''We think it has the potential to offer a real service to our residents,'' he said. ''We'll add new buildings as they're completed.''</p>
        <p>But a major commercial landlord who requested anonymity shrugged off a recent presentation by Mr. Price. Several companies already sell customized management services or procurement software for landlords, this landlord said. But, he added, tenants will resist buying goods through their landlords, for fear of not getting the best deals, while office workers will use more traditional Web portals.</p>
        <p>''Why would a tenant want to use a portal offered by a landlord, as opposed to AOL or Yahoo?'' he asked. ''What value are they adding?''</p>
