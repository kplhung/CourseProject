        <p>MALCOLM S. FORBES, who was known for collecting Faberge eggs and throwing tented parties in Morocco, was not an understated man. One might expect the wedding of his granddaughter Roberta Aimee Forbes to take place on a family-owned Fiji island with private jets ferrying guests in.</p>
        <p>But friends describe Ms. Forbes, 27, as self-effacing and modest. She rarely wears makeup, even though she works in Manhattan as a skin-care marketing manager for Chanel. She returns calls quickly and seems genuinely surprised anyone would be interested in her. ''She's a little shy,'' said Sabina Forbes, her twin sister. ''She's very funny and smart, but she doesn't need the limelight. She has her dear friends and her family and she's appreciative of that.''</p>

        <p>MALCOLM S. FORBES, who was known for collecting Faberge eggs and throwing tented parties in Morocco, was not an understated man. One might expect the wedding of his granddaughter Roberta Aimee Forbes to take place on a family-owned Fiji island with private jets ferrying guests in.</p>
        <p>But friends describe Ms. Forbes, 27, as self-effacing and modest. She rarely wears makeup, even though she works in Manhattan as a skin-care marketing manager for Chanel. She returns calls quickly and seems genuinely surprised anyone would be interested in her. ''She's a little shy,'' said Sabina Forbes, her twin sister. ''She's very funny and smart, but she doesn't need the limelight. She has her dear friends and her family and she's appreciative of that.''</p>
        <p>The twins and their three sisters grew up on a farm in Bedminster, N.J., with their father, Steve Forbes, later the editor in chief of Forbes magazine and candidate for president, and mother, Sabina Forbes, a formidable, hands-on woman who drove tractors, did all the household cooking and forbade her daughters to pierce their ears before age 18.</p>
        <p>Sensible and wholesome, the five sisters all seem like characters out of a Jane Austen novel rather than the ''it'' girls found in one by Candace Bushnell. ''They're kind, warm, sweet, outgoing girls, really down-to-earth, very approachable,'' said Deborah Curry, a guest at the wedding.</p>
        <p>Roberta Forbes started dating Michael Jonathan Warren, also 27, when they were juniors at Brown University. While in her family someone was always breaking a bone, bringing home an injured animal or searching frantically for a missing dress, the atmosphere was quieter in his small, academic setting. He is the only child of Dr. David Hardy Warren, the executive vice chancellor of the University of California at Riverside, and Dr. Lynda Walker Warren, a psychologist, who also lives and works in Riverside.</p>
        <p>Now an associate at Palladium Equity Partners, a small Manhattan firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, Mr. Warren is as modest as Ms. Forbes. Even his sentences are spare and logical.</p>
        <p>''The night I met him, he and his five suite mates wanted to go someplace in Massachusetts to buy a 'Space Invaders' game,'' said Ms. Forbes, who drives a Subaru wagon. ''They needed a ride, and I was like, 'Sure, I'd be glad to take six guys anywhere!' Mike was very quiet. I thought he was laid back, but he's actually very intense. He has a boyish, charming grin, like my father's. It was love at first sight.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Forbes, known for loving dogs, mystery books and art history, could soon be found at Brown's varsity water-polo games cheering on Mr. Warren, who played goalie. ''My parents were thinking, 'Oh, my God, she's dating a jock, what a joke!' '' she remembered. ''It's not like we're known for our athleticism.''</p>
        <p>The couple were married on Oct. 14 at St. John on the Mountain, a small stone church in Bernardsville, N.J., that is practically hidden by trees, many with leaves the color of tropical drinks. The only decorations were a few pumpkins outside and two arrangements of spider mums inside, the sort of sweet bouquets that probably sell well on Secretary's Day.</p>
        <p>After the Episcopal ceremony, guests drove a few miles to Malcolm Forbes's former estate, Timberfield, still owned by the Forbes family and decorated with well-worn rugs, antiques and family portraits and battle scenes in gilded frames. It is clearly a place where dogs and children aren't chased off the furniture.</p>
        <p>Similarly, there was nothing precious or fussy about the dinner tent decorations: guests entered on a lumpy AstroTurf floor and sat at tables where the simple arrangements of local flowers didn't interfere with anyone's sightline.</p>
        <p>''Roberta and Mike set the tone for the wedding,'' said Steve Forbes, who spent about $70 million on his two presidential bids. ''It reflects our belief that the wedding is about them and shouldn't be overshadowed by baubles or humongous arrays.''</p>
