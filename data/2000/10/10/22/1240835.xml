        <p>It might look like a stranded parking garage, but the concrete wedding cake rising from the industrial plain in west Newark is expected to be the first link between the railroad lines that snake through the state and the New York area airports.</p>
        <p>While convenient rail connections are a feature of most large airports in Europe -- and many in the United States -- New York's three airports have long scorned the rails, requiring passengers to drive and park in an increasingly Byzantine series of lots.</p>
        <p>Newark International Airport cracked the mold in the spring of 1996 with a new parking-lot monorail, but soon the tiny train had problems of its own. Cold weather caused stalls and breakdowns. In fact, the monorail is now down for several months while engineers solve that problem.</p>
        <p>It is no secret that the Port Authority has had problems with the monorail, but officials say they have spent months reviewing past breakdowns to try to ensure that the same glitches do not surface in the costly addition.</p>
        <p>''Some wrench will always get thrown in your gears,'' said James Blackmore, who is heading the project for the Port Authority. ''However, we have mitigated the possibility of what can go wrong addressing what went wrong in the past. The point was to improve ourselves on things we knew we could do better.''</p>
        <p>The new station rising like some Gatsbyesque vision from the sea of reeds promises to be a dramatic leap, a gateway unleashing the Newark airport monorail on the wider world. Airport planners say that by the summer or fall of 2001, passengers will be able to board trains in New York, Newark, or even Boston, step off onto the monorail extension, and continue right to the airline terminal.</p>
        <p>''We have been talking about rail access to the airports forever,'' said Jeff Zupan, a senior planner with Regional Plan Associates. ''The fact that Newark is getting it within a year or so is great news.''</p>
        <p>The new connection -- a joint project of the city of Newark, Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- is expected to cost a total of $415 million for the terminal, track and six new trains and will be financed by Port Authority bonds and the portion of airline tickets that are dedicated to airport improvements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blackmore said that when the new connection opened, passengers on New Jersey Transit trains will be able to step off at the airport station -- just west of Penn Station in Newark -- cross a short concourse and board a monorail for the airport terminals.</p>
        <p>''We are making provisions for ticketing and baggage checking to be available out there as well,'' Mr. Blackmore said.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, he said, designers want passengers to be able to check in with airlines and drop their bags at the monorail station, which will be open 24 hours a day, though he said this would not be available for at least a year.</p>
        <p>The authority and New Jersey Transit are also negotiating whether passengers would have to pay to use the monorail, and whether the cost would simply be added to the price of the train ticket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blackmore said a monorail would leave the new station every two and a half minutes during peak hours, and that the trip to the airport's three terminals would take about 10 minutes. A spokesman for New Jersey Transit estimated that the ride from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan to the airport terminals would take less than 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey A. Warsh, executive director of New Jersey Transit, said that about 80 percent of the new riders were expected to come from New York City, the vast majority business travelers with a limited amount of baggage.</p>
        <p>''We are not expecting people to use this to take the kids to Disney World for a week,'' Mr. Warsh said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Sharpe James said in a recent interview that he had been advocating the rail link since 1972, when he was a city councilman.</p>
        <p>In addition to the convenience, Mr. James said the new station would decrease traffic to the airport and increase the city's attractiveness as a business conference location. The mayor has also proposed a $150 million hotel and conference center for the site, though he said the project was still under negotiations.</p>
        <p>The Newark airport station is the first step in the Port Authority's plan to connect rail lines to all of New York's major airports. Work is underway on a connection between a Long Island Rail Road station in Jamaica, Queens, and Kennedy International Airport. That rail line is scheduled to open in 2003. The authority is also studying a proposal to link La Guardia Airport with the city subway system.</p>
        <p>Although popular with airline passengers, the monorail at Newark's airport has been riddled with problems since it opened in 1996 at a cost of $354 million. Various troubles, from electrical shorts to brake malfunctions, have caused short-term failures. The most recent repair -- which is expected to cost $25 million and take at least three months -- is the longest and most extensive refit so far. Airport officials closed the monorail after Labor Day to repair the track's de-icing system, which rusted after water leaked through the steel track girders.</p>
        <p>The new extension will increase the total length of the monorail from 1.9 miles -- which circles the three airport terminals and parking lots -- to a total of three miles.</p>
        <p>To a certain extent, New Jersey Transit  has in recent years been victimized by its own success. New services, like the Midtown Direct, which began a little more than four years ago, have brought a crush of new riders, and the allure of the new station will further tax the system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warsh estimated that the railroad's most popular lines, including the one running between New York and Trenton, were already operating at more than 100 percent capacity during rush hour, leaving about 5,000 passengers standing each day and grumbling for the length of the trip.</p>
        <p>He said improvement to the signal system, which will allow more trains to run each hour, is expected to improve the situation. To accommodate the new passengers, New Jersey Transit is having 230 more rail cars and 24 new locomotives built to allow the railroad to lengthen some existing trains and add new trains to the schedule. The railroad also is expected to award contracts for new double-decker rail cars early next year, which will also increase the capacity of trains running into Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Despite these plans, many analysts think there is a limit to what the railroad can do. Experts have questioned how much transit officials can alleviate crowding on the system. Steve Weber, a senior analyst with Regional Plan Associates, said New Jersey Transit had almost reached the limit for the number of trains it can run into Manhattan, as well as the number of cars it can add to existing trains.</p>
        <p>''Barring a new trans-Hudson tunnel, there are few opportunities to reduce crowding,'' said Mr. Weber.</p>
