        <p>Fueling speculation that John Paul II might retire at the end of this year, a Belgian cardinal says he believes that the frail, ailing pope could do exactly that.</p>
        <p>''It would not surprise me if the pope were to retire after 2000,'' Cardinal Godfried Danneels says in a book to be published on Monday in Belgium. ''He wanted at all costs to reach the Jubilee year 2000, but I consider him capable of retiring afterward.''</p>
        <p>Cardinal Danneels is not the first Roman Catholic Church official to broach a topic considered taboo at the Vatican, but he is the highest-ranking leader to address the question so openly. The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, issued a terse reaction, saying ''this is the personal opinion of Cardinal Danneels that we do not confirm.''</p>
        <p>The cardinal spoke in answer to a question in an interview included in his book, ''Frankly Speaking: Six Conversations with the Cardinal.''</p>
        <p>Speculation that John Paul might step down if his health deteriorates to the extent that he cannot fulfill his duties has echoed around the church ever since he turned 75, the mandatory retirement age for bishops, in 1995. The rumors grew louder as the pope visibly weakened and this year passed his 80th birthday, the age at which cardinals become ineligible to vote in a conclave for the next pope.</p>
        <p>In January, Bishop Karl Lehmann, leader of the German Bishops Conference, unleashed a flurry of articles in the Italian press when he told a questioner on German radio that he believed that the pope would resign for the good of the church if he felt he could not fulfill his papal functions.</p>
        <p>The pope, whose speech is slurred and who shakes badly because of a neurological disorder, has nevertheless marshaled his strength to preside over this year's Jubilee, a Holy Year of the church. Once the Holy Year ends on Jan. 6, however, many wonder whether he might retire.</p>
        <p>The pope has not addressed the issue directly, but his few comments on the subject suggest that he is determined to serve out his full term. On his 75th birthday, he told an audience of pilgrims at St. Peter's, referring to God, ''I leave it to him to decide when and how he wants to relieve me of this service.''</p>
        <p>The pope keeps up a full schedule, and the Vatican says he wants to make other important trips in 2001.</p>
        <p>There is no detailed procedure for a papal resignation, and little precedent. The last pope to resign voluntarily was Celestine V in 1294. But canon law does allow a pope to resign, saying it is valid as long as the pope does it freely.</p>
        <p>There are no explicit instructions on how the Vatican should function if a pope had a stroke or went into a coma and could not express his wishes. The Rev. Thomas J. Reese, an American Jesuit who wrote a book on Vatican procedure, ''Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church,'' said, ''The real problem is if the pope can no longer govern, and is incapable of resigning.''</p>
        <p>Some reform-minded Catholics believe that it would be healthier for the church if popes resigned when their health failed. Traditionalists reject all talk of papal resignations, fearful that such a precedent would undermine the special nature of papal authority, which Catholics believe comes directly from God.</p>
