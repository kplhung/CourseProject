        <p>Regina Seltzer has another uphill battle to fight in her First District congressional campaign against Felix J. Grucci [''An Underdog on the East End,'' Oct. 15]: His free name recognition.</p>
        <p>I don't know if it was my imagination, but it seemed to me that every time there was a fireworks display at a public function and there was print  advertising, Fireworks by Grucci was mentioned more prominently than it had been in recent years. I remember something being promoted for Jones Beach this summer, and Firework by Grucci was the second line item and in larger print than the show's headliners and major sponsor.</p>
        <p>I guess when you have such a public name people just get a bit paranoid about how you display it in an election year.</p>
