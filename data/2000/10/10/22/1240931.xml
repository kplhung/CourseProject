        <p>AS Paul A. Blaustein sees it, investing is an evolutionary process, and flexibility is a key to success. He has used that philosophy throughout his 27-year investing career, most recently at the $173.7 million Whitehall Growth fund, which has become a standout among its peers.</p>
        <p>''In the 1970's, the U.S. and world economies weren't growing, so I focused on cyclical stocks,'' Mr. Blau stein said. ''The 1980's were a disinflationary period, so I focused on companies with strong brand names, especially consumer packaged-food businesses.'' In the 1990's, he added, opportunity was based on ''the explosive growth in technology.''</p>

        <p>AS Paul A. Blaustein sees it, investing is an evolutionary process, and flexibility is a key to success. He has used that philosophy throughout his 27-year investing career, most recently at the $173.7 million Whitehall Growth fund, which has become a standout among its peers.</p>
        <p>''In the 1970's, the U.S. and world economies weren't growing, so I focused on cyclical stocks,'' Mr. Blau stein said. ''The 1980's were a disinflationary period, so I focused on companies with strong brand names, especially consumer packaged-food businesses.'' In the 1990's, he added, opportunity was based on ''the explosive growth in technology.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blaustein still likes technology, despite its current volatility. But since he began managing Whitehall Growth two years ago, he has also branched out into other growth areas like health care and financials.</p>
        <p>The fund returned 29.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Sept. 30, compared with 14.4 percent for its peers in the large blend category, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blaustein, 52, looks for growth among American companies with market capitalizations of more than $2 billion. He evaluates each stock as if he were buying the entire business.</p>
        <p>''I want to be a long-term owner of superior businesses that we try to acquire at attractive prices,'' he said from his office in Midtown Manhattan. ''Over time, we should participate as owners in the increase in the valuation of the company's assets.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blaustein does not use computer screens to identify potential purchases. Instead, he keeps a close eye  on 200 to 300 stocks with which he has become familiar during his years at other fund groups, including Legg Mason, Oppenheimer Capital and Warburg Pincus.</p>
        <p>In evaluating a stock, Mr. Blaustein looks for above-average annual growth in the company's sales and earnings, compared with its industry. Under either measure, that generally means gains of 10 to 30 percent or more. He measures profitability by reviewing return on equity or return on capital, as well as profit margins, to establish whether a company is a market leader.</p>
        <p>Finally, he analyzes the sustainability of growth. ''We want to have conviction that the company can sustain its position through various economic and product cycles,'' he said. ''Few companies like Coca-Cola can prosper by selling the same product for 100 years.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Blaustein's view, ''superior businesses'' are companies that have had strong growth and profitability for at least 10 years. Such companies also have a competitive edge, like a proprietary product or service.</p>
        <p>He also likes to talk to a company's customers, suppliers and competitors as well as to market researchers, business consultants and other industry experts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blaustein works with a seven-member investment committee; it meets weekly to vote on possible changes to the 35 to 40 stocks in the portfolio.</p>
        <p>Technology stocks now account for about half of the fund's assets -- a higher-than-usual stake and up from 26 percent two years ago. Mr. Blaustein has been a net seller of tech stocks over that period, so that increase can be attributed to their surge in value.</p>
        <p>HE likes the Altera Corporation in San Jose, Calif., which designs and markets semiconductors. It sells a programmable logic device, or P.L.D., that lets users buy cheap chips and program them rather than investing in custom-designed chips.</p>
        <p>The P.L.D. ''drastically shortens the time to market of a customer's product, which is an enormous advantage to technology companies because prices drop so quickly,'' he said. The market for P.L.D.'s is growing rapidly, he added, as electronic devices become more sophisticated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blaustein expects Altera's sales and earnings to grow 25 to 30 percent a year, on average, over the next three years. He bought shares in August 1998 at $10.12 each. The stock is now at $39.19, or 25 times his earnings forecast of $1.55 a share for next year.</p>
        <p>Another favorite is Cardinal Health Inc., a pharmaceutical services company in Dublin, Ohio. The company's growth rate of roughly 20 percent is driven partly by its fast-growing drug distribution business, he said. It also runs a high-margin  drug dispensing business and has a strong manufacturing operation, he added.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in July 1997 at $36.45; they now trade at $93.63, or 30 times his earnings forecast of $3.10 a share for the fiscal year ending next June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blaustein also likes the Costco Wholesale Corporation, the warehouse club retailer based in Issaquah, Wash. The stock sells at a significant discount to those of retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot because of Costco's shorter track record and smaller base of stores, Mr. Blaustein said. But sales and earnings should grow about 15 percent a year, on average, over the next three years, he said, because the company offers lower prices on higher quality merchandise. Costco has added services like photo processing and pharmacies, he added, and has been expanding into the southern and central regions of the United States.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in January 1995 at $6.88. They now trade at $34.31, or 22 times his earnings forecast of $1.52 a share for the fiscal year ending next August.</p>
