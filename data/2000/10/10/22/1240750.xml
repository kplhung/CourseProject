        <p>AN expressive figurative style and vivid colors are two characteristics that come to mind when one envisions Latin art. What escapes this preconceived notion is a mythical or magical quality, which becomes the central  theme of a new show at the Rye Art Center here, titled ''Introducing Friends and Neighbors: Contemporary Mexican and Cuban Art.''</p>
        <p>All of the Mexican artists represented in this exhibition live and work in Mexico. Maximino Lopez Javier expresses his opinion on excessiveness and gluttony in a gouache painting, titled ''El Rapto de la Gran Gallina'' (''The Kidnapping of the Hen''). In this 1987 work, a well-dressed skeleton prances across an open field, hauling an oversize hen. The hen, and for that matter, the entire painting, is carefully and colorfully rendered. Mr. Javier intensifies the three dimensionality of his work by leaving a tiny bit of unpainted white paper around the edges of the two main subjects, giving it an extra visual punch or liveliness.</p>

        <p>AN expressive figurative style and vivid colors are two characteristics that come to mind when one envisions Latin art. What escapes this preconceived notion is a mythical or magical quality, which becomes the central  theme of a new show at the Rye Art Center here, titled ''Introducing Friends and Neighbors: Contemporary Mexican and Cuban Art.''</p>
        <p>All of the Mexican artists represented in this exhibition live and work in Mexico. Maximino Lopez Javier expresses his opinion on excessiveness and gluttony in a gouache painting, titled ''El Rapto de la Gran Gallina'' (''The Kidnapping of the Hen''). In this 1987 work, a well-dressed skeleton prances across an open field, hauling an oversize hen. The hen, and for that matter, the entire painting, is carefully and colorfully rendered. Mr. Javier intensifies the three dimensionality of his work by leaving a tiny bit of unpainted white paper around the edges of the two main subjects, giving it an extra visual punch or liveliness.</p>
        <p>Francisco Toledo adds a dark side to humor in his two offerings. The watercolor ''Xquenda'' (''The Protector'') (circa 1968), with its overtly child-like renderings, calls to mind the hallucination-based art of the mentally ill. The subject in ''El Hombre de las Pipas'' (''Man With Pipes'') (circa 1970), which looks like one of the many ancillary characters from the 1968 animated film ''Yellow Submarine,'' suggests a drug-induced hallucination.</p>
        <p>The artist who goes by the pseudonym Jazzamoart offers a joined and hinged triptych titled ''Don Giovanni O la Farandula de la Opera'' (''Don Giovanni or the Bohemian Life of the Opera'') . The style of this 1991 painting, which combines Picasso's 1930's brand of Cubism with the painter Giovanni Boldini's emphasis on transparency and movement appears too contrived and forced.</p>
        <p>The winged male figure in Jorge Marin's sculpture titled ''Angel con Libros'' (''Angel With Books'') (1998) stands and stares at and through an orb that seems to be a representation of heaven (a stellar sky on the top half) and earth (a gray-brown coloring on the bottom half). The wonderfully executed details and proportions of the sculpture, and the artist's use of life-like doll eyes, give this piece its powerful presence.</p>
        <p>Some of the works in the exhibition have obvious influences.</p>
        <p>The late Frida Kahlo's painful and all-too-familiar life is represented in the lithographs of Lucia Maya, while the Tomas Pineda Matus paintings carry the color scheme and calming weightlessness of a Paul Klee painting.</p>
        <p>Mario Martin del Campo's ''Gato con Pez'' (''Cat With Fish'') (1998) carries some of the distinctions of Rufino Tamayo's paintings, including his stylized Cubism and an emphasis on skeletal details. Mr. Martin del Campo, however, adds a bit of humor by putting five circular bells at the end of the cat's tail, which should scare away his intended fish dinner.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Mexican artists in this exhibition, who still live in their native country, the Cuban artists represented all live and work in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Geandy Pavon's armed and armored fish in a triptych titled ''The Dream of Nietzsche; Red Sea; The Cure'' (1998) are clearly reminiscent of the combative, fantastical half-man, half-animal figures found in Matthias Grunewald's ''Temptation of St. Anthony'' (1515).</p>
        <p>Like Grunewald, Mr. Pavon finds his muse in the imagined and the exaggerated, as he too paints with an unwavering preference for detail. His subjects, who are eager to sacrifice life and limb for some lofty goal, appear misguided and confused.</p>
        <p>What is clear in the artist's paintings, however, is his disdain for mankind's inability to learn from its past mistakes or atrocities.</p>
        <p>Jesus Rivera's installation, ''Disparando'' (''Shooting'') (1999), seems to echo Mr. Pavon's sentiments regarding violence and oppression.</p>
        <p>''Disparando'' is made up of 12 flame-shape seats encircling a round table. The shape of each seat, when combined with the central circular table, makes a familiar representation of the sun. On one-half of the circular table top, Mr. Rivera depicts concise representations of several earthly desires like food, freedom and sex. On the remaining half, an Egyptian-looking man points and shoots his loaded finger at one of the empty seats, which, when inhabited by some participating person, becomes a casualty in a deadly game of Russian roulette by way of musical chairs.</p>
        <p>The format of Jesus Selgass's 1994 painting ''Alabi VI: El Manto Que Todo lo Cubre'' (''Alabi VI: the Mantle That Covers All'') is similar to that of a standard American playing card.</p>
        <p>One figure, a three-breasted female, is flip-flopped and joined with her twin at midthigh of the right leg, leaving both figures missing right feet and hands to anchor the top and bottom of the composition. Over the faces, and throughout the composition, the artist paints eclipsing or crescent moons, which, when combined with the sacrificial look of the subject, suggest an odd combination of religion and science.</p>
        <p>''Introducing Friends and Neighbors: Contemporary Mexican and Cuban Art'' will remain at the Rye Art Center through Nov. 11. Information: (914) 967-0700.</p>
