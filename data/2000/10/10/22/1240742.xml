        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Now that it has become a ''sport,'' courtesy of the International Olympic Committee, ballroom dancing could appeal to new audiences. Dance fans or sports enthusiasts may want to find their way to the Landmark on Main Street in Port Washington on Saturday at 8 p.m. for ''Feat First: Ballroom Dance, Olympic Style.'' With Pierre Dulaine, the founding director of the American Ballroom Theater, and a master-class format, three prize-winning dance duos will preview the swing, Latin and ballroom dancing that might be included in the 2004 or 2008 Olympics (516) 767-6444.</p>
        <p>Film Previews</p>
        <p>Featuring films that sometimes have not been shown at your neighborhood multiplex, the Great Neck Arts Center opens this year's ''Cinematheque'' series with ''The Yards,'' the James Caan-Mark Wahlberg-Charlize Theron drama set in New York that has been acclaimed on the film festival circuit and opened in general release last week. Sol Negrin, the cinematographer, speaks at the screening at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at the Clearview Squire Cinema on Middle Neck Road (516) 829-2570.</p>

        <p>Keep Talking</p>
        <p>Three women of note rule the talk circuit this week. In free appearances the author Joyce Carol Oates reads from her works at 1 p.m. Tuesday at College Center of Nassau Community College in Garden City (516) 572-7153, while the actress Rita Moreno discusses ''The Lively Arts'' at 12:40 p.m. Wednesday at the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University (631) 632-2787.

        <p>All That Jazz</p>
        <p>Jazz legends make the local scene this week: Dave Brubeck performs at 8 p.m. on Friday at Tilles Center on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville (516) 299-3100, while Herbie Mann and Sona Terra play at 8 p.m. on Saturday at Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University (631) 631-2787.</p>
        <p>Currier and Ives</p>
        <p>When it comes to popular art, the output of the lithographer Nathaniel Currier and the self-trained artist James Merritt Ives is in a class all its own. So the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages has a potential coup with ''Currier and Ives, Printmakers to the American People,'' an exhibition of 72 works drawn from the Museum of the City of New York's Harry T. Peters Collection. The show opens Saturday and runs through Jan. 21 at the Long Island museum's complex on Route 25A in Stony Brook (631) 751-0066.</p>
        <p>Good for a Laugh</p>
        <p>Four programs this week should provide at least a few laughs. Today at 3 p.m., for example, Jackie Mason brings his kind of humor to the Westbury Music Fair on Brushollow Road. That's also where Bill Cosby performs at 8 p.m. on Friday (516) 334-0800. On Saturday at 8 p.m., Chicago City Limits offers its improvisational comedy at the Van Nostrand Theater on the Brentwood campus of Suffolk Community College (631) 851-6589, and Wali Collins and Deb Margolin, comedians, join forces in ''Laugh Out Loud!

        <p>Happy Halloween</p>
        <p>While most of the week's programming marking Halloween has a familiar ring -- you know, plays about witches and walks through spooky sites -- two entries on Saturday break the mold.</p>
        <p>In the season's first ''EAB Family Concert,'' the Long Island Philharmonic offers ''Pumpkinfest Carnival -- A Halloween Extravaganza'' featuring music from ''Phantom of the Opera'' and Dvorak's ''Carnival Overture.''

        <p>At 8 p.m. in Manhasset -- and for adults -- Jon Spelman, a storyteller, offers ''Frankenstein: The Beauty of the Beast.'' It's a theater piece told from the point of the view of the monster. Accompanied by Andy Teirstein, a composer-musician, Mr. Spelman appears at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock on Shelter Rock Road in Manhasset (516) 627-6560.</p>
        <p>Puppy Love</p>
        <p>With two shows on the boards, today is a must-see for puppy lovers.

        <p>Chamber Music Reigns</p>
        <p>With a concert almost every day, chamber music again is where it's at musically on the Island this week. Today there are two: the Miro String Quartet plays works by Bartok, Mendelssohn and Mozart at 4 p.m. at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor (631) 725-9500, while Ridotto, the concert series with a ''touch of theater,'' offers ''Music and the Rose,'' at 4 p.m. at Old First Church on Route 25A in Huntington, with early Baroque music performed by Jolle Greenleaf, soprano; and Philip Anderson, tenor; and lute, strings and harpsichord (516) 385-0373.</p>
        <p>The Long Island String Quartet performs music by Herbert Deutsch, Mozart and Schubert in Hofstra University's ''International Series'' at 8 p.m. Tuesday in the Monroe Lecture Center Theater on the Hempstead campus (516) 463-6644.

Post campus in Brookville (516) 299-3100; Poetica Musica performs ''Golden Prague'' with music by Beethoven, Brahms and Dvorak, at 7:30 p.m. at Old Westbury Gardens' Westbury House (516) 333-0048, and the Long Island Baroque Ensemble plays works by Bach, Boccherini and Haydn in ''Low Notes'' at 8 p.m. at St. Andrews Lutheran Church in Smithtown, repeating the concert at 3 p.m. next Sunday at Christ Episcopal Church in Oyster Bay (631) 724-7386.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY: To mark its change of name, the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages on Route 25A in Stony Brook, which used to be the Museums at Stony Brook, offers a ''Meet the Museum'' free admission day from 1 to 4 p.m. (631) 751-0066.</p>
