        <p>Stephen Wilkes photographs of Times Square document some seldom-seen corners of what Guy Debord once called the spectacular system -- the conversion of the public into consumers of banal visual experience. In the late 20th century, the spectacular system became increasingly decentralized. Television, superhighways, suburban malls and multiplexes displaced city streets as channels for communication. Eventually, however, the systems specialists came to realize that there should be the occasional urban center, in the traditional manner of 19th-century industrial cities. These have now been deployed around the globe. Planners call them social condensers. They are designed to give consumers the impression that there still exist places where they can sample the fragrant atmosphere of cosmopolitan freedom, even though that atmosphere now comes canned.</p>
        <p>Times Square is the world's leading exemplar of these manufactured centers. And Wilkes's pictures show us the hardware that operates this colossus of urban animatronics -- the hidden spaces that house the social condenser's electric circuitry. Command posts where human operators serve electronic brains. The lifts that transport the electricians who keep the spectacle glowing. As expressions of contemporaneity, this covert architecture far outshines the new skyscrapers in Times Square. It is the real world urban matrix, where human energy still has its uses amid electrified grids.</p>
        <p>Debord took a dim view of what we call urbanism: street furniture, signage, zones for art and entertainment. Planners envision such projects as the fullest expression of the civic spirit, a reinforcement of the city's historic role in modern democracy.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Debord regarded urbanism as an instrument of control. Where planners see public space, Debord saw isolation, the fragmentation of citizens into shopping units, their identities derived from a limited selection of brands. In Times Square, the crowd is an urban product to be consumed along with the signs. The crowd is itself a sign, the icon of a public that has passed into history along with the muggers, drug addicts and prostitutes that once gave Times Square its bleary edge.</p>
        <p>Brainwashed American and image shopper that I am, I am a big fan of the new Times Square. I think it is true to its name, perhaps the most chronologically attuned chunk of real estate in the world. The invasion of media giants -- Disney, Conde Nast, Bertelsmann, Virgin -- has heightened the synchronization of time and place. Never before have the producers and consumers of media been brought into closer proximity. They rub shoulders in the street, linked by a zest for the ephemeral that I fully share.</p>
        <p>Debord, whose ''Society of the Spectacle'' was published in 1967, was prophetic. Decades before the New Economy, long before the digitalization of absolutely everything, he foresaw the oligarchic uses to which these technologies might be put. In this sense, Times Square is completely monstrous, the gigantic maw of the New Economic beast. With the cylindrical Nasdaq sign, the beast even has a pretty nose.</p>
        <p>But the evolution of Times Square continues. Recently, rumblings have been heard to the effect that the new Times Square is becoming too much like the old Times Square. While crime has not returned, there's too much loitering. People from the wrong neighborhoods are getting off the subways. These complaints are music to my ears. They mean that Times Square is still contested space and that people actually have a place in this ''people'' place. The circuits run in more than one direction. The vital signs give cause for hope.</p>
