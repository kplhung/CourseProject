        <p>In a town eating and breathing Subway Series, what could be a more appropriate fashion statement than the licensed T-shirt of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority? In Grand Central Terminal, where the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium meets the No. 4 to Yankee Stadium, more than 300 shirts bearing the authority's logos for the lines were sold in nine hours on Thursday at the New York Transit Museum store. Earlier this year, No. 7 shirts were hot properties, following the ill remarks about the line in Sports Illustrated by John Rocker of the Atlanta Braves. New Yorkers snapped up a diversity-celebrating version of the No. 7 shirt with ''International Express'' on the back in 17 languages.</p>
        <p>This week, sales of shirts emblazoned with the two stadiums' subway stops (Willets Point-Shea Stadium and 161 Street-Yankee Stadium) are in a dead heat, said Dennis Anchard, acting manager of the Grand Central store. The shirts are also available at the museum's stores in Times Square and Brooklyn Heights, and online at www.citystuff.com. The shirts come in two styles: short-sleeve shirts, in gray, are $19; raglan sleeves, left, in white-black or gray-black, are $22.</p>

        <p>''The Mets are the real lunch-pail, fan-friendly New York team,'' said Jack Lepetich, 46, selecting a No. 7 shirt. Susan Moesker, 27, bought the rival Bronx version. ''Why,'' she asked, ''would anyone ever want to go to Shea Stadium?''</p>
