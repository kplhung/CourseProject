        <p>Roll over, roll over, roll over. Retirement planners can repeat that financial advice to mobile young workers until they are blue in the face, but the message does not always get across, especially when cold hard cash is involved.</p>
        <p>Consider a 30-year-old worker who recently changed jobs and has $20,000 in her 401(k) account -- and visions of a shiny new car in her head. She has two choices, according to Segal Advisors, the investment consulting arm of the Segal Company in New York.</p>
        <p>She can take an early distribution of that account and watch as 30 percent of it  disappears in an instant -- 20 percent is withheld for income taxes and 10 percent is snatched away as an early withdrawal penalty. She now has $14,000 left and may have to settle for a subcompact instead of an S.U.V.</p>
        <p>But if she heeds the advice of retirement planners and rolls over her 401(k) into another qualified plan or individual retirement account, she will amass close to $300,000 by age 65, assuming an 8 percent rate of return, according to Segal. As for getting the car, she can get a loan.</p>
        <p>''There are so many reasons why you would want to take the money out,'' said Robert A. Libreto, vice president at Segal Advisors. But once you move it out, he added, ''you start using it for things it wasn't meant for.''</p>
