        <p>The Guise of the Grotesque</p>
        <p>A mysterious ancient creature that can transform itself into grotesque and exotic guises is the principal character in ''The Skriker,'' a work by the British playwright Caryl Churchill, now running at the Yale School of Drama's new theater, Holcombe T. Green Jr. Hall.</p>
        <p>The ''thing'' doggedly pursues two teenage girls through London and a strange underworld, intent on injecting itself into their lives and sending them over the edge of sanity.</p>
        <p>''The Skriker'' had its premiere performances at the Royal National Theater in London in 1994 and was produced at the Public Theater in New York two years later, winning comments like ''astonishing,'' ''spine-chilling'' and ''epic'' from critics here and abroad.</p>
        <p>Performance times are Monday at 7 p.m. and Tuesday through Saturday at 8 p.m.; the theater is at 1156 Chapel Street in New Haven. Tickets: $10 to $15. Information and reservations: (203) 432-1234.</p>
        <p>Pictures From the Plains</p>
        <p>The paintings in Jean Jack's exhibition, called ''Forms in Solitude: Houses of the Plains,'' combine the lonely stillness of Edward Hopper with the ambiguous pastels of David Hockney. The show may be seen at the Flinn Gallery of the Greenwich Library through Nov. 3.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jack, a New Englander by birth and a former student at the Arts Students League in New York, moved to New Mexico 10 years ago. She has been painting pictures of buildings in landscapes for 40 years, and has the unadorned essence of her subjects down to a T.</p>
        <p>Viewing hours at the library, at 101 West Putnam Avenue (Post Road), are Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday from 10 to 8, and Sunday from 1 to 5. Information: (203) 622-7900.</p>
        <p>Take a Card, Any Card</p>
        <p>A Festival of Cards is scheduled at the Stamford Museum &amp; Nature Center today at 2 p.m. with a program called ''Playing Card Magic Through the Centuries,'' suitable for adults and children 5 and older.</p>
        <p>The magician is Robert Olson, who performs a repertoire of card tricks replete with period costumes, props and early 1800's commentary.</p>
        <p>At 3 p.m. a tour of the exhibition  ''Authors, Old Maid and One-Eyed Jacks'' will be conducted by Stuart Kaplan, owner of what is arguably the most comprehensive collection of playing cards and card games extant. His collection was mined for this exhibition and he will provide a stream of card lore while strolling through the show.</p>
        <p>Tickets for the 2 p.m. program are $8 and include admission to the museum and the tour. Admission to the museum is $5, $4, and $3 depending on age and includes the tour. The museum is in north Stamford at 39 Scofieldtown Road at the junction with High Ridge Road (Route 137). Information: (203) 322-1646.</p>
        <p>Campaign Briefing</p>
        <p>Joe Klein, best known as the ''Anonymous'' author of the novel ''Primary Colors,'' has been a political analyst, political reporter and columnist for Newsweek magazine, Washington correspondent for The New Yorker, Guggenheim Fellow and guest on ''Meet the Press'' and ''Charlie Rose.'' He has also written non-fiction books, book reviews, articles for numerous news publications and more.</p>
        <p>So if there is anything left to say after all these months of talking about the political campaign, he can be counted on to find it and share it.  That's his assignment on Thursday at 7:30 when he conducts a session of Fairfield University's Open Visions Forums, titled ''Town Forum on the Presidential Campaign.''</p>
        <p>The program will be in the Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts on the university's Benson Road campus. Tickets: $15 or $12 for older adults; reservations: (203) 254-4010.</p>
        <p>Cinematic Shakespeare</p>
        <p>''Directors of Shakespeare on Film,'' a series of three lectures accompanied by film clips, will take place today, Oct. 29 and Nov. 5 at 3 p.m. in the Yale Center for British Art, 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven. The speaker will be Murray Biggs, adjunct associate professor of English and theater studies at Yale since 1986 and director of more than 30 productions.</p>
        <p>Today's subject will be Laurence Olivier and his directorial chores on ''Henry V'' (1944), ''Hamlet'' (1947) and ''Richard III'' (1954-55). Orson Welles' ''Macbeth'' (1947), ''Othello'' (1949-52) and ''Chimes at Midnight'' (1964-65) will be discussed next Sunday. The final program will focus on Franco Zeffirelli's productions of ''The Taming of the Shrew'' (1966), ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1967 and ''Hamlet'' (1989). Admission is free. Recorded information: (203) 432-2800.</p>
        <p>Off to Galapagos</p>
        <p>The next best thing to a trip to the Galapagos Islands and a dive down 3,000 feet into a perpetually dark sea is to see the IMAX film ''Galapagos,'' running at the Marine Aquarium in Norwalk through Jan. 11.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Branagh provides the voice-over narration for the movie, about the placewhere, 160 years ago, Charles Darwin explored the islands and islets and found what were then unbelievable creatures.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carole Baldwin, a scientist at the Smithsonian Institution, spent 14 weeks in 1998 and 1999 on the filming expedition. For the deep water segments, she used a two-person submersible.</p>
        <p>Daily screening times are 11 a.m. and 1, 2, and 3 p.m., with extra shows on Saturday and Sunday at noon and 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>The aquarium is at 10 North Water Street and tickets are $6.75 for adults, $5.75 for older adults and $5 for children 2 through 12. Information: (203) 852-0700, ext. 206.</p>
