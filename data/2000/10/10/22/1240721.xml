        <p>WITH collecting vying with gardening as America's leading hobby, the annual antique show at Lockwood-Mathews Mansion has chosen ''Collecting in the 21st Century'' as its theme.</p>
        <p>''In this age of having it all, collecting has emerged as a trend no one can ignore,'' said Meri Stevens Kulina, a member of the executive committee for the show, which runs Friday through Sunday.</p>
        <p>Three dealers will discuss their specialties and their thoughts on collecting in 30-minute sessions between 2 and 4 p.m. on Friday.</p>
        <p>One session will feature Blake and Monica Kemper, owners of Solomon Suchard Antiques in Shaker Heights, Ohio, the leading importers of antique French faience in the United States. They will bring hand-painted pottery of Alfred Beau, the first director of the Museum of Fine Art in Quimper, who is, Mr. Kemper said,  ''considered the town's finest potter of faience in its 300-year history.</p>
        <p>''There are serious collectors in love with the French countryside, who collect only pottery designed by this artist, made in that 22-year period between 1870 and 1892,'' Mr. Kemper said. ''It's a very narrow niche in the collecting spectrum.''</p>
        <p>Another session will be conducted by Anne Piper of Anne M. Piper Appointments in Silver from Keene, N.H., who specializes in antique silver: sterling flatware, plated and sterling holloware and early Sheffield plates. ''Silver, with some research, is relatively easy to document,'' she said. ''Once I illustrate the differences between sterling, Sheffield plate and American and English silver, visitors may gain insight into what they have.''</p>
        <p>The third workshop will feature Tad Runge of A. E. Runge, Jr. Oriental Rugs of Yarmouth, Me., whose roots in the Oriental rug business date to the 1880's when his great-grandfather, Edward Runge, bought and sold Oriental rugs in New York City to the Morgans and the Altmans. He will compare the decorative value of older Oriental rugs to newer handmade and machine-made Oriental ''design'' rugs.</p>
        <p>The show, the primary fund raiser for the museum's restoration projects and educational programs, will feature 28 dealers on the main floor of the 62-room national historic landmark mansion. There will also be a special exhibition on antique local and regional maps.</p>
        <p>A preview party begins on Thursday; tickets are $100 and reservations are required. On Friday at 9 a.m., in what has become an annual sneak preview, a ''collectors tour'' of the show will again be led by Albert Hadley, a leader among interior designers. The $25 fee includes show admission, conversation, coffee and book signing with the decorator. And on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. the William Doyle Galleries of New York City will conduct an Heirloom Appraisal Day in the Collector's Tent ($15 includes show admission and verbal auction estimates for up to three items).</p>
        <p>Daily admission $10. Show hours Friday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum, 295 West Avenue, Norwalk. Information: (203) 838-9799, or www.lockwoodmathews.org.</p>
