        <p>1. Although Lee Radziwill has been photographed many times, and by many masters, including Horst, Irving Penn and Richard Avedon, one of her favorite photographs of herself is a newspaper photo taken by The New York Times in December 1969 (a). Cecil Beaton escorted her to the opening of ''Coco'' on Broadway, and Radziwill wore a silk velvet dress by Yves Saint Laurent, her favorite designer at the time. Saint Laurent also did six of the costumes she wore when she appeared in a Chicago stage production of ''The Philadelphia Story'' in 1967 (b).</p>
        <p>2. Back in the 60's, Radziwill's homes and clothing provided some of the most salient style images of the decade, as these photographs of her -- (a) Mongiardino tented living room in London; (b) arrival in Acapulco in 1966; and (c) appearance at Truman Capote's Black and White Ball -- illustrate.</p>

        <p>1. Although Lee Radziwill has been photographed many times, and by many masters, including Horst, Irving Penn and Richard Avedon, one of her favorite photographs of herself is a newspaper photo taken by The New York Times in December 1969 (a). Cecil Beaton escorted her to the opening of ''Coco'' on Broadway, and Radziwill wore a silk velvet dress by Yves Saint Laurent, her favorite designer at the time. Saint Laurent also did six of the costumes she wore when she appeared in a Chicago stage production of ''The Philadelphia Story'' in 1967 (b).</p>
        <p>2. Back in the 60's, Radziwill's homes and clothing provided some of the most salient style images of the decade, as these photographs of her -- (a) Mongiardino tented living room in London; (b) arrival in Acapulco in 1966; and (c) appearance at Truman Capote's Black and White Ball -- illustrate.</p>
        <p>3. Her fashion sensibility for the past 10 years or so has been ''just about as simple as a human being's can be.'' She prefers black -- I just feel abnormal in color or anything trendy'' -- and wears mostly pants and shirts by Giorgio Armani. Radziwill worked as a special-projects consultant, and muse, to Armani for about 10 years beginning in 1985. She does own a long Yohji Yamamoto evening dress, and on a cold day during our visit in Paris, Radziwill wore a short black leather jacket with fur trim designed by Narcisco Rodriguez, who, like Yohji Yamamoto, was a friend and favorite of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's. Although wearing lots of jewelry, if any jewelry at all, is not Radziwill's thing, she does admire the work being done by her friend Victoire de Castellane, who designs the couture jewelry for Christian Dior (21 East 57th Street).</p>
        <p>4. In Paris, removed from the fast pace of New York, Radziwill has more time for what she calls ''an interior life.'' Namely, she is an avid reader. Most recently, she felt called upon to reread the works of J.D. Salinger, inspired by having read ''Dream Catcher,'' the recently published memoir by the author's daughter, Margaret Salinger.</p>
        <p>5. Christian Liaigre, who has designed Calvin Klein's apartment and Marc Jacobs's offices in SoHo, taught drawing in Paris in the 1960's until he gave up city life for country life and breeding horses. Inspired by things like the sea, the sand, even saddle makers' leather, he created his first furniture collection in 1987. Liaigre's designs are licensed to Holly Hunt -- (312) 329-5999 -- in the U.S. His fall 2000 collection includes some colorful pieces, like this chair.</p>
        <p>6. Karl Lagerfeld wasn't the first fashion designer to purge himself of his elaborate trappings in the name of modernity. The honor goes to Jacques Doucet (his dress illustrated here), who in 1909 bought Picasso's painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' Doucet's acquisition of the avant-garde painting caused a sensation among the beau monde of the day. In 1912, Doucet flustered polite society even more when he auctioned his entire collection of 18th-century art and furniture and became a trailblazer of 19th- and 20th-century art and decoration. With proceeds from the auction, approximately $3 million, Doucet commenced to collect more paintings by Picasso as well as artwork by van Gogh, Cezanne and Degas. He also commissioned furniture from Pierre Legrain and Eileen Gray, the Christian Liaigres of their day.</p>
