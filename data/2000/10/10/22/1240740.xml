        <p>TWO presidents, Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela, and two prime ministers, Tony Blair and Ehud Barak, have turned to the pollster Stanley B. Greenberg for advice.</p>
        <p>His polls are not for public consumption. The information gleaned from his polling efforts is shared with his clients, international and national, political and corporate. Dr. Greenberg's interest lies in managing social change and reform.</p>
        <p>Recently Dr. Greenberg worked with his client Vice President Al Gore in what he called ''debate camp'' in Tennessee to prepare for each debate. He says the purpose of  the polls is ''to understand what's going on in the campaign and develop a strategy.''</p>
        <p>He has on occasion conducted polls together with Fred Steeper, Governor Bush's pollster on international affairs and foreign trade issues. They work together to reassure their clients that the polls will be nonpartisan.</p>
        <p>He is interested in the process. ''Who's ahead is the least interesting part of a poll. The poll is about understanding the dynamics of the election and then figuring out how to move the voters to a different place than they are now.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Greenberg believes that the traditional method of polling by telephone is on the way out. Often his staff must make 20 calls to reach one human.</p>
        <p>With the advent of fax machines and answering machines, voice mail and screening and the strong aversion people have to being called by strangers, he says, ''Vote polling is in trouble.'' And he explained that his set of questions lasts 25 minutes. He predicts that Internet polling will become commonplace within two to four years.</p>
        <p>He polls out of political conviction and carefully selects for whom he will work. ''I work for people I believe in. It's part of the kind of political progress I want to see made.'' Recently Dr. Greenberg met at his home that he shares with his wife, United States Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, in New Haven to discuss his work. Following are excepts from that conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Do poll results influence voters' decisions?</p>
        <p>A. I don't believe that and I also don't think that shows enough respect for voters. I think voters take the election very seriously. They know this is an important election. Who gets elected president effects their lives. There is no evidence that they follow the crowd or pundits. If the public followed pundits then Bill Clinton would have been out of office a long time ago.</p>
        <p>Throughout the entire time of Monica Lewinsky, the entire impeachment process, time after time, the pundits said ''this is the big moment, he's gone,'' ''now he's truly jeopardized his position.'' They were always wrong. All they had to do was go to a focus group and listen to people who were very thoughtful about it. They had very well developed views of how to judge a president and were balancing some very important things in a very serious way. But they weren't listening to the pundits about how what judgment they should make about the president. They were not going to allow the elite to take away their election. They elected Bill Clinton president. They didn't elect the Republican congress.</p>
        <p>Q. Are polls ever inaccurate?</p>
        <p>A. Sure they are, though not usually. Usually it's a problem of interpretation rather than the polls being wrong. One problem that you have  with polls is the press focuses on the most extreme poll. On any given day  you take six, seven polls that are out there. If you take the average that's  probably close to where the race is. That's because of sampling theory. There is going to be a distribution around a real value in the middle. But the press wants to write about the most interesting one, the one that is the most different is the one they write about. That's the one that is most likely to be wrong. Not that it was badly done. Polls will have a distribution of samples that will vary. That will always happen. Go to the average, go to the most boring poll, the one that's in the middle of the pack, and probably it's the one that is the closest. So the press will overinterpret the polls, the one that is most extreme.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you assess the undecided voting bloc in your polls?</p>
        <p>A. Figuring out what is going to happen to the undecided vote is the most difficult, most complex part, of figuring out an election. Usually when you have an incumbent who is very well known, such as Bill Clinton was in 1996, he doesn't get any of the undecided vote. There's a reason why they are holding back. They are not saying what that is. Bill Clinton polled 49 percent. And he got 49 percent. All the undecideds went someplace else.</p>
        <p>The difficulty with this election is Al Gore is not quite an incumbent. And you have an election where many more people think the country is moving in the right direction. This is not a ''throw the bums out election.'' People would like to preserve a lot of what's going right and so it's complex to gauge the undecideds.  The problem is not the accuracy of polls. The problem is interpreting them.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you conduct a poll?</p>
        <p>A. I don't believe in doing just polls. I always do focus groups. In a  presidential campaign you poll quite regularly. We'll do two or three national polls a week. In addition to that every night we'll have focus groups. We bring a couple of groups of 10 people together in a room. Usually  they are people who are like-minded and undecided, people who say they are Bush voters and who say they are open to Gore. People who are the  kind of voters we need to reach. Also demographically similar so that they  are comfortable. We don't mix post graduates with high school graduates because the post graduates will dominate and there will be a kind of  deference to them on issues that they don't deserve. We have demographic  homogeneity so people are comfortable. I always separate women from men so women can bond to each other faster. These sessions last two hours maximum.</p>
        <p>Q. When you do these groups abroad do you find any differences?</p>
        <p>A. In France, when I do these they last about five hours. We serve wine and dinner. It's a very relaxed, full evening. It's an intense intellectual  experience. It doesn't matter whether it's a working class group or college educated group. It's a very different environment. The goal is the same, to make people comfortable.</p>
        <p>Usually here it's done in a mall because people are comfortable going to a mall, a public place where people get together. In Britain, we do it in people's houses. Americans would not be so comfortable going into people's houses.</p>
        <p>Q. What factors do voters consider as they choose between Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush?</p>
        <p>A. They are trying to make an assessment. Is he real? Is he genuine? Does he have a record that says can he can really do this, make a difference? They think, ''I don't want to be disappointed. I don't want to believe this is just a bunch of promises. I want to know whether this can be done. That we can afford it. That it will effect my life and the country.''</p>
        <p>These are underlying fundamentals that have to do with the issues and have to do with the economy.</p>
