        <p>PERIODICALLY, and especially when he reaches a landmark like a retrospective exhibition, an artist will reflect on how he got where he is. Some artists are able to recognize their earliest influences and inspiration even if they were experienced before picking up a brush or camera.</p>
        <p>At the Neuberger Museum of Art here, Jed Devine, who is on the faculty of Purchase College, is showing 62 of his black and white photographs taken between 1966 and the present.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is notable for the wide range of subjects: portraits of Mr. Devine's children, photographs of drawings he made when he studied painting, trees in Maine, still lifes in which the objects tumble around as in a Cezanne painting and an arrangement of toy horses on the dining room table, to name a few.</p>
        <p>What these disparate items have in common is what Judy Collischan, the Neuberger's chief curator, describes as the concept of reflection, a ''cohesiveness and a pervasive sense of atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Devine acknowledges his teacher at Pleasantville High School and Junior High School as the earliest source of his interest in the visual arts. He invited the teacher, Walter Hahn, to the museum to join in an interview.</p>
        <p>It is easy to understand the impression that Mr. Hahn made on Mr. Devine in the 50's and 60's. He was a painter who was exhibiting in New York City galleries. He had won a major international art prize, the Prix de Rome. He was also a potter, who gained a reputation as a master maker of tea scoops.</p>
        <p>''My aim as a teacher was to get the students to understand that art on a high level is essential to life,'' Mr. Hahn said. ''In 1953 the faculty inaugurated a program combining English, the visual arts and music that presented a coordinated picture of the culture of a particular time. But in 1957 the Russians launched Sputnik -- and there was an immediate heavy emphasis on science and math. Jed was a straight-A student, and he wanted to pursue the arts. I felt guilty encouraging him to go against the major direction of American society, but I told him to find his own way in life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Devine attended Yale and graduated cum laude in fine arts. ''I made extremely minimal paintings, but then I suddenly stopped,'' he said. ''This kind of work, the kind of big paintings so prevalent in the 1960's and 1970's had so little to do with the world. The disconnect was really too great. I got a job teaching at a prep school outside of Hartford, but I quit after a year.''</p>
        <p>That the world contained wider possibilities for art than his works showed would suggest that Mr. Devine was impressed in an unexpected way. ''I had what might be called a mini-conversion while riding on a train,'' he said. ''I realized that sunlight doesn't care what it's on -- even debris on the tracks. I went back to Yale and studied photography.</p>
        <p>''I began teaching at Purchase in 1977. In the beginning levels, I put the emphasis on looking. At first they don't think that they can look and find material for photographs. But I stress that anything is fair game for a photograph.''</p>
        <p>He does not spend a lot of time lecturing students about major photographs of the past. Instead, he brings in books for them to peruse.</p>
        <p>''It's language that's really important,'' Mr. Devine continued. ''So I have my students bring in a poem that illustrates a link with their photography. I want to extend their ability to talk about things that they already know.''</p>
        <p>The works in Mr. Devine's exhibition are arranged in small groups that have a certain logic to them. Sometimes the connections are obvious; sometimes not.</p>
        <p>All of the photographs are untitled, but Mr. Devine said that the young man and a young woman in meditative poses in the opening sequence were his son and daughter.</p>
        <p>''My son is a year out of college,'' he said. ''He's quite an idealist, but he has the luxury of not having to make a career choice.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition ''Jed Devine Photographs'' is on view through Dec. 31 at the Neuberger Museum of Art, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase. Information: (914) 251-6100.</p>
