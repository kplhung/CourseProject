        <p>'The next president is going to appoint three, maybe even four, justices of the Supreme Court,'' Al Gore declared in a moment of enthusiasm during the first presidential debate. But Gore and George W. Bush said little about their visions of the court, except to dance around the one question that has obsessed presidential candidates since 1980.

He promised to appoint judges ''who will strictly interpret the Constitution,'' as opposed to ''liberal, activist judges who will use their bench to subvert the legislature.''</p>
        <p>In fact, both candidates are repeating slogans from old debates that may not turn out to be central during the next four years. Consider abortion. There are now six justices on the court who support the core principle of Roe v. Wade -- namely, that abortions can't be banned before fetal viability. Only three justices believe, as Justice Antonin Scalia declared as recently as June, that Roe ''must be overruled.'' For Roe to be overturned, Bush would have to replace two pro-Roe justices -- say, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor -- with two committed anti-Roe justices. Given the uncertainties of Supreme Court retirements, he might not have this opportunity. What's more, overturning Roe wouldn't lead to a national ban on abortion. Although some state legislatures would vote to restrict abortion, many would maintain the status quo.</p>
        <p>Even if we assume conservatively that the next president will have only one court appointment, however, the stakes in November's election are high. There are a number of issues on which the court is more closely divided along ideological lines than it is over abortion. One is affirmative action, where the vote of a single new justice could decide whether or not race-conscious admissions in public schools and universities are permitted in America. Another key issue concerns the balance of power between the federal government and the states.</p>
        <p>The word ''federalism'' tends to make most people's eyes glaze over. But although the issue gets less attention than affirmative action and abortion, it is no less important. During the past five years, the Supreme Court has struck down all or part of 25 federal laws, from the line-item veto to the Brady gun-control law. In many of these cases, the court decided -- by slim 5-to-4 margins -- that Congress or the president had encroached on states' rights or on the separation of powers. The election of 2000, therefore, could redefine the shape of the federal government. If Gore wins, the court might well abandon its recent attempts to impose meaningful limits on Congress's power. If Bush wins, however, the court could embark on a concerted attempt to roll back the boundaries of the modern regulatory state.</p>
        <p>How would the country be changed by such an effort? Some of the laws that the court has struck down so far -- like the decorously named Violence Against Women Act -- might be viewed as symbolic laws, designed to please powerful constituency groups rather than to solve national problems. (It is arguable, for example, that violence against women is already regulated adequately by the states.) But the court in recent years has begun to impose more serious limits on federal authority -- preventing Congress from authorizing senior citizens to sue the State of Florida for age discrimination, for example, and preventing the Food and Drug Administration from regulating tobacco as a drug. If the court continues much further down this path, the effects on national politics could be profound. The federal government might have much less discretion to regulate water and air quality and to control the spread of viruses that haven't yet crossed state lines. Indeed, Congress might be hamstrung in its efforts to enforce national solutions to a host of problems that can be only dimly imagined today -- involving crime, privacy and the regulation of cloning and other genetic technology. Even if you applaud the idea of serious limitations on federal power, you might be wary about having them imposed by the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Many people are familiar by now with the constitutional arguments for and against legalized abortion and affirmative action. But the debate over federalism tends to be too abstract to get even the hearts of lawyers pounding. In the hope of making the issue more concrete, I visited two judges who have written influential opinions on opposite sides of the debate: J. Michael Luttig, an appellate judge in Virginia; and David S. Tatel, an appellate judge in Washington. This choice of judges was not made casually. Luttig is considered a leading candidate for a Supreme Court appointment in a Bush administration; Tatel is among those who are similarly well regarded by the Gore camp. Conversations with each of them, therefore, offer insights into the very different directions the Supreme Court could take in a Bush or Gore administration.</p>
        <p>'Michael Luttig is a conservative's conservative,'' says Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice in Washington. ''He's not afraid to be a risk-taker and to look behind the meaning of statutes and use the judicial power to rein in the federal government.'' Luttig is an idol of the conservative legal movement today, which can be summed up with the following battle cry: No more Souters! Having appointed five out of the past seven justices with the express purpose of over-turning the landmark decisions of the Warren and Burger Courts -- Roe v. Wade, Miranda and the school-prayer decisions -- conservatives are understandably frustrated that this aspect of the counterrevolution failed. Their frustration is focused, in particular, on Justice David Souter, whom they view as having committed a dastardly betrayal by morphing into a vision of his predecessor, the liberal hero William Brennan. Among conservatives, Luttig is widely viewed as the anti-Souter, the absolutely reliable nominee.</p>
        <p>Having read Luttig's opinions, which display a relish for eviscerating the logical flaws of his colleagues, I was surprised and charmed by his self-deprecating friendliness and emotional accessibility. He is an extremely likable man. Unlike Justice Scalia, for whom he clerked, Luttig is intelligent without being a showoff. Born and reared in Texas, he has a down-home unpretentiousness that might very well appeal to George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Luttig, 46, showed me around his chambers on the ninth floor of the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va., which are adorned with autographed pictures of Supreme Court justices featuring unusually intimate inscriptions. As a Department of Justice official in the Bush administration, Luttig worked tirelessly for the confirmation of David Souter in 1990 and Clarence Thomas in 1991. Thomas's gratitude is evident in several pictures, one of which shows him in shirt sleeves with his arm around Luttig's shoulder. Another picture has an inscription from ''Clarence,'' which reads: ''This would not have been possible without you! Thanks so much, buddy!''</p>
        <p>Luttig's speedy progress from law clerk for Chief Justice Warren E. Burger to White House aide to federal appellate judge -- he was appointed by President Bush at the improbable age of 36 -- has given his opinions a confident, relentlessly logical quality, like those of a bright, young law professor who has never been chastened by life outside the academy. Luttig, who studied Ludwig Wittgenstein in college, is known for making mathematically precise arguments, especially in cases involving the limits of federal power.</p>
        <p>Six years ago, however, Luttig suffered a personal tragedy, which he agreed only reluctantly to discuss. In 1994, Luttig's father was brutally murdered in his garage in Tyler, Tex., by three young carjackers who shot him twice in the head as he got out of his car. After watching her husband's murder, Luttig's mother survived by playing dead.</p>
        <p>''I loved him more than life,'' Luttig told me as we sat in his office. ''Everything he said and did, I respected. He is the single-most important influence in my life. He is my hero.'' The experience of sitting through the federal and state trials of his father's murderers, Luttig suggests, helped him to sympathize with a defendant's family. ''When my mother walked in the courtroom, she walked past the mother of one of the people who killed my dad,'' he said. ''There was a look on her face: 'God, how did this happen?' My mother hugged the woman, and I followed -- I hugged the woman. It forced you to think about things at the outer margins of life. There was a bond established between my family and her family.''</p>
        <p>One of the carjackers was convicted and sentenced to death. The death sentence is now being reviewed by the United States Court of Appeals, and Gov. George Bush may ultimately be responsible for deciding whether the execution should proceed.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Luttig was asked to recuse himself from a death-penalty appeal by the defendant's lawyers, who argued that Luttig couldn't be impartial in light of his father's death. But Luttig rejected the request, arguing persuasively that judges shouldn't recuse themselves from capital cases merely because they had ''experienced the fullness of life -- good and bad.'' In 1938, when Earl Warren was a district attorney, his own father was murdered by a burglar. Warren went on to become chief justice and rule on many capital cases. Nevertheless, Luttig's ordeal could hardly have made him more conservative in death-penalty cases: even before the tragedy, he was already the most conservative judge on the most conservative appellate court in the nation. In his nine years on the bench, Luttig has never voted to reverse a death-penalty conviction.</p>
        <p>Luttig was also asked to recuse himself in a recent case involving restrictions on abortion. In 1998, Virginia became one of many states that passed laws forbidding so-called partial-birth abortions. Luttig wrote an opinion allowing the law to go into effect. In June, however, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, disagreed with Luttig's analysis. When it came time for Luttig to re-evaluate Virginia's law in the wake of the Supreme Court decision, he rejected a request by abortion rights lawyers that he step aside. Luttig held his nose and applied the Supreme Court decision with which he disagreed.</p>
        <p>''As a court of law,'' he wrote, ''ours is neither to devise ways in which to circumvent the opinions of the Supreme Court nor to indulge delay in the full implementation of the court's opinions.'' Luttig told me that it was important that different justices, appointed by different presidents, had decided to reaffirm Roe after it had been the subject of vigorous debate. ''If you don't believe in the disruption of society, reliance on precedent is important,'' he said cautiously. ''At the other end of the spectrum is the magnitude of the analytical errors. In each case there's a heavy choice -- not heavy as in brooding, but heavy -- with the need for incremental movement, so the court doesn't lose respect.'' This pronouncement -- that judges should generally respect precedents, except those that are flamboyantly wrong -- will hardly reassure partisans of Roe v. Wade.</p>
        <p>Luttig's confirmation hearings might focus on his views about abortion, but his most important legacy as a lower court judge has been his enthusiasm in applying the Supreme Court's recent decisions restricting federal power. It was Luttig who wrote the lower court decision striking down the Violence Against Women Act, which the Supreme Court reaffirmed by a vote of 5 to 4. The Constitution authorizes Congress to ''regulate commerce . . . among the several States,'' and between 1941 and 1995 the Supreme Court didn't strike down a single federal law on the grounds that it exceeded this broad power. But recent Supreme Court decisions have construed Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce more narrowly. Although Congress concluded (rather tendentiously) that violence against women affects interstate commerce by impairing their productivity, Luttig reasoned that any economic effects of violence against women were too remote to be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>In a concurring opinion, Luttig's colleague J. Harvie Wilkinson 3rd reflected on the dangers of what he candidly called ''judicial activism'' by conservatives. Wilkinson, a well-respected moderate conservative, is himself mentioned as a leading Supreme Court candidate in a Bush administration. A former law professor and newspaper editor in Virginia, Wilkinson argued that any time courts refuse to defer to the decisions of legislative bodies, their decisions must be called activist. But he insisted that the Supreme Court's recent decisions limiting the scope of federal power were more defensible than than those of previous eras of judicial activism, the 1930's and 1960's, because the court was merely acting as a ''structural referee'' between federal and state governments. Looking to the future, however, Wilkinson cautioned that ''if modern activism accelerates to a gallop'' -- leading to a ''wholesale invalidation of environmental, civil rights and business regulation'' -- then the new conservative judicial activists would be just as discredited as their predecessors.</p>
        <p>When I asked Luttig what he thought of Wilkinson's warning, he said he disagreed with his colleague's definition of judicial activism. ''It's not true that every time you strike down a law, that's an act of judicial activism,'' Luttig said. ''In fact, it can take any form, including striking something down, but also not striking something down when you are exercising your own policy objectives.''</p>
        <p>The debate between Luttig and Wilkinson continued in a case decided in June. Wilkinson, writing for the majority, upheld an application of the Endangered Species Act to prevent landowners from killing or trapping red wolves on private property. In a vigorous dissent, Luttig insisted that this application of the Endangered Species Act was unconstitutional because ''the killing of even all 41 of the estimated red wolves that live on private property in North Carolina'' would have only a trivial effect on interstate commerce. ''The interpretation of this clause of the Constitution, no less so than any other, must ultimately rest not with the political branches, but with the judiciary,'' Luttig wrote. Wilkinson declared that Luttig's aggressively limited view of national power would ''place in peril the entire federal regulatory scheme for wildlife and natural resource conservation.'' But Luttig sees his view as unflinchingly logical. ''I don't think there's a scholar out there who believes that the commerce power is without check,'' he told me confidently.</p>
        <p>If Bush judges are likely to question the scope of federal power, Gore judges are not. Although Gore has indicated that he would appoint liberal justices like Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan, it is not yet clear if Gore is more willing than President Clinton to expend significant political capital to appoint judicial liberals rather than judicial moderates. At the very least, however, it seems probable that Gore justices, like the moderate Clinton appointees Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, would share a distaste for sweeping exercises of judicial power and a reluctance to strike down federal laws in the name of states' rights. One judicial moderate who fits this mold is David Tatel, appointed by Clinton to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, I visited Judge Tatel in his chambers in Washington. ''Nice to see you,'' Tatel said as he greeted me at the door. ''Come on in, have a seat.'' Ushering me toward a chair, he sat down on a comfortable sofa, behind a coffee table with nothing on it except a copy of Gerald Gunther's biography of Judge Learned Hand.</p>
        <p>I asked what he thought of the book. ''Isn't it great?'' he said. ''There's actually a quote here that I wrote down for my clerks.'' Tatel picked up a small keyboard with six large black keys. He placed an earpiece into his left ear and tapped a few times on the keyboard. ''Here it is, from Page 289: Hand was 'uncertain about the proper result in most cases, even after decades of judicial experience.'''</p>
        <p>It is easy when talking to Tatel to forget that he is blind. A degenerative eye disease, retinitis pigmentosa, began to destroy his sight when he was in his teens, and he became legally blind in the 1970's. But he maintains ordinary eye contact when he speaks and walks freely around his chambers; the keyboard is the only evident sign of his disability.</p>
        <p>''My kids call this my Fisher-Price toy,'' he said. ''I can use it to take an opinion home on disk and work on it myself. It's a great little machine, and it gives me an enormous amount of independence. But it has a terrible voice.'' Reaching over to a telephone on a stand at his right, Tatel punched in a number for a newspaper-reading service for the blind that has a voice he prefers. The voice began to recite the letters to the editor from that day's New York Times so quickly that the words were like high-pitched gibberish. ''That's the speed I like to listen to,'' Tatel said. ''It sort of sounds like your Swedish aunt.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Tatel got up from the couch, walked across the room, sat down in the swivel chair behind his desk, reached under his computer stand, picked up a small device and walked back across the room, reaching only once to touch the bookcase against the wall. ''This holds 5,000 pages of text,'' he said, settling back again on the couch. ''I'm using it to read a whole bunch of Supreme Court cases from last term.'' In the next year or so, Tatel's court will be one of the first to receive briefs and submissions on computer disks, and Tatel will be able to listen to the digital submissions on his portable keyboard. For now, however, Tatel's briefs are read to him by a reader provided by the court. ''I suspect the other judges preparing for this case will prepare for it in two or three hours,'' he said. ''This will take me five or six hours to do it, just because I have to have everything read to me.''</p>
        <p>Tatel, who is trim at 58, swims three mornings a week at the Y, where a clerk meets him to walk to chambers. Until last December, for 30 years he jogged regularly with a friend, navigating the familiar course by tying their arms together with a cord. ''I quit not because of my eyes but because of my back,'' he explained. He is also an enthusiastic skier and has trained his children to ski behind him, calling out the turns on a radio headset. But when I pressed for more details, he asked me to ensure that his blindness wouldn't become the focus of this article. ''Somebody once said that I viewed myself as a judge who happens to be blind rather than a blind judge,'' he said. ''If you get too much into the jogging and the skiing, it becomes an article about my blindness. I don't believe it's like the race issue. I think you can make a very powerful argument that having a black judge is important for the judiciary, or women judges, but it's not like that issue. I hope I wasn't put on this court because of my disability, because I actually don't think it's particularly relevant, whereas I think the race and gender issue can be. Everybody has a lot of experiences in their lives that affect how they look at things. I don't think it's a big deal, and I'm uncomfortable having it be a big deal.''</p>
        <p>Judge Tatel is as deferential to Congressional power as Judge Luttig is willing to rein it in. The differences in their approaches to federal authority is best summed up in a decision that Tatel's court decided last year and is now being reviewed by the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Tatel's conservative colleagues voted to strike down the part of the Clean Air Act that authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate ozone and other forms of air pollution. Resurrecting a judicial doctrine that has not been applied since before the New Deal era, the conservatives held that the Clean Air Act's broad instruction to the E.P.A. to set air-quality standards that will ''protect the public health'' is an unconstitutionally vague delegation of Congress's authority, because no one knows precisely what ''the public health'' is. (To pass muster, the conservatives suggested, the law should have more carefully constrained the E.P.A.'s discretion in choosing one pollution level over another.)</p>
        <p>In a strong dissent, Tatel suggested that the conservatives' reasoning would also call into question the constitutionality of many other broad federal regulations, from the Federal Communications Commission's authority to regulate TV networks to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to determine ''just and reasonable rates'' for electricity. ''Not only did the panel depart from a half-century of Supreme Court separation-of-powers jurisprudence,'' Tatel wrote in a related decision, ''but in doing so, it stripped the Environmental Protection Agency of much of its ability to implement the Clean Air Act, this nation's primary means of protecting the safety of the air breathed by hundreds of millions of people.'' Tatel's position may well be vindicated by the Supreme Court later this year. But during the next decade, battles over the scope of the federal government's power to regulate will probably be fierce.</p>
        <p>Although Tatel has been reluctant to use his authority as a judge to second-guess the political branches, he first made his name as a lawyer by arguing for vigorous judicial intervention in cases involving civil rights. Tatel served as director of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare under President Carter and then as national director of the Lawyers' Committee on Civil Rights Under Law. As a private lawyer, he went on to represent school districts in litigation to promote school desegregation, and he was responsible for negotiating a pioneering desegregation settlement between the N.A.A.C.P. and the City of St. Louis.</p>
        <p>But time appears to have modulated Tatel's view that courts should be the primary engines of social change; he now seems to feel that courts can enforce constitutional rights but should not impose heavy-handed remedies in an effort to remake society. This year, Tatel applied his insights about the limits of judicial activism when a Maryland district judge appointed him to be mediator in a longstanding lawsuit claiming that handicapped children in Baltimore weren't getting the special education to which they were entitled. After ordering the school district to pay millions of dollars and trying to supervise the district himself, the judge, Marvin J. Garbis, finally decided that the parties should set educational goals for the school. With Tatel's help, both sides quickly came to an agreement. Tatel told me that such ''mediated'' discussions were a ''more effective use of judicial power'' than the old mode of forcing change by judicial fiat.</p>
        <p>Tatel's views about judicial power are not minimalistic across the board. He favors a strong role for the courts in protecting individual rights against infringements by Congress as well as by state legislatures and is particularly committed to individual privacy. He dissented from a decision to deny President Clinton the attorney-client privilege during the Monica Lewinsky investigation for conversations with Bruce Lindsey, a White House aide. He struck down part of a recent federal regulation that requires phone companies to turn over to the police information about all the digits that have been dialed after a suspect's call is connected, including voice-mail passwords and bank account information. And he dissented from a decision to uphold the District of Columbia's Juvenile Curfew, which forbids children 16 and under to be in a public place without adult supervision between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Children have a ''fundamental right to free movement,'' Tatel concluded, and parents have a fundamental liberty ''to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.''</p>
        <p>Tatel's reasoning suggests that he would be more inclined than a judge like Luttig to recognize a constitutional right to personal autonomy, which isn't found explicitly in the Constitution. How broadly he would interpret this right is impossible to say. But Tatel seems no more likely to engage in a freewheeling Roe v. Wade-style expansion of the right to privacy than Justices Ginsburg or Breyer, both of whom joined the unanimous Supreme Court in refusing to recognize a broadly defined constitutional right to doctor-assisted suicide. There is, at this moment in our legal culture, little support among judges of either party for the aggressive creation of new constitutional rights. Instead, Democratic and Republican judges are focused on conserving their judicial victories of the last generation and are divided about whether to accept their defeats. While Tatel might not vote to overturn the recent decisions limiting the scope of federal power, he certainly would not vote to extend them. In a recent opinion defending judicial restraint, Tatel noted, ''The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.''</p>
        <p>There is a political subtext to this high-minded debate about federalism. The idea that Congress's power to regulate commerce ''among the several States'' could be interpreted to justify any federal legislation first took hold during the New Deal. Back in 1937, in the face of F.D.R.'s court-packing plan, the conservative justices decided to get out of the business of enforcing constitutional limits on Congress's power. As a result, the modern regulatory state was born. Sixty years later, however, the New Deal is no longer a sacred cow. And it is clear that today's conservative judicial revolution is, in many ways, a response to the New Deal itself. Although ''strict constructionist'' judges like Luttig oppose the use of the courts to create individual rights, these same conservatives are eager to use the courts to resurrect limitations on federal power that have been ignored since the 1930's.</p>
        <p>This election, for better or for worse, will determine whether or not the premise of the New Deal -- that federal power is essentially unlimited -- will remain in force in the 21st century. Although Judge Luttig is correct that the Constitution doesn't seem to anticipate a federal government of unlimited power, Judge Tatel is correct that ever since the New Deal, efforts by judges to enforce those limits have threatened to strike at the heart of what Washington does. And even those who shudder at the excesses of the regulatory state might hesitate before encouraging courts to dismantle it. For more than 50 years, liberals and conservatives agreed that the tyranny of elected representatives was less dangerous than the tyranny of unelected justices of the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>It isn't at all unusual that the candidates and the voters aren't paying attention to the central question the election will resolve. After all, how many of the people who voted for Nixon and Reagan expected their candidates to go to China and end the cold war? As the shortsighted focus on Roe v.
