        <p>WHAT would Cameron Crowe write about Jennifer Lopez if he were a 15-year-old music journalist today? In ''Almost Famous,'' Mr. Crowe presents a giddy, lightly fictionalized account of his own adventures in the mid-1970's on the road for Rolling Stone magazine with bands like Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers. Rock was at its most potent, and Rolling Stone covers were monumental publicity.</p>
        <p>Now, in more cynical times, the stars have managers, press agents and stylists to massage their public images. But then or now, the experience inside the weird world of celebrity journalism is pretty much the same. Writers are sucked into the glamour of someone else's life, spun around for a while and then dumped back into their own mundane reality, which is how ''Almost Famous'' portrays Mr. Crowe's ride, and how I experienced the same roller coaster 25 years later.</p>

        <p>WHAT would Cameron Crowe write about Jennifer Lopez if he were a 15-year-old music journalist today? In ''Almost Famous,'' Mr. Crowe presents a giddy, lightly fictionalized account of his own adventures in the mid-1970's on the road for Rolling Stone magazine with bands like Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers. Rock was at its most potent, and Rolling Stone covers were monumental publicity.</p>
        <p>Now, in more cynical times, the stars have managers, press agents and stylists to massage their public images. But then or now, the experience inside the weird world of celebrity journalism is pretty much the same. Writers are sucked into the glamour of someone else's life, spun around for a while and then dumped back into their own mundane reality, which is how ''Almost Famous'' portrays Mr. Crowe's ride, and how I experienced the same roller coaster 25 years later.</p>
        <p>Last November, Talk magazine assigned me Ms. Lopez, the actress and singer, for its cover. I didn't expect it to be easy; she had already canceled on me for an Elle cover the previous spring, demanding a female writer at the last minute and leaving me unnerved. Scratch a journalist and you'll usually find a writer with loftier goals than celebrity profiling. But you might also find someone with social ambitions. In next month's Vanity Fair, Lisa Robinson, an almost-famous rock writer, publishes her journals from the 1975 Rolling Stones tour, where she put up with ice cubes and eggs in her bed, along with other pranks. Small price to pay, I guess, for being able to say, ''I'm with the band.''</p>
        <p>With Ms. Lopez and company, there weren't any pranks, but it often seemed that the joke was on me. I was first invited to, then disinvited from, a rehearsal for the VH1/Vogue fashion awards in December, and later that day, I was permitted to follow the star only at a distance, spending hours outside her trailer. A few days later, I was invited to ''observe'' her in Las Vegas, backstage at the Billboard music awards, only to be told by two publicists after I'd flown all the way there to forget it.</p>
        <p>Soon after, Ms. Lopez tried to cancel with Talk. With nothing in particular to promote for the spring, her agent saw no point to an article. Tina Brown, the editor in chief, called Tommy Mottola, chairman of Sony Music Entertainment, Ms. Lopez's label, and Howard Stringer, chairman of the Sony Corporation of America. Pressure was applied. Agents were tamed.</p>
        <p>One midnight, I got a call from Talk's celebrity wrangler, an almost-famous person herself. Could I be in Amsterdam the next day? I could, and I arrived at a mall packed with Dutch kids awaiting Ms. Lopez, who was on a music tour of Europe.</p>
        <p>When she walked in two hours late, wearing high-heel boots, a fox-fur coat and pink tinted sunglasses, her manager finally introduced us.</p>
        <p>''Hi,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Suddenly everything changed. Like the kid in ''Almost Famous,'' I was on the bus.</p>
        <p>I soon found myself with Ms. Lopez on a large private jet to Paris, which meant I had about 45 minutes to get her talking. I wasn't bold enough to try to steer her into discussing her relationship with Puffy Combs, which she was known to be adamantly private about, even before the nightclub shooting incident in late December that landed her briefly in police custody. I had my notebook out. She had a copy of Elle, and paged through it while I tried to engage her. Soon the jet was landing and she was whisked away. I spent the next day in two television studios, kept at arm's length while she sat sequestered for hours in dressing rooms.</p>
        <p>Finally, at the end of the day, I was invited to ride with her back to the Ritz. We had 20 minutes, and she spoke quietly in the car about growing up in the Bronx, her family at home and the family she's made for herself on the road.</p>
        <p>In her hotel suite, her intonation rose only when she told her assistants to put some emollients in her bath. Why should she need to be verbal when she's so visual -- if not a great singer, then a truly great dancer (and an appealing actress) who can reach millions on MTV's ''Total Request Live''? Why should she do any work to amuse me at all? Wasn't it my job to make her amusing? I walked away blaming myself.</p>
        <p>The nice thing about being a celebrity, Henry Kissinger once said, is that when you bore people, they think it's their fault. Because Ms. Lopez  ''liked'' me (maybe for not asking inconvenient questions), I was invited out for a night on the town with the company. Being up close to watch her dance at Les Bains-Douches in tight red pants was thrilling, and when she left, she blew me a kiss from her car.</p>
        <p>O.K., she liked me.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, as I was faxing in 6,000 forced words about someone I hardly knew, the Times Square club shooting took place. Although Ms. Lopez was not charged with any crime (Mr. Combs still faces charges of weapons possession and bribery), suddenly, what I'd written was irrelevant, and feverish pleading with her manager and agents to get more time followed.</p>
        <p>In the world of celebrity journalism, every question and request has to pass through all kinds of people whose job it is to prove themselves valuable to the star. There were meetings with Ms. Lopez's manager, conference calls with editors, faxes of questions that might persuade her to speak. She didn't, but I wrote around it.</p>
        <p>Then the last revision was over, and there was nothing more to do. I felt the way Cameron Crowe must have felt when he returned to his suburban bedroom after filing his first cover story from the road: lost in the stars. Instantly, things got quiet. No more proximity to tabloid people, show-business heat and Tina Brown. My life was my own again, but I wasn't sure I liked it as much as I thought I had.</p>
        <p>When the magazine's March issue came out, Ms. Lopez was on the cover, posing as if she were pointing a gun at the world. The most substantive conversation I ever had with her occurred on the phone soon after. She called to tell me she felt violated, because I had written that her contract stipulated 250-thread-count hotel linens. She said I should have asked her about her relationship with Mr. Combs, even though she later said her relationship with him was nobody's business.</p>
        <p>I was too cowed to say anything. Her voice was so fragile and weary and sad. All I could do was apologize.</p>
        <p>Why did I let her off easy, in that conversation and in the puffy article itself? Mr. Crowe, who recently said in an online chat that all writers want to be liked, was lucky to have had a coming-of-age early in life. Really, adolescence is a good time to find out what it means to be fooled by people who are pretending you are cool, in order to control you.</p>
        <p>In middle age, I've learned the same lesson.</p>
        <p>And in addition, Ms. Lopez and I will always have Paris.</p>
