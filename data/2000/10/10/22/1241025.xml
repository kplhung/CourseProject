        <p>The United States Chamber of Commerce is spending more than $1 million for advertising in State Supreme Court races, an official of the organization said on Friday.</p>
        <p>The advertising by the business group is meant to draw voters' attention to candidates who might overrule so-called tort reform legislation favored by business, said Jim Wootton, president of the Institute for Legal Reform at the Chamber.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wootton said the national Chamber had never before conducted such an advertising campaign in state judicial politics.</p>
        <p>The commercials began last week in Mississippi, and Mr. Wootton said the group was considering advertising in as many as seven states. He said the focus was on states where companies say they are plagued by frivolous lawsuits and there is a danger that courts might block tort reform, which limits lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wootton said the advertising was needed because judicial systems in Mississippi and other states were trying to ''waylay'' business interests and were posing ''a serious threat to the national economy.''</p>
        <p>The national Chamber is already contributing to advertising campaigns by its Michigan affiliates dealing with supreme court races and will do so soon in Ohio, Mr. Wootton said. He declined to specify the budget for the advertising but said it was less than $10 million.</p>
        <p>In Mississippi on Thursday, Secretary of State Eric Clark called for an investigation of whether the advertising violated campaign finance laws, but the Chamber says its advertising is educational, not political. The commercials do not specifically say whom to vote for.</p>
        <p>The Chamber's officials have long said that business needs to be more aggressive to counter the influence of trial lawyers over state courts. They argue that judges friendly to plaintiffs' lawyers have declared tort reform laws unconstitutional in many states as a political reward for campaign contributions. That accusation has been strongly denied by judges in many of the states.</p>
        <p>Richard Mason, executive director of the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers, said the national Chamber had no place in state elections.</p>
        <p>''It's really not the business of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,'' Mr. Mason said, ''to make a decision about who the people of Ohio want serving on our Supreme Court.''</p>
