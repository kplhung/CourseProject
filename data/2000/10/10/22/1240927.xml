        <p>NEW YORKERS pride themselves on the quickness and acuity of their eyeball calculus: they find empty taxis in the rain and dodge weirdos weaving their way from afar. But Robert U. Akeret, a psychoanalyst and keen observer, thinks even New Yorkers fall short when it comes to analyzing what the camera captures.</p>
        <p>Dr. Akeret runs his practice out of his rambling Upper West Side apartment. Over the years, his patients have been ordinary people wading through life, with notable exceptions like the man who gained weight and grew his beard to seduce a beloved polar bear. Treating them, one of Dr. Akeret's techniques is ''photoanalysis,'' analyzing family photographs to help people better understand their lives.</p>
        <p>His method has led to many breakthroughs, he says, and to a handsome book full of black-and-white photographs expounding on theories he first wrote about several years ago. The book, published last month, is ''Photolanguage: How Photos Reveal the Fascinating Stories of Our Lives and Relationships'' (W. W. Norton).</p>
        <p>The book has 150 pictures of famous, infamous and ordinary people during the last century. Some are former patients, others include O. J. Simpson and Marilyn Monroe. Dr. Akeret decodes everything from publicity shots to Hillary Rodham Clinton gazing at her husband.</p>
        <p>''I think people are visually illiterate,'' Dr. Akeret said the other day, in an office that opens to a terrace with a panoramic city view. ''They are not reading photographs like a book, from left to right. I show people photographs all the time, and there are things that most people just do not see.''</p>
        <p>In this city, where averting one's eyes on the subway is considered good form and gawking at celebrities bad form, there is an overwhelming amount of visual information to process. Just as Dr. Akeret's patients are unwilling or unable to see the darker truths of their family lives, New Yorkers, too, can read each other in a superficial, selfish way. We can see the muggers, the beggars and the speeding cars, but the city's breakneck pace does not allow too many freeze frames of ordinary emotions. We may put money in the jangling coffee cup, but we do not look into the eyes of the person holding it. We may move over or smirk at the big boys who hog seats on the subway but fail to see the pain or loneliness behind their defensiveness. Then we chalk up our behavior to self-protection or time constraints.</p>
        <p>No wonder we can pull out photographs years later and be shocked by the raw hints of anger or sadness even among those closest to us. Dr. Akeret's book recounts the tale of one patient, a 40-ish woman who was having trouble remembering what her early relationship with her father and brother was. She brought in what appeared to be a fairly innocuous photograph of herself, her brother and her father standing in front of their country home.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Akeret studied the picture, he saw what the patient and a recent visitor to his office could not. The brother's fist was balled up and he was pushing his sister away from their father's embrace. It opened up many memories for her and a better insight into her family.</p>
        <p>''It's reality testing,'' Dr. Akeret said. ''What really went on at that time? The more you know about a photograph, the richer the analysis can be.''</p>
        <p>So he asks a series of questions. What led up to the shot? Who took the picture and why? What do you remember? What were you feeling? What was the relationship among the people in the picture? What do you objectively see when you look at it? How does it make you feel?</p>
        <p>One photograph in the book shows a simple image that led to a breakthrough. The picture shows a girl in a white veil and dress for her First Communion. Her hands are clasped in a gesture of prayer. She is not smiling.</p>
        <p>The patient came to Dr. Akeret as an angry woman who had destroyed the guitar belonging to her musician husband. She said she did not know the source of her anger. When she brought in a stack of photographs, she used the communion picture as an example of her innocence and overall benevolence. ''I said, 'You don't look so happy,' '' Dr. Akeret recalled. '' 'What was going on then?'</p>
        <p>''It turns out her father was taking the photo. There had been a lot of abuse, a lot of putting her down. She said that as he took the picture, she was afraid the father would know what she was thinking.''</p>
        <p>She said she was wishing her father would die. He did, dropping dead of a heart attack in his 40's two days after the photograph was taken. The patient still believed that she had killed her father and that she had the power to kill with her thoughts.</p>
        <p>The work that remained was for the patient to acknowledge her rage, which led to the destroyed guitar, and to realize that she could not will someone dead.</p>
        <p>Whether one examines interior landscapes, city streets or political debates, so much turns on a smirk, a smile or a pointed finger.</p>
