        <p>Mike Piazza was the Mets' designated hitter last night, not the starting catcher, and he was 1 for 5 and left three runners on base.</p>
        <p>But if he needed any words to make him feel better about being the D.H., he received them from, of all people, Yogi Berra, the former Yankee and Hall of Fame catcher.</p>
        <p>Berra visited Bobby Valentine in the visiting manager's office yesterday afternoon and, when not reminiscing about Joe DiMaggio, told Piazza: ''I wish they had the D.H. when I was playing. It would've kept me around another couple of years.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, who was the designated hitter so the right-handed batter Todd Pratt could catch and face the left-handed pitcher Andy Pettitte, should be behind the plate for the rest of the Series. Pratt was 0 for 2 with a walk.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees starting the right-hander Roger Clemens tonight, Valentine said he planned to have Piazza catch Mike Hampton.</p>
        <p>Piazza was the D.H. in interleague games this summer and recalled a game in the Bronx when a Yankees rally forced him to wait an hour between at-bats. ''It felt like I pinch-hit four times,'' he said.</p>
