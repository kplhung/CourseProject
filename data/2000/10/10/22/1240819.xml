        <p>Forty-nine historic sites received approval for funding last week under a state program that to date has provided money primarily to preserve farmland and open spaces.</p>
        <p>The projects, which ranged from churches to a jail, a factory to an airplane hangar, made up the first group of historic sites to be approved under the Garden State Preservation Trust, which will provide $98 million a year for 10 years for the purchase of open space. Of that amount, only $6 million a year is dedicated to preserving historic sites.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Historic Trust, a nonprofit historic preservation organization affiliated with the New Jersey Department of State, announced that it had recommended that the projects get $12 million.</p>
        <p>The agency did not make any allocations last year from the trust fund, which was adopted in June 1999, and therefore doubled the amount for this year's round. Still, it was not enough, said Wes Haynes, a program officer for the New Jersey Historic Trust. ''For every dollar we had to give out, we had $2.65 in requests,'' Mr. Haynes said, noting that there were about 115 applicants.</p>
        <p>Patricia Huizing, executive director of Preservation New Jersey, a private, nonprofit organization, was pleased with the announcement. ''I think it reflects the real diversity of the projects, the wide diversity of the state's historic treasures,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Among the sites are a number of churches, including one of the oldest in the state, St. Peter's Episcopal Church, a Georgian style-structure in Freehold built by the well-known Colonial architect Robert Smith in 1771. One of only five 18th-century church buildings left in New Jersey, it will receive $139,784 for the restoration of its steeple and roof system.</p>
        <p>Another project is the old Bergen County Jail, a fortresslike structure  built in Hackensack around 1912. It was closed to prisoners in 1993 after settlement of a Federal lawsuit claiming it was inhumane. The trust approved a $637,057 matching grant for exterior renovation of the building, which will be used as a repository for court records.</p>
        <p>In Paterson, $750,000 will go to refurbish the frame fitting shop of the old Rogers locomotive works, built in 1881, into a transportation waiting room for those using van pools for work. The project also includes a magnet school focusing on transportation-related jobs and a day care center.</p>
        <p>And a World War II-era Navy airplane hangar at the Cape May County Airport in Rio Grande, is to get a $535,246 matching grant in part for use as an aviation museum.</p>
