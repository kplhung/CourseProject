        <p>THE State University of New York at Farmingdale on Route 110 here has been given both a new grand entrance and a new mission with the recent opening of the first building at its Broad Hollow Bioscience Park.</p>
        <p>The park, planned as an incubator designed eventually to nurture start-up companies in a supportive, relatively inexpensive university-related environment, is a collaborative venture of the college and the nearby Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a leading biological research institution.</p>
        <p>The 50,000-square-foot, $15 million structure, which opened in September, is the first of what is hoped will be a cluster of similar buildings on the campus. The plan is that the other buildings will be devoted to helping fledgling bioscience companies bring science developed at research institutions like Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to commercial application.</p>
        <p>Biotechnology uses living organisms, genetic studies and biological techniques developed through basic research to detect and treat disease. Products have included antibiotics, interferon, and insulin used in the treatment of diabetes.</p>
        <p>The idea of bringing a biotechnology incubator to the Farmingdale campus was initiated by the college in 1997. An 11,000-square-foot pilot incubator for start-up manufacturing companies has been operating on the  campus since 1996, and now houses eight start-ups.</p>
        <p>The school, with 3,000 full-time students and 2,200 part-timers, changed from a two-year to a four-year institution in 1993. It wanted to have a place on campus where students could have hands-on experience using the technology they will be learning in the classroom, said Dr. Michael J. Vinciguerra, the school's acting president. The experience, Dr. Vinciguerra said, would be provided through internship programs and other interaction with commercial companies, ''so we floated the idea of developing a research park on campus.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a Commack-based business group, was asked to prepare a study for the college. It found that the proposed park would help foster the college's already extensive role in preparing skilled workers for the technology-based  manufacturing jobs that had become the bedrock of the Long Island economy.</p>
        <p>''We were already experiencing a shortage of skilled workers,'' Dr. Kamer said,  ''and developing a technical skill base was very important to help stimulate business activity around Route 110 and throughout  Long Island.''</p>
        <p>The study caught the attention of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which had been looking for ways to keep the companies it licenses to develop commercial applications of its scientific discoveries from moving to areas like the 41-year-old Research Triangle Park in the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., area. Out of 11 companies formed around technology developed at the laboratory, only four had remained on Long Island, said Dr. Kamer, who is on the board of the bioscience park.</p>
        <p>ESTABLISHING a close-by bioscience business park where companies could become part of a cluster of science-based enterprises similar to those found in Raleigh, Boston, Princeton, N.J., and other areas was a way of ''keeping our science and our scientists on Long Island,'' said John P. Cleary, chairman of the board of the bioscience park. New York State also saw the potential, and $15 million in state financing was approved for the first building.</p>
        <p>Owned by the New York State University Construction Fund, the structure occupies 5 of 20 acres on the 380-acre campus that have been earmarked for the new park. The building is fully leased, with an anchor tenant, OSI Pharmaceuticals, taking 41,000 square feet under a 20-year lease, and the remaining space leased to three smaller tenants.</p>
        <p>The smaller tenants pay annual rents of $15 to $17 a square foot, about 30 percent below the market rent of $23 a square foot that OSI, as an established company, will pay when it moves in about a year from now. As part of their leases, companies must agree to contribute through student internship programs and with guest lecturers to a biotechnology curriculum that the college expects to begin offering next year.</p>
        <p>Although most of the new space has been taken by one large tenant, the 20-acre site allows up to 200,000 square feet of additional space to be built in two buildings that will be earmarked for small companies, said Greg Blyskal, the executive director of Broad Hollow Bioscience Park. The hope is to get a new building under way within 18 months. The cost, which will depend on size and design, and the financing have not yet been determined.</p>
        <p>''The vital thing is to get a second building going and to continue the development of the cluster idea, because collaboration is one of the reasons companies move to North Carolina, the West Coast and other areas,'' Mr. Blyskal said. ''Science is moving so fast that companies must develop a relationship with other companies in order not to fall behind.''</p>
        <p>Long Island already has several incubators, and more are in the planning stages.  The State University of New York at Stony Brook was the first to develop the idea, and now has two such buildings, one devoted to biotechnology, the other to software start-ups. The university would also manage a proposed business incubator at Calverton, for which $3 million in state financing has been secured. Transfer of the 50-acre Calverton site, owned by the Town of Riverhead, requires approval of the town board. A public hearing is to be held on Nov. 8.</p>
        <p>A 17,000-square-foot software incubator managed by the Long Island Software and Technology Network, known as LISTnet, a private membership group devoted to promoting Long Island's high-tech industry, opened at Briarcliffe College in Bethpage last year. And the North Shore/Long Island Jewish Health System has unveiled plans for an incubator program that would provide 25,000 square feet of new space for start-up companies in biotechnology and biomedical technology. The venture has received a $4.5 million state grant and will be situated on the North Shore University Hospital campus in Manhasset.</p>
        <p>''The incubator concept is definitely growing, because it is such an important concept,'' said Peter Goldsmith, the president of LISTnet, which started with 50 members three years ago and now has 900. ''It's not just the money,'' he added, referring to the fact that incubators usually charge below-market rents. ''It's really about getting the support network that growing companies need.''</p>
        <p>Einhorn Yaffee Prescott Architects of Albany, working with Urbahn Associates of New York City, designed the Farmingdale building as a multitenant structure with 537-square-foot laboratory-equipped modules that could be interconnected depending on how much space a tenant wanted. The main entrance is through a lobby with a 30-foot-high atrium. Two wings lead out from the central spine.</p>
        <p>THE decision to lease all but one wing to OSI Pharmaceuticals grew out of concerns that the company, which had outgrown its 35,000 square feet in Uniondale,  might leave Long Island if it could not find suitable new space. Additionally, a large mature company serving as an anchor ''will develop a momentum'' and will help attract small start-up companies, said Mr. Blyskal, the park's executive director, likening the idea to a shopping mall where a quality anchor tenant helps attract satellite stores.</p>
        <p>''We are cutting back on incubator space for the short term but we are not giving up on the longer-term goal of developing a biotech industry,'' he said.</p>
        <p>OSI, established in 1983, grew out of research developed at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Its products include cancer-fighting drugs and pharmacological agents.  Recently it also took over the management of clinical trials for one of its own drugs used to fight a broad spectrum of cancers,  including lung cancer.</p>
        <p>An additional $8 million in state funds has been obtained for a 13,500-square-foot extension of the Farmingdale building, to be built in the next year, that OSI is to use for its administrative offices, and to tailor the 41,000 square feet in the existing building to the company's requirements.</p>
        <p>The building's three other tenants are  BioSupplyNet, which moved into 1,070 square feet last month; Immuno-Rx, which expects to move into 535 square feet on Nov. 1; and a stem cell company, so new it has yet to be named, that is taking 4,280 square feet and is expected to arrive by the end of the year. Stem cells, the primordial cells from which all others emerge, have the ability to divide indefinitely and offer breakthroughs in treating serious disease. The other 3,000 square feet in the building is common space.</p>
        <p>Two of the three companies grew out of work begun at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. One, BioSupplyNet, publishes a business directory called the Source Book that lists all the materials on the market that scientists might need. The other is the stem cell company.</p>
        <p>Immuno-Rx, which is headquartered in Manhattan and is relocating its research laboratory from Tampa, Fla., to Farmingdale, works on medications that boost the immune response against cancer and certain viral diseases. The original research was developed at the University of South Florida Medical School in Tampa by the company's founder, Dr. John W. Hadden.</p>
        <p>''Having a facility that will house a critical mass of scientific people and that has the support of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory was very important to us,'' said Dr. Harvey J. Brandwein, the company's president, explaining why Immuno-Rx chose to come to Farmingdale.</p>
