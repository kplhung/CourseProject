        <p>For those who ventured here a couple of weeks ago, there was a choice: cheesecake or pizza.</p>
        <p>''You want to know the future?'' Frank Italiano asked as he patted the hood of a $29,000 flame-red Dodge Dakota customized pizza delivery truck parked in a corner of the Atlantic City Convention Center at the Northeast Pizza Expo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Italiano, a designer with Custom Mobile Food Equipment of Hammonton, gazed across the football-field-length of exhibition booths, where arias boomed from loudspeakers hidden in half-scale Italian villas.</p>
        <p>As if the excitment of having 50 Miss America contestants and their entourages, television crews and assorted personnel roaming the city weren't enough, there were about 2,500 pizza makers and restaurateurs here for two days during pageant week -- peering into hi-tech wood-burning ovens and shoveling down sizzling slices made with no-fat eggs, no-skid cheese and no-shrink mushrooms.</p>
        <p>''What we're developing right now,'' Mr. Italiano said, ''is a fully automated, hot-and-cold pizza delivery system where you order your pizza on the Internet, it goes out to the guy in the truck, where the computer plots the fastest route to your house, and a satellite tracking system lets the boss know where he is at all times, just in case he gets lost. He pulls up to your place, presses a series of buttons inside the truck and the pizza is made, baked and boxed while he's sitting in your driveway. Then he just takes it out of the truck, with your drink order, and rings your doorbell.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Italiano's truck drew the eyes, the nose and mouth went right to the pies themselves while exhibitors of toppings cut deals with sauce makers, crust providers and oven salesmen to fashion fresh, baked-on-the-premises pies that would mutually promote their products.</p>
        <p>Even exhibitors selling new and improved pizza boxes, uniforms for their employees and coin-operated ''brain teaser'' machines, seemed to have a pizza nearby.</p>
        <p>''This is a good grazing show,'' said Pete Lachapelle, publisher of the Indiana-based Pizza Today magazine, the show's sponsor and producer. ''There are people here who are passionate about pizza.''</p>
        <p>Passionate and prosperous, Mr. Lachapelle said. Americans spend $30 billion each year on pizza, in 60,000 restaurants with pizza on the menu.</p>
        <p>''Depending on whose numbers you look at, pizza either outsells burgers, or comes pretty close to it, as America's primary fast food.''</p>
        <p>Making that fast food even faster is among the many controversies in the industry, Mr. Lachapelle said, as new ''brick'' pizza ovens, which are made of steel but lined with ceramics, some with internal conveyor belts, promise to cut in the half the traditional eight-minute baking time of the typical 16-inch pizza.</p>
        <p>''The Northeast market, New York and the surrounding areas, is the largest and most conservative pizza market in the country,'' he said. ''This is the stronghold of the traditional pie, made by the mom-and-pop restaurants who have been doing it the same way all their lives and don't want to change, but might have to, because of changes in the kinds of customers they're  getting and a need to offer new menu items to keep up with the chain stores like Pizza Hut and Papa John's.''</p>
        <p>Though pies with rattlesnake or buffalo toppings in cream sauces might be found in a handful of trendy restaurants east of the Mississippi, it is the ''winged pizza that is the hottest category right now, nationwide'' Mr. Lachapelle added. ''Chicken, duck, ostrich. I haven't had anything made with a bat yet, but you never know.''</p>
        <p>Judging from the samples that were quickly disappearing, chicken wings were indeed hot at the booth run by La Nova. ''Wings are the fastest-growing finger food in America, after pizza,'' said Sam Patano, a marketing representative for La Nova, a Buffalo-based pizza restaurant that sells its chicken wings through regional distributors.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Patano offered a recipe for a ''chicken wing pie'' made with deboned chicken wings, carrots, celery, mozzarella, a sprinkling of bleu cheese and hot wing sauce in place of the traditional tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>''You serve it with blue cheese dressing on the side,'' Mr. Patano added.</p>
        <p>Across the hall, R. Blake Christy, an executive with the Bona Vita meatball company of Bridgeton, was offering samples of an arancini, a fist-sized fried ball of rice stuffed with chopped beef, peas and tomato sauce that, he hoped, might rival wings as America's next big finger food.</p>
        <p>''It's tough to pioneer a new item,'' said Mr. Christy as he daubed a sliced arancini with tomato sauce and grated locatelli cheese. ''Four years ago, I was in Sicily with my wife, and this was as popular in Sicily as a hot dog. I decided to make my own version, and I've been banging on doors ever since. I have a distributor that's put them into a supermarket and in one of the casinos down here, but it's still an uphill battle. Right now, I'll be happy if I make enough from these things to take my car payment.''</p>
        <p>In addition to seminars on restaurant marketing and cost-cutting, those in attendance here could learn about hiring, firing and tips on making various kinds of dough.</p>
        <p>Doug Neilsen of Chef Franco's bread bakery in Neptune drew the line at crusts. ''All you need to know about dough I can tell you in one word,'' said Mr Neilsen. ''Water. Genuine, Neptune, N.J., water. That, and how it's proofed. You have to let it sit and be by itself for a while. Let it become itself. Take on a sense of identity.''</p>
        <p>Pizza. Water. Fish. That is where Carol Lisanti, a specialty foods importer from Fairfield, came in. Ms. Lisanti said that these days days, people were not asking to hold the anchovies as much as they used to. ''With pizzas, you still are going to find people who are very divided about anchovies. But with so many health-conscious people eating Caesar salads right now, the good chefs are using the real thing.''</p>
        <p>''What else could you use?'' Fred Seeley, a chef at Frank's Restaurant and Pizzeria in East Hanover, said with a shrug. ''Frozen dough? Fruit and egg on a pizza? Forget about it!''</p>
        <p>Though he was not impressed with an array of dough-making machines and other seemingly labor-saving devices, Mr. Seeley said the temptation to use more prepared ingredients and to automate some of the pizza making process had never been greater for pizza makers.</p>
        <p>''The hardest things to do perfectly are the simplest,'' he said. ''It's hard to get good people -- you train them and then they're gone. The ones who stay must be serious about the work.</p>
        <p>''Pizza,'' Mr. Seely went on, ''must be touched. You must make it with your hands. You cook your sauce for hours until it is thick. You mix your dough and let it rise. You grate your own cheese. You put it together and you bake it slow and then you watch it like a hawk and take it out at the exactly right time.</p>
        <p>''You must make it,'' he said, and paused dramatically, ''with love.''</p>
        <p>Is that to go? Or for here?</p>
