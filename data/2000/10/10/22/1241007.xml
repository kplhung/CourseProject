        <p>James Robison, a television evangelist who once led stadium crusades and is now host of a Christian talk show in Dallas, said he received a phone call last Sunday from a believer who asked if they could pray together.</p>
        <p>It was Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, looking for help in preparing for the third and final presidential debate, Mr. Robison said.</p>
        <p>''I told him, 'You're not going to know every answer to every question,' '' Mr. Robison said, so on the telephone together they prayed for God to grant Mr. Bush ''calm, confidence and the wisdom to know when to speak and when not to speak.''</p>
        <p>As he runs for president, Mr. Bush has turned for advice not just to campaign consultants and briefing books, but also to preachers and Bible passages. He has consulted ministers privately about how to deal with questions about his past drinking and rumors of drug use, and whether he is coming across as humble enough to viewers in television interviews and debates.</p>
        <p>When he was wrestling with the decision about whether to run for president, he asked groups of ministers to pray over him.</p>
        <p>When faced with doubts or challenges, Mr. Bush has often in recent years turned toward religion for guidance, confidence and comfort. That is the portrait that has emerged from interviews with friends, the evangelical pastors he has cultivated and the minister of the Methodist church he belongs to in Dallas. They regard his public references to Christ during the campaign as the sincere confessions of an enthusiastic convert, and not as mere posturing.</p>
        <p>They do not, however, paint him as a choirboy. In fact, they say he turned to God to cope with his own sin. Mr. Bush himself, when asked in interviews about his faith, has for years volunteered the same Bible verse about sin and hypocrisy.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to try to take the speck out of your eye when I've got a log in my own,'' Mr. Bush said again in a telephone interview earlier this year, paraphrasing a New Testament verse from the Book of Matthew. (He declined to be interviewed for this article.)</p>
        <p>The verse is a favorite, he said, because it reassures him that everyone is a sinner. He said he thought of his religious awakening as ''one of the defining moments in my life, but I do so understanding that I am a lowly sinner, as well.''</p>
        <p>Like some kind of religious Rorschach, Mr. Bush has managed to allow spiritual leaders to see in him whatever image of Christianity they prefer. His mainline Methodist minister says he is a nondogmatic moderate. Conservative Southern Baptists see in him a fellow believer in moral absolutes. Charles W. Colson, a Watergate felon turned born-again evangelist, said in an interview that Mr. Bush was ''one of us.''</p>
        <p>If it is difficult to hear the true timbre of Mr. Bush's Christian faith, it may be because he has a gift for emphasizing the universals and avoiding the potentially divisive particulars about what he believes.</p>
        <p>His journey has taken him through a variety of mainline Protestant churches to men's bible study groups, to one-on-one discussions  with the Rev. Billy Graham, to evangelical megachurches, to the Western Wall in Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's father was an Episcopalian, his mother a Presbyterian, and as a child, Mr. Bush attended churches of both denominations. When Mr. Bush married Laura Welch at the age of 31, he joined a Methodist church, and he has remained a Methodist.</p>
        <p>Methodist churches run the gamut from liberal to conservative, depending on the congregation. The congregation where the Bushes found a home, and where they maintain their membership, is Highland Park United Methodist Church in Dallas, where they lived while Mr. Bush owned the Texas Rangers baseball team just before he ran for governor. Mr. and Mrs. Bush regularly sat in the same pew near the pulpit in the transept, next to the door, while their twin daughters attended the Sunday school.</p>
        <p>The church, adjacent to the campus of Southern Methodist University, is in a leafy neighborhood of stately brick homes. The congregation leans Republican and includes more than 200 corporate leaders. But last Sunday, cars in the parking lot sported bumper stickers for the Gore-Lieberman ticket, as well as for Mr. Bush, and the half a dozen stickers about abortion supported abortion rights.</p>
        <p>The church's senior minister, the Rev. Mark Craig, says it is telling that his congregation has not made abortion an issue because there are members on both sides of the debate -- including many who do not want government to intrude -- and many who do not care.</p>
        <p>''This church is middle of the road,'' Mr. Craig said. ''It's a very traditional, very open and accepting church, and it is where Mr. Bush wanted to be. I think he is a moderate. I have no fear of him becoming more dogmatic.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush was elected to his second term as governor in 1998, he asked Mr. Craig to preach at the prayer service the morning of the inauguration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Craig's sermon ''reached out and grabbed me, and changed my life,'' Mr. Bush wrote in his official autobiography, ''A Charge To Keep'' (William Morrow, 1999). Mr. Craig preached about Moses, the reluctant leader, and said that people were ''starved for leadership.'' Mr. Bush wrote that his mother, listening in the pews, later told him that the minister was ''talking to you.'' Mr. Bush attributes his decision to run for president to the sermon that his minister preached that day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush told other ministers that their prayers had given him the peace of mind to run for president. Before the inauguration in January 1999, Mr. Bush met with a group of ministers at the Fellowship Church in Grapevine, Tex., a fast-growing megachurch loosely affiliated with the Southern Baptists.</p>
        <p>In a large classroom, over coffee, about 15 ministers -- white and black, evangelicals and Pentecostals -- quizzed him about his views about the Bible, about abortion and about race, the ministers who were there said. He told them he was considering running for president, but feared the impact on his wife and children. He asked the ministers to pray for his family.</p>
        <p>''I didn't feel like he was trying to sell us a bill of goods, but that he earnestly wanted our prayers,'' said the Rev. Ed Young Jr., pastor of the Fellowship Church. ''I think he's a great representation of a true leader, because of his vision, because he's someone who believes in absolutes and he's not basing his life on relativism.''</p>
        <p>They stood in a circle around him, laid their hands on his body, and prayed for him, the ministers recalled. When they finished, Mr. Bush's eyes were filled with tears, several ministers said.</p>
        <p>There were two more prayer meetings in the next few months, at the governor's mansion the day before the inauguration, and at Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship Church, the pulpit of the Rev. Tony Evans, an influential African-American preacher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush recounted for them the story he often tells about how he turned to Jesus Christ in 1986, when he was 40. He says he was drinking too much, allowing his marriage to go stale, and adrift in his job. That summer, at his parents' summer house in Kennebunkport, Me., he took a walk with Mr. Graham, an old family friend.</p>
        <p>In interviews earlier this year, neither man could remember the content of the conversation. But Mr. Bush, and friends who knew him at the time, say that he returned home to Texas resolved to quit drinking and turn his life around.</p>
        <p>''He wanted to know more,'' Mr. Graham said, ''about what it means to be a Christian, to be a moral leader, and he always impressed me as a man that had his goal of being something more than just the son of George Bush.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that Billy Graham ''planted the seed.'' He said that was the day he decided to ''recommit my heart'' to Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>Those who know him say Mr. Bush goes through phases when he forsakes Bible reading. But in the last year, he has begun reading the ''one-year'' Bible, 365 brief portions that can each be read in a few minutes daily.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he regards the Bible as the literal and inerrant word of God, Mr. Bush said in the earlier interview: ''From Scripture you can gain a lot of strength and solace and learn life's lessons. That's what I believe, and I don't necessarily believe every single word is literally true.</p>
        <p>''I think that, for example, on the issue of evolution, the verdict is still out on how God created the earth,'' he said, a position that separates him from the fundamentalists. ''I don't use the Bible as necessarily a way to predict the findings of science.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush learned a lesson from his first campaign for governor, when he created a controversy by telling an Austin reporter that only those who have accepted Christ as their savior can enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
        <p>''That's a little insight into what he really believes,'' said a friend. ''He quickly learned to shut up so it will never be discussed.''</p>
        <p>Now he declines most requests for interviews about his religion. He gave one in August, to Charisma, a Christian magazine whose audience is Charismatics and Pentecostals.</p>
        <p>''I want to win,'' Mr. Bush said in the interview, ''and I'm a tough competitor, but I also understand that winning this election may not be in the larger plan of things. I think it will be, but it may not be. Prayer helps me keep perspective.''</p>
