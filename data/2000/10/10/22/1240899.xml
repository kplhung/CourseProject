        <p>GENUINE surprises are rare in the auto industry, where secrets are routinely spilled by spy photos, orchestrated news leaks and calculated rumors. Yet Porsche managed to keep its Carrera GT a secret until it was unveiled at the Louvre last month at the opening of Mondial de l'Automobile, the Paris auto show.</p>
        <p>No one was expecting this: a midengine roadster, vacuum-packed in a carbon fiber body, powered by a 5.5-liter, naturally aspirated V-10 producing 558 horsepower and 442 foot-pounds of torque. All that is enough to propel the 2,750-pound car from a standing start to 124 miles an hour in less than 10 seconds, Porsche says, on its way to a top speed of more than 205 m.p.h.</p>

        <p>GENUINE surprises are rare in the auto industry, where secrets are routinely spilled by spy photos, orchestrated news leaks and calculated rumors. Yet Porsche managed to keep its Carrera GT a secret until it was unveiled at the Louvre last month at the opening of Mondial de l'Automobile, the Paris auto show.</p>
        <p>No one was expecting this: a midengine roadster, vacuum-packed in a carbon fiber body, powered by a 5.5-liter, naturally aspirated V-10 producing 558 horsepower and 442 foot-pounds of torque. All that is enough to propel the 2,750-pound car from a standing start to 124 miles an hour in less than 10 seconds, Porsche says, on its way to a top speed of more than 205 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>Wendelin Wiedeking, president and chief executive of Porsche, was careful to note that such numbers were ''provisional,'' and that a production version -- if the car is actually built -- would probably be faster.</p>
        <p>The Carrera GT will almost certainly become available, at a price that executives estimated at $350,000. The car is officially a design study, but it represents too much of the small company's material and emotional capital to be merely a whim. In fact, Dr. Wiedeking explained, the company had mysteriously pulled out of Le Mans competition two years ago -- to the dismay of enthusiasts -- so that its race team could shape this street version of the company's Le Mans prototype car.</p>
        <p>This race heritage is evident in the 14-inch ceramic-composite brakes, 6-speed sequential gearbox and pushrod suspension -- all competition gear of the highest order.</p>
        <p>The car will no doubt reassure some aficionados who saw Porsche's absence from Le Mans, and its new sport-utility project, as signs that the company was losing touch with its sports car heritage.</p>
