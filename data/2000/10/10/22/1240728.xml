        <p>FROM a studio on a narrow porch in Norwalk emerged something of biblical proportions: hundreds of sculptured figures -- each smaller than a Barbie doll -- that could take the observer on a journey from Creation to the Crucifixion and back again.</p>
        <p>For the past four years, the artist Kevin Hanna has labored to create a mixed-media interpretation of stories from the Bible, commissioned by the University of Dayton. In a few weeks, the sculpture is headed for the school for permanent installation in its Roesch Library.</p>
        <p>In late September, the completed sculpture was on display at the Noroton Presbyterian Church in Darien, where Mr. Hanna and his family are members.</p>
        <p>The work, which is untitled, is 8 feet high, 3 1/2 feet deep and 12 feet long. Over all it is in rough pyramidal form, with the gilded city at the top, the creche straight down, as well as in cruciform, with the baby Jesus at the center of the axis. The structure, which is made of clay and wood, has a medieval, German Gothic look to it, like an altar piece. All over the mountain, life teems.</p>
        <p>''There's a solid, magnificent thing about the structure, then the life wiggles, writhes and swarms over it,'' said Mr. Hanna. ''There's a really fun interplay between the laws of the universe with the natural wilderness, spilling over the architecture.''</p>
        <p>After graduating from Brown University with a degree in art, Mr. Hanna set up a studio in Port Chester, N.Y., and explored a wide variety of interests: marionettes, painting, woodworking and theater.</p>
        <p>In the process of experimentation, according to the 46-year-old artist, ''It all came together.''</p>
        <p>''I am religious,'' he said. ''I have a sense of vocation about this. The church I grew up in was sort of Gothic. In some ways my style was always the late Gothic, the Flemish, and American Regionalist as well.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the rounded, undulating masses of people in the latest sculpture are reminiscent of Breugel's people. There are numerous clay figures, both human and animal, all kinds of accessoriesfrom crowns, tiny playing cards, wine jugs, stars with faces, all made by Mr. Hanna.</p>
        <p>While the sculpture portrays stories from the Bible, Mr. Hanna said there was more to it than biblical illustration.</p>
        <p>''I'm using it to give a sense of journey, the cosmos, what life is about,'' he said. ''It's not about doctrine. Plenty of people who would call themselves agnostic would still find something here. The theme is incarnation. It is pantheistic in that respect.''</p>
        <p>Other examples of Mr. Hanna's art can be seen in the State Department and the Kennedy Center in Washington, and the Bowery Mission in Manhattan, among other places. His religious sculptures were used by Time magazine to illustrate its cover story about Easter in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna said he worked only on commission and therefore did not build up an inventory to show in a gallery. He does put together retrospectives to show in not-for-profit venues every couple of years, borrowing from the owners of the works for the exhibits.</p>
