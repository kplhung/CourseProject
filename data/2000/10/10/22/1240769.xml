        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with interest the article on Alberto W. Vilar's generous support of opera and other projects [''So You Can Buy Love After All'' by Allan Kozinn, Oct. 8]. But I feel compelled to comment that critics who choose to question Mr. Vilar's modesty do an injustice not only to Mr. Vilar but to philanthropists and arts organizations everywhere.</p>
        <p>The truth, dramatic as it may sound, is that Mr. Vilar is a recent hero in a history of arts patronage that extends back at least as far as Pericles and the Golden Age of Greece. Without that tradition, stretching over thousands of years, a long list of the world's most treasured artworks would never have come into existence. As a fundraiser with more than 20 years of experience, I can testify that gifts like Mr. Vilar's are extremely difficult to come by -- and are cause for tremendous excitement and celebration for everyone involved.</p>
        <p>Opera is the most expensive and difficult of all disciplines to present because of its scale and production requirements. The only way to cover the costs of this ''high end'' art form, usually, is to rely on the patronage of wealthy individuals who are passionate about the work. (For example, we at the Brooklyn Academy of Music are thrilled to have the opportunity to bring the Glyndebourne Opera to New York for its American debut next spring, but we have been somewhat daunted by the challenge of paying for it. A generous donation from Mr. Vilar has helped to save the day.)</p>
        <p>In fact, it is often we recipients who implore donors like Mr. Vilar to commemorate their largess through the naming of rooms and buildings or other types of visible recognition, because we are eager to thank our patrons and recognize their extremely helpful contributions to the arts they love. It seems quite unfair and unnecessary to analyze their motives for accepting our gratitude. After all, we don't question a tenor's intentions when he steps forward for a curtain call. If great artists deserve our applause, why not great supporters?</p>
