        <p>Even before they arrived at Yankee Stadium, there was no doubt that yesterday was a little different for Mets Manager Bobby Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips. The area was buzzing with baseball.</p>
        <p>''It's more exciting than I imagined,'' Valentine said of taking part in his first World Series.</p>
        <p>Phillips arrived at Yankee Stadium in his car about 4:45 p.m., just before the Mets' team bus pulled in. He tried to sneak into the lot ahead of the bus, pleading with the parking attendant. ''I said, 'I'm the G.M. of the Mets,' '' Phillips said. ''He said, 'Yeah, get out of the way.' ''</p>
        <p>Valentine was also put in his place earlier in the day. He greeted some Japanese friends at the Plaza Hotel in the morning, and they went to Mickey Mantle's Restaurant for an early lunch. With few other patrons in the restaurant, a USA Today reporter doing a story on tickets approached Valentine and his friends. After asking for the names of Valentine's friends, he said, she stunned Valentine by asking for his name.</p>
        <p>''Valentine,'' she repeated. ''Is that spelled like the day?''</p>
        <p>''It was kind of the antithesis of the whole thing,'' Valentine said, laughing.</p>
