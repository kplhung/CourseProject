        <p>IT's a warm September afternoon, a fine day for listening to the Cole Porter melodies that trickle out of one of the spacious studios at American Ballet Theater's headquarters in downtown Manhattan. Inside, the choreographer Christian Holder is rehearsing ''Weren't We Fools?,'' his new ballet for the company's two-week season, which begins on Tuesday at City Center.</p>
        <p>Several Porter compositions, many of them recently rediscovered by the arranger and musical director Judy Brown, are included in Mr. Holder's 35-minute piece, which tells the story of a woman torn between an adoring husband and a former lover and the effect of her conflict on the people around her. For the work's premiere on Friday, the principal dancers Susan Jaffe and Ethan Stiefel will take the roles of the woman and her lover, while the corps member Carlos Molina will play her husband and the soloist Stella Abrera will portray the lover's mistress. In all, the piece is cast for 14 dancers.</p>

        <p>IT's a warm September afternoon, a fine day for listening to the Cole Porter melodies that trickle out of one of the spacious studios at American Ballet Theater's headquarters in downtown Manhattan. Inside, the choreographer Christian Holder is rehearsing ''Weren't We Fools?,'' his new ballet for the company's two-week season, which begins on Tuesday at City Center.</p>
        <p>Several Porter compositions, many of them recently rediscovered by the arranger and musical director Judy Brown, are included in Mr. Holder's 35-minute piece, which tells the story of a woman torn between an adoring husband and a former lover and the effect of her conflict on the people around her. For the work's premiere on Friday, the principal dancers Susan Jaffe and Ethan Stiefel will take the roles of the woman and her lover, while the corps member Carlos Molina will play her husband and the soloist Stella Abrera will portray the lover's mistress. In all, the piece is cast for 14 dancers.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Holder's ballet, the title song, ''Weren't We Fools?,'' and several other little-known Porter songs, including two never published, achieve new life in ballet.  Typically clever and poetic, the unknown songs are woven deftly by Ms. Brown around standards like ''I've Got You Under My Skin'' and ''In the Still of the Night'' to create a highly romantic and dramatic suite. The mezzo-soprano Lynne Halliday, who has collaborated with Ms. Brown on other Porter projects, sings the lyrics, remaining onstage throughout the ballet to give voice to the heroine's tumultuous emotions.</p>
        <p>Porter wrote ''Weren't We Fools?'' in 1927 for his friend, the singer and comedian Fanny Brice to perform at New York's Palace Theater. But its lyrics describing passion for a lost love must have hit too close to home, for when Brice learned that her ex-husband, Nick Arnstein, whom she still loved, would be in the audience the night the song was scheduled, she dropped it from the program and never sang it publicly.</p>
        <p>Each rediscovered song has the distinctive charm and understated intensity that made Porter famous. Active from the 1920's nearly until his death in 1964, he won acclaim for his musical-theater scores, writing now-legendary songs like ''Night and Day,'' ''Begin the Beguine,'' and ''I Get a Kick Out of You.'' The only music he wrote specifically for a ballet, ''Within the Quota,'' in 1923 for Les Ballets Suegravedois, was used again by the choreographer Keith Lee in 1970 for his ''Times Past'' for Ballet Theater. Surprisingly, Murray Louis was the only well-known choreographer to use Porter's songs for a concert-dance piece, ''Canarsie Venus,'' made for Rudolf Nureyev in 1978.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holder leaves the dancers to talk with Ms. Brown during a rehearsal break. Handsomely dressed in shades of gray, he's as commanding at 52 as when he danced with the Joffrey Ballet in the 60's and 70's. She's a cheerful-looking, curly-haired woman, also in her early 50's, who has been studiously taking notes next to the accompanist, David LaMarche, at the piano. She orchestrated ''Weren't We Fools?'' for piano, strings and an unusual assortment of percussion instruments, including timbales, marimbas, Chinese opera cymbals and the Japanese squeeze drum. For a few minutes, she and Mr. Holder discuss tempos that have to be changed to accommodate the choreography's pace.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Holder and Ms. Brown were already Porter aficionados when they first worked together three years ago on a Porter cabaret, for which she arranged the music and he, also a noted costume designer, did the costumes. Mr. Holder grew up in London, where his celebrated parents, the singers, dancers and choreographers Geoffrey Holder and Carmen de Lavallade, used Porter songs in their cabaret acts. Enchanted by the music, young Christian would lip-sync to his parents' recordings of Porter's tunes. And long before starting the ballet, he had practically memorized ''The Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter,'' edited by Robert Kimball, who became a valuable adviser on the project.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown's connection with Porter grew out of her theatrical experience. A classically trained musician and the editor of the recently published songbook ''Cole Porter Rediscovered,'' she has acted as musical director on many shows, including ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''West Side Story'' and ''Dracula.'' When she began to focus on Porter in 1985, Robert H. Montgomery Jr., the trustee of the Cole Porter Trusts, knowing her impressive credentials, gave her carte blanche to delve into the archives and use anything she wished. The blessing of Mr. Montgomery, who died last month, was crucial to the creation of the ballet, which is dedicated to him.</p>
        <p>''When I first heard Judy play Porter on the piano,'' Mr. Holder says, ''she played so strongly, with such movement, that I immediately thought of dance. A while before, hearing Bobby Short sing 'Weren't We Fools?,' it seemed like a great springboard for a full-length ballet. But I hadn't put two and two together. Then one night Judy and I were having dinner and I decided I'd bring it up after our first sip of champagne. Before I got a chance, she said, 'Christian, would you ever consider doing a ballet to Porter songs?' '' He laughs. ''I felt like saying, 'And in what other life did we know each other?' ''</p>
        <p>Not long afterward, they presented a proposal to Kevin McKenzie, the artistic director of Ballet Theater. ''I saw it as a fully realized theatrical piece,'' Mr. Holder says, ''a timeless love story, with a 30's atmosphere, and the dancers glamorously dressed in my designs for evening gowns and black  tie and tails.'' Mr. McKenzie, once Mr. Holder's colleague at the Joffrey Ballet, went for it. Mr. Holder's last work for Ballet Theater, ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' was choreographed in 1993.</p>
        <p>For ''Weren't We Fools?,'' Mr. Holder needed songs with lyrics that could drive the narrative and also be combined into one coherent piece of music. It was now time for Ms. Brown to become an archaeologist. Altogether, Porter's scrapbooks, letters, photographs and 1,000 pieces of music, at least half of them unpublished, are spread over four locations: the Trusts' Manhattan office, the music division of the Library of Congress, the Cole Porter Collection at Yale University and the Shubert Archives in Manhattan. If Ms. Brown didn't know most of their contents before this ballet, she does now. ''I've been on a musicological dig,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Porter usually composed by writing lyrics and music on different pieces of paper before giving them to a copyist. On a few occasions, this led to their permanent separation. For ''Am I in Love?,'' which is unpublished, Ms. Brown had to try out several sets of lyrics before she found those that fit the music. She still hasn't discovered the lyrics for  ''Song,'' the lover's solo in the ballet. ''C. P. Theme,'' the instrumental in the dance's prelude and finale, which is also unpublished, turned up in one of the 200 cartons donated to the music division of the Library of Congress by the music publisher Warner-Chappell when its New Jersey warehouse closed a few years ago. The only work that Porter named for himself, it was, Ms. Brown thinks,  composed for the show ''Mexican Hayride'' in 1944, though all that existed was a melodic line with a couple of chords. She supplied the missing chords.</p>
        <p>The puzzle solving didn't end with matching lyrics and music. Ms. Brown and Mr. Holder also had to make sure the tempos fit the various moods of the story. For example, in the case of the instrumental ''Rap Tap on Wood,'' Ms. Brown slowed down the ragtime rhythms. ''Weren't We Fools?,'' originally jaunty, now has a more melancholy feeling. ''You can't imagine,'' Ms. Brown says, ''how many sunrises Christian and I saw together after sitting up all night at the piano, trying first one melody and then another and moving them from place to place.''</p>
        <p>Porter's enormous output contributed to their quandary. They had at least seven good alternatives for every one piece of music they needed, although hearing the complete ''Weren't We Fools?,'' which Mr. Holder and Ms. Brown hope will be recorded, their choices sound inevitable.</p>
        <p>This is especially true as the drama intensifies halfway through the ballet, where the rehearsal now resumes. When Mr. LaMarche strikes the first notes of the title song, Ms. Jaffe runs to the front of the studio with her arms outstretched, her expression a mixture of hope and apprehension. ''Weren't we fools to lose each other?'' Ms. Halliday sings, ''Weren't we fools to say goodbye?''  Mr. Stiefel follows Ms. Jaffe longingly with his eyes, and Ms. Halliday continues: ''Though we knew we loved each other, you chose another. So did I.''</p>
        <p>Coming to a stop, Ms. Jaffe brings her clenched hands to her chest, the tragic implications of her dilemma pulsing in every muscle of her body, and then turns calmly for one last look at Mr. Stiefel. ''If we'd realized our love was worth defending, then the story's broken threads we might be mending, with perhaps, a different ending, a happy ending. Weren't we fools?,'' Ms. Halliday concludes.</p>
        <p>After several more songs, the rehearsal draws to a close. The dancers begin to leave, only Mr. Holder, Ms. Brown, Ms. Halliday and Mr. LaMarche staying on to re-examine the score. ''It's great having so much attention paid to the music,'' Mr. Stiefel says on his way out. ''They're recreating the whole atmosphere of Cole Porter. It's like he's here.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about the choreographer Christian Holder and his new ballet, set to the music of Cole Porter, misstated his relationship to the dancers and choreographers Geoffrey Holder and Carmen de Lavallade. He is Geoffrey's Holder's nephew, not the couple's son.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 5, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 22 about the choreographer Christian Holder and his new ballet ''Weren't We Fools?,'' set to the music of Cole Porter, misspelled the name of the company for which Porter wrote ''Within the Quota'' in 1923. It was Les Ballets Suedois, not Suegravedois. The article also misstated Mr. Holder's age and referred incorrectly to his costume designs for ''Weren't We Fools?'' He is 51, not 52; the designs were for black tie and tails, not white tie and tails.</p>
