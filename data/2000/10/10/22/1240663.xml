        <p>OUR arrival on Palm Island felt dreamlike. After a five-hour flight from J.F.K. to Barbados and a 45-minute flight on a six-seater plane through a rainstorm from Barbados to Union Island, my friend Deborah Kampmeier and I stepped into a private launch. We were ferried to a small palm-fringed island where a waiter glided across the dock to welcome us with two tall drinks the color of a sunset. A chef knelt behind him stuffing a vivid blue fish into a sack. Alongside the dock rocked a small boat with four fierce, almost mythical-looking, fishermen, one of whom rose to his feet and held aloft a glistening red-gilled barracuda that looked at least five feet long. We clutched our drinks and stared at the barracuda. And at the fisherman. ''You caught that?'' we gasped. ''Speared it!'' he exclaimed, before the boat sped away across the ocean.</p>
        <p>I imagine that most people visit Palm Island, part of the island chain of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the eastern Caribbean, with a husband or wife or lover.

        <p>OUR arrival on Palm Island felt dreamlike. After a five-hour flight from J.F.K. to Barbados and a 45-minute flight on a six-seater plane through a rainstorm from Barbados to Union Island, my friend Deborah Kampmeier and I stepped into a private launch. We were ferried to a small palm-fringed island where a waiter glided across the dock to welcome us with two tall drinks the color of a sunset. A chef knelt behind him stuffing a vivid blue fish into a sack. Alongside the dock rocked a small boat with four fierce, almost mythical-looking, fishermen, one of whom rose to his feet and held aloft a glistening red-gilled barracuda that looked at least five feet long. We clutched our drinks and stared at the barracuda. And at the fisherman. ''You caught that?'' we gasped. ''Speared it!'' he exclaimed, before the boat sped away across the ocean.</p>
        <p>I imagine that most people visit Palm Island, part of the island chain of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the eastern Caribbean, with a husband or wife or lover. But there is something to be said for visiting a luxury resort with a friend; romance would only have distracted me and I wouldn't have appreciated the finer details of the art of pampering as it's practiced on Palm Island.</p>
        <p>Deborah and I were entranced with the fresh fruit shakes, afternoon tea, some of the staff, the wooden shutters in our room, the beds, the pillows, iguanas, the schools of semitranslucent fish that fluttered around us like living hula hoops when we went swimming, and the changeable nature of Caribbean skies during hurricane season.</p>
        <p>Palm Island is just 135 acres with a single resort. One can leisurely circumnavigate the island in about 45 minutes. The resort accommodates 66 guests in its beach-front or palm view wood-and-stone bungalows and the elegant Plantation House. During our visit, which was off season, there were just 18 other guests. There is also a handful of private houses on the island, including a Swiss millionaire's villa.</p>
        <p>We stayed in the Plantation House, in a suite with two queen-size beds, a living area with rattan furniture, a spacious bathroom with hers and hers sinks and bathrobes, a minifridge and a patio with an ocean view.</p>
        <p>No man could have tolerated my rhapsodizing, almost hourly, about how I'd never ever stretched out on such a comfortable bed. Deborah didn't mind. And it didn't bother me that she went on and on about  the gauzy white mosquito netting that  she artfully draped over her bed each  night, even though we saw only one mosquito during our visit.</p>
        <p>While hanging up our clothes in the large closet we planned our activities. Water sports, the nonmotorized kind, and instruction are offered at Palm Island; I wanted to kayak and Deborah would wind surf. We'd definitely go for a ride on the Hobie Cat, and I even considered a round on the resort's five-hole golf course par-3,  perfect for beginners. The last time I tried golf in the Caribbean I had lost six balls by the fourth hole.</p>
        <p>There's a large free-form swimming pool with a waterfall, but we headed straight for the ocean and lolled in classic aquamarine warm water. From nearly every curve on the island one can see other islands in the Grenadine chain; from the main beach it's craggy Union Island where a rocky pinnacle rises above the village like a broken tooth. A final flurry of planning erupted. We'd hike that pinnacle and then go dancing in the local bars.</p>
        <p>After our swim we showered and wrapped ourselves in our white bathrobes. No thick terry cloth here, more of a light waffle weave, the perfect weight for the islands. We angled the wooden shutters in our room just so, mused on the subtle pleasure of Caribbean cross ventilation, and sprawled out and relaxed. We relaxed so deeply that the thought of doing nothing except sleeping, eating and visiting the ocean grew rather appealing. (I spoke to several other guests and they seemed to be suffering from a similar affliction, that of a delicious lassitude that banished all desire for strenuous physical activity.)</p>
        <p>Weather blew in, and the next morning we awoke to a bruised purple sky with banks of black rain-laden clouds approaching -- not a big surprise in September, the Caribbean's stormy month. In between downpours and salt baths -- that's Beverly the lovely housekeeper's word for dips in the ocean -- we roused ourselves for a short walk up the iguana nature trail, one of three small hilly promontories jutting out from the island. We passed cactus plants with blooms that looked almost predatory, and sprays of tiny white flowers filled the air with a jasminelike fragrance.</p>
        <p>There wasn't an iguana to be seen. Instead we saw one near the Swiss millionaire's villa and another climbing one of the thick-leaved sea grape trees on the beach.</p>
        <p>Before afternoon tea we collected the snorkel gear that we would use during our visit and I swam to a small reef a few yards offshore. The coral wasn't in great condition, but following a school of feeding blue tangs and then emerging from the sea in time for a cup of Earl Grey tea and scones felt almost decadent.</p>
        <p>As our interest in strenuous physical activity waned, a keen interest in Palm Island's cuisine developed. I'm embarrassed to admit that at 7 one morning, although the weather had cleared, I announced to Deborah, ''A half hour to breakfast, five and a half hours to lunch, nine and a half to afternoon tea and thirteen till dinner!''</p>
        <p>Stone pathways meander from the rooms to the bar and to the open-air dining room reserved for guests, and to Sunset Beach Restaurant and Bar, just beyond the dock, which is open to day visitors from privately owned and chartered yachts as well as the resort's staff members.</p>
        <p>We were finicky diners, asking Curt, the headwaiter, who took care of us so beautifully, to please add this and leave off that. ''No problem, madame,'' he always said. (That's the sexy French madame, not the staid British madam.) A skinny faxed copy of significant newspaper stories was handed to us every morning at breakfast. Deborah and I are sports fans, the Knicks being her team, the Yankees mine. But even news of Patrick Ewing's trade and the Yankees' slump didn't disturb us for long. How could it, when we were sitting at an ocean-front table with  a view of Union Island, feasting  on sliced mangoes and pineapples, bowls of coconut oatmeal and feathery scrambled eggs?</p>
        <p>We meant to visit Sunset Beach Restaurant, which offers more casual fare, but the elegant presentation of dishes like steamed kingfish, a delicate bouillabaisse, filet mignon, crispy vegetables in herbes provencales, kept us in Curt's domain. During one tableside conversation he mentioned the fresh fish and lobster that, as we had seen on our arrival, are delivered daily to Palm Island. ''Lobster,'' Deborah crooned. That evening, even though they weren't on the menu, Curt arranged for the chef to grill us each two lobster tails.</p>
        <p>Included in a stay at the resort is a day trip to the Tobago Cays, five tiny uninhabited islands surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped reef. They're two miles from the resort, and on our third day under clear skies we set off with James and Leroy, our guides, and seven other guests.</p>
        <p>Beyond the pampered paradise of Palm Island lies the undeveloped, rugged beauty of other islands in the Grenadines, and we had the ocean to ourselves. That is not always the case; in high season, December to April, the Grenadines become a popular destination with the yachting crowd.</p>
        <p>At the cays we passed Mr. Gold Finger, a small anchored boat offering, according to a hand-painted sign, FISH. LAMBI. LABOSTER. GAS.  Lambi is the local word for conch, and two mounds of bleached conch shells on the nearby shore spoke of Mr. Gold Finger's brisk business.</p>
        <p>The first reef I ever snorkeled was Laughing Bird Cay in Belize, and I have yet to visit another area that can match it for brilliant coral, but what Tobago Cays lacked in coral it made up for in the abundance of marine life that I saw during our hour of snorkeling. We picnicked on Jamesby Island, and after lunch Leroy taught us how to pop our ears so we could dive deep and touch the conch shells on the bottom of the sandy lagoon. On our way home we stopped at Salt Whistle Bay on the sleepy island of Mayreau for a swim, and at the harbor at Union island for a peep at the nurse sharks in the pool in front of the Anchorage Yacht Club.</p>
        <p>IF we'd stayed on Palm Island for a week we would have windsurfed and booked time on the one AstroTurf tennis court. We would have chartered the Georgia, a 44-foot sailboat, from Dennis's Hideaway on Mayreau and explored the coves and curves of Petit St. Vincent, Canouan and Mopion. And, no doubt about it, we would have hiked that pinnacle on Union Island. This is what I told Deborah on our last morning on the island.</p>
        <p>I'm usually an energetic traveler who craves adventure, and I was amazed, even a touch embarrassed, that all I'd essentially done was snorkel and eat. In the interest of salvaging my travel dignity I set off for a brisk walk across the golf course, where small high-stepping lizards were streaking across the green. At the far end of the island, on a beach with a view of the Tobago Cays, I came across a hammock slung beneath a small thatched-roof shelter. The beach was deserted, and I eased into the swaying hammock and smiled, knowing exactly how I would have spent my time if we had stayed any longer on Palm Island.</p>
        <p>If you go</p>
        <p>We flew BWIA from J.F.K. to Barbados and then took a Mustique Airways flight from Barbados to Union Island where a Palm island representative met us at the airstrip. Mustique Airways: (570) 595-8869.</p>
        <p>Palm Island is an all-inclusive resort and the rates are per night based on double occupancy. Palmview rooms are $550 until Dec. 20, $720 from Dec. 21 to Jan. 2, $680 from Jan. 3 to April 15. Beach-front rooms are $610 until Dec. 20, $780 from Dec. 21 to Jan. 2, $740 from Jan. 3 to April 15. Plantation Suites are $680 until Dec. 20, $870 from Dec. 21 to Jan. 2, $840 from Jan. 3 to April 15. Instruction in kayaking and other water sports are included.</p>
        <p>All 40 rooms have air-conditioning and ceiling fans but no telephones or television. Calls can be made from the front desk but the rates are exorbitant. We bought phone cards and used the staff pay phone. The flight from Barbados to Union Island is included for stays of seven nights or longer. Reservations for the resort can be made at (800) 858-4618 or (800) 345-0356.</p>
        <p>Charters from Dennis's Hideaway on Mayreau can be booked at the resort or by calling (784) 458-8594.</p>
