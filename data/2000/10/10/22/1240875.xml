        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would like to compliment you on ''Man Against (Ready. Aim. Fire.) Nature,'' (Oct. 1). While it was an unpleasant reality check to those of us who cannot accept hunting as the solution to our wildlife ''challenges,'' it was refreshing to see that so many communities are trying innovative and more humane ideas in an effort to peacefully coexist with nature. The employment of services to redirect the goose population, and the efforts to put deer-repelling reflectors on the roadways are both positive signs that our communities are looking to deal with wildlife in a more compassionate way. The beautiful photograph of Susan Kehoe with Samantha, her neighborhood bear, at last depicts New Jersey's black bear as the gentle, majestic animal that it is, deserving of our state's protection and warranting increased public education to avoid unwanted encounters. We can only hope that as the line continues to blur between development and our last remaining wilderness areas, our state will move ahead with programs like wildlife contraceptives, limited sterilization and finally preservation of open space so that we may live in harmony with these animals into the future.</p>
