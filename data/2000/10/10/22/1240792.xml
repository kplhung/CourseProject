        <p>Reflecting on his career, Sidney Leff, 99, said, ''I knew when to hang out the moon and the stars.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leff was a sheet music illustrator, and it was his job to capture the mood of a song and translate it into a picture. The moon and the stars were popular symbols of idealized romance at the time.</p>
        <p>From 1922 to 1938, he designed covers for more than 1,000 pieces of sheet music, including the hits ''Yes Sir, That's My Baby,'' ''Me and My Shadow,'' and ''Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue.''</p>
        <p>He became friendly with the composers on Tin Pan Alley and the producers of Broadway reviews, working steadily as long as Americans were buying sheet music to entertain themselves at home.</p>
        <p>When radio came on the scene, and the public no longer played the piano in their living rooms for entertainment, Mr. Leff bailed out of the business and began a second career in advertising, becoming a junior partner at Picard, Marvin &amp; Redfield, a Manhattan-based agency. He designed the art for ad campaigns there for 15 years.</p>
        <p>''I'm a lucky guy -- what can I tell you, I'm just lucky,'' he said in an interview in his apartment in the Cambridge House, a retirement complex here.</p>
        <p>''I had two prestigious professions. And I had a wonderful wife, and I have children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.''</p>
        <p>His apartment holds scrapbooks filled with his work. Coffee mugs embossed with reproductions of the designs from the songs he illustrated line the shelves, as do books about collectibles that give him prominent mention.</p>
        <p>His late wife's abstract paintings hang on the wall next to enlargements of his music illustrations.</p>
        <p>''I took piano lessons as a child and hated it,'' he recalled with a laugh. ''But I did love art, and that's what I was good at, so that was my relationship to music -- I could illustrate just about any song. Irving Berlin liked what I did. So did the producer Billy Rose. I knew all the greats in the business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leff was born in 1901 in Brooklyn, where his father owned a wholesale poultry business.</p>
        <p>By the time he was a teenager he knew he wanted to be an artist and attended a vocational high school for the arts on 138th Street and Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>''It was the only one with really good art courses,'' he said, ''so I had to go on the subway for an hour each way.''</p>
        <p>After graduating he answered a newspaper advertisement placed by Sam Coslow, a songwriter in need of an illustrator. Mr. Coslow showed him lyrics -- he doesn't recall what they were -- and he did a little sketch and that was the beginning.</p>
        <p>Generally each piece of work was done the same way. A writer or music publisher gave Mr. Leff the words, and he would go to his studio and do a rough sketch in pencil. Next came the final draft in colored pen and ink. Usually he needed only lyrics to work from -- ''I was too busy to listen to the music'' -- but there were a few exceptions.</p>
        <p>''Irving Berlin insisted I listen to him play the tune on the piano,'' he said. ''He and I became very close. He was very concerned that I capture visually what he did on a song.'' For one cover, Mr. Leff simply put Mr. Berlin's photograph inside an Art Deco sketch of a frame.</p>
        <p>Photographs of other big-name musicians and songwriters were sometimes used on covers as well, but most often it would be a drawing. Flapper girls, with their bobbed hair, short skirts and flirtatious expressions, dominated the 1920's. In the 1930's, stylized, elongated ladies and gentlemen in evening wear were popular. And whenever romance was implied -- as it often was in popular songs -- a crescent or full moon and a few stars viewed through an open window could do the trick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leff also became known for his Art Deco abstract designs, geographic shapes in the background with perhaps a representational figure in the foreground.</p>
        <p>In ''Underneath the Harlem Moon,'' a woman in tones of white and gray dances against a black background studded with five-pointed stars above a gray New York City skyline. In the July 1994 issues of Metropolis magazine, Hal Glatzer, a journalist and jazz guitarist, calls the illustration ''an Art Deco classic.''</p>
        <p>In other works, the images are more literal and sometimes hint at a story. For ''Yes Sir, That's My Baby,'' Mr. Leff drew a flapper with a cloche and short wraparound cloak against a background that looks like Main Street, Small Town, U.S.A. -- little houses, shops, a white church with a steeple. The impression is that this young woman is both sexy and modern but also innocent. For ''Me and My Shadow,'' Mr. Leff drew exactly that: a man in a blue suit and hat, walking in front of a stone wall on which his gray shadow is clearly cast as he strolls down the avenue.</p>
        <p>''The picture had to sell the song,'' he said, explaining that his early work prepared him for the advertising career he had later. In terms of life style, however, the two professions could not have been more different.</p>
        <p>''Madison Avenue was much more conservative, intellectual, cultured, and it was strictly 9 to 5,'' he said. ''But show business, Broadway, was so much more spontaneous and creative. When I stopped doing sheet music illustrations, I really missed that life. We would hang out all night at places like the Algonquin, just talking. It was fun, creative, a gay, lovely time.''</p>
