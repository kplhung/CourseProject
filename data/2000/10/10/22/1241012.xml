        <p>At New Salem Missionary Baptist, the little country church in Tennessee where Senator Albert Gore's private funeral was held, folks were not at all sure that a woman should be allowed to speak from the pulpit, even if she was an Episcopal bishop, in from Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>And some mourners on the other side of the cultural and religious divide that day did not understand them or their point of view. ''At the New Salem Bible Thumping Good News Evangelical High Hope Church -- it had one of those names,'' Vice President Al Gore's Harvard mentor and friend Martin Peretz said, laughing, ''there was a little bit of anxiety'' about whether she would be allowed to preach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, though, had spent all his life straddling the two worlds -- of Tennessee and Washington, high church and low, gut-level religion and Ivy League intellectualism. So when they collided, perhaps inevitably, on that of all days, two years ago in December, he knew how to bridge the gap. He suggested that the Tennessee preacher ask himself, ''What would Jesus do?'' And in the end, Bishop Jane Holmes Dixon did speak at the service.</p>
        <p>Those close to the famously scientific-minded vice president, a man who by his own estimation is sometimes a little too rational, say he had not just picked up the right words to use on that occasion, but is himself a believing Southern Baptist whose faith drives him. Yet his Baptist roots are only one part of an intricate and eclectic spiritual life, one that from the start mirrored his larger experience of growing up in two places.</p>
        <p>For two weeks every summer as a youngster, he was a regular at the revival meetings at New Salem, near his family's farm outside Carthage, Tenn. ''We'd be in the middle of getting the tobacco crop in, and I'd carry Al with us,'' his closest childhood friend, Steve Armistead, said.</p>
        <p>Then, come winter, he would be back at St. Albans prep school in Washington, attending daily chapel services -- Episcopalian services -- at the National Cathedral, where even whispering was not allowed. The school's hymn went, ''Men of the future stand / And watch each fleeting hour / To make your lives what God has planned, / To spread abroad his power. / In work, game or play, / Suppress all fear and hate. / Show forth a generous spirit true / For God and for the state.'' Not only was religion here served much less raw, in other words, but it was explicitly linked to secular power.</p>
        <p>''I had a real smorgasbord of religious experiences,'' Mr. Gore said in a recent interview about his faith. ''On Sundays in Washington I'd go to the Presbyterian Church around the corner from the Fairfax,'' the hotel where his family lived during the school year, ''and in Carthage we'd alternate between my mother's Church of Christ and my father's Baptist church. Except when we went to the Methodist church.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has continued to branch out over the years, too, studying mysticism as well as ethics, his primary focus during three semesters at Vanderbilt Divinity School, and at least toying with New Age ideas. He also took a course called Theology and the Natural Sciences and, over time, came to see environmentalism as a religious obligation to protect creation. His 1992 book about the environment, ''Earth in the Balance,'' is suffused with ecospirituality. And clearly, his faith is still in flux.</p>
        <p>His oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, said his spiritual search reminded her of the year he spent trying to decide whether to enlist in the Army. ''I remember hearing about the way he was thinking about going to Vietnam, and there's a similar strain in how he's open to religious faith,'' she said. ''There's a discomfort with being so sure about something. I see him searching, seeking and striving and don't see his faith as static.''</p>
        <p>By definition, of course, religious belief is interior, personal, not necessarily a matter shared easily or even at all. But when Mr. Gore talks of his faith he is not so much reticent -- though he is that, too, sometimes -- as he is restless, unfinished.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff suggests that even this corner of life is an avenue of self-improvement for her father. ''There's such an aspirational, striving element to his,'' she said. ''Of, on your own or in public life, reaching toward an ideal, even if we don't get there.''</p>
        <p>Though she sees the fact that he is still seeking as evidence of his openness, flexibility and tolerance, it might just as easily come across as another way in which Mr. Gore seems like a 52-year-old man who does not yet fully know himself.</p>
        <p>''If you're Joe Lieberman, you're done, you're not searching outside the boundaries of your faith,'' said one of Mr. Gore's friends, adding that the vice president is not at all done and is still on that quest.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore considers himself a born-again Christian, among even close friends there is some difference of opinion about whether he is a believer or someone who believes in believing, who respects and admires faith in God but finds the required leap outside his head a long, long way to go.</p>
        <p>And because of his spiritual openness, when he talks about being influenced by his faith it is difficult to say exactly what that means. Ms. Schiff says that faith ''drives him.''</p>
        <p>''He's driven by some calling in life and I really don't know whether it's that he has to be president of the United States, but he definitely feels compelled to serve his faith,'' she said. But how?</p>
        <p>Hard as it is to draw many straight lines between Mr. Gore's religious views and his public life, the one public policy exception, the single place where Mr. Gore does seem to see an explicit link between God and government, is the environment. This, for him, is where God and science seem to meet. Should Mr. Gore lose in November, Ms. Schiff said, ''I could see him pursuing environmentalism and theology in some way.''</p>
        <p>He is certainly fascinated by the unseen, in science as in the spirit, and by all accounts does not see a conflict between the two. In fact, he speaks of both realms in roughly equivalent ways, reverently. And the way he talks about his spiritual life suggests he feels that this, too, is a subject in which he is taking a test with right and wrong answers.</p>
        <p>It is also another area of his life in which much that he says is real but some is enhanced. In a recent interview, he clearly suggested that he goes to church regularly, even in the heat of the presidential campaign, though his own daughter says otherwise.</p>
        <p>''We used to go to church every single Sunday, but since we moved in the vice-presidential house and they had a change of pastor they haven't found a church,'' she said. ''Now we go in Tennessee and on special occasions in Arlington.'' They moved, of course, after the 1992 election, and the pastor she was referring to retired in 1991.</p>
        <p>A Question of Interpretation</p>
        <p>Asked if he believed in a literal interpretation of the Bible, Mr. Gore paused, took a moment and then said, ''Well, I don't believe in the literal interpretation of the word 'literally.' ''</p>
        <p>Was he hedging? Joking about hedging, a la ''that depends on what the meaning of 'is' is?'' Or making the point that even many theological conservatives understand the Bible metaphorically? That's open to interpretation, of course, like so much about the vice president.</p>
        <p>''Everything in the Bible makes sense to me,'' Mr. Gore went on. ''I interpret it my own way, and that's what my tradition teaches me to do. There are poetic passages that speak eloquently to me with meanings that transcend the literal words. In Genesis, for example, God creates this, that and the other in one day, two days, and that represents an order in creation that's perfectly evident to my heart.''</p>
        <p>But are those passages symbolic stories, or based on historical events? He sighed. ''They are lessons about passages in the human story that actually took place, and they're redolent with layers and layers of meaning because they represent not only the events nominally described.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's daughter Ms. Schiff cut to the chase: ''I remember as a teenager getting all hopped up about not wanting to go to church and literal Bible stories and religion as an agent of evil, and he always engaged me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Her father, she added, made clear that ''it didn't matter at all if it was literal. Its power was in the ability to connect us, to bring out the best in each soul, and, for some, in Christianity.''</p>
        <p>Moderate Baptists like Mr. Gore generally do not take the Bible literally. But he seems conflicted, if not about his beliefs then certainly over how to talk about them. He readily agreed to be interviewed about his faith. Yet in the interview, he said he felt he had to be careful.</p>
        <p>''The context makes it appear I'm opening up in a naked attempt to manipulate other believers by ballyhooing my relationship with God, and I'm not going to do that,'' he said. ''To describe the innermost details in the weeks leading up to Election Day contextually invites cynicism.''</p>
        <p>The very next thing he said, though, was this: ''I want people to see my experience as what it is, the most important thing in my life.''</p>
        <p>The Theologian in the Family</p>
        <p>Al Gore did not inherit his faith from his parents, but came to it on his own. His mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, and his father, the senator, were ''turned off'' to organized religion, according to Ms. Schiff.</p>
        <p>''My grandmother told me her mother was very religious and she might have reacted a bit against that,'' Ms. Schiff said. ''My grandfather was an early supporter of Al Smith and John Kennedy and remembered the intolerance toward Catholics, and that turned him off to the old-time religion of the Bible Belt, whereas my father saw good in it.''</p>
        <p>Even as a boy, young Al was more interested in religious themes than the rest of his family. And by his early teens he was spending hours with his Tennessee girlfriend's staunch Baptist grandmother, Edna Armistead, and quizzing her about Scripture.</p>
        <p>At Harvard, Mr. Gore's roommate, John Tyson, would sometimes find him reading the Bible, he said. ''His thing was that even though man has become civilized, evil can still rise up inside a person or a group, so there has to be prayer and vigilance to cultivate the soul. The soul doesn't cultivate itself.''</p>
        <p>He does not ever seem to have had a crisis of faith, though he says he did drift a bit as a young adult. Has he never been mad at God, then? No, he said. ''I don't think I've ever dared feel that emotion.''</p>
        <p>Right after his college graduation in 1969, he went into the Army. And he apparently did, as he said, drift a bit. Marny Hendrick, who worked and shared a barracks with him at Fort Rucker, Ala., said, laughing: ''I don't ever remember the conversation going that way. We were 20 and 21, classically unchurched. I don't think we had a Bible in the room.'' Though most of them, Mr. Gore included, were headed to Vietnam, Mr. Hendrick said, ''We approached it more from a political standpoint.''</p>
        <p>When he got back from Vietnam, however, Mr. Gore headed straight to Vanderbilt Divinity School, where he studied for a little over a year. He has said he was struggling to make sense of the war and the morality of his role in it.</p>
        <p>But the former dean of the divinity school, Walter Harrelson, now retired, said he thought Mr. Gore had more practical motivations.</p>
        <p>''He was taking stock, and the divinity school at that time was full of such people, but it never seemed to me he came with existential angst; he was much more self-possessed than that,'' said Mr. Harrelson, who also got to know Mr. Gore socially.</p>
        <p>''He knew he wanted a life in public service and knew he needed to make sense of his religion -- what it was and what was its place in his life,'' he continued. ''He was not a person in crisis. He did come with a somewhat compartmentalized perspective on life, and he was concerned to integrate his faith and his aspirations to serve society.''</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt's divinity school had, and still has, a theologically liberal reputation, and among its professors there was a lot of interest in the Social Gospel movement, which emphasizes the duty of followers of Christ to care for the poor and powerless.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was much taken with this, Mr. Harrelson said, and sat in on his course on the prophets, where he appeared fascinated by the stories of Amos and Hosea and Micah and their concern for the oppressed.</p>
        <p>For him, these prophets were ancient populists, effortlessly assimilated into his political worldview. And the Christianity he has always felt most comfortable showing in public understands the Jesus story in highly political terms.</p>
        <p>Yet he was still straddling two worlds, still also powerfully attracted to what his daughter calls the old-time religion.</p>
        <p>Born Again</p>
        <p>At around the same time he was pursuing graduate-level theological studies, in his early 20's, Mr. Gore became a born-again Christian.</p>
        <p>When first asked if he considers himself born again, Mr. Gore said, ''I never talk about that unless I'm asked a direct question with the use of that phrase, because people have a lot of meanings they attach to that phrase.'' Then he waited to be asked the direct question, again, before saying, ''Yes, I do.''</p>
        <p>For him, he said, being born again ''means coming into a new awareness of a personal relationship with God at a time in your life you're more capable than you were as a child.''</p>
        <p>But he declined to say how it happened or what called him to renew his faith at that moment. ''I'm afraid it will be misinterpreted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He was already married by then, and he and his wife, Tipper, were back at New Salem, where his grandparents had worshiped, where he had gone to revivals as a child, and where he would later decide to have his father's funeral. The minister at that time was Brother Kenneth Gibbs, he said -- ''a truck driver during the week, a fire-and-brimstone preacher, and a good one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that when he and his family moved to Arlington, Va., in 1977, after he was first elected to Congress, Karenna, then 4, cried that she did not like the Episcopal church they tried attending. ''I want Brother Gibbs,'' she said tearfully, according to her father. (''I still kind of like those eye-popping sermons,'' Ms. Schiff says now.)</p>
        <p>So they tried to accommodate her, he said, and switched to Mount Vernon Baptist, a small faith community near the Pentagon, where the congregation is relatively transient. That is where both Al and Tipper Gore were baptized by full immersion in the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>James Dunn, former executive director of the liberal Baptist Joint Committee in Washington and now a visiting professor at Wake Forest University Divinity School, filled in at Mount Vernon Baptist when the regular minister, the Rev. Jack Turner, was away. He said of Mr. Gore: ''That was his happy church. Jack had a great influence on Al and Tipper, not in some mystical, pious way, but he was the first pastor they had together who was a good friend.''</p>
        <p>''Al's parents were never in the same church and Tipper had had a distant religious experience, and that's why it was so special,'' Mr. Dunn went on. ''Jack helped them understand what baptism meant in Baptist life -- that it's symbolic, not salvific; it's a public statement -- and they said, 'We understand this now, we do believe in the resurrection.' The purpose of it is to say to the world, 'I'm now following Jesus Christ.' ''</p>
        <p>So, wearing heavy white robes, they waded into the church's baptistry, standing in water up to their shoulders, and were leaned back into the water by Mr. Turner.</p>
        <p>At least for a while, Mr. Gore was also a member of a small prayer group on Capitol Hill, where men read the Bible together and called one another to account when necessary. He would not talk about this either, other than to confirm that he took part and say that he got a lot out of it.</p>
        <p>But he has often said he leaned heavily on church friends and fellow believers when his son, 6-year-old Albert Gore III, was hit by a car in 1989. According to several friends, Mr. Gore absolutely believes that God saved his son and that the power of prayer helped heal him.</p>
        <p>''He may not use the word 'miracle,' '' Mr. Dunn said, ''but he believes Al's life was saved by more than medical explanation.''</p>
        <p>God and the Environment</p>
        <p>It was that crisis that prompted Mr. Gore to write ''Earth in the Balance,'' an environmental book full of spiritual references. Initially, he had envisioned an even more religious book. ''I had some concern about this,'' said his editor, John Sterling. ''How do we present this book seriously if we work a lot of spiritual stuff in?''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Sterling said he did his best to rein in that impulse, God remained a main character in the book. In it, Mr. Gore explains why, for him, God and environmentalism are inextricably linked: ''How can one glorify the Creator while heaping contempt on creation? How can one walk humbly with nature's God while wreaking havoc on nature?''</p>
        <p>He says Noah was an early environmentalist, after God gave him ''a commandment that might appear in modern form as, Thou shalt preserve biodiversity.'' To Mr. Gore, the Bible carries a ''strong activist message.''</p>
        <p>''It is my own belief that the image of God can be seen in every corner of creation, even in us, but only faintly,'' Mr. Gore wrote, in what seems to be as close to a statement of core religious belief as anything else he has ever said or written. ''By experiencing nature in its fullest -- our own and that of all creation -- with our senses and with our spiritual imagination, we can glimpse, 'bright shining as the sun,' an infinite image of God.''</p>
        <p>A Believer and a Dissenter</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has not been active in church for a decade, and acknowledges a new distance from his larger faith community. The once liberal Southern Baptist Convention, which filed briefs in Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade and opposed the war in Vietnam, has more recently been dominated by fundamentalists, leaving moderates like Mr. Gore in the clear minority. Just last week, Jimmy Carter left the Southern Baptist Convention, saying he felt excluded by the adoption of ''increasingly rigid'' policies, including its declaration two years ago that women should be subservient to their husbands.</p>
        <p>In a conversation over dinner months ago, the vice president suggested that he had qualms similar to Mr. Carter's. However, when asked again about those comments in the interview for this article, he said no, he was perfectly comfortable as a dissenter from the majority view on a number of questions.</p>
        <p>In any case, like many of his generation, he is not someone whose faith seems integrally linked to a particular institution. But he is still the most prayerful member of his family, just as he was as a child; Ms. Schiff says that her father and her younger sister Sarah are more observant than she and other members of the family are.</p>
        <p>''We try and rotate so it's not always my dad'' who says the blessing before meals or at special moments, she said, ''because he's always the most enthusiastic. If someone initiates it, it's always my dad.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore says he often turns to the Bible for answers to some of life's hardest questions. He did that, he said, after the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado.</p>
        <p>''I read again the account of Cain slaying Abel,'' Mr. Gore said. As he began quoting from Genesis, he asked his interviewer to follow along -- ''Do you have your Bible?'' -- as he told the story of Cain, whose gift to God was rejected, killing his brother Abel, whose gift was accepted.</p>
        <p>''If you do well, you will be accepted,'' Mr. Gore quoted from memory. ''If you do not do well, sin croucheth at your door . . . and thou shalt rule over'' sin. ''Now, here's how I read it,'' he went on, talking about the young men responsible for the Columbine killings. ''Those two boys in trench coats felt like what they had to offer in life was being rejected, and that made them vulnerable to sin.'' They still failed, though, he said, ''in their duty to rule over it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's friend and mentor Mr. Peretz had already mentioned a discussion he had had with Mr. Gore about this very passage -- and his own question about whether God had been wrong to have refused Cain's gift in the first place. Why had God preferred Abel's live offering, an animal sacrifice, to Cain's fruits of the field?</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Peretz's line of thinking was repeated to Mr. Gore, he batted it right down. ''This passage'' -- about the killing of the shepherd Abel by Cain, who tilled the ground -- ''is a metaphorical reference to the move from a herding to an agricultural economy,'' he said, somewhat impatiently.</p>
        <p>In the current campaign, Mr. Gore has talked about God sparingly, and, though he did quote from the book of Matthew in one debate, certainly less frequently than either his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, or his own running mate, Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>When asked, though, how he had reacted when Mr. Bush answered a question in a debate during primary season by saying that his favorite philosopher-thinker was Jesus, Mr. Gore said: ''I wasn't discomfited by his answer. I don't think of Christ first and foremost as a philosopher, but it's a perfectly good answer.''</p>
        <p>Could a candidate -- a theoretical candidate, of course -- have no set religious beliefs, or odd or murky ones, or rather than beliefs, just hopes? Sure, he said, and riffed for a while about the faith of presidents past. Then he added, ''I have a defined set of beliefs, but I also believe the eternal truths are difficult if not impossible to capture in language.''</p>
        <p>This is the last article in a series about the life of Al Gore. The final installment of ''Governor Bush's Journey'' will focus on his decision to run for president.</p>
