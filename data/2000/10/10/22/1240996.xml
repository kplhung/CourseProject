        <p>The school has needed reinvention for some years.</p>
        <p>In the days when it was Manual Training, I lived in an apartment building at 474 Fourth Street, just up the block from the school. My four-story apartment house was one of three torn down to make way for the extension of the school.</p>
        <p>One afternoon, while I was riding a scooter on Seventh Avenue, a riot broke out among the school's students and I'll never forget one student being hit over the head by an ice-cream store's metal sign.</p>
        <p>Because of similar incidents at the time, I made up my mind to secure a scholarship at a school away from the neighborhood so I wouldn't have to attend Manual Training. So I have always since been grateful to the school for spurring my intention to secure a scholarship to Xavier High School in Manhattan.</p>
