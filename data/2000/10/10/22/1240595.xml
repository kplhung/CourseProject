        <p>Glory Goes and Gets Some</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By Emily Carter.</p>
        <p>239 pp. Minneapolis:</p>
        <p>Coffee House Press. $20.95.</p>
        <p>If you were in rehab, you would want Gloria Bronski, the ex-drug-addict heroine of Emily Carter's first collection of stories, in your group therapy sessions. Carter's narrator relates even her lowest moments with lucidity and comic panache. She's also a trustworthy guide to the recovery process itself, suspicious of A.A. sloganeering but wise to the redemptive powers of the 12-step process.</p>
        <p>Glory, as Carter calls her, has quite a lot to recover from. Despite the ministrations of her wealthy New York parents, she has spent most of her 30-odd years lurching through disastrous relationships and even more disastrous addictions, and has ended up H.I.V. positive and about as near to homeless as a child of Park Avenue can be. Most of the stories narrate Glory's slow crawl to stability in her adopted home, Minneapolis, where she works at odd jobs and tries to kindle a romantic life that can survive her infection. She's in good company: Carter describes the city as a sort of Oz for recovering addicts, filled with strung-out refugees from the East and West coasts who flock to its many clinics seeking hits of Midwestern rectitude and sobriety. Glory's peers include Matthew, a gentle computer technician and sex addict whom Glory befriends ''as a penance for having wanted to hang out with the cool kids,'' and Zemecki, so immersed in his lonely torpor that he cannot invite an acquaintance from his therapy group out for a nonalcoholic beer: ''Somehow making a phone call would be advertising his friendless state. Besides, when he looks at the phone it seems to gather density, like a small piece of galactic matter that, while only the size of a paperweight, weighs the same as Jupiter. Who could lift that?''</p>
        <p>Glory, though, is the undisputed star of the book. The Alcoholics Anonymous credo devotes no fewer than seven of its famous 12 steps to self-assessment and penance, and accordingly the collection's strongest motif is the now-recovering Glory's shame at her previous conduct. Unlike many of her peers in the literature of addiction, with their fond, lyrical descriptions of being high, Glory is more sickened than nostalgic about her benders: ''Just imagine some woman you saw in a bar once, hair tumbled and greasy, eye makeup hopeful the day before yesterday, loudly tossing inappropriate remarks into the closed circles of other people's conversations. Her charming and incisive bon mots land on the floor with an unpleasant splat, as if someone had just hurled a dead frog to the ground at your feet; you turn around, and there she is, smiling like the belle of the ball. If you wish she'd just go away, believe me, so do I.'' This clearsightedness and lack of self-pity keep Glory's tough-broad swagger convincing and fuel some terrific one-liners. ''I was even worse than a rich girl,'' Glory remarks. ''I was that most useless and helpless of all things: a rich girl with no money whatsoever.''</p>
        <p>When the stories sag -- and they do in places -- it's because Carter is coasting by on attitude alone, delivering set pieces and flippant, overly cute commentary. A few selections feel more like spoken-word rants than fleshed-out stories. Worse, Carter recounts some of Glory's most intriguing moments with mysterious, disappointing stinginess. In the collection's final stories, Glory surprises us by marrying Stephen, a fellow former addict and H.I.V. sufferer. Glory mockingly imagines her mother's reductive first assessment of him: ''Male, 35. . . . Judeo-negative. . . . Ivy League negative. . . . Symptoms identical to offspring 1: Chemical dependence, human immunodeficiency virus.'' But Carter never tells us much more about him. The marriage hums along nicely until the couple sample a new kind of treatment cocktail, which works on Stephen but not on Glory. As his viral load drops, he loses sexual interest in her, first explaining that he's reluctant to risk passing new strains between them and finally confessing that her infection level makes him see her as tainted. His admission, as well as Glory's response, are devastating, but not as devastating as they might be if we knew something more about Stephen.</p>
        <p>There's little doubt that Carter could tell us. Some of her stories seem to be fictional in only the most generous sense. Carter's travails have already been written about by her mother and sister, the feminist essayists Anne and Katie Roiphe. These sources (particularly ''Fruitful,'' Anne Roiphe's meditation on motherhood, and Katie Roiphe's ''Last Night In Paradise,'' a treatise on safe sex that was precipitated in part by Emily's illness) reveal that Glory's background is nearly identical to that of her creator.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Carter previously published one of the stories here, ''The Bride'' -- which fills the reader in on Glory's torturous adolescence, alcohol- and heroin-addled 20's and the discovery of her infection -- with the narrator referring to herself as Emily. But this is no cozily nepotistic publishing family. ''The Bride'' includes a damning description of Glory/Emily's mother as ''the doe-eyed, sensitive, feminist, gentle-voiced vision of an America without harsh-toned women cutting coupons in poorly lit Flatbush Avenue kitchens.'' This is a mother who usually accessorizes her remarks with ''elaborate bouquets of wealthy-hippie verbal foliage'' but who berates her daughter for losing a pair of expensive skis by sighing, ''I guess it's God's little joke on me that you turned out to be the sorrow of my life.''</p>
        <p>We never learn if Glory and her mother make peace. The elder Bronski flits in again late in the book, but only to appraise Stephen, and too quickly to provide any narrative or emotional resolution. This is frustrating: we have followed our voluble, revealing protagonist through 18 stories and countless remarks about her estrangement from her family, so when Glory suddenly reintroduces her mother we feel entitled to know whether and how the two have reconciled. Like the faint portrait of Stephen, this blank spot gives the collection a frustratingly unfinished feel. Perhaps Carter should have written a novel instead of a collection of linked stories; the unified format might have kept her from cutting narrative corners. But whatever medium she chooses, and whether she speaks through an invented voice or her own, Carter's voice is welcome, and one can only hope that she will speak up again sometime soon.</p>
