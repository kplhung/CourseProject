        <p>Last month Cincinnati became the first city to use the three-digit 511 telephone number to provide travelers with reports on traffic and road conditions, public transportation and other information. The number will gradually be introduced all across the country.</p>
        <p>In August, the Federal Department of Transportation approved $5 million for the project, which helps public agencies change the more than 300 existing 7-  and 10-digit traveler-information telephone numbers to 511. The project organizers expect to establish and test the service in four more cities -- San Francisco, Minneapolis, Phoenix and Detroit -- by Oct. 1, 2001. Similar traffic and transportation reports are available in the Cincinnati area on 211, but that number will soon be switched over to other purposes.</p>

        <p>In August, the Federal Department of Transportation approved $5 million for the project, which helps public agencies change the more than 300 existing 7-  and 10-digit traveler-information telephone numbers to 511.

        <p>The 511 project is being organized by the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, which was formed by Congress in 1991 to apply technology to increase the safety and efficiency of surface transportation. The society's membership is divided equally between high-tech private companies and such public-sector organizations as universities and state and local governments.</p>
