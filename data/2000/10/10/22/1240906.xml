        <p>I FIRST became concerned two years ago, when my daughter, who was 11 at the time, came home from a house party where the children had a choice of swimming in the pool or at the family's private beach.</p>
        <p>Today, my children's best friends sometimes aren't around because they're in Europe or skiing in Vail. My own children have been to Paris twice in the last three years. Everyone's cars are new and nobody does without. When my sons asked for the scooters that are so popular now, I said no, they were too expensive. So a boy who had three offered to give them one.</p>
        <p>In a nation where many people are enjoying increasing affluence, there is some concern that our children are growing up with a skewed sense of the world -- that while they indeed see Oz, they will insist that it's real even after they wake up. In this surreal economic expansion, how do we show our children that life won't always be this easy, and how do we prepare them for economic reality if they don't believe us?</p>
        <p>''They can end up having no sense of the value of money,'' said Marcee Yager, a financial planner and managing partner of Sterling Wood Financial in San Mateo, Calif. ''One thing about human nature in regard to money, the more effort it takes to obtain something, the more value it has to you. With kids who are surrounded by a lot of wealth, they get stuck in a psychological prison because how do they then get anything that is valuable?''</p>
        <p>Affluence is a problem that we all should have, but this may be a case of too much of a good thing. It's great that we can provide for our families and that money has given us more freedom to fully enjoy our lives, but are our lifestyles giving our children a goal or an excuse?</p>
        <p>Jeffrey H. Bergstrand, associate professor of finance and business economics at the University of Notre Dame, said that children were just reacting rationally to our wealth. That is especially true for teenagers, who may eschew the important experience of a summer job.</p>
        <p>''This is a classic backward-bending labor supply curve,'' Mr. Bergstrand said. ''The more you get paid, the more you want to work to grab that income. But as income gets so high, you want to enjoy it. In terms of children with more affluence, there is less of a need to work and make money.''</p>
        <p>Neale S. Godfrey, the author of financial books for children, including, with Carolina Edwards, ''Money Doesn't Grow on Trees: A Parent's Guide to Raising Financially Responsible Children'' (Fireside, 1994), said parents were often careless about how they handled money around children.</p>
        <p>''They just see us spending,'' she said. ''We're in a store and we want something, so we use our credit card. There is no accountability, because they don't see the bill being paid. The bill just disappears.''</p>
        <p>SHE says many children expect to live at better socioeconomic levels than their parents did.</p>
        <p>''They think they are entitled to it,'' she said. ''They don't understand what it means to have to work for it. If parents don't start teaching them at home and educators don't teach them in school, they will be ill-equipped to handle the $41 trillion that will be transferred to them over the next 50 years.''</p>
        <p>Alice C. Walsh, 42, of Carmel, N.Y., who raises money for Broadway, Off Broadway and film productions, became concerned four years ago, when her son, James, was about 5. As is typical of children that age, he wanted every toy he saw. ''He was writing letters to Santa in April,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So she started giving James an allowance and made him give part of it to charity and save a portion for college. He also was made to save for his toys.</p>
        <p>''I'll tell you, when he saw that he could have any of those toys he wanted if he bought them himself, it was a really, really great moment,'' she said. ''He now knows to not just ask us.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Godfrey suggested something even more radical.</p>
        <p>To show children exactly where the money goes, parents should cash their paychecks and place the stack of money in front of their children.  They should then put the cash into different stacks, one for each of the household's bills -- utilities, insurance, groceries and so on. There should also be stacks for savings and charitable donations.</p>
        <p>''You have to involve them,'' she said. ''You say, 'Here's the bill; here's the money.' ''</p>
        <p>It sounds unwieldy, but it's worthwhile.</p>
        <p>My wife recently asked me why I always tell the children how much things cost. So they will know, I said. I explained that our son, Antonio, 10, recently told me about a toy he wanted, but when he saw the price tag, he dismissed it. ''It was way too expensive,'' he said, a thought that wouldn't have crossed his mind a year ago.</p>
        <p>And a thought that will, I hope, haunt him for the rest of his life.</p>
