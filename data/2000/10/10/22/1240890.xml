        <p>Wild Men of Borneo, L.I.</p>
        <p>Q.: I understand that, long before my mother first called me by the name, the original ''Wild Man of Borneo'' was exhibited in a New York City sideshow. Was he an actual primitive, and was he, in fact, from Borneo?</p>
        <p>A.: P. T. Barnum is generally credited with conceiving of the first ''wild man'' exhibit in the 1840's, which he presented along with other human oddities at his American Museum, located on lower Broadway across from City Hall Park. Actually, there were two ''Wild Men of Borneo,'' who were costumed in animal skins and encouraged to grunt and scream and otherwise behave in accordance with 19th-century notions of savagery. The wild men were played by Hiram and Barney Davis, twin brothers from Long Island.</p>

        <p>Wild Men of Borneo, L.I.</p>
        <p>Q.: I understand that, long before my mother first called me by the name, the original ''Wild Man of Borneo'' was exhibited in a New York City sideshow. Was he an actual primitive, and was he, in fact, from Borneo?</p>
        <p>A.: P. T. Barnum is generally credited with conceiving of the first ''wild man'' exhibit in the 1840's, which he presented along with other human oddities at his American Museum, located on lower Broadway across from City Hall Park. Actually, there were two ''Wild Men of Borneo,'' who were costumed in animal skins and encouraged to grunt and scream and otherwise behave in accordance with 19th-century notions of savagery. The wild men were played by Hiram and Barney Davis, twin brothers from Long Island.</p>
        <p>A more sophisticated public eventually grew weary of such an obvious canard, but until the 1930's, other wild men, usually said to be from  Borneo, were commonplace in circuses and sideshows. In the early 1900's, a ''bona fide'' Wild Man of Borneo was presented at Dreamland in Coney Island. He was an Alsatian from the Bronx who darkened his face with burnt cork.</p>
        <p>Salt Mine of Harlem</p>
        <p>Q.: As you travel south on the East River Drive near 125th Street, in the shadow of the Triborough Bridge, there is a large pile of what looks like salt, or sand, sitting off to the left. Though it has been in the open air for years, it hasn't flattened out from the rain, or dissolved, like salt. What is it?</p>
        <p>A.: ''Salt,'' said Kathy Dawkins, a spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation, which stores snow-melting salt at 30 sites around the city, in both covered and uncovered areas.</p>
        <p>''Due to humidity and general weather conditions, the salt forms a solid outer crust, which acts as a natural barrier,'' Ms. Dawkins said. ''When it comes time to load the spreaders, we have to use a front end loader to break the shell and get underneath.''</p>
        <p>The city uses 200,000 tons of salt each winter, Ms. Dawkins said.</p>
        <p>The New York Time</p>
        <p>Q.: The meaning seems self-evident, but what are the origins of the phrase ''in a New York minute''?</p>
        <p>A.: The term draws its meaning, of course, from the hectic pace of New York City life and the presumed impatience of New Yorkers. It is generally considered to be Southern in origin as well as spirit; in 1985 the singer Ronnie McDowell cracked the country music Top 40 singing, ''I'd make love to you in a New York minute, and take my Texas time doing it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the term was probably first used in Texas, according to Joan Houston Hall, the chief editor of the Dictionary of American Regional English. Field research by the American Dialect Society, which publishes the dictionary, cites a sheriff in Piney Woods, Tex., saying, ''I'll be ready in a New York minute,'' in 1967.</p>
        <p>''The term first appears in print in the early and mid-1980's,'' said Jeffrey McQuain, the former language researcher for William Safire, who wrote about the New York minute in his On Language column in The New York Times on Oct. 19, 1986.</p>
        <p>''As soon as the column ran, we started getting letters,'' Mr. McQuain said. ''One woman thought the term grew out of the 'York minute,' a term her father had used, before he died in the 1930's. But we were never able to pin this down.''</p>
        <p>Like references to the Big Apple, the term tends to sound discordant and artificial when uttered by anyone who has actually lived or worked in New York City for more than a few minutes. For that reason, perhaps, its use hereabouts is generally confined to the more contrived realms of advertising, promotion and broadcast news.</p>
