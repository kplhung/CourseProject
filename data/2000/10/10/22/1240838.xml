        <p>WOULD you like to have some fun at the expense of some index funds? A couple of opportunities are ahead.</p>
        <p>Both have to do with the 800-pound gorilla of international stock investing, the Europe, Australia and Far East index compiled by Morgan Stanley Capital International. The index, known as EAFE, is tracked by many international index funds; all told, it is the benchmark for perhaps $2 trillion in assets invested in this country. No other international stock index comes close.</p>
        <p>But funds that use EAFE as a benchmark also duplicate its peculiarities. When the  landscape of global investing changes, as it is doing now, nimble investors have a chance to jump ahead of the tide of assets that must shift in order to adapt.</p>
        <p>Opportunity No. 1 exists because the index does not include certain countries that global investors care about. The most prominent is Canada, where stocks have climbed sharply this year.</p>
        <p>Canadian stocks account for about 6 percent of all non-American equities, but because of a longtime attitude that EAFE was the only international index game in town, many investors' portfolios ignored Canada.</p>
        <p>Now, however, other benchmarks are readily available that give Canada its due weight, including another Morgan Stanley Capital International gauge -- the All-Country World index. As investors and fund managers come to rely more on these indexes, they will begin shifting some assets out of other countries and into Canadian stocks, enhancing their relative performance.</p>
        <p>The surge in Canadian stock prices could be substantial. I estimate that if investors who use the EAFE benchmark reallocate assets into Canada in proportion to its share of the world equity market, an extra $120 billion or so will flow in -- equivalent to more than 20 percent of the market capitalization of the companies in Morgan Stanley's Canada index.</p>
        <p>Investors can profit from this shift simply by buying funds that mirror the Canada index. The move should be made soon, because the stellar performance of Canadian stocks this year is likely to accelerate the trend: while the Dow industrials were slipping by 6 percent over the first three quarters of the year, the Toronto Stock Exchange composite was up by more than 23 percent. (Full disclosure: I am a member of the investment committee for a college endowment that has adopted this strategy.)</p>
        <p>OPPORTUNITY No. 2 arises because of a change that Morgan Stanley is likely to make in how it calculates the portfolio weighting of each stock in the EAFE. Investors can beat the index by buying those stocks whose weightings can be expected to grow significantly, and by selling those whose weightings are likely to fall.</p>
        <p>Many investors think index weighting is straightforward arithmetic. In fact, many judgment calls are involved, and in EAFE's case, some of them are now problematic.</p>
        <p>Consider the cross-holdings of two publicly traded companies. If the weight of both companies is a simple function of market capitalization, as is generally the case in EAFE, the index is double-counting these companies' shares to the extent of their cross-holdings.</p>
        <p>In addition, big chunks of some companies are not available to global investors. They may be in government hands -- in recently privatized companies, such holdings may still be huge -- or they may be off limits because of laws limiting foreign ownership. (Such quirks, of course, can cause problems in any cap-weighted index.)</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley has said that it will soon address these issues, by adopting a method that bases each company's weight not on total market capitalization but on its ''free float'' market cap -- a lower number that  excludes cross-holdings, government holdings and shares whose ownership is restricted by law. The gap between those two measures, of course, is larger in some countries than in others. Those with the biggest differences are likely to lose a lot of weight in the index, and funds using it as a benchmark will respond by withdrawing assets from them and reinvesting elsewhere.</p>
        <p>A Salomon Smith Barney study listed Hong Kong and Singapore as those that would be hurt most, and Finland and Britain as those with the most to gain. (A copy of the study is available at www.ssbgei.com.)</p>
