        <p>Some had begun to doubt that it would ever arrive. But here it is at last: the home stretch. The time when pollsters take pulses daily, media consultants are kicking up the advertising buys a notch in swing states, and candidates, surrogates and pundits are coming to terms with the fallout from the debates.</p>
        <p>''I thought he literally was going to hit him,'' Barbara Bush said on the campaign trail last week after the final of the three presidential forums, a town hall meeting in St. Louis. The former first lady was upset by what she concluded was Vice President Al Gore's effort to intimidate her son by crowding him on the stage of Washington University, an act that she said prompted her husband, President Bush, to shout at the television, ''My God!''</p>
        <p>It is that time in the campaign season when nerves start to fray. And this year the tension is particularly high: polls indicate it could be the closest election since 1960.</p>
        <p>Consider the ramifications: the network anchors holding court in studios on the Eastern Seaboard might not call the race until after Californians get home from work and go to the polls.</p>
        <p>What if everyone had to stay up for Hawaii?</p>
        <p>After the debate, Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas resumed their transcontinental quests to win over the undecideds and persuade the ''persuadables,'' those waffling potential voters who are recruited by the news shows to fill the seats in their on-air focus groups.</p>
        <p>Each candidate was taking sharper aim at his rival. The Democrats ran new ads attacking Mr. Bush's environmental and education record in Texas. The Republicans replied with new spots labeling Mr. Gore a spendthrift who will rapidly run through the surplus. With just a bit more than two weeks to go, political analysts say, things are likely to get rougher.</p>
