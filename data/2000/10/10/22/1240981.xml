        <p>Even as stock prices fluctuate, thoughts on Wall Street have turned from the Big Board to the Big Diamond.</p>
        <p>The World Series battle between the Yankees and Mets -- the first Subway Series in 44 years -- has been dominating conversations on the trading floors and elsewhere in New York's financial district.</p>
        <p>''I happened to visit the floor of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, and as I walked by, 60 to 70 percent of the groups of people were talking about the Mets and Yankees,'' Bill Allyn, director of principal trading for Jefferies &amp; Company, said in an interview with Bloomberg last week. ''They're talking about the cost of the tickets and the times of the games.''</p>
        <p>With games expected to run late into the night, ''traders are going to have to get used to operating on a little less sleep,'' added Mr. Allyn, a Chicago native and a White Sox fan.</p>
        <p>Andrew Forman, an analyst at UBS Warburg, could not get baseball out of his mind, as some of its customers learned. In a recent investment report, he jokingly offered theories for last week's downturn in specialty-drug stocks: ''Concern that earnings are slowing, a preference for computer shares, the need to raise money to buy World Series tickets.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Forman likened the Mets to the specialty-drug industry: Both were born in the 1960's and are underdogs taking on old-timers.</p>
