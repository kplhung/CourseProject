        <p>IT'S a World Series museum. It's Yankee Stadium, where, after nearly half a century, another Subway Series opened last night. Too bad nobody thought to put a chunk of an old subway car (no graffiti, please) or maybe an E-ZPass sign out there in the empty area beyond center field. Not for laughs. For atmosphere.</p>
        <p>If there's a Museum of Natural History on Central Park West, then the big gray fortress in the Bronx is baseball's museum of natural history, particularly World Series history.</p>

        <p>IT'S a World Series museum. It's Yankee Stadium, where, after nearly half a century, another Subway Series opened last night. Too bad nobody thought to put a chunk of an old subway car (no graffiti, please) or maybe an E-ZPass sign out there in the empty area beyond center field. Not for laughs. For atmosphere.</p>
        <p>If there's a Museum of Natural History on Central Park West, then the big gray fortress in the Bronx is baseball's museum of natural history, particularly World Series history.</p>
        <p>The Mets were the museum's new exhibit. As the Yankees won 25 of their previous 36 World Series, the Dodgers, the Giants, the Cardinals, the Braves, the Reds, the Cubs, the Pirates, the Phillies and the Padres were on display there in other Octobers; the Cardinals are the only National League team to hold an edge, 9-5, in World Series games at the Stadium. But the Mets would be creating new moments to decorate the museum.</p>
        <p>Look anywhere at Yankee Stadium and you can see the ghosts of World Series moments that are more hallowed than haunting. No ''postseason'' moments, thank you. Just the real thing, the World Series moments when the red-white-and-blue bunting seems to be bigger and brighter. Even if some of those moments went against the Yankees because even they can't win 'em all.</p>
        <p>Look at the mound where Don Larsen pitched a perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956, where Johnny Podres shut out the Yankees, 2-0, in 1955 for the Dodgers' only Series triumph as a Brooklyn franchise, where Joe Page and Mariano Rivera fired fastballs in the ninth inning, and where Grover Cleveland Alexander struck out Tony Lazzeri in 1926.</p>
        <p>The mound where Whitey Ford, Vic Raschi, Allie Reynolds, Eddie Lopat, Lefty Gomez, Red Ruffing, Waite Hoyt and Herb Pennock won years ago, where David Cone, David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens worked in recent years. The mound where the Brooklyn-born Dodger left-hander Sandy Koufax set a Series record with 15 strikeouts in the 1963 opener.</p>
        <p>Look at home plate, where Bill Dickey and Thurman Munson crouched and where Jackie Robinson was ruled safe on a 1955 steal as Yogi Berra objected. Even before anybody finishes asking Yogi about that play now, he growls, ''He was out.''</p>
        <p>Go to the batter's box for right-handed hitters, where Joe DiMaggio swung so majestically. Or to the box for left-handed hitters, where Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig swung back in the 20's and 30's and where Reggie Jackson swung in 1977 when he hit three homers off three pitchers to finish the Dodgers.</p>
        <p>Go to first base, where Gehrig roamed in so many World Series but, sadly, Don Mattingly never did.</p>
        <p>On the way to second base, glance at where DiMaggio, in a rare display of frustration, kicked the dirt in 1947 after Al Gionfriddo, a little-known Dodger outfielder, caught his towering drive against the old 415-foot sign in front of the left-field bullpen.</p>
        <p>At second base, remember how Bobby Richardson, Billy Martin, Jerry Coleman and Joe Gordon turned a double play.</p>
        <p>At shortstop, remember how quickly Phil Rizzuto got the throw away after snatching a ground ball, or how smooth Bucky Dent, Tony Kubek and Frank Crosetti were, and how smooth Derek Jeter is.</p>
        <p>At third base, remember Graig Nettles's whirling dervish plays that stifled the Dodgers in 1978.</p>
        <p>Go to left field, where, Yogi said, ''It gets late early'' in the years when all Series games were played in the afternoon under October's slanting sun. Or where in 1955 Dodger outfielder Sandy Amoros sprinted to the foul line, speared Yogi's drive, and fired to shortstop Pee Wee Reese, whose relay to first baseman Gil Hodges doubled up Gil McDougald.</p>
        <p>Go to center field, where Mr. October's third homer that 1977 night landed in the empty black area. Or where, when the original wall in 1923 was somewhere short of the Bronx County Courthouse, a drive by Casey Stengel himself, then a Giant outfielder, allowed him to hurry home for an inside-the-park homer even though one of his shoes had loosened rounding second.</p>
        <p>Go to right field, where the Babe patrolled, where Mickey Mantle wrecked a knee in 1951 when he somehow stepped in a drain. Glance into the stands where Tino Martinez's grand slam against the Padres in the 1998 opener landed and where Tommy Henrich's walk-off homer off Don Newcombe landed to complete a 1-0 classic in the 1949 opener with the Dodgers.</p>
        <p>Stare at the upper deck in right field, where Mickey's towering homer off Cardinal reliever Barney Schultz landed in 1964.</p>
        <p>Check the bullpen, where Goose Gossage and Sparky Lyle warmed up and where Rivera might be warming up any minute. Peek into the dugout, where Miller Huggins, Joe McCarthy, Bucky Harris, Casey Stengel, Ralph Houk, Billy Martin, Bob Lemon and Joe Torre have cogitated like wise old codgers. Feel free to stare at the principal owner's box on the mezzanine level. He might be there, strutting or scowling.</p>
        <p>It's all there in the World Series museum.</p>
