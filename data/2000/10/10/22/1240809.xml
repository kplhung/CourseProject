        <p>A sundown chill swept off the glimmering Hudson and through the back door of Rockwood &amp; Perry, which under different names has sold liquor and wine since 1934, starting right after Repeal. It was a slow Wednesday evening, a good time for a tasting.</p>
        <p>The store, called Ferrara Brothers in 1936 when it moved across the street to 541 Warburton Avenue, resembles a faded Norman Rockwell setting: neon sign out front, stamped-tin ceiling, old wooden shelves, peeling wallpaper.</p>
        <p>''One day I have to fix the wallpaper,'' Peter N. Rockwood, who bought the place in 1982, said. ''I never get around to it. All the energy seems to go into getting the wine.''</p>
        <p>A practiced eye, surveying the wines displayed in wooden crates, saw quickly that he has eclectic, thought-through tastes. His informative newsletter, near the cash register, confirms that impression.</p>
        <p>Seven guests, regular customers, arrived for a tasting of 11 southern Rhones and settled themselves around a brightly lighted, paper-covered wooden table.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rockwood and his wife, Fran, visited the region in April, his invitation said, to buy the much heralded '98 vintage. ''The wines were magnificent,'' he said. ''Astonishingly,'' he went on, ''the French had kept prices low.'' He found ''excellent-class producers'' who had never exported to America. ''It's your best dream of finding truly undiscovered wine gems.''</p>
        <p>That's a proposition that Ronald S. Pohl, Jeffrey R. Hewitt, Peter C. Hinman, Arthur G. Riolo, Mark I. Shapiro, Lawrence M. Karam and Manuel Suares couldn't refuse. The wines, Mr. Rockwood told these guests, ''arrived in August and are recomposing themselves -- they are showing pretty well.''</p>
        <p>A brie and a Vermont Cheddar and bottles of Evian eased the informal tasting trip led by Mr. Rockwood through the appellations: Cotes du Rhone, Cotes du Rhone Villages, Gigondas and Chateauneuf-du-Pape.</p>
        <p>The silent, periodically contemplative sampling of hefty winter reds, punctuated by tentative opinions, agreements and differences, joking and good-natured one-upping gibes, turned strangers into back-of-the-store cronies from 7:30 to 9 o'clock.</p>
        <p>''No. 6 is drinking beautifully,'' Mr. Suares said of the wine poured from a numbered brown bag and tasted blind. Mr. Riolo observed: ''No. 5 is what I preferred the most as time went on (which under different names has sold liquor and wine since 1934) at first it was unruly.'' Mr. Riolo found that ''No. 7 had concentration, good tannins and a nice finish.''</p>
        <p>The wines are well worth stocking. The following recommended 98's will be offered at sale prices through the holidays:</p>
        <p>Gigondas: Domaine du Parandou ($17), Domaine St. Damien ($19), Domaine des Tourelles ($19).</p>
        <p>Cotes du Rhone: Berard ''Foulaison a l'Ancienne'' ($13), Domaine Berthet-Rayne ($12).</p>
        <p>Cotes du Rhone Villages (Sablet): Domaine du Parandou ($13), Domaine de Piaugier ''Les Briguieres'' ($19).</p>
        <p>Chateauneuf-du-Pape: Mas St.-Louis ($20).</p>
        <p>WINE UNDER $20</p>
