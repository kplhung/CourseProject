        <p>THE stock market is looking for help from the Federal Reserve Board in the form of lower interest rates. But for now, the Fed is looking out the window.</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, the bond market could use some help, too. The booming economy has meant less borrowing by federal, state and local governments. But a lot of companies have had to borrow to stay competitive, and many of them are starting to stumble.</p>
        <p>Moody's Investors Service said last week that corporate credit quality weakened in the last three months. It was the 10th consecutive quarter that Moody's issued more downgrades on bonds than upgrades.</p>
        <p>The Pacific Investment Management Company buys a lot of bonds. But these days, it doesn't much care for corporate paper. William H. Gross, a Pimco managing director, took time last week to explain. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Central banks worldwide have been raising rates. Could that lead to a recession?</p>
        <p>A. -- First, it's not just central banks that have been raising rates. The market has been raising rates on speculative debt and is becoming more discriminating in making loans in the private sector.</p>
        <p>At this point, it's hard to know if we are looking at a recession. Indeed, in a new-age economy, it is hard to know what constitutes a hard landing. It could well mean growth of 1 percent to 2 percent. And I think we will be growing a lot less than 6 percent and a lot closer to zero.</p>
        <p>Q. -- The Bank Credit Analyst said in its June issue that net interest costs for the corporate sector rose by more than 13 percent in the last year. But you are more worried about so-called junk debt than anything else, right?</p>
        <p>A. -- Over the past three months, interest rates on Treasury paper have probably dropped 50 to 75 basis points. [A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.] Rates on high-grade corporate paper have come down too, but maybe by half that amount.</p>
        <p>But rates on high-yield paper are probably 200 basis points higher.</p>
        <p>Q. -- In a speech last week, you told investors to avoid corporate bonds ''at any cost.'' What do you see coming?</p>
        <p>A. -- There are two possible scenarios.</p>
        <p>The first is if we get a slowdown or a recession. If that happens, corporate bonds will not do well, because profits will be threatened and the margin of safety for coverage of interest payments will be reduced. Under those conditions, investors flee to quality bonds.</p>
        <p>The other scenario says we continue to power ahead, with growth of 4 percent to 5 percent. That would be positive for profits and for stocks. But we think it would still be bad for a lot of corporations, who have failed to keep up in the new economy and are suffering.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Isn't the second scenario better?</p>
        <p>A. -- Not if you are a corporate bond holder. They would actually prefer a less dynamic economy, because change threatens corporations.</p>
        <p>If you are a stock investor you can diversify against creative destruction. But a corporate bond portfolio cannot. In that portfolio, you are left with some winners that pay off what was loaned to them previously, and some losers that don't. If we actually got a hard landing, the Fed would lower rates and the economy would respond. That is a cyclical thing. But the new-age scenario is one that continues, because it is a long-range, secular phenomenon.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Which scenario is better for municipals?</p>
        <p>A. -- Municipals do well under both scenarios. An economic slowdown or hard landing will have only a slight impact on high-quality munis like California or New York bonds. And the continued good growth scenario is government-friendly.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Isn't the absolute level of interest rates lower now than it was in the late 1980's, when we had a real credit crunch?</p>
        <p>A. -- Interest rates are lower, but the amount of corporate debt is much higher.</p>
        <p>Corporations have been borrowing heavily for several reasons: first, to keep pace with technology, and to buy other companies they consider will help them remain competitive. But not all that spending will pan out. That is one of the problems the new-age  economy presents: there are so many alternatives. If you take the wrong path, it might be disastrous for both bond and equity holders.</p>
        <p>Q. -- What fixed-income paper do you prefer?</p>
        <p>A. -- Quality has to be the watchword. At Pimco we are sticking to quality through Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through bonds. They yield about 7.5 percent, compared to 5.75 percent for Treasuries of comparable maturity.</p>
        <p>Obviously, 7.5 percent is less than what you could get on lower-rated corporate bonds, which are now in the 9 percent to 10 percent range. But you pick up a fair amount of yield compared to Treasuries.</p>
