        <p>The Hill Bachelors</p>
        <p>By William Trevor.</p>
        <p>245 pp. New York: Viking. $22.95.</p>
        <p>Joyce Carol Oates recently termed the short story a minor art form ''that, in the hands of a very few practitioners, becomes major art,'' and she named Kafka, Mann, Hemingway, Borges and Katherine Mansfield as 20th-century masters. Among living writers, John Updike and Alice Munro make a claim for major status, while across the water William Trevor's name leads all the rest, both in the extent and in the quality of his production. His ''Collected Stories'' (1992) contains 85 of them, and since then have appeared 24 more, 12 in ''After Rain'' (1996) and the remainder -- he seems to like 12 stories to a book -- in ''The Hill Bachelors.'' In a Paris Review interview in 1989, Trevor called the short story ''an art of the glimpse,'' whose ''strength lies in what it leaves out.'' Trevor's art of the glimpse is relatedly an art of nuance, of indirection and implication. No writer less invites reading at high speed; in fact, you often don't begin to find your way around in one of Trevor's stories until you reread it.</p>
        <p>I came to Trevor's fiction through his novels (my preference being for the longer survey rather than the glimpse), first ''The Children of Dynmouth'' (1976) and the masterly ''Other People's Worlds'' (1980); then later on ''Felicia's Journey'' (1994) and ''Death in Summer'' (1998). In one way or another all these novels are about predatory figures from the underside of society who light upon the established and well-to-do, or the innocent, the trusting and the vulnerable. The degree of malignity varies in the villains, and they are never merely villainous, since we are taken into their twisted imaginations in ways that foreclose simple condemnation. But the excitement of these novels is a result of Trevor's wicked skill in giving life to portraits of depravity; it is the corrupted and the maimed, among his characters, who have the most vivid life.</p>
        <p>All stories -- all fiction, you might say -- are about human trouble, instances of which animate and provoke the writer. In Trevor's case, since he was born in Ireland and has lived for decades in England, the larger dimension of unease -- the Troubles -- has played an important role in his writing. In ''The Mourning,'' one of the most affecting stories in ''The Hill Bachelors,'' a nave young Irishman named Liam Pat Brogan is inveigled by political activists into moving to London, where he is provided with lodgings and a job -- his ultimate destiny to be the planter of a bomb in the city, just as he departs home to Ireland. Liam Pat, though not a clever fellow, eventually realizes that his situation mirrors that of an Irish forerunner, another young man who made a mistake in planting his bomb: ''the bits and pieces . . . scraped up from the pavement and the street, skin and bone, part of a wallet 50 yards away.'' In the story's climactic scene, Liam Pat decides, instinctively, not to plant the bomb and throws it into the Thames instead. ''It was his mourning of the boy, as he might have mourned himself,'' and Trevor ends the story with the slightly elevated ''poetic'' insight appropriate to a conclusion not fully concluded, as the young man ''wondered instead about the courage his fear had allowed, and begged that his mourning would not ever cease.''</p>
        <p>A ''positive'' ending of this sort suggests one major way in which Trevor's short fiction may be distinguished from that of his great predecessor, the author of ''Dubliners.'' James Joyce said that those stories were focused on ''paralysis,'' with Dublin at its center, and were written throughout in a style of ''scrupulous meanness.'' Many of Trevor's earlier stories, like ''Miss Smith,'' ''Hotel of the Idle Moon'' or ''The Grass Widows,'' are resourceful at contriving such meanness, in moments of hideous embarrassment and unpleasantness. But increasingly, so it seems to me, and especially in this collection of stories and the previous one, he has grown less interested in creating victims so as to score points off them. His literary art has become exploratory, rather than clinically diagnostic or satiric, and in so doing it has become more generous toward his characters.</p>
        <p>For example, in ''Three People,'' the collection's opening story, we meet Vera Schele, her aging father and a handyman named Sidney, who does house repairs for the Scheles and seems to be the subject of Vera's especial solicitude. Only gradually does the trouble that unites these three people in paralysis become patent: for Vera once had a disabled sister, Mona, who was found dead one day 14 years earlier, presumably killed by a startled intruder. Mr. Schele was then off at work and Vera -- on whom suspicion fell -- at the cinema, so she claimed. It was Sidney, an employee at the cinema, who came forward and provided Vera with an alibi, testifying that he was with her at the time of her sister's murder -- only late in the story is Vera's guilt fully revealed. It is the narrative's complicated and unforthcoming way to hover over the implicated threesome, who will never again be as they were, especially Vera and Sydney. ''The darkness of their secrets lit, the love that came for both of them through their pitying of each other: all that might fill the empty upstairs room, and every corner of the house.'' But this imagining of the two after her father dies is only a conditional ''might,'' since in the story's final, grim sentence, ''Vera knows that, without her father, they would frighten one another.'' Trevor once wrote about the fiction of Ford Madox Ford, ''I remember the novels and their people as one remembers life and I think that is as it should be.'' That sort of remembering, delicate in its unfolding and revealed through a sequence of glimpses, makes up Trevor's art in this disturbing story.</p>
        <p>Yet there is something a shade mechanical, certainly relentless, in the way Trevor releases bits of ''Three People'' so as to create a cumulative trouble about which the narrator can then be gravely eloquent. By contrast, the two best stories in ''The Hill Bachelors'' contain individual energies that are not negated by the exposure and embarrassment of the central character. In ''Against the Odds'' a canny businesswoman, Mabel Kincaid, has departed her native Belfast to stay in an inland town, ''long enough for any bit of trouble to quieten.'' Mrs. Kincaid, who in fact has never married but was once financially duped by a prospective husband, pulls a similar trick on the widower she meets in the inland town, a Mr. Blakely, who is moved to write her a large check as earnest of his marital intentions. Mrs. Kincaid proceeds to fly the coop (we gather she has done this before), banks the check, then is distressed. Against the background of a flare-up of the Troubles (Mr. Blakely's wife died in an earlier manifestation of them), Mrs. Kincaid finds herself touched by a ''benign infection . . . even though her trouble was her own.'' The story ends with her writing a letter to Mr. Blakely, contents undisclosed. There is no exact accounting given of what has happened or will happen, but we feel the woman has been touched -- as has the reader -- by the vitality and warmth of her experience with the man she ditched. That vitality will remain; whatever the letter says, her writing of it is a denial of paralysis.</p>
        <p>But the story that most triumphantly kicks back at paralysis is ''Death of a Professor,'' along with ''Against the Odds'' the two longest in the collection and surpassing it in sharpness of humor and sympathetic range (both stories rank with Trevor's best over all). ''Death of a Professor'' is beautifully and economically told, in five parts, the first of which focuses on a group of unsavory college dons gathered at the Master's noontime sherry party, where they await the arrival of one of their number, Ormston, who has that morning been the victim of a hoax -- a false obituary, appearing in four newspapers. Ormston eventually arrives, unknowing of his reported demise since, as we find out in Part 2, his wife has removed the obituary from their morning paper, blaming the newsboy for his carelessness. In the story's third part, Ormston learns what has occurred, then in Part 4 goes to have a number of solitary drinks at a pub, where -- in a richly inward meditation -- he imagines what such an obituary would have left out: ''his occasional testiness, his cold appraisal of examination answers, the orderly precision that enhances his work and affects him as a husband, the melancholy that comes from nowhere.''</p>
        <p>It would surely not record, he reflects, that ''his wife was younger by 16 years,'' nor that she was ''as lovely in her day as Marilyn Monroe.'' Nor would it say that he had been unable to give her the children she wanted.</p>
        <p>In the final section Ormston returns home to have lunch with his wife and confront what has happened to him, to them. Without giving away the touching and original resolution, I will simply call it as fine a moment as any I know in Trevor's fiction. He praised Ford Madox Ford for the way that writer ''shatters the surface of things and even out of the fragments creates an extra pattern of truth,'' and he singled out ''the honor and decency of which he wrote so movingly.'' Those qualities are ones we find on ample display throughout ''The Hill Bachelors,'' especially in the moving felicities of ''Death of a Professor.''</p>
