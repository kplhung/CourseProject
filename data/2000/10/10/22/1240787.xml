        <p>Back on the Stage With a Mission</p>
        <p>Julia Kelly of Yonkers is an actress whose career was nearly wrecked by obsessive compulsive disorder. ''I didn't want to go down in history as the actress who cracked up,'' said Ms. Kelly, who has since recovered and is back on stage.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Kelly, who has appeared Off Broadway in ''Steel Magnolias'' and in several Fleetwood Stage productions in New Rochelle, has found fertile material in her ordeal. The actress is out to de-stigmatize mental illness by showing its ordinary face.</p>
        <p>Ever feel like screaming in the grocery store? Do you worry about germs in a crowded theater? Ms. Kelly walks the line between everyday anxiety and pathological fear in her one-woman show, ''Don't Mind Me,'' whose topics include hypochondria, self-mutilation, agoraphobia and other personal torments. She refers to them as ''psychological snags and scrapes'' and manages to find their funny side. She feared she would snag the upholstery in people's houses, ruin their floors, break the restaurant glassware and pay the wrong price for groceries. She describes the fear as something ''you can't describe, but it's as real as an intruder in your house.''</p>
        <p>When, after therapy, she began writing about her experiences, people began telling her about their own mental angst.  Audiences laugh, but they cry, too, she said, because so many people suffer silently.  ''I'm strong and grateful now, but this is still in the dark ages,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Westchester Arts Council gave Ms. Kelly a $2,500 Arts Alive grant to develop her show. The Westchester Department of Community Mental Health gave her $2,000 to make a video. Next Friday at 8 p.m., Ms. Kelly will give a free performance of ''Don't Mind Me'' at the Art Council's Arts Exchange at 31 Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains (914-428-4220). Other free performances will take place Nov. 4 at 8 p.m. at the Pelham Arts Center (914-738-2525) and Nov. 5 at 3:30 p.m. at the New Rochelle Public Library (914-632-7878).</p>
        <p>A Play With More Than One Meaning</p>
        <p>''De donde?'' in Spanish means ''Where are you from?''</p>
        <p>But in ''De Donde,'' a play by Mary Gallagher, the words are also used metaphorically. ''Where are you coming from? What is your point of veiw? It's not just a geographical issue,'' said Michael Posnick, director of the department of dance and theater at Manhattanville College. He said the play, which concerns the plight of illegal aliens fleeing poverty and oppression in Latin America, deals with attitudes toward immigrants and borders.</p>
        <p>On another level, he said, ''It asks what a community needs to do to maintain its integrity. These are issues that apply to all of us.''</p>
        <p>Students from 32 countries attend Manhattanville, with Hispanic students representing 14 percent of the full-time undergraduate population of 1400. (The figure comes from U.S. News and World Report, which also listed the college as among the top 15 most diverse schools in the country.)  The college is observing Hispanic Heritage Month by performing the play next Friday and Saturday and Nov. 3 and 4 at 8 p.m., as well as next Sunday and Nov. 5 at 3 p.m. Tickets are $7, $3 for students. Information: (914) 323-7175.</p>
        <p>Putting the Pieces Together</p>
        <p>Winds may howl, battles may rage, but for the puzzle solver, the world can wait. As the last piece falls into place, life seems manageable -- if only for the moment. ''We gain a sense of order from doing puzzles,'' said Mary Lou Alpert, a co-director of the Katonah Museum of Art's new exhibition, ''The Art of the Puzzle: Astounding and Confounding.'' ''There's a feeling of satisfaction. Besides that, it's fun.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition followed naturally from earlier museum shows on board games and construction toys. Puzzle art, which will run through Jan. 7, features 342 jigsaw and mechanical puzzles, divided into categories like ''puzzles as teachers,'' ''puzzles as reflections of society'' and ''puzzles as messengers and persuaders.''</p>
        <p>Map puzzles date from mid-18th-century London and reached the United States in the early 19th century. By 1908, picture puzzles were a craze, becoming a successful manufacturing industry for women. Television  knocked jigsaw puzzles out of the picture for a while, but they rebounded in the form of museum replicas cut into a thousand pieces.</p>
        <p>The Katonah exhibition invites visitors to solve puzzles, and take part in some related activities including a demonstration of puzzle cutting from 1 to 4 p.m. next Sunday; a symposium on the art of the puzzle, moderated by Will Shortz (crossword editor of The New York Times) on Nov. 12 at 9 a.m.; and children's workshops on Nov. 5, Nov. 19 and Dec. 10. Information: (914) 232-9555.</p>
