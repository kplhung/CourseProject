        <p>Losing</p>
        <p>Matt Shepard</p>
        <p>Life and Politics</p>
        <p>in the Aftermath</p>
        <p>of Anti-Gay Murder.</p>
        <p>By Beth Loffreda.</p>

        <p>Wyoming is a long, long way from Christopher Street. The whole state has not one gay bookstore or bar, although it has enough gay residents to exchange this joke: ''How can you find a gay man in Wyoming? Look for the wife and kids!'' In this climate, one evening in 1998, two roofers who had to pay for their beer in dimes and quarters left a bar in Laramie with a 21-year-old gay college student, took him to the edge of town, robbed and pistol-whipped him and left him lashed to a fence. He died five days later.</p>
        <p>The world's response to the murder of Matthew Shepard was quick and horrified. One among the reporters who arrived by the planeload to size up the state announced to the television camera, ''Hate: it's a common word in Wyoming.'' Beth Loffreda was horrified herself, all the more so because she was the faculty adviser to the gay students' organization at the University of Wyoming, where Shepard had just enrolled, but as a recent arrival in the state she recoiled, too, at the assault on her new home.</p>
        <p>Loffreda opens ''Losing Matt Shepard'' by saying, ''Perhaps the first thing to know about Laramie, Wyo., is that it is beautiful.'' She acknowledges the shriveling of opportunity that has left some people living in cars and tents, grasping at menial jobs, demeaned by domestic violence and methamphetamine and, for racial minorities, frozen out by banal humiliations. But she is immensely moved by the moral sense of people who, even if they had viewed homosexuality as a bicoastal disorder, were impelled by the murder to examine their own prejudices.</p>
        <p>The book describes Matthew Shepard -- physically slight, immediately personable, expensively dressed -- and his killers, one malevolent without pause and the other more hapless. But this account is more ethnography than true-crime story, and more interested in the audience than the actors.</p>
        <p>Loffreda, who is straight, seems a bit dazzled by her gay and lesbian subjects, describing them, as individuals in a persecuted group are often described, as wise, thoughtful, sensitive and funny. And despite a self-deprecating allowance for her status as a university type, she shows the campus-activist faith that there is no evil that cannot be cured by a workshop. Yet Loffreda is hardly unsophisticated. She takes quick note of symbolism and ritual, and of the media's power to fashion a reality apart from the occurrence of a murder, a reality that was subject to change, in popular perception as in physics, because it was being watched.</p>
        <p>And the whole world was watching Laramie. As cameras on the courthouse lawn recorded religious oddballs protesting ''homosexual advocacy,'' countered by gay demonstrators dressed as angels, Loffreda writes, ''that stretch of grass seemed like some talk show greenroom, aflutter with promotional materials and scripts, packed with handlers and newsmakers, an antechamber to minor celebrity.'' Major celebrity is more insistent, of course. To demand a forceful local response, Barbra Streisand, for example, phoned the sheriff's office, while Madonna called a university official.</p>
        <p>Loffreda examines the political impulse to answer hate with statutes creating hate crimes. Though her own heart sinks at the Wyoming Legislature's repeated rejection of such legislation, she does not dismiss the state's libertarian sensibility, which doubts that trouble calls for more laws, or the arguments by some gay people that they do not want particular consideration as victims.</p>
        <p>And in recounting the murder, for which both killers are serving life sentences, Loffreda appreciates the difficulty of assigning motives: ''Discriminatory violence is rarely fully plotted . . . it is far more often a bleak and ugly blur of knee-jerk discomfort.'' But to find that prejudice is insidious is only to find that it is common. ''This is perhaps more difficult to legislate or fix,'' Loffreda concludes, ''but it is crucial to see.''</p>
