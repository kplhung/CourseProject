        <p>AMONG the nation's airlines, the top performers in the third quarter were those that did the best at protecting themselves against soaring energy prices.</p>
        <p>According to earnings reports last week, fuel costs rose 64 percent at America West and 75 percent at U S Airways, as both reported losses. Fuel costs at Delta, Southwest and American, a unit of AMR, rose much less, and all three stayed in the black.</p>
        <p>Though earnings at Delta Air Lines, at $273 million, or $2.08 a share, were still off from the third quarter a year earlier, its fuel costs rose just 45 percent. The airline uses about three billion gallons of fuel a year. By hedging, or finding ways to guarantee some of its fuel costs, the company says, it saved $160 million during the quarter, more than any other airline.</p>
        <p>Michele Burns, Delta's chief financial officer and executive vice president, took time last week to discuss how the airline manages its hedging program. The means are somewhat complicated, using call options, which give the airline the right, though not the obligation, to buy heating oil (whose price closely tracks that of jet fuel) at set prices on given dates. The goal is to protect against price increases but still benefit from declines, all without paying huge amounts for this sort of insurance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Burns also gave her outlook on energy prices for the next year. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>JULIE DUNN</p>
        <p>Q. -- What is Delta's approach to hedging its fuel costs?</p>
        <p>A. -- We hedge our fuel with call options on heating oil. We use heating oil because it correlates best to Delta jet fuel. We use it as a financial instrument to hedge jet fuel.</p>
        <p>Depending on where you are, you can pay very different prices for fuel. Basically how we hedge is we use an insurance-based risk management approach. We look at, say, a 10-year period and try to find our average cost, then we try to hedge in and around that band of what our average has been. It's a perpetual program.</p>
        <p>Any time we put down the option, the downside is the premium. But in the last five quarters, for $100 million in premium expenses, we have netted $600 million due to hedging. So we have found that this works well for Delta.</p>
        <p>Q. -- How long has Delta been hedging on fuel?</p>
        <p>A. -- The program has been in place for roughly four or five years, but we are constantly refreshing and updating our approach. Jet fuel is our second-highest expense, behind salaries. Unhedged fuel is 16 percent of our total operating costs. And not only is it a large expense, it is also a very volatile one. Over the last two years, unhedged fuel has fluctuated from 38 cents to $1.01. From a responsible management perspective, anything we can do to manage that volume is important.</p>
        <p>Q. -- At what price is Delta currently hedged?</p>
        <p>A. -- The prices have been in the mid-50's. That is where we are today. Jet fuel costs above $1 per gallon today. We laid on a lot of hedges when prices were at an all-time low -- many of these hedges were laid on in early 1999.</p>
        <p>We like to idle at 50 percent hedged. For the December quarter, we are 60 percent  hedged; for calendar 2001 we are 40 hedged.</p>
        <p>Q. -- What is your outlook? Do you expect fuel prices to rise  even higher?</p>
        <p>A. -- I try very hard not to take a view of the market. Over time, historically, these spikes in heating oil have not been sustained. Today, we are hedged at 40 percent for 2001, but that is not to say we won't change the hedge if the circumstances present themselves. It's a perpetual program. What we do expect is continued volatility.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Why do you think Delta has been successful at hedging fuel?</p>
        <p>A. -- We hedge because we think it's the right thing to do from the perspective of managing a very volatile and large expense. The watchwords in our program are risk management and simplicity. Delta has been very aggressive in this area; we try to stay very much ahead of the curve.</p>
