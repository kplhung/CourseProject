        <p>Paumanok's '98 cabernet franc rates a B-plus for effort and a C-plus for accomplishment. That's pretty good, considering that it is the winery's first stand-alone cabernet franc (with 10 percent cabernet sauvignon providing support in the blend).</p>
        <p>As Ryan Keb Leeman, a winemaker there, said in a letter, the cabernet franc ''breaks new ground'' at Paumanok.</p>
        <p>No less important, this new varietal wine demonstrates that, like at least 10 of its colleagues, Paumanok feels comfortable about the grape's future not only at its home in Aquebogue but implicitly across the North Fork. Paumanok has about 1.5 acres of cabernet franc under vine, and next year plans to add 2.5 more.</p>
        <p>Until Paumanok decided to let its cabernet franc be a solo performer, it had been a subordinate blending partner in other reds.</p>
        <p>Some buyers may perceive the somewhat stern '98 ($18 a bottle at the winery) as light-bodied, others as medium-bodied. When drunk last week, it was earthy, redolent of dark berries both in aroma and flavor, and possessed a smidgen of pleasing vanillan from the barrel. However, the fruit seemed either prematurely dried or in the grip of tannins that were a little unforgiving, lending the wine a rustic air.</p>
        <p>Despite the negatives, I felt a need to keep sniffing and tasting the wine on and off over a 15-hour stretch because Paumanok's effort to impart profundity to it deserved lingering attention. The process reminded me of the value of persisting through a book whose author's style and voice was somewhat troublesome but whose content proved useful.</p>
