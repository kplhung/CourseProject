        <p>Before stepping down on Oct. 1, Joe Lockhart won praise for his straightforward performance as White House press secretary. Over the same period, Allison Janney won praise -- and an Emmy -- for her artful performance as C.J. Cregg, White House press secretary on NBC's ''West Wing.'' Here, the two talk about watching each other work and the differences between their jobs.</p>
        <p>Q: How has viewing each other's performance changed the way you each do your job?</p>
        <p>Lockhart: I don't think it affected the way I did my job. The benefit of the show is that it has helped people see us as real people. It's kind of odd, because you needed fake people in order to do that.</p>

        <p>Before stepping down on Oct. 1, Joe Lockhart won praise for his straightforward performance as White House press secretary. Over the same period, Allison Janney won praise -- and an Emmy -- for her artful performance as C.J. Cregg, White House press secretary on NBC's ''West Wing.'' Here, the two talk about watching each other work and the differences between their jobs.</p>
        <p>Q: How has viewing each other's performance changed the way you each do your job?</p>
        <p>Lockhart: I don't think it affected the way I did my job. The benefit of the show is that it has helped people see us as real people. It's kind of odd, because you needed fake people in order to do that.</p>
        <p>Janney: We make you look good, huh?</p>
        <p>Lockhart: Yeah, that's something I'm never going to forget. In the season premiere I saw a little bit of myself in the absolute look of disdain on C.J.'s face when a dumb question was asked. Maybe you can't learn that; you have to have it naturally. That was a pretty good dirty look. I liked it.</p>
        <p>Janney: I think the show helps humanize politics. It's an opportunity to give the White House a kind of face lift.</p>
        <p>Lockhart: We appreciate the plastic surgery. We need it.</p>
        <p>Q: Is acting an important talent for a press secretary?</p>
        <p>Lockhart: It's funny, because I don't know the first thing about acting.</p>
        <p>Janney: Oh, no, Joe. You didn't do anything in high school or college?</p>
        <p>Lockhart: Nothing. I had never stood up in front of people in my life.</p>
        <p>Janney: It's interesting, because I feel comfortable standing up before people when I've memorized Aaron Sorkin's words. And yet to stand up and talk about something -- even something that I know about -- unscripted is so hard for me.</p>
        <p>Lockhart: Aaron Sorkin writes beautiful words. I get a lot of words from people, but I don't always have 100 percent confidence about everything that's given to me. If you're a close watcher, that's reflected in how I deliver things. Sometimes I'm not certain we know everything we need to know, and I'll be less than definitive.</p>
        <p>Janney: Mike McCurry said he used to be ignorant on purpose, so he didn't have to feel like he was lying. Do you do that, Joe?</p>
        <p>Lockhart: No. This is not a criticism of Mike, but he had the job during the worst of the Monica stuff, but most everything that needed to be known was known by the time I got the job. During that period he said my job is to tell the truth slowly. I think he meant it was his job to make sure he was sure about things. Reporters get to be wrong every day. They do their best on deadline, they write what they think they know; the next day, as the story moves, they move with it. That doesn't work for people who speak for the government. I would rather be in Hollywood, where you can turn to the end of the script and say, hmm, this is how it ends.</p>
        <p>Janney: In Washington last fall, when you let me step out there at that briefing, Helen Thomas actually came up to me afterward and gave me advice as if I really were the press secretary. She was like, your job is to tell the truth to the American people / that is your only job. I was taken aback.</p>
        <p>Lockhart: Well, there's a whole mutual-fascination process going on when the ''West Wing'' people show up. You know, Rob Lowe is in the Roosevelt Room and 40 people find a reason to go take a look. I'm not just talking about just young women, I'm talking about senior staffers, male and female. And it's very cool to walk around and introduce Allison as the person who plays me on TV. That never happened before; that will never happen again.</p>
        <p>Janney: What is going to happen if Bush gets in office? We're not going to get anywhere near the White House.</p>
        <p>Lockhart: Oh, you guys are going to get canceled. And if you don't, they are going to pull your F.C.C. license.</p>
        <p>Janney: We both went through the same thing in our first year on the job: out in public, people recognized us but they didn't know where from. They were like, were you at my cousin's wedding last week?</p>
        <p>Lockhart: I said, tell them you went to the cousin's wedding, and that you danced. That really gets them. They get this soft look and they think, we must have -- and I must have -- been really drunk. He must have been there, because I was drunk and I was dancing!</p>
        <p>Janney: Now, Joe, I have to tell you, people are like: ''Hey C.J.! Hey C.J.!''</p>
        <p>Lockhart: Yeah, what can I say? You've passed me by.</p>
        <p>Janney: But I think that won't be the same anymore because of ''West Wing.'' Everyone is going to know who everyone is in Washington.</p>
        <p>Lockhart: Well, that was already happening to some extent, because of the impact of television on Washington and politics. So I think that ''West Wing'' accelerated that. You're going to get a lot of people now, young people, who want to get back into politics.</p>
        <p>Janney: How do you feel being retired now? You haven't gotten nostalgic yet, have you?</p>
        <p>Lockhart: It's interesting. I watched all of the stuff from Belgrade in a hotel room, with my feet up. And there was a part of me that wanted to be in the middle of it, and there was a part of me that said, glad that this is somebody else's issue. And I can just watch like most people can. It will just take some time.</p>
