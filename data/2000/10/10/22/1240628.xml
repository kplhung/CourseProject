        <p>Alexis Rockman's chosen subject is the natural world, so every so often he and a few of his like-minded artist friends abandon the comforts of modern life for a spell in the wilderness. Last year, they spent two weeks in equatorial South America. There Rockman photographed his friends in various poses and found the inspiration for the paintings in his current show, ''Expedition,'' at the Gorney Bravin &amp; Lee gallery in New York. The painting above, ''Big Game,'' is part of that exhibition, which runs through Nov. 11.</p>
        <p>Rockman (center): ''If you're dealing with a cycle of tropical paintings, you have to have a hunting image. So the idea is that there are pockets of these giant ground sloths that haven't been discovered -- like what would happen to this animal if it did in fact exist? It would become probably either a photographic trophy or a real trophy. Obviously we've killed this animal, but it was more eco-tourism as a sort of trophy, a collecting of experiences. It was a real act of generosity for my friends to consent to do this. It's a pretty unflattering image.''</p>

        <p>Mark Dion (far left): ''Not a single one of us is a hunter. So you can see the kind of fantasy that goes into these things. My discomfort with Alexis's paintings is that he has portrayed us as these ugly American yahoos. I can't say that I don't feel a little compromised by the exhibition. But at the same time, I have confidence in Alexis, and I also have confidence in the audience that they will able to read these as sort of parodies.''</p>
        <p>Bob Braine (second from left): ''It's really funny to see myself in a painting. I built the camp along with the guide -- I think that's why he had me with the machete. Guys use it in South America like we use butter knives. I think Alexis is making a comment on his personal relationship to ideas of wilderness and jungle, but I'm not 100 percent sure. He's also going after the safari hunter.''</p>
        <p>Peter Cole (far right, in back): ''I really had no idea what to expect. I only had my own fantasies about what the jungle could be like. I'd always envisioned jungle creepers, being able to run through the jungle and a multitude of animals. Well, the reality was quite incredible. I found off in the underbrush a pair of Tommy Hilfiger shorts that had grass growing through and out of them.''</p>
