        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am astounded by the selfish attitudes of the car owners you describe. Could not the man visiting friends on Eighth Street have taken a bus or train? Heaven forbid a pedestrian cross paths with the woman running red lights to claim far-off parking spaces. I've seen the resentful stares of drivers as they wait for people to cross streets before they can complete left turns to continue errands that could probably have been accomplished on public transportation.</p>

        <p>I applaud any effort to reduce the large number of unnecessary vehicles on the streets of New York, but I am afraid that the only way to change such behavior is to affect the pocketbooks of these lazy, self-centered drivers.</p>
