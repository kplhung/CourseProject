        <p>Como Without a Car</p>
        <p>Q. I plan to travel to Italy next year and would like to visit the lake district. Most guidebooks imply that one must drive to appreciate all the sights. I am unable to drive. Is it possible to stay in one place and tour the area using boat, bus and taxi? -- William C. Lynch, San Diego</p>
        <p>A. Since the main points of interest in the lake district border the lakes, and traffic can be a problem on the narrow, winding roads, traveling by ferry is a good way to explore the region. The three largest lakes -- Maggiore, Como and Garda -- are easily accessible and offer the best transportation and accommodations. You can take the train from Milan to each of the three; Como is about a half hour's ride. The best plan would be to stay in one town at each lake to allow time to explore.</p>

        <p>Como Without a Car</p>
        <p>Q. I plan to travel to Italy next year and would like to visit the lake district. Most guidebooks imply that one must drive to appreciate all the sights. I am unable to drive. Is it possible to stay in one place and tour the area using boat, bus and taxi? -- William C. Lynch, San Diego</p>
        <p>A. Since the main points of interest in the lake district border the lakes, and traffic can be a problem on the narrow, winding roads, traveling by ferry is a good way to explore the region. The three largest lakes -- Maggiore, Como and Garda -- are easily accessible and offer the best transportation and accommodations. You can take the train from Milan to each of the three; Como is about a half hour's ride. The best plan would be to stay in one town at each lake to allow time to explore.</p>
        <p>Como would make an excellent base for ferry trips on Lake Como. The area around Como, on the western shore, is the most developed part of the lake, with elegant gardens and classical villas nearby. Navigazione Lago di Como, based in Como at Piazza Cavour, operates a steamer, motorboats and hydrofoils that go to the principal lakeside towns. You can pick up schedules and tourist passes from the ticket office, (39-031) 304060; general ferry information, (39-031) 579211. You can also visit Lake Como's towns by bus; information: (39-031) 247247. For train schedules from Milan, call (39-1478) 88088.</p>
        <p>For information on Lake Como and its lakeside towns, in addition to bus, train and ferry schedules, contact or drop by the Como Tourist Office at Piazza Cavour 17, (39-031) 269712, fax (39-031) 261152; www .lakecomo.com.</p>
        <p>On Lake Maggiore, the medieval town of Stresa would make a fine base, with its villas and gardens and also frequent ferries to the Borromean Islands just opposite the town's lakefront promenade. Here, again, the best way to see the lakeside towns is by ferry, although there are buses and trains to some towns as well. The tourist office is at Via Canonica 3, (39-0323) 30150, fax (39-0323) 32561; www.lagomaggiore.it. For ferry information, call Navigazione Lago Maggiore at (800) 551801 or (39-0322) 46651.</p>
        <p>For a base on Lake Garda, the medieval town of Sirmione is famous for the Rocca Scaligera, an impressive 13th-century castle surrounded by a moat, and the Grotte di Catullo, ruins of a vast Roman villa. The tourist office can be found at Viale Marconi 8, (39-030) 916114; fax (39-030) 916222. For ferry information, call Navigazione Lago di Garda; (39-030) 9149511.</p>
        <p>Around Antalya</p>
        <p>Q. My husband and I will be in Antalya, Turkey, in July. Can you suggest worthwhile day trips and tour companies that can arrange them? -- B. B. N., Demarest, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. Antalya is an excellent base for exploring nearby ancient sites along the Mediterranean. The city itself, set between the sea and the mountains, has a mild climate, Ottoman houses in the old city, ramparts and the Antalya museum -- with magnificent statues, reliefs and sarcophagi unearthed at Perga, as well as Phrygian jewelry and Roman mosaics -- an important stop for those visiting the area.</p>
        <p>The sites of Termessus, Perga and Aspendos are within easy distance of the city. The ruins of the ancient city of Termessus are set among olive trees and pines high on a plateau about 21 miles from Antalya. It is said that Termessus resisted Alexander the Great in 334 B.C. but the city's fortunes declined, and it was abandoned in the fifth century. A monumental Hadrian's Gate, tombs and temples still stand.</p>
        <p>Less than 15 miles from Antalya is the ancient site of Perga, a fine example of a Roman city in Asia Minor.  Outside the city walls stand the well-preserved ruins of a Greco-Roman stadium large enough for 15,000 spectators and the remains of an impressive theater; inside are two towers of a Hellenistic gate.</p>
        <p>Aspendos, in a rural setting 30 miles from Antalya, has an even larger Roman theater, built in the second century A.D. and seating  20,000. Other remains include a Roman aqueduct, Roman baths, a stadium and a nymphaeum.</p>
        <p>Key Tours International, based in Virginia, offers a number of day trips from Antalya. One includes Perga and Aspendos, along with Side, a popular resort that also has a Roman theater, triumphal arch, temples and a museum laid out within the remains of Roman baths. The tour -- offered Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday -- leaves Antalya at 9 a.m. and returns at 5 p.m.; it costs $60 with lunch. Key Tours also offers a private half-day tour of Termessus for $95. Tours require a minimum of two people. Contact Key Tours International at 11096-B Lee Highway, Suite 104, Fairfax, Va. 22030; (800) 576-1784, fax (703) 591-3553; www.keytours.com.</p>
        <p>Another tour company offering a number of day trips is Ezop Travel, (90-212) 292 81 70 or 71, fax (90-212) 292 81 72, www.ezoptravel.com, based in Istanbul. Ezop offers a daily West Antalya tour, which includes a visit to ancient Phaselis, where there is a Roman aqueduct, baths and a theater among pine trees; the ruins of the Lycian city of Olympos; Chimaera; Demre (Kale); and Myra, with its Lycian tombs carved in a rock cliff. Cost depends on the number of visitors taking the tour: $75 for 9 to 16, and up to $192 for one person; lunch included.</p>
        <p>Chesapeake Cruises</p>
        <p>Q. Are there cruises -- extending for several days and nights -- taking one to various locations around the Chesapeake Bay? -- G. W. Heath, Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>A. The 100-passenger Nantucket Clipper offers an eight-day cruise that spends a full five days in the bay each spring before sailing to New York. A naturalist and a historian offer informal talks as the ship passes by marshlands and mudflats, inhabited by ospreys, ibises, herons and egrets, and five historic towns along its shores. Spring generally means mild weather, and gardens are in full bloom.</p>
        <p>Next year, the Nantucket Clipper's cruise begins in Alexandria, Va., on April 28 and stops at Norfolk (with an optional excursion to Colonial Williamsburg), Yorktown, St. Michael's and Annapolis, before sailing to New York, where passengers debark.  Prices range from $1,980 to $3,680 a person, based on double occupancy. Shore excursions are additional.</p>
        <p>Contact the Clipper Cruise Line at 7711 Bonhomme Avenue, St. Louis, Mo. 63105; (800) 325-0010 or (314) 727-2929; fax (314) 727-6576; www .clippercruise.com. Reservations should be made well in advance.</p>
