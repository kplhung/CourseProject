        <p>ONE of the more important documents used by a co-op is the agreement shareholders sign before beginning major repairs or alterations.</p>
        <p>And while some co-op boards have customized agreements that are tailored to the needs of their buildings, most use what is know as the Blumberg form -- a mass-produced, preprinted agreement published by BlumbergExcelsior, a company that provides a variety of boiler-plate forms and agreements for lawyers.</p>
        <p>Recently, however, the Residential Management Council of the Real Estate Board of New York, with the help of the New York City Bar Association, developed a standardized, comprehensive alteration agreement that its creators say covers issues not addressed by the Blumberg form and clarifies others that are.</p>
        <p>''Over the past couple of years management firms have been inundated with shareholders wanting to do major renovations in their apartments,'' said Ronni Lynn Arougheti, chairwoman of the Residential Management Council and president of Heron Ltd., a Manhattan property management company. ''And it seemed that every time someone was ready to start an alteration, there would be some kind of controversy. Many residents really didn't understand the alteration approval process, so we figured it was time to come up with something that would standardize the procedure.''</p>
        <p>The main objective of the new form, Ms. Arougheti said, was to make sure that shareholders renovate in a way that ensures the safety and comfort of the residents, the financial interests of the co-op and the physical integrity of the building. ''The bottom line was to make things as straightforward as possible,'' she said. ''The co-op board has to have clear control over jobs going on at any given time.''</p>
        <p>For example, she said, whenever a shareholder is contemplating a major renovation or alteration, the board needs to know when the work is going to start, how long it is going to take, what building systems may be involved, whether lead-paint remediation regulations are being followed and whether there is sufficient liability insurance.</p>
        <p>To accomplish that, Ms. Arougheti said, the alteration agreement requires a shareholder to submit to the co-op board a set of plans and specifications, including a room-by-room list of all proposed alterations. Those plans may not be modified by the shareholder without the written consent of the board.</p>
        <p>The agreement allows the board to require that the plans be drawn by a licensed architect or professional engineer and requires the shareholder to specify the starting and ending dates. It also allows the board to recover any expenses incurred by the co-op, such as the cost of having the co-op's engineer review the plans.</p>
        <p>''Different buildings may want to handle this in different ways,'' Ms. Arougheti said.  ''But with renovations getting larger and larger in scope, it makes sense to have the resident pay for the building's expert to review the plans.''</p>
        <p>Another important element, Ms. Arougheti said, specifies the shareholder's obligation to comply with local, state and federal environmental rules and regulations.</p>
        <p>''Dealing with things like lead-based paint is critical,'' she said, explaining that the agreement articulates the shareholder's responsibility to ensure that contractors comply with the appropriate practices for removing or disturbing lead-based paint. It specifically requires that the shareholder not use certain methods of removal: burning off old paint with an open flame, power sanding or sandblasting (unless a special vacuum is used to contain dust), and dry-scraping to remove paint from areas larger than one square foot.</p>
        <p>Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the new alteration agreement is more comprehensive than the form now used by many co-ops and their lawyers.  For example, he said, the new form clearly articulates the shareholder's obligation to get prior approval from government agencies for certain work.</p>
        <p>The agreement also expands the list of those who must be named as ''additional insureds'' on the mandatory liability insurance policy the contractor must take out when performing major renovations.</p>
        <p>''Previously, it was just the co-op itself that was named as an additional insured,'' he said, adding that the new agreement requires that the directors, officers, shareholders and experts hired by the co-op must also be named.</p>
        <p>Another important provision, Mr. Shmulewitz said, specifies that only union laborers can be used in buildings under union contract. ''The absence of such a clause has caused problems in the past,'' he said, referring to disputes that develop when nonunion workers are hired by a shareholder's contractor in such buildings.</p>
        <p>Other points covered in the real estate board agreement, Mr. Shmulewitz said, include a provision that makes shareholders responsible for leaks or damage that alterations to terraces or patios may cause in the future, and one that requires shareholders to remove alterations or improvements to give the co-op access to pipes and ventilation shafts that run inside the walls.</p>
        <p>It is not uncommon, he said, for shareholders to install expensive built-in cabinetry in their family rooms or cover the walls of their bathrooms with tile or marble.</p>
        <p>''Under the new agreement, the shareholder can be forced to rip out the improvement if the co-op has to get access to pipes inside the walls,'' he said. ''Under the language in some of the forms being used, the co-op could very well be obligated to pay for removing and restoring the improvement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shmulewitz said that another provision requires new shareholders who buy an improved apartment to assume all the obligations and responsibilities of the shareholder who originally made the improvement.</p>
        <p>''This is a very powerful provision,'' he said, explaining that without it a new owner could potentially avoid responsibility for future damages caused by improvements or could hold the co-op liable for disturbing improvements in order to gain access to pipes inside walls.</p>
        <p>Dennis Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the assumption provision is so important that he would advise a board to provide all prospective buyers with a blank copy of the alteration agreement.</p>
        <p>''That accomplishes two things,'' Mr. Greenstein said. ''It provides a buyer with notice that he or she will be responsible for improvements made by a prior owner, and it puts all prospective purchasers on notice that they will need approval from the board to do alterations.''</p>
        <p>Finally, he said, co-op boards considering the new form should examine both the form and the co-op's proprietary lease to determine whether there are any conflicts.</p>
        <p>''The last thing you want to do is ask shareholders sign a document that conflicts with the proprietary lease,'' he said.</p>
