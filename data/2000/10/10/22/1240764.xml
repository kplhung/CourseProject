        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Design is taught as the manipulation of visual forms with a specific purpose in mind; it is a calculated means to an end. To what end? To create an identity, convey a message, induce a desired emotional response. The best design takes the shortest route to accomplish all that it sets out to do with clarity. Any veiled ambiguity is usually found in the reading of the message, not in the medium itself.</p>

        <p>Design is taught as the manipulation of visual forms with a specific purpose in mind; it is a calculated means to an end. To what end? To create an identity, convey a message, induce a desired emotional response. The best design takes the shortest route to accomplish all that it sets out to do with clarity. Any veiled ambiguity is usually found in the reading of the message, not in the medium itself.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Muschamp to say that consumers are in denial about social problems because their heads are buried by the ''authority'' of the new (commercial) design is like laying the blame of the French Revolution squarely at the feet of the bakers. Somehow I doubt that a society's collective conscience is either starved or fed so significantly by the prominent purveyors of its latest wares.</p>
