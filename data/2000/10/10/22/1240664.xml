        <p>WHEN we walked through the door of the house just outside Paris, all we could do was grin and congratulate ourselves on how smart we were. It was our first vacation home exchange, and the house in which my family would be spending the next two weeks was opulent, with high ceilings, elaborate moldings and stately rooms where we couldn't help but feel royal.</p>
        <p>Our French hosts, in return, received our rather dull four-bedroom Connecticut home where I'm sure they felt mundanely suburban.</p>
        <p>Such are the vagaries of swapping homes, but considering that it helps avoid one of the biggest vacation expenses, hotel bills, and, in some cases, rental car charges, too, it can be worth the risks.</p>
        <p>Vacation home exchanges have grown into a big business, with dozens of organizations willing to help you match your home, mundane or not, with those of people in other parts of the world. I have swapped twice, in France and England, and had two very different experiences. Wait until I tell you about the fleas.</p>
        <p>''The huge advantage to exchanging is that you're not living out of a hotel room,'' said Bill Barbour, co-author of ''Home Exchange Vacationing: Your Guide to Free Accommodations'' (Rutledge Hill Press, 1996). ''You have a kitchen, someone's library, neighbors who are in and out helping. The first thing you know, your kids have new kids to play with.''</p>
        <p>I used word of mouth the first time I swapped, but listed our home on one of the many Web sites for our London trip in August. While I used Trading Homes International, there are several other big ones, including HomeLink International and Intervac. For a fee that can range from $30 to $100, an agency will list your home in a book or on the Internet.  Most services let you include a photograph of your home. You then correspond, usually by e-mail, with the families you find or who find you.</p>
        <p>Paula Keller and her husband, William, of Manhattan, use HomeLink and have exchanged homes four times in the last two years. They have gone to London; Paris; Santa Fe, N.M.; and Mansfield, Conn.</p>
        <p>''The fun is in the looking,'' she said. ''I get two or three offers a week. Being in Manhattan, we get a lot.''</p>
        <p>Location is indeed important. Ron McGranahan of Vero Beach, Fla., has exchanged four times: England, Scotland and twice in France. However, if travelers are attending an event, such as a wedding, even people in the most obscure towns can usually find a match.</p>
        <p>Thanks, but No Commute</p>
        <p>I had thought that being only an hour from Manhattan by train was a plus, but what is an easy commute to me is an unattractive trip for exhausted tourists. If Manhattan is on their mind, why swap with me if Ms. Keller's place is available? In the year I had my house listed at Trading Homes, only one family, the Londoners, responded, but that was enough. They actually wanted to see Connecticut; for them, New York was a bonus. The Paris family happened to have friends in my town.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest problems with exchanging is coordinating schedules. You and the other family may love each other's house, but if your vacation is in June and the other's is in August, it's not going to work. Mr. Barbour said you must be adaptable.</p>
        <p>''If you can't be flexible in time,'' he said, ''you have to be flexible in other areas, such as location.''</p>
        <p>He said many people swap with their second homes, which are often vacation homes. This avoids scheduling conflicts. It gives you the opportunity to let that couple, say, in Italy use your place this fall, while you use theirs next summer.</p>
        <p>While location and scheduling can be hurdles, the biggest is deciding to exchange in the first place. Do you really want strangers in your house, maybe peeking into your underwear drawer? I was also uncomfortable with the Londoners' request to exchange cars. It turns out that it is done all the time. My insurer told me that as long as they had my permission to drive the car, they were covered. You should ask if you are likewise covered by their policy. For home insurance, in most cases your policy covers them and theirs covers you, Mr. Barbour said. But check with your home and car insurers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Keller said she was nervous about her first swap.</p>
        <p>''The first time I exchanged I brought my jewelry and valuable silver to my office,'' she said. ''I soon learned that you didn't have to do that. It was silly. Nobody is going to steal your stuff.''</p>
        <p>Just a Little Mishap</p>
        <p>But that's not to say that things can't go wrong. When the McGranahans swapped both houses and cars with a French couple, the couple's car was stolen after Mr. McGranahan had parked it and run into a wine store. When he called the couple to give them the bad news, they laughed it off and told Mr. McGranahan the car would probably turn up soon. It did, undamaged, a couple of weeks later.</p>
        <p>He also arrived at one home and was greeted by a big dog. The other couple had never told him they owned a dog, let alone that they expected him to care for it. Instead, Mr. McGranahan found a neighbor who would.</p>
        <p>For my part, my children did some damage to the London house, a comfortable town house in a suburb of the city. My daughter, Marian, 13, ruined their electric teapot by putting it on a gas burner; it melted. So I bought them a new one. My son, Antonio, 10, broke a stool, but it looked as if it could be fixed. I left the couple a note offering to pay for the stool and apologizing for the teapot. I also told them about the fleas.</p>
        <p>They had two cats who spent most of the day outdoors. A few days into our visit, Antonio woke up covered with flea bites. Once we started looking, you could see the fleas hopping in the carpet. It was gross. Fortunately, they were mainly confined to the one room, and we moved Antonio out pronto.</p>
        <p>Then we got home. Everything looked fine, but soon we started discovering little problems, then bigger ones. The cold water faucet in one of the bathrooms was broken. So was the floppy disk drive in the computer. When we went to use the car, there was hardly any oil left in the engine.</p>
        <p>We just chalked it up, figuring we had saved several thousand dollars over the course of our two-week stay. We weren't going to sweat a $100 plumber's bill.</p>
        <p>''You have to have trust,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''You have to trust the people you are exchanging with. You have to believe that they are taking care of your place like you're taking care of their place.''</p>
        <p>How can you be sure?</p>
        <p>''It's like being a hostage,'' he said. ''You're in my home, but I'm in your home, too.''</p>
