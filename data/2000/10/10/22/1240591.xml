        <p>PARIS TO</p>
        <p>THE MOON</p>
        <p>By Adam Gopnik.</p>
        <p>338 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In 1957, the French critic Roland Barthes published a book, ''Mythologies,'' that remains essential reading for anyone trying to understand modern France. In a series of extremely short essays, some no more than 500 words, Barthes seized on neglected, even trivial aspects of French life and drew out of them magisterial analyses of his society. He wrote on, among other subjects, steak and fries (''fries are the alimentary sign of Frenchness''), the Citron DS, the soap powder Omo and the Blue Guides. Barthes's genius was to bring the eye of a journalist for the contemporary together with the analytical power of a sociologist and to write in the clear, aphoristic prose style of great French writers like Chamfort or Stendhal. Since 1957, there have been many books on the territory of ''Mythologies,'' but almost all have suffered from impenetrable jargon or annoyingly breezy journalese.</p>
        <p>But now, in this reviewer's mind at least, Roland Barthes has a worthy successor in the shape of Adam Gopnik, essayist for The New Yorker and its correspondent in Paris from 1995 to 2000. ''Paris to the Moon'' is a collection of essays originally written for the magazine that have been seamlessly integrated with new and often more personal material. There are profound and hilarious reflections here on French cafes, cooking, strikes, fax machines, Christmas trees, plugs, toys, football and hospitals -- and much else. The result is the finest book on France of recent years.</p>
        <p>In the opening chapter, Gopnik accounts for what drew him to France, and more specifically Paris, in the first place. ''I've wanted to live in Paris since I was 8,'' he declares, but in the nature of many love affairs with other countries, the reasons for Gopnik's passion remain vague and, he would be the first to admit, rather sentimental. As a child growing up in Philadelphia, he'd seen charming images of Paris in a book adaptation of the film ''The Red Balloon,'' by Albert Lamorisse. As a teenager he'd gone on a trip to Paris with his family and had the best meal he could remember in a simple restaurant near his hotel. A few years later, he'd been back to Paris with his girlfriend (and now wife), Martha, and had felt like an adult for the first time. And, living in Manhattan, he'd felt drawn to the idea of providing his son with a French childhood -- Babar, puppet shows in the Luxembourg gardens, etc. -- in contrast to what he felt was the depressing Gameboy culture predominant in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Gopnik family hadn't exactly chosen the best moment to move to France, as Gopnik concedes; living in France ''was a hard romance to sustain in most of the last five years, when almost everybody else thought that Paris was going straight to hell.'' It has indeed been fashionable (until very recently) to write France off as a country wrecked by obsolete working practices and unable to adjust to the new economics (what the French call, usually with utter disdain, ''the Anglo-Saxon model''). In the last five years, French politics have been rocked by a succession of scandals, there have been almost monthly strikes, the unemployment rate has stuck firmly above 12 percent, French filmmakers and writers don't seem to produce anything decent and, what is perhaps worst of all, it's now often said that you can eat better and cheaper in London.</p>
        <p>But this feeling of being in the right place at the wrong time did not deter Gopnik, who threw himself into the task of describing and interpreting his beloved country. He excuses the absence in his book of some of the more typical journalistic assignments: high politics, local corruption, crime. What really interested him about France was how people ate, where they bought their washing machines, where they went on holiday and so on -- the details of everyday bourgeois life.</p>
        <p>The distinctive brilliance of Gopnik's essays lies in his ability to pick up a subject one would never have imagined it possible to think deeply about and then cover it in thoughts, making connections with literature, sociology and philosophy -- all treated in a highly readable way. ''It is as if all American appliances dreamed of being cars while all French appliances dreamed of being telephones,'' he writes, trying to account for why his refrigerator in Manhattan looks so different from the one in Paris. He argues that the French are obsessed by telephones because they love to communicate, and then goes on to point out that the way they use their phones is very distinctive and quite un-American. They favor a clipped, epigrammatic style of phone conversation, as opposed to the flabby, endless digressions of Americans. Then follow some reflections on the French and their plugs. Gopnik makes much of the fact that the French have ''light, dapper, rounded three-prong plugs with two little cylindrical probes,'' while the Americans usually leave their plugs ungrounded, a symptom of an un-nannying approach by the American authorities, but also of a very un-French tolerance of risk.</p>
        <p>Some of Gopnik's finest pieces relate to eating. In an essay entitled ''A Tale of Two Cafes,'' he tackles head-on one of the great mysteries of life on the Left Bank of Paris: why it is that in the Place St.-Germain there are two cafes, almost identical in atmosphere and food, one of which is deemed the epitome of chic (Cafe de Flore), the other of which (Les Deux Magots) is derided by anyone in the know and is abandoned to the lowest of the low in the natives' eyes, American tourists. Gopnik's analysis of this mystery takes in most of the major figures and events in the history of modern France. He mentions the Vichy government, relations between Camus and Sartre, semiology, Voltaire and Michel Foucault. He is truly able to see the whole world in a grain of sand.</p>
        <p>Another virtue of this book, and what makes it peculiarly French despite the nationality of the author, is the way it is written. Gopnik writes essays in the French rather than the Anglo-Saxon style, by which I mean that he fuses a personal voice (we get to know and like him in the course of the book) with an essentially serious intellectual project. It is this mixture of the personal and the intellectual that places him in the tradition of nonfiction writing that starts with Montaigne and includes the essays of Baudelaire, Camus and of course Barthes himself.</p>
        <p>''Paris to the Moon'' is purportedly about France, but by the end we feel we have learned about more than just one country, we've learned -- through the prism of France -- about differences among societies, and so too about our own particularities.</p>
        <p>Alain de Botton's new book is ''The Consolations of Philosophy.'' He is also the author of ''How Proust Can Change Your Life'' and ''On Love.''</p>
