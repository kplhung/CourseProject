        <p>CORPORATE mergers breed real estate opportunities. Such an opportunity recently attracted two development companies that over the years have been both rivals and neighbors to become partners as well.</p>
        <p>The Rockefeller Group Development Corporation of Manhattan and Gale &amp; Wentworth, a real estate services and investment company of Florham Park, emerged earlier this month as the successful bidders for the former Exxon campus -- Exxon Mobil since last year -- along Route 24 and Park Avenue in this Morris County borough. The two-building 473-acre complex, which once housed Exxon's engineering division, was declared surplus when Mobil and Exxon merged last Nov. 30. So was Exxon's international headquarters site, a 47-acre four-building complex a half mile away, which is now being sold.</p>
        <p>Most of the 1,000 employees at the larger site were relocated to Fairfax Va. Empty, it became one of the last prime commercially zoned parcels of any size left to develop in Florham Park, which like Morris County as a whole, has been the focus of considerable office construction in the past few years.</p>
        <p>Each of the development partners has an office park flanking the Exxon site, on which they have joined forces to create a $400 million office park with 2.2 million square feet of space and such amenities as a day-care center, health club and hotel conference center. It will be built in the next five to seven years, with construction expected to start as early as next year, according to the partners.</p>
        <p>Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners of Manhattan is developing the master plan for the project, which will be presented to the borough's planning board in the next 90 days. The Hillier Group of Princeton is the architect. A new interchange along Route 24 is also envisioned as part of the plan and would address existing traffic in the area -- a major community concern.</p>
        <p>''A lot of work still needs to be done, but we're looking at the site's redevelopment as a positive,'' John N. Corica, the borough administrator for Florham Park, said, noting that if the interchange ''can be done, it would solve many regional traffic issues.''</p>
        <p>The partners will close on the site after they secure local approvals. In addition, the interchange is subject to approval from the state. No one involved would disclose the price for the property, but real estate executives put it about $66 million.</p>
        <p>While the project is seen as a natural extension of the partners' existing parks, it also reflects the continued evolution of the Route 24 office market. The artery, a 12-mile stretch completed about eight years ago, linked eastern Morris County to Newark International Airport via Interstate 78 in 15 minutes instead of 30 and spurred development around major crossroads.</p>
        <p>To the north of the former Exxon parcel is Park Avenue at Morris County, the 100-acre 1.1 million-square-foot corporate center that Gale &amp; Wentworth developed for the J. P. Morgan Investment Management Company in Manhattan, the park's owner. The park, which real estate executives say initiated the area's change to an office corridor, is fully leased. Gale &amp; Wentworth is also developing two other projects in the county, with different investment partners, ultimately totaling one million square feet.</p>
        <p>To the south is the Rockefeller Group Corporate Park, a 142-acre campus being developed by the Rockefeller Group, which is owned by Mitsubishi Estate and which formerly managed the landmarked Rockefeller Center for the Rockefeller family interests. The company still owns or manages four buildings on the west side of Avenue of the Americas that it considers part of Rockefeller Center. But its historic buildings on the east side of the Avenue have been owned since 1996 by an investment group led by Goldman Sachs, which is now selling them.</p>
        <p>The Rockefeller Group in recent years has refocused on its role as a real estate developer. At its Rockefeller Group Corporate Park, the company has renovated two buildings, totaling 390,000 square feet, and is constructing a 220,000 square foot speculative building on the property, which could accommodate an additional structure the same size. In Mount Olive, farther west in the county, the group is developing the International Trade Center, where half of an eventual seven million square feet of office and industrial space has been built since construction at the 684-acre site began in 1984.</p>
        <p>INITIALLY, the Rockefeller Group and Gale &amp; Wentworth pursued the Exxon tract separately. But Leslie E. Smith Jr., senior vice president at the Rockefeller Group, said, ''We're better off as a team, given we surround the property and the enormity of the project.'' Combining the expertise and financial resources of the companies reduces the risk to each one, he said, noting that ''we are both long-term players.''</p>
        <p>Stanley C. Gale, chairman of Gale &amp; Wentworth, said the partnership also provided the seller with ''a comfort level and the assurance of our gaining all the approvals needed to proceed.'' In addition, ''we have the staying power, to sustain and maintain the project,'' if the real-estate market were to experience a slump, he said.</p>
        <p>Barry Wood, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, which has its headquarters in Dallas, said the ability to get approvals was a factor in his company's evaluation of potential buyers, as were the price and the development proposed for the site.</p>
        <p>The joint venture is not a surprise in light of the location of the site and the similar corporate cultures of the companies, said Peter Blanchard, a principal at the Garibaldi Group, a brokerage in Chatham that is handling the sale of the smaller Exxon property. ''Each didn't want to lose the site,'' he said. ''There's a threshold to how high the bids could go before its redevelopment was no longer economical.''</p>
        <p>Joining forces also enables each to capitalize on the county's strong office market, where projects totaling 2.25 million square feet are in various stages of development. Most of the projects are in Parsippany as well as towns along Route 24, according to the Parsippany office of GVA Williams, the commercial brokerage.</p>
        <p>The partners are confident that their new project will not compete with those projects nor their existing ones, and commercial brokers agreed. The pace of construction ''is cautious, yet aggressive,'' Eric Witmondt, chief executive of GVA Williams, said, noting the buildings will be brought to the market at varying times.</p>
        <p>Among the Route 24 projects is a 135,000-square-foot building that the Kushner Companies of Florham Park is constructing at the corner of Columbia Turnpike and Vreeland Road in Florham Park. Also, the Wm. Blanchard Company of Springfield is building a 150,000-square-foot speculative structure on Park Avenue at Columbia Turnpike and Route 24 in Hanover. Brokers said the building had been leased, a report company principals would not confirm.</p>
        <p>Other developers have plans to start buildings. East of the Blanchard site on Route 24 in Florham Park, the M. Alfieri Company of Metropark is to start construction next spring on the initial phase of a 750,000-square-foot office park. The four buildings at the smaller Exxon Mobil site, the sale of which is believed to be imminent, are also expected to be renovated, according to brokers. The buyer is said to be the Advance Group of Bedminster. The company declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Most of the buildings are leased before they are completed, Mr. Witmondt said, noting that as of the third quarter, the county's office vacancy rate was 7.7 percent and average rents had risen to $25.13 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''Many companies from New York and Bergen County are moving west to Morris County, and those here are expanding, keeping the demand, particularly for large blocks of space, ahead of the supply, '' he said. And users prefer a full-service campus environment because in a tight labor market it is seen as a way to attract and retain employees, he added.</p>
        <p>That is what both Mr. Smith of the Rockefeller Group and Mr. Gale of Gale &amp; Wentworth are betting on for the office park they will build on the former Exxon property. Mr. Gale said that if existing companies in the 165 million square foot northern and central New Jersey office market grew by 10 percent, this would generate a need for 16 million square feet. ''And the state's core industries -- telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and financial services -- are growing, never mind outside companies moving in,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith added that three companies needing 500,000 square feet each were interested in the site, and the developers hope to begin construction next year on up to 500,000 square feet, subject to borough approval. The intent, he said, is either to retrofit the site's two existing buildings, totaling 500,000 square feet, or raze them and build an equal amount of space, which could be supported by the existing road system.</p>
