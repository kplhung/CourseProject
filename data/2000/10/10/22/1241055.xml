        <p>Hackensack continued its unbeaten season yesterday by defeating Nutley, 49-6, behind an impressive performance from the senior running back Kaliym Hazel, who rushed 26 times for 147 yards and 5 touchdowns. He also had a 70-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.</p>
        <p>Hackensack (7-0) is regarded as the top team in the state. Besides Hazel, the team has a dangerous passing attack led by the senior quarterback Bryson Rosser and the senior wide receiver Bryan Wilson, as well as a stingy defense that features defensive tackles Karon Singleton and Marlin Towne, and linebackers Cedric Brown and Chris Duncan, who had three sacks against Nutley (1-5). Bloomfield (5-1 after a 13-0 victory over Clifton on Friday) will play at Hackensack next Saturday.</p>

        <p>Hackensack continued its unbeaten season yesterday by defeating Nutley, 49-6, behind an impressive performance from the senior running back Kaliym Hazel, who rushed 26 times for 147 yards and 5 touchdowns. He also had a 70-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.</p>
        <p>Hackensack (7-0) is regarded as the top team in the state. Besides Hazel, the team has a dangerous passing attack led by the senior quarterback Bryson Rosser and the senior wide receiver Bryan Wilson, as well as a stingy defense that features defensive tackles Karon Singleton and Marlin Towne, and linebackers Cedric Brown and Chris Duncan, who had three sacks against Nutley (1-5). Bloomfield (5-1 after a 13-0 victory over Clifton on Friday) will play at Hackensack next Saturday.</p>
        <p>Delbarton (7-0) came from behind to defeat Wayne Valley (4-2), 20-9, and maintain its place among the top teams in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Wayne Valley's defense had shut down Delbarton's running game, and Delbarton found itself trailing early in the fourth quarter, 9-7. Facing a third-and-long on its own 5-yard line, Delbarton gave the ball to the senior tailback Geoff Close, who took the handoff 83 yards downfield to the Wayne Valley 12-yard line, setting up his own go-ahead touchdown.</p>
        <p>Delbarton was helped on both sides of the ball by the fullback and linebacker Joe Albarelli, who had 5 carries for 36 yards, 2 catches for 45 yards and a touchdown, and 12 tackles and a sack on defense.</p>
        <p>St. Joe's Montvale (5-1) took advantage of Paterson East Side's turnovers in a 28-12 victory. St. Joe's picked off two passes and recovered three fumbles. Two were recovered by the junior defensive end Leo Dugan. On offense, the junior running back Jon McPhee ran for 101 yards and a touchdown.</p>
        <p>The senior running back Rickey Cook led Montclair to a 27-14 victory over Paramus Catholic with 190 yards rushing and 4 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>LONG ISLAND</p>
        <p>Linebackers Chris Bretton and Mike Schaffer led BETHPAGE (6-0) as its defense registered a 34-0 shutout of LYNBROOK (1-5). Bretton and Schaffer combined for 14 tackles and 3 sacks. Bretton also played fullback, carrying the ball 11 times for 58 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>COMMACK (6-0) remained the only undefeated team in Division I with a 36-13 victory over CONNETQUOT. The senior quarterback Mike Prahalis completed 11 of 23 passes for 326 yards and 5 touchdowns. Prahalis hooked up with his favorite target, the senior wide receiver Bryan Tornee, 8 times for 187 yards and 3 touchdowns. Tornee and Prahalis switched places, with Prahalis catching a pass from his longtime teammate for a gain of 17 yards.</p>
        <p>BALDWIN (3-3) defeated EAST MEADOW (3-3), 14-7, thanks to a one-man defensive stand by the senior linebacker Matt Berg. With East Meadow facing a third-and-1 to keep a drive going with less than two minutes left in the game, Berg made two consecutive tackles for losses to preserve Baldwin's victory.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK CITY</p>
        <p>MIDWOOD (2-5) kept things close for almost three quarters, but LINCOLN's (7-0) offense proved to be too much as it held on for a 28-14 victory. Midwood took advantage of Lincoln's mistakes, using a fumbled snap and a blocked punt to score all its points. With the score tied, 14-14, and 20 seconds remaining in the third quarter, quarterback Mike Pierre threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to the senior wideout Dexter Alexander, and Lincoln held off Midwood's upset bid.</p>
        <p>HOLY TRINITY (4-3) had a huge game on the ground in its 48-22 victory over FORDHAM PREP (5-2), rushing for more than 500 yards. The senior Bernard Plaia had 25 carries for 234 yards and 3 touchdowns, and the junior Jerrell Jenkins carried the ball 14 times for 222 yards and 4 touchdowns to account for all of Holy Trinity's points. Fordham Prep's Richard Schwam, a junior running back, carried the ball 18 times for 169 yards and a touchdown.</p>
        <p>PREPS</p>
        <p>POLY PREP (7-0) has lost only one of its last 34 games, and it had little trouble stretching its latest winning streak to 10 games with a 40-27 victory over VALLEY FORGE of Pennsylvania (5-1). Poly Prep was led by the senior Marcus Wilson, who carried 30 times for 347 yards and 4 touchdowns, and he chipped in on defense with 12 tackles and an interception.</p>
        <p>RIVERDALE (4-2) received 111 yards and 2 touchdowns from the senior tailback Danny Skelly in its 18-14 victory over CHESHIRE ACADEMY of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The senior Darrell Swann did a little bit of everything in HACKLEY's 35-0 drubbing of ST. PETER'S. Swann had 9 carries for 71 yards, 2 catches for 50 yards and a touchdown, and an interception that he ran back for 55 yards to set up a score.</p>
