        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Just a quick reality check for Kate Hudson [''A Confidence Drawn From a Charmed Life'' by Dana Kennedy, Oct. 8]. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of actresses as talented as she is. I'm an acting teacher, and I see talent all of the time. However, it doesn't matter how talented you are if you can't be seen, if you can't get through the door that is wide open for Ms. Hudson because of whom she is related to. I don't begrudge her that; I am happy for all actors who are able to work at what they love to do. I am a bit put off, however, by her easy dismissal of the advantages she does have. She appears to lack the grace to acknowledge how incredibly fortunate she is.</p>
