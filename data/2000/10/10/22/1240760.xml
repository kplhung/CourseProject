        <p>NO matter how much white shrink-wrap you swaddle it in, there's just no way to hide an F-14 Tomcat fighter plane.

        <p>NO matter how much white shrink-wrap you swaddle it in, there's just no way to hide an F-14 Tomcat fighter plane. So heads swiveled and eyes widened in August when a big tow truck and flatbed trailer rumbled up Route 105 carrying an object that, despite its covering, showed enough of the Tomcat's distinctively raked wings to erase any possibility that the trailer was hauling another mobile home.</p>
        <p>The plane being rolled down the road had left Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach on the final leg of a strange pilgrimage. Destination: The front lawn of an old assembly plant, where routes 25 and 25A converge. The Tomcat, sparkling in the morning sun like a prodigal warrior, was coming home to the place where it was built.</p>
        <p>At an unveiling ceremony on Saturday, the plane will formally become the centerpiece of a privately sponsored plan to create a park to honor the legions of workers who manufactured the F-14 and other notable warplanes for Grumman, the giant of Long Island's vanished aerospace industry.</p>
        <p>A cluster of former Grumman employees breathed a collective sigh of relief as the F-14 was carefully lifted by crane onto three concrete pylons that will hold the plane 20 feet off the ground, as if ready to fly above the Calverton National Cemetery across Route 25.</p>
        <p>Passing motorists stared, but it was hard to tell how many recognized the plane as a Long Island heirloom. Despite its local roots and its success in decades of service as the hottest plane in the United States Navy, the F-14 is probably best known, even here, for its role as Tom Cruise's co-star in the movie, ''Top Gun.''</p>
        <p>Most relieved of all when the F-14 was finally in place were Steve Kirschenbaum, who proposed the monument as head of the not-for-profit East End Aircraft Corporation; Ken Euring of Mattituck, an Air Force veteran who got his start as a Grumman crew chief; and board directors Joe Van de Wetering, John Caruso, Jim Petrocelli and Bobby Goodale.</p>
        <p>Not all of the museum activists are former Grummanites. Some just felt close to the company that produced the F-14. Mr. Kirschenbaum, for example, grew up in a home that was virtually on the runway of the Calverton airport.</p>
        <p>''You have to understand,'' said Raymond Kirchdorfer, 82, of Ridge, who was one of many men who returned from military service in World War II to find the welcome sign out at the Calverton plant. ''Grumman was not just a place to work. We became like family. Even now, several hundred of us meet to celebrate a couple of times a year.'' The most recent gathering was on Wednesday at the Crest Hollow Country Club in Woodbury.</p>
        <p>From a standing start in 1930, working originally from a garage in Baldwin, Grumman made a name for itself with the FF-1, at introduction the fastest fighter plane in the world, then produced the famed Wildcat and Hellcat carrier-based fighters that gained control of the skies in the Pacific during World War II. Its biggest postwar achievements were the F-14, the A-6 bomber and the lunar module that ferried six American crews to the moon.</p>
        <p>At its peak in World War II there were more than 25,000 workers -- roughly the population of Poughkeepsie -- at Grumman's plant in Bethpage, and thousands more worked at the Calverton plant, which opened after the war. Virtually every family on Long Island had a relative on the Grumman payroll or knew someone who worked for the company.</p>
        <p>Production of the F-14 ended in 1992 when then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney persuaded President George Bush to drop the Tomcat from his budget. More than 5,000 Grumman employees were put out of work. Two years later the company was bought by California-based Northrop, and its Long Island operations shriveled. But the Navy still has about 120 Tomcats in its inventory.</p>
        <p>''This is a way of saying thanks to all the Grumman retirees and to remind them of what a wonderful company they worked for, the best in the nation,'' said Mr. Van de Wetering, 64.</p>
        <p>Much of the early spadework for the monument was done by Suffolk-based former employees such as Mr. Euring, 46, who worked for Grumman after high school and before becoming a crew chief with the Air Force.</p>
        <p>Mr. Euring's biggest concern? Getting the F-14 ready to travel the circuitous, obstacle-avoiding route that took it between Westhampton and Calverton. (The runway here is closed, and the town is pursuing a variety of non-aviation uses for the site.)</p>
        <p>''We moved the wings back as far as we could,'' he said. ''We made the nose higher, the tail lower. Low branches had to be removed. We cleared power lines by two inches, maybe less. And the police had to close off large sections of roads along the way.''</p>
        <p>The F-14 on display, the 331st of 712 assembled at Calverton, was delivered to the Navy in September 1979 and assigned to Squadron VF-84 at Oceana, Va. Its last flight was a year ago, and it had been sitting in its shrink-wrap at Gabreski Airport before its final journey to Calverton.</p>
        <p>The shrink-wrap is scheduled to come off and be replaced with camouflage netting a day or two before Saturday's unveiling ceremony, scheduled for 11 a.m. (The rain date is Sunday.) Visitors to the unveiling will also find a Walk of Honor surrounding the monument along with park benches donated by Grumman retiree organizations.</p>
        <p>Memorial bricks for the walk, at $75 each, are designed to include a 42-character inscription and a short narrative describing the individual's contribution to the company. A computer in a rebuilt guard shack so familiar to Grummanites will direct the visitor to the donated brick.</p>
        <p>''If each invited brick donor brings any guests there could be as many as 5,000 people here,'' Mr. Van de Wetering said half-seriously. ''Where would we put them? How would we feed them?''</p>
        <p>The Riverhead Town Board voted unanimously a year ago to donate 10 acres at the 2,900-acre Calverton site, now owned by the town, for the monument project. It includes no hangar space, but if he can get it Mr. Kirschenbaum hopes to add much memorabilia, including other Grumman-built planes, to the collection in coming years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Euring has his eye on an F-14D, the most advanced variant of the Tomcat, that's now part of the collection of the Intrepid museum on Manhattan's West Side. ''If we could get some hangar space out here, I'd like to take that plane away from the Intrepid,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Cradle of Aviation Museum, scheduled to open at Mitchel Field in Garden City in the fall of 2001, also has an F-14 and several other Grumman aircraft in its collection, but as for competition for planes between the Calverton organization and the Cradle of Aviation or anyone else, Mr. Euring said there is none. ''They're packed,'' he said of the Mitchel Field museum.</p>
