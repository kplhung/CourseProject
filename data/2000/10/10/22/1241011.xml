        <p>Following is an excerpt from ''Earth in the Balance,'' Vice President Al Gore's environmental manifesto, which bolsters its arguments with frequent references to spirituality.</p>
        <p>The idea of social justice is inextricably linked in the Scriptures with ecology. In passage after passage, environmental degradation and social injustice go hand in hand. Indeed, the first instance of ''pollution'' in the Bible occurs when Cain slays Abel and his blood falls on the ground, rendering it fallow. According to Genesis, after the murder, when Cain asks, ''Am I my brother's keeper?'' the Lord replies, ''Your brother's blood calls out to me from the ground. What have you done?'' God then tells Cain that his brother's blood has defiled the ground and that as a result, ''no longer will it yield crops for you, even if you toil on it forever!''</p>

        <p>In today's world, the links between social injustice and environmental degradation can be seen everywhere: the placement of toxic waste dumps in poor neighborhoods, the devastation of indigenous peoples and the extinction of their cultures when the rain forests are destroyed, disproportionate levels of lead and toxic air pollution in inner-city ghettos, the corruption of many government officials by people who seek to profit from the unsustainable exploitation of resources.</p>
