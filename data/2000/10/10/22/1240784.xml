        <p>FOR good reason, a song called ''Westchester Dreamin' '' is included on the latest album by Bob Baldwin, a contemporary jazz keyboardist and composer.</p>
        <p>Born in Mount Vernon, Mr. Baldwin was raised in Yonkers and Peekskill, graduating from Walter Panas High School in 1978. And although he moved to Atlanta several years ago, his parents still live here in the county.</p>
        <p>''There are so many things I love about Westchester,'' Mr. Baldwin said recently. ''All the different towns, the Hudson River, the beautiful landscapes -- I've been inspired to write songs just by driving down the Taconic Parkway.''</p>
        <p>On Nov. 4 Mr. Baldwin returns to Peekskill to perform at the Paramount Center for the Arts; the proceeds of the concert will benefit the theater, which the musician often visited in his youth.</p>
        <p>After graduating from college, Mr. Baldwin spent a few years in radio broadcasting, all the while honing his art. A big break came in 1989 when he received a Sony Innovator Award, presented to him by Roberta Flack, and since then he has recorded several albums and worked as an arranger and producer for many other artists.</p>
        <p>His new album, ''BobBaldwin.com,'' which is riding high on the charts, features a guest appearance from Chuck Loeb, the guitarist and Irvington resident.</p>
        <p>Bob Baldwin and Friends will appear at the Paramount Center for the Arts, 1008 Brown Street, Peekskill, on Nov. 4 at 8 p.m. Tickets: $10 to $19.50. Information: (914) 739-2333.</p>
