        <p>For travelers, the addition of 511,000 seats, bringing the total to nearly 5.7 million, means a slightly better chance of being able to redeem frequent flier miles for tickets to the four islands served from the mainland: Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai.

        <p>Domestic airlines are increasing the number of seats from the mainland to Hawaii by nearly 10 percent this year as they add new departure cities, increase the frequency of some flights and switch to larger planes.</p>
        <p>For travelers, the addition of 511,000 seats, bringing the total to nearly 5.7 million, means a slightly better chance of being able to redeem frequent flier miles for tickets to the four islands served from the mainland: Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. American, United and Delta all report that Hawaii is the destination most sought by people with frequent flier miles.</p>
        <p>The new gateways include nonstops to Honolulu from Dallas and San Jose, Calif., on American; from Detroit on Northwest; from Oakland, Calif., on Aloha; and, starting in January, from San Diego on Hawaiian. T.W.A. is offering flights from St. Louis to both the Big Island and to Kauai. United is upgrading its weekend flights from San Francisco to Kauai to daily service and will soon replace the DC-10's on that run with larger Boeing 777's, said Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman.</p>
        <p>Continental offers the only nonstops from the New York area with an 8:15 a.m. daily departure from Newark on a DC-10.</p>
        <p>Tony Vericella, president of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, said the added seats are part of a drive by officials there to increase tourism, especially during the periods between the high season and low: April through early June and mid-September to mid-December.</p>
