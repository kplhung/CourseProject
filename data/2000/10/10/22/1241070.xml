        <p>Dissatisfied with the way his club had been playing, Devils Coach Larry Robinson made several moves tonight that lighted a fire under the defending Stanley Cup champions. With Chris Terreri making his first start in goal and with three centermen joining new line combinations, the Devils trounced the Tampa Bay Lightning,7-2, at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>The Devils ended a two-game slump without a victory and improved their record to 3-2-1 against a team that had scored five goals in each of its previous two games.</p>
        <p>Terreri made his first appearance of the season two nights ago in Washington, when Robinson pulled Brodeur after he had allowed 4 goals on 10 shots in less than 34 minutes. In that 5-2 loss, Terreri allowed the last goal of the game when a shot from 60 feet hit his glove and then popped into the net.</p>
        <p>''Our team played so solid,'' said Terreri, who faced 3 Lightning shots in each of the first two periods and 15 in the whole game. ''We never game them a chance.''</p>
        <p>Robinson put Terreri through a rigorous competition with Frederic Henry in training camp. Terreri won the job with a couple of effective appearances in preseason games.</p>
        <p>Terreri made seven good saves in the third, when the Devils experienced a natural letdown after scoring seven goals in the first two periods. Fredrik Modin and Pavel Kubina tallied for the Lightning in the last period.</p>
        <p>The only line combination Robinson left intact was John Madden at center with  Jim McKenzie on the left and Turner Stevenson on right wing. Robinson built an all-Czech line by putting Bobby Holik between left wing Patrik Elias and right wing Petr Sykora.</p>
        <p>He also established a Russian line with Sergei Nemchinov centering for left wing Sergei Brylin and right wing Alexander Mogilny. The other line was Scott Gomez centering left wing Steve Kelly and right wing Randy McKay.</p>
        <p>Holik assisted on the first two goals, which both came on the power play.</p>
        <p>The first pass came from the left side to Sykora, who one-timed it for his second goal of the season, 10 minutes 17 seconds into the game.</p>
        <p>Holik's other assist came from the right side, this time to an open McKay, who beat Lightning goaltender Dan Cloutier from close range with 2:37 left in the first period. It was McKay's third goal of the season.</p>
        <p>The Devils broke the game open with five goals in the second period, including two goals 40 seconds apart by Nemchinov and Ken Sutton. Nemchinov's goal, off assists from Mogilny and Scott Stevens, came at 8:19. Sutton, with assists from Elias and Colin White, scored at 8:59.</p>
        <p>Brian Rafalski, McKenzie and Brylin scored the other goals in the session against the hapless Cloutier.</p>
        <p>It was two clever passes by Mogilny that set up Nemchinov's third of the season and Rafalski's second. The goal by Sutton was his first in two seasons, McKenzie's goal was his first of the season and Brylin's goal ended the rout with 39 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Kevin Weekes replaced the battered Cloutier, who allowed the seven goals on 36 shots, to start the thrid. Weekes faced eight shots and allowed no goals.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The Devils played SASCHA GOC for the second consecutive game on defense, scratching WILLIE MITCHELL for the second game in a row. . . . JAY PANDOLFO sat out his third straight game with a bruised left shoulder he suffered a week ago and ED WARD has yet to make an appearance. . . .  The Devils will play their next three games on the road, starting at Florida on Wednesday, visiting Carolina on Friday and culminating the trip with a game at Pittsburgh next Saturday night. . . . The Devils announced they would stage their annual food drive on Nov. 11, when they play host to Buffalo at Continental Arena. Fans are asked to bring unopened cans or nonperishable food.</p>
