The award is one of four the county has received for improved government services through the use of technology. The Community Help Desk also recently received a Certificate of Recognition for ''innovative government solutions'' from the Eastern Regional Government Technology Conference Advisory Board in Albany. Earlier in the year, the county received an achievement award for its Geographic Information Systems from the Environmental Systems Research Institute in Redlands, Calif. The help desk stores knowledge from professionals who deal with at-risk youths and the elderly.</p>
