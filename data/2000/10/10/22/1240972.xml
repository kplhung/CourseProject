        <p>Joe Kelly of Dads and Daughters is doing some much needed work in our country.

This demonstrates without a doubt the power of media and the impact it has on kids. I think we are only beginning to understand the importance of fathers in kids' lives.</p>

        <p>In so many ways, an active father helps build a healthier society one step at a time, one child at a time -- as we see with the work of Mr. Kelly.</p>
