        <p>What a noodge! She made me shlep to the theater for tickets to a schmaltzy play. While I waited, this nudnik kept kibitzing. I don't mean to kvetch, but his schmoozing was annoying. His shtick made me so meshuga, I walked away. But I tripped. Sometimes, I can be a klutz.</p>
        <p>THE funny thing is that, however inelegant that paragraph may be, you probably understood it. If you are a New Yorker, you may even have thought that every word was standard English. That's pretty solid evidence of how a fair amount of Yiddish, the language of European Jews, has become mainstream in America, land of the free and home of the bagel.</p>

        <p>What a noodge! She made me shlep to the theater for tickets to a schmaltzy play. While I waited, this nudnik kept kibitzing. I don't mean to kvetch, but his schmoozing was annoying. His shtick made me so meshuga, I walked away. But I tripped. Sometimes, I can be a klutz.</p>
        <p>THE funny thing is that, however inelegant that paragraph may be, you probably understood it. If you are a New Yorker, you may even have thought that every word was standard English. That's pretty solid evidence of how a fair amount of Yiddish, the language of European Jews, has become mainstream in America, land of the free and home of the bagel.</p>
        <p>Here is another sign. Few eyebrows were raised when Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, rivals for a New York Senate seat and without a Jewish bone in their bodies, both tossed out ''chutzpah'' in a recent debate. They took for granted that a national television audience would know they meant gall.</p>
        <p>Ah, but there is a pitfall that can leave the unwary messed up -- farpotshket, if you will. The Yiddish that Americans tend to know (most Jews included) consists of only a word here, a word there, and often those words are exceedingly vulgar. Yet clueless speakers casually toss them out all the time, and now and then they land in hot water.</p>
        <p>Former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York learned his lesson during his 1998 re-election campaign when he tried to be a shtarker, a big shot, before a Jewish audience. He dismissed his opponent, Charles E. Schumer, with a Yiddish word commonly used by New Yorkers to call someone a jerk. Most of them have no idea that the word means penis and is so coarse that it won't be printed here. No doubt Mr. D'Amato lost the election for many reasons. But he didn't help himself by behaving like a shmo (a cleaned-up version of another popular Yiddish word for jerk that also mean penis).</p>
        <p>''People can get into trouble when they think they know more than they do -- what's surprising?'' said Samuel Norich, publisher of The Forward, a venerable Yiddish newspaper in New York that also has English and Russian editions.</p>
        <p>Call it, with apologies to the late lexicographer Leo Rosten, the Oys of Yiddish.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, lawyers in a Boston case called the other side's court papers ''dreck.'' They thought they were simply saying ''junk.'' But in Yiddish, dreck means excrement. The judge, not amused, gave them a klop in kop. If you prefer, he read them the riot act.</p>
        <p>Americans in places where the Jewish influence has been great often refer blithely to the rear end as the tochis, having no inkling that this word, too, is vulgar. They will say something is worth bubkes -- nothing -- unaware that the word derives from Yiddish for goat droppings. They will call a crotchety old man an alter kocker, blind to the fact that it means old defecator. (And that is a sanitized translation; just try saying it in front of your bubbe.)</p>
        <p>On the flip side, some innocent words have come to assume sexual meaning. Shtup means to push or to press, but it has also become a way to say fornicate.</p>
        <p>Why do such problems arise?</p>
        <p>Partly it is because Yiddish in the post-Holocaust era is hardly a thriving language, despite enjoying a small revival on college campuses and remaining the mama-loshen, or mother tongue, of many Hasidic Jews. In the absence of natural growth, the language fell into the hands of Hollywood and the Borscht Belt -- treated far too often, Mr. Norich says, as just ''a bunch of curse words.''</p>
        <p>Lost in the popular culture is memory of Yiddish as the language of ''a vast body of literature,'' says Aaron Lansky, president of the National Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Mass. A similar lament comes from Ruth R. Wisse, a Harvard professor of Yiddish and comparative literature. ''Unfortunately,'' she says, ''what people associate Yiddish with is kitsch and poverty and a part of the Jewish culture that ultimately doesn't have to be taken seriously.''</p>
        <p>She has a point. Sometimes, all it takes to get a laugh is to put a Yiddish ''sh'' in front of a word. That shushing sound has ''formidable phonetic power,'' Mr. Rosten once observed in his best fancy-shmancy language.</p>
        <p>Not everyone bemoans Yiddish's joke potential. Rabbi Moshe Waldoks of Brookline, Mass., who co-edited ''The Big Book of Jewish Humor,'' admires Yiddish's ''earthy realism'' and calls it the perfect light vehicle to ''deflate pomposity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lansky understands that sentiment, even if he feels that Yiddish doesn't get the respect it deserves. ''Look, I don't want to get too heavy-handed,'' he says. ''You want to make a joke? Gezintahayt.'' Go in health.</p>
