        <p>GARDENERS who are fond of peering into the past already know that human history is littered with gourds. Ancient people used the hard shell Lagenaria (Calabash) varieties as utensils and containers. Early Egyptians sealed them in tombs along with other earthly necessities they thought that the deceased would need in the afterlife. Native Americans grew and used hard shell gourds and passed the habit along to the colonists.</p>

Centuries from now, when archaeologists unearth the remnants of 21st century North American civilization, they will find lots of metal and extruded plastic, but very few gourds.

        <p>GARDENERS who are fond of peering into the past already know that human history is littered with gourds. Ancient people used the hard shell Lagenaria (Calabash) varieties as utensils and containers. Early Egyptians sealed them in tombs along with other earthly necessities they thought that the deceased would need in the afterlife. Native Americans grew and used hard shell gourds and passed the habit along to the colonists.</p>
        <p>But things have changed. Centuries from now, when archaeologists unearth the remnants of 21st century North American civilization, they will find lots of metal and extruded plastic, but very few gourds. In fact, probably the only way they will find gourds is if they chance to uncover a garden center that was suddenly encased in amber on a Saturday in October.</p>
        <p>Gourds, whether they are small and warty or large with long crooked necks, are part of the Cucurbitaceae family. You encounter their relatives every time you snack on dill pickles, gorge on summer cantaloupe or attempt to make your child eat squash.  At Halloween, you might even carve up and illuminate another Cucurbit, the pumpkin.</p>
        <p>If you like gourds for fall arrangements or craft projects, there is only one thing to do right now -- go down to the garden center and buy a dozen or so. Next spring, however, try growing your own. Major seed companies sell seed mixtures that produce either small or large varieties. The smaller gourds come in an array of shapes and all the same colors that you find in the garden center: shades of yellow, orange, green and white, with some striped and bi-colored varieties thrown in for good measure. Mixtures of large gourd varieties include the Calabash (bottle) types that are popular with crafters.</p>
        <p>Serious gourd fanciers can also obtain seeds for individual varieties.  One vendor offers seeds for the provocatively named Caveman's Club/ Maranka type (Lagenaria siceraria). This Club is dark green with a narrow handle-like projection. The catalog copy claims that it can be used ''to enliven fall displays and for personal protection.'' It may be wise to check with your local authorities before carrying a concealed gourd on your person for such a purpose.</p>
        <p>Pacifists may prefer the Speckled Swan, another Lagenaria siceraria variety, which resembles a dark green speckled swan with a downward curving neck. Both the Caveman's Club and the Speckled Swan are late-maturing varieties and should be planted early in areas with short growing season.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has grown a zucchini or a pumpkin can grow ornamental gourds. Groups of seeds can be planted in hills or individual seeds can be sown in rows directly in the garden.  Because gourd vines tend to spread all over the place, many gardeners tie the vines to trellises. If you decide to grow your gourds vertically, be sure they are firmly attached to the support structure, as they are quite heavy when loaded with fruit.</p>
        <p>There are lots of things you can do with ornamental gourds. The smaller ones look lovely as is, piled up in a brass bowl. For most craft applications though, the fruits should be dried before use. To do this, pick unblemished gourds and wash them with a solution of 1 part chlorine bleach to 10 parts water. This removes soil, sterilizes the surface of the fruit, and helps prevent decay.  Gourds with necks or handles can be pierced with a threaded heavy-duty sewing needle and hung in a shaded, well-ventilated spot to dry out the insides. Other types, such as the apple, egg and turban-shaped varieties, can be placed on slatted trays or hung up in ventilated bags. Just be sure that individual gourds do not touch each other. Drying times vary according to the size and type of gourd, but count on at least five weeks.</p>
        <p>Once the gourds are dry, you can shellac or paint them, then hot glue them onto wreathes or into everlasting arrangements.</p>
        <p>If you like bird watching, cut an appropriate size hole in a large dried bottle gourd, then hang it securely in a tree. With luck a bird may take up residence. Children may also have fun painting the fancy small gourds on rainy or snowy days when power outages force them away from the home computer.</p>
        <p>Once you have gotten started with gourds, the sky's the limit. With a little imagination and a sharp craft knife, you can turn them into everything from decorative planters to musical instruments. That way, when archaeologists uncover your house someday, they will know that you kept the traditions of your ancestors.</p>
