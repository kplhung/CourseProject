        <p>It was to have been a joyful occasion - the dedication of the first Methodist Church in White Plains in 1975. But across the street, a farmer was burning brush. A spark from the fire ignited the new roof, and on the very day of its dedication the church burned to the ground.</p>
        <p>Resourceful parishioners sorted through the ashes, salvaging the hand-wrought nails. Work on a new church on the same foundation began the next day. It was completed in 1797, and there the building has stood for more than two centuries. It is the third oldest structure in the city and the only one on its original site.</p>
        <p>Last week, the building was dedicated again - in honor of its restoration - and the event was far less dramatic than the first. The building is now used as a caretaker's house at the White Plains Rural Cemetery, but the exterior has been restored to look much as it did 200 years ago.</p>
