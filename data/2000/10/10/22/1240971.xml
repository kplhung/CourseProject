        <p>I am writing to applaud the efforts of Joe Kelly for his Dads and Daughters organization (''Dad, Do You Think I Look Too Fat?'' Sept. 17). I was 27 when I finally received successful treatment for anorexia nervosa, after its first being diagnosed when I was 12.</p>
        <p>The roots of my disease were multifaceted, but two major influences were my mother's own issues with food and my father's hypercriticalness, which often meant comments about my body.</p>

        <p>I feel hopeful that the message Joe Kelly is sending will raise awareness and prevent young girls from sliding down a slippery slope that could lead to years and possibly decades of suffering.</p>
