        <p>When Carla A. Harris, an investment banker with the rank of managing director in equity transactions at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, talks about a new issue, she is not necessarily talking about stocks. She has just released her first CD, a compilation of carols, called ''Carla's First Christmas.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Harris sang in both pop and rhythm-and-blues bands while completing her undergraduate degree and M.B.A. at Harvard. ''I've been singing all of my life, primarily R&amp;B and gospel,'' she said. The album followed naturally, she said, explaining, ''Christmas music is one of my favorite genres.''</p>

        <p>When Carla A.

        <p>Ms. Harris sang in both pop and rhythm-and-blues bands while completing her undergraduate degree and M.B.A. at Harvard. ''I've been singing all of my life, primarily R&amp;B and gospel,'' she said. The album followed naturally, she said, explaining, ''Christmas music is one of my favorite genres.''</p>
        <p>She has been with Morgan Stanley for 13 years -- ''Investment banking is something I'm very passionate about'' -- but most of her clients don't even know about her singing.</p>
        <p>''I try to keep that separate; generally I don't mix the two,'' she said. ''It's important to have balance in one's life. You can look at this as the other part of the scale for me.''</p>
        <p>Profits from the album (available from Amazon.com) will go toward scholarships at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic School in the Bronx and Bishop Kenny High School in Jacksonville, Fla., Ms. Harris's alma mater.</p>
        <p>''That is probably what I am most excited about,'' she said. ''I don't want a few thousand dollars to stand in the way for a smart African-American student.''</p>
