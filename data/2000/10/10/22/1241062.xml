        <p>Bales of hay lie scattered across charcoal-black soil. There is a hint of winter in the wind blowing through rows of golden cornstalks and green grass, an air of peace over this prairie now that the harvest is nearly done.</p>
        <p>Yet, the mood here is bittersweet.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years, nearly 2,000 farmers in North Dakota alone and thousands more across the country have left agriculture. After leaner years and more tumultuous times for farmers here, the Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency in Fargo says that by all appearances this year's harvest will be better than average.</p>
        <p>The production of canola, corn for grain, soybeans and alfalfa hay all reflect gains over last year's harvest. The sugar beet crop is expected to be the third largest on record.</p>
        <p>But even with a bountiful harvest, farming is still a tentative prospect for many in the business.</p>
        <p>''Right now, it's a precarious situation as people consider their futures,'' said Scott Stofferahn, the Farm Service Agency's executive director in North Dakota.</p>
        <p>''When you talk to farmers out here, they tell you that the majority of their income, darn near all of it, is coming from government payments,'' Mr. Stofferahn said. ''They know without it they can't make their installments on their notes. So this big cloud is hanging over their heads: 'What is the future? Will I be able to survive it?' ''</p>
        <p>At 66, Albert Hefta is holding on. A farmer for all of his life, he has 2,200 acres on a spread three miles northwest of here. For him, there is something about farming, something that gets in the blood, even when the future is uncertain.</p>
        <p>''I like to be out there in the peace and quiet,'' said Mr. Hefta, a short, hefty man with a tobacco-stained smile and leathery face. ''You're your own boss.''</p>
        <p>His land is anchored by giant bins, a white frame house, a red barn, a fleet of machinery and several head of steer. Mr. Hefta has seen small farmers fall by the wayside. The state lost 16 percent of its farms during the turbulent 80's, and 9 percent more, or 3,000 farms, over the last decade. Mr. Hefta managed to survive, in part, on the revenue from the dairy cows he had for many years. This year, his bins, all 17 of them, are running over.</p>
        <p>''We've got a pretty good crop this year,'' he said, smiling. Still, this year's harvest is not likely to translate into enough profits for his brother, Charles, 59, and him to hire the extra help they could use.</p>
        <p>''Can't afford to hire; you'd go broke,'' Mr. Hefta said.</p>
        <p>There are few things still left for the picking here. Corn mostly, burned-brown sunflowers and the last of the sugar beets. But recent rains make work a soggy proposition. Kenard Knudson, who farms about 1,275 acres southwest of Portland, was in the field until about 8 p.m. when the rains came the other night. He still has a few soybeans to harvest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knudson and his wife, Loretta, live on a farm with 60 head of beef cattle. Mr. Knudson, 73, grew up on a farm homesteaded in 1879 by his grandfather, Knut S. Knudson, about four and a half miles west of his own farm. The Knudsons have reared two children on farming. Their son, Kipp, 25, has a degree in economics and financial management, and their daughter, Kari, is a third-year law student at the University of North Dakota. Kipp Knudson is going to run the family farm, a prospect that frightens his mother, given these difficult times for farmers.</p>
        <p>''He says he'll make it,'' Mrs. Knudson said. ''I'm scared. He's not.'' For now, their thoughts are on the harvest.</p>
        <p>''It's a time of optimism and hope,'' Mrs. Knudson, 60, said. ''It's what we all look forward to after all the planning in the winter months. It's a cycle.''</p>
        <p>Mike Workin knows that cycle well. His sons, Daniel, 18, and Scott, 12, used to fall asleep at his feet in his tractor while he tended his wheat and soybeans on 1,100 acres, 700 of which he leased. Farming was nice, said Mr. Workin, 45, a soft-spoken man with a neatly trimmed beard. ''It gets in the blood.''</p>
        <p>But three years ago, he decided to quit.</p>
        <p>''I had operating money for the next year,'' Mr. Workin said. ''I just called the bank back and told them I didn't need it. The hardest thing to do was to line up the auction and watch your machinery go down the road.'' He remembers crying.</p>
        <p>He is smiling now, standing on the lot of the Farmers Union Oil gas station in Portland, where he works as an attendant. It's a good job, predictable, with benefits. Mr. Workin and his wife, Judy, a certified nurse assistant, and their four children, including daughters Brittani, 14, and JoAnna, 11, still live on a 250-acre farm about 17 miles southwest of here in Steele County. He leases his land to other farmers. He sold the rest.</p>
        <p>''I dreamed I'd hand it down to my son one day,'' he said of his younger son, his words somewhat slower and choked with emotion. ''He would have been the farmer. He just had it in his blood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Workin climbs into his red pickup and heads home through the cold and the lingering harvest.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Sunday about financial problems of farmers in North Dakota referred incorrectly in some copies to the age of Kipp Knudson, who wants to run his family's farm there. He is 25, not 23. In some copies the article misstated the year his great-grandfather Knut S. Knudson homesteaded an earlier family farm. It was 1879, not 1829.</p>
