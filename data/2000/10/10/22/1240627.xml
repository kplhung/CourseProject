        <p>Oliver Clark, the actor, cook, magician, mechanical-bank collector, folk-art enthusiast and one of the all-time 10-best brilliant dinner guests, pours olive oil into a pan and tosses in half a head of garlic with the theatrical flourish that is one of his many trademarks. He stands in a friend's kitchen, whipping up meat loaf and rigatoni, and it reminds me of the time we worked on a musical together.</p>
        <p>''I got this pasta from Malcolm and Kelley McDowell, and you must put the garlic in the oil before the tomatoes or the oil will never -''he relishes the word -in-fu-u-se.'' Oliver is the only person I know who does imitations not only of Gielgud, Richardson and Albert Finney but also of Maya Angelou. The tomato-garlic homily is his Gielgud.</p>
        <p>The TV talk show I worked on for many years taped at 5:30 p.m., and when it was over at around 7, I'd frequently meet Oliver for dinner. He weighed 320 then and has fought weight most of his life, bungeeing all the way down to 170, only to fly up 100 pounds a few months later. Right now he's about 220 and, as always, on guard.</p>
        <p>''When I die,'' he says, ''they will come up with a pill that has your ideal weight on it. If you take a pill marked 178 in the morning, you can eat anything you want, and at day's end you'll weigh 178. But it won't happen in time for me to enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>Oliver grew up working the grill in his dad's blue-collar restaurant in Buffalo, and so he likes direct food, like the meat loaf he is preparing. Back in our musical days, we'd usually have a prime rib and tomato-blue-cheese-salad at Beefsteak Charlie's or some other midlevel red-meat palace, though occasionally we'd go on a bender (his acting career was flourishing, and my TV talk show was paying well) at Palm or Peter Luger, because, as Oliver intoned in his self-parodizing British baritone, ''You can get many beeves, good Jonathan, all of them pri-i-ime.''</p>
        <p>After dinner we'd usually walk uptown, fooling ourselves into thinking that a postprandial of 40 blocks would neutralize the billion or so calories we'd just horsed down. Usually the freewheeling conversation revolved around the theater, politics, food and people we knew. On one of those strolls (''Let us walk against the elements, wearing good tweeds, hands clasped behind backs,'' was a customary invitation; he was in his Victorian period), I must have mentioned my interest in writing a musical, because that's what we did for several weeks.</p>
        <p>''I remember that musical,'' he says now, whacking away at the lids of a couple of portobellos for the meat loaf. ''You were completely bamboozled. Now listen to me: you must chop everything the same size as the ground beef so nothing stands out texturally.'' He brings out a green pepper and makes same-size pieces of it. ''I love me green pepper, but some people hate it. I'll leave it out if you want.'' No, I assure him, anything you put together will be excellent.</p>
        <p>''Excellent!'' We used to say this to each other all the time, it being a line from the musical ''Ben Franklin in Paris,'' in which he played Louis XVI. ''Excellent! A copy of this news to his Britannic majesty in London!'' is how I remember it. He loved the line because it was so silly. Acting is often silly -- that's part of its joy. We shortened it simply to ''Excellent!'' and said it so often that to this day, 20-plus years later, it is still part of my phraseology; and because it's difficult to spend an hour with Oliver without starting to sound like him, I say it with his intonation.</p>
        <p>When we started our musical, I was amazed at how adept he was at it. He came up with snippets of music that sounded quite commercial. He even came up with a credible story line. (A repressed Englishwoman falls in love with a rambunctious American, their parents are against it, she discovers herself.) Not wildly original, but something to hang a few songs and dances on.</p>
        <p>And his lyrics not only rhymed, they made sense. ''If you're smart,'' he'd start singing, boomba-ing the percussion between lines, ''do something crazy just for once.''</p>
        <p>If you're sma-a-art (ba boomba</p>
        <p>boomba)</p>
        <p>Do something foolish just for once</p>
        <p>(ba boomba boomba)</p>
        <p>Lose your he-e-ad</p>
        <p>And you might find your</p>
        <p>he-a-art!</p>
        <p>I couldn't improve on this but offered something rather feeble for another song. He mused on it, then haltingly began what we called the heroine's ''I Want'' number:</p>
        <p>The third finger of me left hand</p>
        <p>Is the loneliest place in town.</p>
        <p>The improvisation materialized into a song over several weeks. After a few minutes of working at it, we'd run out of steam and start in on how to stuff pork chops.</p>
        <p>Today, back at Meat Loaf Central, Oliver adds cream cheese to the other ingredients, then paws at the mixture with two forks. ''If you mix too much, the meat gets tough.'' He pushes the loaf into the oven. ''Now all we have to do is boil the rigatoni. And that, as they say in France . . . is . . . that.''</p>
        <p>After a month or so of our strolling songwriting sessions, we had a complete story line and four or five plausible songs. With titles! ''The Right Finger of My Left Hand,'' ''The Uncle Sam Rag,'' ''I Feel Merely Marvelous.'' These sound like possible Broadway tunes, don't they? Not as good as ''The Music Man,'' maybe (what score is?), but I found myself humming them at all hours; in fact, I told my girlfriend Bridget that I thought Oliver and I had a real shot at Broadway and fantasized entering some junior version of the Loesser-Lerner-Hammerstein pantheon, and even entertained quitting my talk show. ''Most amazing is that Oliver has pretty much done the whole thing himself,'' I said. ''I come up with brainchildren, he has better ones. I had no idea he could write music. And he's so clever with lyrics.''</p>
        <p>I sang ''our'' songs constantly. After I'd announced our musical to several friends and was about to go seriously public with our boffo smash, Oliver became less inspired in his tunesmithery. I was sure he was becoming inhibited by the possibility of success, and encouraged him every time we did our hands-clasped promenade. Then one night he stopped by my apartment, an LP tucked under his arm. ''Listen to this, my lad,'' he said, plopping the record onto a turntable.</p>
        <p>For those of you even less perceptive than I (hard to imagine), what happened next may be a surprise. Out from the speakers came brassy, orchestrated maxi-versions of our songs. The lyrics differed slightly from ours, but only slightly. I was stunned. ''What is this?'' I said. Had he had our songs recorded?</p>
        <p>''No, Jonathan. It's on Broadway. Now! It's called 'Redhead.' ''I think my dropped jaw was the funniest thing he'd ever seen. ''Redhead,'' with a score by Albert Hague and Dorothy Fields, starred Gwen Verdon and Richard Kiley, had been directed by Fosse and was a memorable innocuity running at the time. Oliver was beside himself with laughter and dined out on the story many times. I wasn't angry, just bewildered -- and feeling foolish.</p>
        <p>''What I loved most,'' says Oliver, laughing as he swirls the rigatoni into Malcolm and Kelley's pink sauce, ''is that you actually sang the songs for people!'' We sit down to the meat loaf -- direct, flavorful and bursting with juices -- and the subtle, delicious pasta, and chortle again over the many curious things we've done together. Like the time we . . . but that's another story.</p>
        <p>In the early 70's, Oliver moved to Los Angeles, landed two series and dozens of parts in movies-of-the-week and features. I didn't see much of him during those years, but when I did visit Hollywood, we spent many evenings together. We'd dine either at Musso &amp; Frank's, which reminded him of New York and at which he had a table, or at Palm, where his caricature adorned the wall. He had arrived.</p>
        <p>Some years after the great ''Redhead'' fiasco, I decided to marry. There was no second choice for best man. At the rehearsal dinner at Lut ce, if he wanted to, Oliver could have charmed the jewelry off my aunt's throat, persuaded my future father-in-law to put up seed money for his new yet growing folk-art collection and levitated the room. He did none of those things, except for the levitation of the room.</p>
