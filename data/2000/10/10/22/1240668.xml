        <p>Article on move by Duke University's medical school and Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to supply Ardais Corp, Massachusetts biotech company, with leftover tissue in exchange for free access to Ardais's planned tissue library, research grants and small equity interests in company; photo (M)</p>

        <p>A Different Sort Of Donation  A tumor, an inflamed joint, a piece of cancerous cartilage. Until recently, when these and other problem tissues were removed at a hospital, they might be subject to a few diagnostic tests before being incinerated. Then researchers realized such tissues might help their search for cures and started to save them -- but less than comprehensively. Now the private sector is out to change that. Last month, Duke University's medical school and Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center agreed to supply Ardais Corporation, a biotech company in Lexington, Mass., with leftover tissue in exchange for free access to Ardais's planned tissue library, research grants and small equity interests in the company (the profits from which are supposed to be spent only on research). Eric Gordon, the C.E.O. of Ardais, denies that lucre is the only motive here. ''This is about eliminating suffering,'' he says. Still, he admits that Ardais could make some people very rich selling tissue data to genetic researchers. ''And there's nothing wrong with that,'' he adds.</p>
        <p>Don't Try This At Home  People already sell their own blood and sperm -- so what's to stop them from selling directly to companies like Ardais whatever tissue they want? The law, for one; since 1984 it has been illegal to sell your own organs. Also, both Duke and Ardais note that tissue is valuable only as part of a huge sample set. One sample alone is worthless. And, says Jeremy Sugarman, director of the Center for the Study of Medical Ethics and Humanities at Duke, ''You'd have to be kind of dubious about a company buying tissue off an individual -- and wonder how well your privacy would be protected.''</p>

        <p>Private Parts?  When the medical institutions collaborating with Ardais begin collecting tissue this winter, surgical patients will receive lots of reading material written at the eighth-grade level and then be asked for their consent before the procedure. Gordon claims those patients who might demur because of confidentiality concerns -- what if researchers pass along information to an employer? -- have no reason to worry. Ardais's ''double firewall'' system, which replaces names with bar codes that can be linked to patients only at the hospital, is supposed to prevent identity exposure.</p>
