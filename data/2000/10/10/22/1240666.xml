        <p>Helen Dixon, Winters, Calif., August 1955  ''I was feeling terrible. It was both the heat and the pregnancy -- just a short while after that I gave birth to my second son, who was 11 pounds. I was wondering if this should be just the normal birth, especially since he was such a large baby, or whether I should have a Caesarean. You have funny feelings in those last few weeks. You just can hardly wait until the birth.</p>

        <p>''Dorothea photographed all the time. You got used to it. She was my mother-in-law, and I admired a lot of things she did. I admired her tenacity because she was sick so much of the time. But we were building that house at the time. Dorothea had an awful lot of input. That caused kind of friction, and so I got to the point where I really hated the house. Between pregnancy and all of that, it just got to be so much. I can't say that I love that photograph, simply because I was so miserable at the time.''</p>
