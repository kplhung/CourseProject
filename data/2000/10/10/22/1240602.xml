        <p>One Drop of Blood</p>
        <p>The American</p>
        <p>Misadventure of Race. By Scott L. Malcomson.</p>
        <p>584 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>ARE you really white? Are you really black? Would it offend you if I asked? In all likelihood, yes, even if upon reflection you would add, correctly, that it shouldn't matter. And, of course, like all couth readers of the Book Review, you are firmly of the view that race has no scientific basis. So why the unease and why the haste to change the subject?</p>
        <p>Asking an American if he is really white is like asking him if he is really male, a question that could be mortally hazardous in many parts of this land. Despite all the talk within the academy of ''hybridity'' and ''socially constructed identities,'' most citizens of this country view race as rooted in nature, like sex or age -- a marker of identity that you see in the mirror, in your family and in the people you encounter daily. The strangest thing about this conviction is that no other nation's history and culture more compellingly demonstrate the fluidity and sheer unnaturalness of racial identity.</p>
        <p>Over the centuries America has made and remade the white and other so-called races with abandon. A century ago the Irish were not white but ''Negroes turned inside out,'' while Negroes were ''smoked Irish.'' The immigration act of 1921 was passed to keep the very different and ''inferior'' races of southern Europe, as well as Jews, from contaminating white people. Jews entered the Caucasian chalk circle only after World War II, Italians having squeaked in a little earlier, although many non-Italians continue to harbor doubts. And the nation's Census Bureau has had such a thoroughly bizarre history of racial categorization that recently, out of sheer conceptual and political exhaustion, it gave up and asked people to classify themselves in any and as many racial ways as the spirit moved them.</p>
        <p>In the past decade or so a remarkable body of work within the academy has challenged our received notions about the formation of racial identity in America. Stimulated by the classic works on American racial history by Winthrop Jordan and Edmund Morgan, and by the turn in social theory toward the view that most of our cherished categories are not absolutes but conventions that change across time and place, a young group of scholars has generated some of the most exciting works of cultural and social history in recent times. The designation sometimes applied to these works -- whiteness studies'' -- is an awful misnomer, not only because its implications are as critical for nonwhites as for whites, but because it refers to two very different kinds of scholarship. One school seeks to abolish whiteness, while the other seeks a politically acceptable way of expressing white pride and cultural distinctiveness that all too closely resembles that other white identity movement known as white supremacy.</p>
        <p>Scott L. Malcomson falls firmly into the camp of the abolitionists, as the historian Noel Ignatiev calls them. And what the abolitionists have shown is that European settlers in the New World began to imagine themselves as ''white'' soon after their arrival on these shores. Over time, whiteness became a powerful, flexible means of uniting these otherwise disparate men and women, for it defined them against Native Americans, African slaves and, finally, against the group that was to become America's domesticated Other: African-Americans. The ''one-drop rule'' was the foundation of this process, and by the late 19th century it had become a virtual law of nature among white Americans. As Malcomson points out, ''A little 'black blood' could make you black, but it took a great deal of 'white blood' to render a person white. . . . The sum of what you were not -- Indian, black, slave -- made you what you were.'' And it still does. The proposition that whiteness, as such, has no content but is rather a negation, the identity of not-being-black, is a shocking revelation to most white Americans, who continue to imagine that there is a nonracist way of defining their whiteness in positive terms, although they are tongue-tied when asked to say what it is. Were the nation ever to acknowledge this, the result would be a cultural revolution that would outdo the 1960's.</p>
        <p>The great achievement of Malcomson's new book, ''One Drop of Blood,'' is to harvest these insights from their academic greenhouses, make them accessible to the broader American public and move us toward a redemptive embrace of their wider implications. He seems to have been born for the role. A gifted if sometimes undisciplined writer, with an acute eye for paradox, he is as at home with the cultivation of ideas as the academics who have paved the way for him, but he is not bridled by their conventions. He is capable of absorbing and integrating vast quantities of knowledge from a wide range of sources, as his travel books on Central Asia and the South Pacific demonstrated. He is the perfect age for the task, a post-civil-rights baby blessed with genuinely liberal parents who could take the achievements of the 60's for granted rather than spend his life marveling at them. Growing up with Chinese and African-American friends in multiracial Oakland when its schools were still integrated, he emerged mercifully free of any need to ingratiate himself with nonwhites or to be unctuously oversensitive in his dealings with them.</p>
        <p>The potential of this work, then, lies in Malcomson's refreshing insistence that race is not only a matter of equal concern to whites but that the African-American experience in all its richness is as deep and personal a matter to him -- a young white American determined to know his culture and himself -- as it is to the most soul-drenched African-American. Malcomson not only crosses but audaciously attempts to erase the border between insider and outsider perspectives on race. Few white intellectuals have gone this far. The consequences that follow from these assertions are explosive and exhilarating, for both Malcomson and his audience. But there are also dangers.</p>
        <p>Malcomson's vision boldly embraces America's entire history of race. His explorations -- or rather, his jazzy, intensely reflective variations on the findings of others -- are organized into four parts, each tracing, from their origins to the present, the respective racial histories of Indians, African-Americans, white Americans and Oakland, Malcomson's hometown. Each of the first three parts is sandwiched between reports from the present, a technique that works awkwardly at best. (The account of Malcomson's sermon before a group of white-separatist Christian fundamentalists is particularly jarring: it strikes a false tone and stands out like a thick stroke of deadened color against the book's bright, finely wrought texture.)</p>
        <p>A major theme of the book is racial separatism, as Malcomson traces the futile attempts by all three groups to ''escape'' race by building racially pure communities. Having lost their ancestral lands, Indians yearned for their own state, ending up today with homelands whose main economic hope lies in casinos patronized by white gamblers. Black separatism began with the nearly insane idea of colonization -- the return of blacks to Africa -- a notion rejected by the great majority of African-Americans but pursued by black nationalists like Marcus Garvey and often abetted by white purists, including Presidents Jefferson and Lincoln. Later, black separatism evolved into the hopeless call for a black state carved out of Western lands, an idea that still thrives in Afrocentrist fantasies. White separatism in the Jim Crow South was the most dangerous of all, since it was backed by force, and since it aimed to establish a pure white body politic in which a planter elite depended on an exploited class of black laborers.</p>
        <p>The greatest irony of America's separatist history, Malcomson argues, is the fact that ''the racial contest was over ideological or psychological materials that were remarkably similar and in many ways identical.'' At all periods of American history, ''those preoccupied with racial destinies walked about in a forest of mirrors.'' No wonder, then, that Marcus Garvey developed close friendships with white separatists and that today white separatists often simply borrow from the rhetoric of black separatists, as black separatist leaders had previously done with their ''defensive breastwork against whites.''</p>
        <p>Malcomson brings the tragedy of Indian-white relations to life not only in cogent commentaries on the Indians' resistance to encroachment on their lands, but through concise and vivid portrayals of the lives of early-19th-century Indians like the Cherokee leaders Elias Boudinot and John Ridge, who, after becoming the perfect models of assimilation, were used and betrayed by their white allies in the nearly genocidal forced removal of their people, and later assassinated as collaborators by angry Cherokee nationalists. And he highlights an aspect of this entanglement that modern multiculturalists would just as soon forget: that African-Americans, as slaves to both Indians and whites, quickly became the common Other in the perverse triangulation of race. Even today, many Indians, while accepting the thousands of whites who have suddenly decided ''that their Indianness was, at some level, more precious than their whiteness,'' nonetheless wish to exclude Indians who look too black. There are no innocents in this horrible American misadventure, and this sometimes includes African-Americans who, when invited, did not hesitate to join genocidal assaults against the Indians.</p>
        <p>Malcomson then turns to the invention of blackness in America, the ways in which African-Americans came to know and define themselves as a race apart. The later chapters of this section are the best part of the book. His searching commentaries on the separatist ideologies of African-American leaders like Martin R. Delany, Marcus Garvey and Booker T. Washington, on ''the beautiful despair of the Harlem Renaissance,'' on the racial terror of the long decades between the 1920's and the 60's, and on the marvelous paradoxes of the civil rights movement are powerfully evocative, and carried through with an ardor and interpretive brilliance that rivals James Baldwin. This passage on the blues culture of ordinary African-Americans is typical: ''It was not so much racially separate as independent of race, even antiracial. . . . Whiteness had to be kept contingent, alterable, part of history rather than of nature; blues, blackness, then, defended these qualities. Among other things, it kept alive in our shared culture a spirit of nonracial humanity.''</p>
        <p>The book begins to falter with the third, long section, on white America. Because the racial identities of Indians and African-Americans are so entangled, Malcomson has already revealed his best insights on the development of whiteness in the course of his earlier discussions. The section on whites is not only repetitive but, particularly in its treatment of minstrelsy, oddly dated, in light of outstanding recent work by Eric Lott, W. T. Lhamon and others. And when Malcomson has nothing new to say he tends to substitute literary preciosity for substance, a fault that nearly undid his two previous books. Groping for the lapidary and smartly paradoxical phrase, he sometimes misses genuine paradoxes. Thus, it is simply not true that the one-drop rule did the opposite of what it intended and that the ''dream of racial essence . . . made the physical metaphysical.'' The real paradox here is that the one-drop rule succeeded all too well, so much so that its most devoted adherents today are African-Americans, in spite of its devastating role in their own history of exclusion.</p>
        <p>The last section, on Oakland, is really an autobiographical fragment, and the book would have been better without it. It is strange indeed that the closer Malcomson gets to his own world and his own whiteness, the more abstruse and elliptical he becomes. He recalls with sadness the sudden falling away of his African-American friends as he moves through high school and the fact that the ''black friends I had had were friends rather than black; now they were shifting to being black rather than friends.'' Why did this happen? Suddenly the whole purpose of the book seems to pivot on the answer to just this question, a bad move. We have been taken on a tour of America's entire racial history in preparation for this moment: understanding why this particular white soul, with the most humane and unprejudiced of parents and the most integrated public education that America has to offer, lost all his black friends with the nset of puberty. His answer: ''I honestly don't understand why.''</p>
        <p>This is maddening. How can Malcomson speak so perceptively and eloquently about the inner griefs and outward tragedies of Native Americans and African-Americans from the dawn of the nation's history, yet be void of insight about the subject on which he should be the greatest authority: his own racial past? Among other problems, it casts some doubt on the authenticity of what has gone before. Still, I am prepared to grant him the benefit of that doubt. For all its flaws this work remains a valuable contribution. Where it succeeds, it succeeds astonishingly well, and Malcomson has set a new standard of open, honest dialogue on race in America, especially that between Euro- and African-Americans. And where it fails, it fails trying hard to clear a path toward a place that few white Americans have ever cared to know.</p>
