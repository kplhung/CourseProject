        <p>With the Subway Series at last under way, it promises to be an eventful autumn week for some of the giant names in New York sports: Derek Jeter, Mike Piazza, Joe Torre, Dennis Conner.</p>
        <p>Dennis Conner?</p>
        <p>The first races to determine the challenger for the next America's Cup, the finals of which will be staged in New Zealand in early 2003, are expected to begin roughly two years from today. For New Yorkers, it is probably none too early to get used to the idea that the hometown favorite, the man with the mandate to return the cup to the Manhattan lair of the New York Yacht Club, is Dennis Conner.</p>
        <p>Yes, that Dennis Conner, the same man who was at the helm of the New York club's yacht when the cup was lost in 1983, thereby ending a local winning streak that had run for a mere 132 years. If the sight of Conner again hoisting the New York Yacht Club banner is jolting to some in headquarters on West 44th Street, Conner is unfazed.</p>
        <p>''I've been interested in racing for the club since we lost in '83,'' he said Friday in a telephone interview from his San Diego headquarters. ''It has a nice ring to it to be back. And if by some wonderful twist of fate we can win and bring it back to the yacht club and the Northeast 20 years after losing, it'd be a nice story.''</p>
        <p>In the last cup series, in which his Stars &amp; Stripes syndicate advanced to the semifinals of the challenger's round before being eliminated, Conner assumed a managerial position and handed the wheel to the multiple J/24-class world champion, Ken Read. It is a role Conner will repeat for the next cup regatta, as well.</p>
        <p>That is not to say Conner is not spending plenty of time with a tiller in his hand. Last summer, he took eighth place in the star-studded Etchells-class worlds off San Diego. And this weekend, he was sailing in a local event in the same hometown waters. On Tuesday, he will be in Bermuda to compete in the Colorcraft Gold Cup, the eighth and final event in this year's Swedish Match Grand Prix Racing Tour.</p>
        <p>Conner says that another pair of America's Cup veterans, Russell Coutts and Peter Gilmour, talked him into the Bermuda gig.</p>
        <p>''We were all at a regatta in Italy recently and they told me how much fun it is, and that I shouldn't pass it up,'' he said. Conner's crew for the match-racing event, to be sailed in Hamilton Harbor aboard 33-foot International One Designs, is the Bermuda sailor Paula Lewin and Conner's fellow San Diegans Chris Busch and Peter Burton.</p>
        <p>A qualifying round for the 16 unseeded teams begins today. Conner, Coutts and Gilmour -- along with the Kiwi Dean Barker, the American Ed Baird, who skippered the disappointing New York entry in the last cup, and three other seeded skippers -- get under way on Tuesday</p>
        <p>Conner was reluctant to reveal many details about his next America's Cup challenge -- he is waiting for the New York club to make an official statement, due in about six weeks. But he did say that the yacht designers John Reichel and Jim Pugh had been signed on to create two boats that would be built at Rhode Island's New England Boatworks.</p>
        <p>Because of the time demands of the cup, he also said he would regrettably pass up the Volvo Race. His teams have been a fixture for the last several runnings of the round-the-world event.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that the timing is going to hurt the entry list for the Volvo,'' Conner said. ''I think if the Bees hadn't come onto the cup scene like they did, there would've been more interest in it. But all that money has attracted the interest.''</p>
        <p>By the Bees, Conner is referring to the billionaires who have announced challenges for the next cup, including the Americans Larry Ellison and Craig McCaw, and Ernesto Bertarelli from Switzerland. Gilmour and Coutts, respectively, have signed on to the latter pair's campaigns.</p>
        <p>''The cup's going back to the era of the Morgans and the Vanderbilts, where the really wealthy guys of the world are out sailing boats again,'' Conner said. ''It could make it the best cup yet. Those guys will want the publicity to make sure their egos are gratified. I think they'll see to it that it's a big event.''</p>
        <p>But Conner also thinks there may be surprises in store, especially for those who believe the defender, Team New Zealand, has been hurt by the loss of Coutts and others. ''I have a different take on that,'' he said. ''There's so much depth of talent in New Zealand. They've still got world-class guys you never heard of. They'll still be difficult to beat.''</p>
        <p>Conner has never been shy with his opinions. And like any New Yorker -- or any underdog -- he also has a say about the other current event of interest. ''I'm a Yankee fan,'' he said. ''But I think the Mets are going to surprise them.''</p>
