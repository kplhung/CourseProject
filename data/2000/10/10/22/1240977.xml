        <p>The way she tells it, Muriel F. Siebert, founder of the Siebert Financial Corporation, the discount brokerage firm, has had every women's Web site in need of financial backing knocking on her door over the last couple of years.</p>

        <p>The way she tells it, Muriel F. Siebert, founder of the Siebert Financial Corporation, the discount brokerage firm, has had every women's Web site in need of financial backing knocking on her door over the last couple of years.</p>
        <p>''I would look at them, but I didn't see a business model,'' she said. ''I didn't see where the money was going to come back.''</p>
        <p>So without any one site to satisfy her, she has just bought two, for an undisclosed amount. Now the sites, wfn.com and HerDollar.com, will become the Women's Financial Network by Siebert (still at www.wfn.com), a means for women to learn about money management -- and  buy financial products from her firm. Thus, she expects to make back her buck.</p>
        <p>But why would anyone consult a women's financial site in the first place? There is a market, she said, for financial education without the trivia. ''I want serious information. I want a section there that says, 'O.K., your husband's dropped dead, what do you do?' '' she said. ''We're not going to have little stories of Sally May and Jessie Sue. I'm sorry. Some of these sites talk down to women.''</p>
        <p>She also plans to gear the revamped wfn.com toward entrepreneurial women, who, she noted,  now start companies at twice the rate of men.</p>
        <p>But she's not closing off the other half of the market. Men are welcome, too. ''We're not sexist,'' she said.</p>
