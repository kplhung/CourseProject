        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Andrew Sullivan, in his review of Gore Vidal's ''Golden Age'' (Oct. 1), comes away ''outraged'' by Vidal's historical fiction. Twice Sullivan dismisses as ''silly'' Vidal's assertion that Harry Truman's use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was unnecessary because Japan had been trying for some months to surrender.</p>
        <p>Such assertions are neither silly nor, as Sullivan suggested, a product of Vidal's ''cranky politics.'' Rather, Vidal has cleverly drawn on a rich and scholarly literature published in the last decade to remind his readers that much of what orthodox court historians have written about the cold war was simply wrong. With regard to Hiroshima, perhaps Vidal had in mind Truman's July 18, 1945, handwritten diary reference to a ''telegram from Jap emperor asking for peace.'' Or this Aug. 3, 1945, item from the diary of Walter Brown, special assistant to Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, who was on the U.S.S. Augusta with Truman and Adm. William D. Leahy: ''Aboard Augusta/President, Leahy, J.F.B. agreed Japs looking for peace.'' Clearly, Truman and his advisers believed they had good reason to think that the Japanese were trying to negotiate a surrender. But they also had an atomic bomb, and they wanted to use it.</p>
        <p>With such evidence lying about, how could any great writer of historical fiction fail to challenge what Vidal wryly calls ''the agreed-upon historical record''?</p>
