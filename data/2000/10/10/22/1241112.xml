        <p>The police said yesterday that they had seized hundreds of counterfeit World Series tickets and arrested 14 men in three schemes. And the police warned fans that if they bought from scalpers, they could end up with bogus tickets.</p>
        <p>Chief of Department Joseph J. Esposito, speaking at a news conference where he displayed dozens of sheets of phony tickets, said that the counterfeiting schemes were widespread and that some of the tickets were very good reproductions.</p>
        <p>''I do not believe we have stopped the sale of phony tickets that will be out there for this series,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Flanked by detectives from the Manhattan Gang Investigation Division, whose work led to the largest ticket seizure, Esposito noted that in one case, hundreds of counterfeit tickets were printed for the same three seats in Yankee Stadium. He said that if the fakes were not caught by ticket takers, crowds of fans could end up vying for the same seat.</p>
        <p>While the police sought to warn those seeking tickets from scalpers, fans trying to buy World Series tickets legitimately ran into other problems. The Mets put 15,000 tickets on sale by phone yesterday morning. But the volume of calls -- in the millions, according to a Verizon spokesman, John Bonomo -- was so great that it jammed phone lines, producing rapid busy signals for many callers.</p>
        <p>Twenty-nine people were caught last night for scalping tickets, and five of them involved forged tickets, Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman said. Preliminary figures showed the the police also found 23 people peddling merchandise without a license, he said.</p>
        <p>Giammarino said he was not sure how many summons had been handed out for those infractions.</p>
