        <p>COUNTY Executive Andrew J. Spano has proposed a $60.5 million capital budget for 2001 that includes $12.2 million for road projects and almost $10 million to improve county parks.</p>
        <p>The proposal is $227,000 less than the capital budget Mr. Spano submitted for the current fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano, a Democrat, also delivered proposed capital budgets for Westchester's sewer, water and refuse disposal districts, which at $35.2 million amount to less than half of 2000's combined district budgets. The current year's budgets included $43.5 million in projects that were required under a consent decree with the state to preserve the environment, Long Island Sound and the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>''At first glance, these budgets look very good,'' said Richard G. Wishnie, a Democrat from Briarcliff Manor and chairman of the county legislature's Budget and Appropriations Committee. He said Mr. Spano was planning ahead and avoiding ''spikes in spending'' resulting from unanticapitated expenses.</p>
        <p>But Katherine S. Carsky, a Republican member of the legislature's Budget and Appropriations Committee, said, ''I'm glad to see it's reduced, but that should not lull us into a false sense of expectations regarding future spending.''</p>
        <p>She observed that the county faced future capital expenses, among them upgrading or replacing the County Jail in Valhalla. Furthermore, she said, the capital expenses budget calls for spending $2.5 million to construct a sewer system to serve the Quarry Heights section of North Castle. ''Other communities may ask for the same in the future.''</p>
        <p>The capital budget, which will be financed by issuing bonds, includes the following:</p>
        <p>*Airport: $4.72 million for new projects, including $500,000 toward creation of a buffer around the Kensico Reservoir.</p>
        <p>*Open Space and the Environment: $5 million for open space acquisition.</p>
        <p>*Affordable Housing: $19.6 million to acquire land for new homes.</p>
        <p>*Information Technology: $4.55 million for technology initiatives.</p>
        <p>*Buildings and Miscellaneous: $6 million to modernize Social Services district offices in White Plains and Peekskill; $4.5 million to upgrade county office space, and $1.5 million to replace air-conditioning equipment.</p>
        <p>*Parkways, Roads and Bridges: $12.2 million for 14 projects.</p>
        <p>*Recreation: $9.8 million to improve parks, including modernizing Willson's Woods Pool in Mount Vernon and construction of an aquatic playground at the Sprain Ridge Pool in Yonkers; an additional soccer field at V. E. Macy Park in Greenburgh; and $1.85 million for new rides for Playland Amusement Park.</p>
        <p>*Transportation: $9.52 million for replacement vehicles and improvements to the Yonkers Bus Garage.</p>
