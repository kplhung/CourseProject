        <p>In the hills over Los Angeles on the Fourth of July, it was possible for a moment to believe that Republican Congressman James Rogan and Democratic State Senator Adam Schiff did not loathe each other.

        <p>In the hills over Los Angeles on the Fourth of July, it was possible for a moment to believe that Republican Congressman James Rogan and Democratic State Senator Adam Schiff did not loathe each other. They were opponents in what was shaping up as the most expensive Congressional race in the history of the republic -- and one of the fiercest -- and yet there they were chatting amiably in the morning sunshine near the convertibles that would carry them in the day's first parade, two suburban white guys trading updates on their kids.</p>
        <p>My attention wandered to the blonde perched nearby in a red Cadillac convertible. And froze there. ''Do you know Susan?'' Rogan asked without enthusiasm. Yes, it was she. Susan Carpenter-McMillan -- once the spokeswoman for Paula Jones and now a candidate for a California State Assembly seat -- was as vehement as ever as she alighted from her car. Had I heard, she wondered in that scratchy, unconquerable voice of hers, what it was that everyone said about her and Jim Rogan? And I thought, Together -- she as a Valkyrie for Jones and he as an impeachment prosecutor on the floor of the Senate -- they almost toppled the president of the United States? No! The correct answer was weird hair. ''They always ask if Jim's hair is a toupee!'' she said, laughing raucously. ''And they always make fun of my hairspray!''</p>
        <p>A few moments later, when I caught up with Rogan, he was speaking quietly with an elegantly dressed silver-haired man. I stood to the side, near a six-foot neon-yellow Pikachu and a portly green Power Ranger who were observing the congressman as they awaited their turns in the parade. They did not seem much impressed. ''It's all fund-raising,'' Pikachu informed the Ranger.</p>
        <p>That sure seemed to be the case. Because Rogan's impeachment crusade made him vulnerable in this increasingly Democratic district and because this was one of a few close races that would determine which party controlled the House, the Rogan-Schiff contest already looked like the politico ad absurdum of our times, when fund-raising records are tumbling at every level of national government and even a State Assembly seat can run upward of a million dollars. For more than a year, Schiff and Rogan had been working the phones, the mail and the rubber sea-bass circuit, raking in millions from across the country. Where some saw wretched excess, others saw opportunity. With more than 50 candidates raising more than $1 million by midsummer, House races like this one were drawing the kind of professional political consultants you used to find only at the national level. And those consultants were finding plenty of ways to spend the money. Already by July 4, 22 House candidates had spent more than $1 million apiece. The most bruising part of the campaign lay ahead, but the two candidates in California's 27th Congressional District had already spent $5,325,855.25 -- and figured to spend perhaps another $5 million before it was over. All for one House seat, just one, out of 435.</p>
        <p>As the parade started, Rogan and Schiff took their places ahead of the firemen, the two little gymnasts on the skittish white horse and the inexplicable guy in the gorilla mask riding on a pickup's hood. The candidates' cars made a slow serpentine between the sidewalks, down Foothill Boulevard in the suburb of Sunland-Tujunga. Legs over the convertibles' back seats, the candidates sat out in the open, waving and making remarks, each after his own fashion. Schiff, the Democrat, stuck to wishing people a happy Independence Day and a nice weekend. Rogan, the Republican, joked about horse droppings. His constituents freely shared their own views. ''Get a new rug!'' one man hollered at Rogan.</p>
        <p>Making The Dough Rise  Matt Keelen, a 30-year-old Rogan consultant, grew up around politics and the dining trade, which together with his easygoing manner and entrepreneurial drive may explain his choice of profession. Keelen's father had been mayor in his hometown of Keansburg on the New Jersey Shore, and his parents owned sports bars. They were Democrats, but Keelen came of age at a time of national Republican excitement and Democratic malaise. He also came of age when a career in the business of politics had acquired some of the same professional gravity as a career in medicine or law.</p>
        <p>After college, Keelen headed to Washington, where he hoped to work on Capitol Hill. Instead, he found work making fund-raising calls and earned a few extra dollars tending bar. At night, he studied toward a master's degree from the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University. He was not, and is not, cynical about his chosen field. ''I was raised believing you could do good in politics,'' he said. Just as other students ground away at Chaucer or organic chemistry, Keelen studied developing a message, raising money and the work he most enjoyed, making ads. Admen are the celebrities of the political trade, overpaid by candidates and hyped by reporters as puissant lizards of Oz. But those jobs are hard to come by.</p>
        <p>Keelen's work, meanwhile, soon took him to the political action committee, or PAC, for the National Restaurant Association and then to a fund-raising firm. In December 1997, he hung out his own shingle as a political specialist. He went into business as a PAC fund-raiser, that is, a consultant dedicated to raising money from the political organizations (of labor, business and other groups) dedicated to dispensing it. He would make the calls, engineer the meetings, build the friendships that Republican House candidates could cash in on -- for a retainer, an event fee or a commission of 10 percent or so, after expenses. In 1997, he landed Jim Rogan's account by promising to raise $40,000 for him in about 10 days and delivering. Keelen doesn't believe in just serving wine and cubed cheese. He takes PAC directors to a ballgame or serves them a meal. He is his parents' son. He eventually raised more than $650,000 for Rogan before the '98 election.</p>
        <p>These days, Keelen employs five people and works for 25 House candidates. But he is starry-eyed when it comes to Rogan -- I'd do anything for Jim,'' he told me -- and he went right back to the PAC's for him after he won in 1998. Keelen was one of the first people employed for the 2000 campaign.</p>
        <p>Raising money was the earliest, highest priority of both campaigns. Schiff hired two fund-raisers before he hired a campaign manager. He had to employ a ''call time'' aide in Sacramento and secure a space and telephone there so that he could squeeze in calls to donors between his legislative duties. Ted Osthelder, Schiff's campaign manager, had, like many Democratic operatives, studied finance techniques with Emily's List, a political network for Democratic women. In its methodical primer, ''Making the Dough Rise,'' Emily's List breaks down potential donors into four ''circles,'' starting in close with ''family'' and progressing out through ''power,'' meaning those who see some financial or other benefit in the candidate's election. PAC's tend to fit in the power circle. To reach them, Schiff early this year hired a PAC fund-raiser in Washington, Tom Erickson.</p>
        <p>Some PAC's, like that of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, were able to pony up the maximum legal contribution of $10,000 to Schiff, but his average PAC donation has been closer to $1,700. (Rogan's has been about $1,000.) It has taken a lot of effort to accumulate hundreds of thousands of these dollars. Schiff, the unknown challenger, has had to spend more time calling on friendly PAC directors. Rogan, the incumbent, has been able to hold more events for groups of PAC directors. Keelen, who has found himself eating three lunches in a day that also includes breakfast and dinner events for his candidates, marvels that he does not weigh 500 pounds.</p>
        <p>For all that work, PAC's have supplied less than 20 percent of the candidates' funds. Most of their money has come from individuals, as it does for most House candidates. Oliver Stone sent money to Rogan, while Barbra Streisand lent her name to a brunch for Schiff. John McCain raised $70,000 with a speech for Rogan, and Bill Clinton pulled in $225,000 for Schiff during just one dinner in D.C. Each candidate has also dialed for dollars thousands of times. As Keelen puts it with apt redundancy, ''Fund-raising is a long, tedious, boring process.''</p>
        <p>The record for spending in a House contest is $8.9 million, set in Newt Gingrich's race in 1996 -- the same year Rogan was first elected to Congress. By the end of September, Rogan had raised $5.8 million and Schiff had raised $3.6 million. In the end, the race is likely to cost more than $10 million. Yet here is a surprise about the emphasis both Rogan and Schiff placed on fund-raising: neither man found that he had to spend more time doing it than he had in the past. That is, for all the muscle they have put into shaking the money tree, for all the cash that has fallen down, the chore has not struck either man as more onerous than usual. ''It's an interesting paradox,'' Rogan mused over lunch one day. ''I spent probably 10 times more time trying to raise $400,000 for a State Assembly race than I've spent raising $4 million for this House race.''</p>
        <p>But it's not a paradox at all. Thanks to the bandwagon effect of political finance, the more money you raise, the more money you raise; this explains why the parties are so eager to boast about revoltingly high-dollar events. Further, thanks to the scare tactics of political finance, the more money your opponent raises, the more money you raise, provided you are competitive to begin with.</p>
        <p>The trump card of the PAC fund-raisers has had nothing to do with the district's dreams or the candidates' records. Keelen has simply reminded wavering donors that there are only a handful of Congressional races this close, and that the first vote cast by the new congressman will be for either Speaker Hastert or Speaker Gephardt.</p>
        <p>Is Spending, Not Fund-Raising, The Real Campaign Scandal?  We have had several years now of dark warnings about the quids pro quo fat-cat contributors get for their donations. But, in a more literal sense, it is not clear that donors ever really know what they are getting for their money when it comes to the campaigns themselves. Campaign-finance watchdogs are much more interested in getting than spending. Yet it is the spending that starts the money chase -- spending on consultants, TV ads and receptions to raise more money. Three thousand miles from the palmy, sunbaked towns of Pasadena, Glendale, Burbank and San Marino that he represents, Jim Rogan stopped by an elegant bar in Philadelphia, on the margin of last summer's Republican National Convention, for a fund-raiser that was unique, and uniquely circular: it was held for him by a business that has absorbed the lion's share of the money that has been raised for his campaign, in the course of raising that very money. The firm is the Lukens Cook Company, a direct-mail consultancy. ''Ever dollar is going to count,'' Walter Lukens told me.</p>
        <p>One of the most expensive things a campaign does is to raise money. It may cost untold amounts of the candidate's time and dignity, but it costs quantifiable amounts of hard cash. Typically, a campaign spends up to one of every five dollars in the pursuit of more. Rogan and Schiff have spent more than that, however, because they have relied on direct mail. They have done extensive national ''prospecting'' for donors. That means they have rented mailing lists from other candidates and companies for thousands of dollars and then sent out, say, a million appeals at an average cost of 45 cents to 60 cents each.</p>
        <p>This mail tends to go to the circle of donors that Emily's List calls ''Ax to Grind'' -- people who couldn't care less about little old ladies in Pasadena but who are generically furious at, alternatively, righties or lefties. Each candidate has trumpeted how much the bad guys are helping his opponent, thereby bringing in not only money for himself but also fresh bogeymen for that opponent. ''My opponent has received generous contributions from billionaire Hollywood movie moguls David Geffen and Steven Spielberg,'' read a plea from Rogan, mailed with a signed picture of him and Henry Hyde. A Schiff appeal signed by Norman Lear warned, ''Right-wing funders are planning to pour more than $2 million into Jim Rogan's campaign.''</p>
        <p>The cost of such direct mail is staggering. In 1999, Rogan spent at least $1.4 million, two-thirds of his total campaign expenses that year, on direct mail. To stay competitive, Schiff got into the act this year. In the first six months, he put more than $715,000 into direct mail, more than half his spending during the period.</p>
        <p>A candidate is lucky to break even on such a mass mailing. But those who do respond, Lukens said as we stood at the bar, will probably contribute again. They enjoy receiving updates on the campaign, together with the inevitable pledge envelope. ''It's like letters from camp,'' he said. To keep donors feeling generous, Rogan's appeals, like solicitations for aid for hungry children, are specific about what a contribution can buy. The letters assume an astonishing degree of literacy about political mechanics and acceptance of that literacy as part of American life. ''It costs us $133 to run two 30-second cable ads,'' read one Rogan letter. ''To reach minimum saturation on cable, we have to run 600 ads a week at a weekly cost of $40,000.''</p>
        <p>From his extensive direct-mail appeals, Rogan has ''acquired,'' as they say in the trade, a base of at least 50,000 donors. Schiff's base is closer to 30,000. These people will respond to plea after plea, often sending $30 to $50. Some will contribute till they hit the legal limit of $2,000 for the primary and general election.</p>
        <p>As long as it turns a profit, such fund-raising is worthwhile. A fund-raiser like Keelen or Lukens is the most obviously efficient campaign worker. As Keelen argues, a good fund-raiser should more than cover his month's wages with a day's work. That cannot be said for other consultants.</p>
        <p>In California these days, even candidates running to represent water districts hire consultants, to the amazement of old-timers like Joe Cerrell, a Los Angeles political consultant who is chairman emeritus of the American Association of Political Consultants. As campaigns become more costly, Cerrell said, candidates are willing to run fewer risks of shoddy work, and so they hire more consultants. That makes campaigns more costly still.</p>
        <p>Even by contemporary standards, the Rogan-Schiff matchup is something new, and Cerrell has taken to calling it ''the consultant full employment act.'' Besides his small campaign staff and apart from consultants hired for isolated tasks, Rogan employs a chief consultant, a media consultant, a pollster, a direct-mail house, a telemarketing firm, an accounting firm, a fund-raising consultant in California and Keelen.</p>
        <p>Schiff, who has raised and spent less, has a similar but smaller roster, including Erickson. But having one consultant in Washington can mean you need another. The Schiff team conceives of itself as running two campaigns. The second one, the ''D.C. campaign,'' is mostly about buzz and fund-raising -- about keeping the candidate's profile high enough and his chances rosy enough to guarantee PAC contributions and assistance from the national party. The two benefits are related, since the most important message the D.C. campaign can deliver is that the candidate is a top prospect of the national party. Erickson's office is just steps away from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>PAC directors demand detailed, inside information. So campaigns often hire pollsters based in Washington rather than in their districts. ''One of the things a PAC wants to know is who's on your team,'' Erickson explained. They are more impressed by names they know. ''If Mark Mellman or Fred Yang calls, 'O.K., we'll see what we can do,''' he said, referring to two Washington pollsters. ''But if someone from Northwestern University calls, you know, 'Who the hell are you?''' Unsurprisingly, Schiff has a respected Washington-based pollster, Diane Feldman, with a track record in California races.</p>
        <p>Campaign Ads: Who Cares?  Over whiskey and gin and above the roar of a bar, two old friends, two young politicos, were catching up on a Saturday night in Philadelphia as the Republican National Convention got under way. Since their days as lackeys together on the Dole campaign, one of them had found his way into the dazzling lights of a presidential campaign; the other was getting less exposure but more overall responsibility by following a different route, through House politics.</p>
        <p>''You try to say one clever thing and you offend every religious group!'' Todd Harris, John McCain's spokesman, volleyed over the din to Jason Roe, Rogan's brash campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Roe grinned. ''There are plenty of religious groups left to offend,'' he replied patiently. He had committed that particular gaffe weeks ago -- months, in campaign time -- and he could joke about it now.</p>
        <p>''That's right,'' snorted Harris. ''The Hare Krishnas.''</p>
        <p>For Harris, the campaign was winding down; for Roe, the toughest period lay ahead. The Rogan campaign was facing some tactical questions. The candidate was getting pounded with commercials paid for by the Democrats, and his own spots did not seem to be doing him much good. Like Rogan, Roe was disappointed that George W. Bush had not picked McCain, who remained popular in California, as his running mate. If he had, Roe thought, the race would be over.</p>
        <p>Roe is a compact man with a jet-black goatee and a sharp wit -- sometimes, like his candidates, too sharp. In his office, he keeps a poster of Richard Nixon, a picture of Anna Kournikova and tapes of his beloved Simpsons. He has posted a picture of his candidate in which the Judge -- as Roe likes to call Rogan -- is making bunny ears with his fingers behind Roe's head. Like Keelen, Roe is 30, and like Keelen, he grew up around politics -- his father was an executive director of the Michigan Republican Party -- and decided to make it his career.</p>
        <p>In California races, most big strategic decisions get made by a chief consultant, an old hand who works for several candidates. It is the campaign manager who devotes every waking hour to making the trains run on time. Schiff's campaign was also being managed by an itinerant, goateed pro, Osthelder, a 32-year-old Wisconsin operative who had worked on campaigns there, in Michigan and in Indiana.</p>
        <p>By the convention, Rogan had already spent an awful lot of money. After advertising before the primary early this spring, he began again in early May, at a clip of $40,000 a week; some of that money went to pay the commission of the consultant who purchased the ad time. The commercials were tough on Schiff but not always helpful to Rogan. Some commercials were just sloppy, featuring misspelled words.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, Roe was happy with what the advertising had accomplished. He had studied Parke Skelton, Schiff's general consultant, and knew he liked to hoard cash until a campaign's last days. Rogan's early advertising, as intended, had forced Schiff to spend money on commercials of his own. In other words, the Rogan campaign was spending some of the money it raised to force the opponent to spend some of the money he raised.</p>
        <p>The problem was that the commercials did not seem to be having much effect beyond that. The campaign finally yanked them and ''went dark'' for about three weeks in August, to the bafflement of the Schiff camp. As he weighed what to do, Rogan had to consider the incentives of his consultants. ''We have one guy who makes his money on TV and another guy who makes his money on mail, and of course they both think what they do is most important,'' Roe said.</p>
        <p>Roe was also starting to worry about the outside groups who were pouring money into the race. This year, all records are being broken by groups using hundreds of millions of dollars in largely unregulated money to wage ''issue advocacy'' campaigns that praise or trash candidates but stay within the elastic campaign finance laws by not calling outright for someone's election or defeat. This kind of flyby politicking terrifies candidates, who have no control over who will attack them when or for what. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been pounding Rogan for almost a month, and the American Federation of Labor had joined in. No Republican group had come to Rogan's rescue. ''For three or four weeks now, I've been having people tell me, 'I'm hearing this rumor; it's coming soon,''' Roe told me. ''I don't know if they're shining me on or not.'' They were. The National Republican Congressional Committee did not start advertising for Rogan, by attacking Schiff, until after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Yet Roe harbored doubts about the effectiveness of any of this advertising. For all the money raised for this race, no one could afford to buy broadcast television or much radio time in the Los Angeles media market. The advertising was relegated to cable television -- which almost a quarter of the voters in the district did not have, according to Rogan's polling. Others did not watch the channels like CNN where many of the commercials ran. Those who did watch the news channels tended to be political junkies, whose minds were already made up. There were so few undecided voters left in the district already that Roe saw the two campaigns as fighting over maybe 20,000 or 30,000 votes out of 10 times that many. A couple of weeks after the campaign went dark, when it convened two focus groups of a dozen voters, not a single one could remember a Rogan commercial.</p>
        <p>Everyone kept right on buying advertising time. It may be the need to spend that drives fund-raising in the first place, but once a campaign raises enough money, that relationship can be reversed. A few weeks later, when I asked Jim Nygren, Rogan's chief strategist, why the campaign began to advertise so early, he answered, ''Fundamentally, because we had the budget to do it.'' It was late August, and Nygren, who runs the direct-mail operation, had just hired a new adman. ''We have an enormous budget,'' he said, ''so we hired someone good.'' Nygren is a veteran of California politics, but he seemed dazed by the resources at his disposal. He returned to that subject repeatedly. ''We have a huge operation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Before I saw Nygren, I had paid a visit to Parke Skelton, Schiff's general consultant, in his cluttered office a block north of Hollywood and Vine. In keeping with his routine, Skelton greeted me by complaining that I was wasting his time. It was the week of the Democratic convention, and he had a stack of messages from news organizations like The Boston Globe and The Providence Journal-Bulletin. ''Don't their cities have their own politics?'' he asked. The good-natured grousing was intended to make a point: to Skelton and Schiff, press from outside the district was of little value at this late date, when the D.C. campaign was going well and the national donor network was established. Such coverage, like the convention itself, was a distraction.</p>
        <p>That kind of discipline is a hallmark of the Schiff campaign. Skelton, who creates the ''persuasion mail,'' produces the television commercials, spins the press and buys the television time, is earning a flat fee of $100,000 for 16 months' work on the race, one of several he is handling. He does not take commissions. ''If I tell a candidate that our tracking shows he needs to take another mortgage on his house to pay for a direct mail,'' Skelton said, ''I don't want him thinking, 'Parke's getting 15 percent of my mortgage.'''</p>
        <p>Skelton sees the campaign as a series of city-council races. Schiff spent less than $6,000 on advertising before the primary on March 7, all of it for Armenian-language cable channels to reach one swing minority group. The Armenian advertising had worked like a charm, Skelton said. But in general, he, like Nygren, prefers to rely on the mail. Each campaign pored over the voter registry, divvying up the population by party, by voting history and by ethnic surname. The Rogan campaign, for example, found 16,000 voters it believed were of Armenian origin by searching for names ending in ian or yan. Such households received customized messages, sometimes misleading ones, from each campaign. Those less costly letters, keyed to the diversity of the district, are likely to be more powerful than the one-size-fits-all advertisements. The Schiff campaign's internal polling in August found that fewer than one in three likely voters could even remember seeing a Schiff ad. The good news for Schiff was that the same poll found that Rogan's commercials seemed to be backfiring. ''I'm running out of ideas on how to spend the money we're raising,'' said Skelton, reflecting the same amazement as Nygren. ''I may start running Rogan's ads for him.''</p>
        <p>As we drove through the district one afternoon last month, Roe said that after direct mail, his most effective tool was not advertising but ''voter contact'' by volunteers or the candidate. That meant nothing to the consultants, he added. ''None of them are making money off it.''</p>
        <p>There is a suspicion about all this getting and spending that is shared by members of both campaign teams. It is that an arms race is under way in California's 27th Congressional District, one that preserves the political status quo even as it darkens the political environment. I raised that notion with Keelen, the fund-raiser, in late September. ''It would be interesting to see if they ran just on message and each was given a quarter of a million bucks,'' he replied. He paused for a moment, considering. ''It probably wouldn't be much different,'' he said at last. The reason is that, in here somewhere, there are actual candidates with opinions, and there are actual voters with opinions of their own.</p>
        <p>Is All Politics National?  It's been decades since a Democrat last left for Congress from the 27th Congressional District. To the mavens in Washington, the seat seemed safe for the Republicans. But then Congress took upon itself the task of determining whether President Clinton had dallied with an intern and lied about it. And James Rogan, member of the House Judiciary Committee, former judge and prosecutor, rose like a plump trout to the occasion, with his characteristic sense of history and his own place in it.</p>
        <p>This summer, a reunion of sorts took place in a judge's chambers inside the Pasadena Superior Courthouse, where Rogan once argued and decided cases. Half a dozen members of the House Judiciary Committee, former managers all, gathered to hold a hearing on methamphetamines and to lend support to the only manager whose seat was in danger. Here, in private, the men had the towel-snapping camaraderie of aging high-school jocks.</p>
        <p>''Chris, we're going to run you down to Hollywood, let you spout off to all the leftists,'' Rogan said.</p>
        <p>Chris Cannon looked up from the judge's desk, where he was signing a stack of the posters of the House impeachment team that Rogan likes to give donors. ''Why don't you send me somewhere where I can get you some votes?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Like the posters, the subject of impeachment was nowhere in evidence when the hearing started. ''This is a tribute to Jim Rogan,'' Asa Hutchinson said in opening it, ''the respect we have for him, and the problem of methamphetamines.''</p>
        <p>The hearing was also a tribute to the advantages of incumbency and to the shadowy role impeachment is playing in our politics. After scrambling the government and transfixing the news media, impeachment has become a nationally shared secret, the new race politics -- spoken of candidly in private but more often in code in public. Impeachment, per se, did not even come up during the candidates' first face-off, in mid-September. But it was impeachment that started the laughter when Rogan declared that he was proud of ''yes, at times, even working with a Democratic president.''</p>
        <p>Both sides have used the issue in their national fund-raising, and it has driven up the price tag of this seat. But each would prefer that the other bring it up in the district. ''People got so sick of the whole impeachment thing that the voters will punish whichever campaign puts it in front of their face,'' Skelton said. Schiff's campaign is afraid of making Rogan sympathetic, a principled martyr, by attacking him directly.</p>
        <p>Rogan hopes to salvage something by presenting himself as doing what's right, regardless of the politics. He even inserted the I-word into a commercial, couching it so that it sounded like a response to a Schiff attack. But he gave me much the same analysis as Skelton of impeachment's role. ''What my advisers want me to tell you and all of your brothers is that, 'Oh, that's not an issue,''' he said over lunch one day at a favorite spot, California Pizza Kitchen. The reality, he said, was that because of impeachment, some people would support him no matter what and others would vote against him just as passionately. ''And there's an awful lot of people on the other side,'' he added, jabbing his butter knife at me.</p>
        <p>With his severe features and odd, monkish cap of hair, Rogan projected an image during impeachment of a waspish inquisitor with the hubris to lecture even the august Senate on its duties. But the reality of Jim Rogan is more interesting, just as his political predicament is much too complex to be chalked up to impeachment.</p>
        <p>In an age of doggedly temperate politicians, there is something raw and reckless about Rogan, a onetime Democrat turned conservative Republican. The stories he tells are not anodyne; they tend to be about things like slugging a childhood friend when he caught him shooting up and about visiting his mother in a halfway house after she was jailed for welfare fraud.</p>
        <p>In Jim Rogan's company, you are apt to meet people like Jeff (Skunk) Baxter, the guitarist, who rushed up to embrace the congressman after Rogan sneaked me onto the floor of the Republican National Convention. Rogan wheeled Baxter around, arm over his shoulders, and introduced him as an expert on weaponry and a guitarist years ago for the Doobie Brothers. ''But most importantly,'' Rogan concluded, ''at the Palomino Club, where Jim Rogan was bartender, he was in the house band.'' Baxter described a party he recently played that involved ''a midget Elvis and a midget stripper.'' Rogan replied with a lengthy story from his Palomino days involving an immensely fat Elvis and a sweat-soaked rag.</p>
        <p>For all the rough and tumble of his childhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, Rogan, who is 43, described himself at various times as a bookish, chubby boy who was painfully shy, who took passionate refuge in following politics and collecting its tangible symbols. He is a nationally known collector of political memorabilia, like that stolen seal from the '68 convention. When he was about 12, Rogan waited outside a reception for Gov. Ronald Reagan. He talked Reagan into signing and handing over the eight note cards he had used for his speech. When Rogan needed money to help pay his law-school tuition, he reluctantly sold Cards 2 through 8 for $1,500. It was those cards, he explained to me eagerly, that enabled him to become a lawyer, and then a judge, and then a congressman, and then a member of the House Judiciary Committee weighing the impeachment of a president. Shortly before the impeachment vote in the House, he saw the cards in a memorabilia catalog, bought them and donated the lot to the Reagan Library. ''It's a great story, isn't it?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>As a politician, Rogan views himself as destined. But as a congressman, he is probably doomed, if not in this election then in the next, and it is local circumstances and not impeachment or even the high-tech witchery of a modern campaign that are weaving that fate. His own advisers say that when the state's Congressional seats are reapportioned next year, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature needs barely to tinker with the district's boundaries to give the Democrats a lock. Already, the electoral ground is shifting beneath Rogan's feet. ''It's staggering to me as a native to watch what's happened here,'' said Jim Hayes, the president of Political Data, a company that tracks California voters and is based in the district.</p>
        <p>Older white voters have died or moved away, and as is happening in suburbs across the country, immigrants have moved in -- Latinos, Filipinos, Chinese. The district has the biggest concentration of people of Armenian origin in the United States. Another change was evident when I drove with Hayes to pick up some data: we passed the propped-up facade of an Old West town, as Hayes reminisced about seeing Sela Ward walk past. Hayes uses the computers on the Warner Brothers lot. More Hollywood operations, like DreamWorks SKG, are locating offices in Burbank and Glendale, bringing Democratic union workers with them. These days, the district is 44 percent Democratic, 37 percent Republican.</p>
        <p>That change was under way the first two times Rogan ran. By this election cycle, the opportunity was too fat to miss, and Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, recruited the strongest candidate he could find, a Democrat who could have been cast on the Warner Brothers lot itself.</p>
        <p>Adam Schiff is the anti-Rogan. Like Rogan, Schiff is a devoted family man and a prosecutor-turned-politician, but that is about where the meaningful similarities end. Schiff was born in Framingham, Mass., near Boston, and educated at Stanford University and Harvard Law School. While Rogan is all unsanded edges, Schiff is placid and baby-faced and looks younger than his 40 years. His own advisers joke about his lack of charisma, but they marvel at what a dogged campaigner he is -- an animal,'' in the frequent tribute of one of his aides.</p>
        <p>Rogan is jumpy and combative; Schiff, relentlessly unobjectionable and cautious. Ask Rogan what members of Congress he admires, and he won't stop talking. Ask Schiff, and he will name just one, Sam Nunn, the centrist former senator from Georgia who left in 1996. Ask him for more examples, as I did, and he will name just one: Sam Nunn. Adam Schiff, like Bill Clinton, talks about ''challenges,'' not ''problems.'' He wears an American flag tie. He curbs his tires.</p>
        <p>While Rogan's voice is urgent, Schiff speaks in the sonorous tones of a man dispensing gardening tips on public radio. His manner is so mild that you hardly notice how smart and tough he can be. Rogan likes to talk about himself; Schiff talks about his constituents and gets excited when the subject is the possible curfew at the Burbank airport or the expansion of the 710 Freeway through South Pasadena, issues he has labored at as a state senator. It is not surprising to learn that he is for the curfew, against the expansion.</p>
        <p>Schiff fits an emerging mold of politician, post-Gingrich and even post-Clinton, a type whose traits are exemplified in turns by George W. Bush and Al Gore. When it comes to politics, they are sophisticated enough, like Bush, not to talk much about how sophisticated they are; they deliver the good news with a grin, the attacks almost as amiably and the bad news rarely, if at all. When it comes to policy, they are mechanics, like Gore, rather than architects; they present themselves as unglamorous, hard-working public servants, on contract for a job. At the Congressional level, their watchwords are bipartisanship and constituent service, and they mean both.</p>
        <p>In all his criticisms of Rogan, Schiff returns to the idea that he does not represent the district, in its beliefs or its needs. Schiff -- who is pro-choice but not pro-abortion, pro-gun-control but not anti-gun, pro-labor and also pro-business, deeply worried about health care and the schools and able to speak a little Armenian when the occasion demands -- is probably more in tune with more voters. Schiff repeatedly gave me the same definition of a congressman's role: ''This is fundamentally a service job,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rogan has a loftier conception, and he flashed some anger when I asked if a congressman should not be more careful to hew to his constituents' beliefs. ''If my job was merely limited to taking a poll of my constituents' views, that would not only go against the fundamental role of representative democracy; it could lead to tyranny,'' he said as we drove through Pasadena. ''I thought a lot about that going through impeachment. There are 700,000 people in this district, all with an opinion. There's only one of them that takes an oath to defend the Constitution. I didn't take an oath to represent the majority in my district.''</p>
        <p>But over the last several months, through campaign move and countermove, Rogan has found himself struggling to adapt his messages to most voters' concerns. Since the early attack advertising was not working, he tried changing his spots. His first positive commercial presented Rogan as a family man seeking prescription drug coverage for seniors, H.M.O. reform and a juvenile Brady Bill -- that is, it presented Jim Rogan as Adam Schiff. The self-styled maverick had been driven by polls to adopt the issues, if not the precise stands, that Bill Clinton and the Democrats championed.</p>
        <p>What Money Cannot Buy  In June, I happened to be across the country from Rogan's district, outside of Scranton, Pa., for a special election for a State Assembly seat. With redistricting approaching and control of the State Assembly teetering, both parties had poured money into the race. The candidates combined to spend more than $1.5 million dollars. The Democrat won with a total -- a grand total -- of 8,791 votes. He had the privilege of serving for eight days. That was all the time left in the legislative session. Then he returned home to campaign against the same Republican.</p>
        <p>Something crazy is happening in American politics. It is compounded of competitiveness, consultant specialization, a corrupted campaign-finance system, the maturation of polling and advertising technology and a surfeit of careless contributions in a booming economy.</p>
        <p>Yet no candidate, at least no candidate in a close race, can abandon the old ways and the accountability to constituents that they bring. Evidence of this can be found in the Sisyphean life of Jim Rogan. The permanent campaign, promulgated by Clinton at the presidential level, has long been a fact of life in marginal House districts. As Rogan told me once, there is no such thing as a noncampaign day.</p>
        <p>Rogan has never seen the fireworks in the capital on the Fourth of July, though he longs to. He has never gone scuba diving on some cushy foreign junket, like his colleagues in safe seats. The only overseas trip he has made in his life was to Armenia, for obvious reasons. ''Sometimes you feel like a hamster on a wheel,'' he said during one long day. He misses his wife and kids at home in Arlington on the lonely weekends he spends in his rented apartment in Burbank. The job, he said, was worth it. But not by much.</p>
        <p>That day included more than two hours of taping for campaign commercials at an Armenian school. But it also included the kind of events that keep a politician in touch. It started at 7:30 with a school district's citizen oversight committee meeting, followed by a fund-raiser with local telecommunications executives, a meeting with Burbank city-council members, the hearing on methamphetamines and, that evening, a brief sit-down at a restaurant with Philippine-American leaders, who were disappointed that Rogan did not stay for dinner. ''Is this my jacket?'' he muttered to himself, befuddled by the fit of his own clothes as, grizzled and pale, he stood to rush to the airport for a red-eye flight to Washington.</p>
        <p>Try as he might, Rogan cannot show up as often or stay as long as Schiff, who commutes daily to Sacramento. Schiff's State Senate district encompasses the Congressional district, and he is a familiar presence. ''I know, I met you before,'' said a woman in Burbank when Schiff knocked on her door to introduce himself early one evening this summer. ''When's our work going to pick up? Remember, you and I talked about that before.''</p>
        <p>''That's right,'' Schiff said, not entirely convincingly. ''Now I remember.'' In this tight race, no candidate or outside group wants to cut a corner, since that extra consultant or extra commercial may move just enough voters. But that same concern keeps Jim Rogan taking red-eye flights and Adam Schiff knocking on doors. That may be Schiff's chosen image, but he must do the work to cultivate it. ''I am determined,'' he said between houses, ''that if this is a close race, the extra thousand votes will be for me.'' As he distributed fliers, Schiff pointed out that his number was on the back. But he does not wait for his constituents to call him. He randomly calls them from his office in Sacramento, just to check in.</p>
        <p>The next day, after holding a three-and-a-half-hour public hearing in Glendale on youth violence, Schiff stopped in at a Chamber of Commerce reception in wealthy La Canada Flintridge. Then he was off, farther up into the hills as the sun set, to the Crescenta Valley Sheriff's Station. There, in a windowless room, about 30 people had gathered for the presentation of scholarships of $100 to kids going off to college. Rogan, who was in Washington, was represented by an aide. The local assemblyman was on vacation in Puerto Vallarta. Even two of the seven young scholars were no-shows. But Adam Schiff was there.</p>
        <p>''It's a pleasure to come and recognize young people,'' he said, meaning it. ''Thank you very much for inviting me.''</p>
        <p>All this explains why America does not elect visionaries from marginal House districts and why pork-barrel politics is alive and well. The old sins of politics endure alongside the modern ones, but so do the old virtues -- of attentiveness and responsiveness, of neighborliness. National groups and outside donors may be trying to influence the race, but the candidates are talking about local concerns and the local manifestations of national and even global ones: about blocking a proposed hilltop development in Glendale, about providing prescription drugs less expensively, about how Turks slaughtered Armenians during World War I.</p>
        <p>''Most people, regardless of what ethnic group they belong to, are just looking for someone to give them a little respect,'' Carlos Moorhead said when I visited him at his country club in Glendale. For 24 years, before he retired and Rogan was elected, Moorhead, a conservative Republican, represented the 27th district. He also served on the Judiciary Committee, and during his first term he also voted on a president's impeachment. He opposed Nixon's impeachment, taking a popular stand in the then-conservative district.</p>
        <p>Moorhead spoke like a relic of a gentler political era. A grandfatherly man with Popeye forearms and laugh lines crowding blue eyes, Moorhead refused to say an unkind word about Schiff, though he is squarely behind Rogan. He never practiced negative campaigning, he told me proudly, and he was not about to start. He tried to avoid commenting on the millions raised for this race, though he was clearly saddened by it. ''I'm not a good money raiser,'' he said. ''People would ask me, 'Do you really need the money?' And I'd say, 'No.'''</p>
        <p>Moorhead argued that, even today, money need not decide the race. ''People vote for folks they like,'' he said twice, simply.</p>
        <p>During my long talk with Moorhead, I found myself thinking back to the Fourth of July parade. That morning, a wave of chatter had paralleled the candidates' cars through the crowd: ''They're running for what?'' ''I think he's cute,'' ''He was all for impeachment, and now they're madder than hell at him.'' Some of the talk was directed right at the candidates. One woman demanded to know why he had not fought for seat belts in school buses since ''you promised me that three years ago!'' ''Let's go buddy,'' a man whose T-shirt advertised the Pasadena Academy of Self-Defense called out to his congressman, ''how 'bout no gun control?'' Rogan shot him his intense glare and replied that the government should start enforcing existing laws and locking criminals away. ''You've got my vote,'' the man replied.</p>
        <p>The truth is Susan Carpenter-McMillan had a point: weird hair matters. Candidates' quirks and local issues matter. Pikachu -- with his crack about it all coming down to fund-raising -- was missing the obvious, in a way that Moorhead, and now Rogan and Schiff, could never afford to. All the money and outside meddling was a story, but not the story. It is hard to envy the voters of California's 27th Congressional District the advertising that has bombarded them, like residents of swing states in the presidential race, for months. It is hard to envy them the political direct mail that will be stuffed into their mail slots at a rate of perhaps 20 pieces a day come November. But it is hard, in the end, not to envy them their choice, which for all the high-priced consulting and cynical strategizing remains firmly in their hands.</p>
