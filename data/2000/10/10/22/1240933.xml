        <p>Four months ago, at the height of the summer tourist season, Greyhound Lines resumed direct bus service to and from Downtown Brooklyn for the first time in 10 years.</p>
        <p>But community board members say that the service has created traffic snarls and pollution in an already congested part of town, and that they were not consulted about the location for the service, on Flatbush Avenue.</p>
        <p>Robert Evans, chairman of Community Board 2, said Greyhound representatives never formally presented their plan to the board.</p>
        <p>''They never made the appropriate petitions,'' he said. ''They just completely bypassed all processes and disrespected everybody who had legitimate concern or interest.''</p>
        <p>Ike Davis, Greyhound's area manager for New York City and Long Island, said company officials had met with community board officials but had not presented plans for the Flatbush site because they had only settled on that site after plans for one in another community board district fell through.</p>
        <p>The community board's role is only advisory. Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation, said the department had granted a permit for Greyhound to open at its current location, in front of a greeting card shop at 395 Flatbush Avenue near DeKalb Avenue.</p>
        <p>Tony Herbert, an assistant to Representative Edolphus Towns, who  has helped Greyhound with the Brooklyn negotiations, said that while Greyhound ''thought they were doing the right thing,'' the company should have talked more to community leaders.</p>
        <p>He said Greyhound representatives had met at Mr. Towns's office to discuss guidelines with Tony Ibelli, who heads the community board's landmarks committee.</p>
        <p>Four buses a day now operate at the Flatbush Avenue site. Mr. Davis said the company was seeking a new location.</p>
