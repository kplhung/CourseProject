        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of Joseph Dorman's ''Arguing the World'' (Books in Brief, Oct. 1), the book of his documentary film, Allen D. Boyer writes, ''It may seem ironic that former Trotskyists have made such eloquent neoconservatives.'' Only one former Trotskyist, Irving Kristol, became a neoconservative. The other former Trotskyist, Irving Howe, became a Socialist. Neither Nathan Glazer nor I was ever a Trotskyist. Nor has ''the group'' made a rightward tack.</p>
