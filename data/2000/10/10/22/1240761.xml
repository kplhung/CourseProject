        <p>A LEVELING of an uneven, outdated and flawed property assessment system that is widely conceded to favor the rich and penalize minorities began in Nassau County last week, with property assessors snapping pictures of homes in the Village of Hempstead.</p>
        <p>When the Herculean task of reassessing all of Nassau's 416,000 residential and commercial properties for the first time in 62 years is completed by 2003, the tax bills of many individual property owners will have shifted dramatically.</p>
        <p>County officials said property owners in areas including Great Neck, Port Washington, Manhasset and elsewhere on the North Shore, as well as in the Five Towns area on the South Shore, will almost certainly pay more when tax bills based on the new assessments arrive no later than 2004.</p>
        <p>Just as certainly, they said, residents of Roosevelt and New Cassel, where there are high percentages of minority homeowners, and certain middle-income areas that may include Levittown, Wantagh and Seaford, will pay less.</p>
        <p>But others said any predictions would be premature until all the values are computed. The new figures, based on full market value, will replace a system pegged to 1938 construction costs.</p>
        <p>''This is a modernization of the Nassau County assessment system, and equity and fairness demand it,'' said Charles O'Shea, the chairman of the county's Board of Assessors.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Shea said the reassessments would be handled by employees of an Ohio company that holds a $34 million contract. They will estimate full market values, and the county will then determine a uniform percentage of the market value that will serve as the assessed value.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Shea said reassessment teams, who will carry identification, would take digital pictures of the front and side of residential properties but intrude no further. ''This should not inconvenience anyone in Nassau County,'' he said. ''No one will have their door knocked on by employees of the reassessment company asking to come inside.''</p>
        <p>Property owners won't learn the results of the valuation until months later. ''For some people it is quite obviously going to be a painful change,'' said Frederick E. Parola, the county comptroller.</p>
        <p>Under terms of a court settlement of a suit against the county by six minority homeowners, the county formally approved the reassessment in late August and hired the Ohio company to carry it out. The suit, filed against Nassau in 1997, alleged the current system was biased.</p>
        <p>Frederick K. Brewington, a civil-rights lawyer in Hempstead, said that African-American residents he represented were suing in a separate case, seeking to recover damages for ''the clear pattern of discrimination'' in the system.</p>
        <p>''The current system obviously has been a unnecessary burden on those who could least afford it,'' he said. ''The beginning of the reassessment marks an important day in the history of the county and of those in the affected communities.''</p>
