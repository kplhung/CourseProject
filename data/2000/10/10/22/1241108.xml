        <p>In past years, they have been known to hurl batteries at opposing outfielders. Pummel the occasional Boston Red Sox fan. Pour beer on the poor soul foolish enough to root for that team from Queens.</p>
        <p>But as the World Series opened last night at Yankee Stadium, a game billed as a take-no-prisoners New York showdown featured a sea of Yankee fans in the bleachers who were hospitable to the handful of crosstown rivals who dared show their colors.</p>
        <p>In an electric atmosphere, friendly exchanges over how fans got the hottest ticket in town were more common than curses.</p>
        <p>Melissa Franzen, a Mets fan from Long Island, called Ticketmaster in Chicago and beat the rush in New York. Samir Bhavnani, a Yankees fan from San Diego, agreed to sell hot dogs for charity simply to be inside Yankee Stadium. And Christian Esposito Jr., a Mets fan from Staten Island, paid a ticket broker $800 for the chance to witness baseball history.</p>
        <p>Esposito, wearing a Yankees jersey, went to the game with his best friend, Joseph Rinaldi, a die-hard Mets fan.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter,'' Esposito said when asked to explain why he chose such a companion. ''We're rivals, but it should be fun. There shouldn't be any trouble. There shouldn't be anyone getting hit.''</p>
