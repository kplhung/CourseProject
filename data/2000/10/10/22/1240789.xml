        <p>Just south of Bear Mountain, Iona Island is closed except for a few times a year. Last week, a group from the Beczak Environmental Education Center in Yonkers was taken there by Erin Copeland, an Americorps volunteer who is developing interpretive plans for the 556-acre island, parts of which have been a wildlife refuge since the 1930's.</p>
        <p>The island was used as a vineyard in the mid-19th century before a hotel opened there. After the Spanish American War, a Naval armory was established, a few of whose buildings remain, below.</p>
