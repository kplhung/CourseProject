        <p>Mergers, like marriages, do not always result in happiness. No matter how ardent the courtship and how sunny the visions of the future, reality may prove a jolting journey into the unforeseen -- sometimes for better and sometimes for worse.</p>
        <p>''Some years back in New Jersey, when coeducation brought about mergers of formerly single-sex independent schools,'' writes L. B. Smith of Vineyard Haven, Mass., the faculty of a boys' school was surprised by the resignation of its highly regarded music director, who had decided to move to an institution that was still accepting only boys. ''A year later, I was surprised but delighted to see him back at the newly merged institution and said so.</p>
        <p>'' 'Oh,' he replied, 'I always intended to come back. I'm much too emotional a person to live through the first year of a merger.' ''</p>
        <p>''Several years ago, I was hired by the successor corporation to a merger of two financial institutions,'' writes Anne Wolfson of Manhattan. ''I was hired into a department in which there had been many merger-related layoffs and was supposed to assist people throughout the institution with matters related to regulations and also, incidentally, future mergers and acquisitions.</p>
        <p>''During the first six months on the new job, I was given almost no work to do. Apparently the turf wars had gotten so severe that people were threatened by the presence of an outsider, and work that should have gone to me went to expensive consultants'' or others.</p>
        <p>''Fortunately, I was able to figure out what was going on fairly quickly and found a new, much better job with a different employer.''</p>
        <p>''Synagogue names have strong emotional claims, and when shifting demographics necessitate closing or mergers, the loss of a name can produce feelings of sadness and grief,'' writes Rabbi Robert A. Alper of East Dorset, Vt. ''Which is why, apparently, heroic efforts are sometimes made to retain old names.''</p>
        <p>The rabbi, who is also a practitioner of stand-up comedy, says, ''I suspect that was the scenario behind this opening sentence appearing in the June 18, 1999, issue of The Baltimore Jewish Times:</p>
        <p>'' 'At a meeting June 10, the membership of Anshe Emunah-Aitz Chaim-Tifereth Israel voted to merge with Moses Montefiore Emunath Israel-Woodmoor Hebrew.' ''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Alper said: ''The two synagogues probably dwindled due to an exodus to the far suburbs. But another reason may be that their incomes were reduced when members suffered debilitating hand cramps while trying to write the names of these congregations on their donation checks.</p>
        <p>''My suggestion to the merged leadership: With all due respect to sentiment, be bold and courageous when selecting a new name. Don't opt for Anshe Emunah-Aitz Chaim Tifereth Israel-Moses Montefiore Emunath Israel-Woodmoor Hebrew. How about something like 'Temple Chai' ''?</p>
        <p>''In 1983, the company I was with was sold twice in one year,'' writes Mark Mehler of Kendall Park, N.J., who was its director of human resources. ''The last owners promised us all jobs and bright futures. Four weeks into the acquisition, all seven of us senior managers were terminated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehler went to a larger corporation. ''Went through a leveraged buyout and six presidents,'' he writes. ''The last one and I were like oil and vinegar.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehler was fired. ''Best thing that ever happened to me, as it forced me to analyze who I was and pushed me to be an entrepreneur in my field,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehler is now the co-author of CareerXroads, an annual directory to job, resume and career management Web sites and a trainer of human resource professionals in using the Internet for recruiting.</p>
        <p>''I would have never formed this business with my partner if I had stayed in corporate America as an employee,'' he says.</p>
        <p>''To the last president who fired me, I will be eternally grateful.''</p>
