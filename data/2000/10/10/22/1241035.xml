        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each sought to energize their core supporters today, with Mr. Gore reaching out to union members and black ministers and Mr. Bush telling Republican get-out-the vote meetings in Washington State that his opponent favors ''meddling, overbearing government.''</p>
        <p>As the campaign entered its final weeks, both sides also unveiled new advertisements, with Mr. Gore keeping up a media campaign against Mr. Bush on Social Security and Mr. Bush releasing two soft-toned spots focused on children and education.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign said that its new advertisements were part of an all-out fight for a number of swing states, including Ohio, where earlier reports had indicated that the vice president might be pulling out to devote his resources to more fertile territory.</p>
        <p>Gore officials said that they would double their spending on television advertisements to $4 million next week, and match the Republicans in television spending for the rest of the campaign. They said their commercials would amplify the idea that Mr. Bush was not ''up to the job'' of being president.</p>
        <p>This is a theme that Mr. Gore has been building on for months, laying the groundwork with assaults on Mr. Bush's record in Texas, his tax-cut proposal and his plan to privatize part of Social Security.</p>
        <p>He added to that today by questioning Mr. Bush's judgment in calling for the withdrawal of United States peacekeeping forces from the Balkans.</p>
        <p>The Bush camp, meanwhile, expanded its purchases of advertising time into two new states: Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee and Minnesota. Bush aides said today that they were so confident of winning Louisiana and Ohio that they would cut back on advertising there. And a buoyant Mr. Bush even predicted today, ''We have a solid chance to sweep the West Coast.''</p>
        <p>The election could well be the tightest in years, and the day's efforts reflected the recognition in each camp that the outcome in many hotly contested states could depend on which side does better in getting its supporters to the polls.</p>
        <p>In New Orleans this morning, Mr. Gore said he was not giving up on Louisiana despite polls that showed Mr. Bush with a lead. The vice president sought to ensure a solid turnout from black voters in the state, meeting with black ministers and saying, ''This election is not only about the economy, but it's about values.'' And he emphasized Social Security, arguing that keeping promises on issues like Social Security demonstrate the character of a campaign.</p>
        <p>Later, in Washington, D.C., Mr. Gore called on organized labor for help. ''I want you to campaign like we were one vote behind in every precinct,'' he told supporters from the 1.4-million-member Service Employees International Union in a get-out-the-vote rally. The event was linked by satellite to 17 similar events around the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made his own pitch in a speech by satellite from his Texas ranch to supporters in Spokane and  Seattle who were organizing a get-out-the-vote drive. Washington has voted for the Democrats in recent presidential elections, but the Bush campaign is fighting to win there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush sharply contrasted his agenda with Mr. Gore's. ''We are not just opposing the current administration,'' he said. ''We are proposing something better. For over a year we have been applying creative conservative ideas to the job of helping real people and that is the meaning of compassionate conservatism. And that is the message of my campaign. And that is a cause worth waging.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush most pointedly focused  on Mr. Gore's proposal for nearly $500 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, mostly targeted for specific needs like college education, child care or retirement savings.</p>
        <p>''You might call it an iffy tax scheme,'' Mr. Bush said. ''You can get a tax cut if you do everything Al Gore wants you to do. And that is the kind of meddling, overbearing government you're going to get if you vote for Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's phrase was a play on Mr. Gore's own charge that Mr. Bush's sweeping $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut was a ''risky scheme.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also fought back on the issue of Social Security, saying that Mr. Gore ignored the fiscal problems facing the retirement system when the baby-boom generation retires. ''Social Security has long-term financial problems,'' Mr. Bush said. ''His plan does nothing to address them.'' He argued that Mr. Gore's proposal to add a new retirement savings plan for the middle class on top of traditional Social Security would lead to ''Social Security plus massive government debt. Social Security plus a staggering tax increase.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats' advertising drive begins today with the latest commercials in a series that accuse Mr. Bush of promising the same $1 trillion in Social Security revenue to young adults to invest on their own and current retirees. The Bush campaign disputes that charge, but the Democrats are taking advantage of ambiguities caused by the fact that Mr. Bush has never presented a detailed plan but only overall principles for individual accounts.</p>
        <p>Tad Devine, a Gore strategist, said the campaign would use questions about Mr. Bush's Social Security plan to raise doubts about Mr. Bush's  qualifications to be president. ''There are some serious doubts about whether he is up to the job,'' Mr. Devine said, adding that Social Security ''focuses those doubts.''</p>
        <p>Separately, Michael Whouley, the chief political strategist for the Democratic National Committee, said the Democrats were going on the air next week in Louisiana with a particularly heavy purchase of advertising time in African-American markets.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign released two  30-second television advertisements of its own that were to run in 19 hotly contested states. Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said that the scope of the purchase represented an ''expanded battlefield'' and that for the first time Tennessee and Minnesota were being included as states Mr. Bush might win.</p>
        <p>Aimed at parents and women, the advertisements both showed Mr. Bush in an open necked green shirt, tie less and talking about child-rearing and education. Each is filled with color pictures of children of all races, at play or at school. Speaking of raising school standards, Mr. Bush says in one advertisement: ''It's easy to just spend more. Let's start by expecting more.''</p>
        <p>The second advertisement is focused on cultural values, and promises Internet filtering devices, character education in the schools and more effective drug prevention and school discipline. Mr. Bush says, ''I believe parents today need allies, not adversaries, to help raise moral, responsible children.''</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>GEORGE BUSH  Remarks by Gov. George W. Bush, speaking yesterday by satellite to Republicans in Washington State:</p>
        <p>''And there was an interesting moment in our third debate Tuesday night. Responding to a question from a woman in the audience, the vice president said he will reduce her taxes as long as she manages to fit into certain categories: if you do this you may get a tax break, if you do that you may get a tax break. He spoke to her for 94 seconds, and eight times he said the words 'if you.'</p>
        <p>You might call it an iffy tax scheme. You can get a tax cut if you do everything that Al Gore wants you to do. That is the kind of meddling, overbearing government you are going to get if you vote for Al Gore.''</p>
