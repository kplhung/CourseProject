        <p>A small sterling silver jewelry shop, Chimaera, opened on Oct. 12 at 117 East Seventh Street (between First Avenue and Avenue A). The store's free-form  jewelry is designed by the store's owner, Robin Morris. It is inspired by Ms. Morris's life experiences, she said, even though she lives in the hard-edged landscape of New York City. ''My jewelry is very organic, it's very asymmetrical,'' she said. One design used in both a ring ($65) and a bracelet ($220) is called Gate, and Ms. Morris said it was inspired by wrought iron gates she noticed in front of brownstones in the Village and the Upper West Side.</p>
