        <p>Oompa loompa doopity doo, I've got another riddle for you: Why is the 29-year-old movie ''Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' suddenly so popular all over town?</p>
        <p>The film has become a rental best seller on video store shelves from Astoria to the East Village to Park Slope, and was shown at the recent downtown Gen Art festival for urban hipsters. T-shirts featuring the movie's orange-faced, green-haired, singing moralists called Oompa Loompas are selling out, as are memorabilia available on eBay and other Internet collector sites.</p>
        <p>'It's picking up,'' said Javier Tapia, manager of West Coast Video in Astoria. ''Even the staff, they'll put it on.''</p>
        <p>The 1971 musical, based a novel by Roald Dahl, tells the story of a group of children who go on a tour of a candy factory owned by the eccentric Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder, and run by the Oompa Loompas. One by one, the children are knocked from the tour because of their bad habits: gluttony, obnoxious gum-chewing, television addiction.</p>
        <p>Varied explanations are offered for the film's new popularity. Some Wonka fans say original viewers are bringing it home for their children.</p>
        <p>Others say adults are watching, to indulge in childhood nostalgia. Still others say the movie has a dark, postmodern quality that is perfect for the current age. Like most things that endure, it offers something for everyone.</p>
        <p>''What 'Willy Wonka' is that not many films are is a film that appeals to children and appeals to a hip 20's and 30's generation, who see it as this post-psychedelic psychedelic movie,'' said John Vanko, whose Cowboy Booking International puts films into TriBeCa's Screening Room, where ''Wonka'' last month completed a six-month run.</p>
        <p>All this for a film that got a lukewarm reception when it first came out. ''It's stilted and frenetic, like Prussians at play,'' Pauline Kael wrote in The New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Perhaps in a city that has turned a former chocolate factory on Lafayette Street into million-dollar apartments, the film works now because it's reassuring to visit a time and place where chocolate factories contained chocolate, not to mention dancing Oompa Loompas.</p>
