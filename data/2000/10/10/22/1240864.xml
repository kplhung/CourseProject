        <p>Relax. Take a load off. It's cool; very cool.</p>
        <p>Outdoor benches are the latest decorating touch at boutiques and bistros in NoLIta and on the Lower East Side. Balthazar started it. Now, Ciao Bella, a gelateria on Mott Street, has a four-sided bench around a tree. Cafe Habana on Elizabeth Street has two benches, and so does Oliva (right), a restaurant at the hot intersection of Allen and East Houston Streets. ''The bench makes the neighborhood look better,'' John Perrotta, an owner of Ciao Bella, said. ''People come, they sit down -- people with strollers, with kids, with dogs.''</p>

        <p>Outdoor benches are the latest decorating touch at boutiques and bistros in NoLIta and on the Lower East Side. Balthazar started it. Now, Ciao Bella, a gelateria on Mott Street, has a four-sided bench around a tree.

        <p>The privately owned benches exist in a legal gray area; as long as no one complains, they're O.K., said Martha Danzinger, district manager of Community Board 3 downtown. Homeless people might once have made a home of a bench, but that is no longer a problem in the gentrifying district. The seats can be positively good for business.</p>
        <p>Sinead Corwin, an assistant manager at Calypso, a clothing shop on Mott Street, said, ''You can come shopping with your boyfriend -- they don't have to stand, so they're more patient.''</p>
