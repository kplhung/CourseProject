        <p>CUSTOMERS come from as far as Scotland and Japan or as close as around the corner. Over the last 20 years, the Record Exchange here has flourished while many neighborhood shops -- seemingly not much different --  have failed.</p>
        <p>The store, in a fraying white wood-shingled building on South Tulane Street about a block from the university, contains a collection of about 100,000 records and 50,000 CD's that range in value from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>Bright fluorescent lights streak across the ceiling of the shop; sturdy carpeting covers the floor to accommodate those who kneel for hours. A few posters are scattered on the white walls, but most of the space is taken up by the dozens of cardboard boxes filled with records and CD's on shelves that snake the length of the store, crawl along the walls and loop back around to the front.</p>
        <p>On most days, a group of regulars heads for the New Arrivals section hoping to spot a record that has eluded them. ''I've been coming here 15 years, maybe 16,'' said Kip Rosser, who said he was a fan of John Cage and early electronic music. ''I find things I've been searching for for years -- discs, LP's, stuff from really obscure labels.''</p>
        <p>The store's owner, Barry Weisfeld, said such searches were often the point. ''For a lot of people it's more action to buy the record than it is to listen to the record. Some of them are really compulsive; some of them are really obsessed.''</p>
        <p>But a few obsessed fans are not enough to keep a music store in business. Since the 1980's, a combination of growth by such national chains such as Sam Goody's and Tower Records, increasing costs and the  erosion of demand for recordings have forced many to shut down.</p>
        <p>''There just aren't any stores around anymore,'' said Mr. Weisfeld. ''If you opened up the Yellow Pages from 1980 you'd find a lot more stores than you would today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weisfeld says the Record Exchange had escaped the fate of other stores -- like New Brunswick Cheap Thrills, which was in business for 25 years before closing last year -- by adapting to CD's while maintaining its reputation as a record store.</p>
        <p>''The majority of people have no records anymore,'' Mr. Weisfeld said. ''Records are obsolete like dinosaurs to a majority of people.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Weisfeld said 70 percent of the store's sales of roughly $1 million last year came from CD's. And an increasing  number of people shop at the store for its budget CD's, used discs that cost $1.99 to $4.99.</p>
        <p>''It's a friendly store,'' said Alan Lesitsky, 52, of East Brunswick, who has shopped at the Record Exchange for nearly 20 years. ''People like myself among others will sometimes weed through their collection. I have not seen used classical CD's in any quantity anywhere else in New Jersey. I've looked around, checked phone books, stopped at stores I've driven by, and none of them have an extensive classical collection.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Weisfeld continues to think of the Record Exchange as a record store and insists he will stay committed to records. ''I have a personal feeling for records, but that's not why we carry them,'' he said. ''We carry them because we have an existing business. Why throw the market away? We have it, were established. CD's are the natural evolution, so why not sell both CD's and records?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weisfeld has been in the record business for 25 years. After graduating from college in 1975, he wandered through flea  markets and college towns buying and selling records. He would sleep in his car (and after his collection grew larger, his van) and set up shop on street corners.</p>
        <p>''It's not like the old days when there were a lot of good deals,'' said William Paquin, the main record buyer at the store for more than 16 years. ''A store like us can survive here and there. But a lot of the other stores  have basically closed up. When companies stopped making records, the good deals disappeared.''</p>
        <p>The Record Exchange advertises heavily to ensure that people continue to sell their  music collections to the store. The store sells records for two to four times what it pays for them. Occasionally, Mr. Weisfeld  will receive a tip about someone with a great collection who just passed away, or a government auction.</p>
        <p>But he mainly waits for people to see his advertisements and bring in records after some type of change in their lives. ''Deaths are good,'' Mr. Weisfled said. ''Deaths, divorces, relocations, one of those major changes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weisfeld once sent out letters to hundreds of estate lawyers explaining his business. He also sent out a mass mailing to libraries offering to buy their collections. But the lawyers didn't offer much, and the libraries offered a bunch of abused records.</p>
        <p>THE store has withstood the coming of CD's. Now it must face the Internet. Mark Baker, an avid record collector and the author of the book ''The Price Guide to Rock and Roll Memorabilia,'' said: ''The Internet becomes an alternative to find things you can't find. And as purchasers and consumers become more confident that they're protected on eBay about fraud, they feel more confident about ordering.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weisfeld acknowledges that the Internet has affected sales. But he says he is not very concerned. ''On the Internet you're looking at lists,'' he said. ''Some people like to look at lists. But some people like to look at covers, come in, feel them, touch them. You can't do that on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>''We've been here a long time,'' said Mr. Weisfeld. ''We'll adapt.''</p>
