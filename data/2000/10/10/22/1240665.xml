        <p>AS my wife, Carole, and I stood at the front desk of the Compass Point Beach Club, in Nassau in the Bahamas, we were fully prepared to make a New York City fuss. Jet-weary, baggage piled around us, we had just been told that our room would not be ready for several hours. So what if check-in time wasn't until 3 o'clock?  With only four nights of vacation ahead of us, every moment was precious.</p>
        <p>The friendly receptionist suggested lunch.  We weren't hungry. A swim? Our bathing suits were buried under carefully packed clothes. ''Have a look round and we'll see what we can do,'' said the hotel's elegant manager, Serena Williams, in a charming English accent. But we had come to chill out, not explore.</p>

        <p>AS my wife, Carole, and I stood at the front desk of the Compass Point Beach Club, in Nassau in the Bahamas, we were fully prepared to make a New York City fuss. Jet-weary, baggage piled around us, we had just been told that our room would not be ready for several hours. So what if check-in time wasn't until 3 o'clock?  With only four nights of vacation ahead of us, every moment was precious.</p>
        <p>The friendly receptionist suggested lunch.  We weren't hungry. A swim? Our bathing suits were buried under carefully packed clothes. ''Have a look round and we'll see what we can do,'' said the hotel's elegant manager, Serena Williams, in a charming English accent. But we had come to chill out, not explore.</p>
        <p>Anyway, the hotel hadn't made much of an impression. It clung perilously close to a twisty road just a few miles from the airport; space was so tight we had to park our rental car across the street. Reluctantly, we headed outside, certain that nothing short of unpacking in our own room would salvage the day.</p>
        <p>And then we saw the view, a breathtaking expanse of turquoise water and cloudless blue sky. To our left, hugging the shore, was a string of brightly painted cottages, several on stilts. A dining terrace was perfectly positioned to take it all in. Perhaps we were a bit hungry after all.</p>
        <p>Given the brevity of our vacation, unwinding quickly was paramount. We'd chosen Nassau, on New Providence island, because it's a direct three-hour flight from La Guardia Airport, a 30-minute cab ride from our Manhattan apartment. We'd heard that Compass Point was intimate, low-key and out of the ordinary.</p>
        <p>It was all of that. The resort is squeezed into one and a half narrow acres along the Atlantic Ocean, but the feeling is more cozy than claustrophobic. A single path runs from the small check-in area, past the pool and around the resort's 18 cottages and huts and 5 cabanas. These thatched-roof structures are kaleidoscopes of unlikely color combinations: yellows, pinks, turquoises and reds, to name a few.</p>
        <p>If it all sounds a bit garish -- well, it is garish. But it works. Compass Point has a funky, ''Why not?'' look that reflects the spirit of the resort. If a child were asked to design a hotel -- a very talented child with a taste for adult luxuries -- the result might well look like Compass Point.</p>
        <p>Actually, a great deal of adult talent went into designing the resort. The airiest accommodations are the free-standing cottages, spacious wood structures built on stilts, with a bedroom and bath on the second floor and an outdoor kitchenette and dining area below. The architect Alberto Lensi designed the cottages as octagons to catch the wind from all directions. Good idea, because there is no air-conditioning (except in the five poolside cabanas), only large louvered windows with fixed slats but no glass. Though the daytime temperatures during our stay in late May were well into the 90's, our cottage was always breezy and cool.</p>
        <p>Credit for the flamboyant color scheme goes to Barbara Hulanicki.  In the 1960's she helped launch the Mod look from Biba, the ultra-hip clothes emporium in London. Her inspiration for Compass Point was the island's annual carnival, Junkanoo, which is held in downtown Nassau in December. If Compass Point is any indication, Junkanoo is something.</p>
        <p>Our cottage, when we finally got into it at 3 p.m., was furnished with polished wood pieces and colorful batik fabrics. It had a ceiling fan, minibar, safe, cable TV, CD player and two fluffy bathrobes. The bathroom was a bit cramped, but then luxury in the traditional sense didn't seem to be what the place was all about. There was something genuinely tropical about our room, which was a nice change from the stale, convention-hotel flavor you find even in some deluxe Caribbean resorts.</p>
        <p>We spent a lot of time on our private balcony, perched so close to the water we felt we were floating on a bamboo raft. Each morning, as we sipped coffee we'd made in our outdoor kitchen, a stingray drifted lazily below us in the warm, shallow water.</p>
        <p>The beach at Compass Point is a very small, sandy crescent that all but disappears at high tide, so we spent most of our time around the pool, which sits above it. A pool attendant provided snorkeling gear and pointed to a reef about 50 yards from shore. The reef was easier to spot from land; we swam around for  a good half-hour looking for it, gazing through fogged masks at the pristine sandy bottom 10 feet below. When we did find the reef we were treated to a colorful variety of fish and coral, though the most startling sight was the resort itself as glimpsed from the water, more colorful than any reef  I've ever encountered.</p>
        <p>Though the hotel will arrange for a variety of activities off site, including sailing, scuba, aerobics classes and golf, there's not much to do at Compass Point other than relax beside the heated pool with its expansive views, taking occasional breaks for a swim or meal. (There's a tennis court, but it was damaged by Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 and hadn't yet been restored.)</p>
        <p>Occasional noise from low-flying planes approaching the nearby airport proved the only unpleasant distraction. Reading by the pool was activity enough for us, serenaded by music from small speakers hidden in the ground foliage. Normally, I detest ambient music, but this was actually very pleasant, and that has everything to do with Compass Point's owner, Chris Blackwell.</p>
        <p>Chris Blackwell, an Englishman born in Jamaica, began selling recordings of his favorite artists from the back of his car to London's West Indian community. He started Island Records in 1959, and one of his discoveries was Bob Marley, whom Mr. Blackwell signed in 1973. He sold  Island Records to Polygram in 1989 for a reported $300 million, and used some of the proceeds to create Island Outpost, a chain of boutique hotels and resorts in Miami and Jamaica, as well as the Bahamas.</p>
        <p>Compass Point has the look and feel you'd expect of a resort developed by a music entrepreneur; in fact, the main building, which houses the reception area and restaurant, was once Mr. Blackwell's home. The place is cool and laid back, and there's an almost obsessive attention paid to music. A casual inquiry to Ms. Williams about a song I heard poolside produced a five-page ''Jukebox Database,'' which listed tracks by artists from the Caribbean, South America and Africa. Guest rooms include an eclectic selection of CD's.  Across the street from the hotel is a fully equipped recording studio that had been used in recent months by  the groups Pink Floyd and Hanson, whose members stayed at the resort.</p>
        <p>For all its rock-star pedigree, Compass Point never felt intimidatingly hip. The staff was uniformly friendly in a casual way. Guests were mostly young couples; kids aren't prohibited, but our 10- and 8-year-old would have been bored silly in no time.</p>
        <p>Even Carole and I felt the need to break out after a few indolent days. There's nowhere to walk, so we took an inflatable pool raft and floated a short distance to a neighboring beach, where we strolled along the shore for a peaceful half-mile or so.</p>
        <p>The restaurant at Compass Point has a small indoor area besides the large terrace. The chef, Stephen Bastian, is a Bahamian who was formerly sous-chef at Jumby Bay in Antigua. His menu combines local ingredients and recipes with traditional resort fare; dinner entrees ranged from $19 to $30. Bahamian conch  finds its way into a tasty chowder, a sushi roll with an excellent jicama-pineapple coleslaw, and a salad. Local grouper appears in fried ''fingers'' on the bar menu and roasted with a Creole sauce at dinner. Thin-crust pizzas at lunch were excellent.</p>
        <p>One night we ventured into the city of Nassau, about a 20-minute drive from Compass Point, to try out Cafe Matisse, an upscale restaurant in a  Bahamian house that is about 115 years old in the heart of the city's historic district As a bonus, we enjoyed a nighttime walk around Nassau when, free of cruise ship passengers and car traffic, it exudes a colonial, romantic charm.</p>
        <p>Another night we drove to the huge Atlantis resort and casino on Paradise Island, accessible from Nassau via a toll bridge. It is a splashy, sprawling slice of Las Vegas on the sea; all of Compass Point could probably fit inside its mammoth casino.  We ate at the Seagrapes restaurant, which offers an enormous buffet of generally well-prepared food, then strolled through the resort's marine park, a series of man-made lagoons and giant fish tanks. Though undeniably impressive, it was not nearly as exhilarating as floating above our small reef at Compass Point, lulled by the sound of our own breathing as small schools of neon-colored fish passed by.</p>

        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>Delta Air Lines offers daily nonstop service from La Guardia to Nassau. Total flight time: 3 hours 10 minutes. A 21-day advance purchase round-trip fare for travel Monday to Thursday is $375; Friday to Sunday, $416. US Airways, T.W.A. and Continental either currently have nonstops from New York airports or plan to start them next month.</p>
        <p>Compass Point</p>
        <p>Because Compass Point occupies less than two narrow acres, all guest rooms have views of the Atlantic Ocean and are within steps of the pool and beach. The most luxurious accommodations are the two-story cottages, each with a small outdoor kitchen and dining area. A one-bedroom seafront cottage is $280 through Dec. 14, $355 from Dec. 15 to  April 15. A two-bedroom seaview cottage is $330, and $425 after Dec. 14.</p>
        <p>The free-standing huts are also appealing. A one-bedroom seafront hut is $255, $315 after Dec. 14.; seaview studio cabanas, which face the pool, are $200, $215 after Dec. 14. Reservations can be made through Island Outpost, (800) 688-7678, or by calling the hotel directly at (242) 327-4500.</p>
        <p>Dining</p>
        <p>The Compass Point restaurant offers very good food in a spectacular oceanside setting. Reservations are recommended, particularly on Saturday night, when the terrace fills up; call (242) 327-4500. Local specialties include lobster tail, conch prepared in a variety of dishes and red snapper. Appetizers are $6 to $12; entrees, $19 to $30. An appealing bar menu features an excellent cheeseburger ($10.75) and a combo platter with grouper fingers, shrimp, chicken wings and vegetables ($22).</p>
        <p>Cafe Matisse, on Bank Lane in downtown Nassau, (242) 356-7012,  was bustling with tourists as well as local business people. The courtyard terrace is charming. The calamari appetizer, served with homemade chili jam, was excellent. We also liked the rack of lamb and the grilled seafood platter. Dinner for two, with appetizers, main courses, and one drink each, was $105, with tip.</p>
        <p>The Atlantis Paradise Island Resort offers nearly as many dining options as a small city, several of them overlooking the enormous fish tanks.  We chose the all-you-can-eat Seagrapes buffet where the food was generally well prepared, particularly the stir-fries and other cooked-to-order dishes. It's among the least expensive restaurants in the resort but hardly a bargain at $31 at dinner, $15.50 for a child, some beverages not included; (242) 363-3000.</p>
