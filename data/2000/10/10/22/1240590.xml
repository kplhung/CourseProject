        <p>A promiscuous teenager is murdered in Lisbon. A grim police inspector opens the investigation. Suddenly, time slips its moorings in Robert Wilson's intelligent, unsettling thriller A SMALL DEATH IN LISBON (Harcourt, $25), winner of the 1999 Golden Dagger Award in England, wrenching the story from modern-day Portugal into a world at war in 1941. In this hellish place, the Germans are installed at the Hotel Parque, the British legation is next door at the Hotel Palcio, and the streets are swarming with war profiteers and refugees desperate to book passage on one of the packed ocean liners moored at the docks.</p>
        <p>The perspective on this chaotic and brutal world is supplied by Klaus Felsen, a Berlin factory owner who is conscripted by the SS and sent to Portugal to export huge quantities of a metal alloy needed to manufacture munitions. ''Everybody's a spy in Lisbon,'' Felsen soon learns, which may or may not include the opportunistic mountain peasant who becomes his partner in a furtive and dangerous job that leads to smuggling, bribery and coldblooded murder. As Felsen sinks deeper into personal corruption, the seeds are sown for the latter-day crime that now seems as inevitable as some mythic tragedy.

        <p>A promiscuous teenager is murdered in Lisbon. A grim police inspector opens the investigation. Suddenly, time slips its moorings in Robert Wilson's intelligent, unsettling thriller A SMALL DEATH IN LISBON (Harcourt, $25), winner of the 1999 Golden Dagger Award in England, wrenching the story from modern-day Portugal into a world at war in 1941. In this hellish place, the Germans are installed at the Hotel Parque, the British legation is next door at the Hotel Palcio, and the streets are swarming with war profiteers and refugees desperate to book passage on one of the packed ocean liners moored at the docks.</p>
        <p>The perspective on this chaotic and brutal world is supplied by Klaus Felsen, a Berlin factory owner who is conscripted by the SS and sent to Portugal to export huge quantities of a metal alloy needed to manufacture munitions. ''Everybody's a spy in Lisbon,'' Felsen soon learns, which may or may not include the opportunistic mountain peasant who becomes his partner in a furtive and dangerous job that leads to smuggling, bribery and coldblooded murder. As Felsen sinks deeper into personal corruption, the seeds are sown for the latter-day crime that now seems as inevitable as some mythic tragedy. Long before the final connections are made, Wilson's masterly work shows us the devastating -- and ineradicable -- effects of war on the human soul and the national psyche.</p>
        <p>No mind is safe when Ruth Rendell writes as Barbara Vine, the pseudonym she adopts when dissecting disturbed characters like 19-year-old Clodagh Brown, the narrator of GRASSHOPPER (Harmony, $25). The story opens with Clodagh being packed off to school in London after a macabre accident that claimed the life of a boy who got caught up in her passion for climbing electrical pylons. Pathos clings to the girl, who is not only traumatized by the accident and numbed by her loveless home life but tormented by claustrophobia that flares up when family friends install her in their basement flat. ''The claustrophobic's worst experiences are those where the fear has no name and no definition,'' Clodagh says, in a voice that echoes loudly in this airless environment of psychological suspense. ''It's a dread of some unidentifiable nemesis.''</p>
        <p>So intimately does Vine inhabit Clodagh's mind, she still seems like a fairly normal kid -- until she starts walking on rooftops at night. (''The more ornamentation on a roof the better, the more gables, belvederes, single chimney stacks and mansarding, the easier it is to climb.'') Given the company she keeps -- a band of alienated young people who cling to one another like the lost children in ''Peter Pan'' -- it's no surprise when Clodagh's passion for heights brings her down to earth. The real surprise is that the author spares her from the disaster she seems fated for.</p>
        <p>The revelation that Charles Todd's mother, Caroline, collaborated in the writing of his three previous novels raises provocative questions about LEGACY OF THE DEAD (Bantam, $24.95), which takes Todd's shellshocked Scotland Yard inspector, Ian Rutledge, farther along the redemptive path he's been treading since he returned to England, ''a murderer standing in judgment of murderers,'' from the battlefields of France in World War I. Does Rutledge owe the bedrock of his character, his insight and compassion, to the son? Is the mother responsible for the hellish scenes of the 1916 Somme offensive? And which of them, mindful that memory is the price of survival, burdened their broken hero with a conscience that speaks in the voice of the countryman he killed?</p>
        <p>Sharper than Rutledge's guilt over executing an insubordinate Scotsman named Hamish MacLeod is his fear of someday meeting the soldier's fiancee, Fiona MacDonald. But when he ventures into Scotland in search of a wayward member of the English aristocracy, he comes face to face with Fiona, who has been charged with murdering the noblewoman and stealing her child. Whichever Todd did what, Rutledge is eloquent in his priestly office, and the portraits of wives and parents grieving for their lost boys contribute a severe grace to this study of postwar Scotland as a land rich in beauty but barren of new life.</p>
        <p>Leslie Glass gets one thing right in TRACKING TIME (Dutton, $23.95): parents and their adolescent offspring do not speak the same language -- if, indeed, they speak at all. The smug, successful Manhattan breeders in this cautionary tale haven't a clue that their teenagers are skipping school to play at homicide. You can tell, because they say things like ''You're a wonderful, bright, brave boy, and you deserve all the good things life has to offer,'' and because the kids say things like ''Uh-huh.'' The problem is that April Woo, who has just made sergeant in the Police Department, has no lock on maturity either. Although she is on a time-sensitive manhunt for a missing psychiatrist, she's easily distracted by taunts from her boss, sweet talk from her boyfriend and the abuse she gets from the mother she calls ''Skinny Dragon Mother'' (and who calls her ''worm daughter'' in retaliation). The childish behavior isn't attractive, but at least this parent and child speak the same language.</p>
        <p>If Lucas Davenport is John Sandford's superhero alter ego, then Kidd -- some kind of aging jock-nerd-engineer-fisherman-artist'' from two previous thrillers -- must be the author's adolescent id. The well-staged murder of a friend and fellow hacker brings this criminally inclined computer genius out of retirement in THE DEVIL'S CODE (Putnam, $25.95) for some high-tech fun and games involving a computer chip that can break any encrypted code and featuring a master criminal who reads Orwell's ''Homage to Catalonia'' while fingering a diamond necklace as worry beads. The cool concept of this espionage caper is done in by the animatronic characters, who have the jerky moves of computer game figures. But before the whole system crashes, Sandford racks up points for Kidd's sophisticated hacking skills and for capturing the sophomoric humor of paranoid computer geeks who probably wear their Lone Gunmen T-shirts to bed.</p>
