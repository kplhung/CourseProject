        <p>IN just two weeks this month, as investors worried whether the violence in the Middle East would escalate into war, the stock market in Israel fell 16 percent. In Egypt, the market dropped 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The volatility of the region also affected many American investors, a great percentage of whom buy their stocks through mutual funds.</p>
        <p>But for them, the impact was indirect, because few funds contain shares of Middle Eastern companies. What hurt them were the global reverberations of the conflict. And that boiled down to one word: oil.</p>
        <p>Wall Street and other global markets were concerned that the violence would translate into higher prices for oil -- which it did, briefly -- and that those prices could lead to inflation and higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>That thinking played a big role in the 379-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 93-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index on Oct. 12 -- the day that a Palestinian mob mauled two Israeli soldiers, Israel retaliated with rocket attacks and terrorists blew a hole in a United States warship in Yemen.</p>
        <p>Last week, Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to the terms of a cease-fire after clashes in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>''For American investors, the oil effect was much more significant than the direct effect on Middle East companies,'' said Grace Pineda, who manages the $132 million Developing Capital Markets fund for Merrill Lynch. The fund has about 5 percent of its money in Israel and about 0.5 percent in Egypt.</p>
        <p>From late September, when the latest trouble erupted in the Middle East, through last week, the broad markets and several categories of mutual funds lost ground in the United States. In the most violent period, Oct. 5 through 12, equity income funds were down 4.80 percent, according to Lipper Inc. Growth funds were off 7.79 percent, and growth-and-income funds 6.12 percent.</p>
        <p>Those funds generally do not contain shares of Middle Eastern companies, yet the trouble in the region was among several factors -- along with a general sell-off in technology and telecommunications stocks -- that brought down prices.</p>
        <p>Emerging-markets funds declined 7.17 percent over that period. Although many of those funds invest in Middle Eastern companies, the ripple effect of the threat to oil affected them most, analysts and fund managers said. And those funds' investments in the region are still relatively small, usually less than 10 percent of the portfolios.</p>
        <p>''Most of the markets in the Middle East are insignificant in terms of the amount of capital invested in them from the United States,'' said Mark Madden, manager of the $250 million Pioneer Emerging Markets fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madden invests mainly in Mexico, Brazil and Korea. About 5 percent of his portfolio is in Israel and less than 1 percent is in Egypt.</p>
        <p>EXCEPT during such tense times in the Middle East, analysts and fund managers said, fluctuations in the United States markets, the biggest and most dynamic in the world, are more likely to influence share prices in the Middle East than vice versa.</p>
        <p>''The first thing overseas traders want to know when they come in in the morning is, 'What did the Nasdaq and the Dow do?' '' said Howard Klein, an institutional broker specializing in emerging markets at SG Cowen Securities in New York.</p>
        <p>Traders in Israel in particular have their eyes on the Nasdaq. Their country is also home to global technology, telecommunications and pharmaceutical companies, which depend on economic currents in the United States and Europe much more than on developments in the Middle East. Shares of many Israeli companies are sold as American depository receipts on the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>Only a handful of small funds concentrate on the Middle East. One of them, the $25 million American Israel Index mutual fund, is made up exclusively of Israeli companies, 16 traded on the Tel Aviv exchange and 19 on the Nasdaq. Like more broadly based mutual funds, its shares fell during the recent turmoil. But the fund's investors have remained confident. In the last few weeks, money flowing into the fund has far exceeded redemptions.</p>
