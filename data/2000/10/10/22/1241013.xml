        <p>Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, sank into a plush red wing chair in his office antechamber today and said, ''I could easily do this job for many more years and be very satisfied.''</p>
        <p>It is the kind of declaration that leaves his state Democratic colleagues biting their fists.</p>
        <p>Here is a man, such Democrats often grumble, who has the resume, brains and savvy to be so much more that just Connecticut's top prosecutor. A man, they say, who, but for his own reluctance to take on John G. Rowland in 1994, could  be cruising through his second term as governor. A man who, but for a disapproving Republican Congress, was almost nominated by President Clinton for a federal judgeship in May.</p>
        <p>And a man who, but for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's desire to run for re-election and for vice president this November, could be well on his way to the United States Senate as Mr. Lieberman's replacement.</p>
        <p>There is the feeling that, whether by personal design or political coincidence, Mr. Blumenthal, 54, a popular, telegenic politician with a fondness for news cameras, has yet to exploit his own star power for the glory of the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal can hardly be faulted for his failure to reach the Senate or the federal bench. But as Democrats begin planning for 2002, when Mr. Rowland, a Republican, may or may not run for a third term, Mr. Blumenthal, to his party's chagrin, has done little to promote himself as a top contender.</p>
        <p>''I think his only danger in this is that at some point people are going to say it's time to pull the trigger,'' Kevin B. Sullivan, a fellow Democrat who is president pro tem of Connecticut's State Senate, said of Mr. Blumenthal. ''There are only so many opportunities to go around.''</p>
        <p>But the attorney general, now halfway through his third term, is a patient man - perhaps he feels he has to be since he keeps almost getting offers for jobs he admittedly covets. Speculation that his career is behind schedule does not appear to bother him.</p>
        <p>''That kind of talk will disappear once there is an election,'' he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Taking on Mr. Rowland, he said, ''would not have been the right thing for my family.'' And if he had to choose between being a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and a United States senator, Mr. Blumenthal said he would lean toward being a senator, which he called ''the pinnacle of elective office for me.''</p>
        <p>How close Mr. Blumenthal came to reaching that pinnacle this year only Mr. Lieberman, whom Mr. Blumenthal calls a mentor and a ''good and loyal friend,'' knows for sure. For if Mr. Lieberman had caved to pressure from the public and from his own party to end his Senate bid and focus only on being Al Gore's running mate, Mr. Blumenthal would have been his most likely replacement.</p>
        <p>A recent University of Connecticut poll showed Mr. Blumenthal easily crushing the current Republican Senate contender, Philip A. Giordano, mayor of Waterbury, by a 31-point margin.</p>
        <p>Officially, Mr. Lieberman has until 5 p.m. on Oct. 27 to pull out of the Senate race. But with the presidential election too close to call, and Connecticut's absentee ballots already in the hands of its absentee voters, Mr. Lieberman is in the Senate race for good, his spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Though on political hold while he waits for the next great job opportunity, Mr. Blumenthal, a magna cum laude Harvard graduate and  former marine who in 1977, at 31, became the youngest United States attorney, has kept a vigorous pace in his current office.</p>
        <p>In the past four weeks, for instance, he has testified before the Securities and Exchange Commission in favor of limits on accounting firms' ability to offer other consulting services; argued to the Connecticut Supreme Court that warning labels on cigarette packs should be highlighted in bright orange;  began an investigation into how Priceline.com promotes its airline ticket sales; met with state regulators to urge rejection of a proposed utility merger; and issued a 95-page report documenting the failings of the state sheriffs system.</p>
        <p>''He, in his office, has probably used it better than any of the other statewide officeholders in terms of attracting attention,'' said Ken Dautrich, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut and director of the school's Center for Survey Research and Analysis. ''If ever there was a time for him to go for something, this is it.''</p>
        <p>But Professor Dautrich also noted Mr. Blumenthal's hesitance to put his reputation on the line against a tough opponent. ''He doesn't seem to be a tremendous risk taker,'' he said. ''He doesn't want to be in a close political race.''</p>
        <p>That sentiment has so annoyed some state Democrats that when it became clear Mr. Lieberman would not hand Mr. Blumenthal his Senate candidacy this year, they quietly applauded.</p>
        <p>''They'd like to make him work a little bit, sweat a little bit for once, actually make him run a campaign for one of these offices,'' said one Democrat who served with Mr. Blumenthal in the General Assembly, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''He always wants to be in a position where he doesn't have to make a tough decision.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer E. Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the Cook Political Report, said Mr. Blumenthal still has two more years -- no more -- to make his political move, reach higher office and fulfill his party's hopes for him.</p>
        <p>''What he would do to permanently wound himself is not run in 2002,'' Ms. Duffy said. ''To take a very easy appointment but not run against Nancy Johnson'' - a Republican whom Governor Rowland may appoint to replace Mr. Lieberman if the Democrats win the presidential race -- ''or another experienced Republican, that would hurt him.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Blumenthal promised, ''I'll be on the ballot for 2002,'' though he would not say which one.</p>
        <p>''If there is a race or contest that is worth doing because the job is worth doing,'' he went on, ''I would do it.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the political prospects of Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, characterized his job incorrectly. He is the state's top lawyer, not a prosecutor.</p>
