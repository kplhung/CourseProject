        <p>IN early September when the school year began, none of the fourth graders in Meryl Rosen blum's class at Saddle Rock Elementary School in Great Neck could define the word empathy. But since graduating from the bully-prevention program, they know all about empathy, sympathizing with hurt feelings and putting themselves in someone else's shoes.</p>
        <p>''If I saw someone sitting alone at lunch, I would say, 'Hey, want to eat with me?' '' said Eric Shyu, 9.</p>

        <p>IN early September when the school year began, none of the fourth graders in Meryl Rosen blum's class at Saddle Rock Elementary School in Great Neck could define the word empathy. But since graduating from the bully-prevention program, they know all about empathy, sympathizing with hurt feelings and putting themselves in someone else's shoes.</p>
        <p>''If I saw someone sitting alone at lunch, I would say, 'Hey, want to eat with me?' '' said Eric Shyu, 9.</p>
        <p>A key part of the program is its emphasis on what it feels like to be left out and how it feels like to be bullied, emotions close to just abut every fourth grader's heart. And although the students could identify with those feelings, very few knew what to do about them.</p>
        <p>Teachers, school aides and administrators are often just as powerless, said Patricia Cathers, the director of programs and volunteer services at Child Abuse Prevention Services in Roslyn, a nonprofit private agency supported by donations, grants and government appropriations. The agency, founded in 1982 and known by the acronym CAPS, started the bully-prevention program in 1997.</p>
        <p>''We believe that in every classroom there are between two and three children who spend their day in fear,'' said Ms. Cathers, one of the agency's two social workers.</p>
        <p>The bully-prevention program is presented free to fourth and fifth graders throughout Long Island in three 40-minute workshops led by volunteers.</p>
        <p>''It focuses not so much on the bullies or their victims, but rather the 80 percent in the middle,'' said Alane Fagin, the executive director of CAPS. ''They are the silent majority. They watch the bullying in action. We try to take that 80 percent and turn them from a silent majority into a caring one. Then we see what happens to the power of the bully.''</p>
        <p>The program encourages children to protect or stand up for one another through small, safe acts of moral courage. ''If you see someone being bullied, call out to them, escort them away,'' Nancy Greulich, who ran the Saddle Rock program, told Ms. Rosenblum's class. Social workers say that many children have never considered that by speaking out against bullying, or resisting the peer pressure to participate in it, they can short-circuit the process or lessen its effects.</p>
        <p>And as an ongoing reminder of that power, Ms. Greulich presented  Ms. Rosenblum's class with a ''Caught You Caring'' poster. The poster shows a cartoon of two mice, one beating up the other, with a red line drawn across it. Underneath the illustration are three columns in which the students could record who saw a caring act, who performed it and what was done.</p>
        <p>''Imagine how happy your parents will be when they come to school and see your name on this chart as having been a good person,'' Ms. Greulich told the class.</p>
        <p>Jesus Modesto, 9, had a ready response: ''If my mom sees that, she'll probably buy me a motorcycle.''.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenblum conceded that three 40-minute sessions can go only so far in preventing bullying. ''Three days doesn't really change anything,'' she said. ''There has to be continuous follow-up and reinforcement. But at least the program gives me a foundation on which to build.''</p>
        <p>In the 1999-2000 school year, Ms. Fagin, the CAPS executive director,  said, the bully-prevention program was presented in some 700 classrooms, and demand has grown 25 to 30 percent a year. CAPS introduced two similar programs this year, one for the second and third grades, the other for the sixth and seventh.</p>
        <p>She said that the growing interest might be a result of increasing reports of school violence and that the days of treating bullying as an inevitable and somehow instructive chapter in childhood were ending.</p>
        <p>Nancy Beckmeyer, a fifth-grade teacher in Saddle Rock whose class participated in the workshops last year, said that the pervasive rudeness promoted in the music, video games and cartoons that children saw and heard desensitized them to crass behavior. The antibullying program attempts to reverse that trend.</p>
        <p>The first session in the three-part workshop for fourth and fifth graders starts off by teaching children to pay attention to the feelings of their classmates and friends who are mistreated, either socially or physically.</p>
        <p>Using pictures and role playing, the students are asked to identify what facial expressions and body language might convey about feelings. Then they are sent home with a ''feelings detective'' work sheet on which they describe what family members and friends are expressing after observing physical, facial and situational clues.</p>
        <p>''You might think that this is basic, but it's not,'' Ms. Greulich said.  ''Kids very often don't know how to pick up on people's feelings.'' In her presentation she told the students: ''Words are like toothpaste. Once they're squeezed out, there's no getting them back into the tube.''</p>
        <p>The first session ended with a series of hypothetical questions: How much courage does it take to stand up for a friend who is being bullied?  By show of hands, the students  agreed that it only took a small amount of courage.</p>
        <p>The second question was ''How much courage does it take to get a popular kid to stop teasing an unpopular one?'' Quite a lot more, the  consensus was. By Day 2 of the program, after the students have spent some time paying attention to the feelings of others, they were asked to examine their own.</p>
        <p>To do that, Ms. Greulich asked the class a series of questions: ''What do you do when you see someone sitting alone at recess?'' ''What would you do if you saw someone fall off a swing in the playground?'' ''What would you say if you were playing with one group and your best friend was sitting alone?''</p>
        <p>On Day 3, the workshop concluded  with a video and a discussion that gave the students strategies for coping with bullying. The tactics included making light of insults, and undermining teasing by using humor and by being assertive. But the real emphasis was on helping the students  determine when to seek help.</p>
        <p>''One student recently asked what he should do if a weapon was involved,'' Ms. Greulich said. The answer, of course, is to find a teacher, police officer, anyone in authority, but children, often afraid of being tattletales or fearful of retribution, may not be inclined to seek help.</p>
        <p>Whether the bully-prevention program's consciousness-raising actually works is difficult to know.</p>
        <p>Dr. Laura Silver, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan who wrote the bully-prevention program with Ms. Cathers of CAPS, is confident it will. ''Although events like the one that occurred in Columbine are very rare, we do know from the literature that 15 percent of the population is exposed to bullying,'' she said. ''This results in depression and declining academic performance. Even the bullies themselves are more likely to suffer from poor academic performance and increased risks of committing criminal offenses. People think bullying is a rite of passage, but the literature shows that it can actually have some damaging effects on both the bullied and the bully.''</p>
        <p>Saddle Brook's vice principal, Victor Calaman, supports the program for another reason. ''Published scores, statewide school rankings and the new emphasis on testing have taken the focus off social behavior and placed it on academics,'' he said. ''But they are both equally important.''</p>
