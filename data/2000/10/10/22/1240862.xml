        <p>CUPID has long been known to unleash his arrows among dog owners, and New York parks provide particularly good hunting.</p>
        <p>So it makes sense that romance seekers spend time plotting how best to succeed at the dog run. Some think that possession of an icebreaker, like a Pomeranian puppy, is a good route. Meanwhile, among the city's animal doctors, the word is that a three-legged dog is the ultimate babe magnet, according to Mark Gibson, a Park Slope veterinarian.</p>
        <p>But whatever works best, there are many stories of love that started on a dog walk in the park.</p>
        <p>Jessica Smith, a public relations writer, met her partner of 18 months at the dog run at DeWitt Clinton Park at 11th Avenue and 52nd Street. Ms. Smith describes the attractions of canine courting this way: ''It's such a better date than a bar or movie. You can sit and talk. It's a reason to be outside and it's free, not to mention how fantastic it is to play with all the other dogs.''</p>
        <p>When Dr. Rebecca Campbell, 38, a veterinarian, adopted a Russian wolfhound that she did not have the heart to euthanize, her friends said the dog would be a great way to meet men. She was doubtful. ''Yeah, right,'' she recalls saying. ''Everyone in Park Slope is either gay or married.''</p>
        <p>But soon she met Malcolm Smart, 43, a musician and the owner of a chow mix, at Prospect Park, and like Ms. Smith came to admire the matchmaking power of the pet scene.</p>
        <p>''It's quite a kaffeeklatsch, a fantastic way to meet people, not the same as trying to catch someone's eye in a bar or at a party,'' Dr. Campbell said.</p>
        <p>Actually, the couple's dogs met first. ''A wolfhound doesn't like most dogs, but Simkha liked Morgan,'' said Dr. Campbell, who is now married to Mr. Smart and expecting a son next month. (He'll have plenty of siblings. They now have four dogs and four cats.) ''I'm sure we wouldn't have started dating if the dogs hadn't liked each other,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Pet relations often play a big role in human relations. When Sue Nastasi first met her photographer husband Michael, in 1998, he was walking his Rhodesian ridgeback in Central Park and she had her boxer and two chihuahua-terrier mixes. She thought Michael was ''really cute'' and hired him for a photo job. When she  picked up the shots she brought along her boxer. ''I remember saying, 'Too bad I have a boyfriend, because our dogs get along great,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>A few months later Ms. Nastasi broke up with her boyfriend, nature took its course and, at the wedding, special places were set for the four dogs in recognition of their matchmaking skills.</p>
        <p>Not all romances run smoothly. And having a dog in tow can make a breakup complicated.</p>
        <p>Robin Klein, a filmmaker, and Mick Gochanour, a rock music producer, talked and walked their dogs night after night for five months. Both had significant others, but when those relationships dissolved, Mr. Gochanour moved in with Ms. Klein.  He then sought joint custody of his dog, whom he had cared for with his ex-girlfriend, but she refused.</p>
        <p>That was in 1994. During the last six years, Mr. Gochanour has seen the dog, Merlin, being walked by his ex, who has since married another dog owner. But if Merlin remembers his former master, he won't let on. The tail vibrates but refuses to wag. ''It's the ultimate snub,'' Mr. Gochanour said.</p>
        <p>Some dog custody battles are resolved amicably. When Jamie Gardner, a social worker, and Mike Lakritz, a computer programmer, broke up in January, they worked out a joint custody deal for their white Akita mix, Kona. Each has the dog for several weeks at a time.</p>
        <p>''We don't know how Kona feels about the arrangement,'' Ms. Gardner said. But the two keep toys, a bed and water bowls in both homes to make the transition seamless.</p>
        <p>Heading to the local dog run isn't the only way to meet pet-friendly types. Although the computer can't walk your dog, in this virtual age you can scout out romance on line. PetPlanet.com, a pet site, has a matchmaking service.</p>
        <p>But only pet parents need apply.</p>
