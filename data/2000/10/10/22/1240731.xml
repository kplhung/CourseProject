        <p>FOR many years the Naugatuck River had a reputation as one of the dirtiest, most dangerous rivers in the state. Now that dubious distinction could be its salvation.</p>
        <p>After a flood in 1955 destroyed industrial plants along the river, nobody wanted to rebuild there, which allowed the river to begin to recover. The process quickened with the passage of the federal Clean Water Act more than a quarter-century ago, and in the early 1980's environmental groups began to organize cleanup efforts.</p>
        <p>''Now comes the last piece of the puzzle -- a movement not only to clean up the water, but to allow for fish passage, and to return the river to a more free-flowing, natural state,'' said Albin J. Weber, president of the Naugatuck Valley chapter of Trout Unlimited, one of the environmental groups.</p>
        <p>That movement has already resulted in the removal of four dams on the Naugatuck. Two more are slated for demolition, and funding is in place to create a special passage that will allow fish and canoes to get by the one dam that will remain on more than 30 miles of the river.</p>
        <p>''We've become the poster child for dam removal, and it's all happened on a blue-collar river in a valley that really needs a success story,'' Mr. Weber said. ''I can't wait for the day when I'm sitting on a park bench beside that river and watching someone catch a sea run brown trout and I'll be able to say, I can remember when fish couldn't live in that river.''</p>
        <p>The developments on the Naugatuck are an example of a movement sweeping the country to remove dams and allow rivers to return to their natural flows, and there have been some amazing success stories. In Maine, advocates for the environment forced the removal of a huge dam on the Kennebec River; less than a year later sturgeon, shad, salmon, striped bass and alewives teemed in waters where they had not been seen for more than 160 years.</p>
        <p>''The success on the Kennebec is sparking discussion all over the country,'' said Margery C. Winters, director of programs and research for the Rivers Coalition, an environmental group. ''Certainly dams, if they're operated correctly and they have fish ladders, are not as much of a problem, but we'd like to see all rivers flowing naturally.''</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, where 4,400 dams control rivers and streams, there is also a movement to reduce the number of dams, with environmentalists protesting the relicensing of two hydroelectric dams on the Housatonic River in northwestern Connecticut. Also of concern are all the dams that remain on the rivers from the state's industrial past, dams that still block rivers long after the industries that put them there have disappeared.</p>
        <p>''There are hundreds of little dams throughout the state, not really doing anything, just there because they were built eons ago in Connecticut's water-powered past, and some of them are just accidents waiting to happen,'' Ms. Winters said.</p>
        <p>But Richard A. Jacobson, assistant director of the State Department of Environmental Protection's fisheries division, said regulators had to balance the demands of those advocating ''run of the river'' against the need for hydropower, drinking water, recreational uses such as boating, and flood control that dams provide.</p>
        <p>''Would our streams in Connecticut be healthier if all the dams were removed? Probably so,'' Mr. Jacobson said. ''Would it be socially responsible to remove all the dams? Probably not. Whenever we look at river restoration, we also have to look at the consequences of any action that we take.''</p>
        <p>Hydroelectric power, however, is a small component of the state's production. Hydroelectric generated about 130 megawatts during the 1990's, about 4 percent of the generating capacity of Northeast Utilities before the industry was deregulated this year. In contrast, Millstone II, the smallest of Northeast's nuclear plants, generated 870 megawatts.</p>
        <p>Ms. Winters said her group recognized that hydroelectric power was renewable and nonpolluting, and that the reservoirs created by dams could provide some advantages.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to support any dam, but we recognize that some of them provide society some benefit,'' Ms. Winters said. ''We're trying to be a reasonable organization. But there are a lot of dams that could be removed, and if they're old and they're providing virtually no benefit to society, they should be removed.''</p>
        <p>The construction of dams began in Connecticut in the 1630's when colonists harnessed the state's fast-flowing rivers to grind grain and cut wood. Later, water power would run textile mills, provide fire protection, and generate electricity.</p>
        <p>The State Department of Environmental Protection said about 1,500 of the state's dams were regulated because they could, if they failed, pose some risk to life or property, and more than 600 were deemed significant enough to warrant annual inspection.</p>
        <p>The last reported fatalities from a dam failure were in 1963, when the Spaulding Dam in Norwich burst, killing six people and causing $6 million in damage. During the June floods of 1982, 17 dams were breached in Connecticut, causing an estimated $70 million in property damage.</p>
        <p>But dams can cause damage even when they do not fail, environmentalists contend. When the water is captured, it backs up and floods wetlands and marshes that provide habitat to fish and wildlife. The turbulent waters below a dam can scour a riverbed of life and create a danger to people who get trapped in the currents. The periodic release of water causes such temperature fluctuations downstream that it can cause fish kills.</p>
        <p>''All of the industries that once relied on dams have long since gone, and the dams are still there, leaving only a legacy of environmental disaster,'' said Ronald R. Whiteley of Ledyard, president of the Connecticut-Rhode Island Coastal Flyfishers, and a member of the board of directors of the Thames Valley chapter of Trout Unlimited.</p>
        <p>The groups said those dams included ones on the Willimantic and Quinebaug Rivers that once powered textile mills. The dams are still standing because they would be expensive to tear down, and in many cases, it is unclear who would be responsible for the bill: the municipality, the state, or the companies that put them there. Because most of these companies are now defunct, the issue gets even murkier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whiteley's organizations are also lobbying for the removal of the Tunnel and Taftville dams, two hydroelectric dams on the Quinebaug River, just north of Norwich, which are owned by a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, which operates 27 dams around the state. While most people think of dams as a hindrance only to salmon and shad, there are 15 or 20 species that historically ran up the Quinebaug and are now blocked, he said, including herring, smelt, lamprey and American eels.</p>
        <p>''We've been talking to Northeast Utilities about these dams for 10 years,'' Mr. Whiteley said. ''Our position would be, we'd like to see the dams removed. If we have to settle for a fish ladder, I guess we'll settle for one, but the thing we'd really like to see is the removal of both dams. They're outlived their usefulness, and now they're just a hindrance to making progress in the environmental health of the river.''</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for Northeast did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobson of the Department of Environmental Protection agreed that dams nearly always disrupt fish habitat. Largemouth and smallmouth bass are not native to the state, but they have taken hold in many larger rivers, while trout and many small fish that provide food for game species, such as long-nosed and black-nosed dace, cannot get over a dam. Even fish ladders prove impassable to some species that migrate up rivers, such as short-nosed sturgeon, he said.</p>
        <p>''In terms of trying to meet all our river restoration objectives, dam removal is certainly the best way to go,'' Mr. Jacobson said. ''Even when a stream isn't a habitat for anadromous fishes, dam removal is preferable,''</p>
        <p>In some areas, where removal of the dams is not an option, environmentalists are pushing for a steadier flow of water so the habitat is not as badly disrupted.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Piquette of Trumbull, chairman of the Housatonic Coalition, said the groups in that organization lobbied for a ''run of the river'' flow to be restored in a relicensing hearing for the Northeast Utilities dams on the Housatonic River. Its license is up next year.</p>
        <p>''Now, they're going to have to generate power uniformly through the day, so there will be no more widely fluctuating flows,'' Mr. Piquette said. The flow of the river is altered depending on the demand for power.</p>
        <p>Canaan First Selectman Charles H. Lewis, a former chairman of the Housatonic River Commission, said his loyalties were divided.</p>
        <p>''My environmental consciousness says, 'run of the river' is great, and I can't wait for it,'' Mr. Lewis said. On the other hand, $260,000 of the town's $3 million in revenues, nearly 10 percent, come from the Northeast Utilities dam and power plant at Falls Village, ''and I also have to worry about the town's tax base.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Piquette said the relicensing process got under way before some of the recent success stories involving dam removal became widely known, so there was no public outcry against the dams.</p>
        <p>''The idea of removal of the dams never really came up, so we looked at it from the point of view that if the dams are going to stay there, what's the best we can get out of it?'' Mr. Piquette said. ''It's a big compromise, particularly considering that there are some very strong constituencies in favor of the status quo -- not just the power company, but the white water rafters.''</p>
        <p>''I think we're too far along in the licensing process now to start talking about dam removal,'' Mr. Piquette said. But the dams will be up for relicensing in another 30 years, ''and hopefully, by then, we'll be able to get them taken out. Ultimately, the best solution would be for the dams to be removed completely.''</p>
        <p>That isn't always the case, said Curtis S. Read, president of Hydro Technologies, an environmental laboratory in New Milford. He is also chairman of the Litchfield County Soil and Water Conservation District and a member of the Bridgewater Conservation and Inland Wetlands Commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Read has been active in the debate about the Shepaug River, where Waterbury operates a series of reservoirs and a dam. River advocates earlier this year won a lawsuit claiming that Waterbury diverted too much water away from the river. Although the case is on appeal, everyone expects that Waterbury will be forced to restore a steady flow year-round.</p>
        <p>Mr. Read said he had seen historic pictures of the Shepaug that showed it nearly dried up in August, and the resolution of this case would prevent that from occurring.</p>
        <p>''The river will be better off in the dry months having the reservoir there -- it's really a very good solution,'' Mr. Read said. ''It satisfies the needs of people for potable water and recreational uses, and still maintains a good habitat along the river.''</p>
        <p>''Where there are old dams that were originally put in place for an industrial purpose, it's a good idea to take them down. The problem is, there are a lot of people who say, 'take them all down,' but is that realistic?'' Mr. Read said. ''It's got to be done on a case-by-case basis.''</p>
