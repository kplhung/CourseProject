        <p>It might seem like poor sportsmanship to say it, but it probably should be noted: the Subway Series Special train did not run on time last night.</p>
        <p>Of course, there were two very good reasons why it was late, one named Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the other named Gov. George E. Pataki, both of whom boarded the subway train at Grand Central Terminal last night in the name of promoting public transportation and the nation's pastime.</p>
        <p>The special train -- made up of 10 new, high-tech subway cars decorated with elaborate decals of the Mets and Yankees logos and a pinstriped front and rear -- was supposed to arrive at Grand Central about 7:05 p.m., with the mayor and the governor riding shotgun.</p>
        <p>But because of security precautions and the logistical hurdles involved in cramming the two officials, members of their families and all of their aides and bodyguards into the front car of the train, the No. 4 actually pulled in at just after 7:30, to the cheers of hundreds of fans who had passed up several perfectly good No. 4 trains to wait for it.</p>
        <p>As the platform began to fill up around 7 p.m., Grand Central at first took on the air of a gigantic sports bar, minus most of the beer.</p>
        <p>Parts of the crowd broke out into sporadic chanting and clapping. On one section of platform, almost everyone waiting for the trains was sporting either Mets or Yankees clothing, with the majority decked out in enough blue and pinstripes to warm the heart of any Yankee sports merchandiser.</p>
        <p>The crowd leaned over the yellow edge of the platform, looking for the hopeful golden glow of headlights in the tunnel. But the headlights kept turning out to be No. 5 trains, each of them filled with only a few regular commuters, staring balefully out at the crowd, their thoughts perhaps focused on all those World Series tickets crammed in the pockets of those waiting.</p>
        <p>Peter Schneidkraut, 46, and his son Gary, 13, who had never been on a subway before, decided to forget about the shiny new train and the chief executives and took the next regular No. 4 train that came along. ''Forget it -- look at all this crowding,'' said Mr. Schneidkraut, who lives in New City, N.Y. ''A train's a train, right? We'll take this one.''</p>
        <p>As the crowd began to bond and commiserate, Andy Massey and his friend Tich Robinson, who had come from Tampa, Fla., for the game, began to spread the word that they thought they had seen the mayor and the governor upstairs, outside the terminal, climbing into a limousine. In other words, forsaking the people's limousine. This served mainly to stir up the crowd.</p>
        <p>And most of this frustration found its way to James Ditzian, the beleaguered conductor of the No. 5 train that was held in the station for about 10 minutes just before the special No. 4 arrived.</p>
        <p>''This is going to be a record for me,'' Mr. Ditzian said, looking at a lighted screen in front of him on the platform that told him how long his train had been held. The screen read 511 seconds and ticking. ''The highest I've ever seen, ever, on this line is maybe 130 seconds or something.''</p>
        <p>But the Subway Series Special finally arrived, and as they poured on, fans seemed to immediately forget their commuting problems. About five non-official commuters were able to elbow their way into the front car with the mayor and the governor, where they were immediately sandwiched between television cameras.</p>
        <p>As the train glided northward, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki both stood and the governor demonstrated his subway-riding prowess by signing autographs for most of the trip and not holding onto the handrails.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani avoided questions about possible new stadiums and acted much like any father taking his son to the game in a crowded subway car would: he scolded his son, Andrew, 14, for standing up on the seats to look out the window.</p>
        <p>The train arrived at Yankee Stadium and disgorged its passengers about 8:05, after three New Jersey high school bands had performed and after the players of both teams had been announced. But it appeared that the fans, official and non-official, would make it for the start of the game.</p>
        <p>''It was a great ride,'' Mr. Pataki announced.</p>
