        <p>Armando Benitez and Mariano Rivera become different pitchers every October. Rivera, the Yankees' closer, elevates his performance. Benitez, the Mets' closer, often crumbles. That disparity could be the most glaring in this World Series.</p>
        <p>In Game 1, Benitez blew his fourth save in six postseason chances with the Mets. Rivera, meanwhile, worked two scoreless innings. He was the second of three Yankees relievers who held the Mets scoreless over the final five and a third innings of Game 1 of the World Series, a 4-3 Yankees victory in 12 innings this morning.</p>
        <p>''Their bullpen pitched well,'' said the Mets' right-hander Turk Wendell, who gave up Jose Vizcaino's game-winning single and was the losing pitcher. ''It came down to the bullpen, and they won.''</p>
        <p>Al Leiter worked seven strong innings, turning a 3-2 lead over to John Franco in the eighth. Franco worked a scoreless inning and Benitez came on in the ninth, exactly the alignment Manager Bobby Valentine strives for every game.</p>
        <p>But Benitez could not hold it. He got one out, then walked Paul O'Neill and allowed a single to the pinch-hitter Luis Polonia. Vizcaino poked a single to left, loading the bases, and O'Neill scored the tying run on a sacrifice fly by Chuck Knoblauch. Benitez struck out Derek Jeter to end the inning, but the Mets would never lead again.</p>
        <p>''I thought he had his control,'' Valentine said. ''He just missed getting O'Neill out, and they got a couple of singles.''</p>
        <p>But that inning was enough to unravel what stood to be a crucial victory for the Mets, who could have gone into Game 2 with a 1-0 Series lead, Mike Hampton on the mound tonight and the three following games scheduled for Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>It also cost Leiter a victory, and he is still without one in 10 postseason starts. Benitez is a big reason why: three of Benitez's blown saves in the postseason have cost Leiter victories.</p>
        <p>In the last year and a half, Benitez has developed from an unpredictable setup man to a dependable closer. But he has consistently struggled when it matters the most.</p>
        <p>Benitez blew the save in the final games of the 1999 division series against Arizona and the National League Championship Series against Atlanta. This year, he blew Game 2 of the division series against the Giants and, now, Game 1 of the World Series.</p>
        <p>He saved Game 4 of last year's N.L.C.S. and Game 2 of the same round this year, but his overall futility has continued a disturbing trend of playoff failures that began with his previous team, the Baltimore Orioles. Benitez lost two games in the 1997 American League Championship Series and was hit hard by the Yankees in the same round in 1996.</p>
        <p>In 28 1/3 postseason innings, Benitez has allowed seven home runs, the most by a reliever in postseason history.</p>
        <p>Dennis Cook relieved Benitez in the 10th, and entered with an impressive October resume. In 16 innings over four postseasons, the left-hander has never allowed a run. Only Glendon Rusch's efforts kept that streak alive, after Cook walked David Justice and Bernie Williams to open the bottom of the 10th.</p>
        <p>The pitching coach Dave Wallace came to the mound after that, bringing in Rusch, and Cook barked at Ed Montague, the plate umpire, as he left the mound. Rusch bounced a wild pitch with Tino Martinez batting, advancing the runners to second and third and forcing Valentine to move in his outfielders.</p>
        <p>Left fielder Joe McEwing had to charge in just a few steps to catch a soft liner by Martinez for the first out. Rusch walked Jorge Posada intentionally before getting O'Neill to ground into a double play.</p>
        <p>Rusch, who had a breakout season with his performance and toughness, held his fist in front of him as he walked off the mound, holding his head high. But Rusch himself would need help in the 11th, and Wendell got Glenallen Hill to fly to right, ending the inning with two men on.</p>
        <p>There was nobody to save Wendell in the 12th. Wendell, a durable setup man, had another strong season this year. But his season was marked by memorable failures; four times, Wendell allowed a game-winning homer in the opposing team's last at-bat.</p>
        <p>This time, he was done in by three hits in the 12th. With one out, Martinez singled, and Posada skipped a double past Alfonzo at second. After an intentional walk and a pop out, Vizcaino singled home the winning run.</p>
        <p>Wendell had fulfilled a dream by being on the mound at the end of a World Series game. Of course, this ending was different than what he has hoped for.</p>
        <p>''This is what it's all about,'' Wendell said. ''This is what I always envisioned -- but it usually didn't end this way.''</p>
