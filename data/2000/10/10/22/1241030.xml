        <p>American and Yemeni investigators were encamped today at a remote boat ramp seeking clues to the identity of the two suicide bombers who launched a small boat and headed into Aden's harbor for the attack on the destroyer Cole, which killed 17 American sailors.</p>
        <p>With Navy officials in Washington having revised their initial accounts of how the bombers blindsided the Cole, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other American specialists set up a cluster of dark green tents beside the boat ramp, six miles across the Bay of Aden from the harbor mooring point where the Cole was attacked.</p>
        <p>Just off shore, by an area of broken ground bare of anything save clumps of sage brush, there was a rusting old dredger, and agents in small boats appeared to be plumbing the water.</p>
        <p>The discovery of the attack craft's launching point came this week after a 12-year-old boy told the Yemeni police that a bearded man with spectacles had given him small change worth $12.50 to watch a car and boat trailer, launched a boat into the water and disappeared.</p>
        <p>With that breakthrough, the investigators quickly found the abandoned car and boat trailer. The investigators also located two safe houses that they believe were used by the bombers and evidence that they had lived in at least one of the houses while fabricating the bomb.</p>
        <p>For several days, these areas were sealed off to reporters by Yemeni authorities. American officials in Aden refused to confirm any details provided by the Yemenis, even after Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, did so in a television interview on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>But today Yemeni officials relented and allowed reporters on a closely scrutinized tour of the area where the bombers are said to have holed up for about two months. Later, the American ambassador, Barbara K. Bodine, said at a news conference that the investigation had been slow, but sure. ''It's going very well, it's expanding, and we're confident it's going to be successful,'' she said. ''But it's going to be a slow process.''</p>
        <p>The tour included Little Aden, as the peninsula across the bay from the city of Aden is known, and a neighboring district called Madinat ash Shab, the neighborhoods where the two safe houses are located. The tour also passed across a bridge on an inlet into the bay in which the boat ramp and F.B.I. tents were clearly visible.</p>
        <p>From the tour, and from disclosures in Washington on Friday, a new picture emerged of how it was possible for the attackers to sneak up on one of the Navy's newest and most sophisticated warships and detonate an explosion that, in addition to killing 17 crew members, wounded 39 others and did extensive damage.</p>
        <p>The boat ramp, one of two beside the bridge linking the Little Aden peninsula to the mainland, appeared to have given the attackers a perfect launching point.</p>
        <p>It is in a relatively quiet area of residential neighborhoods, a power plant and an oil storage depot, miles from Aden's main waterfront, but with a clear view of the entry to the harbor from the open sea.</p>
        <p>Aden's main docks are busy throughout the day, and Yemeni soldiers in camouflage uniforms guard every harbor entry, mainly to prevent the smuggling that has denied the government of this impoverished country crucial tax revenues.</p>
        <p>It appears that the attackers would have been able to enter the bay largely unobserved and for most of their journey toward the Cole not enter into the area likely to have been most closely watched by lookouts aboard the destroyer.</p>
        <p>On Friday, officials in Washington disclosed that the attack boat, described as a skiff, circled the Cole's bow from the west then slowly skirted the ship's port side, with the two men aboard the skiff waving to armed sailors on the Navy ship and the sailors waving back.</p>
        <p>The new account indicated that the destroyer -- which would have been about 20 minutes away by small boat from the launching point -- had been moored for nearly two hours when it was struck.</p>
        <p>Yemeni and American officials have concluded that the two men aboard the boat, who were reported to have stood up just as the explosion detonated, were killed in the blast. An F.B.I. forensic laboratory set up on board one of the ships in a United States Navy flotilla in Aden harbor is said to be examining fragments of human remains, clothing and fiberglass shards from the attack craft.</p>
        <p>President Saleh has said that Yemeni investigators learned that the two men who used the safe houses spoke with Saudi Arabian accents. Yemeni officials said that could mean that they either came from Saudi Arabia or from a Yemeni province, Hadhramaut, that abuts Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>These facts have centered attention on Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi Arabian financier from a family with origins in Hadhramaut, who is accused of terrorism. Mr. bin Laden, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, is known to have issued threats against American targets that were broadcast in a videotape shown on a Middle East television channel only last month.</p>
        <p>Although it was not clear from the videotape when it was filmed, investigators are studying the possibility of a link to the Aden attack. The Taliban authorities who rule most of Afghanistan have strongly denied that Mr. bin Laden, who is said to be under effective house arrest, was in any position to organize a terror attack at least a thousand miles away.</p>
        <p>The reporters' tour of Little Aden showed the safe house in which the supposed attackers spent most of their time. The bungalow, set behind cinder-block walls about half a mile from the bay, is in an area of villas built for British colonial officials and now inhabited by refinery workers, Yemeni government officials and mostly middle-class families.</p>
        <p>Yemeni officials said the house showed signs of efforts by the occupiers to cut off sightlines from neighboring houses. On one side stands a new corrugated-iron fence at least 10 feet high. A set of rust-colored steel gates with sharp spikes had been erected to guard access to an area beside the house where, the officials said, the men appeared to have prepared the boat and the bomb.</p>
        <p>Peering through the cinder-block wall, reporters could see spots where investigators seemed to have dug into the ground, and there appeared to be an empty steel tank from which sections of metal had been excised with a metal cutter. Smoke marks on the tank indicated that the men had filled it with water and tested the outboard motor in it.</p>
        <p>Yemeni officials said the house was the second rented by the presumed attackers. Another house, about five miles away on the northern side of the Bay of Aden, was a more modest affair.The Yemeni officials said the two men appear to have moved to Little Aden for greater space and privacy.</p>
