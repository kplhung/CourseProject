        <p>Accusing a predecessor of raising fees for passports and other consular services without permission, the head of the Dominican Consulate in New York announced a series of reductions yesterday in service costs  paid by Dominicans, the city's poorest immigrant group.</p>
        <p>The announcement by Luis Eludis Perez, the consul general, fulfilled a campaign promise made by the man who appointed Mr. Perez to his post, Hipolito Mejia, the Dominican Republic's new president. Long-running complaints about excessive fees at the New York consulate -- like $150 to return a body to the country for burial -- became a major issue in the country's presidential campaign last spring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez made the announcement at the first of what he promised would be a series of community meetings sponsored by the consulate at which Dominicans would be free to express their concerns. The meeting, held in a packed gymnasium at  Public School 42 in Washington Heights, drew more than 200 people and produced a list of frustrations -- with the consulate and with city government -- from members of one of the city's largest immigrant groups.</p>
        <p>Along with chastising the consulate's fees, dozens of speakers demanded the construction of a second neighborhood high school, more after-school programs for youths and a halt to the planned construction of a prison on 181st Street.</p>
        <p>Many Dominicans said they had seen many promises go unfulfilled in the past but were pleased with Mr. Perez so far.</p>
        <p>''It's very positive,'' said Milciades Soto, who attended the meeting with his two young daughters. ''It's a good start.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez said that as of Jan. 1, the cost of obtaining a new six-year passport would drop from $200 -- one of the highest rates in the world -- to $96.50.</p>
        <p>Other passport fees will also be reduced, he said. Fees for other consular services that had cost $190 or $178 would be reduced to $105, he said.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of immigrants who paid the consulate's high service fees have long suspected that the costs were improper and abusive. The newly elected Dominican government has started an investigation.</p>
        <p>Bienvenido Perez, the consul general from 1996 to 1999, has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's meeting, people called for unity in among Dominican-Americans. They said infighting among Dominicans, who number 600,000 in the city, had contributed to a weakening of their political power.</p>
        <p>''I believe that if we keep holding these assemblies, and if the organizations cooperate, we can achieve something,'' said Sarita Sanchez, 66, founder of the Dominican Civic and Cultural Center, a nonprofit group that provides after-school programs. ''We need more unity.''</p>
