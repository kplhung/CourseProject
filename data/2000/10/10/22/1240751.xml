        <p>AUTUMN on the North Fork is what summer is on the South Fork: the season when the area glows. This time of year many Long Islanders drive east to visit fall festivals, tour vineyards, pick pumpkins and apples and savor an ear of roasted corn at a farmstand.</p>

        <p>AUTUMN on the North Fork is what summer is on the South Fork: the season when the area glows. This time of year many Long Islanders drive east to visit fall festivals, tour vineyards, pick pumpkins and apples and savor an ear of roasted corn at a farmstand.</p>
        <p>At the end of the ride, a potential topper to the day is dinner at the Antares Cafe in Greenport. Situated in the Brewer Yacht Yard, it is casual enough for diners arriving in their hayride clothes. Still, this is a serious restaurant with Manhattan food and Hamptons prices.</p>
        <p>The new spot is named for the bright red star Antares. Walls of the restaurant are painted a pleasing cherry red in its honor. They hold an arresting display of mirrors, engravings, photographs, architectural drawings and posters. Still it is the outdoor deck that provides most of the seating.</p>
        <p>Outdoors in October? One nippy fall evening we arrived in jeans, sweaters and blazers, ready to give the covered deck a try. Plastic sides were rolled down and two powerful heaters provided warmth. By meal's end, we had shed our jackets. The restaurant plans to remain open till New Year's Eve, then close for January and February, giving the chef-co-owner, Mathew Murphy, time to get married and have a honeymoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy has an impressive resume (He was one of the chefs who opened March and was the executive sous chef at La Colombre D'Or, the Rainbow Room and the Ritz Carlton in Manhattan.) and it shows in the food. Given Antares's boatyard location, diners might expect fried clams or lobsters in the rough. Instead, think saddle of venison in a juniper berry-wine sauce and roasted lobster and crayfish in an ice wine sauce.</p>
        <p>Both of those entrees are top of the line. Three juicy venison medallions were fork tender, medium-rare as ordered and surrounded a tasty mash of white turnips. The lobster was removed form the shell, set upon a mound of julienned leeks and napped with the lush wine sauce. Baby vegetables ringed the plate and tempura-battered crayfish accented it.</p>
        <p>Other must-orders are the filet mignon with its wonderful salt crust, the fall-away-tender duck confit boasting crisp skin and the huge bowl of fettuccine tossed with wild mushrooms, tomato, basil and garlic and garnished with Italian sheep's milk cheese. A grilled hanger steak was tender and juicy but overwhelmed by its platemate, a soy-dressed Asian salad of hearts of palm, tomatoes, celery, radish and watercress.</p>
        <p>Two fish to try are the seared tuna paired with soba noodles and Asian vegetables, and the sauteed Arctic char with spinach, shelled mussels and saffron sauce.</p>
        <p>Big spenders should not pass up the foie gras ($13.50), a beautiful appetizer highlighted by mango, crystallized ginger and cassis and passion fruit jellies. Another fine opener is the smoked salmon. This is not the usual slices but fresh salmon that the restaurant has smoked. The beautifully smoky flavored fish is chopped, formed into ovals and served atop a dill-yogurt sauce. Salmon and golden whitefish caviars garnish the plate. Other winners are the soy-glazed whiting fillets paired with grapefruit segments and placed on a tasty lentil wafer, and a flavorful soup: half tomato, half sorrel.</p>
        <p>The first bite of the shrimp tempura was positive: lightly battered, crunchy seafood placed on a spicy carrot-curry sauce. But subsequent bites exposed shrimp that had grown soggy in the sauce.</p>
        <p>My favorite dessert was the unmolded chocolate souffle (similar to a moist flourless cake) accompanied by a mound of white chocolate mousse and a scoop of mint ice cream. More unusual and just as pleasing were the caramelized pineapple slice glazed with a custard sauce, and the combination plate of baked Portuguese cheese, poached pears, a drizzle of lavender honey and two crisp almond cookies. It works. A Napoleon of bananas and chocolate will disappoint diners expecting the usual whipped cream or pastry cream. Peanut butter ice cream, on the side, provided the only creamy component.</p>
        <p>Antares Cafe  2530 Manhasset Avenue (in the Brewer Yacht Yard), Greenport  (631) 477-8839.  Very Good</p>
