        <p>A DOZEN years ago, Katherine Heaviside awoke to a 7 a.m. phone call from a Manhattan lawyer who sometimes steered damage-control work her way. ''Get the paper,'' he commanded. ''My client's on the front page.''</p>

        <p>A DOZEN years ago, Katherine Heaviside awoke to a 7 a.m. phone call from a Manhattan lawyer who sometimes steered damage-control work her way. ''Get the paper,'' he commanded. ''My client's on the front page.''</p>
        <p>It turned out that the police had charged his client with bilking clients of $10 million, diverting stock market investments and buying Early American art instead. ''The lawyer essentially wanted me on board to field press calls and say, 'No comment,' '' Ms. Heaviside, a Huntington public relations executive, recalled. ''He thought that was the way to handle this sort of situation. In fact, that's the way it was usually handled in those days.</p>
        <p>''I told him, 'The media is going to put a camera in the face of a little old lady who just lost her life savings, and we're going to say ''No comment''?' How do you think that's going to look?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Heaviside, the president and founder of Epoch 5 Marketing, got the account, including final say on the crisis-management plan. ''We called a press conference, and I think surprised everyone by what we had: a comparison of the client's returns from the art investments with returns from the stock market, which had crashed in October. It turned out his art investments actually avoided steeper losses.'' Ms. Heaviside also announced a restitution plan for investors.</p>
        <p>This was classic Heaviside: act quickly, face the media and come armed with information few reporters would dig up on their own. And especially, maintain composure: never appear flustered or uncertain.</p>
        <p>The strategy, she said, ''helped reposition'' the client -- and the many that have followed -- in ''the court of public opinion,'' a favorite Heaviside phrase. In the intervening years what is now called crisis communications, a hybrid discipline combining aspects of traditional public relations with a working knowledge of the legal system, has become a hot field.</p>
        <p>And on Long Island, the hottest practitioner is Katherine Heaviside (pronounced HEV-ih-side). A string of high-profile clients, including the Brookhaven National Laboratory and King Kullen, have hired her to handle damage control. For the perpetually maligned lab, it was responding to the public outcry over reported radiation leaks, and for the supermarket chain, it was dealing with the fallout from a labor dispute.</p>
        <p>Ms. Heaviside emphasized that she and her company also offer marketing, public relations and graphics services and that not all clients are facing crises. Still, her hot-seat visibility brings her invitations to speak at business programs around the country. On Thursday, for example, she is scheduled to moderate a crisis-management panel at Connection Day, a public relations conference at the Long Island Marriott in Uniondale.</p>
        <p>Gary Lewi, an executive vice president of Howard J. Rubenstein Associates, the Manhattan public relations firm, praises his competitor as ''a consummate professional, always poised.''</p>
        <p>Finding anyone who has anything negative to say -- on the record -- about Ms. Heaviside is much tougher. A dozen calls to competitors and former clients came up empty-handed. No one, it seems, is eager to cross swords with her.</p>
        <p>''Katherine understands that the best way to deal with a crisis is to have the best information available and have a plan for getting that information out to the public,'' said Rick Ferrell, who was an executive at Arbor Property Trust when it owned the Green Acres Shopping Center in Valley Stream.</p>
        <p>A string of shootings there about five years ago prompted the company to call in Ms. Heaviside. ''Katherine investigated incident reports from other Nassau County precincts and discovered that Green Acres actually reported fewer incidents per visitor than Roosevelt Field,'' Mr. Ferrell said. At Roosevelt Field, in Garden City, it's generally agreed that few customers fear for their safety.</p>
        <p>''She turned this information into a sound bite and totally changed the context of coverage,'' said Mr. Ferrell, who now works for the Forest City Ratner Companies in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 90's, Ms. Heaviside built her client roster with companies that were happy to hand her the microphone and to let her field the frenzied phone calls. She insists the frenzy can be contained, and to this end she has created a crisis inventory form that, she says, allows the client to rate the probability of all manner of crises, from hurricanes to liability suits. ''Handling a crisis smoothly is much more likely when you have access to the information you need and have people assigned to the roles they need to fill,'' she said.</p>
        <p>All was not smooth when Ms. Heaviside encountered angry protesters in 1997 when King Kullen announced plans to shut its Westbury warehouse.</p>
        <p>''King Kullen was a tough crisis,'' she recalled, drawing a deep breath. ''I was dealing with people who were threatening me. There were incidents. I remember speaking to a reporter during a rally and hearing a crowd of union guys shouting, 'Get her. Get her car.' I also got threatening phone calls.'' She said she was not harmed but felt shaken.</p>
        <p>Ron Carver, a spokesman for the Teamsters union in Washington, said: ''I don't believe that incident ever happened. I suspect that she's trying to embellish her resume.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Heaviside has received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Public Relations Professionals of Long Island, and she has not shied away from courting professional plaudits. Last year Epoch 5 won a Silver Anvil award from the Public Relations Society of America for the way it handled communications for Oak Tree Dairy Farm in Amityville after a 1997 fire nearly destroyed the dairy.</p>
        <p>The day after the fire, ''we developed and began implementation of a comprehensive plan to negate a history of community relations problems, build support for the reconstruction and to reassure retailers that they would continue to receive milk deliveries as usual,'' Ms. Heaviside wrote in a letter to the awards committee.</p>
        <p>After her company won the award, it put out a glossy mailer proclaiming that ''for 5,000 P.R. firms, this is the Holy Grail.''</p>
        <p>The crisis-communications field is likely to continue to grow, Ms. Heaviside contends. ''It's getting easier and easier for the public to learn about a crisis,'' she said. ''The definition of crisis is changing, too. Today people go to lawyers where once they would have said, 'Oh well, these things happen.' And people almost automatically suspect corporations aren't doing the right thing.</p>
        <p>''I believe the main thing we do for our clients is advocacy. We help them communicate well even when the situation is complex. We put in reference points to help make things more understandable.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Heaviside's manner is normally soft-spoken, precise and composed. But what really riles her is hearing ''spin control'' applied to her field.</p>
        <p>''I get a little crazed when I hear those words,'' she said. ''It implies disinformation. We don't do that. Our clients don't do that. Most of them are smart people who understand that if you present something that is not entirely truthful, eventually you're going to be hurt by that.''</p>
