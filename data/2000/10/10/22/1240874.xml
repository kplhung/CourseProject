        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Our perceived lack of image and positive identity comes from our loss of an acknowledged artistic cultural identity. New Jersey's image would be restored by its artistic heritage, which has been little spoken of and unseen for so long.</p>
        <p>However, Winslow Homer painted  ''Long Branch, New Jersey'' (1869) now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Thomas Eakins painted more landscapes in New Jersey than in Pennsylvania. He and his father owned a house in South Jersey. The most expensive American painting ever to sell at auction -- for $27.5 million -- was painted by George Bellows in Lakewood and titled ''Polo Crowd.'' These are just some of the headlines, alongside of which exits a deep and rich body of paintings undiscovered and unrecognized by our museums.</p>
        <p>The answer to the state's poor identity might be found in creating a museum that would focus on the artistic history of New Jersey, which is as rich and interesting as that of any state. Where we rank at the bottom is in our lack of success in making it known.</p>
