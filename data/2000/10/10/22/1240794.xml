        <p>EVEN in high school, Heather Sue Mercer was uncomfortable with the spotlight. As the first girl to play varsity football in Westchester, she did not enjoy being singled out, discouraging press coverage and agreeing only to pose for team -- not individual -- pictures.</p>
        <p>As a teenager, she told a reporter: ''I think it's kind of ridiculous how much attention I'm getting. If I can get it through the uprights, who cares what I am? I don't even think about it like I'm a girl football player. I just think of myself as a kicker.''</p>

        <p>EVEN in high school, Heather Sue Mercer was uncomfortable with the spotlight. As the first girl to play varsity football in Westchester, she did not enjoy being singled out, discouraging press coverage and agreeing only to pose for team -- not individual -- pictures.</p>
        <p>As a teenager, she told a reporter: ''I think it's kind of ridiculous how much attention I'm getting. If I can get it through the uprights, who cares what I am? I don't even think about it like I'm a girl football player. I just think of myself as a kicker.''</p>
        <p>All she wanted to do was play football, Ms. Mercer said, but her quest has been a battle, fueling even more unwanted publicity. On Oct. 12, a federal jury awarded the former place kicker $2 million in damages, ruling that Duke University had cut her from its football roster solely because of her sex.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mercer, now 24 and living in Manhattan, was happy with her victory and said she would use the award to create a scholarship fund for female kickers. She has not, however, warmed to the microphones.</p>
        <p>''I'm getting called day and night, and I'm not particularly liking the attention because it has nothing to do with what I'm doing or what I'm about,'' Ms. Mercer said. ''Unlike my high school experience, which was great, this was something I'd like to forget.''</p>
        <p>Those who follow local high school football remember Ms. Mercer for her statements on the field. Her high school career began in 1992, when Ms. Mercer, who had played varsity soccer since her freshman year, approached Yorktown High School's football coach, Ron Santavicca, about becoming a kicker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santavicca took her out to the goal post to see what she could do. She went 20 for 20, sending each one dead center between the uprights. As the coach kept moving her farther down the field, Ms. Mercer kept scoring. In her senior year, she was given a spot on the Yorktown Cornhuskers.</p>
        <p>''If she couldn't play, I wouldn't have let her play,'' said Mr. Santavicca, who flew to North Carolina to testify on her behalf. ''She was a good athlete, she worked hard and she contributed to a good football team. I'm sure she could have succeeded down there if she had been given the opportunity to kick.''</p>
        <p>She was given that opportunity in Yorktown, something she said she appreciates even more after her experience at Duke.</p>
        <p>''What's different now about how I look back at high school,'' she said, ''is that I'm amazed at the incredible maturity with which my teammates, my coaches and the administration handled the situation, which could have been such a serious distraction.''</p>
        <p>In her first game at Yorktown, she made a field goal and three extra points. The Huskers went on to win the state championship, and Ms. Mercer was named third string All-State kicker. She finished the season as the leading kicker in Westchester and Putnam, with 39 points, making 4 of 7 field goals and 27 of 30 extra points.</p>
        <p>''I was treated completely equally in high school,'' Ms. Mercer said. ''When I did something wrong, I was sent to the hill. That's why it was sort of astonishing to me what happened at Duke. I had never experienced that kind of prejudice.''</p>
        <p>Her football career at Duke was painful, Burton Craige, her lawyer, said.</p>
        <p>As a freshman, she tried out for Duke's football coach, Fred Goldsmith. He put her photograph in the media guide and told her she was on the team. She attended every practice, trying to prove that she had the right stuff to play Division I football.</p>
        <p>''She was at the most grueling and brutal winter conditionings,'' Mr. Craige said.</p>
        <p>But her lawsuit contended that she was never treated like the other players. She was not given a uniform, not allowed to sit with the team during home games and not allowed to kick during team practices. She was dropped from the team in her junior year, saying in the lawsuit that Coach Goldsmith told her she should try out for beauty pageants or cheerleading instead.</p>
        <p>''I grew up with a straightforward, 'If you can do it -- come on let's go' attitude,'' Ms. Mercer said. ''Then to all of a sudden enter a world where I was seen only as a woman and not as an athlete -- that was tough.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mercer sued Duke in 1997, alleging sex discrimination. Duke countered that she was not talented enough to be on the team. The jury deliberated for two hours before ruling that the school had acted illegally.</p>
        <p>Since the verdict, she has declined invitations to appear on ''Good Morning America,'' the Jay Leno Show and the David Letterman Show, and she has rejected the offer of a film producer to make ''The Heather Sue Mercer Story.''</p>
        <p>She has kept in touch with her high school coach, who was not surprised by the verdict.</p>
        <p>''I have to believe that if they would have handled the situation right, Heather would have been the first female in Division I to kick a field goal. Unfortunately, she was never given that opportunity, and for an athlete, that's like stealing a precious gift.''</p>
