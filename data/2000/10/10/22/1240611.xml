        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Andrew Santella's essay ''The Bad Boys of Summer'' (Oct. 1) accurately cited the book ''Ball Four,'' published 30 years ago, as the first of the tell-all baseball memoirs. Santella was also correct in saying that the ballplayer-author Jim Bouton offers much more than show and tell. But his assertion that the book demonstrates Bouton's abilities as a reporter, a keen observer and a recorder of detail is only half right.</p>
        <p>''Ball Four'' was a collaborative work. Bouton wrote the book with his editor, Leonard Shecter, the star sports columnist of The New York Post. While I was a reporter at United Press International, Shecter and I became friends. He told me that when he approached Bouton with the idea for a book, to his delight, Bouton pulled some notes out of his pocket and said, ''Just what I've been thinking.''</p>
