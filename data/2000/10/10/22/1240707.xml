        <p>To the Editor: In contrast to the unfortunate experiences of a traveler using a wheelchair described by Betsy Wade (''Cruise Ships and the Disabled,'' Aug. 6), we had a wonderful time recently on the Pacific Princess, the original ''Love Boat.''</p>
        <p>We had a honeymoon to remember in mid-August. From the moment we boarded the Pacific Princess in New York to our stay in Bermuda and the  voyage back home, the staff attended to our every need. Our cabin was perfectly accessible for my wheelchair. The bathroom door was easily wide enough, and the bathroom, which included a roll-in shower, had all the proper railings. We had more space to maneuver in our cabin than we do in most of the rooms in our home on Long Island.</p>

        <p>We had a honeymoon to remember in mid-August.

Our cabin was perfectly accessible for my wheelchair. The bathroom door was easily wide enough, and the bathroom, which included a roll-in shower, had all the proper railings.

        <p>Although there was one step to get into the formal Coral Dining Room, the waiters were quick to assist me down the step or in using a portable ramp.</p>
        <p>When we arrived back in New York Harbor, the staff treated us, along with the more than 20 other disabled travelers, as if we were family members, ensuring that each person not only got off the ship safely  but also was set with travel plans home.</p>
        <p>It was a glorious week we will always cherish.</p>
