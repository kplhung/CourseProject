        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today denounced a proposal by Governor George W. Bush to withdraw United States ground forces from their peacekeeping mission in the Balkans.</p>
        <p>In remarks by Mr. Gore during and after a campaign event in Washington, and in an unusual interview by Dr. Albright on a major political dispute between the presidential candidates, they painted the idea as risky and misguided and said it could lead to instability in the region and even, over time, to the possible dissolution of NATO.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush's proposal would be more than a major untested shift in America's foreign policy for the last half-century,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech at a union rally here. ''It would be one that could jeopardize fragile alliances. It would be a damaging blow to NATO.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Gore and Dr. Albright were denouncing a proposal put forth by Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's security adviser, that the United States should provide intelligence and logistics support for NATO peacekeepers in places like Kosovo and Bosnia, but should not keep troops there indefinitely. Indeed, Ms. Rice, in interviews with The New York Times that were published today, said a Bush administration would work to redeploy the 11,400 ground troops -- about one-fifth of the 65,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in the region -- out of the Balkans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice did say, however, that no such redeployment would take place without consultation with America's NATO allies.</p>
        <p>In an interview that Dr. Albright initiated as she prepared to depart for North Korea, she emphasized that even voicing the idea of an American pullout from peacekeeping in the Balkans could destabilize the region just as elections approach in Kosovo, Bosnia and Serbia.</p>
        <p>''I am secretary of state of the United States until noon on Jan. 20, and this is damaging to American foreign policy,'' Dr. Albright said in explaining why she was so eager to criticize Ms. Rice's idea.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice's comments, which the Bush campaign reiterated today, are perhaps the boldest remarks about international affairs in a campaign noticeably devoid of them. The remarks fleshed out Mr. Bush's repeated statements that American troops should not be used in peacekeeping missions and should instead concentrate their efforts on preparing to fight wars in places like the Persian Gulf and the Korean peninsula.</p>
        <p>Even as the Gore campaign and Clinton administration officials denigrated the Bush position, the Republican candidate's camp restated his support of Ms. Rice's idea.</p>
        <p>''One hundred percent,'' Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the Bush campaign, said when asked if Mr. Bush stood by his security adviser's remarks. ''The role of the United States military is not to be all things to all people. Governor Bush does not support an open-ended commitment to keep our troops as peacekeepers in the Balkans.''</p>
        <p>In a statement released by the Bush campaign today, Ms. Rice said: ''Vice President Gore seems to have a vision of an indefinite U.S. military deployment in the Balkans. He proved today that if he is elected, America's military will continue to be overdeployed, harming morale and re-enlistment rates, weakening our military's core mission.''</p>
        <p>The criticisms from Mr. Gore and the administration were determined and coordinated. Mr. Gore inserted the issue into his pre-arranged schedule, beginning his speech at the labor union rally with remarks about foreign affairs and following up with an interview with The New York Times. Mrs. Albright's staff arranged for her to call reporters, and Mr. Gore's chief foreign policy advisor, Leon Fuerth, scheduled a conference call for news organizations to rebut Ms. Rice's views.</p>
        <p>Gore campaign officials clearly believe that Ms. Rice's remarks provide them with an opening in the final weeks of the campaign to paint Mr. Bush as naive and inexperienced in foreign affairs and to argue that his policies would harm American interests abroad.</p>
        <p>''I believe it demonstrates a lack of judgment and a complete misunderstanding of history to think that America can simply walk away from security challenges on the European Continent, which is, after all, a core American interest in the world,'' Mr. Gore said of the Bush campaign proposal.</p>
        <p>In the interview after his speech, Mr. Gore said that withdrawing from the peacekeeping operation in the Balkans could cause a questioning of American leadership of NATO and that the lack of American leadership over time ''would lead to the collapse of NATO and eventually threaten the peace in Europe.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Gore seemed more focused on the future and the long-term implications on NATO of an American withdraw from the Balkans peacekeeping force, Dr. Albright concentrated on how floating what she called an ill-conceived idea would affect diplomatic affairs in the shorter term.</p>
        <p>Several times during her interview she remarked that local elections will be taking place in Kosovo on Oct. 28, in Bosnia on Nov. 11 and in Serbia in December. She said she feared that Ms. Rice's idea would give support to anti-democratic forces in each of those countries who may feel they just need to hold on until American troops leave.</p>
        <p>''Is this the time to be saying we're not sure we're going to stay there?'' she said.</p>
