        <p>WITH help from a tape of  ''This Old Man,'' the class was counting to 10. Brittney Wei held up her fingers, one by one, and sang: ''Yat, yi, saamsei, ng, luk.''</p>
        <p>Eight-year-old Brittney is among the 150 students, ages 4 to 13, who recently enrolled in Saturday classes at the Chinese Heritage School of New Jersey. Most are children of Americans who immigrated years ago. These weekly forays into the language of their forebears are meant to help the students remember their roots.</p>
        <p>They gather at Crossroads Middle School in South Brunswick in groups of up to 15, sorted according to age and linguistic expertise.</p>
        <p>There are several hundred such private, part-time Chinese schools, including more than 20 operating in New Jersey, most of which use the Mandarin dialect, widely spoken in mainland China and Taiwan. The Chinese Heritage School is one of the few that use the Cantonese dialect of southern China and Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>For $130 a semester, the children learn traditional dance, calligraphy and the martial arts in addition to the two hours of language instruction each week. Those with a more sophisticated command of Chinese are taught etiquette and values like honor and family.</p>
        <p>Brittney's father, George Wei, is president of the school's P.T.A. An independent businessman and former Air Force officer, Mr. Wei has been in the United States for 38 years and is married to an Italian-American.</p>
        <p>''I grew up in a Chinese neighborhood on the Upper East Side of New York,'' said Mr. Wei, who now lives in a suburb of North Brunswick. ''That sort of environment reinforces your heritage, because everywhere there are people like you, speaking a distinct language that is part of your background.</p>
        <p>''There is no Chinatown-type community where I live now, and we speak English at home,'' he said. ''By bringing our kids to this school we are re-establishing links to the culture they came from.''</p>
        <p>Started in September, the school is the brainchild of Cornwell and Pearl Mah, who arrived together in the United States in 1971.</p>
        <p>''Our two daughters' background is Chinese,'' said Pearl Mah, who teaches one of the 12 classes. ''We want them to get along in this country and still be able to talk with their grandparents in Hong Kong.''</p>
        <p>Cornwell Mah, the school's principal, said: ''The paradox for many people who successfully immigrate to the United States is that they want to assimilate into American culture, but deep inside is this urge to pass along to the next generation the philosophy and values with which they grew up. We want to teach what we know from our backgrounds to better our children, even as they become a part of the mainstream society here.''</p>
