        <p>For the first time in the world championship match, Garry Kasparov did not suffer with the black pieces, but let Vladimir Kramnik do the heavy lifting to get a draw. An innovation at Move 16, in a line he had played before against Kramnik, but with the White army, gave him a dynamic play that drove Kramnik into a careful cessation of hostilities.</p>
        <p>So, it was a moral victory for Kasparov. Yet on the scoreboard, it gave Kramnik another half-point, preserving his lead at 4 1/2-3 1/2 at the halfway mark. And that means that Kramnik can win the $1.33 million prize by holding draws in the last eight games.</p>

        <p>For the first time in the world championship match, Garry Kasparov did not suffer with the black pieces, but let Vladimir Kramnik do the heavy lifting to get a draw. An innovation at Move 16, in a line he had played before against Kramnik, but with the White army, gave him a dynamic play that drove Kramnik into a careful cessation of hostilities.</p>
        <p>So, it was a moral victory for Kasparov. Yet on the scoreboard, it gave Kramnik another half-point, preserving his lead at 4 1/2-3 1/2 at the halfway mark. And that means that Kramnik can win the $1.33 million prize by holding draws in the last eight games.</p>
        <p>Getting away from the Queen's Gambit Accepted of Games 4 and 6 and his Gruenfeld Defense of Game 2, Kasparov switches to the Nimzo-Indian Defense with the pinning 3 . . . Bb4 for this eighth game.</p>
        <p>Kramnik counters with the Classical Variation, 4 Qc2, preventing his being saddled with doubled pawns if Black captures with . . . Bc3. The white strategy features the obtaining of the bishop pair at the cost of a tempo with 5 a3 Bc3 6 Qc3.</p>
        <p>Through 16 e4, this game followed Kasparov-Kramnik, Moscow Blitz Match, Game 16, 1998, which proceeded 16 . . . Ne7?! 17 Ne2 Bc6 18 Ba6 b5 19 a4 ba 20 dc with advantage to White. But now Kasparov varies with the forcing 16 . . . Nc7!? 17 Bd7 Rd7 18 dc f5! Kramnik could not play 19 ef? because after 19 . . . ef 20 Ne2 Re8 White is helpless against 21 . . . Ba6. After 21 . . . Be4, Kramnik organized his position with 22 O-O, but Kasparov enjoyed superior piece activity with 22 . . . Rd2.</p>
        <p>After 24 . . . Rf8, Kramnik took no chances but got rid of the aggressive rook with 25 Ra2 Ra2 26 Na2. And after 26 . . . Nd5 27 Bd4 Ra8, he made no attempt to guard his a pawn, but saw to it that the enemy knight was eliminated after 28 Nc3 Nc3 29 Bc3 Ra3. With 31 Rf4, Kramnik was making a beeline for the position he sets up at Move 38, and Kasparov had no way to stop him.</p>
        <p>Kasparov cannot advance his two passed pawns. Thus, 38 . . . Kg6 39 Kd4 Kf5 40 Bd6 Kg4 41 Kf3 Kh3 42 Be5 g4 43 Kf2, and the e6 and g4 pawns will never take another step.</p>
        <p>Game 9 will begin today at 3 p.m. London time (10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time).</p>
