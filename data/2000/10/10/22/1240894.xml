        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding Dr. Barbara Kapetanakes's letter [''The Monumental Shift in Parental Roles,'' Oct. 8]:</p>
        <p>I share Dr. Kapetananake's concerns about societal trends that demonstrate shifts in parenting roles and creation of situations that discourage children from resolving problems and learning how to deal with negative feelings.</p>
        <p>However, I disagree with Dr. Kapetanakes's generalized portrayal of parents who use my services as taking the easy way out and avoiding parental responsibility and the opportunity to bond with their children. On the contrary, my personal experience with parents and children during a bike lesson demonstrates that parents are genuinely concerned about their children and do want to participate in meaningful activities with them.</p>
        <p>During a typical lesson at least one parent is always present in addition to younger or older siblings, often making the lesson a pleasant family experience. This scenario is far from the portrayal of leaving the child in the hands of a ''paid stranger.''</p>
        <p>A child who has a successful experience in mastering a skill, whether taught by a parent or a tutor, appears to have a greater chance of achieving other and more difficult milestones.</p>
