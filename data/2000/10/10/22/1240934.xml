        <p>In recent months, the university, which has several buildings in Greenwich Village, has unfurled more than a dozen of the 8-by-10-foot green flags on poles along Fifth Avenue between 11th and 14th Streets.

        <p>The color is somewhere between hunter green and emerald. And although it lacks a catchy name like, say, Dartmouth Green, it is the official color of the New School University.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the university, which has several buildings in Greenwich Village, has unfurled more than a dozen of the 8-by-10-foot green flags on poles along Fifth Avenue between 11th and 14th Streets. The new flags join several put up in the 1980's on Fifth Avenue and at the university's building at 66 West 12th Street. The new ones bear the university's Internet address.</p>
        <p>''They identify our buildings clearly and give people information about who we are and how to reach us,'' said Carmen Ashhurst, director of communications for the university, formerly known as the New School for Social Research. ''It also makes the area look brighter.''</p>
        <p>But people who live nearby say the flags detract from the neighborhood's character. ''They are trying to make this area their campus,'' said Gardner Rankin of 12th Street. ''It is promotion and advertising, and it doesn't belong in a residential area.''</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, said the flags were installed without the deparment's permission and that last month a notice to correct the situation was issued to the university. It must remove the flags or apply for a permit, he said.</p>
        <p>Lee Webb, the university's vice president for administration, said the old flags were installed with approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission because they are within the Greenwich Village Historic District. The new flags are outside landmark areas, he said, and ''had been done with the Buildings Department's approval.'' University officials plan to meet with Buildings Department officials to resolve the matter, he added.</p>
