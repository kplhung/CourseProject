        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You offer a compelling and sympathetic picture of women who immigrate to the United States based on marriage to an American citizen only to find themselves captive and abused (news article, Oct. 16). But there is another point of view.</p>
        <p>I have practiced immigration law for more than 20 years and have represented American men who marry foreign women in their home countries. In these cases, the husband spends significant sums of money on a dowry, medical bills and legal fees to bring his new wife to the United States. Once here, the loving wife becomes a harridan who reveals that she has achieved her goal -- obtaining a green card -- and leaves, claiming abuse.</p>

        <p>The husband, completely humiliated by this rejection, will not speak out about this miscarriage of justice. Therefore, the bride gets the green card; the husband gets nothing. As usual, there are two sides to every story.</p>
