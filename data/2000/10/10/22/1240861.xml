        <p>ALI BABA  ++  (212) 683-9206; 206 East 34th Street, between Second and Third Avenues; $; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>From outside its humble storefront near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, Ali Baba looks like another shabby pizza place. But inside is a trove of Turkish street snacks centering on freshly baked Turkish breads. Appetizers include eggplant salad with peppers, onion, parsley, fresh dill and lemon juice; and sigara borek, a light pastry dough stuffed with a blend of feta cheese and fresh herbs. Entrees include grilled marinated baby lamb chops; chicken breast sauteed with onions, green peppers, tomatoes and garlic in butter; and a variety of kebabs, including doner kebab, which is fresh ground lamb marinated with seasonings, cooked on a rotating spit and then thinly sliced.

        <p>CIBO  ++  (212) 681-1616; 767 Second Avenue, between 41st and 42nd Streets; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards; www.cibonyc.com.</p>
        <p>Cibo means food in Italian, so it is not surprising that the menu is a familiar Mediterranean blend of salads, pastas, grilled and roasted poultry and seafood. Current appetizers include soup of butternut squash, hazelnut, apple and roasted seckel pear; napoleon of foie gras, black mission fig and sweet onion marmalades; and Prince Edward Island mussels steamed in pinot gris, roasted garlic, fresh tomatoes, ginger and curry. Current entrees include seared basil-infused sea scallops, aromatic couscous and pancetta-wrapped asparagus; and sesame-crusted salmon, velvety lemon grass corn broth, jasmine rice and spinach. (Diner's Journal: 9/29/95)</p>
        <p>HANGAWI  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 213-0077; 12 East 32nd Street, between Madison and Fifth Avenues; $$$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>If you like to travel to exotic places, consider a trip to 32nd Street. A meal at Hangawi is an experience  for all the senses, a chance to escape, if only for a little while, the city's stress and bustle. Current appetizers include steamed tofu with shiitake mushrooms; vegetarian dumplings, steamed or fried; and mung bean pancakes. Main dishes include tofu with mixed vegetables in brown sauce; stuffed eggplant in mustard sauce; oyster mushrooms and vegetables on a stick; and fragrant bamboo rice. (Review: 3/31/95)</p>
        <p>MAVALLI PALACE  +  (212) 679-5535; 46 East 29th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Mavalli Palace excels at the lively, spicy vegetarian dishes of southern India, food that even the most dedicated of carnivores can enjoy. Current appetizers include lentil donuts served in garnished yogurt and mildly spiced crisp vegetable fritters. Entrees include mutter paneer, green peas and homemade cottage cheese in a mild gravy; masala dosai, which is a crepe filled with a melange of potatoes, peas and onions; and onion fritters cooked in a spicy yogurt sauce. ($25 and Under: 2/11/94; article: 9/22/00)</p>
        <p>TABLA  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 889-0667; 11 Madison Avenue, at 25th Street; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This sensuous restaurant is vibrant with color and pulsing with energy. This is American food, viewed through a kaleidoscope of Indian spices. Appetizers include tandoori shrimp with a tomato sorbet, ginger, frisee and baby greens; and Greenmarket heirloom tomatoes with chabbey cheese, black pepper, mint and ginger. Entrees include roasted veal chop with golden chanterelles, sweet corn, shrimp flakes and tarragon; rawa crisped skate with fricassee of baby vegetables; and Maine crabmeat-stuffed calamari and scallops, served with summer bean fricassee, peanuts and sambhar broth. (Review: 2/24/99)</p>
        <p>VATAN  +  (212) 689-5666; 409 Third Avenue, between 28th and 29th Streets; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Vatan specializes in the spicy yet subtle vegetarian cuisine of Gujarat, a state in western India north of Bombay. Current appetizers include deep-fried potato balls in a chickpea flour batter; sev puri, which is potatoes, garbanzo beans, yogurt and chutney in fried bread; and samosa, savory pastries filled with spicy potatoes and green peas. Main dishes include sauteed spinach and chickpeas cooked with onions and spices;  cauliflower and green peas cooked with mild sauce; and rice pudding with saffron and dry fruits in milk. After dinner, there is mango ice cream or Indian tea cooked with cardamom, ginger and milk. ($25 and Under: 6/28/96)</p>
