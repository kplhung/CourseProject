        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to Debra Galant's philosophical quandary about breaking the delicate subject of New Jersey residency to one's progeny (Jersey, Oct. 15), there is a cornucopia of  subjects to appropriately ridicule about New Jersey, but it's still a  jackpot of a place to live. Two of the state's citizenry's finest attributes are the ability to tell the truth and the ability to make fun of things, including itself. A drive on the turnpike does hurt the eyes and the nose, some of our neighbors do speak like lovable mobsters, and many residents mysteriously confuse the New Jersey seashore with the French Riviera, but the people are pleasant and charmingly sarcastic, the state gets scenic if you leave the highways, and the diversity of culture within the state is arguably unparalleled within this country.</p>

        <p>One needn't feel defensive in the least about being New Jerseyans simply because we're a geographical punching bag for nonresidents. Every place and every person gets made fun of sooner or later. Going with the punches is infinitely more New Jerseyan than climbing on board the governor's politically correct train toward a cultural vacuum whereby no one is allowed to make fun of anyone. Next time, tell the kids they live in a Jersey jackpot and to start writing jokes about their neighbors -- that's the New Jersey I grew up in.</p>
