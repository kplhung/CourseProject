        <p>Pelswick Eggert loves drawing cartoons, playing sports and drumming up trouble with his friends. He's smart, gutsy and can always find the perfect pointed barb with which to slay his adversaries.

        <p>Pelswick Eggert loves drawing cartoons, playing sports and drumming up trouble with his friends. He's smart, gutsy and can always find the perfect pointed barb with which to slay his adversaries. In other words, he is your typical 13-year-old boy- except for the fact that he is confined to a wheelchair and has limited use of his arms.</p>
        <p>''He's just a normal kid who wants to be treated like everyone else, and he's not afraid to go after what he wants,'' said John Callahan, the cartoonist and author who created ''Pelswick,'' a weekly animated series that has its premiere on Tuesday at 8 p.m. on Nickelodeon.</p>
        <p>Like his protagonist, Mr. Callahan is quadriplegic, the result of an automobile accident that left him paralyzed at 21.</p>
        <p>''Over the years, so many kids have come up to me and asked me about being in a wheelchair. Little questions like 'Do you sleep in a wheelchair?' 'Is your dog paralyzed?' '' he said. ''The best thing to do is to be straightforward.''</p>
        <p>Still, ''Pelswick is not that totally autobiographical,'' he insisted. ''He's a little removed from me.''</p>
        <p>With the support of his family, espeically his grandmother, Pelswick overcomes obstacles like being nominated for student body president against his wishes and dealing with his nemesis, Boyd Scullarzo, who focuses on ''psychological torture and humiliation.''</p>
        <p>All of which is fuel for Mr. Callahan's fire. ''There are just so many ideas,'' he said. ''I can't show them all in 13 episodes.''</p>
        <p>Even though adults at many of the networks he approached about ''Pelswick'' flinched when faced with its subject matter, Mr. Callahan thinks the show's intended audience gets his point.</p>
        <p>''I remember one of the comments made by a kid who had seen an episode,'' he recalled. ''He said, 'I like Pelswick because he's in a wheel-chair and doesn't care.' He was right.''</p>
