        <p>Faced with news reports that New Jersey law enforcement officials may have concealed evidence of racial profiling for nearly three years, state legislators have called for investigations of who knew what and  when. One focus will be former Attorney General Peter Verniero, now a state Supreme Court justice. During his confirmation hearings in May 1999, Mr. Verniero said he had no solid evidence that troopers discriminated against minority drivers until his office conducted its own investigation in early 1999. But state police memos from the fall of 1996 show that police commanders had detailed data  showing that minorities were disproportionately stopped and searched by the State Police. Another memo indicates that Mr. Verniero was at a January 1997 meeting in which State Police commanders decided to limit what data they would turn over to investigators from the federal Justice Department.</p>
