        <p>Sometime before the end of the year, a milestone in American capitalism will pass. Wal-Mart Stores' annual sales are on track to exceed those of General Motors, the largest American company for much of the last half-century.</p>
        <p>Soaring oil prices will help Exxon Mobil edge Wal-Mart out of the top slot this year, but oil companies' fortunes routinely rise and fall with the state of affairs in the Middle East. In contrast, Wal-Mart's relentless and rapid rise is transforming whole industries, from consumer manufacturing to retailing and food processing and sales. Indeed, its reach is now so broad that Wal-Mart is lending extra momentum to important elements of the new economy, including the globalization of manufacturing and the use of technology to achieve productivity gains.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart did not seem a likely heavyweight in 1962, the year Sam Walton opened his first store in Rogers, Ark., with a sign saying ''Wal-Mart Discount City. We sell for less.'' But the retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., has built a nearly $200-billion-a-year empire by selling astonishing quantities of all manner of items from lawn mowers to toilet paper.</p>
        <p>Total annual retail spending in America, excluding automobiles and boats, is roughly $2.3 trillion. Wal-Mart's domestic sales for the fiscal year ended in January were $142 billion, or 6.2 percent of the total. To put it another way, Wal-Mart sells 19 million pairs of women's jeans a year and an average of 19,634 pairs of shoes an hour.</p>
        <p>In keeping with its founder's determinedly humble and press-shy persona, Wal-Mart has no plans to celebrate its ascendancy. ''We don't keep track,'' Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's chief executive, said. Still, as Mr. Scott admits, the company has been a force behind ''driving unnecessary costs out of businesses.''</p>
        <p>That is an understatement. To keep its prices low, Wal-Mart is always pushing its suppliers, an army of more than 65,000 companies, to become leaner machines that examine every penny they spend.</p>
        <p>This ruthless drive to cut fat has clearly reshaped the practices of both businesses that have worked with Wal-Mart and those that compete against it. The Wal-Mart hallmarks for keeping costs down -- the use of cutting-edge technology, masterful logistics, reliance on imported goods and a nonunion work force -- are becoming industry standards.</p>
        <p>Those retailers that have failed to keep up have suffered. Wal-Mart's potentially devastating effect on mom-and-pop businesses has been widely reported, but many in the industry argue that Wal-Mart is now large enough that it is also driving midsize to large players out of business and speeding consolidation among others. (Philip Morris's decision to merge the food giants Kraft and Nabisco into one entity, for example, was seen by many as a way to increase its leverage with retailing giants.)</p>
        <p>And while Wal-Mart's business practices are greatly emulated, they are often controversial. As Wal-Mart accelerates its drive to open stores abroad, local groups have formed to protest the company's practices. Labor advocates say overseas factories that supply Wal-Mart are routinely among those with the worst working conditions. In addition, as Wal-Mart begins to compete with American businesses that are mostly unionized, labor unions, their members and some local government agencies are arguing that the company is big enough to exert downward pressure on benefits and wages across whole regions of the country.</p>
        <p>''If you are an admirer of capitalism, they are the epitome of it,'' said Carl Steidtmann, an economist with PricewaterhouseCoopers who studies retailing. ''They are the prime example for the good and bad.''</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart is considered so efficient that executives at retailers from Bloomingdale's to Banana Republic openly admire it. Less direct homage is paid every day by competitors. When Charles Conaway, the new chief executive of Kmart, announced last summer that his first major move with the company would be to spend $460 million to upgrade information systems, he was tipping his hat to Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>Doing business the Wal-Mart way means constantly figuring out how to cut costs. Some manufacturers say that Wal-Mart is heavy-handed in pressing suppliers on details of their operations, like the location of their corporate offices. (Wal-Mart, located in out-of-the-way Bentonville, hates high urban rents.) One corporate executive, who asked not to be named, tells of a vendor summit meeting called by David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive until January of this year, where the attending executives were chastised for flying in on private jets. (At the time, Bentonville had limited direct airline service.) Wal-Mart officials, asked about the story, said the company did not discuss meetings with vendors.</p>
        <p>But most suppliers say the real pressure arises when Wal-Mart demands a particularly low wholesale price. They say the chain does not care how a supplier meets its demands. Many argue that doing business with Wal-Mart is a good thing, a trial by fire. ''I went there knowing we were going to get squeezed and wrung and twisted -- all in positive ways,'' said Paul R. Charron, chief executive of Liz Claiborne Inc., which designs the Russ clothing brand especially for Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>For the Wal-Mart account, Mr. Charron built a separate staff with offices outside New York. He employs fewer people there than he does for servicing department stores and relies heavily on technology, which he calls ''faster, quicker and cheaper when optimized.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Charron's staff still finds itself in frequent discussions with Wal-Mart over costs, even very small ones. ''They will ask if that zipper is right, or does that piece of lace trim add value,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Charron says that the lessons from Wal-Mart have made Claiborne a tighter ship.</p>
        <p>Hal J. Upbin, chief executive of the Kellwood Company, an apparel manufacturer that does about $200 million in annual business with Wal-Mart, concurs. ''They are tough,'' Mr. Upbin said. ''They want the lowest prices, and it requires a lot of creativity and ingenuity on our part'' to meet Wal-Mart's needs.</p>
        <p>Whether Wal-Mart's demands cross the line from the obsessive to the crushing is a subject of hot debate among suppliers. But Wal-Mart's purchasing power is so great that none of its trading partners were willing to go on the record saying negative things about it.</p>
        <p>Still, it is not hard to find companies whose bottom lines have been wounded by the retailer. In the 1990's, Rubbermaid was the leading brand-name maker of common kitchenware and household items like laundry baskets. But when the price for the main component in its products, resin, more than tripled between 1994 and 1996, Wal-Mart balked at paying increased prices.</p>
        <p>When Rubbermaid insisted, Wal-Mart relegated the manufacturer's items to undesirable shelf space and used its market power to promote a Rubbermaid rival, Sterilite, which made lower-priced nonresin products. Profit margins fell substantially at Rubbermaid, and it has since been bought by another household goods giant, Newell.</p>
        <p>Neither Wal-Mart nor Newell Rubbermaid would comment on their relationship.</p>
        <p>Still, while companies complain, many economists, market analysts and even government regulators see as something bordering on heroic the Wal-Mart effort to use its formidable market share to start its own brands and to break up monopolies in price-inflated categories.</p>
        <p>''They have done more than Alan Greenspan to lower prices,'' said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of Reaching Marketing, a consulting firm in Westport, Conn., that frequently works for the Federal Trade Commission. ''In the case of vitamins, pet food and baby formula, they have broken the half-nelson'' of the dominant companies.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, for example, seven companies controlled 90 percent of the market for multivitamins. Last year, a federal judge approved a settlement in which all seven pleaded guilty to charges of price collusion. But Wal-Mart changed the landscape in that business in just 15 months. It introduced its own product, called One Source, in 1997, and it is now among the top-selling multivitamins in the United States.</p>
        <p>While economists wax ecstatic about Wal-Mart's effect on domestic consumer prices, the company has become a target of labor activists.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart discontinued its once heavily advertised ''Buy America'' program, which contained a pledge to use domestic suppliers wherever possible, in 1998 in tacit recognition of its dependence on foreign suppliers. But Wal-Mart has been caught numerous times having subcontracted work to vendors operating under abusive conditions.</p>
        <p>''In country after country, factories that produce Wal-Mart goods are the worst,'' said Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee. ''They will cut every single corner available.'' The National Labor Committee, a nonprofit group that addresses concerns of global workers, was instrumental in exposing the fact that sweatshop workers were making products for Wal-Mart's Kathie Lee Gifford clothing line.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart vigorously disputes those charges, saying it has a strict code of ethics and that it cuts off contractors who violate them. ''There will always be people who break the law,'' said Mr. Scott, who argues that most Wal-Mart manufacturers provide decent working conditions.</p>
        <p>As the largest private employer here at home, with more than one million full-time and part-time employees, Wal-Mart's rabidly antiunion stance is increasingly making the retailer a lightning rod for many labor disputes, particularly over health benefits. Take the example of food workers. In 1987, Wal-Mart started selling groceries, and it is now closing in on a stunning 10 percent share of grocery-chain sales.</p>
        <p>Most food workers in this country are unionized, however. And with labor accounting for roughly 60 percent of most grocery companies' fixed costs, differences in pay scales can be deadly. Nearly a dozen regional grocery chains have folded in the last five years. The big players say they are going to have to match Wal-Mart on wages and benefits to survive. ''When a competitor comes in, you have to mimic their operations, and you get reduced to the lowest common denominators,'' an executive at a competing grocery chain said.</p>
        <p>Jay Allen, a Wal-Mart spokesman, disputed that contention. ''It defies logic that we attract that kind of work force, especially in a low-unemployment time, if we are not paying competitive wage and benefits.'' Mr. Allen said.</p>
        <p>More broadly, Wal-Mart argues that it has lifted the quality of life for thousands of employees by giving them access to stock options and by promoting aggressively from within.</p>
        <p>The company also says it has made life better for middle-income Americans in general.</p>
        <p>''We have, in fact, raised the standard of living for the working person,'' Mr. Scott said. ''Driving inflated profits out of doing business has been good for the person who works hard every day, and that will be our lasting impact.''</p>
