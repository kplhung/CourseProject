''Basically, it came down to experience,'' Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>The Mets went with the same players who won the National League Championship Series, 15 position players and 10 pitchers. The only question had been the status of reliever Dennis Cook, who had been bothered by kidney stones. Reliever Pat Mahomes was left off for the third postseason series in a row.</p>
