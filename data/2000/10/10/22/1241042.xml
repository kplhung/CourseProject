        <p>In less than three hours beginning late Friday night, five people were killed in unrelated incidents in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Four of the killings occurred over the course of just 90 minutes, the police said. Two women were charged after the incidents: one with killing her live-in boyfriend, another with killing her husband.</p>
        <p>Police officials acknowledged that five slayings in three hours was unusual, but they pointed out that while the murder rate was up slightly at the end of last year, it has steadily declined for seven years and has been down this year since August.</p>
        <p>''It was a violent night, but just a blip,'' said Deputy Chief Tom Fahey, a Police Department spokesman. ''Homicides cannot be measured on a daily basis. You have to examine the year-to-year changes, and through the week of Oct. 15, homicides were down almost 66 percent from seven years ago.''</p>
        <p>In the first case, Wallace McDuffie, 55, a Postal Service worker, was found dead about 10:20 p.m. in his apartment at 2420 Morris Avenue in the University Heights section of the Bronx, said Sgt. James Foley, a police spokesman. Mr. McDuffie had been shot once in the back of the head.</p>
        <p>About an hour later, Paul Bagnall, 40, was stabbed in the chest inside his home at 112-09 202nd Street in St. Albans, Queens. He died at Mary Immaculate Hospital. His wife, Vanessa Bagnall, 39, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
        <p>Less than 10 minutes later, about 10 miles away, William Carlson, 41, was stabbed in the chest inside his apartment on Amsterdam Avenue in Washington Heights, Manhattan. He was pronounced dead at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.</p>
        <p>The woman Mr. Carlson lived with, Kenia Belez, 27, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and weapons possession, said Detective Carolyn Chew, a police spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Few details were available in the fourth case, but the police said a man was found dead in a ground-floor apartment on Bushwick Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn, at 11:47 p.m. He had been shot in the neck, the police said.</p>
        <p>At 12:50 a.m. yesterday, Arvil Cordova, 16, was shot and killed in the lobby of 3673 Third Avenue in the Tremont section of the Bronx. The police said he had been shot twice in the head and his killer had fled.</p>
