        <p>Don't take this as a confession, an apology or a boast. It is barely a disclosure. It is a fact so simple, so obvious, so in character, that it bears declaration only because of this feverish moment in the life of the city.</p>
        <p>I am a Yankee fan.</p>
        <p>I have always been a Yankee fan. I have never understood how anyone could root for any other baseball team.</p>
        <p>I can understand rooting for individual players, for becoming besotted with cranky geniuses like Ted Williams or Willie Mays; with reveling in the home-run summer of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa; with arguing all night over whether A-Rod or Nomar is the future.</p>
        <p>But becoming emotionally involved with the Red Sox? The Cubs? The Braves or the Dodgers? The Mets? Get a therapist.</p>
        <p>The only way to justify even rooting for any team other than the Yankees is to make some profound yet sentimental point about a childhood sense of place.</p>
        <p>Growing up in St. Louis, the fine hot red-clay dust of summer in your eyes as you watched Stan Musial's corkscrew stance at the plate is acceptable. Learning to drink beer and curse fate with Grandpa and his useless cronies in the bleachers at Wrigley Field. Sure. Driving from the oil patch with Dad to fight the mosquitoes at Houston's first major league park to watch the Colt .45s. Go for it.</p>
        <p>But if you grew up in New York, except maybe for certain remote neighborhoods in Brooklyn, there can be no choice. Baseball is about winning, about playing with the best, about being part of a group that gives you a positive identity, so at odds with your reality.</p>
        <p>My own path to enlightenment has been banal. Being born in the Bronx, near the Stadium, was a head start. Being raised in Queens at a time when one could choose among three local teams without fearing Bud Lightweights was a blessing. We had Giants fans -- precious stat hounds who grew up to be Rotisserie League owners; and we had Dodger fans -- Uriah Heeps refining their facade of tolerant goodness, and the scattering of jokesters who talked about the St. Louis Browns or the Cleveland Indians. But the class of the class lived in the mind-set that Ruth built.</p>
        <p>The Yankees lover as elitist snob or rich front-runner is a straw fan. It was never an exclusive club, no Fortune 500, no Skull &amp; Bones, no Mensa. Everyone was welcome. You didn't have to be cool or nice or rational or humane. Mayor Giuliani is a Yankee fan.</p>
        <p>There are dumb Yankee fans, to be sure, pigs and jerks who care as much about the team as you do and still throw up on your children at the Stadium. It's part of the greater lesson of life; go earn more money so you can afford better seats.</p>
        <p>Which leads us to money, of course. Bloated payrolls and hiring bat-slingers and samurai pitchers have always been in the Yankee tradition. In the major leagues of this society, money is a number on the scoreboard. You want to root for a team like the San Diego Padres which holds fire sales of players? Cheap little markets like Milwaukee? Why didn't they make themselves into major metro areas when they had the chance?</p>
        <p>Disliking George Steinbrenner is no excuse for not rooting for the one true team. The only owners I ever enjoyed drinking with -- Bill Veeck and Marge Schott -- were run out of the game. Steinbrenner has proven himself a Yankee, clawing up from such disasters as his father's sinking shipbuilding company and Nixon's re-election campaign to make a fortune on his baseball investment and use some of that money to buy us World Series appearances. Think Roger Clemens, David Justice.</p>
        <p>It's not as if I haven't flirted with the Mets, although it was more professional than personal. I covered their first spring training, some early games at the Polo Grounds and their 1969 and 1986 championships. While I appreciated the Mets' shock of the ridiculous, I missed the Yankee thrill of the sublime.</p>
        <p>And don't forget that the most famous early Mets were Casey Stengel and Marv Throneberry, two cast-off Yankees who would have been happy to drop the Mets from their resumes. Among the most famous older Mets were David Cone, Darryl Strawberry, Joe Torre and Doc Gooden, who should all be grateful for having ended up as Yankees.</p>
        <p>Like most true Yankee fans (just because they stomp and holler now, get their eyes fixed at Bernie Williams's laser surgeon or eat Derek Jeter's frosted flakes, not all Yankee fans are as true as I am), as much as we want to win, we don't have to win. We are not afraid of losing. We know we will be back.</p>
        <p>And if we have to lose, who better to lose to than the Mets, whose fans so desperately need this pathetic affirmation that they have some brief value in a world they can never own.</p>
