        <p>What looks like a bowling shoe, has influenced Prada and is walking out of a new SoHo store on some of the hippest feet downtown? It's the Camper shoe, a Spanish brand whose retro athletic look has been spotted on the dogs of Hilary Swank, Kim Hastreiter of Paper magazine and DJ Spooky. The drawstring closures with little toggles that started appearing on Prada shoes a few seasons ago were first used by Camper in the 1970's. Another Camper signature -- a rubber athletic sole combined with a stylish leather upper -- seems to have inspired Louis Vuitton and Hermes.</p>

        <p>''I wouldn't say they copy us 100 percent, but there is a visible comparison to the things they are doing now which we were doing years ago,'' Dalia Saliamonas, the director of Camper's export division, said. The most popular styles, Pelotas (right), are $120 to $180, available at the six-month-old Camper store at 125 Prince Street, near Wooster Street, in SoHo, and also at Agnes B. and Barneys New York.</p>
