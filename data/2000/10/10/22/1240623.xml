        <p>Every year more than 500,000 people visit Auschwitz-Birkenau, where over one million Jews were killed between 1940 and 1945. Few, however, cross the Sola River to the nearby town of Oswiecim (pronounced ohsh-vee-EN-tseem), which in 1939 was a bustling Polish community of roughly 12,000 people, most of them Jewish. Only one Oswiecim synagogue, the Chevra Lomdei Mishnayot, survived the war, having first been used as a Nazi munitions depot and then as a carpet warehouse under the Communist regime.</p>
        <p>Last month this turn-of-the-century synagogue, along with the adjoining residence, reopened as the Auschwitz Jewish Center (Zydowskie Centrum Edukacyjne), the culmination of a $1 million reconstruction effort led by the New York-based Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation to create a site for prayer, education and contemplation.</p>
        <p>The center features a permanent exhibit about the prewar Jewish population of Oswiecim, as well as a 15-minute video of testimony from survivors and former residents interviewed by the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a project of Steven Spielberg.</p>
        <p>A genealogy resource office is also available. Prayer meetings may be organized in the synagogue.</p>
        <p>The Auschwitz Jewish Center, Plac Ks Jana Skarbka 5, (48-33) 844-7002, is about two miles from the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum. Closed Saturday and after</p>
        <p>2 on Friday afternoons between Nov. 1 and Feb. 28, unless arrangements have been made in advance. No admission charge. Information about group visits at (212) 575-1050, www.ajcf.org on the Web or by e-mail to info@ajcf.org.</p>
