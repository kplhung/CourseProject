        <p>Army avoided a record 11th straight defeat today when quarterback Joe Gerena fired an 18-yard touchdown pass to tight end Clint Dodson with 40 seconds left to lift the Black Knights to a 21-17 victory over Tulane.</p>
        <p>That touchdown pass capped an 80-yard drive during which Gerena twice completed fourth-down passes. The second fourth-down completion was for 24 yards to tailback Michael Wallace on fourth-and-11 at the Tulane 42-yard line with less than a minute to play. Gerena eluded the grasp of two Tulane defenders before throwing the ball as he ran to his left. On the next play, he found Dodson open in the left corner of the end zone for the final touchdown.</p>

        <p>Army avoided a record 11th straight defeat today when quarterback Joe Gerena fired an 18-yard touchdown pass to tight end Clint Dodson with 40 seconds left to lift the Black Knights to a 21-17 victory over Tulane.</p>
        <p>That touchdown pass capped an 80-yard drive during which Gerena twice completed fourth-down passes. The second fourth-down completion was for 24 yards to tailback Michael Wallace on fourth-and-11 at the Tulane 42-yard line with less than a minute to play. Gerena eluded the grasp of two Tulane defenders before throwing the ball as he ran to his left. On the next play, he found Dodson open in the left corner of the end zone for the final touchdown.</p>
        <p>Gerena said he had no desire to maneuver Army into field-goal position on the winning drive. ''I was thinking touchdown all the way,'' Gerena said. ''We were not playing for 3.</p>
        <p>''It's funny but we've been having trouble converting third-down situations in practice, but we did it today when it counted.''</p>
        <p>With time running out, Tulane (3-4) reached Army's 45-yard line. But two long passes by quarterback Patrick Ramsey were broken up by Army defenders just short of the Black Knights' end zone as the clock ran out.</p>
        <p>Todd Berry, Army's first-year coach, was exultant after the victory. ''We obviously got the two-minute drill down to where it was very well executed,'' he said. ''We faked the screen and they were locked up man-to-man.''</p>
        <p>The victory was Army's first since the Black Knights defeated New Mexico last Oct. 23. Army lost its last four games of the 1999 season and the first six games of this season.</p>
        <p>Besides connecting on the two fourth-down passes during Army's winning drive, Gerena, a senior, finished with 21 completions in 34 attempts for 171 yards.</p>
        <p>Ramsey, who threw for 447 yards in Tulane's 48-28 victory over Army a year ago, registered only 170 yards in the air as he completed 14 of 26 passes, one for Tulane's first touchdown in the second quarter, which gave the Green Wave a 10-7 halftime lead.</p>
        <p>Ramsey, a junior, shared quarterback duties this afternoon with his backup, the more mobile freshman J. P. Losman, who hit on 9 of 17 passes for 98 yards and Tulane's second touchdown, which gave the visitors a 17-14 lead with 11 minutes 10 seconds remaining in a game. Losman also led Tulane in rushing, gaining 82 yards in 13 carries for a 6.3-yard average as the Green Wave fell to 3-4 and 1-3 in Conference USA. Army is 1-6 over all, 1-4 in the conference.</p>
        <p>Army squandered repeated chances to score. The Black Knights got to Tulane's 23-yard line on their first possession but came away empty when Wallace was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1.</p>
        <p>Army also got inside Tulane territory six other times -- as close as the 24- and 30-yard lines -- without scoring.</p>
        <p>But Wallace atoned for his inability to get that needed yard when he bolted through the right side and raced 95 yards untouched for the first score of the game, just under 10 minutes after the opening kickoff.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Black Knights continue to draw capacity or near-capacity crowds at Michie Stadium, including Saturday's audience of 40,107. Among the attractions are the pregame parade of cadets on the Plain in the heart of the United States Military Academy campus and the Army skydivers, who almost unfailingly land close to the 50-yard line, the last one cradling the game ball, followed by one of the most colorful halftime shows at any college stadium. . . . Reflecting the diluted caliber of some bowl games, four teams from Conference USA, not one of the stronger conferences in the country, will be invited to bowl games this year. The conference winner will go to the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, and the second-, third- and fourth-place teams will go to the GMAC Mobile Alabama Bowl, the new Gallery Furniture.Com Bowl in Houston or the Motor City Bowl in Pontiac, Mich. . . . Army's next game will be Nov. 4 against Air Force at Michie Stadium.</p>
