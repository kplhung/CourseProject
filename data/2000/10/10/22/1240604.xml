        <p>HAPPINESS, DEATH, AND THE REMAINDER OF LIFE</p>
        <p>By Jonathan Lear.</p>
        <p>189 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:</p>

        <p>Philosophy and psychoanalysis are related as fusion is to fission. Philosophers seek commonalities, psychoanalysts idiosyncrasies. Ever since Plato, philosophers have been trying to answer the question ''What is a good life for a human being?'' This question presupposes that one size fits all -- that we all have the same built-in mechanism (''reason,'' ''human nature'') that steers us toward the same goal. We are all here for the same purpose. Philosophy will help us understand what that purpose is. It will do so by turning us away from appearance toward reality -- from the way the world looks from some merely subjective point of view to the way it objectively is, and thus from what merely seems good to what truly is good.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Lear, who is both a professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago and a psychoanalyst, started out as a commentator on Plato and Aristotle, but soon became fascinated by Freud. Freud tells us that each of us is steered through life by a different mechanism, a unique set of quirky, largely unconscious fantasies. These fantasies were installed in us early on as a result of the interaction of our genes with our infantile experiences, our family circumstances and the like. They determine what each of us will count as a happy, fulfilling life.</p>
        <p>Lear has spent much of his intellectual career trying to cope with the tension between Plato and Aristotle's claim that some goals are natural to human beings and Freud's doubt that we can rank the lives of the foot fetishist, the gold-hoarding miser, the self-flagellating penitent, the pedophile, the Socratic lover of wisdom, the Romantic poet and the would-be ruler of the world in terms of greater or less naturalness. Freud can of course grant that society must step in to prevent the realization of some of these goals (the pedophile's and the would-be ruler's, for example). But apart from social utility, there is little room in Freud's thinking for an objective, neutral, fantasy-free point of view from which the pedophile's, the penitent's and the philosopher's goals can be hierarchically ordered.</p>
        <p>This deep difference between a Platonic or Aristotelian and a Freudian outlook is concealed by the fact that Freud had fantasies of being a hardheaded scientist seeking objective truth, and also by his claim that psychoanalysis can get patients back in touch with reality. But the reality in question is not Plato's ''really real.'' Once social utility is put aside, the reality in question is just whatever the patient had better believe in to avoid getting locked up, or to become a little less unhappy. For all these reasons, not many people are equally appreciative of Plato and Freud, and fewer still are able to move back and forth between contemporary discussions among philosophers and the highly technical literature of psychoanalysis as easily as Lear does -- an ease that was evident in his much-admired collection of essays ''Open Minded,'' published two years ago.</p>
        <p>Lear's new book, ''Happiness, Death, and the Remainder of Life,'' is much more daring and provocative than its predecessor. In its brilliant last chapter Lear comes down firmly, indeed enthusiastically, in favor of Freud and against Plato. That chapter centers on the ''myth of the cave'' -- Plato's story, told in his ''Republic,'' of how the use of reason can free us from the shackles that keep us in the dark cave of the world of appearance, a cave in which we can only watch shadows pass along a screen, and can lead us out into the true world, where objects are seen as they really are, irradiated by the light that streams from what Plato called the Good. This story of movement upward toward the light, culminating in a gloriously unified vision of the whole, was elaborated upon by Augustine, Spinoza and Hegel. It has become the central metaphor -- the central fantasy -- of Western philosophy.</p>
        <p>In Lear's account, Freud fell in with this fantasy ''until the moment that he wrote 'Beyond the Pleasure Principle,' ''but ''from the perspective of 'Beyond the Pleasure Principle,' the metaphor of the cave gives a false picture of the totality of human possibilities.'' For Freud in his last period helped us see that ''the entire metaphor of the cave . . . is one more constrained vision'' of that totality. By abandoning that metaphor, Lear says, Freud achieved ''a deep rejection . . . of the teleological understanding of human being.'' He let us see that any supposed limit on the range of human possibilities, any religious or philosophical context within which we might hope to put the entire range of possible human lives, any all-encompassing goal for human beings as such, will always be a projection of some particular choice among those possibilities, a working out of one particular fantasy, a picture of human existence drawn from one particular perspective.</p>
        <p>The lesson Lear draws from Freud's achievement is not Sartre's ''man is a futile passion,'' but something more like Nietzsche's joyful realization that the horizon will move whenever we do, that there will be a context beyond every context, a perspective that transcends any previous perspective. Yet both Nietzsche and Lear would admit that this very picture of endless expansion is itself being drawn from one particular perspective, embodies one particular fantasy and can make no claim to represent the one true goal of human life.</p>
        <p>Lear goes beyond Freud in various ways, ways that Nietzsche would have happily endorsed. He writes, for example, that ''if one sees civilization as itself on a developmental path that runs Judaism, Christianity, psychoanalysis . . . , then one will of course see psychoanalysis as inheriting the problems of its forebears. But this is what it is for psychoanalysis to get trapped in an Oedipal fantasy of its own. . . . If Judaism is the father and Christianity the mother, how can I find my place? The right response is not -- as Freud did -- to try to answer this question, but to break with the fantasy that prompts it. Give up the fantasy that civilization has a developmental structure.'' Just as we should give up on the idea that reflection will reveal a goal that is set before us all, so we should give up on the idea that our civilization, or our species, is following a path that has somehow been traced out in advance. We must give up teleology both in the small and in the large.</p>
        <p>In this passage and many others, Lear is critical of many of Freud's later, weirder ideas. He does not think that ''death instinct'' is a good name for the urge that drives us to traduce and transcend every proffered vision of the good, and he does not agree with Freud that snowballing aggression will inevitably bring about the collapse of civilization. Aggression, he argues, is not the product of a special drive. Rather, it ''emerges from a breakdown in the mind's efforts to make meaning,'' from the inability of fantasy to hold everything together, without remainder. Such a breakdown may be ''an occasion for aggression, but it may also be an occasion for creativity and growth. It may also occasion nothing at all, just a momentary interruption in the ordinary flow of mental activity.'' The result of such a ''break,'' he continues, may be descent into permanent psychosis, or conversion to religion or to atheism, or the beginning of successful psychoanalytic treatment, or the construction of a new philosophical system, or just a hiccup in the daily grind.</p>
        <p>Lear's very original and fruitful way of bringing philosophy and psychoanalysis together is by way of an analogy between the failure of the philosopher's descriptions of human nature to include all human possibilities and the failure of the analysand's fantasy to keep at bay everything he or she would rather not know. Just as the sort of absolute and incorrigible vision of the whole that Plato wanted will never be had, so there will never be what Lear calls ''the person of psychological wisdom,'' the one who has achieved ''absolute psychical normality.'' That there can be no such person, he says, ''is not, contra Freud, a limitation of psychoanalysis so much as it is a celebration of human possibility.''</p>
        <p>Lear's book is, unfortunately, a bit slow in getting off the ground. It begins with a rather contrived, albeit imaginative, reading of Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics'' -- a book that only philosophy professors can love. But prospective readers should be put off neither by Lear's baffling title nor by his zigzag route to his final chapter, the site of the encounter between Plato and Freud. His staging of that encounter is admirable, and his book will excite the interest of anyone who has ever been bowled over by either of those two men.</p>
