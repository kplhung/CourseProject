        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Funny. Just when I'm thinking that ''Law and Order'' is getting better and better, Wendy Lesser writes that she thinks it's getting worse and worse [''It May Be Timely, but It's Way Past Its Prime,'' Oct. 1]. I see it often and sometimes catch reruns. Most of those early shows seem more obviously melodramatic. More people got excited more often. The scripts have always been intelligent and relevant, but nowadays there's more realism. And the current cast is so believable, so truthful in their roles and, especially, so subtle in their reactions. Some of the early regulars were just fine, and today some of the newcomers to the cast need a little tolerance while they're growing into their roles. But it would be tough to find better work than that done by Jerry Orbach, S. Epatha Merkerson, Sam Waterston and, for that matter, the folks behind the camera.</p>
