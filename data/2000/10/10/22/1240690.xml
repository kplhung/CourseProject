        <p>ESSAYS and reviews by Vincent Canby, who died on Oct. 15, appeared in The New York Times for more than 35 years. His style of commentary on film and theater was unadorned, direct and witty. Following are excerpts from his work that appeared in Arts and Leisure:</p>
        <p>FILM  On Violence: Jan. 16, 1972</p>
        <p>First off, it seems to me, that when we talk about movie violence, we are actually talking about two different kinds of movies, although they do overlap. We are talking about movies that exploit the excitement and pleasure experienced in the pain of witnessing violence effected by, or received by, a surrogate on the screen. We are also talking about movies that seriously attempt to analyze the meaning of violence and the social climate that tolerates it. Peckinpah's ''The Wild Bunch'' and, to a lesser extent, his ''Straw Dogs,'' are among the better examples of the former, while ''A Clockwork Orange'' is a superlative example of the latter.</p>

        <p>FILM  On Violence: Jan. 16, 1972</p>
        <p>First off, it seems to me, that when we talk about movie violence, we are actually talking about two different kinds of movies, although they do overlap. We are talking about movies that exploit the excitement and pleasure experienced in the pain of witnessing violence effected by, or received by, a surrogate on the screen.

Peckinpah's ''The Wild Bunch'' and, to a lesser extent, his ''Straw Dogs,'' are among the better examples of the former, while ''A Clockwork Orange'' is a superlative example of the latter.</p>
        <p>It may be about time for the movies to realize that they aren't realistic. They are, for all the reality of their locales and of their actors and of their circumstances, only representations of reality and nothing more. By showing us how a man looks when his head is chopped off, a movie can capture our shocked attention for a second or two, but it has said very little about the nature of man we didn't already know, and absolutely nothing about the nature of the poor man who was the victim -- except that he died, violently.</p>
        <p>The Good but Unimportant: Sept. 23, 1973</p>
        <p>In view of the tremendous competition for our attention, one is hard put to defend good-but-unimportant films. Seeing them will not change our lives, but (according to my definition) they have wit, style, even some ideas, though the ideas needn't be brand new. They never insult the intelligence, either ours or those of the filmmakers.</p>
        <p>The Neither Bad nor Good: March 16, 1975</p>
        <p>Bad movies by ambitious no-talents are easy to write about, either with pious indignation and outrage or with venom of the sort that always sells more papers than affection ever did. The most difficult films to criticize are the ambitious movies that fail in parts, that are neither bad nor good, neither smash hits or dismal flops, in spite of the intelligence and talents of the people involved. It's especially tough if you think you see evidence of the talent and intelligence throughout the particular film.</p>
        <p>And the Plain Mediocre: Oct. 14, 1979</p>
        <p>The mediocre film explains everything twice and always means exactly what it says. It waves sincerity aloft like a truce flag. It leaves no questions unanswered. It tells you exactly where you should stand in relation to its characters and its subject matter. It is frequently soothing because it tells you that you are right. Then, too, it can be like an unrelenting host who holds you captive until you finish every last morsel on the plate. But it tends not to stick in the memory because there's nothing in it to wonder about.</p>
        <p>Closer to the Poetic: Feb. 29, 1976</p>
        <p>No movie -- New or Old -- can be analyzed as if it were an editorial, at least, not if it's any good. If one has to make an association to the written word, a movie is closer to the poetic form, full of subliminal impulses, which is why the great ones delight both the child and the aging adult who imprisons him.</p>
        <p>On Accessibility: Oct. 13, 1977</p>
        <p>When one says a film is accessible, what is one actually saying? Not that one can get physically at it, though I guess it's possible to arm oneself with a lead pipe and break into the projection booth to carry off the print. Few of us are so obsessed.</p>
        <p>What one hopes to mean, I suppose, is that a film makes sense. One can get at its meaning, rather as if one had to break through a thick, cement-like casing to extract the kernel of truth within. But even this is not quite the way it is. A movie doesn't have a shell, or if it does, the shell is as much the movie as any treasure inside.</p>
        <p>Beware of Hat-Tossers: Nov. 18, 1979</p>
        <p>Remain skeptical when a critic says he wants to cheer, sing or write home about a particular movie. The critic may feel good about a particular movie, even exhilarated sometimes, but he seldom cheers, sings or writes home. I know from experience. Also, be wary of the critic who wants to toss his hat in the air. He probably doesn't own a hat and is showing off for lack of anything better to do.</p>
        <p>Illusory Escapes: May 23, 1982</p>
        <p>The irritating thing about most movies that describe themselves as escapist is that they don't deliver the escape. They leave you stuck to your theater seat, smelling the sauerkraut and hot dog behind you and worrying about the health of Leonid Brezhnev. I remember seeing ''Jaws II'' in a Broadway theater where the audience cheered the credits and applauded each new shark attack but spent the rest of the movie discussing private matters and arguing about whose turn it was to go to the candy stand. That's escapism in fits and starts.</p>
        <p>Now and Then: Oct. 19, 1986</p>
        <p>What's missing is not necessarily a sense of history -- today's filmmakers are probably better educated than any have been since movies were invented -- but an appreciation of the past as it differs from the present, which is, I suppose, an awareness of mortality.</p>
        <p>On Concepts: June 26, 1983</p>
        <p>Are there new ideas for movies anymore?</p>
        <p>THEATER:  ''Sunset Boulevard'': Dec. 19, 1993</p>
        <p>This isn't a Glenn Close you have ever seen in movies. There have been hints of her reserves of power in ''Dangerous Liaisons,''  ''Reversal of Fortune'' and even in ''Fatal Attraction.'' Yet nothing she has done comes near the commanding figure she creates in this new Andrew Lloyd Webber extravaganza. Ms. Close's performance [as Norma Desmond] is ravishing. Her looks astonish -- the high cheekbones, the Rooseveltian jaw, the eyes staring out from the pale face beneath a thick layer of mascara. She somehow manages to suggest Lon Chaney's silent-screen Phantom of the Opera, and even the one in Mr. Lloyd Webber's long-running Broadway chestnut, without sacrificing either her beauty or her intelligence as an actress.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of John Napier's eye-popping production design is the cavernous drawing room of Norma's old Sunset Boulevard mansion. Almost as high as the nave of Notre Dame de Paris, the drawing room suggests the main lobby of the old Roxy Theater, being all tarnished gilt with plaster pillars that are vaguely Aztec and a little bit Sumerian but mostly 1920's picture-palace Renaissance. There are also a tile floor, a pipe organ, a massive sofa and a grand stairway that curves upward toward the loges. The only thing missing is a drinking fountain and a glass tube of Dixie cups.</p>
        <p>''Barrymore'': Oct. 6, 1996</p>
        <p>In keeping with the flamboyance of the character, Christopher Plummer's entrance in ''Barrymore'' is not easily forgotten: A single spot shines down to create a circle of light at stage-center, but there is no one in it. Pause. Other lights come up to reveal a stage empty except for an umbrella stand that also holds a couple of swords, a laundry hamper and a draped object. There is another pause, followed by the sounds of a small commotion offstage, followed by a strong, imperious voice that seems familiar even if you can't place it.</p>
        <p>Enter a beatific Barrymore singing ''I've Got a Gal in Kalamazoo'' (at that time a hit recording by Glenn Miller and the Modernaires). Before putting down his black overnight bag with his liquor supply, he sweeps grandly around the stage, emphasizing the ''zoo-zoo-zoos'' at the end of each ''Kalamazoo'' and tripping a bit of the light fantastic. He's in dangerously high spirits. He has the look of someone who has been massaged for days, shaved an hour ago by the best barber in town, and drenched in an after-shave lotion that temporarily masks the whisky and brandy fumes. You wouldn't initially guess that he is in the last stages of cirrhosis of the liver and that his mind has become a sieve: he can't remember lines.</p>
        <p>Broadway vs. Off and Off Off: Nov. 7, 1999</p>
        <p>This month is an anniversary of sorts: the beginning of the seventh year I have been covering theater as a regular beat. Not the least of the discoveries for a man who had been made numb after decades of total immersion in films: that Off Broadway (including Off Off Broadway) is not just an alternative New York theater, but virtually the entire New York theater. Colleagues, of course, have been announcing this for years. Yet that realization came to me with the kind of shock you're supposed to experience only while watching a fiery, 12-car pile-up in a $70 million Mel Gibson movie.</p>
        <p>Today's committed playwrights, those who don't see the theater as just a way of getting into movies or television, who long to have their works performed on Broadway, as were Arthur Miller's and Tennessee Williams's, are caught in a sentimental time warp. Broadway is an alien landscape of overmiked theaters, naive, undermannered audiences and inflated costs. It isn't geared to welcome the kind of original new work that can flourish Off Broadway.</p>
