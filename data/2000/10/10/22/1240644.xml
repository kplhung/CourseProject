        <p>Your writer insightfully draws the conclusion that the problem of police perjury lies not only with the police officer. Blame must be shared by the judge who accepts the police officer's perjured testimony and the prosecutor who presents the police witness and argues his credibility without challenge. But there is another player in the criminal justice system who must share some of the blame. That player is the underpaid public defender or court-appointed lawyer who tells himself and his client that it's no use challenging the police and the prosecutor.</p>
        <p>I do not have sympathy for the judge and the prosecutor. But I sympathize with the court-appointed defense attorney who is so poorly compensated for his work by the state. In my state, court-appointed defense attorneys earn $35 an hour to defend serious felony charges in superior court. If you take into consideration that the court-appointed lawyer is a private practitioner who accepts the court's appointment and must pay his overhead expenses, he is probably netting about $10 per hour. How can someone who is facing 23 years in prison and the power of the government defend himself adequately when his lawyer is earning less money than anyone else in the courtroom? The loser is not only the poor defendant but society.</p>
