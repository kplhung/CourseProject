        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your recent article on elderly living options [ ''More Elderly Living Options, at a Price,'' Oct. 8] noted the precise problem facing our elderly -- the high cost of housing. The real estate and building costs in New York City and Manhattan, in particular, for developing senior housing and affordable assisted living are prohibitive.</p>
        <p>In 1998, I formed an assisted living task force of not-for-profit senior housing developers, who defined three major obstacles they face in the current real estate market to building affordable assisted living -- the high costs of land acquisition, construction and the provision of services. If we are to remain a city that is caring and inclusive of all its citizens, we must address the problem that confronts the majority of seniors, who have worked all of their lives and who are now in the middle class range of making $20,000-$30,000 in retirement and yet, as your article points out, do not have many options for housing.</p>
        <p>A first necessary action, and one I have already urged, is for the city to sell selected city-owned property for $1 to developers of affordable senior housing, including assisted living. The current city policy too often focuses on the price to be paid, and almost never on the use the property will be put to, which only ensures fewer elderly living options. Secondly, I had new legislation introduced in Albany, which would give permanent tax exemptions to not-for-profits who build affordable assisted living facilities (none currently exists). Both of these proposals demand wide support, because it is essential that our city provide our seniors affordable housing options.</p>
