        <p>THE Urusline School, a Catholic girls' school here, has begun a campaign to raise $6 million for an arts center.</p>
        <p>The campaign follows recent initiatives to provide all students with computer laptops, install wireless networking in the school, modernize the school's science labs, renovate the gymnasium and computerize the library.</p>
        <p>''We've had a strong program in art, but not as strong a program in music,'' said Sister Jean Baptiste Nicholson, principal of the 750-student school for sixth through 12th-grade girls.</p>
        <p>She said space limitations meant that students currently rehearsing the fall play have to work in the cafeteria, with plays performed in the gym. There is such a crunch, she added, that with 24 athletic teams fielded by the school, the play's performances are scheduled for the weekend before basketball season begins, when the students can have access to the gym.</p>
        <p>The Ursuline Arts Center, a 27,000-square-foot building, which will be at the back of the school's main building on its campus, is to be ready for occupancy in the 2001-2002 academic year, with groundbreaking slated for this fall. The building will house a 300-seat performing arts theater, two art classrooms and space for band, orchestra and dance classes.</p>
        <p>Since January, the school has received $1.2 million in pledges, with another commitment from an alumna for an additional $1.5 million. The school also has arranged a $4.5 million loan from the Allied Irish Bank in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>With this fund-raising drive under way through next June, the school has begun the kinds of fund-raising efforts that have usually been the domain of boys' schools.</p>
        <p>''Historically, women's schools have not done as well in fund-raising,'' Sister Jean Baptiste said. ''Women haven't had control of money until recently. Even when they have money, they are afraid to give it.''</p>
