        <p>A leader of Yasir Arafat's Fatah movement who has organized the biggest West Bank street protests vowed today to continue confrontations with Israeli forces until they withdraw from the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip, as they did from Lebanon earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Within hours of his remarks, renewed clashes with Israeli troops left at least four more Palestinian protesters dead, two in the West Bank and two in Gaza.</p>
        <p>The Fatah leader, Marwan Barghouti, who led a West Bank faction with tens of thousands of members and an unofficial armed militia, also called for further demonstrations by Palestinians and their supporters elsewhere in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barghouti appeared to some to be seizing the spotlight from Mr. Arafat, who was in Cairo as the central figure in the first full meeting of Arab heads of state in a decade. He even indirectly took credit for the Arab League conclave, accurately noting that it had been called in response to the street protests he has helped organize.</p>
        <p>''For five years we had been asking for an Arab summit, and after one week of the intifada we had an Arab summit,'' he said. ''This intifada crosses borders, and it is able to influence the entire region.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barghouti welcomed Prime Minister Ehud Barak's announcement on Friday that he is considering halting peace talks, calling it an opportunity for Israel to pull out of the West Bank and Gaza unilaterally.</p>
        <p>''It is time for the Israeli government to make a brave decision,'' Mr. Barghouti told more than a hundred foreign journalists he had gathered for a news conference here, a sign of his new stature as the acknowledged spokesman of the violent street protests of the past three weeks.</p>
        <p>''As they made the decision to withdraw from southern Lebanon, they should make the decision to withdraw from the areas here that they occupied after 1967,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barghouti said he was ''expressing the viewpoint of the Fatah movement,'' the political organization that is led by Mr. Arafat and that dominates the upper echelons of the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Barghouti is not himself one of the 20 members of Fatah's central committee, but he is among the few Fatah leaders with his own grass-roots political base, and his troops -- some of them armed -- have played a central role in the protests.</p>
        <p>''People are only listening to me these days because I am with the intifada,'' he said, using the common term for such protests. ''It is because I am with them, not because they are with me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barghouti reiterated his caustic denunciations of the American-refereed peace talks Mr. Arafat has participated in for the past seven years. He also made it clear that he was rejecting calls from more senior figures in Mr. Arafat's movement to keep protests restrained and confined to West Bank city centers.</p>
        <p>He repeatedly swore his fealty to Mr. Arafat, but confidence does not extend to Mr. Arafat's diplomatic team, however. ''The Palestinian people are fed up with Saeb Erekat's recitation of the 34 Israeli violations of the various peace agreements,'' he said in an unusual ad hominem attack on the Palestinians' senior negotiator.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians should reject the American role as ''sole monopolizer of the peace process'' and bring the United Nations, the European Union and Russia into the talks, he said.</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Barghouti evoked the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, Israel faced another challenge along the border there. One and probably two presumed guerrillas were killed by Israeli forces Friday night as they tried to sneak into Israel, said Israeli military officials and preliminary reports from the border area. Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia based in southern Lebanon, denied any role in the raid.</p>
        <p>The immediate presumption of United Nations officials in the area was that the men trying to cross into Israel were Palestinians, although there was no indication that they were acting on behalf of any group.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Barghouti spoke today, thousands of mourners gathered near Ramallah's main downtown cemetery for the funeral of one of the 10 Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli troops on Friday.</p>
        <p>After the services, in what has become an almost daily ritual, hundreds of teenage boys headed off toward the closest Israeli military post, their slingshots at the ready. Within an hour, the rock-throwing clashes with heavily armed Israeli troops began anew, and two youths were killed.</p>
        <p>One of those killed in the Gaza Strip was a 15-year-old youth who died in fighting with Israeli forces, raising the death toll for the past 22 days of violence to more than 120, all but eight of them Arabs.</p>
        <p>''The Israelis want peace, security, stability and occupation,'' Mr.  Barghouti said, but the street protests are showing Israel ''that it must choose between stability and occupation.''</p>
