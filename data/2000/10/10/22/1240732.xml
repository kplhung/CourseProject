        <p>TONY DeMATTEO had an early inkling that his first football season at Somers High might be special.</p>
        <p>''I'm a pretty difficult coach to play for,'' said DeMatteo, whose undefeated Tuskers played host to Pearl River in a playoff game last night. ''Sometimes it takes time. But these kids responded to my methods right away.''</p>
        <p>They are methods that at Roosevelt High in Yonkers, in the county's most competitive section, produced a record 208 victories, 7 sectional titles and a class AA state championship in 31 years. But they are not easy.</p>
        <p>''I try to go beyond trying to win football games,'' the veteran coach said. ''I want these young men to learn that hard work pays off as a lesson for life.''</p>
        <p>DeMatteo paused. A smile spread from the corners of his mouth. ''In preseason camp they were in shock,'' he said. ''They came to us at 7:30 in the morning, and they left at 8:15 at night. We had three separate practices each day.'' Even the pros almost never go beyond two a day.</p>
        <p>''And I didn't have a single kid quit. That's when I thought we might have something special.''</p>
        <p>Special as in a 6-0 regular season after beating their traditional rival, J. F. Kennedy 49 to 7 a week ago yesterday. Special as in 242 points scored and 35 points allowed. Special as in the No. 1 rating among Class A/B teams in the area.</p>
        <p>There had been speculation that white suburban kids might not take to DeMatteo's methods as had Roosevelt's less affluent kids. It was dispelled in a hurry.</p>
        <p>Somers, now the B-North champion, opened against a tough Nanuet squad, which now stands atop the B South standings. Somers won, 21 to 7.</p>
        <p>''Kids are kids,'' DeMatteo said. ''The first half of my time at Roosevelt, I had only white kids. The second half, it was primarily Hispanics and blacks. They can all work hard for a goal.''</p>
        <p>Brandon Von Heyn has. He is a senior fullback and a co-captain on the Somers squad. ''Before we went to camp,'' he said, ''I expected I'd have to work harder than I ever had. It came true. But it's paying off.''</p>
        <p>Paying off so well that even the coach is surprised. ''We've only got 23 kids on the varsity,'' DeMatteo said, ''and 21 of them are playing at least half the game, many on both offense and defense.</p>
        <p>''We have a really nice balance. I'm usually a defense-oriented coach, but we're so explosive, as explosive as any team I've ever had. On offense, it reminds me of my 1996 state champs.''</p>
        <p>In the opening game, Jack Garland, after missing a season with a dislocated shoulder, had two long touchdown runs. Against Byram Hills, the halfback Jordan Rabidou and Von Heyn both scored twice. In the 61-to-7 rout of Beacon, Rob Smith had four touchdowns. Rabidou had two long touchdowns against Kennedy. The quarterbacks, the senior starter Jeff Weiner and Joe Kugler, are efficient and interchangeable.</p>
        <p>''I've got eight different backs, and they are all good,'' DeMatteo said. ''Some coaches believe you have to settle on one quarterback, but I don't. If I've got two good ones, I play them both.''</p>
        <p>Smith's legs are a big part of the offensive equation. So is his toe. ''He might be the best kicker I've ever had,'' DeMatteo said. ''When we're on the other team's 30, we can go for a field goal.'' That means Smith is a threat from up to 47 yards.</p>
        <p>The defense is undersize and overachieving. ''Our offensive line averages only 190 pounds, but the defensive line averages even less,'' DeMatteo said. ''The hub of the defense is Brian Mullaney, our nose guard. He's only 160 pounds, but he's strong. If they don't double him, he makes the play,'' the coach added. ''If they do, someone else is free to make the play.''</p>
        <p>DeMatteo went to the smaller Somers program to finish his career coaching in the community where he lives and to coach his two youngest sons. Albert is a sixth grader in the Pop Warner program, but he went especially to help Anthony, a sophomore, fulfill a football dream. Born without a left forearm and hand, Anthony is a substitute split end-defensive end and a special-teams volunteer. Last Monday, he helped fill out the junior varsity and caught a touchdown pass.</p>
        <p>''He's been able to function so well you don't think about it,'' his father said.</p>
        <p>Still, coaching one's son can be tricky.</p>
        <p>''When you coach your son, the highs are higher and the lows are lower,'' DeMatteo said. ''I had my oldest boy, Dominick, who is now the backfield coach at Fordham, at Roosevelt. When things are going bad, or horrible, you're thinking, 'I wish my son wasn't going through this.'</p>
        <p>''And I have to let the team know there's no favoritism so, in retrospect, I might have gone out of my way to get on Anthony.''</p>
        <p>The son agreed.</p>
        <p>''I've been looking forward to this since I was a little kid at the games,'' Anthony DeMatteo said of playing for his father.  ''But at the beginning it was rough.</p>
        <p>''I'd do something not so wrong, and he'd go crazy on me. Another kid would do the same thing and he wouldn't, but you get used to it. And it's turned out even better than I expected.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps that's because of DeMatteo's approach to the young men he coaches. Von Heyn said, ''He treats us all like sons.''</p>
