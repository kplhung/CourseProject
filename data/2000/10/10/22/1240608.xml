        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>LOVING GRAHAM GREENE, by Gloria Emerson. (Random House, $22.95.) A beguiling first novel in which a rich, eccentric American woman with an idolatrous crush on Greene sets out to do good in this world by saving Algerian journalists from hit squads, an effort that fails so flatly and awfully she loses all hope in life.</p>
        <p>AN AMERICAN STORY, by Debra J. Dickerson. (Pantheon, $24.) A frank and unsparing memoir by a smart, high-achieving African-American woman and Harvard-trained lawyer one generation from Mississippi who found that other blacks often discouraged and retarded her upward mobility while the Air Force, which she joined at 20, enhanced it.</p>
        <p>EINSTEIN IN LOVE: A Scientific Romance, by Dennis Overbye. (Viking, $27.95.) An antiromance, really, in which Overbye, the deputy science editor of The Times, applies recent discoveries about Einstein to examine both his scientific work and his emotional life; in the end, he portrays the great scientist as a rat with women and an irresponsible father.</p>
        <p>HO CHI MINH, by William J. Duiker. (Hyperion, $35.) A retired professor of history and Foreign Service officer who has spent 20 years collecting the facts fills in lots of empty space in the life of a man who was almost as unknown as North Vietnam's leader in the 60's as when he was a pastry cook in London during World War I.</p>
        <p>BELLOW: A Biography, by James Atlas. (Random House, $35.) A huge, scrupulous, faithfully exhaustive account of the endless life (85 and still going strong both as novelist and father) of Saul Bellow.</p>
        <p>THE BLOOD RUNS LIKE A RIVER THROUGH MY DREAMS: A Memoir, by Nasdijj. (Houghton Mifflin, $23.) A hard, bitter but nevertheless engaging account of a life itself hard and bitter, by a writer who counts himself an Indian and has suffered racism, exclusion, fetal alcohol syndrome and quite a lot of rotten luck.</p>
        <p>A WHALE HUNT, by Robert Sullivan. (Scribner, $25.) The funny, generous product of a two years' vigil with the Makah Indians of Neah Bay, Wash., and their effort to re-establish the cultural tradition of whale hunting, abandoned so long ago they had to learn it from scratch while animal rights people hung around and condemned the whole affair.</p>
        <p>JOE COLLEGE, by Tom Perrotta. (St. Martin's, $23.95.) Perrotta's fourth book of fiction somewhat cheerfully explores the social shuffling of the meritocracy by casting a working-class student from New Jersey into Yale, where aspirations to assimilation try to prevail over a lot of baggage brought along from his father's lunch truck.</p>
        <p>AFTER THE WAR, by Alice Adams. (Knopf, $25.) Adams's final, alas, gossipy novel, finished before her death last year, pursues the Baird family in the Southern college town to which they have fled from the Depression; the style is as blithe and contagious as ever, and important truths transpire indirectly, if at all.</p>
