      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>PARIS is getting so much better!'' Bernadette Hirsch said last Saturday. Actually, she was hollering. It was the only way to be heard above the din at the hot new Paris restaurant where Ms. Hirsch was, at the moment in question, standing on a dining table writhing to an Arabic cover of the theme from ''Shaft.''</p>
        <p>''The economy is improving,'' explained Ms. Hirsch, herself the proprietor of a boutique, Bernie X, which has become a necessary pit stop on the hipster circuit in Paris. ''People want to have fun again.''</p>

        <p>PARIS is getting so much better!'' Bernadette Hirsch said last Saturday. Actually, she was hollering. It was the only way to be heard above the din at the hot new Paris restaurant where Ms. Hirsch was, at the moment in question, standing on a dining table writhing to an Arabic cover of the theme from ''Shaft.''</p>
        <p>''The economy is improving,'' explained Ms. Hirsch, herself the proprietor of a boutique, Bernie X, which has become a necessary pit stop on the hipster circuit in Paris. ''People want to have fun again.''</p>
        <p>Proof of this proposition might be the restaurant itself, a frenetic Brazilian dive in the 11th Arrondissement with the name Favela Chic. Favelas are the hillside slums of Brazil, which in no way resemble even the grungiest sections of Paris. And ''chic'' is the last word that would ever be applied to those appalling shantytowns. But the oxymoron is intentional, affectionate and meant to convey something like a Frenchified version of that most American of concepts, Ghetto Fabulous.</p>
        <p>''People in favelas don't have any choice about living there,'' explained Rosane Mazzer, one of Favela Chic's three owners. ''But they still have a lot of energy, of life. It's their own chic.''</p>
        <p>If so, it's a chic that Parisians -- typically no slouches in this department -- are consuming whole hog. Every night but Sunday they throng the small restaurant on the Rue du Faubourg du Temple, happily wait hours in order to jam themselves into communal tables, swill lethal caipirinhas, attack huge plates of cheap and typical Brazilian food like the mixed grill feijoada and then commence to do what they really came for -- jump on the tables and dance.</p>
        <p>''It's wild,'' said Richard Buckley, editor in chief of Vogue Hommes, one of the club's early proponents, who compared its excitement to that of 70's Paris, ''when people were still having fun.''</p>
        <p>Now as ever, ''fun'' is not a noun that trips easily off the Parisian tongue. In fact there is no word in the French language that conveys with such jaunty concision a state opposite to the customary self-consciousness of even the hippest Paris scenes. ''Well, it's not the supertrendiest club,'' Ezra Petronio, the editor of the Paris-based fashion magazine Self Service, pronounced recently of Favela Chic.</p>
        <p>And it is not. The supertrendiest Paris clubs of the moment are not really clubs at all, but one-night-only parties staged in changeable locations by celebrity D.J.'s for their 200 closest friends. Such evenings might feature Daft Punk or AIR or else Dimitri from Paris, playing the locally popular mixture of computer-enhanced Chicago house music, goofy lounge songs of the 60's and vintage Serge Gainsbourg or Francoise Hardy, those chestnuts of French cool.</p>
        <p>The supertrendiest clubs of the moment-before-last were Latino-style dives that mushroomed along the working-class streets near the Place de la Republique. So many of them featured Che Guevara murals and ersatz salsa that some people began to deride a particular stretch of Rue Oberkampf as a Latino Disneyland.</p>
        <p>Favela Chic first opened on that block five years ago, as a tiny Brazilian-style restaurant cum club of a sort Parisians call a ''restobar.'' The place was a hit from the beginning. ''We started doing a big business immediately,'' Ms. Mazzer said. ''It was much more than we expected, I don't know why.''</p>
        <p>There is no mystery. Tropical spirit, propulsive music and close quarters resulted in a restaurant where people barely bothered to dine -- in Paris, a novel idea. The real reason no one ate, however, is that the tables were always occupied with people flailing around. ''It's like there are electrical buzzers in the chairs,'' Herve Martin, a French fashion publicist, said last week at the club. ''A certain moment arrives, and people spontaneously jump up.''</p>
        <p>At the end of last year, Ms. Mazzer and her partners went looking for a new location because, she said, ''the area where we were was becoming too mainstream.'' They found a business partner who advised them to change nothing about Favela Chic but to add more tables. The table dancing, Ms. Mazzer said, ''started at our other place because it was so small and the music was so strong and there was no place to dance.'' The move was also occasioned by complaints of irate neighbors and the inconvenient lack of a cabaret license.</p>
        <p>The new restaurant opened in May, in a semi-industrial space that had been used, at different times, as a stable and a Cacharel showroom. Now, a score of communal plank tables are set perpendicular to a wall in the large shoebox-shaped space, a Baroque style bed is tucked in a corner, ratty chairs and stools of every description are scattered around, a huge shrine consecrated to Brazil's Candomble religion, replete with statuary, food offerings, lighted  candles and pine boughs, is set at the entryway.</p>
        <p>Alongside the bar at the rear of the restaurant, is a plank and chicken wire D.J. booth that looks like the announcer's stand at a cockfight. ''Nous ne sommes pas un Disneyland Latino,'' reads a sign tacked to the door. (''We are not a Latino Disneyland.'') The distinction is important in a city where, as Dan Levine, the editor of the new Avant Guide to Paris, said, ''lounge is new, mixed drinks are new, all these things we think of as old school in the United States are new,'' and where, he added, ''real Latin culture is only now coming to a country that considers itself Latin.'' At Favela Chic, Ms. Mazzer said last Saturday night, ''Parisians get to feel free.''</p>
        <p>As she spoke, the club's bouncer, a giant with a huge Afro and a fake mink jacket, who calls himself Thierry the Big, was somehow simultaneously showing a party of Brazilian models to a table and an obstreperous drunk to the door. The chef, Carlos Hijueras, was mounding rice onto dishes with his bare hands and dancing the plates to the service bar. A French documentary filmmaker, Bernard Crouzet, was doing the skate on top of his chair. An English professor from the University of Salzburg was announcing to anyone in earshot that she had reached that point of inebriation where she was ''ready to make out with strangers.''</p>
        <p>And the D.J., Gringo da Parada (ne Jerome Pigeon), was concocting an aural collage that mixed disco hits like ''Mr. Big Stuff'' with ''Dueling Banjos'' and ''Louie, Louie'' in a Spanish version, and Elvis Presley's ''Love Me Tender'' and fragments of Dr. Martin Luther King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech, all laid over a propulsive samba beat.</p>
        <p>''Camarades, camarades, camarades,'' said Gringo da Parada, from his booth, before dropping the needle on a record of ''Yes, We Have No Bananas.'' At this, a Brazilian catwalk star, Talytha Pugliese, leapt up and started to sway. ''I miss Brazil so much,'' she shouted over the din.</p>
        <p>With one arm balancing an enormous tray of capetas -- a cocktail made from cachaca and lime over crushed ice, spiked with guarana powder from the Amazon -- Ms. Mazzer surveyed the scene. ''It's a crazy stew,'' she said. ''And it only works if you add a little Brazilian fish.''</p>
