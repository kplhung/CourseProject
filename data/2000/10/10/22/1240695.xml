        <p>While the United States focuses its attention on the next presidential election, the Baltimore Museum of Art is presenting a collection of furnishings and fashion, art and china associated with 15 residents, ranging from George Washington to Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>Among the highlights of the exhibition, called ''Power, Politics and Style: Art for the Presidents,'' are a study for a posthumous portrait of a pensive John F. Kennedy by Aaron Shikler; a uniform for White House guards, commissioned by Richard M. Nixon and found by critics to be better suited for an operetta; and a Roman-style silver wine jug designed by Thomas Jefferson.</p>

        <p>While the United States focuses its attention on the next presidential election, the Baltimore Museum of Art is presenting a collection of furnishings and fashion, art and china associated with 15 residents, ranging from George Washington to Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>Among the highlights of the exhibition, called ''Power, Politics and Style: Art for the Presidents,'' are a study for a posthumous portrait of a pensive John F. Kennedy by Aaron Shikler; a uniform for White House guards, commissioned by Richard M. Nixon and found by critics to be better suited for an operetta; and a Roman-style silver wine jug designed by Thomas Jefferson.</p>
        <p>The Clinton period is represented by a photograph of Hillary Rodham Clinton by Annie Leibovitz and a swatch of fabric from a reupholstered Blue Room chair.</p>
        <p>Artists whose work is on view include the cabinetmakers William King and Pierre-Antoine Bellange, the architects Pierre-Charles L'Enfant and Charles McKim, and the dress designer Oleg Cassini.</p>
        <p>Reproduced for the exhibition are  six pieces -- including two chairs and two sofas -- that were part of a 36-piece set commissioned by James Madison and destroyed in the White House fire during the War of 1812.</p>
        <p>The Baltimore Museum of Art is on Art Museum Drive at North Charles and 31st Streets; (410) 396-7100; www.artbma.org. General admission: $6 (free Thursday); closed Monday and Tuesday. The exhibition runs until Jan. 7, 13 days before Inauguration Day.</p>
