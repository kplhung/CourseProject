        <p>An elderly Ukrainian has claimed in an interview broadcast here that he was the World War II fighter who arrested Raoul Wallenberg, the legendary Swedish diplomat who helped thousands of Jews escape Nazi capture before vanishing forever into Soviet hands in 1945.</p>
        <p>The claim by Bogdan Tarnavsky, who said he was an anti-Nazi guerrilla in the waning days of World War II, adds to what has been a 55-year mystery surrounding Mr. Wallenberg's disappearance and fate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tarnavsky's story is at some odds with the accepted account of Mr. Wallenberg's disappearance: that he drove off with Soviet guards in January 1945, saying he wanted to discuss protection for Jews once the Red Army liberated Hungary, and never returned.</p>
        <p>The central questions in Mr. Wallenberg's story also remain unanswered: why the Kremlin sought to arrest him in the first place, and whether he died of a heart attack, as the Soviets later stated, in a Moscow jail in 1947.</p>
        <p>In an interview broadcast late Friday on Russia's N.T.V. network, Mr. Tarnavsky, clad in a sweat shirt and trembling from the infirmities of age, said he was patrolling the Hungarian countryside about 40 miles from Budapest in January 1945 when he stopped a man carrying what he thought was a suspicious-looking mess tin.</p>
        <p>''I ordered, 'Drop this tin now, and hands up.' '' Mr. Tarnavsky said. ''He understood and raised his hands. In his pockets, I found only a mirror and comb. Nothing else, not even matches.''</p>
        <p>But when he saw that the shoulders of the man's jacket appeared too thick, he said, ''I felt it with my hand and found some documents sewn up under the lining. I cut it with my knife -- it was a good knife! -- and see a Swedish passport and a Belgian passport, but both have the same name.''</p>
        <p>After the two returned to his unit of Ukrainian partisans -- with Mr. Wallenberg carrying one boot in his teeth to deter an escape -- intelligence officers apparently made contact with their allies in the Soviet Army. That same evening, Mr. Tarnavsky said, an airplane whisked Mr. Wallenberg to the Polish-Ukrainian city of Lviv, and then to Moscow.</p>
