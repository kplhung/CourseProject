        <p>IN the cliffhanger that is the 2000 race for president, the drama should be palpable. Suspense should be building because, with just 16 days left, either Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush could take the White House.</p>
        <p>Why, then, in the tightest presidential contest in decades, do people seem more at the edge of boredom than at the edge of their seats?</p>
        <p>The audience for the three presidential debates fell sharply from most other campaigns, and was no better than four years ago -- when the race was something of a dud. Ratings were down on the national conventions. And voting experts project that despite the closeness of the race, turnout at the polls will not likely surpass 1996, and may dip further.</p>
        <p>It may be the candidates' own fault. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have so narrow-casted their message to a sliver of voters in swing states crucial for an electoral college victory that they have deserted the rest.  Meanwhile, those in the sights of the candidates -- in fierce battlegrounds like here in Michigan -- seem to yearn for candidates who can stir more passion.</p>
        <p>Rather than talk about the merits of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, two patrons at Dawn Donuts in Saginaw (''101 Delicious Varieties''), a Democrat and a Republican, lamented last week about how they missed a politician like Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>''I didn't like him,'' said John Anguiano, 65, the Democrat, who explained that he never voted for Mr. Reagan ''But he was a good politician because he was a good actor. He knew how to smile.''</p>
        <p>Personality aside, the problem for many people may not be a paucity of issues, but the issues that the candidates chose to discuss. More and more, the nominees are focusing on those few million undecided voters who, if they choose to vote at all, may decide the election. So even if the race is climactic, that may not be enough to make voting relevant to a wider audience. It may be similar to how some people view movie stars: they like to gossip about them but do not bother to see their movies.</p>
        <p>''People have increasingly come to see the election as a kind of drama but one that doesn't have some direct affect on their lives,'' said Neal Gabler, author of ''Life, the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality.'' (Knopf, 1998.) ''There's a very interesting distinction: You can be a political junkie but not vote. That's a new phenomenon.''</p>
        <p>The wider public may also feel neglected because, as Curtis B. Gans, director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate, put it: ''There's a broad mass of the American people who are not involved in most of the issues at stake. The candidates are not talking to a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>The prescription drug and Medicare proposals that are so in the forefront of the campaign, for example, are designed to appeal to the crucial block of elderly voters. No wonder young people tell pollsters they feel even more alienated from the process this year. Other segments of the population feel downright left out: When was the last time one of the candidates made a speech on issues near and dear to big city dwellers?</p>
        <p>What the candidates are talking about seems only to accentuate their similarities. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have strikingly different philosophies and stands on everything ranging from abortion to the role of government to the Supreme Court to gun laws. Yet, in the candidates' determination to be all things to all voters, it is hardly surprising that voters cannot tell the two apart (even when they are not standing side-by-side wearing red ties).</p>
        <p>Gun control seemed a natural this year for the Democrats. But the vice president has largely stayed clear of the issue because polls suggest it will not win him any votes among undecided voters in swing states. Same with capital punishment. Both candidates favor it, but Mr. Gore has not even probed Mr. Bush's potential vulnerability by addressing racial disparities and other issues the death penalty underscores.</p>
        <p>The truth is, the passion has been diminishing for some time, but is more obvious this year given that the closeness of the race would seem to stir some excitement. Part of reason for the lack of engagement is that there are so many other distractions. If Sundaysoccer practice is taking priority over church for some families, how can politics be sacred?</p>
        <p>Yet factors unique to the current campaign -- namely the nominees themselves -- are also driving the lack of engagement.</p>
        <p>An obvious explanation is that in blissful economic times, voters never have much taste for politics. That is especially true when no war-and-peace issues are brewing. In 1960, voters seemed riveted by the presidential campaign not because the economy was in the tank (it wasn't) but because there were weighty matters at stake. Somehow, the tussle over whether Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush would offer more generous prescription drug benefits does not seem on par with the space race or the missile gap.</p>
        <p>''I held out hope that the debates might energize the public and that the closeness of the race would come together,'' said Tom Patterson, a government professor at Harvard University and co-director of Harvard University ''Vanishing Voter'' project. Instead, he said, ''We're seeing an accelerated movement away from politics.''</p>
        <p>It may be unfair to ridicule uninterested voters this year because it takes more than a down-to-the-wire competition to drive people to the polls. From President Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide of 1964 to Richard M. Nixon's squeaker of 1968, turnout actually declined. And turnout for the close race between President Jimmy Carter and Mr. Reagan in 1980 was no higher than in 1972, when Mr. Nixon faced a faltering challenger in George S. McGovern. Perhaps people are not moving away from politics as much as they are redefining political participation. Perhaps watching a candidate on the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' has somehow become a substitute for voting.</p>
        <p>Another reason people hesitate to vote is that while the denouement of this campaign may be exciting, the two guys playing the leads are not living up to the script. ''There's nobody turned on by this election,'' said Gov. Jesse Venture of Minnesota, the independent and former professional wrestler. ''Maybe people want to be entertained. Maybe the question is: Have we become a society based upon entertainment?''</p>
        <p>If so, the candidates are not succeeding in enhancing their appeal with a strong narrative. ''No one's telling a story,'' said James Carville, the Clinton strategist. ''There's no drama here.''</p>
        <p>Even the impressive early rallying around Mr. Bush before the primaries seemed motivated not so much by Bush the man (many of his early supporters had never met him) but by Bush the man who has the best shot at returning his party to the White House.</p>
        <p>Neither candidate seems to leave voters exhilarated. For all of their faults, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot caught voters' attention in 1992. Their appeal may not have been on personality alone: Mr. Clinton fashioned a new Democratic candidacy by appropriating Republican ideas as his own. And Mr. Perot, while scoring points for his plain-speaking, injected himself into the campaign because he had lots of money. Senator John McCain spurred record turnout because he somehow awakened new voters with the allure of his own story.</p>
        <p>In interview after interview in battleground states, even people who said they are interested enough to vote admitted they were not enthralled with Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore. Francis Fritz, 61, a retired Firestone store manager in Saginaw, said he was torn between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush. Did the debates help him decide? ''I think they were boring,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet maybe it is too much to ask for politicians to be entertaining. Jim Lehrer, the PBS anchor who moderated the debates, said such events are for sober-minded voters, and if others tune out, so be it. Asked how much the ratings dwindled this year, he said, ''I have no idea. I don't say, 'How can I make this as exciting as the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus?' You've got two men, one of whom is going to be the next president of the United States.''</p>
