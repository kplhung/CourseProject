        <p>Kevin Mawae bowed his head at a conference for Christian athletes in San Diego two years ago and prayed. Mawae asked for guidance, for God to put him, the best young center in football, wherever he wanted him.</p>
        <p>Mawae had once sworn he would never live in New York and certainly would never play for Bill Parcells, but that was before the car accident that killed his brother, before he discovered his faith, before he thought that, perhaps, he could do something more significant for the Jets than merely shoving opposing defenders out of the way.</p>
        <p>But this is, after all, football and Mawae, while holding his faith deeply, was certainly not going to be unaware of where it could lead him. He had checked out his other options: New Orleans, the closest National Football League city to his hometown of Leesville, La., was not even sure who the Saints quarterback would be; and Philadelphia was a dump; and Seattle, where he played his first four years in the N.F.L., wasn't offering enough money. And in San Diego, Mawae was put off because the Chargers seemed willing to let the players call the shots.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Jets were offering more money than a center had ever made in the league -- a five-year, $16.8 million contract that included a $5 million signing bonus -- but the Jets also had two things Mawae was sure he did not want since the day he left Louisiana State to become a pro football player: New York and Parcells.</p>
        <p>''You see Parcells on television and he's a jerk, crazy and demented,'' Mawae said. ''I had had a coach like that and I didn't want to play for a coach like that again.''</p>
        <p>Mawae overcame his reservations and now grounds an offensive line for a Jets offense that relies more than ever on the running of Curtis Martin. Martin says that Mawae is ''the anchor of the offensive line. They go as he goes.''</p>
        <p>The formula seems to be working. The offensive line has allowed just seven sacks this season, and it was particularly impressive against New England last week.</p>
        <p>Against a Patriots defense that had held their last two opponents to under 100 yards rushing, Martin rushed for 143 yards and 3 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night, Mawae, who was listed as doubtful for this week's game against Miami with a sore foot, will likely face linebacker Zach Thomas, who himself was on the injured list. Both Mawae and Thomas are expected to play. Their battle is a feature matchup for the football purist: Mawae, who despite his 6 feet 4 inches and 305 pounds is unusually mobile for his position, has generally prevailed against the equally agile, 5-11, 235-pound Thomas. If the Jets are to beat the Dolphins to move to the top of the division, Mawae will again have to make sure that Thomas does not blow up the Jets offense.</p>
        <p>''It will be a cat-and-mouse, catch-me-if-you-can type of game,'' Jets Coach Al Groh said. ''The athletic center makes a big difference in the middle of the line, whether you bring him out in pass protection or pull him in for running. Kevin's got excellent lateral quickness. I'm sure Zach doesn't see a center every week who can get out and chase him. It looks as if both of them realize that one step slow and the other guy is going to catch him.''</p>
        <p>Which is why Parcells wanted Mawae when he became a free agent in 1998. Mawae and his wife, Traci, sat in Parcells's office in Hempstead, N.Y., and Parcells, the master salesman, pulled out a binder. In it was a piece of paper, on which Parcells had written that his top off-season priority for 1998 was to find a center. That little nugget was nestled in Mawae's head when he and Traci arrived at the Christian conference in San Diego.</p>
        <p>Mawae's brother John had been killed in a car accident in May 1996, shorty after John had been baptized. ''The last words I heard my brother say,'' Mawae says, ''was 'I need to tell you about something.' I know that it was.''</p>
        <p>John, who liked a good party, had calmed down just before his death, and Mawae says that his brother wanted to tell him about how he had found his faith. Two months later, Mawae's wife became pregnant and Mawae was struck by how God could take so much from him and then give him so much so soon after. He and Traci began to read the Bible.</p>
        <p>Mawae became a born-again Christian in June 1997, just before the start of his final season in Seattle. There would be no more drinking with his teammates and he would try to stop cursing. At the conference in San Diego, Mawae spoke with Rick Lyle, a Jets defensive end whom he has known since the Blue-Gray college all-star game. And so Mawae prayed about the decision he faced.</p>
        <p>When you ask Mawae why he chose the Jets, he will give you two distinctly different, but honest, answers. The No. 1 reason, he will say at one point, was because he felt the Jets had an opportunity to win and after four years on a moribund L.S.U. team and four years with Seattle, he wanted to enjoy the game again.</p>
        <p>But there is something else, too.</p>
        <p>Mawae is a born gabber. In the button-lipped culture of the Jets, he saw his openness as a chance to shape others. So when he asked for some help, Mawae figures, God led him to the right spot.</p>
        <p>''I believe God puts people in places for a number of reasons,'' Mawae said. ''My No. 1 reason is we had three Christians on the team when I got here and it's gone from 3 to 15 guys in our Bible study.</p>
        <p>The reason was it gives me a bigger platform to profess my faith in Christ. I take football as an opportunity to reach out to others, to show I can be a tough football player and a Christian. I feel I have a bigger influence spiritually than physically.''</p>
        <p>His influence as a communications conduit in the locker room is also incalculable. Plenty of the Jets, trained by Parcells to distrust reporters, avoid the locker room area when reporters are there. Mawae is almost always around. He was an Army brat, forced to make friends quickly. ''I like being noticed.''</p>
        <p>He also knows that for the usually anonymous offensive linemen to get some attention, some self-promotion is required. He will not reveal any team secrets, but Mawae is not shy with his opinions.</p>
        <p>He was the only Jet to publicly criticize Keyshawn Johnson's bashing of Wayne Chrebet in the week before the Tampa Bay game, when coaches had warned players to steer clear of the controversy. He bristled when told that Groh had questioned the offensive line's toughness.</p>
        <p>On the field, Mawae makes all the calls for the line, a role he relishes.</p>
        <p>''During training camp, we always do a drill and we say if you aren't the lead dog, the scenery never changes,'' Mawae said. ''All you see is the behind of someone else. If you're at the head of the pack, you always see what's coming. Leadership comes naturally to me. I enjoy being the guy people come to. If guys didn't respect me, they wouldn't do that.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets terminated the contract of wide receiver VINCENT BRISBY, a training camp signee who the Jets had hoped would become their No. 2 receiver. He has been inactive in recent weeks. That move made room for fullback/tight end JAKE MORELAND, who was signed from the practice squad.</p>
