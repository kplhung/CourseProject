        <p>Los Cabos was a wild, free place a generation ago. South of the Tropic of Cancer, where the Pacific meets the Gulf of California, were two untamed coasts graced by a few good hotels, a noble native fishing fleet and a growing clan of grizzled refugees from western civilization who had run out of road at the end of the planet's fourth longest peninsula.</p>
        <p>So long, simple life. A blitzkrieg of Californiazation is changing Los Cabos into a tourist citadel.</p>
        <p>Arguments against this -- if the gods had wanted golf in the desert, they would have made more rain -- have been bulldozed by developers trying to improve on nature. More than a half-million people a year, five times the local population, come here now. Continental Airlines plans to begin nonstop flights on Saturdays from Newark on Dec. 16.</p>
        <p>Anyone revisiting Los Cabos after a decade away will be stunned by the changes. Imagine Cape Cod morphing from the 19th century to the 21st in nine nanoseconds. But the place still has immense power, and first-timers who plan a trip with care -- and plenty of cash -- will find that the scenery still standing is superb, the fishing astonishing, the wildlife still wild, and the handful of good old hotels even better. Until someone figures out how to subdivide the gulf, also called the Sea of Cortez, Los Cabos will still be a great place.</p>
        <p>On the map, Los Cabos is a dot, a line and a dot. First comes the pleasant but rapidly expanding town of San Jose del Cabo, with a traditional central plaza and a cool green park, south of the still-under-reconstruction international airport. Next is the 18-mile corridor along the southernmost coast of the gulf, where hoteliers and time-share touts are transforming large swaths of one of the world's great landscapes. Last is the town of Cabo San Lucas, whose utterly untraditional center would be heaven on earth for a college senior on spring break.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The whales are the biggest coming attraction. Every year, from December through April, more than half the world's 25,000 gray whales swim down from the Arctic to the Pacific lagoons north of Los Cabos, and some schools round the bend into the warmer, calmer gulf. Humpback, blue, beluga and four other species of whales also visit the capes.</p>
        <p>One reputable outfit for whale watching is Baja Adventure, (52-114) 31706, which also offers kayaking, birding and mountain-biking trips, as well as swimming outings among sea lions. Book as soon as possible if you want to see the whales this winter. The company has two-night hotel and boat packages at $480 a couple, at 9 pesos to the dollar.</p>
        <p>Nov. 2 is the Day of the Dead,  celebrated throughout Mexico, with its icons of grinning skeletons. Nov. 20 is Revolution Day, Dec. 12 the Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and on Dec. 13, the beginning of traditional Christmas festivities in San Jose del Cabo. Each of these days is celebrated in ways sacred and profane: with music, food, dancing and copious amounts of tequila.</p>
        <p>The second annual Los Cabos Billfish Tournament is scheduled from Nov. 29 through Dec. 2, offering sport fishers who pay a $2,500-per-team entry fee (four anglers per team) some $350,000 in cash and prizes. The prizes are in three categories: marlin; tuna, dolphin and wahoo; and catch-and-release. The marlin -- blue, black and striped -- are said to run to half a ton.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Culture is not Los Cabos's strong suit. Nature is. Despite the pace of development, the natural world in and around Los Cabos still holds wonders. Though the area usually has about 350 sunny days a year, it receives enough rain between July and November that parts of it qualify for the botanic classification of arid tropical forest. The 125-acre estuary  in San Jose del Cabo, the only true bird sanctuary on the Baja peninsula, holds white-winged doves, vermillion flycatchers, macaws, hummingbirds and more than 100 other species. From Highway 1, the only main route, head for the southern edge  of San Jose del Cabo and take the Paseo San Jose along the gulf until it ends at a foot path to the estuary.</p>
        <p>Seeing the sights on horseback allows visitors to absorb a unique landscape. After a rain, the desert blooms with wildflowers; in a dry season, there's always the coastline. Horses can be rented at the Cuadra San Francisco Equestrian Center (no telephone calls accepted; bookings through hotels), on the highway south of San Jose.</p>
        <p>Kayaking should be done with a professional guide; the wind and the currents are intense and potentially deadly. But there is no finer way to see the best sights, most of which lie where the land meets the water. The activity center at the Cabo Pulmo Beach Resort offers five- to six-hour sea kayaking and snorkeling sessions in a national marine preserve frequented by sea lions. Outings cost $45 per person for kayaking and $35 per person for snorkeling. For reservations, (888) 997-8566.</p>
        <p>For the less intrepid, lying on a beach and watching the waves and the pelicans remains the strongest attraction of Los Cabos. The most famous is the Playa del Amor, where the ocean and the gulf meet. It is accessible only by watercraft; a water taxi can be hired at the Cabo San Lucas marina or at the better hotels. All beaches are public, but few are suitable for swimming because of the strong currents at the confluence of the gulf and the ocean. The calmest beach, and one of the best for snorkeling, is the Bahia Santa Maria.</p>
        <p>Sport fishermen can check www.mexonline.com (click on activities and then fishing and boating) for a half-dozen or more charter fishing outfits. Marlin, yellowtail tuna and swordfish are biting at the moment.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>All prices are peak winter rates for a double room, without taxes and service charges. Most prices plunge from June until October.</p>
        <p>Hotel Twin Dolphin, Highway 1, Kilometer 12, Cabo San Lucas, (800) 421-8925, fax (213) 380-1302, www .twindolphin.com, is heavenly. Built in 1977 along one of the prettiest stretches of the gulf, it blends into the landscape in a mystical way, with cactus, palms and rocks (some with rather large iguanas sunning on them) arrayed in a Mexican version of a Zen garden. The rooms are large, exceedingly comfortable and let you fall asleep to the sound of the surf below. The beach below the Twin Dolphin is beautiful but wild; swim in the nearby Bahia Santa Maria. A double room with an ocean view is $285.</p>
        <p>Casa Natalia, Boulevard Mijares 4, San Jose del Cabo, (888) 277-3814, fax (52-114) 25110, www.casanatalia .com, is a little gem run by Nathalie and Loic Tenoux, from Luxembourg and France, respectively. Fourteen rooms and two suites sit on a quiet street in downtown San Jose del Cabo. They surround a courtyard with towering palms, lighted by Rima the Bird Girl pyres at night. The rooms, each one unique, are beautifully designed, with artworks, ceramics and subtle touches. It's a 15-minute walk to the beach, but it's an urbane place to decompress. A double room is $220.</p>
        <p>Budget: The Cabo Inn, at 20 de Noviembre and Leona Vicario, Cabo San Lucas, (52-114) 30819, fax (52-114) 30819, or at www.mexonline .com/caboinn.htm, is clean as a clam and funky to a fault. True, it used to be a bordello, and so most of the rooms are quite small, but a double is $53 a night (or $300 a week).</p>
        <p>Siesta Suites, Zapata and Hidalgo, Cabo San Lucas, (52-114) 32773, fax (52-114) 36494, is six years old, with 20 clean rooms, 15 with kitchenettes, at similar rock-bottom rates: $50 a night, $320 a week.</p>
        <p>Luxury: Las Ventanas al Paraiso, Highway 1, Kilometer 19.5, (52-114) 40300, fax (52-114) 40301; www .lasventanas.com. Two words: too fabulous. Las Ventanas is a beautiful-looking concoction built in 1997. The rooms look sublime (and at $675 to $2,200 for an ocean view, they should) and the staff is superlative. But an overcooked hamburger that took 45 minutes to appear and cost $15 was too much to take. When you look up from the lovely terrace, you see condos under construction. And one visitor felt as if he had left Mexico entirely and walked into a Conde Nast fashion shoot. Still, if you desire an ounce of beluga by the shimmering pool, or a massage for your pet poodle, this is a place where money can buy just about anything.</p>
        <p>Palmilla, Highway 1, Kilometer 7.5, San Jose del Cabo, (800) 637-2226, fax (52-114) 45100, www.palmilla .com, is a pleasantly old-fashioned resort begun in 1956 as the pleasure palace of the son of a former president of Mexico. It has since expanded, containing 24 rooms starting at $395 a night and 91 suites starting at $595. The Neptune Bar, looking out over the gulf, is a delightful hangout. But here, too, condos under construction are encircling the compound.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>The Hotel Twin Dolphin's restaurant has impeccably fresh fish and superb salads, with prices that are reasonable by the somewhat staggering standards of Los Cabos (a three-course dinner for two costs about $100 with wine).</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenoux of Casa Natalia runs a good, inventive kitchen, Mi Cocina, with variations on Mexican classics and spectacular desserts ($80 or more for two with wine).</p>
        <p>Los Cabos is one of the few places in Mexico where it is hard to find good food at a fair price, but some  affordable alternatives exist.</p>
        <p>There are two branches of the Trailer Park restaurants -- one at El Faro Viejo, Matamoros and Mijares, Cabo San Lucas, (52-114) 31927, the other at La Golondrina, Paseo del Pescador, Cabo San Lucas, (52-114) 30542 -- serving identical menus. The platters of seafood and shellfish, steak and ribs are huge, with full dinners in the $25 range.</p>
        <p>Mi Casa, Calle Cabo San Lucas and Madero, across from the main plaza, (52-114) 31933, serves the Mexican classics -- chiles stuffed with seafood, the kitchen-sink stew called manchamanteles (tablecloth stainers) and chicken mole -- in a pleasant setting. Dinner for two costs $40 or so.</p>
        <p>Family-run since 1958, Felix's Taqueria, Hidalgo and Zapata, Cabo San Lucas, serves an infinite variety of fish and seafood tacos on homemade tortillas, with an encyclopedia of salsas and a full bar. It would be impossible to spend more than $15 on dinner. No telephone or credit cards.</p>
        <p>Night Life</p>
        <p>The heart of Cabo San Lucas looks like a frat boy's vision of bliss, with fun houses like the Giggling Marlin, Squid Roe and Cabo Wabo, home to the aging rock star Sammy Hagar and his house band, the Waboritas. If Saturday night in downtown Cabo sounds like a season in hell, there are many less raucous choices.</p>
        <p>Whale Watcher's Bar, Hotel Finisterra, at Land's End, south of Cabo San Lucas, (52-114) 33333, is open daily until 11 p.m., with no cover. The ritual of watching the sun go down is enhanced by the prospect of spotting whales from the high terrace of this hotel, a favorite among old-timers. Mariachi bands on Friday nights.</p>
        <p>For live jazz, blues and bossa nova, try Sancho Panza Wine Bar and Bistro, Plaza Las Glorias boardwalk, next to the lighthouse, Cabo San Lucas, (52-114) 33212. Open nightly, Fridays and Saturdays until 2 a.m. with $10 cover. Along with music, it offers an ambitious kitchen and 200 wines, with tastings early Wednesday evenings.</p>

        <p>Correction:  November 19, 2000, Sunday  The What's Doing column on Oct. 22, about Los Cabos, Mexico, at the tip of Baja California, referred incorrectly to the area's size ranking among peninsulas. While reference works give length figures for some peninsulas, geographers say there is no uniform standard to determine exactly where a land mass ends and a peninsula begins. Thus Baja cannot be ranked fourth.</p>
