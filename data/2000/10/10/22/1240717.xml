        <p>IN August, at the big bash that was meant to mark the homecoming of Harriet Beecher Stowe's birthplace in Litchfield, guests clanked cups of a potent rum punch and hooted at the celebratory cannon fire honoring the planned resurrection of the childhood home of the town's most famous native.</p>
        <p>By the start of September, the only celebrating going on was by the project's opponents. Just as Chandler Saint was whirling with enthusiasm over his plan to rebuild the 1774 Beecher house as a museum on a two-acre state-owned lot behind his home on North Street, state officials abruptly withdrew their support of the project. Those who backed away include Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who said he realized local opposition to the project was mounting.</p>
        <p>The main opposition to the museum is that the site lies within the town's one-square-mile historic district, a zone that was created in 1958 to protect its early Federal and Colonial Revival architecture. Museums are not permitted in this district, and any changes to the homes there are allowed only through a stringent special permit process.</p>
        <p>So it seemed that Mr. Saint would have to  find another site outside the historic district to build the museum, and he would have to remove the two 18-wheeler trailers on his lot that are storing the pieces of the Beecher house. Mr. Saint and a partner had saved the house from the wrecking ball in 1997 when they bought it for $1 from Litchfield's Foreman School where it had been used as a dormitory.</p>
        <p>But this is an issue that seems to know no simplicity. Now, the situation has become legally confounded in a way that can best be visualized as an endless Ping-Pong match.  ''It just goes round and round, back and forth,'' Mr. Saint said from his home, the stately Tallmadge House he bought last September for $495,000 with the intention of building the Beecher museum behind it. ''I  am completely baffled by it.''</p>
        <p>Most baffling to some is why the attorney general pulled his support of the North Street site just weeks after attending the Aug. 12 party there, where he gave an inspirational speech about the project and applauded Mr. Saint's hard work ''as a motivating force for making this a reality.''</p>
        <p>Walter and Katherine Odesmith have fought the museum from the beginning. They are Mr. Saint's next-door neighbors. The Odesmith's property and the Tallmadge House property share a driveway, which would have to accommodate the museum traffic.</p>
        <p>Ms. Odesmith said her family and their supporters were ''overjoyed'' when Mr. Blumenthal pulled his support of the North Street site. ''We thought, hallelujah, justice is finally being served,'' she said. ''I thought, now maybe I can have my life back, maybe I'll be able to sleep at night, maybe we can stop depleting our son's educational funds to fight this thing. But guess what. Here we are a month and a half later, and the trailers are still there. Chandler is digging in his heels and ignoring the order of the attorney general. All we ask is that Chandler's super powers be removed and he be made a regular citizen again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal was among several of Connecticut's top-elected officials, including Gov. John G. Rowland, who accepted Mr. Saint's deeding of the two-acre lot behind his home to the State Historical Commission, thereby making the state a partner in the Beecher house restoration project. The deed granted Mr. Saint an easement to proceed with the project and to operate the museum, apparently overriding local zoning regulations. While some hail the state's involvement as a way of pairing government and private operations to accommodate a complicated plan, others condemn it as a way of skirting local zoning laws.</p>
        <p>Public opposition to the North Street site escalated in late August, leading Mr. Blumenthal to make a surprise appearance at an Aug. 31 meeting in Litchfield and declare that the state would not, after all, support the project at the intended site.</p>
        <p>''On behalf of the state, I have no intent or desire to override or challenge local zoning regulations or powers relevant to the location or reconstruction of the Lyman Beecher House,'' Mr. Blumenthal wrote in a Sept. 1 letter to First Selectman Craig Miner. ''Also, unless proper permits or other approvals are obtained from the Town of Litchfield for specific uses of this state property -- including storage of trailers on the present site -- the state will not advocate or defend such action.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview that the state did not exactly change its mind about the site. ''Our position has been constant from the outset that we did not want to use state powers to impose or override the town's land use regulations,'' he said. To get land-use approval for the museum, Mr. Saint would have to be granted a variance that would involve a public hearing process. But Mr. Saint is leaning on another legal opinion that basically dismisses the attorney general's directive.</p>
        <p>The crux of the latest confusion is this: While Mr. Blumenthal, the chief law officer of Connecticut, asserts that the museum project and trailers on North Street violate local zoning laws and asks that an alternate site be found, Litchfield's zoning attorney, Thomas Byrne, says the project and trailers are exempt from local zoning laws because the site is owned by the state and therefore protected by sovereign immunity.</p>
        <p>''As long as this land is owned by a state office and is to be utilized for the construction of the Harriet Beecher Stowe house, that is considered a proper governmental function, and as such, is immune from local zoning regulations,'' Mr. Byrne said. ''I spoke to the office of the attorney general, and I said the only way you guys can resolve this is if you convey the land back to Mr. Saint. They said they'll consider that.''</p>
        <p>Conveying the land back to Mr. Saint through a quitclaim deed is, in fact, just what William Franklin, a lawyer with Cramer &amp; Anderson in Litchfield, requested in a Sept. 21 letter to Mr. Blumenthal. Mr. Franklin represents the Odesmiths, who said they have spent more than $50,000 in legal fees to stop the project.</p>
        <p>By quitclaiming the land back to Mr. Saint, ''all of the parties to this action will be able to stop litigating these questions and instead join together to find an alternative site so that this worthwhile project can proceed in Litchfield,'' Mr. Franklin added.</p>
        <p>But again, things are not so simple.</p>
        <p>In order for the land to be quitclaimed back to Mr. Saint, ''I would have to accept it, wouldn't I?'' Mr. Saint said. Asked if there is any chance he would not accept it, Mr. Saint said, ''There is a strong possibility. I don't think Dick Blumenthal wants to hear that, but there's a strong possibility.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Saint said, ''I have an easement that goes beyond that. The easement says I can go forever on that property and build and operate the museum. You can't quitclaim the easement. I own the easement. They can come up with all of the Machiavellian ideas they want to; I couldn't care less.''</p>
        <p>But according to Pearley Grimes, another Cramer &amp; Anderson lawyer representing the Odesmiths, Mr. Saint is wrong. ''I would say that if the state intends to quitclaim the property back to him, it will be done,'' Mr. Grimes said. ''As far as the easement goes, he owns the easement, that is absolutely correct; but the easement says that he's got to comply with all state and local laws and regulations, and if he doesn't, then the house itself reverts back to the state and his easement becomes null and void.''</p>
        <p>Jack Shanahan, director of the Connecticut Historical Commission, said an effort is under way to identify another site for the museum. ''I guess the thing I fear most is Chandler Saint becoming so frustrated with this whole thing that he gives up altogether,'' Mr. Shanahan said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Saint has suggested that the feuding in Litchfield is so fierce, he may just pack up and build the museum elsewhere. ''There are other towns, other states, other countries,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His first choice, though, remains Litchfield, he said. And toward that end, Mr. Saint is organizing a petition to be sent to social, religious, historic and political leaders around the nation. Titled ''Save The Beecher House,'' the petition outlines the history of Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of the 1852 anti-slavery book, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' and other members of her famous freedom-fighting family who lived in the Beecher  house from 1810 to 1825. It also summarizes the controversy over the intended site and asks for support ''to demonstrate to the politicians in Hartford and Litchfield the historical, cultural and educational significance of the Beechers.''</p>
        <p>Besides signatures, the petition asks for people to become paying members of the Beecher House Society Inc. For donations of $20, $40 or $100, members would get varying degrees of benefits, from a regular newsletter to ''V.I.P. status at ground breaking house openings.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Saint continues to believe there is some way of making the North Street property pan out, he has also agreed, ''in the spirit of cooperation,'' to do a site survey of all other land parcels in town that may be appropriate for housing the future museum.</p>
        <p>''The public interest in preserving this  historic treasure should unite, not divide us,'' said Mr. Blumenthal, who continues to try to preserve the Beecher house. ''Certainly, we have more in common than in conflict.''</p>
