        <p>TWO weeks after Vehronna Smith bought her five-story, five-apartment brownstone on Dean Street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, last March, she slumped onto the old, crooked hallway stairs, wept and said to herself, ''Oh God, what have I done?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith, 32, a singer and writer, had lived with her father and brother in the ground-floor apartment for three years, renting for $875 a month, before jumping at a sudden chance to buy the building.</p>
        <p>That day, two weeks after the closing, she climbed to the top floor, talked with one of her old neighbors/new tenants, and found out that in winter the heat never rose beyond the second floor. ''The tenants froze last year,'' the fledgling landlord said. ''I didn't know because our heat was just fine on the first floor. The boiler wasn't large enough to pull for the entire building; it needed replacing.''</p>
        <p>On the way down, Ms. Smith twisted her ankle on the warped stairs, sat and cried. ''I was thinking I had stumbled into the money pit,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And the boiler was just the beginning.</p>
        <p>Each year, thousands of new homeowners and small landlords in the city and suburbs find they have tumbled into a money pit, buried beneath bills for some unanticipated major expense or tripped by a sudden drop in income because of difficulties like the loss of a job, an illness or divorce.</p>
        <p>To keep those people in their homes, to support the willing but beleaguered landlord and to maintain the quality of housing stock, an array of private and government programs provide assistance -- sometimes independently, often in tandem. The programs offer aid ranging from low-interest loans and debt consolidation to teaching people how to balance their budgets; from a horde of volunteer fixer-uppers descending on needy homes one Saturday morning to teaching a new homeowner how to use a power saw. One organization, in New Britain, Conn., ran what it called a tool lending library, until it discovered that too many tools were too overdue.</p>
        <p>''So many people come to us in some sort of trouble, delinquent,'' said Francine Justa, executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City, a nonprofit group that operates 11 offices in the five boroughs. ''Somebody buys a house for the first time and then they start spending more money on furniture, dishes, supplies, putting themselves further into debt.''</p>
        <p>The rate of homeownership in the United States hit an all-time high during the second quarter of this year -- 67.1 percent -- fueling and, in part, fueled by a significant expansion of the mortgage market.</p>
        <p>There are pitfalls.</p>
        <p>''Part of the big push to expand homeownership has been to adopt less stringent underwriting criteria,'' said George W. McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation. ''Lenders are allowing people to carry much more debt, relative to their income, than they used to. So a lot of mortgages are now written for people who need to pay at least 40 percent of their gross income to pay their debt'' -- leaving them vulnerable to unforeseen expenses.</p>
        <p>That trend is one of the factors that have helped spur foreclosure-prevention programs, both for the individual homeowner and, particularly in the city, the struggling small landlord.</p>
        <p>Some buyers don't understand even the basics of what they are getting into. ''When I first started working in this field,'' said Ms. Justa of Neighborhood Housing Services, ''I got a call from somebody we had just helped into homeownership, and she asked when the man was coming to cut the grass. She had always rented an apartment. I realized we needed to do a little more education.''</p>
        <p>Jerilyn Perine, New York City's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, sees aid to homeowners as part of a larger picture. ''It's part of our overall anti-abandonment strategy,'' she said, ''which for us means preserving buildings, particularly multiple dwellings; keeping them in the hands of owners who are capable, struggling a little, but who with some help could do a good job.'' No small aim of the effort, she said, ''is to ensure that conditions for tenants are appropriate.''</p>
        <p>It took teamwork between Commissioner Perine's department and Ms. Justa's Neighborhood Housing Services to, figuratively at least, lift Ms. Smith off that warped staircase.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith and her family moved into the brownstone on Dean Street in April 1997. Three days later, her mother died ''in the middle of the living room,'' she said, ''before we even had a phone.''</p>
        <p>Over the next three years, the building changed hands three times -- the last, with Ms. Smith buying it for $350,000, on March 24. ''I bought it, honestly,'' she said, ''because, with it being the last place that my mom was alive, sometimes you have to listen to that voice even if you don't understand. The voice is saying, 'Do this, it will pay off later.' ''</p>
        <p>And beyond that inner urging, there was the very concrete revival of the neighborhood. ''The area is rising so much,'' Ms. Smith said. ''Every week there are people coming who have literally been priced out of Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>But first there was that feeble boiler to deal with, and those stairs. ''And the windows are cheap and leaky,'' Ms. Smith continued -- and continued. ''The apartment doors are glorified bedroom doors. Floors are crooked, just carpeted over. Kitchens and bathrooms need to be updated. The backyard needs a fence. The back of the house needs new pointing. And those hall stairs are going to be completely replaced, new banisters.''</p>
        <p>A lot of money was needed. ''Conventional lenders don't even want to talk about a renovation to someone who has owned a building for less than three years,'' Ms. Smith said. ''And if you can convince one, you're going to have an interest rate almost double the mortgage; someone mentioned 15 to 18 percent.''</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Smith saw a cable-television news story about how the housing department offers low-interest loans to owners interested in rehabilitating their properties. ''My property was definitely sickly, on life support,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Five days after Ms. Smith made the call -- to (212) 863-5300 -- a financial analyst from the department's Owner Services Program inspected her property, contacted Neighborhood Housing Services and began arranging an $82,500 renovation loan at 8 percent interest over 30 years.</p>
        <p>''They gave me a list of approved contractors,'' Ms. Smith said. ''I interviewed a dozen until I found someone I was comfortable with. I even went to see a sample of his work. He handles everything from wood to metal to sheetrock to plumbing to heating and electric.'' Work is to begin within a month, with the agencies monitoring progress.</p>
        <p>''They are directly responsible for me seeing it as a dream house, instead of a nightmare,'' Ms. Smith said.</p>
        <p>FINANCIAL assistance arranged through the housing department can help dissipate anything from a nightmare to an annoyance. ''We have little loans, up to $7,500 per unit, at 1 percent interest, under the Code Compliance Loan Program,'' Commissioner Perine said. ''It's there to remove code violations or replace one building system.''</p>
        <p>There are also ''deeper subsidies,'' she said, under the Participation Loan Program (participation with a bank), for extensive rehabilitation, typically in buildings of 20 units or more.</p>
        <p>''An owner comes to us,'' Ms. Perine said. ''We go through a review. The bank does the actual underwriting. We add our money into the bank loan, at 1 percent. The bank has its own market rate. We will sometimes lend up to 50 percent. So the outcome is a below-market loan to complete a very substantial rehabilitation. Generally, we're seeing rehab work at $40,000 to $50,000 per unit.''</p>
        <p>''And there are three other loan programs in between those extremes,'' she said. The department also offers free classes for landlords on property management, finances, building systems, and energy, heat and water conservation.</p>
        <p>The frequency with which neophyte home buyers and close-to-the-profit-margin landlords slip into financial trouble has been exacerbated -- perhaps ironically in the robust housing economy -- by the ready availability of financing for what the mortgage industry refers to as the nation's traditionally ''underserved'' population.</p>
        <p>''There has been a marked increase in the availability of mortgage financing, both in the conventional market and from subprime sources,'' said Naomi Bayer, director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home-financing corporation. Subprime mortgages are offered at higher than conventional interest rates to people with less than stellar credit histories.</p>
        <p>''There's been a proliferation of subprime lending over the last five years,'' Ms. Bayer said. ''There's a market for it, and there are investors willing to provide capital.''</p>
        <p>In fact, according to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, 14.9 percent -- or 2.1 million -- of all mortgages originated in the United States in 1999 went to subprime borrowers. ''Over 90 percent of subprime loans have been made in the last six years,'' Ms. Bayer said, ''and the subprime market has grown roughly 30 percent each year over the previous year during that time.''</p>
        <p>Despite the record length of the nation's economic growth, mortgage foreclosure rates have risen steadily in recent years. In 1980, for example, the default rate for conventional mortgages was 0.25 percent; in 1990 it was 0.83 percent and last year it was 1.02 percent.</p>
        <p>''That would be around half a million foreclosures a year just for conventional mortgages,'' Dr. McCarthy at the Ford Foundation said.</p>
        <p>When combined with defaults for federally insured mortgages and subprime mortgages, which go into foreclosure at a rate of 6 percent a year, Dr. McCarthy calculated, there were more than 1 million defaults in 1999.</p>
        <p>''That's a lot,'' he said. ''Granted we have 70 million homeowners, but still a million is a lot of defaults, especially in a robust economy.''</p>
        <p>For Yanick Charles, who once found herself teetering near the financial brink, it is little things -- like the window-well cover she installed herself -- that are keeping her and her 9-year-old daughter, Gina, in their three-bedroom brick home in the Clifton section of Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Ms. Charles, 47, a single mother, has taken every foreclosure-prevention course offered by Neighborhood Housing Services, including the 10-week home maintenance workshop taught by Carlton Brathwaite. ''It's a hands-on program,'' she said. ''We did electrical wiring, a little plumbing, working with sheetrock, installing parquet floors, working with power tools.''</p>
        <p>''Prevention is better than a cure,'' she said. ''And if what I can do is not enough, I know my limits and call an expert.''</p>
        <p>Only five years ago, caught in a squeeze, Ms. Charles was way beyond her limits -- ''a couple of tens of thousands'' in debt after using her credit cards to pay mortgage bills.</p>
        <p>AFTER renting the top floor of a two-family house in Jamaica, Queens -- ''My baby wants to run, the people downstairs complain and I cannot hold her,'' she said -- Ms. Charles paid $115,000 for the house on Staten Island, with 20 percent down and a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at 6.25 percent.</p>
        <p>''I had my parents living with me then,'' the native of Haiti said. ''They were both stroke patients, incapacitated. So, between my parents' pensions and my salary, I managed the household.''</p>
        <p>By 1995, however, both parents had to go into nursing homes. And then Ms. Charles lost her bookkeeping job. ''I became sole proprietor with the same expenses and no income,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And even after she was hired by S.I. Bank and Trust (S.I. for Staten Island), the hole deepened. ''Between home expenses and day-care costs for the rest of the afternoon, I reached a point where this paycheck was not covering everything,'' she said. ''My last resort was to use somebody else's money -- the card.''</p>
        <p>Finally, last December, ''before the year 2000 kicks in,'' she said, ''I decided to clean up my act.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Charles contacted the American Credit Alliance, a nonprofit organization that helps people consolidate their debt. ''They negotiated with my creditors to have some of the rates lowered,'' she said, ''and now they collect a set amount from me every month, $638, and dispatch the payments to each creditor. So I don't have them calling me.''</p>
        <p>''It's the better way to control things than paying 18 to 20 percent -- sometimes 24 percent -- on each of the credit cards,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And over the last two years, Ms. Charles has taken courses in how to shop wisely, how to avoid foreclosure, fire prevention, water-damage prevention, insurance coverage and the myriad facets of home maintenance.</p>
        <p>''It gives me confidence,'' she said, ''and I'm optimistic that I can fix a situation, that they are temporary setbacks.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone can fix a situation themselves. And so, along with about 100 groups across the country, volunteers from the Neighborhood Housing Services branch in New Britain, Conn., participate in Christmas in April.</p>
        <p>''We take people from a local business or a church and, with volunteer labor and donations, renovate 20 houses a year, all on one Saturday,'' said Christine Traczyk, the director of New Britain housing services.</p>
        <p>A committee reviews applications from elderly and low-income homeowners. ''Every house is different,'' Ms. Traczyk said. Some require painting, others need a new floor, a window or a door. ''We've done two roofs, kitchens, bathrooms,'' she said. ''One year we completely constructed a deck on a home for physically challenged people.''</p>
        <p>''Twenty-five to 30 volunteers descend on this homeowner at 8 in the morning,'' Ms. Traczyk said. ''And about 5 o'clock, we all gather for a big picnic.''</p>
        <p>Not even counting the social value of keeping people in their homes, the cost effectiveness derived from the panoply of foreclosure-prevention programs was indicated by a study conducted over the last five years by the Family Housing Fund of Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>Between 1991 and last December, said Pam Zagaria, its vice president, the fund and three other groups provided foreclosure counseling and, often, financial assistance to 2,265 households. ''Of those, 1,073 had their mortgages reinstated,'' Ms. Zagaria said.</p>
        <p>The program's total cost by the end of 1999 was $3.3 million.</p>
        <p>''We divided that by the number of mortgages reinstated,'' Ms. Zagaria said, ''and the average program cost for each reinstated mortgage was $3,075.''</p>
        <p>''Then,'' she said, ''we calculated the total savings -- to the homeowner in terms of equity, the unreimbursed costs to the lender, to the loan insurer, to the loan servicer, to the city if a house becomes vacant and boarded, and the decline in property values -- and it ranged from $27,000 to $75,000.''</p>
        <p>There is no way to calculate the savings, emotional as well as financial, reaped by Myla Jones after she received support from the Long Island Housing Partnership.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jones, 36, a teacher from Copiague in Suffolk County, is raising her four children herself. Her estranged husband, she said, has barely helped with child support or payments on the three-bedroom ranch.</p>
        <p>''Four kids,'' she said, ''and I was trying to pay the mortgage, a car loan, food, you name it; credit cards. By '98, I owed five months, and I'm drawing from savings to make the payments.''</p>
        <p>To avoid foreclosure, Ms. Jones declared bankruptcy and underwent debt reorganization, requiring her to pay $1,000 a month. ''Unfortunately, I couldn't keep up those payments,'' she said, and eventually owed $18,000. To consolidate that debt, Ms. Jones went to a mortgage broker.</p>
        <p>AND then she heard about the Long Island Housing Partnership. ''I went in and they helped me,'' she said. ''I learned that the loan from the mortgage company was exorbitant -- 13 percent and a whole lot of points.'' The monthly payments would have been $1,400 for 30 years. ''I couldn't afford the other payments, so how was I going to make that?''</p>
        <p>One staff member at the partnership, Carol Woods, ''started making calls,'' Ms. Jones said, ''renegotiating with Astoria Federal.'' The original rate of 9 percent was lowered to 8 percent, and the back payments were incorporated, ''so I could start new,'' Ms. Jones said.</p>
        <p>The new payments were $1,050 -- $50 more than on the first loan. ''But I can handle it,'' Ms. Jones said, crediting another partnership worker, Diane Patrizio, with providing one-on-one budget counseling.</p>
        <p>''She showed how I could stay on track,'' Ms. Jones said, ''cutting it down to bare necessities. Like cable; I don't have cable. We get free videotapes from the library. I hang clothes on the line.''</p>
        <p>It was a hard lesson, Ms. Jones said, ''a horrible feeling not knowing if you're going to lose your home; I lost a lot of sleep. But they kept in touch, constantly calling, reassuring me.</p>
        <p>''Now I know what I'm dealing with.''</p>
