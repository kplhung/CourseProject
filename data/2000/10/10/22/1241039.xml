        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Numbers,'' was released Friday by Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate from New Jersey, in his campaign against Representative Bob Franks.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Shrum, Devine &amp; Donilon</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with the same videotape of Mr. Franks against a black background used in all of Mr. Corzine's other attack ads. Beneath the blurry, washed-out, slow-motion image of Mr. Franks, captions flash on screen in bright blue, echoing the voice-over: ''Bob Franks and his special interest supporters,'' ''Negative ads,'' ''Not true,'' followed by quotations from news articles in The New York Times and The Star-Ledger of Newark. Then, the sinister-sounding electronic music gives way to Mr. Corzine's guitar-strumming, feel-good campaign soundtrack, and Mr. Corzine is shown writing at a desk and talking to students in a school and to an older woman. The captions here label Mr. Corzine a ''successful businessman'' who ''supports fiscal responsibility,'' and promises that his spending plans can be accomplished ''without raising taxes.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''Bob Franks and his special-interest supporters -- their negative ads attacking Jon Corzine are not true. The New York Times calls their latest ad 'substantially misleading.' The Star-Ledger says the cost of Jon Corzine's proposals are 'nowhere near Franks's inflated number.' Jon Corzine has worked with real numbers, created jobs and balanced budgets his whole life. He supports a fiscally responsible plan that invests in education and protects Social Security without raising taxes.</p>
        <p>''Corzine for Senate.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The ad accurately quotes from the newspapers it cites. The quotation from The Times was in an analysis of an ad paid for by the Republican Leadership Council, which relied on numbers from the House Budget Committee, of which Mr. Franks is a member. The quotation from The Star-Ledger came from an analysis of Mr. Corzine's spending proposals; notably, the same article also said Mr. Corzine had underestimated the costs of his plans by about half.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- With this ad, Mr. Corzine does his best to counter the charge by Mr. Franks that may resonate the most with voters in a famously tax-sensitive state: that Mr. Corzine's eagerness to spend money to solve social problems would lead him to bankrupt the government or else raise taxes. The ad is laced with palliative phrases: ''successful businessman,'' ''balanced budgets,'' ''fiscally responsible,'' and most of all, ''without raising taxes.''  In addition, by lumping Mr. Franks with special interests, Mr. Corzine shows he is aware that polls show that voters are more concerned about politicians who are indebted to corporations and other campaign contributors than they are about wealthy candidates who spend large amounts of their own money. The ad also neatly illustrates Mr. Corzine's huge monetary advantage in the campaign. Mr. Franks, who has been beset by fund-raising problems, was forced to wait until last week to run his first statewide TV commercials. Republican allies like the Republican Leadership Council placed a small number of commercials on Mr. Franks's behalf, but those ads will have been seen by far fewer voters than will see the ubiquitous commercials Mr. Corzine is using to respond to the council's ads.</p>
