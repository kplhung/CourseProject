        <p>Coincidentally, I purchased Jennifer Allen's book the day her article appeared in your magazine (Sept. 24). The article tells us a lot about the facts surrounding George Allen's career and his professional relationship with the owners. It tells even more about the character of Ms. Allen. At a time when speaking ill of the dead is in vogue, she hasn't written a ''Daddy Dearest,'' but rather a fair portrayal of a man who ''only wanted to coach.''</p>
