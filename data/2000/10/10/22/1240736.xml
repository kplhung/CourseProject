        <p>RICHARD FOOT, executive director of the Westport/Weston Y.M.C.A., unlatched the gate on Richmondville Avenue that leads to the Y.M.C.A.'s hidden treasure. There it was -- Lees Pond Dam, a 17-foot-high stone dam spanning the Saugatuck River a mile north of the Post Road.</p>
        <p>''A sparkling jewel,'' Mr. Foot said. The 200-foot-wide dam creates Lees Pond, an eight-acre mini-lake in a residential neighborhood just south of the Merritt Parkway. The dam and pond were gifts to the Y.M.C.A. 25 years ago, and the Y.M.C.A. is ensuring that they will remain a recreational gem for canoeing, fishing and ice skating for years to come.</p>
        <p>The Y.M.C.A. is leading a $150,000 restoration of the dam, 20 years after the United States Army Corps of Engineers recommended fixing it during a nationwide inventory and inspection of non-federal dams. The renovation should begin next month and be completed in about six weeks.</p>
        <p>While the dam is overhauled, the State Department of Environmental Protection will repair a fishway for migratory fish that can't swim over a terraced stone wall on their journey from salt to fresh water. And the Nutmeg Chapter of Trout Unlimited, a national conservation organization, will build an eel pass inside the fishway. Juvenile American eels need fresh water to grow to their 40-inch adult length.</p>
        <p>The Y.M.C.A. is paying the bulk of the cost -- $120,000. The remaining $30,000 comes from a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, applied for by the Westport Department of Fire Services.</p>
        <p>''It's very easy to put resources and money into programs and projects that are highly visible. This isn't one of them,'' said Denis M. McCarthy, the deputy fire chief at the Westport Department of Fire Services' Office of Emergency Management. ''But it's one of those projects that absolutely had to be resolved as part of the Y.M.C.A.'s stewardship in the community.''</p>
        <p>In 1980, Lees Pond Dam was one of 365 Connecticut dams that the Army Corps examined, and field engineers noted that the dam was ''in poor condition.'' For example, water was seeping through missing stones and grout, and the hollow roots of dead trees had become conduits for water. The engineers advised the Y.M.C.A. to fix the dam within a year.</p>
        <p>''We just did the Phase I study and highlighted those dams that had  problems and recommended that the state follow up,'' said Charles Wener, chief of the water management section of the New England District of the Army Corps of Engineers. ''We had no ability to fine anybody.''</p>
        <p>The Corps classified Lees Pond Dam as low-hazard, which meant that if the dam gave way, the engineers did not expect deaths or massive business losses.</p>
        <p>Still, when Mr. Foot became the new director of the Westport/Weston Y.M.C.A. four years ago, he decided to get the dam fixed. ''We are a corporate citizen in this town, and as the owner of the dam we feel it is the right thing to do to restore it.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Foot called on the engineering firm of Milone &amp; MacBroom of Cheshire to inspect the dam again -- at the Y.M.C.A.'s expense -- to see if it had further deteriorated since 1980. Then, he asked Milone &amp; MacBroom to prepare engineering drawings for the reconstruction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foot has been leading the restoration and the Y.M.C.A. is using money from its capital budget to pay for the repairs, but the project is a community effort. Though the Army Corps of Engineers classified Lees Pond as a low-hazard dam, there was still a small possibility that the dam could flood downtown businesses if it were to collapse or be overwhelmed by water. That brought the Mid-Fairfield County Chapter of the American Red Cross and the Westport Department of Fire to endorse the Y.M.C.A.'s repairs.</p>
        <p>The fire department applied for the grant to repair the dam's sluice gate, which can release water from the pond when heavy rains or a hurricane are expected, to prevent overwhelming pressure on the dam. ''Our concern is that the dam is most at risk during a period when the downstream community can least afford additional water,'' Mr. McCarthy  said. ''It may be a low hazard, but it's not completely benign.''</p>
        <p>In 1977, a private, earthen dam washed out in a small town in northeast Georgia, killing 39 people. President Jimmy Carter was so moved by the disaster in his home state that he ordered the federal inventory and dam survey. He wanted to pinpoint all the decrepit dams and prevent any further loss of life.</p>
        <p>Though Lees Pond Dam was not deemed a significant hazard, Mr. Foot knew that the Army Corps of Engineers' report shouldn't be ignored. He had previously been president and chief executive officer of the Cambridge Family Y.M.C.A. in Massachusetts before taking the job in Westport. The Cambridge Family Y.M.C.A. owned a camp on a lake in Dunstable with an earthen dam downstream, and Mr. Foot oversaw its repair as well. He recalled that when he learned about the inspection report on Lees Pond Dam, he said, ''I can't ignore this; this is something we need to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Other organizations wanted to join in. One was Trout Unlimited, which wanted to make sure that the pond would remain deep enough to be a refuge for fish during drought conditions, and that the dam would have an eel pass. ''The overall ecological health of the river will be improved,'' said David Moxhay, a past president of Trout Unlimited.</p>
        <p>Two Westport businessmen built the dam in 1815 to generate water power for a cotton yarn mill. It blocked the path of migratory fish, such as river herring. In the 1950's the mill closed, and two Westport residents -- Leo Nevas, an attorney, and Nat Greenberg, a hardware store owner -- bought the factory, pond and dam. In 1975, they sold the pond and dam to the Westport/Weston Y.M.C.A. for use with its Camp Mahackeno upstream.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCarthy commended Mr. Foot and the Y.M.C.A. board of directors for repairing the dam. ''It's a tremendous undertaking that doesn't yield a lot of visible benefits to the Y.M.C.A., but it's certainly an important project,'' he said.</p>
