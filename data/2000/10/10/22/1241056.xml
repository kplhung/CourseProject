        <p>For four hours on the undercard of Friday night's Mike Tyson-Andrew Golota heavyweight fight, a series of little-known boxers, several bloodied and bruised, raised themselves from a wooden stool in the corner of the ring and continued bouts they were sure to lose.</p>
        <p>This procession included the junior welterweight Hector Quiroz, who fought with one eye shut and a grisly purple cheek until his bout with the champion Zab Judah was stopped. It included Kendra Lenhart, from Lenoir, Tenn., whose face was red and swollen and whose arms were marked with raw welts and scraps.</p>

        <p>For four hours on the undercard of Friday night's Mike Tyson-Andrew Golota heavyweight fight, a series of little-known boxers, several bloodied and bruised, raised themselves from a wooden stool in the corner of the ring and continued bouts they were sure to lose.</p>
        <p>This procession included the junior welterweight Hector Quiroz, who fought with one eye shut and a grisly purple cheek until his bout with the champion Zab Judah was stopped. It included Kendra Lenhart, from Lenoir, Tenn., whose face was red and swollen and whose arms were marked with raw welts and scraps.</p>
        <p>Laila Ali, the daughter of Muhammad Ali, would win a decision over Lenhart, who for her fearlessness was paid less than someone successfully answering the easy questions from Regis Philbin on television.</p>
        <p>And then, near midnight in the main event, there was Golota, who with his $2.2 million purse deposited somewhere, pushed his diminutive cornermen out of his way after just two rounds, told the referee, ''I quit,'' and all but ran from the ring.</p>
        <p>It is not easy to turn Tyson into a stunned fighter, one staring across the ring wondering what bizarre thing is going on in the other corner, but in this bout, Golota proved that even in boxing there is always room under the big top for another carnival act.</p>
        <p>Tyson left the ring early this morning at The Palace, without speaking to reporters, leaving behind his suggestions during the last week that he was going to retire.</p>
        <p>Tyson's manager, Shelly Finkel, said Tyson left feeling ''unfulfilled.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know, but that may leave him thinking, 'I can do better,' '' Finkel said.</p>
        <p>Lennox Lewis, who holds two of three heavyweight titles, said today in a conference call with reporters that he was not taking Tyson's retirement talk seriously. ''I don't listen to what Tyson says; it's like listening to a madman,'' Lewis said. ''I believe the money to have one more big fight will be too great. I hope he waits for me. I'm sure there's a little bit of food for me to eat.''</p>
        <p>The current obstacle to such a fight is that Lewis and Tyson are aligned with different, competing television entities -- Lewis with HBO and Tyson with Showtime. One would have to agree to allow its fighter to appear on the other's network for the two to meet in the ring.</p>
        <p>Lewis today stepped up the pressure on Tyson to make a deal, saying he wanted to defeat Tyson ''to get rid of the sport's No. 1 misfit.''</p>
        <p>''People want this fight,'' Lewis said, ''because they want me to beat him for the good of the sport.''</p>
        <p>Upon returning home to Chicago today, Golota went to a hospital, and his career may be over, at least as a part of major fights in the United States. He was was complaining of head pain and nausea and was under observation for a concussion, The Associated Press said.</p>
        <p>Golota, 32, has quit in two major fights. He declined to continue a bout he was winning against Michael Grant after he was knocked down in the 10th.</p>
        <p>As Lewis said: ''We're supposed to go out on our shields. We're not supposed to go out there for one round then say, 'Thanks for the money,' and leave.''</p>
        <p>The fight was not without action or revealing moments. Tyson was more in control of his emotions in the ring, and just before the first round ended, he threw a solid, straight right hand that floored Golota. Seconds before, a head butt by Tyson had opened a cut above Golota's left eye. Golota's trainers, Al Certo and Lou Duva, said Golota wanted to quit after the first round but they pushed him back into the ring.</p>
        <p>Tyson scored with lefts and rights early in the second round, opening a cut on Golota's nose. But by the middle of the second round, Tyson had stopped throwing combinations and appeared unsettled by Golota, who was fighting back.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly between rounds, Golota walked to Referee Frank Garza and told him he was quitting. Duva jumped in Golota's way, trying to force Golota's mouthpiece into the fighter's mouth, but Golota kept his lips firmly pressed together.</p>
        <p>Once in the hallway beneath the stands, Golota passed Kendra Lenhart, who stood against the wall in a dressy, matching outfit, a layer of makeup mostly masking her bruised left cheek.</p>
