        <p>RESIDENTS of seven Westchester communities will vote next month on an estimated $15 million worth of bond initiatives and tax increases intended to preserve open space.</p>
        <p>The proposals -- in Bedford, Irvington, Lewisboro, North Salem, Pound Ridge, Somers and Yorktown -- have received bipartisan support, with many residents viewing them as a way to preserve the character of their communities.</p>
        <p>Nationally, such initiatives have had a 90 percent success rate with voters, said Chris Wells, public finance manager at the mid-Atlantic office of the Trust for Public Land.</p>
        <p>The speed with which the open space movement has developed in northern Westchester is breathtaking. For many of the communities, the last 10 months have been a blur of coalition building, citizen surveys, public hearings and town or village board meetings. The Westchester Land Trust, working through the Westchester Open Space Alliance, has played a major role in coordinating the efforts.</p>
        <p>And while the wording and approaches to the open space referendums are as diverse as the towns themselves -- some involve tax increases, others involve bond issues -- the widespread support for the initiatives has taken both advocates and town officials by surprise.</p>
        <p>''We thought the timing was good to do this in conjunction with the other towns,'' said Linda G. Cooper, the Yorktown supervisor. ''It's a chance for voters to decide on the landscape they want. Whether they want to preserve its rural character or make it an urban county.''</p>
        <p>George D. Bianco, chairman of the Open Space Committee of the Bedford Coalition, said: ''The thing that I find amazing is that people are working together from different political parties. They may not agree on much, but they agree on this. It's reverberating through all the communities.''</p>
        <p>In a survey conducted earlier this year by the town of Bedford, three-quarters of the respondents said they would pay at least $100 more in taxes annually to preserve the community's character.</p>
        <p>In Lewisboro, where fields from 19th-century farms provide much of the area's character, some aesthetic and economic factors led the Town Board to realize the importance of open space, said Susan Henry, a leader of the Lewisboro Open Space Coalition.</p>
        <p>She said that after Lewisboro's Conservation Advisory Council conducted an inventory, it was found that at least 29 parcels of open space were available for development. Developing those parcels, she said, would seriously fragment three green corridors in town.</p>
        <p>Other factors in Lewisboro, like an increase in traffic and crowding in the schools, gave residents pause. ''It made people think that if the development continues at the same pace, we would be faced with building new schools,'' Mrs. Henry said.</p>
        <p>In North Salem, town officials say the taxes from one high-end house will pay for one new student in the school, said Cynthia Curtis, a Town Board member. But most of the larger houses have at least three or four bedrooms, so the tax revenue is not covering the cost of the extra students attending the schools, she said.</p>
        <p>''And, it's a big hit on the environment,'' Mrs. Curtis added. ''When you build that much impermeable surface, the water has to go somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Traditionally, North Salem is divided politically and economically between the large estate and horse farm owners on the west side of town and the more populated subdivisions on the east side, said Jeff Morris, co-chairman of the North Salem Land Preservation Alliance. Both sides, he said, have united on the issue of land preservation.</p>
        <p>''There's been popular support and political support for something that had previously been a divisive issue,'' Mr. Morris said. ''It's not just a west side issue.''</p>
        <p>The only community with organized opposition to the open space proposal is Pound Ridge, where residents have formed a group called Friends, Neighbors, Taxpayers and Voters.</p>
        <p>Bob Powers, a leader in the group who has lived in Pound Ridge for 34 years, said, ''There are a lot of people working with me who are former Planning Board members, older residents and newer residents, who feel this is not a necessary expenditure of money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers, a former member of the Town Board and and the Zoning Board, said the group does not believe a dedicated land use fund will do anything of substance to protect the environment.</p>
        <p>The proposal would cost the average taxpayer in Pound Ridge a dollar for every $10,000 of assessed value of their property, said Ray Smith, the chairman of the Pound Ridge Open Space Preservation Coalition. In 1998 the average property was assessed at $154,000, so the average annual contribution to the fund, for each property, would be $154.</p>
        <p>In a letter mailed to Pound Ridge residents, the opposition group argued that Pound Ridge has the most open space of any town in northern Westchester and the lowest population density, the town boards provide ample protection for drinking water and wetlands and Dann Farms, off Barnegat Road, will be the last major subdivision the town will approve.</p>
        <p>A third of Pound Ridge's open space is concentrated in the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, but Clay Fowler, the chairman of the Planning Board in Pound Ridge, said there was considerable pressure to develop south of the park.</p>
        <p>''Dann Farms is the last major subdivision that is currently being contemplated,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean that there won't be another subdivision. I don't think anyone can say that.''</p>
        <p>Open-space advocates in Irvington, the only village among the seven that is on the Hudson River, are conducting a catch-up campaign to win support.</p>
        <p>A proposed $3 million bond issue was adopted by the Village Board just seven weeks before the election, said Nicola Coddington, co-chairwoman of the Open Space Alliance.</p>
        <p>''We've had to go from 0 to 60 to pull together a volunteer organization to educate the voters and get the vote out,'' Ms. Coddington said. ''It's really a very simple issue, and part of our job is educating the public that so much of this land is unprotected and will not stay the same as it is.''</p>
