        <p>The Mets lost this morning, and they may want to take some time before tonight's second game of the World Series and review the baseball rule book. A refresher course on the definition of a fair ball is in order. Todd Zeile and Jay Payton, in particular, could benefit from turning to Page 16. Come to think of it, the Mets could use a refresher course on base running in general before Game 2.</p>
        <p>The Mets, in Game 1 last night, were guilty of four base-running blunders in the first six innings, one of which cost them a run in a scoreless game. That blunder belonged to Timo Perez, the rookie sensation from the Mets' pennant-winning series against St. Louis, and it was the most grievous.</p>
        <p>By failing to run hard on what he thought -- incorrectly -- was a Todd Zeile home run, Perez was thrown out at the plate for the third out of the sixth inning. The play was critical at the time, because the game was scoreless, and it turned out to be critical at the end of the game, because the Mets lost, 4-3, in 12 innings and 4 hours 51 minutes, in the longest World Series game played and the first World Series game between New York teams since 1956.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Zeile and Payton failed to run out fair rollers, thinking they were foul, and Mike Piazza was picked off first base. Why Piazza had strayed far enough to be picked off was inexplicable. He had stolen only four times in six tries during the season, and Andy Pettitte has one of the best pickoff moves in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>Perez got himself in trouble by thinking Zeile's fly ball to left field was a home run.</p>
        <p>When Zeile hit the pitch from Pettitte, Perez broke quickly from first. As he reached the midway point between first and second, however, Perez, who had led off with a single, slowed down to the pace of a home run trot. Signaling home run, he continued on that pace until he reached midway between second and third and suddenly realized the ball was in play.</p>
        <p>Zeile drove the ball to the top of the left field fence, but contrary to the way Perez and other members of the Mets saw it, the hit did not qualify as a home run. Instead, it appeared to strike the edge where the vertical part of the fence meets the top.</p>
        <p>The ball came back onto the field, and David Justice quickly retrieved it. He threw to Derek Jeter, the relay man, and Jeter fired a one-bouncer to the plate. Perez, dumbstruck that he was not going to score uncontested, had shifted back into third gear, but Jorge Posada neatly blocked the plate, caught Jeter's throw and tagged Perez.</p>
        <p>''I thought the ball was going out,'' Perez said later, speaking in Spanish. ''I wasn't running at 100 percent. I waved my arm. I don't know if I got confused with the fans. I lost a couple of steps and maybe I would not have been out as easily.''</p>
        <p>Perez, without using the popular baseball term, admitted to having made a rookie mistake. ''Those are things that happen to someone with little experience,'' he said. ''For that to happen to me again, it will be very different.''</p>
        <p>The Mets protested briefly that Zeile should have had a home run. Bobby Valentine came out of the dugout signaling home run as he approached the umpires. But they did not agree with the manager, and television replays indicated the ball never left the playing field. After the play at the plate, Zeile himself wandered between second and third, uncertain about what had happened.</p>
        <p>''When I hit it, I thought it had a chance,'' Zeile said. ''For my line of sight, it disappeared for a split second so I thought it was gone. It actually shocked me to see the ball coming in. I thought it had disappeared behind the fence. The umpires apparently were on it because the guys who saw the replay said it hit very high on the fence.''</p>
        <p>Perez's gaffe will not be corrected by a review of the rule book. But it falls under the category of running fast and hard until an umpire signals something that allows the runner to slow down or stop running altogether. Little Leaguers everywhere are taught that. But Zeile and Payton apparently forgot that bit of baseball education, which is why they might want to do some light reading in the rule book.</p>
        <p>There, in Section 2.00, ''Definitions of Terms,'' they will find the following start of this definition: ''A fair ball is a batted ball that settles on fair ground between home and first base, or between home and third base. . . .''</p>
        <p>Perhaps Valentine should have Zeile and Payton write it on a blackboard 100 times or so, just to make sure they know it so they will know when to run to first base instead of standing in the batter's box watching the ball roll along the ground. Zeile, in the fourth inning, and Payton, in the fifth, were guilty of watching.</p>
        <p>Zeile hit a dribbler that rolled into foul territory next to the third-base line. But suddenly the ball took a right turn and began rolling across the dirt toward the line. Then it crossed the line, back into fair territory. Scott Brosius, so good at charging slowly hit grounders and throwing out the batter, did not have to hurry. He scooped up the ball and threw to first for the out.</p>
        <p>In the fifth inning, Payton went to bat after Benny Agbayani led off with a double. He swung at a Pettitte pitch and drove it into the ground. The ball bounced behind the plate, then rolled into the left-handed side of the batter's box, then into fair territory several feet along the first base line. Posada pounced on it, spun around and tagged Payton, who remained standing in the right-handed side of the batter's box.</p>
        <p>Payton protested to Ed Montague, the plate umpire, that he should not be out, but Montague told him those were the rules of the game.</p>
        <p>Zeile and Payton might have been out even if they had run, but by standing still they made the plays easy for the Yankees who were throwing the ball. A hurried, errant throw, especially with Agbayani at second, could have been disastrous for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>As it turned out in that inning, Todd Pratt and Mike Bordick struck out, leaving Agbayani at second without another batter leaving the batter's box.</p>
