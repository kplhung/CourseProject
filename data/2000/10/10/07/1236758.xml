        <p>The gloomy weather in Atlanta this morning fit the mood of the Braves, a proud team that was on the verge of another playoff failure.</p>
        <p>Despite winning nine consecutive division titles, Atlanta has won only one World Series, when it defeated the Cleveland Indians in 1995. The biggest criticism of the Braves has been that despite their consistency during the regular season, they have not been nearly as good in the postseason.</p>
        <p>That pattern has continued so far this year. Defeated by the St. Louis Cardinals, 10-4, on Thursday, the Braves trail their three-of-five-game division series, 2-0, heading into Game 3 on Saturday afternoon at Turner Field. After seeing the Cardinals pound his two best pitchers in Game 1 and Game 2, Braves Manager Bobby Cox announced today that Kevin Millwood would start Game 3, facing Garrett Stephenson (16-9) of St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Can Millwood (10-13) shut down the Cardinals? His higher-profile teammates, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, failed to do so in the first two games. Millwood faces a difficult task, trying to contain a St. Louis team that has generated 17 runs in the two games, led by Jim Edmonds and Will Clark. Edmonds is 6 for 9 in the series with three doubles and four runs batted in. Clark has also driven in four runs, three with a homer against Glavine in Game 2.</p>
        <p>Asked how he would approach the St. Louis lineup, Millwood smiled and said, ''Stay away from Clark.''</p>
        <p>That's a good idea. Clark has hit like Babe Ruth against Millwood in his career: 5 for 8, with four homers. Those are hardly the kind of statistics that will make Millwood confident against Clark, but the St. Louis first baseman tried to play down his success.</p>
        <p>''Kevin's got great stuff, but I've been able to put the ball in play, and a few of those have gone out of the park,'' Clark said. ''Hitting is hitting. When it crosses that little white dish, you have to hack at it.''</p>
        <p>The Cardinals have been hacking away, putting the Braves on the defensive. Atlanta's current skid actually started on the final day of the regular season, when the Braves blew a ninth-inning lead, lost to Colorado and lost home-field advantage for the first round of the playoffs. It is hard to imagine that the Cardinals would have jumped on the Braves so soundly if the first two games had been played at Turner Field, where Atlanta was 51-30 this year. But starting at Busch Stadium with their enthusiastic fans gave the Cardinals an edge.</p>
        <p>Is there any reason to believe the Braves will come back? Actually, they have done it before. In 1996, the Braves trailed St. Louis, 3-1, in the National League Championship Series, but Atlanta stormed back to win three consecutive games to take the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>Current Braves who were also on the 1996 team, like Chipper Jones, reflected on that comeback for inspiration. ''We've done it before, so we know we can do it,'' Jones said. ''But it's going to be difficult. We're facing an excellent club that is very hot.''</p>
        <p>If the Braves can win Game 3, it will allow Cox to pitch Maddux again in Game 4, followed by Glavine if a Game 5 is necessary.</p>
        <p>Millwood has not been the same pitcher who won 17 games in 1997 and 18 games in 1999. Millwood's earned run average, 4.66, was the highest in his three-year career, and in his only decision against the Cardinals this year, he lost.</p>
        <p>Cox had contemplated starting Maddux in Game 3 on three days' rest, then decided against it.</p>
        <p>On the verge of elimination, the Braves hoped that a victory Saturday would change the momentum of the series. The Braves were desperately in need of a solid performance from Millwood, and he looked forward to the challenge. ''It's about helping your team in a rough situation,'' he said. ''Tomorrow, I have that chance.''</p>
