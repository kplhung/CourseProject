        <p>Unemployment fell to 3.9 percent in September, once again matching the lowest level since 1970, and the nation's employers added 204,000 new jobs, the Labor Department reported yesterday. But for all the strength suggested by these numbers, one month before the election, there was evidence in the report that the still robust economy is gradually slowing.</p>
        <p>President Clinton cited the jobs report as new evidence of the success of his economic policies. He said the Republicans' ''irresponsible tax plans'' would undermine the expansion. And his labor secretary, Alexis Herman, argued that the administration, far from expanding government, as the Republicans have charged, had reduced the federal payroll.</p>
        <p>The decrease in unemployment from 4.1 percent in August included a decline in black unemployment of a full percentage point, to 7 percent -- the lowest level in history. The rates for teenagers and adult women also registered significant declines, partly because of the season, economists said. Many teenagers returned to school, dropping out of the labor force, and mothers went back to work after having taken the summer off to be with their vacationing children.</p>
        <p>Both the job growth and the unemployment rate came in better than most economists had expected, and stronger than in August. But for many economists, the strength in September was more an anomaly than the beginning of a rebound after months of declining job creation.</p>
        <p>''We are in an economic slowdown,'' said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. ''Employers are clearly holding back on hiring, and adding hours much more slowly for those on their payrolls.''</p>
        <p>Job growth last month actually totaled 252,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. But that included the return to work of 75,000 striking workers, mostly from Verizon, and a decline of 27,000 in the ranks of temporary census workers. The net growth was 204,000 after adjusting for these factors.</p>
        <p>Still, that was much better than August, when 91,000 jobs disappeared, mainly because so many census workers left, and even in the private sector, job growth totaled only 17,000.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration made the most of the improvement. ''This is more good news for the American people,'' President Clinton said. And Ms. Herman, clearly addressing the Republicans, proclaimed that ''the era of big government is over and has been over.'' The federal payroll, she said, has shrunk by 320,000, to 2.6 million, since Mr. Clinton took office in 1993.</p>
        <p>The Republicans responded in kind. ''The single biggest cause for the decline in federal employment is cutbacks at the Pentagon,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican candidate for president. ''It gives a wrongful impression to the American people to suggest that the government is shrinking when it is the Defense Department that is shrinking.''</p>
        <p>He also attributed the low unemployment rate ''to the entrepreneurial activity of the private sector,'' not government action.</p>
        <p>For the year as a whole, job growth in both the public and private sector has averaged 192,000 a month, compared with 220,000 in the first nine months of last year. Private- sector employment has registered a similar decline. This year the unemployment rate has moved in a narrow range between 3.9 percent and 4.1 percent, having first fallen in April to 3.9 percent, the lowest level since January 1970.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve has argued that the nation is in danger of an inflationary spiral as employers bid for scarce workers by raising wages and then increase prices to pay the higher labor costs. After the Fed's policy makers met on Tuesday, they said that they were more likely to raise interest rates than lower them in the future because of the tight labor markets.</p>
        <p>But the wage pressure has not yet appeared. In September, the average hourly pay of production workers -- constituting roughly 80 percent of the 131.8 million people employed in September -- rose only 3 cents, to $13.83. Over the last year, the hourly wage has risen a mild 3.6 percent.</p>
        <p>Stock prices fell yesterday, as they often do when a strong jobs report suggests that the Fed might raise interest rates in the future. But economists attributed the decline much more to damage from higher energy prices and the expectations on Wall Street of weaker profit growth in the just-ended third quarter.</p>
        <p>''Anytime the economy shifts gears and begins to slow, there is anxiety and uncertainty,'' said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. ''You don't know how much the decline will be.''</p>
        <p>The September employment report fed the anxiety. While there was strong job creation in the service sector, manufacturers reduced their payrolls by 66,000 people, after cutting 117,000 jobs in August. Unable to raise prices, manufacturers, which typically are big users of energy, are offsetting higher oil and gas costs by trimming their work forces, said Gordon Richards, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. In addition, a strong dollar and weak euro have hurt exports, Mr. Gordon said. And companies have cut production and laid off workers while they reduce excessive inventories.</p>
        <p>In the service sector, temporary- help agencies led in job creation, adding 69,000 jobs in September. Payrolls also grew strongly in construction, health care, mortgage banking and job training. But the growth in some cases had more to do with abnormal seasonal variations that are likely to disappear next month, said Thomas L. Nardone, chief of the division at the Bureau of Labor Statistics that compiles the monthly employment reports.</p>
        <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts its monthly figures to allow for seasonal variations, but that process sometimes turns an actual decline in jobs into job growth. That was the case in September.</p>
        <p>Retailers, in contrast to the service sector, have failed to expand payrolls through most of the summer, a stagnation that some experts attribute to weaker consumer demand, partly because of the energy shock and partly because of rising interest rates.</p>
        <p>''They see that if they are going to have to spend more on gas and heating fuel, they are going to spend less on other things, even if they see the energy crisis as temporary,'' said Richard Curtin, chief of the University of Michigan's consumer surveys.</p>
