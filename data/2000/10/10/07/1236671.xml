        <p>Tuvia Grossman, 20, a Chicagoan who has been studying at a yeshiva in Jerusalem for two years, set out from school with two American friends on the High Holy Day of Rosh Hashana last week to pray at the Western Wall in the Old City.</p>
        <p>It became a shattering journey into the violence of the Middle East, relatives said this week.</p>
        <p>Like a vast majority of American Jews who go to Israel to study their religion, Mr. Grossman and his friends, Andrew Feibusch, 18, of Lawrence, N.Y., and Todd Pollock, 20, of Norfolk, Va., had never been caught up in the kind of fighting that has left scores dead in Israel and the Palestinian territories during the last week.</p>
        <p>But as the young Americans, all wearing yarmulkes, rode in an Arab's taxi through the Arab neighborhood of Wadi al Joz, just northeast of the old walled city, rocks rained against their car. They looked out, as they recalled later, and saw a crowd of Palestinian youths blocking the road and closing in on them.</p>
        <p>A stone crashed through the back window and Mr. Pollock's head was gashed. Then all of the taxi's windows were shattered in a volley of rocks, and the terrified Americans tried to huddle down and cover their faces. The doors were jerked open, they said, and they were dragged out by the mob and beaten.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollock and Mr. Feibusch somehow broke away and fled. But Mr. Grossman was hurled to the ground, stabbed twice in the right thigh and beaten by the crowd with fists, feet and stones.</p>
        <p>''I remember two strong hands holding my head and a rock coming down again and again on my head,'' Mr. Grossman told The Associated Press. ''I thought I was going to die.''</p>
        <p>Abruptly, he said, he remembered a story from history, about Jews blowing horns to scare away an attacking army. ''I let out a really loud yell, and for an instant they let go of me,'' he said. ''I took advantage of that and just ran.''</p>
        <p>Blood streaming down his head, contact lenses lost, pursued by some of the assailants, he ran about two blocks and saw, in a blur, the green uniform of an Israeli border policeman. The officer, wielding a club and moving toward him protectively, ordered the Palestinians to back off.</p>
        <p>''He recognized that Tuvia was Jewish and was being pursued, and he was yelling, 'Back off! Back off!' '' Mr. Grossman's aunt, Shelley Winkler, of Far Rockaway, Queens, said yesterday, having learned what happened from Mr. Grossman's parents, Dr. Aaron and Tzirel Grossman, who went to Israel early in the week.</p>
        <p>After forcing the rioters to retreat, the policeman wrapped a torn shirt around Mr. Grossman's head and stayed with him until an ambulance took him to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. Mr. Grossman, who suffered four gashes to the head, bruises and the stab wounds in the leg, was hospitalized last weekend and readmitted on Wednesday for blood transfusions. He and his parents are staying with relatives in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>A picture of Tuvia Grossman, his head bloodied and sitting in front of the approaching police officer, was taken by an Israeli photographer for Zoom 77, an Israeli agency, and sent that Friday, Sept. 29, to The A.P. in Jerusalem with a garbled Hebrew caption that misidentified Mr. Grossman as an Israeli ambulance medic.</p>
        <p>The A.P., which had received many pictures of injured Palestinians that day, did not clarify the garbled caption but sent the picture to subscribers with a caption based on the erroneous assumption that Mr. Grossman was a Palestinian. It also misidentified the site, first as the Temple Mount and later as another site in the Old City.</p>
        <p>Many newspapers published the picture and erroneous captions based on The A.P.'s information. The New York Times misidentified Mr. Grossman in last Saturday's issue as a Palestinian and in some copies misidentified the site as the Temple Mount. In a correction on Wednesday, The Times noted that the wounded man was Tuvia Grossman, a student from Chicago, but -- using erroneous information from The A.P. -- mistakenly said the site of the attack was in the Old City.</p>
