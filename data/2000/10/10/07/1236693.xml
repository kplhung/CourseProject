        <p>Finance Director Plans To Quit British Telecom  Facing criticism as its debt balloons and shareholder demands for a management shake-up, British Telecommunications said its finance director, Robert Brace, was leaving.</p>
        <p>But a British Telecommunications spokeswoman said Mr. Brace's decision to step down after 11 years had been planned for some time and was unrelated to the company's current financial situation. She also denied recent press reports that the company's chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, would be resigning. [Page C2.]</p>
        <p>Tougher Auto Safety Bills Rebuffed  Rebuffing an attempt to stiffen auto safety laws, Congress today passed a $58 billion transportation spending bill. The House approved the transportation bill by a vote of 344 to 50, while the Senate adopted it by a margin of 78 to 10. The bill's most notable feature is the setting of a stringent national standard for what constitutes drunk driving. But overshadowing the margin of approval were the unsuccessful attempts by Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, to bring tougher auto safety laws to the Senate floor. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Fox Settles Suit With TheStreet.com  The Fox News Network has settled a lawsuit against TheStreet.com and its co-founder, James J. Cramer, after the financial news site canceled a program on the Fox News Channel, a cable channel. TheStreet.com agreed not to produce a similar show for another network before May 1, 2001. Mr. Cramer promised to make only occasional appearances on other networks until then. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Report Questions Federal Surpluses  A Congressional Budget Office study on federal budget surpluses warned that although the fiscal outlook for the next decade or so is bright, and getting brighter, the picture over the longer run remains troubled. In setting their agendas, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are counting on nearly $4.6 trillion in projected surpluses. [A11.]</p>
        <p>SmithKline May Bid for Block Drug  SmithKline Beecham, which is being acquired by Glaxo Wellcome, is a front-runner in the bidding for the closely held Block Drug of Jersey City, the maker of Sensodyne toothpaste and Polident denture cleaners, a person close to SmithKline said. [C2.]</p>
        <p>California Power Market Criticized  California's electricity market is not competitive and needs to be fixed, the California Power Exchange said in a draft report. It recommended easing restrictions on building power plants and penalizing companies for waiting until the last minute to deliver power. [C4.]</p>
        <p>25% Rise in Heating Prices Forecast  As the price of crude oil climbed, a federal agency said that consumers should brace for an increase of at least 25 percent in the prices of heating oil and natural gas this winter, with an even bigger increase if temperatures are colder than usual. Compared with last winter, consumers will be paying 29 percent more for natural gas and 16 percent more for heating oil, the Energy Information Administration predicted. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Thailand to Sell Power Plant Stake  Thailand's national utility plans to sell to the public this month 40 percent of a power plant that is the exclusive customer of a natural gas project in Myanmar. The project has been criticized by human rights activists, who say that it helps finance an oppressive junta in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Columbus Day Closings  Though stock markets are open Monday, the Treasury bond market, commodity trading in some financial contracts, government offices and many banks are closed in observance of Columbus Day. They will reopen on Tuesday.</p>
