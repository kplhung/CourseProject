        <p>Television station WCBS, which is the host of tomorrow's debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, has asked radio networks that want to broadcast the event to help defray the costs of the production.</p>
        <p>Several of the news organizations initially balked, but all were eventually able to work out agreements with WCBS by the end of the week.</p>
        <p>But the furor over the fees of up to $4,000 per news organization provides another glimpse into how things are not following the normal rules in this campaign.</p>
        <p>WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York, is holding the debate at its Broadcast Center on West 57th Street, and several other news organizations plan to broadcast the event.</p>
        <p>The arguments began early this week when National Public Radio's two local stations, WFUV-FM (90.7) and WNYC-AM (820), refused to pay the $4,000 sought by WCBS officials to help reduce the costs of the event. One NPR radio host, Brian Lehrer, complained about the fee on the air.</p>
        <p>Without discussing specifics of WCBS's expenses, Dana McClintock, a spokesman for CBS News, said that ''this is an initiative that will make no profit, nor do we intend it to,'' and said that ''we think it is fair that the other parties who will benefit from and share in our coverage be asked to help defray some of these costs.''</p>
        <p>Generally for an hour-long debate, the cost of an audio feed runs a couple hundred dollars, for an engineer's time and an I.S.D.N. line.</p>
        <p>Bloomberg Radio, which is carrying the debate along with CBS radio affiliates throughout the state, agreed to pay. CBS Television affiliates in New York, as well as CNN, will also broadcast the 10:30 a.m. event.</p>
        <p>Several officials familiar with WCBS's efforts said that the costs were much greater because of the high profile of the debate. For example, WCBS had to build a room, complete with telephone lines for voice and computer, for the more than 100 members of the news media attending the event.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, NPR officials were able to work out an agreement with WCBS that would allow WFUV-FM to carry the debate at no charge. WNYC-AM, the other NPR station, will not broadcast the debate.</p>
        <p>''We figured, after listening to them, that because they were a nonprofit the rules should be different,'' one debate organizer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>
