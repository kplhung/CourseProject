        <p>Darryl Hamilton, the Mets outfielder and a former Giant, was discouraged by the razzing he got from the fans at Pacific Bell Park in the first two games of the Mets-Giants division series.</p>
        <p>Hamilton is a veteran and should probably know better. This is the playoffs and, as he learned Thursday night, old friends are October enemies.</p>
        <p>''They were ragging him a lot, and he was hurt -- he always respected Giants fans,'' said the Mets utility player Lenny Harris. ''But I told him: 'Hey, you're on another team. You have to accept that right now, they're going to come after you hard. But you've got to stay focused no matter where you go.' ''</p>
        <p>Focus was not a problem for Hamilton, who stroked a two-out double in the 10th inning of Game 2 -- ''it feels very good,'' he said yesterday at Shea Stadium -- and scored the go-ahead run on a single by Jay Payton. Nor was it a problem for John Franco, the reliever who struck out Barry Bonds to finish a 5-4 victory while 40,430 dismayed fans shrieked.</p>
        <p>The Giants lost for only the 20th time in their last 75 games at Pac Bell, and the three-of-five-game series is tied, 1-1, with the next two games at Shea Stadium, where the Mets went 55-25 this season .</p>
        <p>''We're going to have a home-field advantage now for two games,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''And I think our fans are going to try to outdo their fans. That should be a real exciting challenge for them.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' Game 3 starter, Rick Reed, was in the bullpen for the last home game of last October's playoffs, the thrilling 15-inning victory over Atlanta in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series. The ballpark was shaking, Reed said, and he mentioned this to a teammate the other day.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad I was on the New York side,'' Reed said, ''because I tell you what, that was scary.''</p>
        <p>But if the Giants face an intimidating environment, they have the right pitcher starting Game 3. Russ Ortiz is 4-0 in his career against the Mets, beating them at Shea for his first career victory in 1998 and winning there again last August with seven one-hit, shutout innings. Ortiz is prone to wildness, but Flushing brings out his best.</p>
        <p>''I like being in New York,'' Ortiz said. ''I like visiting there. It's the kind of city that likes baseball, and they get excited for it. I enjoy that, and it just makes it a lot more fun for me.''</p>
        <p>For all the talk about home-field advantage in this series, the players largely discount its impact.</p>
        <p>Al Leiter, who was masterly for eight innings in Game 2, said the fans at Shea will do their best to rattle the Giants. But Leiter doubts if that will make any difference. ''Look, you're not here in the playoffs if you're not able to handle that kind of distraction and adversity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Timo Perez handled everything flawlessly in San Francisco. The rookie right-fielder had three singles, all with two outs. The first drove in two runs. The second was a bunt single on a 3-2 count. The third was a single in the ninth inning that gave Edgardo Alfonzo the chance to bash a two-run homer that proved to be pivotal.</p>
        <p>The Giants had only a month of regular-season scouting reports on Perez, and they were not enough.</p>
        <p>''He is the guy we knew least about,'' Giants Manager Dusty Baker said. ''We'd never seen him before; seen him on TV a couple of times. He had limited at-bats. These are the guys that usually kind of hurt you until you learn who they are.''</p>
        <p>Perez, 23, made his major league debut on Sept. 1 at St. Louis. He felt pressure, he said through a translator Thursday night, but he watched Alfonzo, talked to him and took note of his relaxed approach.</p>
        <p>That helped, he said, but it still must be hard for Perez to believe he is here. The former Japanese leaguer has exceeded his expectations after starting the season at Class A.</p>
        <p>''I never thought I was going to be here that quick,'' he said. ''But thank God I got the chance to come here. I'm doing my job and I'm happy and proud to be doing well.''</p>
        <p>Valentine put Perez in the lineup after losing Derek Bell to a sprained right ankle that will keep him out for the rest of the postseason. Alfonzo moved into Bell's No. 2 spot in the lineup, and he is enjoying hitting behind Perez.</p>
        <p>''He's a guy you want to have in front of you,'' Alfonzo said. ''You want to have him on base, because he puts pressure on the other team.''</p>
        <p>Perez stood to be the hero of Game 2 -- along with Leiter -- before J. T. Snow's one-out, three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth tied the game off Armando Benitez. The Mets' closer was gracious after the game, offering no excuses.</p>
        <p>Franco earned what he called the biggest save of his 15-year career, but was modest in the clubhouse. ''He's been doing it all year long,'' Franco said of Benitez. ''On Saturday, if we have a one-run lead or a two-run lead, I'm sure Bobby's going to put him out there. He's this team's closer.''</p>
        <p>Benitez's failure was no more surprising than that of Felix Rodriguez, the Giants' setup man who had a 1.73 earned run average after July 4. Rodriguez gave up Alfonzo's homer in the ninth and the decisive Mets run in the 10th, reinforcing the point that even the hottest pitchers can be mortal at this time of year.</p>
        <p>''Two great teams going at it,'' Franco said. ''It's going to be a tough series.''</p>
        <p>After two games, it already is.</p>
