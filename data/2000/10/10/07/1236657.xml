        <p>Just 36 hours after the first presidential debate came those unforgettable scenes in Belgrade as the Serbs reclaimed their destiny. They underlined what may be the most important question in our election: Could George W. Bush as president deal wisely with the crises of the world?</p>
        <p>In the debate, Governor Bush laid down a number of specific guidelines on what his foreign policy would be. They portrayed a much more limited American role in the world. If they had been in effect in recent years, I do not believe those scenes in Belgrade would have taken place.</p>
        <p>Jim Lehrer asked Mr. Bush how he would go about deciding when it was in the national interest to use U.S. force abroad. He replied that it must be ''in our vital national interests,'' and he went on to define the phrase.</p>
        <p>''That means,'' he said, when ''our territory is threatened or [our] people could be harmed,'' when ''our defense alliances are threatened'' or ''our friends in the Middle East are threatened.''</p>
        <p>That careful definition pointedly excluded what has been the most notable mission of U.S. troops abroad in recent years: to prevent continuing genocide by Slobodan Milosevic's forces in Bosnia and Kosovo -- places that have not been considered within America's ''vital national interests.'' Earlier this year Governor Bush said explicitly that ''we should not send our troops to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide in nations outside our strategic interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush went on in the debate to indicate that our soldiers should be withdrawn from some places where they are now stationed. And he denounced what he called ''nation-building'' as a mission.</p>
        <p>''I believe we're overextended in too many places . . . ,'' he said. ''If we don't stop extending our troops all around the world, and nation-building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem.'' In his closing statement he added: ''I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times.''</p>
        <p>From what places would Mr. Bush now withdraw U.S. forces? Someone really should ask him. Japan? Korea? The NATO countries? The Persian Gulf? Kosovo, where he in fact supported President Clinton's intervention? Bosnia?</p>
        <p>Bosnia is his likeliest target. It is the only place that seems remotely to fit his sneering attack on ''nation-building.'' But the fewer than 5,000 American soldiers there are not doing that. Along with other international contingents, they are keeping the peace. They have suffered no casualties from hostile fire. And in interviews, American soldiers have said how proud they are to be taking part in the mission.</p>
        <p>In fact, Bosnia is the example that shows how tragically mistaken the Bush policy would be. Mr. Milosevic sent his thugs into Bosnia in 1992 as part of his strategy to distract Serbs' attention by playing on nationalism -- a strategy that also took him into Croatia and Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The Milosevic onslaught in Bosnia stopped only when President Clinton finally intervened by calling the Dayton conference in 1995. The accords reached there were possible because the United States agreed to join in enforcing them. Without that commitment -- to send troops outside our traditional areas of strategic interest -- the conflict would have continued.</p>
        <p>Dayton slowly reduced Mr. Milosevic's opportunities for nationalist mischief. Reason was given a chance: in Bosnia, then in Croatia (thanks in part to the timely death of the hyper-nationalist Franjo Tudjman), and finally in Serbia when he was thwarted in Kosovo. Mr. Milosevic ran out of distractions, and the Serbian people took over.</p>
        <p>If the United States had not intervened in Bosnia and later in Kosovo, I think all of Southeastern Europe might now be in conflict -- Macedonia, Greece and Albania as well as the former Yugoslavia. And Slobodan Milosevic would still hold power in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>Why should Governor Bush ignore those realities and lay down constricting principles for the American role in the world? There may be an element of loyalty to his father, who as president did nothing to stop Mr. Milosevic when he began his rampage; but I cannot believe that is the major reason. More likely it is an attempt to appeal to one particular slice of conservative opinion: a contemporary version of isolationism.</p>
        <p>But perhaps George W. Bush really believes that an American president should turn his eyes away from genocide in Europe. That is an alarming possibility, in a world dependent on American leadership.</p>
