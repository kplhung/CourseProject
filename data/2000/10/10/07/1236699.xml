        <p>After a week of rioting and gun battles, Israeli and Palestinian authorities today struggled mutually, with limited success, to keep the Friday Prayers at Al Aksa Mosque in the Old City from ending in a bloodbath and further inflaming an already explosive Israeli-Arab conflict.</p>

        <p>After a week of rioting and gun battles, Israeli and Palestinian authorities today struggled mutually, with limited success, to keep the Friday Prayers at Al Aksa Mosque in the Old City from ending in a bloodbath and further inflaming an already explosive Israeli-Arab conflict.</p>
        <p>Unlike last week, when Israeli police stormed the mosque compound, killing 5 and wounding 200 Palestinians, Israeli officers kept to the perimeter after Prayers. Inside, Palestinian security officials with megaphones urged restraint, while frail Muslim clerics wrestled chunks of concrete from young men trying to throw them over the wall onto the plaza facing the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site.</p>
        <p>After some Palestinian youths succeeded in hurling rocks onto the plaza, which was sparsely attended by worshipers because of fears of violence, the Israeli police began shooting into the compound, which is known by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount. The Palestinian security officials said they had not tried to prevent the youths from stoning the Israeli police, whom they considered fair game.</p>
        <p>Despite their efforts, a short-lived calm disintegrated into chaotic clashes, joining with violent exchanges in the West Bank and in Gaza to add at least eight more Palestinian deaths to the mounting toll.</p>
        <p>[Early Saturday, in another indication that the Israelis are seeking to pull back from the confrontation, Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered what he said was a temporary evacuation of soldiers from Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish holy site in the West Bank town of Nablus that has been the scene of fierce clashes over the past week, Reuters reported. The Israeli Army said responsibility for guarding the site had been handed over to the Palestinian authorities. It said the move was the result of both sides' desire to reduce tension.]</p>
        <p>One Palestinian teenager, shot inside Al Aksa, died from what Palestinian doctors said was a bullet to the head. About 60 Palestinians were treated for injuries, including a 12-year-old boy lingering near death late tonight. Some 24 Israeli officers were hurt, almost all lightly.</p>
        <p>Still, afterward, Israelis and Palestinians both proclaimed their parallel security efforts a relative achievement. Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian official in Jerusalem, said that a ''massacre'' was averted. And Yair Yitzhaki, the Jerusalem police chief, said, ''The easiest thing for the head of the police to do is give an order to enter the Temple Mount, which, in my view, would have caused dozens of deaths today.''</p>
        <p>There could also be diplomatic repercussions if peace talks ever resume, since sovereignty over the holy site is the most explosive issue.</p>
        <p>''Despite the one martyr's death, it is clear that things go more smoothly when Haram al Sharif is in our hands,'' a senior Palestinian official said, using the Arabic term for Noble Sanctuary.</p>
        <p>The new deaths raised the toll to at least 77 after eight days of violence, surpassing the 75 killed in a period of intense violence that followed the Israelis' opening of a tunnel alongside the Western Wall in 1996.</p>
        <p>The present conflict, which has raged long enough to signal a turning point in the seven-year-old Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking relationship, began in the heart of the Old City late last week. Palestinians are calling it the Al Aksa uprising.</p>
        <p>A week ago Thursday, Ariel Sharon, the right-wing opposition leader, made a politically charged visit to the holy site. Israelis claim sovereignty over the entire massive stone structure, but Islamic authorities control the ancient mosques and plaza on top.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians and some Israelis say that Mr. Sharon deliberately challenged the peace effort -- and Prime Minister Ehud Barak, his political opponent -- by striding into the Muslim-controlled area, trailing cameras and hundreds of Israeli officers. But, given the intensity and duration of the eruption that followed, Israeli officials contend that the Palestinians used Mr. Sharon's visit as a pretext for an uprising.</p>
        <p>The extent of the Palestinian rage and the force of the Israeli suppression have shocked many. Many young Palestinians are talking about it as a war of independence.</p>
        <p>Some centrist Israelis, on the other hand, have been taken aback retrospectively by their own faith in the idea that after two quiet years, violent conflict with the Palestinians was behind them.</p>
        <p>Nationalist Israelis are already using the violence to revive their faltering movement, with I-told-you-so claims about what they see to have been the naivete of the doves. On the front page of the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth today, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that Israel must ''aggressively repulse the Arab violence.''</p>
        <p>''For the first time in many years, the very existence of the country is in  danger,'' Mr. Netanyahu said.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Israeli attorney general decided not to prosecute Mr. Netanyahu on charges of corruption, clearing the way for him to again seek the leadership of the opposition, now held by Mr. Sharon.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials said they were stunned when the Israeli police began moving out of the mosque plaza and away from its gates early this morning. They were also suspicious, they said, that the Israelis wanted to provoke them into losing control.</p>
        <p>''They left, so we entered,'' Mr. Husseini said, referring to the Palestinian security officials. ''Our security is present there all the time, but we increased it, because we smelled something. Our aim was to keep the worshipers calm, and make sure that no one attacked the Wall below, to make it clear that we will protect their religious sites, too.''</p>
        <p>As Muslims began filing over the worn cobblestones of the Old City's alleys and into the mosque compound, the word traveled that the holy site had been ''liberated.'' The prayers began around noon, broadcast over loudspeakers.</p>
        <p>Beneath them, at the Western Wall, several Israelis were outraged that their police had withdrawn from above to be replaced by Palestinians. ''What is the Palestinian Authority doing on the Temple Mount?'' said Dan Meridor, a legislator from the Center Party who visited the Wall. ''It is not theirs. We cannot get into a situation where we're dependent on the Palestinian Authority regarding Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Thousands began pouring out of the mosques after a prayer of mourning was recited for those killed this week. Over the loudspeakers, a cleric said: ''You are the owners of the mosque, the protectors. The occupation soldiers have stepped away from the gates. We should not goad them into coming back.''</p>
        <p>As the young men were milling around, prayer rugs slung over their shoulders, security officers asked them to keep calm and not provoke the Israelis by throwing stones.</p>
        <p>On a dime, the situation changed. One man shouted, ''God is great,'' and then many ran to throw stones down at the Western Wall. Wheelbarrows of stones were rolled up to the mosque's roof. A religious official ran after the youths with a stick.</p>
        <p>Below, the police directed Jewish worshipers into the tunnel alongside the wall. Later, Zeev Semat, an elderly man who said he was a ninth-generation Jerusalemite, emerged and pointed to the litter of rocks. ''It hurts my heart to think we have to run away from the Wall because of them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian officials begged the youths to stop throwing stones down at a prayer area. Eventually, the youths redirected themselves at the Israeli police standing outside the compound at one of the entrances, the Lion's Gate.</p>
        <p>The Israelis were observed shooting tear gas, stun grenades, and projectiles into the compound and then outside of it as the conflict spilled onto the Via Dolorosa and beyond. Eventually, the Israelis let ambulances through to remove the wounded and stepped back themselves. The men inside stood on the walls and thrust their hands into the air in signs of victory. ''Who cares what Arafat wants?'' one masked teenager said. ''This is not Arafat's home. It is the house of God.''</p>
        <p>Late in the afternoon, the Israelis entered the compound and arrested close to a dozen of the young men.  The young men had hoisted a Palestinian flag and a Hamas flag, representing the Islamic fundamentalist group, atop the mount. The soldiers quickly took them down.</p>
