        <p>The day before his debate with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in Danville, Ky., Dick Cheney said he hoped to set a ''pleasant and professional tone'' there. Nonetheless, he and his coaches made sure he went to the table armed with attack lines, just in case.</p>
        <p>But when it became clear on Thursday night that Mr. Lieberman would not go after him personally, and that the moderator, Bernard Shaw of CNN, would give him ample opportunity to outline his policy differences with the Democrats, Mr. Cheney decided to try something novel: sticking to the issues and answering the questions.</p>
        <p>''It was funny, Joe and I were joking last night after the debate that both of us had more aggressive options that we had trained for but we didn't use,'' Mr. Cheney told reporters yesterday, ''and concluded that we had probably wasted about half of our prep time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's and Mr. Lieberman's restraint resulted in something that many politicians, analysts and ordinary viewers said was a rarity in contemporary presidential politics: a thoughtful, informative debate free of rancor and with minimal posturing. While some viewers confessed to being slightly bored, others said they were left feeling braced.</p>
        <p>Carmen Obando, an office cleaning worker in Orlando, Fla., said she had enjoyed the debate so much that it had created a dilemma for her.</p>
        <p>''I liked Cheney,'' Mrs. Obando said. ''But I really liked Lieberman, too. I didn't really like the other two. They were all snippy and they kept saying the same things over and over.''</p>
        <p>The ''other two'' are Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, their parties' presidential nominees, who clashed in the campaign's first debate in Boston on Tuesday night, and Mrs. Obando was hardly alone in thinking that the leading men had been outclassed by their running mates.</p>
        <p>''I think most of the people watching were probably wondering why those two guys weren't first on the ticket,'' said Chris Perrey, a graduate student in Edina, Minn.</p>
        <p>To many viewers, the easy cordiality of Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary, and Mr. Lieberman, the Connecticut senator, reflected poorly on the combative tone of the first presidential debate, particularly on Mr. Gore's exaggerated diction and aggressive bids to have the last word. Some found that Mr. Cheney's authoritative answers, particularly on foreign policy and national security, underscored the thinness of Mr. Bush's responses in those areas.</p>
        <p>''Last night was easily the better debate,'' said Stephen Wayne, a political science professor at Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>The debate, which Nielsen Media Research said was seen by 28.5 million people, did not appear to have changed many minds. Nor do strategists inside or outside the campaigns think that Thursday's exchange will influence the two remaining presidential debates. But for some people, it left a wistfulness.</p>
        <p>After watching Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Cheney, ''I wish they were running for president more than Al Gore and George Bush,'' said Kathryn White, 36, a Web designer in Athens, Ga. ''They were seasoned pros above all the mudslinging.''</p>
        <p>It need not have been so. In keeping with the traditional role of the No. 2 candidate, the vice-presidential nominees have made many of their campaigns' strongest attacks -- and Mr. Cheney resumed doing so yesterday. Mr. Cheney, in particular, has been on the offensive for a month, questioning the Democrats' policies and Mr. Gore's character.</p>
        <p>Strategists on each side said they were ready for -- even half-expected -- a debate nearly as rough as the one between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, who will face each other twice more. The decision to hold to a more courtly tone, they said, was made on the fly, by the candidates themselves.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Cheney said the decision to keep the debate cordial and issue-oriented was the way Mr. Cheney wanted to turn the discussion. The Bush campaign was also pleased with the result, which Cheney aides said they viewed as beneficial in the long run because they expected that it played well with independents and swing voters who were tired of finger-pointing and name-calling.</p>
        <p>''He had a number of salvos ready if he needed them,'' an aide said, explaining that Mr. Cheney had been prepared to question Mr. Gore's character and credibility, and positions Mr. Lieberman had changed after joining the ticket.</p>
        <p>In mock debates last week, Mr. Cheney had been forced to defend his voting record in Congress. But aides said that the surrogates they used to portray Mr. Lieberman were harsher than the real Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney said he had felt obligated to prepare for the worst during his practice debates.</p>
        <p>''I think that potential was always there from the standpoint of preparation,'' he said. ''You could never assume that it wouldn't go that way.''</p>
        <p>It is not as if Mr. Cheney is shy about going on the attack. For several weeks, he has aimed an average of at least one barb a day at Mr. Gore, accusing him of ''making things up out of whole cloth,'' of  ''embellishing,'' of proposing a ''Swiss cheese budget.'' Even as he was being lauded for his gentlemanly conduct yesterday, he issued some of his sharpest criticisms yet.</p>
        <p>Aides said Mr. Cheney preferred to use his time in the debate laying out the Bush campaign's proposals on taxes, Social Security and education. His one attack on Mr. Lieberman, in response to a pointed question from Mr. Shaw, was almost apologetic, prefaced with a disclaimer: ''Boy, we've been trying very hard to keep this on a high plain, Bernie.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney seemed relieved and pleased with the result, saying: ''I think both of us preferred to do it the way we did it last night. I think Bernie Shaw had a big impact in terms of the tone and the level he set, and I felt good about it, and I'm sure Joe Lieberman did too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney provided perhaps the most surprising moment of the debate when Mr. Shaw gave him an opening to tear into his opponent for criticizing the violence and vulgarity of popular culture, while raising money from the entertainment industry -- a balancing act that Mr. Cheney and other Republicans have labeled hypocrisy. Mr. Cheney said nothing harsher to the senator than, ''My concern would be, frankly, that you haven't been as consistent as you had been in the past'' on the issue.</p>
        <p>There were, of course, disagreements, even barbs, but they were mostly polite as could be.</p>
        <p>William M. Daley, chairman of the Gore campaign, said the Republicans decided not to go on the offensive after seeing polls showing that most people believed Mr. Gore won the debate in Boston.</p>
        <p>''Going on the attack wasn't working for them,'' Mr. Daley said.</p>
        <p>Republicans countered that staying low-key merely played to Mr. Cheney's strengths.</p>
        <p>Professor Wayne said the vice-presidential debate put the shortcomings of the presidential candidates into bold relief -- a view that officials in both camps endorsed.</p>
        <p>''Gore seems to talk down to people, and to hammer a point home so many times that it's a little obnoxious,'' Mr. Wayne said. ''And a lot of Bush's answers were light. He was good at name-calling about Gore's numbers, but he didn't really rebut them or get beyond general themes.''</p>
        <p>Even many of the politicians and party officials rounded up by each side to put a spin on the outcome Thursday night conceded that it was an improvement over Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''In some ways it was a better debate,'' said Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee. ''But it's apples and oranges. They were sitting at a table, not standing at lecterns. And I think you'd expect the guys at the top of the ticket to be a little more heated, a little more confrontational, more intense.''</p>
