        <p>Why are men so much more concerned about their bodies today than they were 50 years ago?</p>
        <p>This was the question Harrison G. Pope Jr., a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and two colleagues asked themselves after noticing a sharp increase in male gym memberships, anabolic steroid use and especially body image disorders, including muscle dysmorphia (sometimes called bigorexia), an illness characterized by compulsive exercising and the sufferer's irrational conviction that he is weak and puny even though he may be bulging with muscle.</p>
        <p>To explain this trend, Mr. Pope and his colleagues came up with a provocative hypothesis: threatened masculinity. As women have entered the work force and become heads of families, men have had to relinquish their traditional roles as fathers, soldiers and breadwinners, the authors speculated, which leaves their bodies as the only way to demonstrate their masculinity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pope and his colleagues, who published their findings this spring in ''The Adonis Complex: The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession'' (Free Press), are not the only ones convinced that masculinity is under siege. Over the last two years social scientists, philosophers and cultural commentators of both sexes and all political persuasions have begun sounding the alarm in an outpouring of articles and books, several with pulse-raising titles like ''The Decline of Males,'' ''Stiffed: The Betrayal of American Men'' and ''On Men: Masculinity in Crisis.''</p>
        <p>Some experts are focusing on the transformation of America's ''masculine'' manufacturing economy into a ''feminine'' service and retail economy to explain what they say is a large rise in male status anxiety and asocial behavior, symbolized by the teenage boys who killed 13 people and themselves at Columbine High School last year. Others theorize that the sweeping social changes wrought by the women's movement, the birth control pill and legal abortion have stripped men of their traditional roles as providers and protectors, leaving them feeling physically powerless and psychologically bereft.</p>
        <p>Depending on which expert is consulted, young boys are victims either of an unreasonable code of masculinity that doesn't allow them to express their feelings, or of a misguided feminist educational system bent on making them more like little girls. There is little consensus about whether masculinity is a product of culture (and therefore susceptible to change) or biology (and therefore unchanging). In some ways the debate is the latest chapter in the nation's culture wars, with liberals and conservatives arguing over the plight of a particular group, in this case men.</p>
        <p>Conservatives writing about male decline often single out feminism as the culprit. ''Greater opportunity for women is probably the most significant gain for human freedom in the last century,'' the culture critic Andrew Sullivan wrote in The New Republic in June. ''But with this gain has come a somewhat unexpected problem: How do we restore a sense of masculinity that is vaguely civilized? Take their exclusive vocations away, remove their institutions, de-gender their clubs and schools and workplaces, and you leave men with more than a little cultural bewilderment.''</p>
        <p>''By denying any deep biological or psychological difference between the sexes,'' he continued, ''some influential feminists refuse to countenance any special treatment for men and boys.'' Mr. Sullivan's views are echoed by Harvey C. Mansfield, a political philosopher at Harvard who teaches a graduate seminar on manliness and is writing a book on the subject.</p>
        <p>''We've gone from this tremendous assertion of masculinity at the beginning of the century to this ideal of the sensitive male and a gender-neutral society at the end,'' Mr. Mansfield said. ''If you agree with the biologists that manliness is something permanent and unchangeable, in a gender-neutral society you'll run into problems.</p>
        <p>''One is the desire of men to protect those who are weaker than they are: women and, especially, children. Since women are in the work force, they no longer depend on men for support the way they used to, which can make men feel they are not useful and lead them into irresponsibility, violence and criminality.''</p>
        <p>Conservatives often cite the work of Lionel Tiger, an anthropologist at Rutgers University whose 1999 book ''The Decline of Males'' (St. Martin's Griffin) blames the birth control pill for a decrease in men's social status. Before oral contraceptives achieved widespread use in the 1960's, Mr. Tiger writes, pregnancy was regarded by men and women as a shared responsibility. At the turn of the 20th century, he reports, as many as half of American brides were pregnant when they married. After women went on the pill, the average age at marriage and the number of single mothers increased.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tiger says that public policy has encouraged women's independence from men by extending welfare benefits to single mothers, awarding mothers custody of children in divorce cases and even denying fathers visiting rights. Men, he concludes, have become socially expendable: no longer essential for raising or supporting a family.</p>
        <p>''The pill represents the first time in history that one sex has been given complete control over reproduction,'' Mr. Tiger said in an interview. ''The decline of men has everything to do with them being alienated from the means of reproduction.''</p>
        <p>Such arguments do not sit well with feminists, even those sympathetic to the idea of a men's crisis. ''The women's movement is just a symptom of basic changes in the economy that are favoring women,'' said Helen Fisher, a colleague of Mr. Tiger's in the Rutgers anthropology department and the author of ''The First Sex: The Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World'' (Random House, 1999).</p>
        <p>In her book Ms. Fisher cites recent findings in biology and genetics to argue that the female brain is optimally suited for the demands of a high-tech, media- and communications-oriented economy. Though she predicts an increase in female economic power in the coming century, Ms. Fisher does not say it will come at the expense of men, who, she points out, still control the overwhelming majority of top positions in American corporations and politics.</p>
        <p>Susan Faludi, a feminist critic and the author of ''Stiffed: The Betrayal of American Men'' (William Morrow), a much-discussed 1999 book, agrees. ''There's a lot of blaming and confusion over women's meager gains and the so-called feminization of culture,'' she said. ''It may appear to men on the down escalator that women have the upper hand, but even in our service economy, which is coded as feminine, women are still relegated to jobs that don't pay a decent wage.''</p>
        <p>The real problem men face today, Ms. Faludi argues, has less to do with feminism than with surviving in a consumer retail culture that values body image and sex appeal, the components of stereotypical femininity that the women's movement was rejecting. ''The pressures men feel today are the very pressures that had women by the throat,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Whether feminism, the economy or other factors are responsible, there is evidence that American culture is paying more attention to the male body. When Mr. Pope and his colleagues, Katharine A. Phillips and Robert Olivardia, examined advertisements featuring male and female bodies that had appeared in the women's magazines Glamour and Cosmopolitan since 1950, they found the percentage of ads depicting women in some state of undress remained relatively stable, hovering around 20 percent. By contrast the percentage of ads depicting undressed men rose sharply, from less than 5 percent in 1950 to as much as 35 percent in the 90's.</p>
        <p>''The fact that the percentage of undressed females did not change tremendously over the years suggests that this is not due to some general trend toward nudity or to some editorial change,'' Mr. Pope concluded.</p>
        <p>But other scholars wonder whether the alarms being raised are really all that new. ''There is always a crisis,'' said Gail Bederman, a historian at the University of Notre Dame and the author of ''Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880-1917'' (University of Chicago Press, 1995). ''The idea of what men are and what women are is always changing. When people are looking at it, there's always a crisis.''</p>
        <p>She pointed out that at the turn of the 20th century the United States was also grappling with a masculinity crisis. President Theodore Roosevelt routinely invoked a national decline in manliness to justify aggressive westward expansion and foreign imperialism.</p>
        <p>''This was a time when immigrants were flooding into the country, the birth rate of native-born Americans was declining, and there was much labor unrest,'' Ms. Bederman said. ''Roosevelt was part of a group of middle- and upper-class men concerned about the direction the nation was going, and he understood the problems in terms of a threatened masculinity.''</p>
