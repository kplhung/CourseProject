        <p>President Clinton hailed the victory of Vojislav Kostunica today, stressing that it was a triumph for the people of Yugoslavia and promising to work with Europe to lift economic sanctions.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Mr. Clinton called Mr. Kostunica the ''newly elected'' president and praised him for the ''integrity and leadership'' that brought about a new era in Yugoslavia after more than a decade of violence under President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, speaking in the White House Rose Garden, said he considered Mr. Kostunica the president because ''the people have taken care of the transfer of power.''</p>
        <p>But he added that he hoped the Parliament would formally ratify Mr. Kostunica as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>Putting a historic sweep on Mr. Milosevic's demise, Mr. Clinton compared it to the major anti-Communist movements that undid the Soviet empire.</p>
        <p>''This is just as big a blow for freedom as we saw when the Berlin Wall was torn down, when Lech Walesa led the shipyard workers in Poland,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who has made the removal of Mr. Milosevic a major goal, saluted the people for their courage and persistence.</p>
        <p>''I basically ascribe nine-tenths of the credit to the Yugoslav people,'' she said at the State Department. They are the ones that have lived during this very unfortunate time and had the guts to go out and get out on the streets and voice their views and pull themselves together in the opposition.''</p>
        <p>Of her own role and that of the European allies, she added, ''We have sat in many conference rooms and many airplanes and had many trans-Atlantic phone calls, but we're not the ones out on the street.''</p>
        <p>As the administration monitored events in Yugoslavia and watched a little uneasily as the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, met with Mr. Milosevic, officials said they could not countenance any future political or public role for Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Milosevic made his televised statement today acknowledging Mr. Kostunica's elections and adding that after a rest from public life, he would come back as an opposition politician, a senior administration official said that this was ''not enough'' of a retreat by Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>But the official added that the magnitude of the popular revolt on the streets showed that the Serbian people did not want Mr. Milosevic to have a public role, either, and that therefore the administration did not see him as a threat to the new order.</p>
        <p>By late today, the administration got what it had been looking for as an important verification of Mr. Kostunica's victory: the Yugoslav Army chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic congratulated the president-elect in a statement televised on the federal government's controlled station.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said of Mr. Milosevic, ''I think we are seeing a very rapid deterioration of his position.''</p>
        <p>In briefings for reporters, administration officials said they would like to see Mr. Milosevic, who was indicted last year by the international war crimes tribunal for his actions in Kosovo, stand trial.</p>
        <p>But they did not indicate how this might happen and officials said privately that they believed Mr. Milosevic would remain in Serbia, the dominant of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia. (The other is Montenegro.)</p>
        <p>This was largely because he was too hot a property for any country, including Russia, to grant asylum, they said.</p>
        <p>There appeared to be some confusion, and nervousness, about what exactly Mr. Ivanov was up to in his meeting with Mr. Milosevic. Administration officials adopted the line that the Russians had missed an opportunity to come out earlier for Mr. Kostunica and that Moscow still did not understand the force of the people power that undid Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Several officials also said they recognized that the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, was not in the mood to take steps to neutralize Mr. Milosevic in order to satisfy the United States.</p>
        <p>But by the end of the day, a senior administration official said that Mr. Ivanov apparently wanted to engineer Mr. Milosevic's televised concession speech so the Russian people would accept Mr. Kostunica's victory as a legitimate one.</p>
        <p>It remained unclear when or how the administration would work to ease sanctions, although Mr. Clinton said he believed that the people should be rewarded for their actions and that the suffering caused by the sanctions should end.</p>
        <p>''We should make an opening move here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The European Union, always more inclined to move quickly on sanctions than the United States, was likely to take some action on lifting sanctions on Monday, a European diplomat said.</p>
        <p>The major sanctions against Serbia consist of a ban on new investments, an embargo on oil and arms imports and some restrictions on flights by the national carrier, Yugoslav Airlines. If the role of Mr. Milosevic remains too unclear, the European Union might keep in place the freezing of the assets of his business colleagues and other figures in Serbia, the diplomat said.</p>
        <p>As the administration looked ahead to dealing with Mr. Kostunica, one official said no one was anticipating a ''love fest.''</p>
        <p>The new leader was praised as a democrat and a man who had the interests of his country, rather than himself, at heart.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kostunica had good relations with the nationalist political party in the Serbian part of Bosnia and was opposed to NATO's presence in Kosovo. Even so, because Mr. Kostunica was a constitutional lawyer, and had amply demonstrated in the last few days a distaste for violence, administration officials said they did not believe he would use the army or the police to crack down on the Albanian majority in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>They also said they believed that Mr. Kostunica's emphasis on the rule of law would lead him to respect the Dayton accords, which govern the NATO presence in Bosnia, and the United Nations resolution that governs NATO's role in Kosovo.</p>
