        <p>The nicest way to put it might be that ''Eureka'' is a movie that takes its time. During the second half of this murky, dawdling three-and-a-half-hour meditation on trauma and healing, written and directed by Shinji Aoyama, the camera trails its four major characters as they drift around southwestern Japan in a large bus.</p>
        <p>Although there is plenty to look at, the movie, filmed in sepia-toned black and white, reduces everything to the same muddy hue. And after a while, the dirt-colored landscape becomes almost unwatchably bleak.</p>
        <p>''Eureka,'' which the New York Film Festival is showing this morning at Alice Tully Hall, is determined that every last one of its desolate images sinks in. And they do, in the sense that anything you're forced to look at for a long enough time eventually registers an impression. Take the scene in which the camera observes the four travelers from a distance as they traipse like gloomy pilgrims across the length of a cow pasture (from one end of the screen to the other). The scene could be three minutes long or 30 minutes; your mind glazes over, and time just seems to hang there.</p>
        <p>It's deliberate, of course. ''Eureka'' wants to portray the world as it is experienced through the eyes of people who have lost their moorings and appetite for life because of a traumatic event. That trauma, depicted early in the film (here too, the camera observes from afar) is a random and unexplained bus hijacking in which several passengers are shot dead. The three survivors are the bus driver, Makoto (Koji Yakusho); a little girl, Kozue (Aoi Miyazaki); and her elder brother, Naoki (Masaru Miyazaki). The children, who are struck mute by the tragedy, move through the film like sleepwalkers. They are so glum and poker-faced they make ''The Addams Family'' children look like hyperkinetic little angels.</p>
        <p>The killings have left all three in such severe emotional shock that they are unable to resume their former lives.</p>
        <p>Makoto, after working as a day laborer for two years, eventually goes to live with Kozue and Naoki in a house overrun with dirty dishes and garbage. (The children live alone on money from insurance; their mother has run away with a boyfriend and their father died in a car crash.)</p>
        <p>Makoto becomes their surrogate parent, and they are joined by a cousin, Akihiko (Yohichiroh Saitoh), a vacationing college student who spends hours every day outside the house practicing his golf swing. To rouse the children from their stupor, Makoto buys a bus and equips it with beds, and the makeshift family of four hits the highway on a journey  that winds up at the sea.</p>
        <p>One inspiration for ''Eureka,'' its director has said, was the national trauma in Japan after the 1995 sarin gas attack in a Tokyo subway station. But the movie also clearly reflects a lingering horror over the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
        <p>As much as one might admire the film's uncompromising visual austerity, its grand long-distance tracking shots and its references to John Ford and Alain Resnais, ''Eureka''  never comes to life. When it throws in a half-baked subplot in which Makoto becomes the prime suspect in some serial killings, this allegory of modern anomie turns ludicrously  pretentious. In pursuing its aesthetic agenda so single-mindedly, the movie leaves the characters behind in the muck.</p>
        <p>EUREKA  Written, directed and edited by Shinji Aoyama; in Japanese, with English subtitles; director of photography, Masaki Tamra; music by Isao Yamada and Mr. Aoyama; production designer, Takeshi Shimizu; produced by Takenori Sento. Running time: 217 minutes. This film is not rated. Shown today at 10:30 a.m. at Alice Tully Hall as part of the 38th New York Film Festival.</p>
        <p>WITH: Sayuri Kokusho (Yumiko), Yutaka Matsushige (Matsuoka), Ken Mitshuishi (Shigeo), Aoi Miyazaki (Kozue Tamura), Masaru Miyazaki (Naoki Tamura), Go Riju (Hijack Man), Yohichiroh Saitoh (Akihiko), Kimie Shingyouji (Mother), Sansei Shiomi (Yoshiyuki Sawai) and Koji Yakusho (Makoto Sawai).</p>
