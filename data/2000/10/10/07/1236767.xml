        <p>Derek Jeter finished packing Wednesday night in Oakland and then wrote a check to the attendant for the visiting clubhouse for the customary tip baseball players give for receiving a few days of food and services. Jeter walked across the clubhouse and handed the check to the attendant, who then cheerily said, ''See you on Sunday.'' Jeter looked at the attendant and quickly said, ''I hope not.''</p>
        <p>While beating the tense Athletics, 4-2, in Game 3 of the division series last night at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees played like a team that did not want to fly to Oakland after tonight's game.</p>
        <p>The A's played like a team that suddenly peeked up, realized the address of this field was 161st Street and River Avenue and wondered if they belonged after all.</p>
        <p>Yankee Stadium can be intimidating. Trying to stifle the two-time World Series defending champions, even if they are bobbing and weaving, can be a significant challenge.</p>
        <p>Oakland Manager Art Howe said his young team would have fun against the Yankees as opposed to fearing them, but the A's were fidgety, and that is one of the reasons they could evaporate by tonight.</p>
        <p>For every snazzy defensive play the Yankees made, the A's seemed to make a silly one. Orlando Hernandez trudged to and from the mound as if  he had worked a 16-hour shift at a coal mine. But even without a crisp repertory, El Duque still managed to hold the A's to two runs in seven innings and somehow outdo Tim Hudson. Smelling a victory, Yankee Manager Joe Torre used closer Mariano Rivera for a rare and forceful two-inning save.</p>
        <p>''Every time Mo comes in,'' Jeter said of Rivera, ''we feel like the game is over.''</p>
        <p>It was and the series could be next, especially if the A's continue to be spooked by playing in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Rivera's face turned serious when he was asked if he felt the A's were unnerved as they bobbled a grounder, threw to the wrong base and flipped a ball away against a team that has won 10 straight home postseason games.</p>
        <p>''It's tough to play at Yankee Stadium,'' Rivera said. ''They've got 50,000 people cheering against them. I wouldn't want to have to play here.''</p>
        <p>Something bothered Hudson in the second. With runners on first and third, he fielded Glenallen Hill's high chopper and inexplicably whipped the ball home to try and get Bernie Williams. Hudson should have thrown the ball to first for the easy out. Williams scored to make it 1-1, and Hudson's misplay helped lead to New York's second run.</p>
        <p>''I made a very bad choice,'' Hudson said.</p>
        <p>Miguel Tejada darted into the shortstop hole for Jeter's bases-loaded grounder and, instead of collecting an out at third, had it glance off the palm of his glove for a single. Tejada also could not handle Ramon Hernandez's throw to second in the fourth, allowing Luis Sojo to cruise to third and later score the third run. Eric Chavez admitted the A's were nervous, but Howe said: ''We just didn't make plays that we can. I don't think it was because of the stage we were on.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Yankees shimmied around like they were playing a game in the backyard. Jorge Posada hustled to the backstop netting to catch a foul pop, while Scott Brosius leaned into the photographer's booth to snare another pop. David Justice saved a run by racing to the left center field warning track to catch a fly ball, and Sojo started one double play with a nifty diving stop and finished another with a deft pivot and a strong throw.</p>
        <p>When you grab the momentum in a three-of-five-game series, you better not surrender it and the Yankees did not. The Yankees were in a three-week daze and the funk carried into Game 1, but now they have won two straight games for the first time in two weeks. Slowly, they are becoming healthier and more dangerous.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone has written us off,'' Jeter said. ''Hopefully, the other teams will write us off, too.''</p>
        <p>Since the A's started younger players at eight of the nine positions, it is natural to think that they would be much fresher if the teams played tonight and had to trek 3,000 miles and play tomorrow. Jeff Nelson joked that the Yanks might need ''some Geritol,'' but he also emphasized the importance of never even testing the road weary theory.</p>
        <p>Beyond the difficulty of traveling cross-country for the second time in slightly more than three days, there would also be a psychological factor for the Yankees if they had to go west. Players have been snippy about answering how 14 losses in the last 17 regular-season games might have an impact on them in October. Now the Yankees have a chance to erase the questions, avoid a long trip and prolong their season. They simply have to win tonight.</p>
        <p>''Nobody wants to play a Game 5,'' Paul O'Neill said. ''Nobody wants to go back out there. You have a chance to win it at home and it's a lot more fun. That's when you want to do it.''</p>
