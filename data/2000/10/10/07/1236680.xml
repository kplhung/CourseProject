        <p>The Florida State quarterback says he has recovered from a sprained left ankle, his coach isn't so sure, and the Miami Hurricanes are just sorry that any sort of subplot may diminish a game they believe they are due to win -- though they have lost the two teams' last five meetings by an average of 22 points.</p>
        <p>This is the twisted logic that has often marked an intrastate rivalry that once meant something in the 1980's and early 1990's and possibly might again today. It's not as noisy as those trash-talking days when the Hurricanes cost the Seminoles three outright national titles and an opportunity at three others. That was then.</p>
        <p>This is now, and Florida State (5-0) is ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll and is aiming to repeat as national champion. In a bit of role reversal, Coach Bobby Bowden seems comfortable enough with starting the backup quarterback Marcus Outzen in place of Chris Weinke. He expects to play Outzen, a senior, because it is uncertain how effective the 28-year-old Weinke will be after participating in just one full practice in the past week.</p>
        <p>''Weinke looked better again,'' Bowden said before cautioning that a final decision may not be made until warm-ups Saturday and in concert with the offensive coordinator Mark Richt. ''Every day this week he has gotten progressively better. Chris took snaps from center and did some other things.''</p>
        <p>Bowden added: ''Marcus has had a good week of practice and he understands the philosophy so much better than he did two years ago. Marcus has got to keep the attitude this week that he is going to start this game. He has done everything we could ask of him.''</p>
        <p>The seventh-ranked Hurricanes (3-1), meanwhile, have been irritated that a victory over the Seminoles might be tainted by their rival's uncertain quarterback situation. After being upset, 34-29, by Washington in the second game of the season, they  see this game as a last chance to find their way back in the national title hunt.</p>
        <p>Their offense is ranked fourth in the country with a 50-point scoring average, and the sophomore quarterback Ken Dorsey has completed 59 percent of his passes for 969 yards and 9 touchdowns. The Hurricanes have perhaps the best wide receiver tandem in the nation; Santana Moss and Reggie Wayne have combined for 32 receptions for 507 yards and 6 touchdowns. Moss caught 9 passes for 180 yards and 2 touchdowns in the Hurricanes' 31-21 loss to the Seminoles last season.</p>
        <p>Thesenior-laden Hurricanes are also proud that they have come back from National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions handed down in 1995 that resulted in 31 lost scholarships and an outmanned team in recent years. They endured the lowest of lows together -- a 47-0 thumping by the Seminoles in 1997. Now, in their second season without sanctions, the Hurricanes are desperate for a high.</p>
        <p>''We've got all the athletes we need now; we've got no excuses,'' the senior linebacker Dan Morgan said. ''We are not going to change our game plan because of an injury.''</p>
        <p>Neither is Bowden. In big games as a starter, Outzen has an inconclusive 1-1 record. In 1998, he relieved Weinke after Weinke sustained a season-ending neck injury against Virginia, and won two games, including a triumph over Florida in the final game of the season. That triumph pushed the Seminoles to the national title game in the Fiesta Bowl, where they lost to Tennessee, 23-16.</p>
        <p>Weinke, however, insists he is healthy enough to add to his 26-1 record as the Seminoles' starter and pump up his Heisman Trophy caliber statistics: he has completed 64 percent of his passes for 1,478 yards and 12 touchdowns. His only loss came against North Carolina State in 1998, when he was a sophomore. He hasn't lost since.</p>
        <p>''I went through a full practice and I will be ready on Saturday,'' said Weinke, who passed for 332 yards and 2 touchdowns to beat Miami last season.</p>
        <p>Another reason Bowden seems unconcerned about going with either a backup or a banged-up quarterback is the Seminoles' smothering defense. The senior defensive end Jamal Reynolds already has 10 sacks, and the unit has scored in five consecutive games for 20 points. The Seminoles are so intimidating that they have allowed only 7 first-quarter points this season.</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes have at least one magical number on their side; they are 7-2 against the nation's No. 1 team in the Orange Bowl. They share another meaningful number with their rivals -- 28 players will have at least one high school teammate on the opposing sideline.</p>
        <p>The cruelest number of all perhaps belongs to Miami Coach Butch Davis, who is 0-5 against Florida State. He, too, believes it is time for a Hurricane victory.</p>
        <p>''There was absolutely no chance whatsoever to beat them back when the scholarships were way down,'' he said. ''As we've rebuilt the program the last couple of years, the games have become more competitive and closer. Certainly the next step along that is to win the game.''</p>
