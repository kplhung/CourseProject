        <p>Ninety minutes into Masterpiece Theater's six-hour rendition of ''Oliver Twist,'' even people only vaguely acquainted with the Dickens novel may be asking themselves a basic question: where the heck is Oliver?</p>
        <p>Alan Bleasdale, the British writer who adapted the novel for this production, has taken a brash, some would say presumptuous step: he has glued a lengthy prequel onto the master storyteller's already sprawling tale. So tomorrow's lead installment, instead of leaping forward from the opening birth scene to Oliver's ninth birthday as the book does, goes backward, telling how the young orphan came to be.</p>
        <p>We get to know Oliver's father, Edwin Leeford (Tim Dutton), a well-intentioned man who has managed to get Agnes, the love of his life, pregnant without mentioning that he's still married to someone else. We meet the lovely Agnes (Sophia Myles), Oliver's mother, and experience her struggles and shame. Most important, we meet Leeford's very angry, very greedy wife, Elizabeth (Lindsay Duncan), and their strange and scary son, Monks, Oliver's half-brother.</p>
        <p>Ms. Myles gives Agnes a touching melancholy, and the exchanges between Leeford and Elizabeth are alive with vitriol. ''Dictionaries should contain your name and particulars, Elizabeth,'' he tells her. ''Definition of evil: just your name and a brief description. Malignancy: your name again. Cruelty: see malignancy; see evil; see Elizabeth Leeford.'' Yikes.</p>
        <p>No, the prequel is not a bad story, but practically none of it is Dickens. Mr. Bleasdale has taken a short scene from late in the book and run with it, inventing details and dialogue and turning bit players into fully realized characters. The idea, he has said, was to make the story more palatable to contemporary audiences, setting up the conflicts and tensions in advance rather than tying them together with a hokey scene near the end, as Dickens did.</p>
        <p>Many purists, of course, will hate this. In any case, the prequel has an odd and certainly unintended effect: it makes Dickens look bad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bleasdale's opening is made for television in the pacing and in the plot development. But this only makes it more obvious, once the real Dickens shows up, that the novel was written in monthly installments over two years, with all the choppiness, repetition, dead-end characters and improbable connections that entails. It was one of Dickens's earliest and most amateurish works.</p>
        <p>So in contrast to Part 1, Part 2 of this ''Oliver Twist'' is often hard to follow, even though this is where we finally meet Oliver and all the other familiar characters. As Fagin (Robert Lindsay) and his band of little criminals try to tug the young Oliver into their netherworld and the goodly Mr. Brownlow (Michael Kitchen) tries to pull him back into respectable society, it is often difficult to keep track of who's who, where the boy is and what's motivating whom. Just as it is in the book.</p>
        <p>By Part 3, though, it all starts to come back into focus. And even if it doesn't, there is plenty worth watching along the way.</p>
        <p>Monks, Oliver's half-brother, is transformed from the shadowy presence in the novel into a main character, and Marc Warren's portrayal is searing. Sam Smith as Oliver is a find, managing to avoid that irritating angelic glow most child actors get in such roles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsay's Fagin is colorfully creepy, and his final moment on the screen is an inspired bit of cinematography. Also worth the wait is the rendering by David Ross (as Mr. Bumble, the beadle) of a certain famous line comparing the law to a four-legged beast.</p>
        <p>So if a 19th-century novel needs this much surgery to get on a modern-day television screen, is it time to put it out to an honorable pasture? Probably, though given Dickens's fan base, that seems unlikely. There's always another story doctor in the house.</p>
