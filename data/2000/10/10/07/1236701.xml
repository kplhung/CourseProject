        <p>After keeping his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine, on the defensive for weeks, Representative Bob Franks, the Republican candidate for Senate, suddenly found himself dealing with problems of his own making today.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Franks had to admit he had misspoken when he claimed he had never taken any campaign contributions from the National Rifle Association. Then his latest criticism of Mr. Corzine -- calling him anti-labor, despite his support from much of the New Jersey labor movement -- seemed to backfire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks came to the State House to accept the endorsement of a popular retired labor leader. But at a news conference here, he was asked why he had repeatedly claimed never to have received a campaign contribution from the N.R.A.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the Corzine campaign produced records showing that Mr. Franks had received $300 in 1986 and $500 in 1987 from the organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks called it an oversight. ''I've gotten thousands of contributions over the last 23 elections that I have run,'' he said today. ''I was personally not mindful of it, but more importantly, they made a terrible investment. No individual organization worked harder to defeat Bob Franks in 1992, when I sought to be elected to the Congress of the United States, than the N.R.A.''</p>
        <p>Tom Shea, a spokesman for Mr. Corzine, noted that Mr. Franks had not been so forgiving of Mr. Corzine's momentary lapses. ''We've already seen there seems to be one standard for Bob Franks and another for everybody else,'' Mr. Shea said.</p>
        <p>At his news conference this morning, Mr. Franks stood by as Charles H. Marciante, who was a longtime president of the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O, attacked Mr. Corzine as an ''opportunistic hypocrite'' for campaigning as a friend of working people.</p>
        <p>In an accompanying news release, the Franks campaign asserted that documents proved that Mr. Corzine's actions as chief executive officer of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company were ''blatantly anti-union.'' The documents cited, however, were a newspaper article in April 1999 about an effort by cafeteria workers at Goldman Sachs to organize under Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. The workers are employed by Restaurant Associates, a vendor to Goldman.</p>
        <p>But the article said nothing about Mr. Corzine, who had stepped down as co-C.E.O. of Goldman in January 1999 and remained at the firm until that May only to oversee its initial public stock offering. In fact, the union directed its organizing efforts at Henry M. Paulson Jr., who became the firm's sole chief executive in January 1999.</p>
        <p>Brooks Bitterman, the local's research director, said late today that it had begun organizing Goldman's cafeteria workers in December 1998 but that it did not approach management until March 1999. He said the union had no contact with Mr. Corzine until February of this year, when he and other union members visited Mr. Corzine at his Newark campaign office, seeking help.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bitterman said Mr. Corzine expressed support for the union's efforts at persuading Restaurant Associates to sign a right-to-organize agreement without engaging in a lengthy secret-ballot process. But he said Mr. Corzine alluded to his icy relations with Mr. Paulson. ''He said he would do whatever he could, but at the same time, he said he wasn't sure that it would help at all, given his relationship with Goldman,'' Mr. Bitterman said. ''He said he wouldn't talk to Paulson, but that there were others that he could talk to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bitterman said that Mr. Corzine did speak up on the union's behalf, to no avail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea, the Corzine spokesman, expressed disbelief at Mr. Franks's and Mr. Marciante's assertions. ''Why didn't the Franks campaign check it out before they put their candidate out there and had a press conference about it?'' he said.</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for Mr. Franks, Peter DeMarco, said the criticism of Mr. Corzine was still valid. ''The timeline clearly shows that while Jon Corzine was C.E.O., cafeteria workers did not have health insurance and were not allowed to organize,'' he said. ''He cannot attempt to take credit for successes at Goldman while blatantly denying responsibility for situations such as this.''</p>
