        <p>Op-Ed article by Misha Glenny says Serbs have finally awakened from their nightmare and dispensed with Slobodan Milosevic, who so devastated stability of Balkans; says Vojislav Kostunica, who is committed to democratic institutions, abhors violence and is not corrupt, will need great deal of help from West to overcome Milosevic's poisonous legacy; welcomes Euroepan Union's lifting of some sanctions as good first step; says it would be counterproductive at this time for West to demand Milosevic's extradition to The Hague to stand trial on war crimes charges, because Kostunica and many Serbs resent Hague's refusal to also indict NATO for killing of civilians during bombing campaign (M)</p>

        <p>Let us all stand and cheer the people of Serbia. Though heavily drugged by Slobodan Milosevic's opportunistic nationalism, they have finally awakened from  their nightmare and dispensed with the man who has so devastated the  stability of the Balkans. This was a truly popular revolution, carried out with determination and in pursuit of noble goals.</p>
        <p>Vojislav Kostunica is a constitutional lawyer, utterly committed to the democratic institutions that he understands so well. He abhors violence and is not corrupt, unlike most Serb politicians. This is why he is so popular. But while ordinary Serbs may celebrate, Mr. Kostunica cannot afford to. He and his colleagues must overcome the most severe difficulties in the coming year.</p>

        <p>Let us all stand and cheer the people of Serbia. Though heavily drugged by Slobodan Milosevic's opportunistic nationalism, they have finally awakened from  their nightmare and dispensed with the man who has so devastated the  stability of the Balkans. This was a truly popular revolution, carried out with determination and in pursuit of noble goals.</p>
        <p>Vojislav Kostunica is a constitutional lawyer, utterly committed to the democratic institutions that he understands so well. He abhors violence and is not corrupt, unlike most Serb politicians. This is why he is so popular. But while ordinary Serbs may celebrate, Mr. Kostunica cannot afford to. He and his colleagues must overcome the most severe difficulties in the coming year.</p>
        <p>Any one problem might bring Serbia's new democratic order tumbling down, and with it the possibility of stability in the Balkans. To combat these difficulties, he is going to need a great deal of help from the West.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Mr. Milosevic's poisonous legacy, the Yugoslav constitution, with its baffling multiplicity of federal and republican parliaments, is a mess. Tension between Montenegro and Serbia, the two parts of federal Yugoslavia, represents a special danger. Mr. Kostunica's power depends on keeping Montenegro in the fold.</p>
        <p>Elementary institutions must be rebuilt from scratch, starting with parliament itself. But the judiciary and the police, as well as the education and social security systems, require root-and-branch overhauls.</p>
        <p>The economy is deeply corrupted. According to the Belgrade sociologist Milan Nikolic, 70 percent of economic transactions take place in  ''the gray zone,'' free from regulation and taxation.</p>
        <p>Expectations are running high that life will improve swiftly. But because of the absence of foreign reserves, it will be hard to fulfill those popular expectations without considerable financial assistance from the West. Shock therapy will not work in Yugoslavia -- it would almost certainly kill the patient.</p>
        <p>The European Union's decision to lift sanctions on Yugoslavia is of enormous symbolic importance for both Mr. Kostunica and ordinary Serbs. It represents the first step on a long road back to international respectability.</p>
        <p>But one group of sanctions, the so-called outer wall, will remain in place. In contrast to the trade sanctions, these are not tied to whether Mr. Milosevic stays in power. They are linked to a complex dispute in international law, concerning the legal status of all the states that once made up Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>The outer wall blocks Yugoslav access to international financial institutions. Without that, Mr. Kostunica will find it enormously difficult to prevent a severe economic crisis. Yugoslavia desperately needs foreign currency to purchase imports, particularly as winter approaches.</p>
        <p>Full diplomatic relations between the West and Yugoslavia should be  restored as soon as possible to open vital lines of communications. The Yugoslav president also cannot avoid sensitive issues like the roughly 700 imprisoned Albanians from Kosovo in Serbian jails. Their continued presence weakens Yugoslavia's case for better protection for the Serb minority in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The West is demanding that Yugoslavia deliver Mr. Milosevic to the War Crimes Tribunal. This is a headache for Mr. Kostunica. He has stated he will not do so, declaring the tribunal to have lost credibility because it refused to indict NATO for the killing of civilians during its bombing campaign.</p>
        <p>Such a move would also play very badly in Belgrade. Down the road, when conditions inside Yugoslavia have stabilized, then the West could raise the issue of The Hague and explore the possibilities of Mr. Milosevic's extradition.</p>
        <p>But strident proclamations about war crimes, whether from politicians in the West or from Mr. Kostunica, are simply counterproductive. For the moment, everybody's overriding interest must be to assist Serbia's new leader as he tries to consolidate his authority and build a stable government in a country that is exhausted and traumatized by 13 years of Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
