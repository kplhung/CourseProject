        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio last night repudiated his decision to use money from his Washington allies to buy commercials in the New York Senate race, trying to avoid damaging his credibility on an issue that has become a cornerstone of his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said his campaign would reimburse the Republican National Committee for the amount that had been spent on the commercials: roughly $1.4 million.</p>
        <p>The announcement was an about-face, coming after a day in which he first defended the spending, going so far as to offer to have himself and his aides submit to lie detector tests to prove that they were not violating the rules agreed to with his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. The rules are  intended to keep the political parties from advertising in the race.</p>
        <p>Before abandoning his stance, Mr. Lazio also deployed his chief strategist, his communications director and two of the nation's most prominent election lawyers to hold a  conference call with 30 reporters and explain why the commercials were appropriate.</p>
        <p>Midway through the contentious 80-minute news conference, the campaign even decided it had to find its ailing campaign manager at his doctor's office so he could take part in the conference call (which was being surreptitiously monitored by a Clinton campaign aide who had somehow found a way to listen in).</p>
        <p>The Lazio team's message: the real culprit was the Clinton campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's move to pay back the money seemed more of a blow to his efforts to present himself as a reformer than to his treasury.</p>
        <p>He is not hurting for money, having raised nearly $30 million for his official campaign committee, more than Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>And under a complex arrangement, he will most likely be able to get new infusions of money from the Republicans in Washington, as long as he does not spend them on commercials.</p>
        <p>Under an agreement advanced by Mr. Lazio and supported by Mrs. Clinton, political parties and advocacy groups are not supposed to buy commercials in the race.</p>
        <p>While declining to say that he had violated the rules, Mr. Lazio said in a statement last night that he was acting ''in the spirit of protecting an agreement we worked so hard to create.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign seized upon the commercials and Mr. Lazio's subsequent disavowal of them, declaring that he was a hypocrite who had been caught maneuvering around the very deal that he had authored.</p>
        <p>''This ad sends one very clear message: New Yorkers cannot trust Rick Lazio to keep his word,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign would not say whether it would retaliate by asking the Democrats in Washington to buy commercials, and seemed to want to keep the matter alive for the second debate in the contest, which is set for tomorrow morning.</p>
        <p>In the first debate, last month, Mr. Lazio, hoping to turn campaign finance into a galvanizing issue for his candidacy, strode over to Mrs. Clinton's lectern and demanded that she sign a pledge renouncing the unregulated contributions known as soft money.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton demurred, but the two sides later reached an informal agreement to prohibit any spending, including hard or soft money, on commercials by entities other than the two campaigns.</p>
        <p>The agreement appeared to be threatened this week when a commercial that had been financed solely by the Lazio campaign began appearing in a different version, with the text saying that it was ''Paid for by Lazio 2000/The Republican National Committee.''</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign said it was appropriate to use the Republican money, asserting that in negotiations over the agreement barring spending by the political parties on commercials, both sides had resolved that there would be an exception for so-called coordinated spending.</p>
        <p>In Senate races, the national and state parties are legally allowed to channel a set amount of so-called hard money directly to their candidates' campaigns; in the New York contest this year, the figure is $1.8 million.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign responded on Thursday that it never agreed to such an exception, and accused the Lazio campaign of employing a loophole to buy more commercials.</p>
        <p>Appearing at a senior citizens center in Buffalo yesterday morning, Mr. Lazio responded vehemently to the suggestion that he was breaking the agreement. ''We would be the last people who would have a motive, by the way, to break the agreement,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said the Clinton campaign was eligible to spend $1.8 million in coordinated money from Democratic committees on commercials, and had every right to do so. And he suggested that Clinton aides were not telling the truth when they said they never agreed to allow coordinated spending.</p>
        <p>''If you want us to go under a lie detector test and you're willing to ask the same of the Clinton campaign, we're happy to do that,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson, the Clinton campaign spokesman, ridiculed Mr. Lazio's views. Mr. Wolfson pointed out that when the Lazio campaign distributed copies of its commercials to reporters, they were not the versions that included the mention of the Republican National Committee. Two commercials -- one promoting Mr. Lazio's record helping the disabled, the other an endorsement by Gov. George E. Pataki -- later appeared under R.N.C. financing.</p>
        <p>''If the Lazio campaign was so sure that this was O.K. -- that they were so confident that the R.N.C. money was within the bounds of the agreement, why didn't they release the R.N.C. ad to the media?'' Mr. Wolfson asked. ''Why did they pull a bait-and-switch?''</p>
