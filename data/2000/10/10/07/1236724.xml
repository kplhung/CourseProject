        <p>President Clinton expressed reservations today about Republican proposals to allow wholesalers to re-import low-cost American-made prescription drugs and to ease trade sanctions on Cuba, a day after House and Senate negotiators approved both proposals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also chastised Republican leaders for disregarding House and Senate votes favoring a measure to make hate-motivated attacks on gays a federal crime and instead rejecting the proposal during internal budget negotiations.</p>
        <p>''It was plain wrong,'' he said. ''I pledge to keep fighting for hate crimes legislation this year.''</p>
        <p>Late Thursday evening, House and Senate negotiators approved language on a larger agriculture spending bill to permit the sale of food, medicine and fertilizer to Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Libya and North Korea. But, in the case of Cuba, the bill would place severe restrictions on financing, prohibiting both American banks and the government from extending credit or loans.</p>
        <p>Cuba, a poor country, would either have to pay in cash or secure a loan from a foreign bank, most probably at high interest rates.</p>
        <p>The proposal would also turn into law existing regulations that bar American tourists from Cuba.</p>
        <p>Farmers, agribusiness and pharmaceutical companies had lobbied heavily for opening these markets in Cuba and the other countries. The pressure to act was acute among farm state Republicans.</p>
        <p>But two Republican Cuban-American lawmakers from Florida, a major battleground in the November election, managed to win major concessions from Republican leaders on financing and on travel to Cuba.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said today that he was not sure the bill would really help farmers.</p>
        <p>''What I have been told,'' he said, ''is it looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine, but it probably doesn't very much, because it doesn't provide any financing credits, which we give to other poor countries.</p>
        <p>''It certainly restricts in, I think, a completely unwarranted way, the ability of the United States to make travel decisions on policy that I do not believe should be made, written in law, in stone by the Congress. I think it's wrong.''</p>
        <p>Farmers stand to benefit most from exports of food and medicine to Iran, Sudan, Libya and North Korea. The president can, through waivers, permit American banks and the government to finance those exports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also said he was ''deeply disappointed'' by the Republican plan to permit the re-importing of prescription drugs. Though made in the United States, the drugs are cheaper in foreign countries because of overseas laws that limit their prices.</p>
        <p>Republicans and Democrats had been holding bipartisan meetings on the issue, but on Wednesday, Republicans broke away and wrote their own legislation, which they say addressed many Democratic concerns.</p>
        <p>The bill includes a five-year expiration date and language that Democrats say is too fuzzy and would give drug makers too much power. The bill, Mr. Clinton said, ''is more acceptable to the drug companies, all right,'' but does little to help the elderly and others who cannot afford drugs.</p>
        <p>While saying he was still reviewing the language, he urged Congress to ''work in a genuine spirit of bipartisanship.''</p>
        <p>On a separate bill, Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said the Senate would not try to override the president's expected veto of a $23.6 billion measure to finance energy and water projects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has objected to a provison in the bill forbidding the Army Corp of Engineers to study the possibility of increasing spring water flows on the Missouri River and decreasing them in the summer. The idea of changing the flows was to protect three threatened species: the piping plover, the least tern and the pallid sturgeon.</p>
