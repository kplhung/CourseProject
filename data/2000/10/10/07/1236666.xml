        <p>Vice President Carlos Alvarez of Argentina resigned yesterday to protest a cabinet reshuffling that left two officials in place who have been implicated in the possible bribing of senators to pass a new labor code.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez's resignation was a heavy blow to President Fernando de la Rua, whose popularity has slipped sharply since he took office 10 months ago. Mr. de la Rua's deficit-cutting policies have failed to rejuvenate a sluggish economy.</p>
        <p>''I respect the president but I cannot follow him passively,'' Mr. Alvarez told his supporters. Referring to what he called a deep moral crisis in Argentine politics, he added, ''You can't treat a cancer with aspirins. This situation requires courage and firmness.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez, who leads the left wing of the governing Alianza coalition, has argued for a change in economic policies and the removal of Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea. But his relations with Mr. de la Rua deteriorated seriously last month, when Mr. Alvarez pushed for a thorough investigation into allegations that several opposition senators had been bribed to vote for one of Mr. de la Rua's most important programs aimed at reducing business costs.</p>
        <p>As reports emerged that implicated Labor Minister Alberto Flamarique and Intelligence Director Fernando de Santibanes in the scandal, Mr. de la Rua supported them while Mr. Alvarez distanced himself from both. Both officials have denied wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>But a few hours after Mr. Alvarez had resigned, Mr. Flamarique resigned, saying he did not want to threaten the unity of the governing coalition further.</p>
        <p>Officials close to Mr. Alvarez said he was upset that Mr. Flamarique was promoted this week to become the president's chief of staff while the intelligence chief and economy minister were kept at their posts. The officials also said Mr. Alvarez was increasingly restive serving as president of the Senate when as many as 11 senators have been implicated in bribe taking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez did not immediately make a public statement. But Interior Minister Federico Storani told reporters that the vice president had told the president by telephone of his plans to resign. Mr. Storani said the two leaders would meet this weekend.</p>
        <p>''President de la Rua deeply laments this decision,'' Mr. Storani said. ''The government is absolutely committed to deepening investigations into any wrongdoing that may have taken place.''</p>
        <p>Social Development Minister Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a close ally of Mr. Alvarez, said the resignation would not jeopardize the alliance between Mr. de la Rua's centrist Radical Party and the social democratic Frepaso Party. ''Life goes on,'' she said, adding that Mr. Alvarez had ''told all of us in the Frepaso to continue in the government and remain loyal to the president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Machinea emerged strengthened by the shake-up, despite the disappointing performance of the economy. Unemployment has risen, from 14.5 to 16 percent in the last year, and tax increases and budget cuts have not succeeded in reducing budget deficits. Argentines have been wary about spending, and foreign investment has lagged because of increasing doubts about government policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Machinea promised in January that his policies would lead to at least 4 percent growth this year, after a 3 percent slide in 1999. But most economists now say the economy will grow this year by less than 2 percent.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Alvarez has emerged in polls as the most popular official because he has called for more vigorous policies.</p>
