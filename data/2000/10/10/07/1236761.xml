      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Arizona Diamondbacks asked for permission to interview the Yankees' hitting coach, Chris Chambliss, for their managerial vacancy, and similarly, Philadelphia will talk with the third-base coach, Willie Randolph, about the possibility of his replacing Terry Francona as the Phillies' manager.</p>
        <p>But after watching both men interview for jobs repeatedly in recent years, Yankees Manager Joe Torre hopes the interest in his two coaches is sincere and not merely an effort to appease the dictum of the Commissioner Bud Selig, who wants teams to consider minority candidates.</p>
        <p>''I hope it turns out to be more than an obligatory interview,'' Torre said. ''I know the way the commissioner wants things conducted, and in both Chris and Willie's case, you get your hopes up. But after a time, you're wondering if they have a legitimate shot.''</p>
        <p>''It pulls at your heart strings. I know during the time I was absent, I'd get a call here and there, and I'd get excited about it. When you don't get the job, it's very disappointing, and in their cases, they've been called more than I have.'' Torre did not manage from 1985 through 1989.</p>
        <p>Randolph said he was ''looking forward to sitting down and getting to know these people. I hope it's a fruitful conversation.'' But Randolph said that in the past, he had gotten the feeling that he was being interviewed because he was treated as a token black candidate, and not because there was genuine interest.</p>
        <p>''That's the way it is,'' he said. ''It's like that in any walk of life.''</p>
        <p>Randolph will have his interviews sometime before the start of the World Series. Chambliss is waiting to hear, officially, that he will have an interview with the Diamondbacks. ''It hasn't been any secret that I've wanted to manage,'' he said, ''and if that's the case, then I look forward to the opportunity to talk to them.''</p>
        <p>Asked about the qualifications of his coaches, Torre responded: ''I think Chris, because he's managed in the minor leagues, and he may, experience-wise, have more of an advantage. However, it depends on what that ball club is looking for. A personality might fit a certain situation.''</p>
        <p>Lee Mazzilli is also considered as a possible managerial candidate, and he, Chambliss and Randolph may all be in position for consideration for the Yankees' job whenever Torre's tenure ends.</p>
        <p>Clemens Sounds Confident</p>
        <p>Roger Clemens adjusted his workout schedule to prepare for his start today in Game 4, which will be his first in more than seven years on only three days of rest. ''I expect to be sharp,'' he said, ''and if I'm not, I'll find a way to get somebody out.</p>
        <p>''We heard talk they were going to go with three of us, and we were prepared to go with it.''</p>
        <p>Clemens has nine regular-season starts on three days' rest, and is 5-3 with a 4.12 earned run average. He is 1-1 with a 4.22 E.R.A. in four starts on three days' rest in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''If I have to expand the zone, East or West, North or South, I'll do it,'' Clemens said.</p>
