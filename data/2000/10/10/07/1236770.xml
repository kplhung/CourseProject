      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of picture caption Sept 30 about fighting in Jerusalem; wounded man was not Palestinian, he was American, Tuvia Grossman, and Israeli officer waving nightstick was not beating him</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A picture caption on Page A6 last Saturday about fighting in Jerusalem gave an erroneous identification from The Associated Press for a wounded man shown with an Israeli policeman. He was Tuvia Grossman of Chicago, an American studying at a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem, not an unidentified Palestinian. In some copies the caption also included the news agency's erroneous reference to the site. The incident occurred in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem, not on the Temple Mount or elsewhere in the Old City.</p>
        <p>A correction in this space on Wednesday cited the errors incompletely and omitted an explanation of the scene. The officer was waving a nightstick at Palestinians, telling them to stay away from Mr. Grossman. He was not beating Mr. Grossman.</p>
        <p>An article about the incident and the photograph appears today, on Page A4.</p>
