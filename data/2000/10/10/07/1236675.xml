        <p>The largest information technology contract ever awarded by the government, worth nearly $7 billion, has been won by the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, the United States Navy said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Electronic Data was chosen to build and maintain an internal computer network, the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet, to link sailors and Marines in the continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and Iceland. Ships at sea would be connected by satellites.</p>

        <p>The largest information technology contract ever awarded by the government, worth nearly $7 billion, has been won by the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, the United States Navy said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Electronic Data was chosen to build and maintain an internal computer network, the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet, to link sailors and Marines in the continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and Iceland. Ships at sea would be connected by satellites.</p>
        <p>The award represents the first time a branch of the military has turned over to a private company the responsibility and risk of operating and maintaining its entire network of computer systems.</p>
        <p>''The Navy and Marines are the first service branch to move to the private sector the intranet system, which is combining communications, desktop and software applications and doing it with information security,'' said William Dvoranchik, president of E.D.S. Federal, the subsidiary that deals with the government.</p>
        <p>''This is an exciting and rewarding day for us,'' Richard Danzig, secretary of the Navy, said at a Pentagon news briefing yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The new system is expected to be fully operational by June 2003. The Defense Department looks at it as a model for the military. By 2020, the Pentagon plans to link its war-fighting and intelligence-gathering networks in a vast system it calls the Global Information Grid.</p>
        <p>The announcement was made after the stock market close. During regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, E.D.S. slumped $1.44, to $40.63. But the stock jumped $6.88, to about $47.50, in after-hours trading after the announcement.</p>
        <p>The Navy picked Electronic Data over bids from the General Dynamics Corporation, the I.B.M. Corporation and the Computer Sciences Corporation.</p>
        <p>E.D.S., which has had a slower rate of contract signings than its rivals, was understandably jubilant with the result.</p>
        <p>''This is a great day for E.D.S.,'' said Richard H. Brown, the chairman and chief executive of the company, which is based in Plano, Tex. ''We were selected because we are the best. And I think the experience we gain from this mega-contract will serve us well to compete for similar projects for the Army and the Air Force.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts said they were somewhat surprised at the Navy's choice.</p>
        <p>''For investors, this is a fairly significant upset,'' said Mark Wolfenberger, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''Generally speaking, people expected Computer Sciences would be the winning bidder, if only because they have had a closer relationship with the Defense Department. But it is interesting because Computer Sciences has done a lot of work for the Army, and this was a Navy contract.''</p>
        <p>Computer Sciences' shares gained $5.31, to $77.06, yesterday during regular trading, and dropped to $71, down $6.06, after hours.</p>
        <p>''This is a testament to a much more competitive company,'' said Greg Gould, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. ''It highlights their ability to close contracts, and positions them well.''</p>
        <p>The contract is for a guaranteed minimum of five years, with a possible extension of three years at a minimum of $2.8 billion for each of those three years. The overall contract could be worth as much as $16 billion over the eight years.</p>
        <p>The Navy required that at least 35 percent of any business generated by the contract be earmarked for small businesses. Mr. Brown of E.D.S. said his company was committed to subcontracting 40 percent of the job to small businesses. A number of not-so-small subcontractors will also work on the project, a group that includes WorldCom, Cisco Systems, Dell Computer and Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Once completed, the Navy-Marine Corps system will allow, for instance, maintenance workers in a faraway country to pinpoint the availability of an airplane part anywhere in the Navy or Marine Corps system, or to contact the part manufacturer online.</p>
        <p>Secretary Danzig said the Navy was now spending about $1.6 billion a year on information services ''in piecemeal kinds of ways.''</p>
        <p>''We could achieve extraordinary economies of scale by buying in one central entity, in one central way, managing this centrally,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By the Navy's estimates, the new system will generate about $400 million a year in annual savings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said the system would save the Navy as much as $1 billion a year. ''In our proposal, we said we could save them the equivalent of a battleship a year,'' he said. ''This is a no-brainer financially for them to do this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said the contract would not have an impact on the bottom line at Electronic Data until 2002.</p>
        <p>''In the latter half of 2001, you will start to see revenue pickup,'' he said. ''But it will be full blown in 2002.''</p>
        <p>Including the Navy contract, E.D.S. has booked more than $26 billion in contracts this year, Mr. Gould from Goldman, Sachs said. That surpasses the record $25 billion in business the company booked in 1999.</p>
