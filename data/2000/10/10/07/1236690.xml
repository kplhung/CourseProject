        <p>The mark of a good air traffic control tower, say the controllers who guide the commercial jets on, off and across busy runways, is actually being able to see the planes.</p>
        <p>That was a problem in the new air traffic control tower at Miami International Airport, where four thick support columns on the outside of the structure obstructed the air traffic controllers' view of some parts of the runway, ramps and even approach paths of the planes.</p>
        <p>This week, responding to concerns  of air traffic controllers that the tower posed serious safety risks, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would demolish the control booth of the new tower and rebuild it to give the controllers a clearer field of vision.</p>
        <p>The safety risks presented by the new tower, which was scheduled to open this fall, were ''extremely serious,'' said Andrew Cantwell, president of the Miami branch of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.</p>
        <p>''Critical sight lines were obstructed, which would have reduced the margin of safety at Miami International Airport,'' the 10th busiest air traffic control tower in the country,  Mr. Cantwell said.</p>
        <p>''It was a huge concern,'' he said, ''especially considering the rising levels of traffic.''</p>
        <p>Air traffic controllers have been criticizing the design of the tower for years, and some air traffic controllers in Miami said they would have refused to work in the tower if it had been opened.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the four 14-inch-by-22-inch posts made it difficult for the controllers in the booth, or ''cab'' as they called it, to prevent runway collisions, the controllers said.</p>
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration had gone ahead with the tower's  construction over the protests of air traffic controllers here because it said controllers had signed off on the plans before work had begun.</p>
        <p>But on Thursday, responding to  controllers' concerns, the agency said it would not open the 320-foot, $18-million tower but would demolish the top and start over.</p>
        <p>The thick columns were needed to support radar equipment on the roof, and to make the building better able to withstand a hurricane with winds of 155 miles per hour. The radar was expected to remain on top of the tower.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cantwell and F.A.A. officials said today that they were glad the tower was to be rebuilt to make it as safe as possible.</p>
        <p>Eliot B. Brenner, a spokesman for the aviation agency, said, ''The important thing is, we've said yes, and we will have it done.''</p>
        <p>Engineers working for the aviation agency had tried to find a way to minimize the problems, but Mr. Cantwell said several crucial views were still obstructed.</p>
        <p>''It was extremely frustrating,'' Mr. Cantwell said.</p>
        <p>The changes will delay the opening of the tower for at least a year and will cost taxpayers an additional $4 million or more.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, air traffic controllers will keep using the old tower, which was rendered obsolete by the  $1.3 billion expansion of a terminal  by American Airlines. The expansion was expected to be completed in the next three or four years.</p>
        <p>The expansion of the terminal was expected to block the air traffic controllers' view of parts of the airport from the old tower, which is only 200 feet high.</p>
        <p>The air traffic controllers are expected to use camera systems to give them a view of obstructed parts of the airport, until the new tower is built.</p>
