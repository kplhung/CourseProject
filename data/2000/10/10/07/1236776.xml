        <p>Today's KEY GAMES</p>
        <p>NO. 1 FLORIDA STATE 5-0  NO. 7 at MIAMI 3-1  Florida State, the new No. 1 in the Associated Press news media poll, is averaging 50 points a game. Last Saturday, the Seminoles gained 613 yards in a 59-7 victory over Maryland, prompting Terrapins Coach Ron Vanderlinden to call his conqueror ''the most talented football team in the country.'' But Chris Weinke, Florida State's quarterback, has a sprained left foot, and Miami's good defense is getting better.TV: CH2, Noon</p>
        <p>NO. 10 OKLAHOMA 4-0  NO. 11 vs. texas (at Dallas)3-1  This traditional battle looks like a tossup. Texas quarterback Major Applewhite has passed for nine touchdowns and Oklahoma's Josh Heupel has eight this season. Last week, Heupel passed for 346 yards against Kansas, which had been leading the nation in pass defense (84 yards a game).</p>

        <p>NO. 10 OKLAHOMA 4-0  NO. 11 vs. texas (at Dallas)3-1  This traditional battle looks like a tossup. Texas quarterback Major Applewhite has passed for nine touchdowns and Oklahoma's Josh Heupel has eight this season. Last week, Heupel passed for 346 yards against Kansas, which had been leading the nation in pass defense (84 yards a game).</p>
        <p>NO. 6 MICHIGAN 4-1 at PURDUE 3-2  An even struggle between two of the Big Ten's endless store of present or past Top 25 teams. After a broken foot, Drew Henson is back full time as Michigan's quarterback. As long as Purdue has Drew Brees's passing, it may beat almost anyone.TV: CH7, Noon</p>
        <p>OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>EAST</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh (4-0) at Syracuse (2-2)  Syracuse seems to have awakened just in time for its Big East season.  TV: ESPN2, 4:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Yale (2-1) at Dartmouth (0-3)  Yale can pass, and Dartmouth can't stop the pass.</p>

        <p>Lafayette (1-3) at Columbia (1-2)  Columbia, with a big offense, folded at the end against Princeton.</p>

        <p>Louisiana State (3-2) at No. 12 Florida (4-1)  Florida quarterback Jesse Palmer has a sprained ankle; the ground game is feeble, and the defense is in disarray.</p>
        <p>No. 21 Tennessee (2-2) at No. 19 Georgia (3-1)  Despite Tennessee's ragged start, Coach Phillip Fulmer insists, ''We're still definitely in the hunt.''  TV: ESPN, 7 p.m.</p>

        <p>No. 4 Kansas State (5-0) at Kansas (2-2)  Kansas, slowed by six turnovers and six sacks, took a beating from Oklahoma. This should be more of the same.</p>
        <p>Penn State (2-4) at Minnesota (3-2)  Was Penn State's upset of Purdue the start of something good for the Nittany Lions? This game might tell.  TV: ESPN2, Noon</p>
        <p>Indiana (2-2) at No. 22 Northwestern (4-1)  On the last two Saturdays, Northwestern has upset Wisconsin and Michigan State while averaging 525 yards in total offense.</p>
