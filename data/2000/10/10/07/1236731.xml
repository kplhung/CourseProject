        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The losers in the vice-presidential debate were the American people (front page, Oct. 6). Here we saw two grown-ups having a civil, dignified, intelligent discussion of the issues and their philosophical differences. We are the losers for two reasons: the best men available for the job in 2000 are each at the bottom of their respective tickets, and neither one would have stood a chance of winning the presidential nomination of his party or would even have made it past New Hampshire, for that matter.</p>
