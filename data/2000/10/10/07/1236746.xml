        <p>The former spokesman for the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr was acquitted today of trying to hide his role in leaking information about Mr. Starr's investigation of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The defendant, Charles G. Bakaly III, was found not guilty by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, chief judge of the Federal District Court here, who heard the case without a jury in July. Mr. Bakaly would have faced up to six months in prison had he been convicted.</p>
        <p>''He and we are all, to understate the matter, pleased and gratified,'' a defense lawyer, Robert Weinberg, said after the verdict.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr's successor, Robert W. Ray, issued a statement concluding, ''This office accepts the judgment of the court.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly had been charged with contempt of court for lying to the judge about how much he contributed to an article in The New York Times on Jan. 31, 1999. That article, by Don Van Natta Jr., cited unnamed associates of Mr. Starr as saying he had concluded that he had the constitutional authority to indict Mr. Clinton while he was in office.</p>
        <p>The president's lawyers then filed a complaint with Judge Johnson asserting that Mr. Starr's office had leaked the information to influence the impeachment trial of Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In response to the complaint, Mr. Starr's office filed a declaration from Mr. Bakaly in which he said he had not provided any ''nonpublic'' information to Mr. Van Natta. Thereafter, Mr. Bakaly gradually disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he had provided The Times with some documents in connection with the article, and that he may have inadvertently confirmed some information for Mr. Van Natta.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Starr's office learned of Mr. Bakaly's later disclosures, it told Judge Johnson that the original declaration was inaccurate. The judge then initiated a criminal-contempt case and asked the Justice Department to prosecute. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bakaly resigned.</p>
        <p>''Lies upon lies,'' a prosecutor, Alan Gershel, said of Mr. Bakaly's accounts. ''Like a house of cards, they eventually came tumbling down.''</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers countered that Mr. Bakaly had never tried to pretend that he had provided no information, and that the only thing that mattered was the declaration. They said Mr. Bakaly had tried to modify that declaration as it was being drafted in Mr. Starr's office, and that not all his changes were included.</p>
        <p>Testifying in his own behalf, Mr. Bakaly recalled that Mr. Van Natta had come to him with information that he said he had gleaned from outside Mr. Starr's office about internal deliberations. ''I tried first to steer him from using this information,'' Mr. Bakaly said, recalling that he told Mr. Van Natta that his sources might not be well informed.</p>
        <p>''The key thing is, I did not give him any nonpublic information or information that related to grand jury matters,'' Mr. Bakaly insisted.</p>
        <p>In the end, Judge Johnson accepted that version of events. ''Even if some of his statements are misleading by their negative implication that Mr. Bakaly was not a source of information,'' she wrote, ''such a finding does not provide a sufficient basis for a criminal contempt conviction.''</p>
        <p>To a layman, the case may seem unusual, in that the same judge who initiated the case served, in effect, as both judge and jury in the trial. Judges are given considerable power, through contempt of court provisions, to enforce respect for the law and order in their courtrooms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly's case was atypical in another sense, too. Public officials, politicians and lawyers routinely make information available, or confirm it discreetly, in Washington. It is highly unusual for someone to face a serious threat of prison for doing so.</p>
