        <p>Bowing to a vast popular revolt against him, a pale Slobodan Milosevic resigned tonight as Yugoslavia's president, ending 13 years of rule that have brought his country four wars, international isolation, a NATO bombing campaign and his own indictment on war crimes charges.</p>
        <p>Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer of quiet habits and a firm belief in a future for Yugoslavia as a normal country within Europe, is expected to be inaugurated as president on Saturday.</p>
        <p>An already exuberant and chaotic Belgrade, celebrating its extraordinary day of revolution on Thursday, exploded with noise as the news of Mr. Milosevic's resignation, made in a short speech on television, quickly spread. Cars blasted their horns; people banged on pots and pans from balconies, blew whistles and danced in the street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic appeared on television about 11:20 p.m. -- shortly after Mr. Kostunica announced, on a television phone-in program, that he had met Mr. Milosevic and the army chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, this evening, and that both had congratulated him on his election victory on Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>The resignation deal was helped along by Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia, who met with Mr. Kostunica and Mr. Milosevic today. Mr. Ivanov was carrying assurances that if Mr. Milosevic gave up power now, the world would not press for his extradition to face war crimes charges in The Hague, senior Western officials said tonight.</p>
        <p>''I've just received official information that Vojislav Kostunica won the elections,'' Mr. Milosevic said in his television address. ''This decision was made by the body that was authorized to do so under the Constitution, and I consider that it has to be respected.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic spoke with a straight face after an extraordinary set of manipulations on his part -- of the Federal Election Commission and the highest court in the land -- to deny Mr. Kostunica outright victory.</p>
        <p>Speaking of how important it is for political parties to strengthen themselves in opposition, Mr. Milosevic said he intended to continue as leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia after taking a break ''to spend more time with my family, especially my grandson, Marko.''</p>
        <p>Despite his brave words, it is unlikely that the Socialist Party, with its own future to consider, will keep Mr. Milosevic as its leader for long. The remarks seemed part of a deal to save him a little bit of face.</p>
        <p>There is deep resentment in this semi-reformed Communist Party -- Serbia's largest and best organized, in power since World War II -- of Mr. Milosevic's indulgence of his wife, Mirjana Markovic, who began her own party, the Yugoslav United Left. Ruling in coalition, the Socialists saw more and more of their positions, powers and benefits going to the United Left.</p>
        <p>The reaction in Belgrade was immediate and loud.</p>
        <p>Tanja Radovic, a 23-year-old student blowing her whistle furiously on Knez Mihailova Street, said: ''He's gone. It's finally true. We had too much of him, it's enough. This is the end of him and all these thieves.''</p>
        <p>Dragana Kovac, 31, said: ''I'm happy, and not just because of him, but because of her. He should have spent more time with his family starting 10 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Ilija Bobic said: ''I wish all my family were alive to see this. My father used to say that the Communists would finish quickly. He was wrong, but it came true, finally.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bobic stopped, then said: ''We all know it won't be better quickly here. But now you can talk. You're not afraid of the phone, of being an enemy inside, of having to join the party to have a job.''</p>
        <p>The United States and Europe have promised a quick lifting of international sanctions against Yugoslavia, as well as aid, once Mr. Milosevic goes. The sanctions include a toothless oil embargo and a flight ban, currently suspended. But financial sanctions and a visa ban aimed at the Milosevic government are likely to remain in place for now.</p>
        <p>The United States and Britain have urged that Mr. Milosevic be handed over to the war crimes tribunal, and continued to do so publicly today. But Mr. Kostunica, who considers the tribunal a political instrument of Washington and not a neutral legal body, has made it clear that he will not arrest Mr. Milosevic or extradite him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's vow was also intended to give Mr. Milosevic the security to leave office, so that an electoral concession did not have to mean, as Mr. Kostunica said, ''a matter of life or death.''</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Ivanov came here today to deliver a similar message, Western officials said tonight.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Milosevic conceded and renounced power, even after the pillars of his rule collapsed this week, he and his family would be allowed to remain in Serbia, they said. But no Western country would say so publicly, given the United Nations tribunal's indictment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica has pointed out that if democratic and international stability is at stake, the requirement to pursue those indicted is secondary under international law.</p>
        <p>The collapse of Mr. Milosevic's position came soon after Mr. Ivanov met him this morning in Belgrade. This afternoon, the Constitutional Court suddenly issued its ruling approving Mr. Kostunica's appeal of the election results.</p>
        <p>The official press agency Tanjug said on Wednesday night that the court had decided to annul the main part of the Sept. 24 presidential vote, implying a repeat of the election. But then the court said that in fact Mr. Kostunica had won the first round outright, with more than 50 percent of the vote, precisely as he has insisted. It was another example of Mr. Milosevic's manipulation, but this time to others' ends.</p>
        <p>Then the speaker of the Serbian Parliament, Dragan Tomic, one of Mr. Milosevic's closest allies, announced that he would convene that body on Monday to recognize Mr. Kostunica's election as federal president. He addressed a letter to Mr. Kostunica this way: ''To the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.''</p>
        <p>The election of Mr. Kostunica -- carried to power first by the votes of a majority of Serbs, and then by an uprising by even more of them -- will present difficulties and opportunities for Montenegro and Kosovo, both parts of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>The Western-leaning president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, will find himself offered a new deal within Yugoslavia that will be aimed at blunting the effort toward independence. That may quickly undermine Mr. Djukanovic's governing coalition in Montenegro, which contains parties firmly backing independence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djukanovic boycotted the federal elections, allowing Milosevic allies to win all of Montenegro's seats in the federal Parliament. Those allies are now likely to make a deal with Mr. Kostunica, abandoning Mr. Milosevic, and leaving Mr. Djukanovic in effect powerless in a Belgrade that could quickly become the center for democratic life in the Balkans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica will also offer Kosovo a high degree of autonomy. While outside powers recognizes Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic was a perfect foil for Kosovo Albanian desires for independence, which have only grown stronger since NATO intervened on the Albanians' behalf in the 1999 bombing war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica says he will live within United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, governing Kosovo, but will insist on the return of Serbs who fled during the war.</p>
        <p>In his television appearance, Mr. Milosevic thanked those who voted for him and even those who voted against him, ''because they lifted from my soul a heavy burden I have borne for 10 years,'' he said. He also said a time in opposition would be good for the left coalition, to allow them to purge those who got into the party ''to feed some personal interest,'' an extraordinary comment for a leader who allowed a form of state-sanctioned mafia to develop.</p>
        <p>''I congratulate Mr. Kostunica on his election victory and wish for all citizens of Yugoslavia great success during the new presidency,'' he concluded.</p>
        <p>In his own television appearance, Mr. Kostunica described his meeting with Mr. Milosevic. ''It was ordinary communication, and it's good that we met, because there was a lot of fear over the peaceful transfer of power, especially last night,'' Mr. Kostunica said.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time for many years in this country that power has been transferred normally, in a civilized manner,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And he said he pointed out a lesson to Mr. Milosevic: ''I talked about how power, once lost, is not power lost forever. You can regain it. This is something that all my experience taught me. The other side couldn't even imagine something like this, but now the other side has accepted this, and it is getting used to this lesson.''</p>
