        <p>Three and a half weeks after the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee entered a plea agreement that the government said would resolve urgent issues of national security, the government has not yet scheduled a meeting with Dr. Lee.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors want to know why Dr. Lee downloaded a trove of nuclear weapons secrets and what happened to seven missing computer tapes packed with information. But despite the government's insistence on the urgency of these questions -- the lead prosecutor, George Stamboulidis, had said hundreds of millions of lives hung in the balance -- the prosecutors canceled their first appointment to debrief Dr. Lee and have not spoken with his lawyers about scheduling another one.</p>
        <p>Kara Peterman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department would have no comment until the debriefings had been completed.</p>
        <p>Some critics of the prosecution of Dr. Lee, especially Asian-American organizations, have called for an independent investigation of the case and have questioned why, if the government had such an urgent need to learn about the missing tapes, it has ignored the issue so far.</p>
        <p>''We're anxiously awaiting to hear about Dr. Lee's debriefings, but they haven't even begun yet,'' said Henry Tang, the chairman of the Committee of 100, a Chinese-American organization. That group and others have argued that Dr. Lee, a naturalized citizen born in Taiwan, was singled out for prosecution because of his race, not his deeds.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee's lawyers said that he had been meeting with them regularly to prepare for what are expected to be extensive debriefings but that he was mostly enjoying his freedom at his home near Los Alamos, N.M., after more than nine months in solitary confinement. Dr. Lee, who was released after his plea hearing on Sept. 13, has, among other things, been gardening, cooking, meeting with friends and fishing, the lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee had been charged with 59 counts of illegally downloading classified data and using the information to harm the United States and aid a foreign country. The charges, which he denied, could have brought him a life sentence.</p>
        <p>The government finally agreed to drop 58 of the 59 charges -- he admitted only that he had improperly downloaded secrets -- in a deal that included a sentence of the time he had already served, with no probation, and his agreement to cooperate with the investigators.</p>
        <p>An initial meeting was set up for Sept. 26, but the government canceled it, saying that officials had to prepare for Congressional hearings on Dr. Lee's case. In those hearings, a number of top Clinton administration officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno and the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh, have insisted that they got what they wanted out of the plea deal: immediate answers to their questions about the missing tapes.</p>
        <p>The government has yet to ask its first question, however, and it is not clear when it will.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of Dr. Lee's plea deal, he has provided two affidavits, each just a couple of pages long and currently sealed by the court, in which he said that the missing tapes, and copies that he made of some of the tapes, had been destroyed, and that no other person was shown or had access to the information.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee also agreed that he would, under oath, answer all the government's questions about the tapes and his downloading, including why he made the tapes and what use he made of them. Under the agreement, the debriefings could go on for 10 working days spread over three weeks, up to six hours each day.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee also agreed to identify any places he stored classified information, whether in his home or on a computer, and that the government could search them. He said he would submit to a polygraph if the government demanded one to verify his statements about the tapes.</p>
        <p>And, if the government wanted to question him further, Dr. Lee agreed to make himself available for up to a year from the time he entered his guilty plea.</p>
