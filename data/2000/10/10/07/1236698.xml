        <p>The ''magic place'' that Vice President Al Gore was talking about today was Walt Disney World, but in political terms, it could easily have been the state of Florida, which is becoming increasingly central to a strategy that his campaign believes could give him a landslide victory in November.</p>
        <p>The polls have Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in a statistical dead heat here, just as they have been in national race. And with Mr. Bush's brother Jeb as the governor and leader of a strong political machine here, no one is counting the Republicans out. But the Gore campaign is making increasing investments here with the candidate's time and the campaign's money, two of the strongest indications that Mr. Gore perceives an opening in Florida that could catapult him to the White House.</p>
        <p>The conventional wisdom is that Mr. Gore can win the election without Florida but that Mr. Bush cannot. Of the populous states, Mr. Gore appears to have California and New York in his pocket, and probably Pennsylvania and Illinois. Mr. Bush can count on Texas, but beyond that, Ohio is the next-biggest state where he is slightly ahead, and that lead appears tenuous. Without Florida, Mr. Bush has a hard time gathering enough electoral votes to put him over the top. With Florida, Mr. Gore could win in an electoral landslide.</p>
        <p>''This state is the key to the election, and central Florida is the key to this state,'' Mr. Gore declared at an outdoor rally today at the Walt Disney Amphitheater beside placid Lake Eola.</p>
        <p>''My family and I love central Florida so much we have vacationed here,'' the vice president gushed on. ''Tipper and I were trying to count the number of times -- three times when our kids were little and several times beyond that. We came to Florida right after the election. When our kids were little, we used to particularly enjoy coming to Disney World and Universal and Sea World. This is a magic place for all the world.''</p>
        <p>His campaign is not counting vacations but campaign events. Since the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, Mr. Gore has visited Florida 11 times. That compares with 13 times for George Bush, who plans to return tomorrow, and is scheduled to ride across the central part of the state in a bus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore spent four days in Florida just last week, when he prepared for the first presidential debate. And he is planning to return in a couple of days for another four-day preparation session for the next debate, scheduled for Wednesday in North Carolina. At the party convention, he engineered the roll call of states so that Florida could officially give him the nomination. And in what was perceived as a move to help motivate voters for Mr. Gore, President Clinton flew to Florida to watch the Gore debate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore dropped in last night from Michigan just to watch the debate between the vice-presidential candidates in a symbolic gesture to show that Florida was important. At his rally today, Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, were joined by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, his running mate, and his wife, Hadassah.</p>
        <p>The show of force was another overt play for Florida, and an effort to activate Democratic voters. Mr. Gore's selection of Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew on a national ticket, has played particularly well with Florida's large Jewish population, and Mr. Lieberman appeared thrilled today to be here with the Gores.</p>
        <p>''We call this double-dating,'' he gurgled to the crowd of a few thousand. ''And it's great to be on a se double-date in Orlando.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said today in an interview with WTVT of Tampa that of the next four weeks until the election, he expected to spend a total of about one week in Florida, some of it for debate preparation.</p>
        <p>Is all of this attention paying off?</p>
        <p>Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida, said the state had seen so much of the presidential candidates that voters were becoming blase.</p>
        <p>''It was one thing when you were the prom queen and being courted,'' Ms. MacManus said, ''but after a while, when everyone wants you all the time, it's not the same.''</p>
        <p>Ms. MacManus said that she believed that Mr. Gore's multiple visits here were intended to send a message more broadly to older Americans across the country.</p>
        <p>''Florida is a symbol of the senior vote that's very critical in a lot of places,'' she said. ''When he comes to Florida and talks about those issues, it gives him credibility.''</p>
        <p>Polls here and nationally give Mr. Gore a decided edge with voters older than 65. In Florida, one in three voters is over 65, and Mr. Gore highlighted several subjects of interest to older voters today. For one thing, he said that Mr. Bush would bankrupt Social Security.</p>
        <p>''We give you a generous incentive to save and invest, not at the expense of Social Security but on top of Social Security, so that you can set aside money without putting at risk the basic safety net that Social Security represents,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan, he said, ''would cause the bankruptcy of Social Security in a single generation.''</p>
        <p>But he also spoke to the parents who are swing voters and those who are prospering in the state's I-4 corridor. He talked about increasing time available under the Family and Medical Leave Act for parents to take time off for meetings with their children's teachers, and he warned against the ''cultural pollution'' coming from Hollywood.</p>
        <p>''Parents need help in a mass culture that doesn't always respect children,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Both presidential campaigns are advertising heavily here, and with the competition keen for some state and local races, watching television here is like watching one long nonstop political commercial. The Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee spent more than $6.2 million on commercials here between June 1 and Sept. 20, while the Gore campaign and the Democratic National Committee have spent about half that.</p>
        <p>Ms. MacManus, for one, said that the key for Mr. Gore would be a strong turnout among blacks, who accounted for 10 percent of the vote in the 1996 presidential election.</p>
        <p>Hispanics accounted for about 12 percent of that vote, according to polls of people as they left the voting booth, and this year Hispanic voters are leaning toward Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>That makes the black vote even more important this year. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has already devoted $400,000 for get-out-the-vote efforts in Florida, and Gore aides say more efforts will be made.</p>
        <p>Today's visit was a nod to the growing number of Hispanics who have settled in east-central Florida. And at his rally here, Mr. Gore took advantage of a perk of incumbency by referring to recent flood damage in Miami and the federal government's disaster aid.</p>
        <p>''I would like to say from my heart here that all of us are standing in solidarity with those who have suffered in Miami-Dade County,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At a predebate party on Thursday night in Orlando, Mr. Gore declared:  ''This state of Florida will pick the next president of the United States. This state of Florida will be decisive in this election. This state of Florida is the one that will have such a powerful voice.''</p>
        <p>And he framed his many trips to Florida as central to his election, which he is casting increasingly as a moral imperative.</p>
        <p>''I truly believe that this is such an important moment in American history with such a great opportunity to do the right thing,'' Mr. Gore said at the party.</p>
        <p>''We must resist the temptation to make the irresponsible choices,'' he said. ''We have to act responsibly, and instead we have to put the people of this country first. That is why I am running. That is why I'm spending so much time here in Florida.''</p>
