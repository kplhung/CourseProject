        <p>From the day he arrived as music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1991, Kurt Masur wanted to present Mendelssohn's serenely beautiful oratorio ''St. Paul,'' an early masterpiece that seldom turns up on programs today. As a Mendelssohn champion who held the same post the composer once did, music director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Mr. Masur could not believe that the Philharmonic had never played the work.</p>
        <p>He finally got his way. On Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall the Philharmonic performed ''St. Paul,'' with Mr. Masur, visibly moved, on the podium. It took some doing. The stage had to be extended out over the first few rows of seats in the orchestral section to accommodate the performing forces: a large orchestra plus organ, four vocal soloists, the 175-voice Westminster Symphonic Choir (Joseph Flummerfelt, director) and the 35-voice American Boychoir (James Litton, director). This affecting performance was a milestone in Mr. Masur's tenure.</p>
        <p>Mendelssohn worked on ''St. Paul'' from 1832 to 1836 while still flush with inspiration from having conducted the historic revival of Bach's ''St. Matthew Passion'' in Berlin in 1829, when he was 20. In some ways ''St. Paul'' is Mendelssohn's homage to the Bach passions and the Handel oratorios, works he understood as few other musicians of his day did.</p>
        <p>As the product of a wealthy Jewish family that converted to Christianity when he was a boy, Mendelssohn was personally drawn to the biblical story of Saul of Tarsus, the doctor of Judaic law and zealous persecutor of Christians, who had an epiphany on the road to Damascus and became Paul, the early church's most effective missionary.</p>
        <p>As with Bach's Passions, choral settings of familiar chorale tunes recur throughout ''St. Paul,'' providing structural posts for the composition that also serve as moments to reflect on the unfolding drama. Indeed the work begins with a familiar chorale tune, ''Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme,'' in Mendelssohn's elaborate setting: sturdy block harmonies in the chorus are encircled by intertwining contrapuntal lines in the orchestra, buttressed by pealing pedal tones of the organ.</p>
        <p>Mendelssohn's most daring stroke is the way he merges recitatives, arias, chorales and choruses into a constantly flowing musical narrative. This too he learned from studying Bach passions. Indeed whole passages in ''St. Paul'' can sound today like richly Romantic arrangements of Bach and Handel.</p>
        <p>But the melodic inventiveness and expressive grace are Mendelssohn's own. The only shortcoming is the music's tame, for its day, harmonic language, which is euphonious, lucid and beguiling but seldom surprising.</p>
        <p>While giving full due to the work's dramatic sweep, as in the slashing chorus that depicts the stoning of St. Stephen, Mr. Masur conducted a beautifully restrained performance, eliciting luminous playing from the orchestra and robust singing from the assembled choristers. Replacing the British tenor Ian Bostridge, who withdrew because of a death in his family, was Stuart Neill, whose beefy operatic voice is totally different from Mr. Bostridge's lean, refined tenor. Mr. Neill sang admirably, as did the soprano Edith Wiens, the mezzo-soprano Margaret Lattimore and, in the role of Paul, the baritone Christopher Maltman.</p>
        <p>The decision to perform the work in Mendelssohn's own English adaptation of the text rather than in the original German was surely Mr. Masur's gesture to his American audience. But no texts were provided, and it was almost impossible for the chorus to project the words clearly while dispatching all the counterpoint.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masur has his limitations as a music director. But here he was at his best. He must have been disappointed to see so many empty seats in the hall. One hopes that this will change for the final performances tonight and on Tuesday.</p>
