      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The theme of imprisonment has been popular in French Canadian and European modern dance. The latest piece to go that route is ''Bagne,'' presented by PPS Danse of Montreal on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater. There is no solid four-walled prison, though the title of the dance is said to translate colloquially to ''slammer.'' Bodies do slam against walls for much of this 70-minute duet. But, tellingly, those walls are made of metal mesh that gives with the impact. ''Bagne'' is one of the gentlest and least brutal prison pieces to career through New York. It has more on its mind than exploring a threadbare metaphor.</p>
        <p>The opening night performance was danced by the choreographers, Pierre-Paul Savoie and Jeff Hall, who alternate with a female cast (Carole Courtois and Sarah Williams). It is hard to imagine that the tone changes much from cast to cast. ''Bagne'' is about love and hate in an atmosphere of charged, contained physicality. Even more, however, ''Bagne'' is a formal exploration of gravity, propulsion and space.</p>

        <p>The theme of imprisonment has been popular in French Canadian and European modern dance. The latest piece to go that route is ''Bagne,'' presented by PPS Danse of Montreal on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater. There is no solid four-walled prison, though the title of the dance is said to translate colloquially to ''slammer.'' Bodies do slam against walls for much of this 70-minute duet. But, tellingly, those walls are made of metal mesh that gives with the impact. ''Bagne'' is one of the gentlest and least brutal prison pieces to career through New York. It has more on its mind than exploring a threadbare metaphor.</p>
        <p>The opening night performance was danced by the choreographers, Pierre-Paul Savoie and Jeff Hall, who alternate with a female cast (Carole Courtois and Sarah Williams). It is hard to imagine that the tone changes much from cast to cast. ''Bagne'' is about love and hate in an atmosphere of charged, contained physicality. Even more, however, ''Bagne'' is a formal exploration of gravity, propulsion and space.</p>
        <p>There is considerable visual beauty in the ways the two bodies are juxtaposed and in the set's uncompromising geometry. Self-propelled and set into motion by each other, the men crash against, climb up and crawl across the movable steel walls in almost cinematic frames.</p>
        <p>There are poignant moments, mostly having to do with the way the men's hands delicately touch each other's bodies and play the mesh grille of one wall as if it were a piano.  As poignant and subtle is the quietly awestruck way the two men survey the world outside their walls. Mr. Savoie, the founder of PPS in 1983, and Mr. Hall do give in to easy emotion toward the end. But before then, ''Bagne'' takes a familiar theme and does unexpected things with it, at an interestingly deliberate pace.</p>
        <p>Bernard Lagace's shimmering set includes a backdrop that looks like a solid mosaic wall at one minute and a glowing, trembling curtain the next. In the climactic moment of ''Bagne,'' a body dropping through space crashes into the curtain, sending it into convulsive motion. Marc Parent's lighting ingeniously creates a sense of small enclosed spaces and the passage of time.</p>
        <p>''Bagne'' is performed to a thickly textured sound-and-music score by Ginette Bertrand, with interpolations of a waltz by Mireille Demers, a puzzling radio broadcast and a bit of harmonica-playing by Mr. Hall. Paule-Josee Meunier designed the men's fatigues. ''Bagne'' will be performed through tomorrow night at the Joyce.</p>
