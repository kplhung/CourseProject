        <p>Milosevic Yields Power In Face of Popular Revolt  Slobodan Milosevic, bowing to a vast popular uprising against him, resigned as president of Yugoslavia, ending 13 years of rule. The opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, is expected to be inaugurated today. The resignation was helped along by Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia, who met with Mr. Kostunica and Mr. Milosevic. Senior Western officials said Mr. Ivanov had offered Mr. Milosevic assurance that if he gave up power now, the world would not press for his extradition to face war crimes charges in The Hague.</p>

        <p>The European Union officially recognized Mr. Kostunica as the new president and announced that its foreign ministers would move to lift sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia last year, making good on a promise to reward the Serbs if they ousted Mr. Milosevic in the elections Sept. 24.</p>

        <p>President Clinton hailed the developments as a triumph for the people of Yugoslavia and promised to work with Europe to lift the sanctions.</p>

        <p>Israeli-Palestinian Clashes  Israeli and Palestinian authorities struggled to keep the Friday Prayers at the Al Aksa mosque in Jerusalem's Old City from ending in a blood bath and further inflaming the latest Israeli-Arab conflict. Despite the efforts, a short-lived calm disintegrated and clashes erupted, there and in the West Bank and Gaza, to add at least seven more Palestinian deaths to the mounting toll.</p>

        <p>Thousands gathered near Times Square, in Manhattan, at rush hour to protest the killings of Palestinians and American support for Israel.</p>

        <p>Japan Struck by Quake  The most powerful earthquake in five years struck western Japan at 1:30 p.m., hurting at least 100 people, damaging buildings and disrupting electric power. The 10-second quake was measured at 7.3 magnitude.</p>

        <p>Gentility of Debate Hid Weapons Under the Table  Strategists on both sides said the decision to hold to a more courtly tone in the vice-presidential debate was made on the fly, by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and Dick Cheney, though each had been prepared to respond if the other attacked. While some of the 28.5 million television viewers confessed to being slightly bored with a thoughtful, informative debate free of rancor and with minimal posturing, others said they were left feeling braced. But the debate did not appear to have changed many minds, nor did strategists think it would influence the two remaining debates between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Bush's Plan to Fight Drugs  Gov. George W. Bush accused the Clinton administration of fighting illicit drugs ''without urgency, without energy and without success'' and proposed $2.7 billion in grants to groups and schools to combat narcotics and provide treatment.</p>

        <p>Republicans, including Dick Cheney, unleashed strong assaults on the vice president's credibility.</p>

        <p>Clinton Faults G.O.P. Actions  President Clinton expressed reservations about Republican proposals on Capitol Hill to allow the importation of low-cost prescription drugs and to ease trade sanctions on Cuba, and chastised Republicans for dropping a measure to make hate attacks on gays a federal crime.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Judge Acquits Starr Aide  Charles G. Bakaly III, the former spokesman for the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, was acquitted in a nonjury trial of a charge of contempt of court. Mr. Bakaly was accused of trying to hide his role in the leaking of information about Mr. Starr's investigation of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>House Passes Servitude Bill  The House approved a wide-ranging measure that helps states and local governments fight domestic violence and toughens laws against the trafficking in women and children for prostitution and sweatshop labor.</p>

        <p>Tempering Optimism on Surplus  The Congressional Budget Office warned that although the fiscal outlook for the next decade or so was bright, and getting brighter, the picture over the longer run remained troubled, even dire.</p>

        <p>Judge Finds No Intimidation  A federal judge rejected claims by lawyers for Wadih el-Hage that the government tried to intimidate potential witnesses in his terrorism case by issuing them grand jury subpoenas as the trial approached. The case involves the bombing of two United States embassies in Africa that left more than 200 people dead and thousands injured.</p>

        <p>Stock Markets Plunge  The Nasdaq fell 111.09 points, or 3.2 percent, to 3,361.01, and is now off 17.4 percent for the year. The S.&amp; P. 500 dropped 27.29 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,408.99, off 4.1 percent for the year. The Dow fell 128.38 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,596.54, down 7.83 percent in 2000. Investors cited concern about corporate earnings and dismissed a generally positive employment report for September.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Unemployment fell to 3.9 percent in September, once again matching the lowest level since 1970, and the nation's employers added 204,000 new jobs. The drop in unemployment from 4.1 percent in August included a decline in black unemployment to 7 percent -- the lowest level in history. But for many economists, the signs of strength were more an anomaly than the beginning of a rebound after months of declining job creation.</p>

        <p>Big Navy Computer Contract  The Navy awarded Electronic Data Systems a nearly $7 billion contract for an internal computer network, the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet, to link sailors and Marines in the continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Iceland and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It is the largest information technology contract the government has ever awarded.</p>
