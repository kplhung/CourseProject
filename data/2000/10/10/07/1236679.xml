        <p>Four years ago, facing the very real prospect that a hostile Republican Congress would put it out of business, the federal Legal Services Corporation agreed to accept a set of harsh restrictions on the sort of work that lawyers supported by the program could perform on behalf of their poor clients.

        <p>Four years ago, facing the very real prospect that a hostile Republican Congress would put it out of business, the federal Legal Services Corporation agreed to accept a set of harsh restrictions on the sort of work that lawyers supported by the program could perform on behalf of their poor clients. That fateful bargain gave rise to an awkward showdown in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, as lawyers for the corporation and the Clinton administration tried to defend one of the more pernicious elements of the G.O.P.'s assault. That was the restriction limiting the kinds of arguments that Legal Services lawyers can make on behalf of welfare clients.</p>
        <p>Under the provision, poverty lawyers whose offices receive federal money may seek benefits on behalf of their clients, but are barred from bringing actions seeking to ''amend or otherwise challenge'' the regulation or statute that prevents their clients from obtaining benefits. A year ago, a federal appeals court in New York properly invalidated the provision on grounds that its attempt to stifle criticism of government policy amounted to ''viewpoint discrimination'' by the government, impermissible under the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>The administration argued that Congress had broad leeway to decide what policies and programs it would promote, citing a misguided 1991 Supreme Court decision that upheld a ban on abortion counseling by family planning clinics that received federal money. But Justice Anthony Kennedy was rightly troubled. Challenging a government policy in court, he said, is ''the paradigm of free speech, a petition to the government.'' Similarly, Justice David Souter suggested that by silencing disagreement with government policy, Congress had struck at ''the molten core'' of the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>Apart from the important free-speech issue, the justices -- lawyers themselves, after all -- seemed concerned by the difficulty of having to represent a low-income client with key arguments foreclosed. The restriction, said Prof. Burt Neuborne of New York University Law School, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, is ''a core interference with what attorneys ordinarily do for clients.''</p>
        <p>Congress trampled on free speech and the principle of equal justice under law when it sought to muzzle Legal Services lawyers, and the court's ultimate ruling should mince no words in saying so.</p>
