        <p>THE State Capitol is quiet as Lt. Gov. Rick Perry ambles out of his corner office behind the Senate chamber and greets two visitors in the ornate hallway. He is heading ''out in the country'' for a fund-raiser later in the day, so he is wearing a white polo shirt and cowboy boots embroidered with the Texas flag.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry, a 50-year-old Republican, is also wearing something that might surprise quite a few people in Texas political circles: the calm demeanor of a man seemingly without worries despite good reason to have a few. He is not actually up for election this November, but his political future is hip-locked to the presidential fortunes of Gov. George W. Bush. If Mr. Bush wins, Mr. Perry will become governor and a likely front-runner in the 2002 gubernatorial election; a Bush defeat would leave him in that corner office with the prospects of a far tougher race in 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry expresses complete confidence that Mr. Bush will win but in any case claims to lose no sleep dwelling on what happens if he doesn't. ''I don't pay a lot of attention to the 'what ifs,' '' he said, an outlook that places him in a tiny minority in Austin.</p>
        <p>But no matter what happens on Election Day, Mr. Perry will emerge as one of the most powerful figures in Texas, either as a new governor with a friend in the White House or as a powerful lieutenant governor with a lame-duck governor, since Mr. Bush has said he will not run again anyway. So, as Mr. Bush campaigns across the nation, Mr. Perry is in the midst of a different sort of campaign, quietly introducing himself to a Texas public that barely knows his name.</p>
        <p>''How have things changed for me?'' he said. ''The spotlight is a heck of a lot brighter.''</p>
        <p>Only last month, a poll found that nearly 75 percent of Texans could not name their lieutenant governor. The poll underscored an oddity of Texas politics. Because the lieutenant governor presides over the Senate, he is often considered the most powerful figure in state government. And yet whoever holds the job is virtually  unknown.</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Perry has raised his political profile, though not always as intended. He technically runs the state during Mr. Bush's frequent absences, which means he has presided over executions, offered disaster relief after tornadoes hit Fort Worth and, most of all, kept the government running smoothly. He has also provided political help for Mr. Bush at key moments, offering public support when the governor was being pilloried for the execution of Gary Graham or when cost overruns were discovered in the state budget.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Perry has also had his stumbles. Earlier this year he was widely criticized for a heavy-handed fund-raising letter that asked lobbyists to pledge their own contributions, as well as contributions of up to $25,000 from each of their clients, to his campaign war chest.</p>
        <p>And in June he was caught on videotape stepping out of his car and trying to persuade a state trooper not to ticket his driver for speeding. ''Why don't you just let us get on down the road?'' Mr. Perry asked the trooper, who issued a warning. Mr. Perry later said he regretted leaving the car but denied that he had been trying to pressure the officer.</p>
        <p>The missteps have brought criticism that his political edges remain rough. A profile in the October issue of Texas Monthly magazine characterized him as likable and sophisticated yet arrogant and ''not ready for prime time.''</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. Perry should not be underestimated.</p>
        <p>Raised on a West Texas ranch in the tiny community of Paint Creek, he served as an Air Force pilot and worked as a rancher before winning a seat as a Democrat in the state's House of Representatives in 1985. He served three terms, switched to the Republican Party and then became Texas agriculture commissioner in an upset of the Democratic incumbent, Jim Hightower.</p>
        <p>When Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, one of the state's legendary politicians, retired in 1998, Mr. Perry won a razor-thin victory to succeed him, with the help of a $1 million loan from one of the state's leading social conservatives in the campaign's final week.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Perry assumed leadership of the Senate, no one was certain what to expect. Mr. Bullock had ruled by fear and his innate knowledge of the Texas political system. Once known as a partisan, Mr. Perry instead cast himself as a conciliator, setting a bipartisan tone that earned him the respect of legislators and lobbyists. ''He's watched, he's observed, and he's moved slowly and carefully,'' said Bill Miller, a political strategist who works for both parties.</p>
        <p>Should Mr. Bush win in November, Mr. Perry promises, there will be few changes in governing philosophy here in Austin. He does say he will focus attention on higher education (Mr. Bush has concentrated on K through 12) and on improving state highways. And, in a year when capital punishment in Texas has come under heavy outside criticism, he rules out a moratorium on executions but suggests that lawmakers will address ''a number of issues'' including DNA testing and ensuring that indigent defendants receive competent legal counsel.</p>
        <p>Of course, any discussion of a Perry administration could be premature, particularly if Mr. Bush loses in November. The conventional political wisdom in Texas is that another Republican, the popular Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, will stay in Washington if Mr. Bush wins. But she is said to be considering a run for governor in 2002 if he loses. Politicians agree that she would be a formidable opponent for Mr. Perry in a Republican primary, possibly even a favorite. Mr. Perry calls her ''my friend'' and none too subtly counsels that she remain in Washington, in the best interests of the state.</p>
        <p>One thing is certain: Mr. Bush is far from the only person in Texas with his future on the line this Nov. 7.</p>
