        <p>In what is seen as a significant victory for animal rights advocates, a federal court ruled yesterday that the most commonly used laboratory animals -- mice, rats and birds -- will have to be given care under the relatively stringent rules of the Federal Animal Welfare Act.</p>
        <p>Until now, the act was interpreted by the government as applying to large animals like dogs, cats and monkeys, but not to the most commonly used research animals. Animal rights groups sued the Agriculture Department last year to expand the welfare act to the smaller animals.</p>

        <p>In what is seen as a significant victory for animal rights advocates, a federal court ruled yesterday that the most commonly used laboratory animals -- mice, rats and birds -- will have to be given care under the relatively stringent rules of the Federal Animal Welfare Act.</p>
        <p>Until now, the act was interpreted by the government as applying to large animals like dogs, cats and monkeys, but not to the most commonly used research animals. Animal rights groups sued the Agriculture Department last year to expand the welfare act to the smaller animals.</p>
        <p>Johns Hopkins University, which receives the most federal  research dollars of any university, opposed the lawsuit on the grounds that putting mice under the welfare act would increase costs and severely disrupt research.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the Agriculture Department must bring the small animals under the law.</p>
        <p>Under the ruling, the department will write regulations for the care of mice, rats and birds, which will then be subject to public comment before being adopted. The procedure can take one to three years.</p>
        <p>Andrew Solomon, a spokesman for Agriculture Secretary Dan  Glickman, said yesterday that the department would try to write rules that carried out the law but hindered medical research as little as possible.</p>
        <p>Late yesterday in Congress, House and Senate conferees were  considering amending the agriculture appropriations bill to prevent the department from proceeding in the coming year with a rule to include mice. That would at least stall the rule, if not kill it.</p>
        <p>The main advocacy group that won in court, the Alternatives Research and Development Foundation, an affiliate of the American Anti-Vivisection Society, contended that the ruling would not force mainstream biomedical researchers to make many changes, because most already operate under standards of animal care that the society finds acceptable.</p>
        <p>But some advocates for scientific research have argued against the rule change, saying that tougher standards could lead to much higher costs of operating laboratories, more paperwork and in the long run a burden that could reduce the number of experiments.</p>
        <p>After the ruling was issued, Dennis O'Shea, communications director for Johns Hopkins, estimated that compliance could cost the university millions of dollars a year.</p>
        <p>It has been estimated that 23 million mice are used in ongoing research at perhaps 4,000 institutions. But there is no precise count because the Animal Welfare Act had not included mice, rats and birds used in research.</p>
        <p>The act, enacted in 1966 and enforced by Agriculture Department inspectors, requires institutions to register if they use animals covered by the law, and to follow guidelines for their feeding, care and pain relief, as well as to submit to an annual inspection. About 1,900 sites are now registered.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 12, 2000, Thursday  An article on Saturday about an Agriculture Department agreement to bring laboratory mice, rats and birds under the care of the Federal Animal Welfare Act misstated the nature of a decision by Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. The judge decided that Johns Hopkins University could not intervene to stop the agreement, thereby allowing it to go forward; she did not rule on the substance of the agreement itself. Later developments are reported today on Page A16.</p>
