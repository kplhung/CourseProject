      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Madeleine Albright, first as representative to United Nations and then as secretary of state, never wavered in her conviction that Slobodan Milosevic was dictator and aggressor and that only his departure from power would assure triumph of peace and democracy in Southeastern Europe; says recent events have vindicated her persistence, and Pres Clinton's willingness to follow her instincts</p>

        <p>Washington tried out a succession of policies toward Slobodan Milosevic during his 13 years in power, courting him, cajoling him and finally opposing him with air strikes and economic sanctions. But Madeleine Albright, first as the representative to the United Nations and then as secretary of state, never wavered in her conviction that Mr. Milosevic was a dictator and aggressor and that only his departure from power would assure the triumph of peace and democracy in Southeastern Europe. Her own background as a refugee from tyranny in Czechoslovakia taught her that such men could not be appeased but must be opposed forthrightly. The events of the past few days in Yugoslavia have vindicated her persistence, and President Clinton's willingness to follow her instincts.</p>
        <p>Now Dr. Albright must show the same steadfastness on one of the most important remaining issues involving Mr. Milosevic -- delivering him to the international tribunal at The Hague to face charges of war crimes in Kosovo. In recent days, Dr. Albright has been unusually quiet in her public comments about Mr. Milosevic's extradition.</p>

        <p>Washington tried out a succession of policies toward Slobodan Milosevic during his 13 years in power, courting him, cajoling him and finally opposing him with air strikes and economic sanctions. But Madeleine Albright, first as the representative to the United Nations and then as secretary of state, never wavered in her conviction that Mr. Milosevic was a dictator and aggressor and that only his departure from power would assure the triumph of peace and democracy in Southeastern Europe. Her own background as a refugee from tyranny in Czechoslovakia taught her that such men could not be appeased but must be opposed forthrightly. The events of the past few days in Yugoslavia have vindicated her persistence, and President Clinton's willingness to follow her instincts.</p>
        <p>Now Dr. Albright must show the same steadfastness on one of the most important remaining issues involving Mr. Milosevic -- delivering him to the international tribunal at The Hague to face charges of war crimes in Kosovo. In recent days, Dr. Albright has been unusually quiet in her public comments about Mr. Milosevic's extradition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic belatedly conceded defeat yesterday. But he remains in Yugoslavia, and President-elect Vojislav Kostunica has said he opposes sending him to The Hague. But if Mr. Kostunica means to return Yugoslavia to the rule of law and its rightful place in European affairs, he should accept the authority of the Hague tribunal and the United Nations resolutions establishing it. With Mr. Kostunica's accession to the presidency now seemingly assured, there is no reason to mute Washington's insistence on respect for international justice.</p>
        <p>From her U.N. job, Dr. Albright was one of the administration's strongest advocates of military action to halt Bosnian Serb attacks against Muslim civilians and the Sarajevo government. Later, as secretary of state, she rightly insisted that Belgrade's brutal repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo could not be ignored or tolerated.</p>
        <p>During the long, difficult weeks of the NATO air campaign last year, the conflict was sometimes mockingly labeled ''Madeleine's war'' by her critics. But the 78-day NATO bombing campaign drove Serbian forces from Kosovo. She then led efforts to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic through economic sanctions while also working to unite Yugoslav opposition parties and press for free elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic's demise completes the European democratic revolution in which Dr. Albright wisely placed her faith. His trial at The Hague would reinforce the principle of rule of law on which that democratic revolution was based.</p>
