        <p>An animated, emotional, fast-talking Michael Strahan finally responded today to the criticisms made by the Giants' defensive line coach. Or as close as he would get.</p>
        <p>Strahan, a defensive end, spoke to reporters at his locker but would not discuss Denny Marcin's remarks this week that the team's defensive line no longer intimidated opponents and had lost respect around the league.</p>
        <p>Strahan, who maintained that he did not read the accounts of Marcin's statements, refused to speak about himself; he responded to an inquiry about his physical well-being by saying, ''The Atlanta Falcons look great.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not talking about myself,'' a testy Strahan said. ''I'm a team player. I'm not Michael Strahan Superman. I'm Michael Strahan, New York Giants team player. You want to ask me about the Atlanta Falcons, fine. But don't ask me about myself. I'm not talking about that.''</p>
        <p>His most intriguing response may have come when he was asked about facing Dan Reeves, the former Giants coach who is now the coach in  Atlanta, where the Giants will play on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''Any time he plays against us, I'm sure Dan Reeves wants to stick it to us,'' Strahan said.</p>
        <p>Strahan has had a stormy relationship with the news media since last year, when he said his criticisms of Coach Jim Fassel were misrepresented in print. Earlier this season he confronted a reporter for implying that he was ducking questions about his diminishing sack total.</p>
        <p>But given a chance to respond to Marcin's comments this week, Strahan declined. He then asked reporters not to say he was upset or frustrated. ''I'm not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Strahan, a three-time Pro Bowl player, became the highest-paid Giant last year when he signed a four-year, $32 million contract after recording 14 sacks in 1997 and 15 in 1998. He had five and a half last season.</p>
        <p>He has two and a half sacks so far this year, and his 16 tackles rank him 10th on the team. Strahan's drop in sacks is a major reason the defensive line is not the feared unit it was two seasons ago. And Fassel has said repeatedly since training camp that the Giants need to apply more pressure.</p>
        <p>Marcin was careful not to single out any player, saying that the entire unit was not giving a good enough second effort in rushing the quarterback. He also shot down the notion that double-teaming had kept the Giants' sack totals down, noting that offensive lines do not need to double-team because the Giants cannot beat one-on-one matchups.</p>
        <p>The line has five sacks this season; tackle Keith Hamilton has the other two and a half sacks.</p>
        <p>Marcin also said that he and Strahan had spoken privately about Strahan's frustrations.</p>
        <p>''I think he's definitely disappointed with what he's doing,'' Marcin said Wednesday. ''I think he'd tell you that.''</p>
        <p>Strahan today declined to reveal what he and Marcin discussed but said he was not the only player disappointed by the remarks.</p>
        <p>''We all are disappointed and frustrated at the whole team for not playing well the last two weeks,'' Strahan said. ''If you go ask another coach, he's disappointed in his group, so you guys picked a group and you made a big deal out of it.''</p>
        <p>Strahan should feast on the Falcons, whose line includes two rookies who start opposite Strahan.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach JIM FASSEL said he would decide on Sunday whether middle linebacker MIKE BARROW (pinched nerve in his neck) would play, although Barrow has not practiced and is unlikely to be active. PETE MONTY, a fourth-year player who replaced Barrow last Sunday at Tennessee, will probably start. Receiver AMANI TOOMER (sprained toe) returned to practice and will play. The Giants planned to put kicker BRAD DALUISO (stiff back) on the inactive list Friday night. Fassel also held off on deciding whether cornerback ANDREW WEATHERS would play until Sunday. Weathers, once projected as the nickel back, has not been active since tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a game last November. He returned to full practice Friday.</p>
