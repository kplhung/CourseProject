        <p>Three thousand miles from where John Franco was staring at potential ruin to a baseball season, from a distance so much safer to make the call, Joe Gambuzza talked to the television as if it had ears and the ability to pull the string on Barry Bonds.</p>
        <p>''Throw the changeup, not the fastball,'' Gambuzza pleaded. ''Throw the changeup. Throw your pitch.''</p>
        <p>He also made this suggestion to his wife, with the understanding that she was in no position to shake off Mike Piazza, with the count 3-2, the tying run on first and the San Francisco Giants down to their last out.</p>
        <p>Oh, Gambuzza was reminded about his union of 13 years with Dorothy Gambuzza. It happened to be the direct result of a blind date arranged by none other than Johnny Franco, his erstwhile prize pupil more than two decades earlier at Lafayette High in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Franco's wife, Rose, was pregnant with their daughter, Nicole, Gambuzza recalled. The four of them went out for Italian food, and he and Franco made a side deal. If Gambuzza tugged on his ear, that meant he was less than infatuated, and they all might want to skip the cannoli.</p>
        <p>''That's a whole other story,'' Gambuzza said yesterday from the dean's office at Lafayette. The school sits on the edge of the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, separated by the elevated train tracks from the Marlboro Houses, where Franco, son of a New York City garbage man, grew up.</p>
        <p>Back to a more conventional sign, the fastball Piazza was calling for, as Bonds batted in the home 10th inning Thursday night, the Giants trailing, 5-4, after shocking the Mets in the ninth with J. T. Snow's three-run, game-tying homer off Armando Benitez.</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine had moved to avoid the mistake that Dusty Baker had already made, sticking too long with a power relief pitcher following the ego-shattering experience of surrendering the game-altering long ball. Suddenly, for the climax of a night on which the Mets' postseason desperately hung, here came Franco, defrocked closer, to save them.</p>
        <p>It was pure baseball theater, filled with tension, laced with irony and embellished by the kind of endgame confrontation Franco had relished for so many years before Benitez took his job.</p>
        <p>Not a year ago, when it was obvious to almost everyone that Benitez was a force that could not be held back, Franco had contemplated going elsewhere to continue a run on the career saves record of 478 held by Lee Smith. Franco at the time had 416, but was not about to catch up, not here, if he pitched until he was 50.</p>
        <p>His mantra was: ''I didn't lose my job because of performance. I lost it because of injury.'' But his old coach had to tell him the truth, trying to convince him that Benitez was the new sheriff at Shea.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'John, even if I was the coach, I'd do the same thing,' '' Gambuzza said. ''I said: 'Benitez is younger. He throws harder. You're better off going to some other team, out west, where they don't know you.' ''</p>
        <p>That was the whole point of staying, though. Here, people knew him, all over his native Brooklyn and his adopted home in Staten Island. Here, he could be with his kids and see his brother, Jimmy, and pitch for a team, his hometown team, that sniffed the World Series last fall.</p>
        <p>Franco told Gambuzza one night that he had decided to stay and, not only that, he wasn't conceding anything to Benitez, either.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'I'm going to get a shot' -- blah, blah, blah,' '' Gambuzza said.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, Benitez was given the closer's job and made himself at home in it. Franco finished this season with four saves in five opportunities. He never publicly complained about being a setup man, but people like Gambuzza knew what he was thinking because, otherwise, he wouldn't be Franco.</p>
        <p>''The same way he was when I first got him at Lafayette, when he was 13, 14 years old,'' Gambuzza said. ''And you know what? When he stops thinking like that, then it's time for him to get out.''</p>
        <p>Gambuzza, 56, quit coaching last year at Lafayette after 22 years, and will give up teaching next year. Nobody lasts forever, not even Franco.</p>
        <p>The pitcher turned 40 recently, an occasion marked by a surprise party at a trendy TriBeCa nightspot. The guests ranged from Junior of the ''Sopranos'' cast to Franco's old friends from the projects. Gambuzza looked around, amazed. How great it would be, he thought, if Franco could be rewarded for his sacrifice with the World Series.</p>
        <p>With no contract for next year, he could very well be elsewhere, but in Game 2, Franco had the ball and the season in his left hand. ''Throw the changeup,'' Gambuzza kept saying, knowing one thing. Franco sure as heck wasn't afraid.</p>
        <p>Finally, he threw the 3-2 pitch, his pitch, the changeup in on the hands, freezing Bonds, for a borderline called strike. The Mets were going home for today's third game, even in the series. Benitez would again be the closer, but for the moment, Franco was jumping for joy, and three thousand miles east, Joe Gambuzza remembered what Franco had said last winter.</p>
        <p>He would get his shot, and he was right.</p>
