        <p>If the Jets beat the Pittsburgh Steelers at Giants Stadium on Sunday to go 5-0, they are, historically speaking, virtually assured of going to the playoffs. In the past decade, 14 clubs opened at 5-0 -- 13 of those teams earned playoff berths, 11 won division titles, 7 reached the Super Bowl and 5 won it all.</p>
        <p>Last year's Super Bowl champions, the St. Louis Rams (who are already 5-0 and have a bye this week), began at 5-0. But the Jets will face three division opponents after Pittsburgh, and the American Football Conference East is the only division with two teams that have already won four games (the Jets and the Miami Dolphins, who are 4-1). Teams in the division have won 10 of 14 games against nondivision opponents this year.</p>

        <p>If the Jets beat the Pittsburgh Steelers at Giants Stadium on Sunday to go 5-0, they are, historically speaking, virtually assured of going to the playoffs. In the past decade, 14 clubs opened at 5-0 -- 13 of those teams earned playoff berths, 11 won division titles, 7 reached the Super Bowl and 5 won it all.</p>
        <p>Last year's Super Bowl champions, the St. Louis Rams (who are already 5-0 and have a bye this week), began at 5-0. But the Jets will face three division opponents after Pittsburgh, and the American Football Conference East is the only division with two teams that have already won four games (the Jets and the Miami Dolphins, who are 4-1). Teams in the division have won 10 of 14 games against nondivision opponents this year.</p>
        <p>Seeing the Light</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh finally explained what inspired him to rustle up dozens of flashlights, slap Jets stickers on them and pass them out to players at a meeting earlier this week. The flashlights now stand in most lockers, a constant reminder that, while Keyshawn Johnson may be gone, his words can still inspire the Jets.</p>
        <p>Groh claimed, though, that the flashlights were not distributed as any kind of statement about Johnson, but rather about the kind of mind-set he hopes to instill in the Jets. Groh went around the room and had each position group turn on their flashlights until, at the end, the darkened room was filled with light.</p>
        <p>''I've spoken that what's important is not for us to have the most speed, or the most size, or the most power or the most running game, but that we're trying to have the most team,'' Groh said. ''The best players don't always make the best team -- by the best players I mean the most talented players -- but the best team always wins. Any single flashlight in a darkened room is not enough to illuminate the room. A few more illuminate the room somewhat, but probably not bright enough to get the job done. When all the lights are turned on at the same time, there was plenty of light to operate. As long as we all have the lights on, we're in business. If the concept doesn't hold up for 12 to 15 weeks, then it was just a cute little exercise.''</p>
        <p>Mum on Injuries</p>
        <p>Al Groh believes in C.I.A.-level secrecy when it comes to discussing injuries, so he would not elaborate on the condition of nose tackle Jason Ferguson. Ferguson sprained his left ankle early in the game against Tampa Bay two weeks ago and is listed as doubtful for Sunday. He did not practice Thursday and did only very limited work today. Groh said he would trust Ferguson, as he trusted Wayne Chrebet when he was hurt before a game earlier this season, to tell him the truth about how well he could play.</p>
        <p>''We're still in the hopeful stage,'' Groh said. ''My idea is not whether or not he can play in the game. It's whether or not he can play well.''</p>
        <p>Groh discusses personnel moves with the same concern for secrecy, and so he said he had an idea about whether the rookie Laveranues Coles or Vincent Brisby would be the third  receiver, but was unwilling to share his thinking. Brisby was inactive against Tampa Bay because of a groin injury, and Coles took advantage of his opportunity, making two catches for 34 yards and also catching the 2-point conversion that brought the Jets to within 3 points in their comeback. Brisby, who was brought in to challenge Dedric Ward as the second receiver, has instead disappeared, with only four receptions in his first three games.</p>
        <p>Call a Plumber?</p>
        <p>Al Groh did not seem terribly concerned about the offense's inconsistency. Groh said: ''Unless you're the St. Louis Rams, who nobody seems to be able to stop at any point, you look at everybody's offensive game, it generally comes in spurts. The faucet doesn't go on and stay on.''</p>
        <p>Like Father, Like Son</p>
        <p>There will be more than one Aaron Glenn on the field Sunday. Glenn's son, Aaron II, 6, will play in a flag football game at halftime. Glenn's son, who wears No. 31, like his dad, is a running back and a safety. The team is organized by Mike Kensil, the Jets' director of operations. Ray Mickens's daughter, Kamray, 5, is a cheerleader for the team.</p>
