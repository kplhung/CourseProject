        <p>The civility was short-lived. At two rallies today celebrating Dick Cheney's performance in a debate with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman that was variously described as gentlemanly, mannerly and downright friendly, Republicans unleashed some of their strongest assaults yet on Vice President Al Gore's credibility.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said that Mr. Gore's contention that his tax proposal helps working families is ''hogwash,'' accused his campaign of ''double talk'' on the state of the military and said that Mr. Gore ''seems to have a compulsion to embellish.''</p>

        <p>The civility was short-lived. At two rallies today celebrating Dick Cheney's performance in a debate with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman that was variously described as gentlemanly, mannerly and downright friendly, Republicans unleashed some of their strongest assaults yet on Vice President Al Gore's credibility.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said that Mr. Gore's contention that his tax proposal helps working families is ''hogwash,'' accused his campaign of ''double talk'' on the state of the military and said that Mr. Gore ''seems to have a compulsion to embellish.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne, was cheered when she told rallies here and in Shreveport, La., that she planned to send Mr. Gore an autographed copy of her book ''Telling the Truth.''</p>
        <p>And former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, who campaigned with Mr. Cheney today, charged that Mr. Gore's decision to break with his party and support the resolution in favor of the gulf war -- which the vice president cites as an example of his independence of mind and principled approach to governing -- was motivated not by patriotism but by a desire to get publicity. Mr. Simpson called Mr. Gore the ''provocative prevaricator of our times.''</p>
        <p>''That's a big word,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''There's a better word for it. But I can't use it here.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign said the charges were groundless. ''Dick Cheney is back on the attack because they lost the debate on the issues,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore campaign spokesman. ''When the facts are inconvenient for the Bush campaign, they resort to these kinds of attacks.''</p>
        <p>From the first event in the morning, Mr. Cheney, Mrs. Cheney and Mr. Simpson -- who was Wyoming's senator when Mr. Cheney was the state's lone congressman -- assailed Mr. Gore's credibility and character.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson leveled what might be the most damaging charge: that in 1991 Mr. Gore had sold his vote supporting the gulf war to get more time on television. Mr. Simpson charged -- as former Senator Bob Dole did in the 1992 election -- that Mr. Gore negotiated with both Democrats and Republicans to see who would give him more speaking time in the debate on the floor of the Senate before casting his vote. ''He had simply decided to support the side that gave him the most time at prime time,'' Mr. Simpson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hattaway denied the charge. ''Al Gore broke with his own party and voted to support the gulf war because it was the right thing to do,'' he said. ''Simpson's claim is absolutely false and obviously politically motivated.'' Appropriating a line that the Bush campaign uses against Mr. Gore, Mr. Hattaway said, ''Bush's supporters will obviously say anything to get him elected.''</p>
