        <p>The summer came and went with few confirmed sightings, but there was no mistaking it at City Hall this week. The combative, finger-pointing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was back, as the erstwhile gentler, friendlier mayor reasserted a style he had set aside last spring after his diagnosis of prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>For two days now, Mr. Giuliani has given impassioned monologues featuring oversized charts and characterizations like ''absurd'' and ''outrageous.'' At issue is a report by federal investigators saying they had found evidence of racial profiling by the Police Department's Street Crime Unit.</p>
        <p>The city's crackdown on crime is the centerpiece of Mr. Giuliani's administration, the single act that has earned him an international reputation as a no-nonsense, can-do mayor. And the federal inquiry, to the mayor, represented a frontal attack that demanded a full-throttle retaliation.</p>
        <p>Yes, Mr. Giuliani said, the police stop and frisk black and Hispanic men at a rate that far exceeds their share of the city population. The mayor deems this strategy justified because blacks and Hispanics are more frequently identified by victims as suspects, and he said that abandoning it would quickly translate into a surge in murders, rapes and robberies.</p>
        <p>''We will fight this case anywhere,'' the former prosecutor announced Thursday, volunteering to take on the case himself if necessary. ''We will take it to the Supreme Court of the United States, and we will prove it to any reasonable people who aren't prejudiced.''</p>
        <p>These are familiar refrains from a mayor who has rarely backed down when his convictions have told him that he is right, even when those stands have left him isolated. Consider his attacks on Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed black man killed by police in March after a brawl outside a Midtown bar.</p>
        <p>But as in some of these scuffles, several people, including some of his traditional allies, said this week that Mr. Giuliani's anger might be blurring his vision. Here is an opportunity, they said, for him to live up to his vow last spring to reach out to the disaffected.</p>
        <p>''Any time you are particularly proud of something, you are going to be aggressively defensive if people are critical,'' said Richard E. Green, the chief executive of the Crown Heights Youth Collective and a black Giuliani appointee to two police-related committees. ''But if there is a way we could address the problem, then that is what we need to focus our energies on.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's heated statements have been parsed by various black and Latino officials this week in a way indicating that he could be reopening deep wounds among the minority residents he had alienated with his emphatic defense of the Police Department.</p>
        <p>''The inflammatory rhetoric does nothing to address a very real problem in New York City,'' said John Melia, the press secretary to Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president and probable candidate for mayor next year.</p>
        <p>The mayor this week did acknowledge for the first time that the department's system of handling complaints of brutality and misconduct needed to be revamped, a concession that came in response to a separate federal investigation into the Police Department. But he flatly rejected allegations that the police unfairly target blacks and Hispanics.</p>
        <p>Officials from the United States attorney's office, which is conducting the investigation, would not comment on their inquiry, which began after the shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999. But the findings disclosed so far echo a December 1999 report by the state attorney general's office.</p>
        <p>When examining 175,000 records detailing incidents in 1998 and 1999 in which people were stopped and frisked by the police, state investigators found that blacks and Hispanics were stopped at a rate far greater than the frequency at which they were arrested. Their tendency to live in high-crime neighborhoods did not explain their more frequent stops, the report said.</p>
        <p>The review also found that fewer than a third of the stops and frisks had occurred because the police were looking for a particular suspect, countering the mayor's assertion that the high rate at which blacks and Hispanics were stopped was justified by the rate that they were identified as suspects.</p>
        <p>''Nothing the mayor has said in the past two days has in any way changed the analysis we did last year,'' Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Several black civic leaders and elected officials said this week that they were not advocating that the city back down from its assault on crime. Instead, they want more training and supervision of police officers, more recruitment of minority officers and better use of data collected by the department so it can determine, precinct by precinct, when and where police are treating blacks and Hispanics unfairly.</p>
        <p>''If you are criticizing the police force for doing its job, it is absurd and it is ridiculous,'' said Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, who has generally been reserved in his criticism of Mr. Giuliani. ''Police are supposed to catch criminals; that is what they are out there to do.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''But I have been out there, and I have been to many community meetings, and I have seen people who are not guilty of any crime who are complaining about being stopped, and that is wrong.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's response has also evoked criticism from national civil rights lawyers, who expressed appreciation for the growing recognition of the racial-profiling problem elsewhere in the country.</p>
        <p>Nationally, 23 of the nation's top 50 cities, including Miami, San Diego, Philadelphia, Seattle and Houston, have either begun or are planning programs to combat excessive roadway stops and street interrogations of blacks and Hispanics, said John M. Crew, national coordinator of the American Civil Liberties Union's Campaign Against Racial Profiling.</p>
        <p>''Trying to explain away or make excuses in the face of compelling statistical evidence is no longer an acceptable response,'' Mr. Crew said, noting that New York is not on his list.</p>
        <p>Even the language the mayor used this week in making his case has evoked complaints. On Thursday, he said that the police, when looking for one rapist described as black, might stop 100 men, 30 to 40 of whom would be arrested on unrelated charges.</p>
        <p>''It is classic Giuliani,'' said C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, who is black. She said the mayor's statement implied that he assumes that 30 percent to 40 percent of black men are criminals.</p>
        <p>But while Ms. Fields demanded an apology yesterday, the mayor showed no sign of backing down.</p>
        <p>''I am not going to apologize for it,'' the mayor said. ''Otherwise, I would have to lie to people, and I did not become mayor of New York City to engage in lies.''</p>
