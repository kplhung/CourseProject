        <p>British Telecommunications, which has been facing mounting criticism as its debt balloons, said today that its finance director was stepping down.</p>
        <p>The departure of the executive, Robert Brace, comes amid shareholder calls for a management shake-up. But a British Telecommunications spokeswoman said Mr. Brace's decision to leave the company after 11 years had been planned for some time and was unrelated to the company's financial situation.</p>
        <p>She also denied recent reports in the British press that the company's chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, would be stepping down.</p>
        <p>Still, shares of British Telecommunications, which have traded near an annual low, surged 7.7 percent, to 740 pence, or $10.70, in London today.</p>
        <p>The company's debt is expected to balloon to $:30 billion, or $44 billion, by the end of next year, or nearly triple March levels. Over the last year and a half, its debt rating has fallen six rungs.</p>
        <p>''A year ago, B.T. had one of the strongest balance sheets among European telecom operators,'' said Subhajit Gupta, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's in London. ''Today, it's at the bottom end of the group.''</p>
        <p>Like other telecommunications companies in Europe, British Telecommunications has been spending heavily to acquire third-generation mobile phone licenses and upgrade its network. Mr. Gupta estimates that over the next two years, the company will spend $25 billion on these new services alone.</p>
        <p>Yet unlike its competitors, British Telecommunications has been slow to spin off fast-growing units to foot the bill. The company is expected to conclude a lengthy strategic review by the end of the year. A likely outcome could be an offering of shares in its mobile-phone unit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brace will be replaced by Philip Hampton, 47, group finance director at BG Group, the utility holding company.</p>
