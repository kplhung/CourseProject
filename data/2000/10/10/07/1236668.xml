        <p>New Jersey education officials revealed yesterday that nearly two-fifths of public school fourth graders failed the state's standardized writing test in 1999 and 2000, even after the results were adjusted.</p>
        <p>Initial failure rates on the so-called language arts literacy portion of the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment were so high that testing experts concluded that the test must have been too difficult.</p>
        <p>As a result, the state announced earlier this week that it was lowering the passing grade. Officials would not say what the original failure rates were.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, David C. Hespe, the state education commissioner, said that the adjusted failure rates, or rates at which students were rated ''partially proficient,'' were 38.9 percent for 2000 and 37.3 for 1999.</p>
        <p>The results incorporated an adjustment in the way the state scored the test that increased the number of students who passed by 2.5 percentage points for 2000 and 2 points for 1999.</p>
        <p>The Education Department said that in November it would send local school districts the answers each of their students gave to one of two writing problems on the 2000 test, along with sample responses against which the students were scored.</p>
        <p>Michael Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said the information would be helpful. ''Now teachers will be able to find out exactly where the student needs help,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Results on this test have no effect on whether a student is promoted to fifth grade. The test is intended to measure districts' progress in teaching the state's so-called Core Curriculum Standards, adopted in 1996 to raise overall education standards.</p>
        <p>The announcement last month that the scores had been low drew a collective sigh from local districts, where officials thought the results would be unfairly viewed as a reflection of their own failure to teach the new curriculum. ''That's one of the big public relations problems with raising standards,'' Mr. Yaple said. ''It's not that kids suddenly became illiterate in the past two years.''</p>
