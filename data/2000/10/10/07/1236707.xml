        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation today that requires the state to provide New Yorkers with extensive information about malpractice judgments and disciplinary actions against doctors practicing in the state.</p>
        <p>The new law requires the New York State Department of Health to post such information on the Internet and to make it available through a toll-free telephone number.</p>
        <p>The law, which goes into effect immediately, places New York among a handful of states that provide extensive information to the public about the practice histories of doctors, along with information about hospitals and health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>The state already maintains a Web site listing the names of doctors against whom disciplinary action has been taken. But the site does not provide as much information as the new law requires, and since it is poorly publicized, it is little used.</p>
        <p>In approving the legislation today, Mr. Pataki hailed it as a victory for New York consumers, adding that they had a right to basic information about their health care providers, given the enormous stakes that may be involved.</p>
        <p>''When patients and families are making life and death decisions about health care and about which doctor will be entrusted with their care, they need as much information as possible to make an educated, comforting decision,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The new law requires the Department of Health to post a wealth of new information about health care providers on its Web site. The site will include relatively basic facts like doctors' education, hospital affiliations and professional awards. It will also provide consumers with fairly serious information, primarily a doctor's malpractice history and hospital dismissals that stem from harm to patients.</p>
        <p>The measure also requires the state health commissioner to draft a notice informing patients about the Web site, as well as the 800 number that people may call to gather similar listings. The state will mandate that doctors and hospitals post such notices.</p>
        <p>The bill had been strongly supported by Democrats in the Assembly early in the year, but then it foundered in the Republican-led Senate. It gained momentum in the summer only after the state charged several doctors and hospitals with egregious negligence.</p>
        <p>The bill's prospects of passage were also aided by an order to all 50 states by President Clinton to improve the reporting of medical errors. The president's decree followed a report that 44,000 to 98,000 hospital patients per year die because of medical mistakes.</p>
        <p>The bill was strongly opposed by doctors, but received support by a rare coalition of insurance companies and consumer groups. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield placed several full-page newspaper advertisements in favor of the bill, and patients' rights groups, often led by people harmed by doctors with records of malpractice, brought their case directly to the State Legislature in Albany.</p>
        <p>The measure, known as the Health Information and Quality Improvement Bill, would also require the state to develop other quality-assurance measures for the public, including regularly published hospital report cards and data about the outcomes of various procedures, like the state's current statistics on heart surgery survival rates.</p>
