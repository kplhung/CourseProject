        <p>There is no future for small farmers in New York State. Everybody knows that.</p>
        <p>The whipsaw of eternally rising costs and permanently depressed prices. The endless hours. The oops-there-goes-your-whole-crop weather patterns. Anybody who can is getting out, and the only ones left are the corporate mega-farms, the weekend hobbyists and those folks in so deep they can't leave the table.</p>
        <p>But there was the bus, parked in Frank Bialas Jr.'s driveway on Celery Avenue in the heart of Orange County's black-dirt country. And when its doors opened two Saturdays ago, the visitors from the city spilled out and practically ran into his fields, palming the tomatoes, marveling at his 17-year-old Pixall One-Row Bean Harvester, and asking question after question about profit margins and pesticides and crop succession. And no matter how discouraging his answers -- ''The reason the land's so cheap is that it's not really a good business'' was a typical one -- they would not be daunted.</p>
        <p>So who were these misguided souls? Farmers, with several centuries of experience among them. A cattleman from the Dominican Republic who cleans office buildings in Manhattan. A Colombian agronomist who ran a government rice mill and is now a waiter in Queens. A cane farmer from Ecuador turned salad chef, a Peruvian agriculture teacher turned crossing guard, and an organic farming expert and a livestock veterinarian from Colombia, both of whom fled the civil war this year and are now construction workers. All of them determined to get back to the land.</p>
        <p>The field trip was organized by another bunch of city slickers, the people who run New York City's beloved Greenmarkets. For them, the loss of farmland in the New York counties that serve the Greenmarkets (down 23 percent since 1978)  means lost opportunities to expand.</p>
        <p>There are 29 Greenmarkets around the city, said Tony Mannetta, the director of Greenmarket, which runs farmers' markets through the Council on the Environment of New York City, a privately financed nonprofit organization in the mayor's office.  But there could be a lot more if there were enough farmers to supply them.</p>
        <p>''We are nowhere near satisfying the number of communities that have asked for markets,'' Mr. Mannetta said. ''And looking forward 10 years from now, we realized that we don't see enough people going into farming.''</p>
        <p>But the effort to preserve farms doesn't mean just preventing pretty fields of moo cows from giving way to tract houses. In New York, Mr. Mannetta said, ''We've placed a lot of emphasis on land preservation, but there hasn't been much attention paid to preservation of the human resource.''</p>
        <p>So this summer, Greenmarket and the state agriculture department went headhunting. They reached out to the city's Spanish-speaking residents for experienced farmers looking to become not field hands, but managers, herdsmen and maybe even owners.</p>
        <p>They were not prepared for the response. El Diario, the city's leading Spanish daily newspaper, put an article on its front page on Aug. 8. The next day, said Rachel Dannefer, at that time the New Farmer Development Project's staff of one, ''there were 50 voice mail messages when I got in. When I took the phones off hold, it was three calls a minute and it didn't stop for days. It was overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>In a week, more than 500 calls came in. More than 200 people attended a hastily assembled series of workshops. And at 7 a.m. on a cold, drizzly Saturday, 37 people -- mostly men, but a few women -- showed up at the Greenmarket in Union Square for the bus tour of farms in Orange County, 75 miles northwest of New York City.</p>
        <p>Some said that they had wanted to migrate back to the countryside for years but had no idea where to begin.</p>
        <p>''I never thought I'd be able to go back to farming,'' said Jose Lliguichuscha, 55, a cook at an Italian restaurant who immigrated from Ecuador 31 years ago.</p>
        <p>The Greenmarket project, modeled after similar programs in Massachusetts, Louisiana and Washington State, acts as a bilingual liaison to county extension agents, real estate brokers, farmers who are looking for skilled workers, and loan officers. It offers marketing advice and, ultimately, a market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lliguichuscha said he was tired after decades of working in restaurants around the city. But isn't farming hard work, too?</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' he said, ''but I love it.''</p>
        <p>At the Greenmarket, the once and future farmers paid a quick visit to Morse Pitts's stall. They oohed at his pristine sunflower shoots and dandelion greens and aahed at the $8 a pound he was getting for them, but he told them what to expect in profits if they followed him into organic farming.</p>
        <p>''The first seven years, nothing,'' he said. ''Last year, something.''</p>
        <p>As the bus rolled up Route 17 and Bergen County, N.J., mall sprawl gave way to gentle hills and open fields at once hauntingly familiar and dauntingly strange, some travelers said they felt they needed to apprentice themselves to a farmer.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any problems with the names of the vegetables,'' said Jose Canas, who left El Salvador as a teenager rather than take sides in its civil war. He now manages a screwdriver factory on Long Island and moonlights as a clerk in a fancy produce store. ''But the land is different, the climate is different. What are the chemicals? When do you need them? What are the measurements? It's not going to be like one day I'm here and the next day I move up there.''</p>
        <p>The first stop was Mr. Pitts's Windfall Farms in Montgomery. The farm manager, Hector Gonzalez, himself a Mexican immigrant, led them through the narrow-rowed fields and the sprout trailer and explained the labor-intensive process of cultivating delicate greens: they go from seed to harvest in only a couple of weeks and must all be picked and washed by hand.</p>
        <p>He also seemed to love his job, which was good news to Jose Gutierrez, the salad chef. ''I've always heard that the farmers here exploit immigrants very badly,'' Mr. Gutierrez said, ''but now we see that this isn't always true.''</p>
        <p>While many immigrants in the New York area were frightened by the recent beatings of two Mexican workers on Long Island, both Mr. Pitts and Mr. Bialas said they doubted that immigrant farm owners would have trouble being accepted into the farming community.</p>
        <p>''Farmers are the friendliest, most generous people you've ever met,'' said Mr. Bialas, whose family's farm roots in Orange County go back 60 years. ''Everybody helps out everybody. A broker doesn't care who they buy from if the crop is good and it's a good price.''</p>
        <p>Some of the newcomers showed that they still had a lot to learn about the local flora. ''Ah, grapes,'' Guillermo Rivas, the Dominican cattleman, said as he passed a vine growing on the border of a field and popped a few into his mouth. His eyes widened and he spat out the sour fruit. ''Wild grapes,'' he corrected himself.</p>
        <p>The entourage stopped for lunch at the county vegetable research lab. Over sandwiches and chips, a man from the State Labor Department explained that for those who did not have work authorization yet (the prospects are a mix of authorized workers, illegal immigrants, asylum applicants and citizens), getting a visa to do skilled farm work could prove tricky.</p>
        <p>An associate director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Theresa Brown, said by telephone later that while the government issues visas for unskilled field workers and for workers whose jobs require a bachelor's degree -- a program that was expanded this week -- there were few visas for workers whose jobs fell between those categories.</p>
        <p>But there was welcome news, too. Neal  Needleman, an official from the Orange County office of the federal Farm Service Agency, told them that loans of up to $200,000 were available for people with a business plan and agricultural education or experience.</p>
        <p>Nestor Tello raised his finger. ''Does banana farming count?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>It did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Needleman said that, in fact, a prospective farmer could go into business with as little as $3,000 to $5,000.</p>
        <p>Of course, he added, there are some conditions: farmers should be willing to start out renting land and equipment rather than buying it, capable of building their own houses and selling high-priced organic produce directly in the Greenmarket, and able to somehow hang on while working soil must be pesticide-free for three years in order to be certified as organic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bialas, 57, who takes a dim view of organic farming in any case, found even this highly qualified chain of events preposterous.</p>
        <p>''I really don't think there'll be any success at all in them becoming farm owners,'' he said flatly. ''I saw second-, third-, fourth-generation farms, guys that knew the business, going broke because of market conditions, weather conditions, overextending themselves. They'll make more money working on a farm.''</p>
        <p>His daughter, Kasha, 29, was slightly more encouraging. She explained that she had to charge the same 60 cents a pound for carrots that she charged 10 years ago. In response, Ms. Dannefer of Greenmarket asked, ''Well, do you think these guys should become farmers or should they just give up?''</p>
        <p>''Well,'' Ms. Bialas said, ''I do it. You work hard, you have dirty hands for many months, and in the winter my brother and I have to take other jobs. You have to love it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tello, 39, a large-animal veterinarian from Colombia who works as a technician in a cat and dog hospital in Park Slope, said he was ready to sink his $5,000 nest egg into a little sliver of paradise and move his wife and son out of Brooklyn tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''We will build a small house,'' he said. ''I am a professional. I know organic farming techniques. The money does not bother me because being in the country is more important to me.</p>
        <p>''I am confident that this is possible.''</p>
