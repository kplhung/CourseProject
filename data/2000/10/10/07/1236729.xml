        <p>The most powerful earthquake in five years struck western Japan today, injuring more than 100 people, damaging many buildings and disrupting electricity and train service to the region.</p>
        <p>The epicenter of the quake, with a magnitude of 7.3, was in western Tottori prefecture, 360 miles west of here. In Sakaiminato, the closest city to the epicenter, at least six houses were destroyed in the 10-second quake at 1:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>''I've never experienced such a strong quake in my life,'' a woman in a nearby town, Yonago, told the NTV television network. ''I run a beauty parlor, and I grabbed a customer and held onto her. And we both crouched to the floor.''</p>
        <p>Live television coverage from the NHK network showed workers in its newsroom in Matsue clutching their desks as the quake threw things to the floor. A hanging lamp was swinging violently as people appeared to run for cover.</p>
        <p>Japan is in one of the most seismically active areas in the world, where several tectonic plates are coming together, causing frequent earthquakes and tremors.</p>
        <p>Public safety experts took comfort that there were no reports of casualties or catastrophic damage to major office buildings. Some commentators attributed the lack of casualties to the quake's being centered on relatively sparsely inhabited countryside. At least 10 landslides were reported in mountains around the quake zone.</p>
        <p>The quake did cause at least one tunnel to collapse and cut off road and rail access to many areas.</p>
        <p>Two nuclear power plants in the region were reportedly unaffected. They had been shut for maintenance.</p>
        <p>Many people reacted nervously to the news after a summer of unusually intense seismic activity, including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Reflecting the nervousness, Japanese stock markets swiftly declined.</p>
        <p>The most recent devastating quake in Japan was in Kobe, the port city southwest of Tokyo, where a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in 1995 killed 6,425 people and destroyed 250,000 houses.</p>
