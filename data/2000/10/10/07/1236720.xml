        <p>Frank Rich Op-Ed column says first presidential debate added zero to public's knowledge of either Al Gore or George W Bush; says Bush, who is fond of boasting that he is man of principle, not 'polling and focus groups,' was just as scripted as his opponent; expects most voters to skip next two exchanges of rehearsed sound bites between candidates, no matter how much they are hyped as 'make or break'; drawings (M)</p>

        <p>It would be ''make or break.'' It would be Kennedy-Nixon. Bush might drool. Gore might explode. At MSNBC, the breathless anchor predicted an audience ''as high as 90 million'' -- 10 million more than the record set by Reagan-Carter in '80. Democracy in action, baby!</p>
        <p>Well, that was Tuesday. By Wednesday it was clear that there hasn't been this much hype for a flop show since the Olympics. The first great debate didn't make or break anything except the viewer's patience. No Bush malapropisms. No over-the-top Gore attacks. No eloquence. Not only was this no Kennedy-Nixon, it wasn't even Bentsen-Quayle. And the audience? A mere 46 million, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's prediction, echoed everywhere, including The Times, was off by 50 percent.</p>

        <p>Well, that was Tuesday. By Wednesday it was clear that there hasn't been this much hype for a flop show since the Olympics. The first great debate didn't make or break anything except the viewer's patience. No Bush malapropisms. No over-the-top Gore attacks. No eloquence. Not only was this no Kennedy-Nixon, it wasn't even Bentsen-Quayle. And the audience? A mere 46 million, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's prediction, echoed everywhere, including The Times, was off by 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Still, I wouldn't have missed the debate for anything. Though it added exactly zero to our knowledge of either Al Gore or George W. Bush, it is a keeper for any time capsule of America 2000. At a cultural moment when many voters are forced constantly to make that hard choice between the Gap and Banana Republic, what is more apt than the spectacle of two princely boomers in identical outfits hypothesizing about how to spend a surplus of infinitely elastic trillions that both assume will last indefinitely? Now that branding and marketing are the national ideology -- and focus groups have a clout unmatched by labor unions or the religious right -- what could be more fitting than a debate in which not a single word is uttered that hasn't been pre-tested more rigorously than a McDonald's breakfast sandwich rollout?</p>
        <p>There was almost a Platonic perfection to the event's complete insulation from even the possibility of spontaneity, let alone the rude intrusion of present-day reality. You could watch all 90 minutes -- I'm not sure too many did -- and never know of bloodshed in the Middle East, or of a drug war run amok, or of an America populated by anyone other than the elderly and schoolchildren. The only comic relief was not Mr. Bush's lame jokes (by the same hand that wrote his wisecrack about David Letterman's open-heart surgery?) but both candidates' response to Jim Lehrer's question of how they might respond to an economic crisis. These are men who have never known bad times; neither had an answer. In this sense, too, the debate encapsulated a boom in which hardship is for many forgetful Americans only a theoretical possibility.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Bush is fond of boasting that he's a man of principle, not ''polling and focus groups,'' he was just as scripted as his opponent -- no small feat. Mr. Gore's hit parade of tested buzz words and phrases -- ''middle class'' (10 mentions), ''wealthiest  1 percent'' (10), ''lockbox'' (7) -- was nearly matched by Mr. Bush's Pavlovian references to bringing ''Republicans and Democrats'' together (9) and ''fuzzy'' math (4). There were five times when the governor tried to prove his credentials as a leader by telling us what governors do, as in the ''governor is the chief executive officer and learns how to set agendas,'' and ''governors are oftentimes found on the front line of catastrophic situations.'' While Mr. Bush may spare us Mr. Gore's insufferable, schoolmarmish tone, his ''affable'' alternative is to speak to us as if we've all been held back together with him in grade school.</p>
        <p>Even more revealing was what polling and focus groups told the two men not to say. Mr. Bush won't use the word ''vouchers'' (though he's in favor of them) or ''impeachment'' (though he was presumably in favor of that too). In a real debate, surely the Texas governor would bring up the signature issue of his party for the past four years, and Mr. Gore's contemporaneous contention that Bill Clinton ''will be regarded in the history books as one of our greatest presidents.'' But no. Polling says that any criticism of an opponent will be perceived by Oprah-fied women as a ''personal attack,'' so even Mr. Bush's mention of the Buddhist temple arrived tentatively, late in the game.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is just as cautious. The Texas governor presents himself as a guardian of education and health care, but if you turn to his own campaign's official Web site, you'll find that his so-called rebuttals of embarrassing facts about his Texas -- 48th in per-capita spending for public health and 41st in per-capita spending on public education, first in uninsured children -- rely on fuzzy, often bogus comparisons and irrelevant math. But like the Clinton presidency, Mr. Bush's Texas record is off-limits because polling shows that an attack on an opponent's public record is now also considered ''personal.''</p>
        <p>Since both men are so straitjacketed by self-censorship, how could the debate have possibly advanced the story line? It's the bland leading the bland. No wonder that the soporific vice-presidential sequel was widely overpraised by contrast -- the guys at least sounded like free-speaking human beings. (And give Dick Cheney bonus points for being the only man on either ticket not to wear a red tie and white shirt.) No wonder, too, that young voters ignore debates, skip elections and seek out an alternative culture where people say what they mean. A steady diet of Bush-Gore could drive anyone to Eminem.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Dan Rather -- who alone among TV heavies had the guts to pronounce the presidential face-off ''pedantic, dull, unimaginative, lackluster, humdrum, you pick the word'' -- the bloviators were as rigid in analyzing the debate as its combatants were in waging it. They focused on the twin plot lines that had been hyped in advance -- would Gore be too mean? would Bush commit a gaffe? -- and adjudicated the ''winner'' accordingly. (Since neither man committed the predicted sins, the verdicts were vague and divided.) Much as some at first missed the significance of Rick Lazio's paper-wielding stunt in his debate with Hillary Clinton, male pundits may have underrated the one moment in the Bush-Gore debate that might actually have moved some of those undecided suburban swing-state women voters said to hold the Electoral College's key.</p>
        <p>The moment came when Mr. Bush told a Gore-like whopper, fudging his previous stand in favor of trying to thwart the F.D.A.'s approval of RU-486, the abortion pill. Planned Parenthood polling shows that undecided Republican and independent women in states like Florida, Michigan and Missouri are disproportionately pro-choice and disproportionately likely to choose a candidate on that issue -- but that many of them don't yet know that Mr. Bush is both anti-choice and (despite his professed desire to make abortion ''more rare'') hostile to family planning. The Bush campaign has no doubt seen similar polling, as evidenced not only by its man's evasive debate answer but also by his decision a week earlier to announce his initial stand against RU-486 by press release rather than on camera.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, there was no discernible movement -- nor could there be. Mr. Bush remains a conventional anti-tax, small-government Republican with the hard-right edges sanded down; Mr. Gore remains a conventional Democratic believer in governmental activism, though with any traces of leftist grandiosity muted into earth tones. G.O.P.-lite, Democrat-lite: For the 95 percent of the country unwilling to go for Ralph Nader or Pat Buchanan, that is the choice, it always has been the choice, and it will still be the choice on Nov. 7. Dueling prescription-drug plans -- both likely to be folded into a compromise by a divided Congress anyway -- hardly alter the equation. And if character counts most, that, too, isn't changing. Mr. Bush is still an entitled, hail-fellow-well-met American blueblood who has coasted through life with the right name and its attendant connections. Mr. Gore is still the overcalculating child of the expediencies of Washington, where no principle is written in stone for longer than a polling cycle.</p>
        <p>The only hope for a real shake-up in this tale is a true October surprise that can't be greeted with pre-fab language -- perhaps a shocking F.B.I. resolution to the question of who mailed a Bush debate preparation tape to the Gore camp. (Please say it wasn't Wen Ho Lee.) Short of that, much of the audience will skip the next two exchanges of rehearsed sound bites between the candidates, no matter how much they are hyped as ''make or break.'' There's no need to settle for reruns now that there's a new season of ''The West Wing.''</p>
