        <p>A school bus matron was on duty, along with the driver, in a van where the police say two Brooklyn boys sexually abused a younger schoolmate, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The three boys, all students at Public School 231, a school for special education students in Borough Park, were on the way home on Tuesday when the incident occurred, said Sgt. James Foley, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education will not conduct its own investigation into the incident, said a spokeswoman, Margie Feinberg, who described the boys as ''severely handicapped.''</p>
        <p>''It's an emotionally disturbed group of children who are on this bus,'' she said. ''We are taking it very seriously.''</p>
        <p>The assault began when the bus, a minivan that a Board of Education official said usually seats 14 students, was near East 78th Street and Flatlands Avenue, the police said.</p>
        <p>Two boys, 8 and 9, forced the younger boy, 7, to perform a sexual act in the back of the van, the police said.</p>
        <p>The 7-year-old told his mother about the incident and she reported it to the police on Thursday. The 9-year-old and the 8-year-old were arrested and charged with sodomy, the police said.</p>
        <p>The matron and the driver of the  van were transferred to another route pending a police investigation, officials said yesterday. The employees, whose names were not released, work for 21st Avenue Transportation, a company that has a contract with the Board of Education, a board official said.</p>
        <p>A dispatcher from the bus company, Vincent LaMonica, declined to comment on the incident yesterday.</p>
        <p>But a driver for another bus company, who declined to give his name, said such an assault could not have taken place without the knowledge of a bus matron.</p>
        <p>''The only way this could possibly happen would be if the matron wasn't on the bus,'' said the man, who has been driving buses in Brooklyn for 20 years. Sitting behind the wheel of his own minivan as he waited for his charges yesterday, the driver said, ''People think we're idiots behind here, but we have to be parents, doctors, psychologists, police officers all rolled into one.''</p>
