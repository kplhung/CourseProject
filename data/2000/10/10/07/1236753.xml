        <p>When the pinch-hitter Carlos Guillen of the Mariners shocked everyone by squaring around to bunt in the bottom of the ninth inning today, he pushed the ball past pitcher Keith Foulke, first baseman Frank Thomas and second baseman Ray Durham of the White Sox.</p>
        <p>All three defenders spun and lunged in futility like plastic figures in a table-top hockey game who could not quite reach the puck.</p>
        <p>As the ball hit the infield grass and rolled over the dirt and into right field, Guillen's face broke into a grin while he danced down the first-base line. Behind him, the pinch-runner Rickey Henderson dashed from third to home with the winning run as the Mariners won, 2-1, at Safeco Field to sweep their American League division series in three games.</p>
        <p>The fans -- 48,010 of them, the largest crowd in the brief history of this delightful new stadium -- erupted in a sort of a shocked shout that grew into a joyous roar as the Mariners raced from their first-base dugout and mobbed Guillen.</p>
        <p>Before long, some of the players uncorked Champagne bottles and sprayed them on the giddy spectators.</p>
        <p>Next week the Mariners will face either the Yankees or the Oakland Athletics for the American League pennant. But that can wait. The Mariners celebrated loudly and at length today after a splendid climax to a so-so series. In an era filled with home-run inflation and long, tedious games, these two teams performed a neat little pitchers' duel filled with good fielding and managerial strategy over a pleasant and fast-paced 2 hours 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>And the winning play was really a bit of improvisation. Seattle Manager Lou Piniella had told Guillen to try to hit a grounder to first base because Thomas does not play there often and might not be able to throw out the speedy Henderson.</p>
        <p>So, on the first pitch, Guillen decided to try to hit a sacrifice fly. He fouled the pitch off. ''After that, I said, 'I'll try for a grounder to first base,' '' said Guillen, a utility infielder who spent time in the minor leagues this season.</p>
        <p>With four infielders pulled in, a bunt might seem like a low-percentage play. Did Guillen think the bunt surprised the White Sox? ''Yeah,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Mariners, the last of the eight qualifiers in baseball's postseason tournament, became the first team to reach the second of three rounds. They won the wild-card berth on the final day of the season. Now, they have a chance to rest and scout their next opponent. They are playing little ball, the kind usually found in the National League. They are winning with pitching, fielding and timely hitting from veteran players.</p>
        <p>Jerry Manuel, the Chicago manager, said Seattle's late quest for a playoff berth has given the Mariners momentum to go much farther.</p>
        <p>''They made it and came in and played a good level of baseball at the right time,'' Manuel said. ''They outhit us. They outplayed us. They outmanaged us.''</p>
        <p>Chicago finished the regular season with the best record in the American League, but limped into the postseason with injured pitchers and nervous hitters. James Baldwin, today's starter, worked despite cortisone shots to numb the pain of a damaged right shoulder. He pitched six innings and left with a 1-1 tie. The only Chicago run came after a second-inning double by Harold Baines, who moved to third on a fly ball to center and scored on another fly to the same place.</p>
        <p>The Mariners tied the score in the bottom of the fourth inning on a two-out ground ball by Stan Javier that hit the glove of Durham and bounced away. It could have been scored an error. Although Manuel shaved his beard and shuffled his lineup to change Chicago's luck, he got an 0-for-2 performance from Thomas, who finished the series 0 for 9. The Sox managed only three hits today.</p>
        <p>Seattle's winning pitcher was the reliever Jose Paniagua, but the star on the mound was Aaron Sele, the starter, who left with one out in the eighth. The Mariners bullpen gave up no runs in the series.</p>
        <p>''We've got something special going,'' Sele said. ''We mixed and matched all year long and played together. Today is a great example of our team play.''</p>
        <p>A key addition this season has been John Olerud, the veteran first baseman who played with the Mets from 1997 to 1999. He went 3 for 10 in this series, including a home run in the first game. Today, Olerud made three unassisted putouts, one of them a spear of a hard grounder by Chris Singleton.</p>
        <p>He started the ninth with a line drive off a 3-1 pitch into the midsection of pitcher Kelly Wunsch. The pitcher fielded the ball off the mound but threw hurriedly and awkwardly from one knee. The ball skipped past Thomas, allowing Olerud to take second. Henderson ran for Olerud and took third on a sacrifice bunt by Javier to set up the final moments.</p>
        <p>''This series, we played about as well as you could hope to play,'' Olerud said.</p>
