        <p>Hoping to be part of a wave of local laws that will force the State Legislature to act, Carteret has become the second community in New Jersey to ban the use of handheld cellular phones while driving.</p>
        <p>Mayor James A. Failace of Carteret broke a 3-3 deadlock of the Borough Council on Thursday night, voting for a ban modeled after one adopted by Marlboro, N.J., in July.</p>
        <p>''I think maybe to get the state to do this, it's got to be passed town by town,'' said Mr. Failace. ''I'm hoping that other municipalities jump on board.'' The mayor confessed that he  frequently used a car phone while driving, and would have to buy a headset.</p>
        <p>Following a 1997 Canadian study that found that cellular phone users were four times more likely than non-users to have accidents while driving, at least six municipalities in New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania have adopted a ban on the use of handheld cellular phones by motorists. One New York county -- Suffolk -- adopted a ban on Tuesday. More than half the states are considering doing the same, while outside the United States, 13 countries have such bans.</p>
        <p>A month after Marlboro adopted its ban, it was sued by one of the nation's largest cellular carriers, Sprint PCS of Kansas City, Mo. Sprint claimed that only a state government could regulate motor vehicles.</p>
        <p>The company dropped its suit last week, however, saying it would focus its efforts on the State Legislature. The State Senate has approved a committee to recommend ways to reduce driver distractions. The resolution, which does not need Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's signature,  awaits a hearing before the Assembly Transportation Committee.</p>
        <p>Chuck Leitgeb, a spokesman for the Assembly Republicans, who control the committee and have a majority in the Assembly, declined to comment on the likelihood of the measure's approval.</p>
        <p>The three votes against the Carteret ban were based on concerns similar to those expressed in Sprint's lawsuit against Marlboro, Mr. Failace said.</p>
        <p>In Jersey City, Mayor Bret Schundler vetoed the City Council's approval of a ban last month based on the same concerns, although council members are contemplating an override.</p>
        <p>Craig J. Coughlin, the borough attorney for Carteret, said the new ordinance could withstand a court challenge because it was based on a municipality's statutory authority over public safety.</p>
        <p>Sprint's position has not changed since it dropped its suit against Marlboro, and it has no plans to sue Carteret, said Larry McDonnell, a company spokesman.</p>
        <p>Michael Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, said that at least two dozen of the state's 566 municipalities inquired about the issue soon after Marlboro approved its ban, but the inquiries have trailed off. However, he said, interest is likely to be fueled by Carteret's action.</p>
