        <p>Pittsburgh is perhaps a victory away from entering the national college football polls and about half a season away from moving into a new stadium. With a few more players like Rod Rutherford and Antonio Bryant, the Panthers might be close to returning to the good old days when Tony Dorsett and Dan Marino siphoned some attention from the city's main sports attraction, the National Football League's Steelers.</p>
        <p>How close will be determined today when Pitt (4-0) travels to Syracuse, a perennial Big East contender. The Orangemen are off to a disappointing 2-2 start, but the Panthers have not won in the raucous Carrier Dome since 1982. In fact, they have not beaten the Orangemen in their last nine meetings.</p>

        <p>Pittsburgh is perhaps a victory away from entering the national college football polls and about half a season away from moving into a new stadium. With a few more players like Rod Rutherford and Antonio Bryant, the Panthers might be close to returning to the good old days when Tony Dorsett and Dan Marino siphoned some attention from the city's main sports attraction, the National Football League's Steelers.</p>
        <p>How close will be determined today when Pitt (4-0) travels to Syracuse, a perennial Big East contender. The Orangemen are off to a disappointing 2-2 start, but the Panthers have not won in the raucous Carrier Dome since 1982. In fact, they have not beaten the Orangemen in their last nine meetings.</p>
        <p>It is a game that could very well announce a new contender in a conference that has been dominated recently by three teams: Miami, Virginia Tech and Syracuse.</p>
        <p>''I look at it as an elite team in our league traditionally,'' Pitt Coach Walt Harris said of Syracuse, ''and a team that if we want to develop our football program this season we are going to have to find a way to win against them and win against the elite teams in our league.''</p>
        <p>In his fourth season, Harris has already beaten in-state rival Penn State this year and designed an explosive offensive unit. Pittsburgh is ranked No. 3 in the nation in passing efficiency. John Turman, the senior quarterback, is ranked No. 2 despite sharing time with the junior David Priestley and Rutherford, a redshirt freshman who also lines up at wide receiver and returns kicks.</p>
        <p>The Orangemen have given up 210.8 yards a game through the air, which makes them the second-worst passing defense in the conference, ahead of only Rutgers. Still, their 42-14 victory over Brigham Young last Saturday indicated that they might have figured out their weaknesses in time for the conference season.</p>
        <p>''We can definitely improve,'' Syracuse defensive end Dwight Freeney said. ''We haven't had our best game yet. There are a lot of things we can work on. We have to work on our pass-rushing lanes and keeping the blockers' hands off of us.''</p>
        <p>Syracuse also has to worry about Rutherford and Bryant, the sophomore wide receiver, both of whom are part of a new wave of talent for a program that was once rich in history but of late poor in facilities. Not anymore.</p>
        <p>The $30 million UPMC Sports Performance Complex, which the Panthers share with the Steelers, is open. It houses the university's Duratz Athletic Complex, which is outfitted with a state-of-the-art weight room, a dining room and offices for the coaching and academic support staff. There are two grass practice fields, as well as one indoors. Next season, they join the Steelers at a new 65,000-seat stadium in downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Before Harris arrived in 1997, the Panthers had won just five games in the previous five seasons. Harris led them to a 6-5 regular-season record that year and their first bowl berth since 1989. While Pitt was tumbling to a 2-9 record in 1998, Harris pounded the recruiting trail, selling the program's history as well as a wide-open offense he had refined during his years as an assistant coach, much of it specializing in quarterbacks.</p>
        <p>At Illinois from 1980 to 1982, he developed three future N.F.L. quarterbacks: Tony Eason, Dave Wilson and Jack Trudeau. And with the Jets from 1992 to 1994, he helped Boomer Esiason re-establish himself as one of the better quarterbacks in the league.</p>
        <p>Bryant, who is averaging 17.3 yards a catch and 115.3 yards a game, was barely recruited out of Miami; Rutherford was a Pennsylvania high school player of the year. Rutherford is the Panthers' version of the Steelers' Kordell Stewart: he has run the option at quarterback, caught a 62-yard touchdown pass against Penn State and returned four kicks for 124 yards in a victory over Rutgers two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>So far, the Panthers have the stingiest defense among Big East teams, giving up only 42.3 yards a game on the ground.</p>
        <p>The Panthers can wait a year for a new stadium but not to get back to a bowl.</p>
        <p>''The new facilities make a difference and are  helping us get over the hump,'' Harris said. ''But we still have to find those good players nobody knows about. We'll know better where we are two or three years down the road. But we're making some strides now.''</p>
