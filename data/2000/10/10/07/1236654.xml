        <p>Thailand's national utility plans to sell to the public this month 40 percent of a power plant that is the exclusive customer of a natural gas project in Myanmar connected to the Unocal Corporation.</p>
        <p>The natural gas project has been sharply criticized by human rights activists, who say that it helps finance an oppressive junta in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.</p>
        <p>Thailand first made plans for the gas-fired plant in Ratchaburi, west of Bangkok, in the early 1990's to help feed soaring power demand and in 1995 signed a 30-year agreement to buy natural gas from Myanmar to fuel it. But by the time the $1 billion pipeline was ready, Thailand was in the midst of the Asian financial crisis, power demand had plummeted, and the new plant was delayed. Thailand was stuck paying for gas it could not use and, some argue, does not need.</p>
        <p>Now, as part of its agreement with the World Bank for emergency financing during the crisis, Thailand is trying to privatize the plant and raise as much as 8.7 billion baht, or about $204 million.</p>
        <p>''It's altogether a failure,'' said Pipob Udomittipong, a member of the environmental group EarthRights International. ''It's a mismanagement of the energy policy in this country.''</p>
        <p>The Ratchaburi public offering is the business end of a wider controversy that stretches from the waters off Myanmar all the way to the United States Supreme Court. Ratchaburi buys its gas from two sources in Myanmar, the Yetagun consortium partly owned by Premier Oil of Britain and the Yadana consortium that includes Total Fina Elf of France and Unocal, which is based in El Segundo, Calif.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the projects say they help finance Myanmar's military rulers, who have clung to power despite losing an election in 1990 to the party of the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
        <p>Human rights activists have also taken aim at the projects' Western owners. They contend that when the companies built the pipeline to carry the gas from the ocean 60 kilometers across rebel-contested territory in Myanmar to the Thai border, the companies became knowing accessories to slave labor and other human rights abuses perpetrated by the troops securing the area.</p>
        <p>The companies have denied the allegations, with Unocal arguing that its pipeline investment has improved the lives of nearby residents and is an argument against the kind of sanctions the United States imposed in 1997 against any new investments in Myanmar.</p>
        <p>Last month, a federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed a lawsuit against Unocal filed on behalf of 15 Myanmar residents. The judge ruled that while Unocal was aware that the military was using forced labor it had not conspired with the regime. The plaintiffs plan to appeal.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a Massachusetts state law prohibiting companies that do business in Myanmar from obtaining state contracts.</p>
        <p>Human rights activists say the gas projects help Myanmar's ruling generals buy weapons to suppress scattered rebellion among the country's ethnic minorities and to prop up their brutal regime.</p>
        <p>The Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Company and its Thai underwriters have been careful to advertise the stock offering primarily to the Thai public, where Myanmar's human rights record has generated little controversy. Underwriters have not even prepared an English version of the company's prospectus, analysts said.</p>
        <p>But underwriters have reportedly set aside about half of the new shares for institutional investors like mutual funds, and brokers in Bangkok said there was nothing to stop foreigners from buying the shares, especially once they were listed on the stock exchange. Officials at SCB Securities, the lead underwriter, could not be reached for comment.</p>
