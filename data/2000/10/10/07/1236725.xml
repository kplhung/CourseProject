        <p>A British Columbia judge yesterday was not swayed by Marty McSorley's contention that he was simply trying to intimidate, not injure, Donald Brashear, and found McSorley guilty of assault with a weapon.</p>
        <p>Judge William Kitchen ruled that McSorley aimed for Brashear's head, not his shoulder, when he swung his stick at Brashear and knocked the Vancouver Canucks' wing to the ice, causing a severe concussion in the final seconds of a game with the Boston Bruins last Feb. 21. Kitchen said McSorley ''slashed for the head. A child, swinging as at a T-ball, would not miss. A housekeeper swinging a carpet-beater would not miss. An N.H.L. player would never, ever miss. Brashear was struck as intended.''</p>

        <p>A British Columbia judge yesterday was not swayed by Marty McSorley's contention that he was simply trying to intimidate, not injure, Donald Brashear, and found McSorley guilty of assault with a weapon.</p>
        <p>Judge William Kitchen ruled that McSorley aimed for Brashear's head, not his shoulder, when he swung his stick at Brashear and knocked the Vancouver Canucks' wing to the ice, causing a severe concussion in the final seconds of a game with the Boston Bruins last Feb. 21. Kitchen said McSorley ''slashed for the head. A child, swinging as at a T-ball, would not miss. A housekeeper swinging a carpet-beater would not miss. An N.H.L. player would never, ever miss. Brashear was struck as intended.''</p>
        <p>However, Kitchen declined to send McSorley to jail. McSorley, a notorious enforcer, was granted a conditional discharge, meaning no charges will go on his record as long as he completes 18 months of probation. McSorley was not fined, but he was ordered not to play against Brashear during that time. If McSorley, a free agent, were to play against Brashear in the United States, the Canadian court would consider that a probation violation.</p>
        <p>''I've played the game for a long time,'' McSorley told the judge. ''I have a tremendous amount of respect for the game.</p>
        <p>''I'm extremely glad to see Donald back on the ice and I do plan to address this with Donald in person.''</p>
        <p>McSorley received the largest fine and suspension in National Hockey League history: $72,000 and a ban of 23 games to close the season. McSorley, a defenseman, still must meet with N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman to determine whether he will be allowed to play again.</p>
        <p>''The court today said that its focus was solely on the charge against Mr. McSorley,'' Bettman said in a statement. ''This was not a trial of the game or the N.H.L.''</p>
        <p>The verdict was expected to be a major issue for the players association and its executive director, Bob Goodenow.</p>
        <p>''Judge Kitchen sent a clear message when he said 'having to live the stigma of the trial was punishment enough,' '' Goodenow said in a statement. ''I'm certain that, notwithstanding Marty's rights to consider an appeal, both individuals want to put the matter behind them and move forward.''</p>
        <p>''The court in Vancouver has made its decision and it's time to move on,'' Brashear told The Associated Press. The trial was the first for an on-ice attack by an N.H.L. player since Dino Ciccarelli, then with the Minnesota North Stars, was sentenced in 1988. He received a day in jail and a $1,000 fine for hitting Toronto's Luke Richardson with his stick.</p>
        <p>Bill Smart, McSorley's lawyer, argued that players give ''explicit consent'' to the risk of on-ice contact.  Bruins defenseman Kyle McLaren called the verdict ''shocking.''</p>
        <p>''It happens in games,'' McLaren said. ''It happens all the time. There's other stuff that's probably worse than that. The N.H.L. did a good job of policing itself. Now it's going off-ice. It's sort of crossing some bounds here.''</p>
