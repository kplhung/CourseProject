        <p>School officials shut down a middle school in Suffolk County yesterday after a loaded handgun, apparently left during a security training session, was discovered in the building on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>The gun, a .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson, as well as a small container of gunpowder and some books, were in a book bag that had previously been hidden by a security company in a hallway of William T. Rogers Middle School in Kings Park during a canine training session authorized by the school district, the police said.</p>
        <p>The book bag was found about 6:30 p.m. behind a fire extinguisher in the hallway.</p>
        <p>After an investigation, the police determined that the gun belonged to Michael Gould, an owner of Canine Consultants International, a private security firm that has a contract with the Kings Park School District. He is also an officer with the Nassau County police.</p>
        <p>It was unclear last night when the most recent training session took place. The police said the owners of the security business were helping them determine when that was.</p>
