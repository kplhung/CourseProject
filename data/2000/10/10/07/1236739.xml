        <p>Amid a laser light show, the sellout crowd roared with delight as the Stanley Cup stood at center ice.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, the Stanley Cup banner was raised to the rafters of the Continental Arena. But the loudest cheer on a night of celebration for the Devils was the resounding chant of ''We Want Arnott.''</p>
        <p>Jason Arnott, the unrestricted free agent who scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal in overtime against Dallas last spring, remains unsigned.</p>
        <p>And Scott Niedermayer, the team's leading point-scorer for the past five seasons, was also not on the ice for the Devils' 8-4 trouncing of the Montreal Canadiens in the season opener.</p>
        <p>For one night, at least, the Devils did not miss Arnott or Niedermayer as they remained undefeated in their last 10 home openers (8-0-2).</p>
        <p>They built a 2-0 lead on goals by Bobby Holik and Sergei Nemchinov in the first seven minutes, but Montreal's Brian Savage and the rookie Xavier Delisle countered and the first period ended deadlocked.</p>
        <p>The Devils scored three goals in a span of 3 minutes 18 seconds in the second period to put the game out of reach. Petr Sykora started the outburst 1:41 into the period and Alexander Mogliny and Colin White completed it before the period was five minutes old.</p>
        <p>Saku Koivu pulled the Canadiens to 5-3. But Mogilny scored his second of the night at 3:57 of the third and Turner Stevenson added a goal at 5:04 to bury the Canadiens, who missed the playoffs the last two seasons.</p>
        <p>Oleg Petrov added a goal for the Canadiens at 11:23 before Steve Kelly closed out the scoring for the Devils at 16:51.</p>
        <p>Tonight was a night to savor for former Devils owner John McMullen. The 82-year-old McMullen, who sold the team to YankeeNets, raised the banner with his family and Scott Stevens, the captain.</p>
        <p>''He's been like a father to me,'' said Ken Daneyko, the 18-year veteran defenseman.</p>
        <p>Stevens, who won the Conn Smythe trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, said, ''It's like an athlete in the Olympics winning a gold medal and they play the national anthem.''</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur, who was dominant against Dallas last spring and had 26 saves tonight, said the raising of the banner made the Devils' championship official.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to see the banner in your building hanging there forever -- unless we move into a new building,'' Brodeur said with a laugh, alluding to the possibility of the team moving to Newark. ''You can look at it and it will bring back memories.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur didn't have one of his better nights, but the Devils provided enough firepower for the victory.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of emotion and you always worry about wide-open games like this,'' Devils Coach Larry Robinson said. ''You tell the guys to focus, but it was so emotional I lost focus myself.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The Devils scratched forwards JIM McKENZIE and ED WARD, both newcomers, and defenseman SASCHA GOC. . . . The three quick goals early in the second period signaled the end for Montreal goalie JEFF HACKETT. He allowed five goals on 13 shots and was replaced by MATHIEU GARON.</p>
