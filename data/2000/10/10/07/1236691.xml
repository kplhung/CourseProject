        <p>In setting out their agendas, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are counting on nearly $4.6 trillion in projected federal budget surpluses. Given the zeal with which they are apportioning still-hypothetical money, it may be worth asking a few questions:</p>
        <p>Will the surplus materialize as predicted?</p>
        <p>If it does, how much of it will really be available for the types of new initiatives the candidates are proposing?</p>
        <p>And how long will it last?</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office tackled the last question in a study released today. It warned that although the fiscal outlook for the next decade or so is bright and getting brighter, the picture over the longer run remains troubled, even dire.</p>
        <p>The first two questions are entangled in a fierce debate. The government has run surpluses for the past several years, and there is nothing on the horizon to suggest that they will not continue. Indeed, all the evidence now indicates that the surplus projections will be increased next year because of the economy's continued strength.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it was only five years ago that deficits were assumed to be a permanent fixture of the economy.</p>
        <p>''Both campaigns are using the best forecasting techniques available,'' said Stanley Collender, managing director of the federal budget consulting group at Fleischman Hillard, the public relations firm. ''Having said that, those techniques have proven to be consistently and completely wrong.''</p>
        <p>Even if all the money comes in as expected, there are claims on it beyond those being made by the presidential candidates. The affordability of the plans offered by Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush will come into focus only as Congress and the next administration sort out their priorities.</p>
        <p>However much skepticism is warranted, the federal government has never confronted even the likelihood of such fiscal plenty.</p>
        <p>After decades in which both parties chafed under the restrictions imposed by budget deficits, it was inevitable that both would embrace the pot of gold placed before them by the strong economy.</p>
        <p>Yet it is remarkable in some ways that the two candidates have pledged to use a little more than half of it to pay down the national debt and shore up Social Security, two interrelated issues that have no immediate political payoff.</p>
        <p>''I would use somewhat less money than either candidate for tax cuts or spending,'' said Carol Cox Wait, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group advocating fiscal discipline. ''But for us budgeteers to get on a high horse and say they should be even more restrained ignores the way politics and campaigns work in this country.''</p>
        <p>In the study it released today, the Congressional Budget Office said that by using the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security -- nearly $2.4 trillion over the next decade -- to pay down the debt, the government would postpone its long-term fiscal problems but by no means eliminate them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has called for using nearly all of the Social Security surplus for debt reduction. Mr. Bush would use $1 trillion of it to help establish personal investment accounts within Social Security.</p>
        <p>Assuming that the entire Social Security surplus goes to debt reduction, the budget office found that the government would run surpluses until around 2020 and then would start running rapidly escalating deficits as the cost of paying Social Security and Medicare benefits to an aging population began to mount.</p>
        <p>By 2040, the budget office found, the rising deficits would have driven that part of the national debt held by the public back up to levels it has not reached since the years immediately after World War II. The situation will be far worse if the Social Security surplus is not put to debt reduction, the study said.</p>
        <p>''Saving most or all of the budget surpluses that C.B.O. projects over the next 10 years -- using them to pay down debt -- would have a positive impact on the projections and substantially delay the emergence of a serious fiscal imbalance,'' the study said.</p>
        <p>''Yet under most of the assumptions C.B.O. used, a fiscal imbalance eventually develops whether or not surpluses are realized,'' it said. ''If the nation's leaders do not change current policies to eliminate that imbalance, federal deficits are likely to reappear and eventually drive federal debt to unsustainable levels.''</p>
        <p>Even if the economy holds up and tax revenues keep flowing in as anticipated, there is a case to be made that much of the money has already been allocated.</p>
        <p>The surplus projections being used by the candidates -- those developed this summer by the Congressional Budget Office -- assume that government spending will grow at the rate of inflation. But the two parties in Congress and President Clinton are in the process of agreeing on spending increases this year that are far in excess of inflation.</p>
        <p>Alan J. Auerbach of the University of California and William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution concluded in a recent study that even if the budget office's $4.6 trillion, 10-year surplus projection was right, the two parties really had less than 10 percent of it to fight over during the next decade.</p>
        <p>The Social Security surplus of $2.4 trillion has already been taken off the table for tax cuts or spending. Of the remaining $2.2 trillion, $864 billion would be used up if Congress just held spending at its current level relative to gross domestic product, a reasonable assumption given what the two parties plan to spend this year, their study said.</p>
        <p>Another $360 billion would be set aside to meet a call from both parties to wall off excess Medicare revenues. Dealing with several bipartisan tax priorities would eat up another $155 billion. Once some other issues were dealt with, the remaining surplus would be only $352 billion over 10 years, they concluded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's tax and spending proposals come to $1.5 trillion. Mr. Bush's total $1.9 trillion.</p>
