        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Denial of genocide grows more serious as the last eyewitnesses die off. This is why we feel compelled to reply to the Sept. 30 letter writer who opposes the House resolution on the 1915 Armenian genocide with his dismissive statement that ''many thousands died in Anatolia, the majority being Muslim Turks.''</p>
        <p>The complicity of the Ottoman Turkish government in the systematic torture and murder of Armenian civilians was witnessed and documented by Henry Morgenthau Sr., our great-grandfather and the American ambassador to Turkey, as described in his book, ''Ambassador Morgenthau's Story.'' Rather than driving wedges, as the letter writer suggests that the House resolution might do, it could encourage Turkey to acknowledge and apologize for the acts of its predecessor government, as Germany has done.</p>
        <p>LUCY TUCHMAN EISENBERG  HENRY MORGENTHAU IV  Los Angeles, Oct. 1, 2000</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 14, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, an article last Saturday about a proposed measure in the House of Representatives condemning the mass killings of Armenians between 1915 and 1923, as part of an Ottoman campaign to force them out of eastern Turkey, misstated the death toll accepted by Armenians. It is more than a million, not thousands.</p>
