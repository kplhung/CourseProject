        <p>The two monitors overseeing the New Jersey State Police Department's effort to end racial profiling commended the force yesterday for its first steps toward that goal.</p>
        <p>It was the first report card from the independent monitors, who were appointed by a federal judge in March, nearly a year after the state admitted that troopers had singled out minority drivers for traffic stops.</p>
        <p>As part of an agreement with the federal Justice Department to stop the practice, the state is required to make 97 specific changes in policies, rules for traffic stops, the training and supervision of troopers and the handling of misconduct charges.</p>
        <p>In their report yesterday, the monitors said that state police officials had written new rules and regulations to effect 83 of those changes.  But the department has been slower in putting the new rules to work in  day-to-day operations, the report said. The monitors said that they had finished analyzing the use of 56  changes and found that the department was practicing 23 of them.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the report said, the department was not resisting change. ''While the agency is not in complete compliance, this is to be expected,'' said the monitors, James Ginger, a consultant from San Antonio, and Alberto Rivas, a lawyer from Newark.</p>
        <p>Rules for nine other required changes had not been prepared yet, and the department's progress in drafting the remaining five had not been analyzed, the report said.</p>
        <p>The monitors praised state police executives for the ''commitment, focus, energy and professionalism'' they had exhibited in starting work on the changes. If that positive attitude persists, the remaining tasks should be completed swiftly, the monitors said.</p>
        <p>''Rather than adopting the 'quick fix,' '' the report said, ''the agency appears intent on adopting the best available process, technology and system to conform to both the letter and spirit of the decree.''</p>
        <p>The state entered into the agreement, or consent decree, after the Justice Department conducted a three-year investigation of racial profiling and threatened to file suit against the state for failing to protect the rights of minority drivers.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials said at the time that the consent decree and outside monitoring of it would end the inattentive supervision, training and disciplinary practices that, they said, had allowed some troopers to single out black and Hispanic drivers with impunity.</p>
        <p>Some provisions of the consent decree specifically prohibit troopers from stopping a driver based on his  race, national origin or ethnicity, unless the troopers have reasonable suspicion that the driver fits the description of a suspect being sought.</p>
        <p>The report said the rules detailing this prohibition had been drafted, but the monitors said they had not yet checked whether troopers on patrol were complying.</p>
        <p>The report was submitted to Judge  Mary L. Cooper of United States District Court in Trenton, who is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the state police comply with the consent decree. It is the first of four reports that Dr. Ginger and Mr. Rivas must submit in the next year; after that, they are required to submit two a year. The monitoring is expected to last up to five years.</p>
        <p>Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said he was pleased with the pace of reforms. ''Much remains to be done,'' he said, ''but I believe this report is strong evidence of New Jersey's commitment to restoring the public's faith and confidence in the state police.''</p>
        <p>''I think the minority community -- I think all of New Jersey -- should be tremendously heartened by this report,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Many of the required changes that have not yet been made, or that have not yet been checked, involve major revisions in training programs and supervision of troopers on patrol.</p>
        <p>Although the consent decree set a 180-day deadline for adoption of new rules and procedures, the monitors said that the timetable was unrealistic. They said it would take 12 to 18 months to completely revamp policies and retrain all 2,700 troopers.</p>
        <p>Similarly, they said, it would take that much time to install a new computer system at state police headquarters. The system is to allow supervisors to carefully monitor the patrol activities of all troopers and keep centralized, up-to-the-minute records of arrests and stops.</p>
