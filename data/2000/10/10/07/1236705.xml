        <p>An 83-year-old Staten Island man died early yesterday, hours after his car collided with an unmarked police car that had been responding to a shooting, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police car, which was traveling with its lights and siren on, ran a stop sign, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Daniel Newman, died four hours after the collision, which took place about 10:45 p.m. on Thursday, said Officer Chris Cottingham, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The accident occurred as officers from the Staten Island Housing Unit were responding to a report of a man shot in front of 80 North Burgher Avenue, Officer Cottingham said. The two cars collided as Mr. Newman was driving west on Myrtle Avenue and the police car was headed north on Broadway, he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 12, 2000, Thursday  An article on Saturday about the death of Daniel Newman, whose car collided with an unmarked police car on Broadway in Staten Island, gave an incorrect cause from the police for the accident. The cause is still under investigation, but the police now say their car did not run a stop sign.</p>
