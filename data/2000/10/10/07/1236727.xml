        <p>Until Monsanto introduced a genetically altered cotton plant here in the buckle on the Chinese Cotton Belt three years ago, farmers like Ma Yuzhuo sprayed their fields with tons of organophosphate pesticides to kill bollworms, grubs that feed on immature cotton bolls.</p>
        <p>So toxic is the compound, which is similar to the basic ingredient of nerve gas, that many people die from exposure to it each year, though the government will not disclose the number of fatalities.</p>
        <p>But the Monsanto cotton plant, known by the brand name of its seed, Bollgard, carries a gene from a common family of bacteria called bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt. The Bt gene makes the plant produce a protein toxic to bollworms, reducing the need for spraying pesticides, raising yields and allowing Mr. Ma to survive. ''I don't understand it, but I know it works,'' he said, poring over his thigh-high plants for bollworms.</p>
        <p>Bioengineered crops are not grown much in Western Europe and have raised safety concerns in the United States. But China has embraced them, growing cotton and other crops faster than any other Asian nation.</p>
        <p>Saving lives is one motivation. But saving its farm economy is the chief concern. China hopes that genetics can save farmers like Mr. Ma from devastation by helping produce lower-cost high-quality products after it joins the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Chinese farmland is fragmented into tiny plots, each worked by several people, and the cost to grow a bushel of wheat, rice or corn is higher than in the United States or Europe. After China joins the W.T.O., a move that will wipe out many import restrictions on foreign agricultural products, the country's slender farm incomes will shrink even more than they already have from falling grain prices and rising expenses.</p>
        <p>China's rush to genetic crops is part of a broader effort to co-opt the new science as China's own before it is dominated by the West, as has occurred with other technologies. The initiative dates from the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative, which poured billions of dollars into high-technology research in the 80's with the goal of building a space-based missile-defense system.</p>
        <p>Startled by the prospect that America would forever dominate the planet because of its superior technology, Deng Xiaoping called for a Chinese response. A result was the 863 Project, so named because it started in March 1986.</p>
        <p>Beijing called in its top scientists from around the world and set them working on seven broad areas. Genetic engineering was at the top of the list. Since then, the double helix has replaced the atom as the symbol of the modernization drive.</p>
        <p>Laboratories around the country are aiming their gene guns at pig and goat cells in hopes of developing pharmaceutical proteins and transplantable organs for humans or injecting pollen grains with DNA to produce virus-resistant papayas, potatoes, tobacco and tomatoes. One man is working on cloning the fast-disappearing panda.</p>
        <p>Among the people summoned by Mr. Deng was Chen Zhanliang, who was working in a Monsanto-financed laboratory at the University of St. Louis. He was put in charge of developing transgenic plants other than cotton. In that process, scientists transplant genes into the recipient plant's DNA.</p>
        <p>''This is the biggest research grant in the history of Chinese molecular biology,'' Mr. Chen said.</p>
        <p>His panel gives money to more than 150 laboratories that are working on projects like drought-resistant rice and corn with high oil levels.</p>
        <p>China was the first in the world to grow genetically engineered crops commercially, starting with virus-resistant tobacco plants in northeastern Liaoning Province in 1988. Since 1997, Beijing has approved the release of more than 100 genetically altered crops, double the number released in the United States. Several, including slow-ripening tomatoes and virus-resistant green peppers, are in commercial production and have entered the food supply.</p>
        <p>''Quality improvement is the first focus, because when you get rich you get picky,'' Mr. Chen said, noting that not only does the Chinese diet now include more grain-fed meat, but increasingly sophisticated palates are also demanding better-tasting grain. ''More and more people like to eat rice that's a little sticky, for example, and that's something controlled by a gene.''</p>
        <p>Despite predictions in the mid-80's that the growing population would eventually overtake China's ability to feed itself, self-sufficiency is not much of a concern anymore. The country is sitting on mountains of surplus grain and can no longer buy all that its farmers grow. But because production costs are high and quality is poor, not much can be profitably exported. Much of it rots in temporary granaries.</p>
        <p>Inexpensive high-quality foreign grain, meanwhile, threatens to erode further the farmers' glutted home market. Though China is one of the biggest soybean growers, it buys American beans, because they are higher in protein and richer in oil than homegrown beans. Most imported soybeans are pressed for cooking oil and ground into feed for hogs and chickens destined for export or to satisfy the Chinese people's growing appetite for meat. To face competition from American meat, even more stockyards will need better grain for feed.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest gene-transplanting efforts focuses on rice, the world's most widely consumed grain. Rice is the first crop to be completely genetically decoded, thanks to Monsanto, which sponsored the work and made the results public. China is the No. 1 producer. But its methods are inefficient, and the quality of its rice is often poor.</p>
        <p>Chinese geneticists are identifying the functions of specific genes and will soon create rice with fewer stalks per plant, but twice as many kernels per stalk, for example, or rice that needs less water or rice with a higher protein content.</p>
        <p>''In less than 10 years, we'll be accessing technology from China,'' said John Killmer, vice president of Monsanto Far East Ltd. in Beijing.</p>
        <p>China is trying to make sure of that the lax protection of intellectual property rights and a selective approval process keep competitors in check while domestic companies have freer rein. Monsanto has been successful in introducing its bollworm-resistant cottonseed to central China's Hebei Province, for example. But it has been rejected in nearby Hubei Province.</p>
        <p>Although the company has recently received approval to sell the seed in Shandong Province, southeast of Hebei, its cotton variety is already planted on an estimated 33 million acres -- 80 percent of the genetically modified cotton in the province. But that is grown from pirated seed.</p>
        <p>Pirating is simple. Seed producers plant the cotton in isolated fields surrounded by buffer zones wide enough to ensure that cross-pollinating insects do not make it to the cotton. They harvest the seed, treat it and sell it under their brand name.</p>
        <p>Enthusiasm for the new science abounds. There is no public debate to stir up the opposition that has brought the development of genetically modified crops to a near standstill in India. Chinese scientists are derisive about Europe's resistance, which has already made China stop exporting genetically altered tobacco and soy sauce made from American genetically altered soybeans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen said tests over the last year had shown no significant differences in research that covers studies like the sperm count and the liver weight of rats fed modified foods against those on normal diets. Though with no independent news coverage and no labeling rules, consumers are unaware that they are eating modified food, in any case.</p>
        <p>Yet there is concern. While driving through the Hebei cotton country, a biologist from Monsanto, Nathan Lu, took a call on his mobile telephone from a worried official at the Agricultural Ministry who had heard that the bollworm was back in the Yellow River Basin. The ministry fears a super bollworm will develop that is resistant to the gene-altered cotton.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists in the United States, where genetically altered crops have proved extremely popular, are also concerned that Bt cotton could help speed the evolution of pests resistant to the Bt toxin, a widely used naturally produced insecticide popular with conventional and organic farmers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lu said the worm reappeared late in the growing season, because the cotton flower's pollen carries less of the poison protein than other parts of the plant. In normal years, the return of the worm is minimal, because Chinese farmers work the cotton plant by plant, snapping off the tops of the plants, where most bollworm eggs are laid. But the worm breeds more successfully in dry years, and a drought this year has led to a larger second wave.</p>
        <p>In Shahexin, Mr. Ma, the farmer, said even with the worms that have reappeared, he has not had to spray. Before the modified cotton arrived, he and his children sprayed their fields 20 to 30 times from May to September because the worm had grown so resistant to the pesticide.</p>
        <p>Standing beneath a figwort tree, he said his sons, weaker than he, suffered nausea and troubled breathing at least twice every year. They need expensive injections of antropine, the antidote that soldiers carried in the Persian Gulf war in case of nerve-gas attacks from Iraq.</p>
        <p>He said his yield had increased as much as 50 percent since he started planting the modified cotton. And, he said, by not buying pesticides he saves $80 an acre -- and his life.</p>
