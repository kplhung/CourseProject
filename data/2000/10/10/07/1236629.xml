        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your criticism of the Senate leadership for playing politics with the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act was greatly appreciated (editorial, Oct. 3). However, your characterization of the act as helping ''states and localities combat domestic violence'' is too narrow. Money provided under the act provides assistance to survivors of domestic abuse and other sexual violence as well.</p>

        <p>In New York City, these funds have supported my own group as well as counseling units in district attorneys' offices and programs in hospital emergency departments to provide specialized medical and forensic care to rape victims. It is important for the public to understand the full scope of the act and to voice support for its immediate reauthorization.</p>
