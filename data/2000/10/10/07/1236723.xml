        <p>A perfume shop on one of Belgrade's main shopping streets, Terazije, is called Scandal, and it is owned by Marko Milosevic, son of Slobodan.</p>
        <p>It was trashed and looted last night by some of the hundreds of thousands who thronged through Belgrade to take back their government from Mr. Milosevic and his family.</p>
        <p>Today, hundreds of people stared at the broken windows, as if transfixed by the fall of the first family, which ran what was called a ''conjugal dictatorship'' here -- even though dictatorships don't usually feel the need for electoral legitimacy, however manipulated, or manage to lose elections.</p>
        <p>Marko Milosevic is a particular object of hatred, for his children's park called Bambiland (named after a brand of cookie, not a deer) in the family hometown of Pozarevac, and for his reported black-market trading in gasoline, oil and cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Graffiti scrawled on the walls of Scandal read: ''Go complain to your daddy!'' Nearby was the slogan of the student movement Otpor, or Resistance: ''He's finished!''</p>
        <p>Another slogan read, ''Idi s'mirom,'' or ''Go in peace,'' a pun on the name of Marko Milosevic's mother, Mirjana Markovic, known as Mira.</p>
        <p>This was a day of revolutionary tourism, with Belgraders and some of those who had come from towns like Cacak to do the heavy lifting of this revolution -- the fighting and the storming and the burning -- taking a look at the wreckage left behind.</p>
        <p>Outside the burned Radio Television Serbia building -- a wing not touched by the NATO bombs during the war -- people talked softly, as if still unbelieving of what they had done, or what had been done in their name. There was a sense of accomplishment and pride, but sorrow, too, for the destruction. And there was anger, aimed at those who had worked inside, feeding propaganda, most of it crude, to a people who regard themselves as European and sophisticated.</p>
        <p>This building is a prime symbol of Mr. Milosevic's rule, and in March 1991, in violent demonstrations against his leadership, there was a march on it. People called it Television Bastille.</p>
        <p>''Those scum wouldn't get out before, so they had to do this,'' said Senja Djukovic, an economist. ''Milosevic always waits until it's too late, and so did they.''</p>
        <p>As she spoke, there was a scuffle and angry words. There was a tight circle around a news editor named Zika Nikolic, who was being shoved and spit upon. Others calmed the situation down, as a man said urgently to Mr. Nikolic: ''We didn't beat you, but you should be ashamed. Why do you stay here to irritate people?''</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, as the building was burning, the chief news editor, Milorad Komrakov, was kept under a kind of citizens' arrest in an office full of smoke. His angry guards were young men, most of them dressed in bulletproof jackets and helmets taken from the police. Finally, cooler heads prevailed, and the young men agreed to smuggle Mr. Komrakov out of the building, dressed in one of their jackets and helmets.</p>
        <p>Today the famous state-owned daily newspaper Politika, founded in 1904 and a fount of propaganda for years, came out with a special edition, prepared by those who had gone over to the opposition. The headline read: ''Vojislav Kostunica, Yugoslav President, Addressed the Nation: Serbia on the Road to Democracy.''</p>
        <p>The paper provided his entire speech to the enormous crowd that hailed him on Thursday night, and then described to readers ''our efforts to make a better, different, more objective and more informative Politika that will be devoted to the principles of professional ethics and truthful journalism.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Djukovic, the economist, was not alone in finding the sudden switch a little nauseating; others, like Zoran Doklic, said they had read the new Politika in tears.</p>
        <p>A journalist who preferred anonymity spoke contemptuously of the correspondents of Tanjug, the state news agency, who appeared on YU-Info, a television station associated with Mrs. Markovic's political party, describing world reaction. ''They said one thing yesterday, and today something completely different,'' the journalist said. ''It's disgusting.''</p>
        <p>The new, liberated state television keeps repeating that it is now open to all viewpoints. But this morning, the first of the new era, did not seem so changed. A presenter was taking telephone calls, and one caller was sarcastic, asking if this was state television. The presenter said, ''Yes, we're the new television.'' The caller asked: ''What happened to the old television? It burned down, huh?'' After a while, when the presenter finally realized that her caller was hostile, she quickly cut him off.</p>
        <p>In front of the burned-out Parliament building this morning, people walked by in awe. Guards kept people away, because the building was still smoldering. But a middle-aged man with a young boy in tow walked up the steps, past the firefighters, showing the boy what had happened and what it meant.</p>
        <p>There was ambivalence in the crowd about the destruction and the looting. Carpets were ripped and missing; furniture was stolen; documents were destroyed. The leather briefcases of legislators were taken as souvenirs; some were on sale today, in the crowd, for $50.</p>
        <p>''I suppose it's the price of our freedom, but it's very sad to see,'' Slobodan Petrovic said of the damage. ''And it will be very expensive to fix.''</p>
        <p>But there was also a sense that this revolution had come surprisingly cheap, at least in terms of the dead. Just two people died, one from a heart attack and the other after a fall. As many as 100 people were injured, but some of those simply suffered from too much tear gas.</p>
        <p>''In the end, it was cheap,'' said Zoran Gajic, 38, an engineer. ''We've done well. If you consider everything that happened, it's a small price. It's a small price compared with what we got.''</p>
