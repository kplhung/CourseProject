        <p>If the Tampa Bay Lightning is any barometer, the Islanders are an improved team from last season. That's how Islanders Coach Butch Goring sees it. A year after losing to the Lightning in their regular-season opener, the Islanders tonight opened their season with a 3-3 tie before 20,686, a record for the Ice Palace.</p>
        <p>''We're just a much more in-control hockey team,'' Goring said of his team featuring 12 new players. ''And we didn't make as many mistakes.''</p>

        <p>If the Tampa Bay Lightning is any barometer, the Islanders are an improved team from last season. That's how Islanders Coach Butch Goring sees it. A year after losing to the Lightning in their regular-season opener, the Islanders tonight opened their season with a 3-3 tie before 20,686, a record for the Ice Palace.</p>
        <p>''We're just a much more in-control hockey team,'' Goring said of his team featuring 12 new players. ''And we didn't make as many mistakes.''</p>
        <p>The opener had some good and not-so-good aspects for the Islanders to mull before their next game at Toronto on Tuesday. They were 0 for 8 on power plays, yet also held the Lightning to 24 shots over 65 minutes.</p>
        <p>''We had a lot of opportunities,'' Goring said of the power play. ''We were as good as we could be without scoring. We're going to find the net sooner or later.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders, who couldn't capitalize on a power play in the last 1 minute 23 seconds of overtime, have still not won a regular-season opener since Jan. 21, 1995, of the lockout-shortened 1994-95 season.</p>
        <p>It nevertheless was a distinguished night for Islanders center Claude Lapointe. He tied the score 9:57 into the third with his second eye-catching goal of the night. He stole the puck and came roaring up the ice, flanked by right wing Mark Parrish. At the last instant, he faked a pass and stuffed the puck by goalie Dan Cloutier.</p>
        <p>''That was a Wayne Gretzky-type move,'' Goring said.</p>
        <p>''In my dreams,'' Lapointe said when told of Goring's sentiment.</p>
        <p>Islanders defenseman Roman Hamrlik staked them to an early lead when he decided suddenly to shoot from the left point and beat Cloutier on the glove side at 7:36 into the game.</p>
        <p>The teams would go on to play a penalty-filled game, as Tampa Bay Coach Steve Ludzik had predicted considering the league's tighter enforcement of slashing. There were 20 penalties called, 10 on the Islanders.</p>
