        <p>Although it's risky to generalize about the nature of avant-garde cinema, it is reasonably safe to say that most experimental films are either exercises in perception or investigations of filmmaking technology. Often they are both. In tone and attitude, however, they still tend to fall into two types: personal, lyrical statements that invite us into private meditative worlds, and more abstract modernist works that affect an emotional detachment and aesthetic objectivity.</p>
        <p>At the New York Film Festival's annual ''Views From the Avant-Garde'' series, which is screening four different programs this weekend at the Walter Reade Theater, the dividing line has never been clearer.

        <p>Although it's risky to generalize about the nature of avant-garde cinema, it is reasonably safe to say that most experimental films are either exercises in perception or investigations of filmmaking technology. Often they are both. In tone and attitude, however, they still tend to fall into two types: personal, lyrical statements that invite us into private meditative worlds, and more abstract modernist works that affect an emotional detachment and aesthetic objectivity.</p>
        <p>At the New York Film Festival's annual ''Views From the Avant-Garde'' series, which is screening four different programs this weekend at the Walter Reade Theater, the dividing line has never been clearer. For this critic, those films with personal lyrical visions win hands down over the series's chillier experiments.</p>
        <p>Anyone with even a passing interest in cinema's avant-garde is encouraged to attend tonight's program of two silent films by Peter Hutton and Nathaniel Dorsky. Mr. Hutton's 35-minute ''Time and Tide'' (prefaced by a grainy reel of the Hudson River shot in 1903 by Billy Bitzer) is a haunting series of 45 shots filmed aboard a tugboat pulling a barge slowly up and down the Hudson between Bayonne, N.J., and Albany.</p>
        <p>On one level the film is a meditation on the river, its ecology, the changing sky and the shifting landscape from varying perspectives. (A number of shots observe the shoreline sliding beyond a porthole.) But as the barge plows through the water, the film also becomes a contemplation of velocity and the relativity of motion. Ultimately it evokes a rhythm of life that is slower than what we're used to in this age of jets and freeways.</p>
        <p>As its images accumulate, ''Time and Tide'' becomes a quiet celebration of a reflective and ultimately nurturing solitude in which mundane thoughts recede to the background as one's consciousness attunes itself to an environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorsky's ''Arbor Vitae'' conveys more acute feelings of sadness and ecstasy. The third part of his brilliant trilogy, which includes ''Triste'' and ''Variations,'' this is a sequence of exquisitely observed images of vanishing moments in a world in motion.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Dorsky's favorite images are branches and flowers being whipped by a stiff breeze. They convey a profound sense of life's physical intensity, of its furious, vibrating energy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorsky's candid camera also catches people rapt in thought. And  their grave concentration lends ''Arbor Vitae'' a more pronounced elegiac quality than is conveyed by the two earlier sections of his trilogy.</p>
        <p>Much of these films' power lies in their silence. They remind us that the process of quietly observing the world without trying to articulate our perceptions can be a rarefied state of being, that silence is often sacred.</p>
        <p>On the austere side of the experimental dividing line is Sharon Lockhart's 40-minute ''Teatro Amazonas,'' to be shown tomorrow night, in which the unmoving camera gazes at an audience of 308 people waiting for a performance inside the Amazonas Theater in Manaus, Brazil. Over the course of the film a minimalist choral soundtrack slowly, almost imperceptibly fades away, the voices of the audience in casual conversation rise to the fore, and the light in the theater undergoes subtle variations. The witty, seemingly endless credit sequence includes the names of all 308 audience members.</p>
        <p>Not every film in the four programs had press screenings. But among those that did, one that stood out was the madcap Canadian Guy Maddin's ''Heart of the World.'' Mr. Maddin has called this miniature accelerated mock Biblical epic ''the world's first subliminal melodrama.'' And the five-minute movie, which is only a fragment of the program, has the feel of a manic silent-film parody.</p>
        <p>Finally we have ''In Absentia,'' the Quay Brothers' ominous collaboration with the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Shot in Cinemascope, the film, which is part of a different program that also plays today and tomorrow, is a beautifully filmed 22-minute semi-abstract horror film that enters the mind of woman writing a letter to her husband from inside an insane asylum.</p>
