        <p>LUIS SOJO didn't trip last night. Instead, he tripped the Oakland Athletics, knocking in one run, scoring another and starting a flashy double play in the Yankees' 4-2 victory for a 2-1 jump in their American League division series.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing I'm here, but it's great,'' Sojo, the 34-year-old Venezuelan infielder, was saying now at his locker. ''I like to win. I don't care if I'm on second or third or on the bench, and I've been winning since I was 6 years old.''</p>

        <p>LUIS SOJO didn't trip last night. Instead, he tripped the Oakland Athletics, knocking in one run, scoring another and starting a flashy double play in the Yankees' 4-2 victory for a 2-1 jump in their American League division series.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing I'm here, but it's great,'' Sojo, the 34-year-old Venezuelan infielder, was saying now at his locker. ''I like to win. I don't care if I'm on second or third or on the bench, and I've been winning since I was 6 years old.''</p>
        <p>Traded by the Yankees in the off-season after helping to earn three World Series rings in four seasons, Sojo feared his major league career was over when he was released by the Pittsburgh Pirates. But when Chuck Knoblauch went on the disabled list, he suddenly was a Yankee again.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I didn't think I'd ever be back with the Yankees after they got Jose Vizcaino,'' he said, referring to the Yankees' other utility infielder. ''I told my wife, 'If the Yankees don't pick me up, I'll retire.' ''</p>
        <p>Instead, he's hitting .333 in this division series with a double and two singles in nine at-bats. Of the Yankees' 11 runs, he has been involved in six -- knocking in four and scoring two. And last night he started the seventh-inning double play that shut off what would have been the tying run.</p>
        <p>Before Terrence Long's grounder, Orlando Hernandez looked over at Sojo and yelled, in Spanish: ''He's going to hit it to you. Be ready.''</p>
        <p>Sojo lunged to his left, speared Long's grounder, turned and fired to shortstop Derek Jeter, who threw to Tino Martinez for the double play.</p>
        <p>''If we don't get two there, the tying run scores,'' Sojo said. ''That was one of the best plays I've ever made with the Yankees, yes.''</p>
        <p>Wednesday night in Oakland he made his worst play, tripping and falling after fielding a routine grounder. But when the Yankees won that game to square the series, his pratfall was laughed off.</p>
        <p>''It's over,'' he said last night. ''I don't worry about it anymore.''</p>
        <p>Sojo is now leading the charge of Cashman's Cavalry, the eight players obtained by General Manager Brian Cashman who rode to the team's rescue during the season with a total of 45 homers and 140 runs batted in.</p>
        <p>Sojo and Vizcaino were joined by outfielders David Justice, Luis Polonia and Glenallen Hill, the slugger Jose Canseco, and the pitchers Dwight Gooden and Denny Neagle.</p>
        <p>Half a century ago the Yankees occasionally snatched an elderly bat or arm to bolster a pennant drive, such as the future Hall of Fame sluggers Johnny Mize and Enos Slaughter, and the right-hander Johnny Sain. But has any team, much less a two-time reigning World Series champion, turned over roughly one-third of its roster during the season?</p>
        <p>These Yankees began their retooling in June when Jim Leyritz was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for the versatile Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>Around that time Gooden, after having been waived by both Houston and Tampa Bay, appealed to the Yankees' principal owner and Gooden's Tampa neighbor, George Steinbrenner, for a last chance. And got it.</p>
        <p>Neagle, the left-hander who was 7-7 with the Yankees after an 8-2 start with Cincinnati, was procured after the Yankees could not put together a trade for Curt Schilling, then with the Philadelphia Phillies.</p>
        <p>Oddly, the Yankees didn't realize that Justice, who hit 20 homers and drove in 60 runs with a .305 average for them, was available.</p>
        <p>''I called the Indians to find out where to send Gary Tuck his World Series ring,'' Cashman said, referring to a former Yankee coach. ''In the conversation, I asked what they were doing, like every G.M. does, and they told me Justice was available.''</p>
        <p>Although the Indians won't acknowledge it now after having rallied to finish only one game out of the playoffs, the Indians' front office, with so many of their players on the disabled list at the time, had given up on being a playoff contender.</p>
        <p>Hill, who would supply 16 home runs and 29 runs batted in with a .333 average, had set a Chicago Cubs record with nine pinch-hit homers.</p>
        <p>Early in August, the Yankees signed Polonia as a free agent. Four days later they claimed Canseco on waivers and, to their surprise, got him.</p>
        <p>But of all of Cashman's Cavalry, Luis Sojo has now emerged as the second baseman who is tripping the light fantastic instead of just tripping.</p>
