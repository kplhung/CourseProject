        <p>Rebuffing for the moment an attempt to stiffen auto safety laws, Congress passed a $58 billion transportation spending bill today.</p>
        <p>The House approved the bill by a vote of 344 to 50, while the Senate adopted it by 78 to 10. The bill's most notable feature is the setting of a stringent national standard for what constitutes drunken driving. President Clinton is expected to sign it.</p>
        <p>''This ground-breaking measure, which I have long advocated, will save hundreds of lives a year and represents a major victory for public safety and American families across the country,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement. The administration had pushed hard for the drunken driving measure, which reduces the amount of alcohol that must be detected in the blood to consider a motorist as driving under the influence.</p>
        <p>But overshadowing the votes approving the spending measure were the repeated unsuccessful attempts by Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, to bring tougher auto safety laws to the floor of the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, has proposed a bill requiring automakers to notify federal regulators about recalls of products in foreign markets and provide other information on defects they discover in their vehicles.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain's proposal was prompted by federal investigations and Congressional hearings into the actions of the maker of Firestone tires and of the Ford Motor Company involving tire failures and vehicle rollovers that have been linked to the deaths of 101 people.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain's measure would also increase, to $15 million from $800,000, the civil fines that the government may impose on automakers that willfully neglect to tell the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about safety defects. And it authorizes the secretary of transportation to seek criminal penalties, including jail terms, for auto executives who deliberately misinform regulators about safety defects.</p>
        <p>''The lives of American consumers are being placed at risk,'' Mr. McCain said in a statement. ''We must act quickly to resolve the flaws in N.H.T.S.A.'s data-collection process and prevent the recurrence of this crisis.''</p>
        <p>Critics of Mr. McCain's bill have focused their concerns on the measure's call for criminal penalties. ''We are really blurring the line between criminal liability and civil liability, and that's a dangerous trend,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican.</p>
        <p>Critics, like the United States Chamber of Commerce, say they prefer the House version, which would impose criminal penalties but only for filing false reports with the highway agency. Mr. McCain's bill would allow criminal penalties, including prison, for executives who knowingly ''order, authorize or ratify'' vehicles or equipment that violates federal safety standards and result in death or serious injury.</p>
        <p>Such a provision, critics say, would make companies hesitant to turn over information on defects to federal regulators and prompt companies not to cooperate in safety investigations.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain first tried to block consideration of the transportation bill until he was promised that the Senate would take up his bill at a later date. He lifted his hold on the spending measure after the majority leader, Trent Lott, assured him that the Senate would indeed debate his measure if no other lawmaker objected.</p>
        <p>But after the transportation bill was approved, several senators objected to having the Senate consider Mr. McCain's safety bill.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, as senators were hurrying out of town, Mr. McCain vowed to bring up the issue again.</p>
