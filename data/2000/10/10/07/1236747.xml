        <p>The unemployment rate in Canada dropped to 6.8 percent in September from 7.1 percent in August, as 56,300 new jobs were created -- the largest number so far this year and twice as many as economists had expected. The biggest employment gains were in the service sector, but renewed strength was also evident in manufacturing and construction. Derek Burleton, senior economist at the TD Bank Financial Group, said monthly job increases of 25,000 to 30,000 in the final quarter would probably drop Canada's unemployment rate to 6.6 percent by the end of the year, matching the 24-year lows of early summer.</p>
