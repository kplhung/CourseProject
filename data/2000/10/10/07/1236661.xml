        <p>Op-Ed article by Mike Stoller, songwriter and party in lawsuit against Napster, says it is not only online music services that are hurt by Napster, which helps people share music on Internet; says songwriters like himself, who depend on royalties they earn from sale of their songs, are also being injured; says Napster and companies like it are threatening livlihood of potential songwriters, and threatening future of music itself (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Much of the discussion in this week's hearing in federal appeals court over whether  Napster violates federal copyright law focused on how the online music service affects big record companies and recording artists. But they are not the only ones being hurt by Napster, which helps people share music on the Internet, and companies like it. Songwriters like me, who depend on the royalties they earn from the sale of their songs, are also being injured.</p>
        <p>In 1950, when I was 17, Jerry Leiber and I had our first song recorded, ''Real Ugly Woman,'' by Jimmy Witherspoon. Over the next 50 years, Jerry and I composed many now-familiar songs, like ''Hound Dog,'' ''Jailhouse Rock'' and ''Love Potion No. 9'' in many different musical styles, from rhythm and blues to jazz and rock. Our songs were recorded by many great artists, including Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Peggy Lee, Jimi Hendrix and the Coasters.</p>

        <p>Much of the discussion in this week's hearing in federal appeals court over whether  Napster violates federal copyright law focused on how the online music service affects big record companies and recording artists.

        <p>In 1950, when I was 17, Jerry Leiber and I had our first song recorded, ''Real Ugly Woman,'' by Jimmy Witherspoon. Over the next 50 years, Jerry and I composed many now-familiar songs, like ''Hound Dog,'' ''Jailhouse Rock'' and ''Love Potion No. 9'' in many different musical styles, from rhythm and blues to jazz and rock. Our songs were recorded by many great artists, including Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Peggy Lee, Jimi Hendrix and the Coasters.</p>
        <p>But whatever the style and whoever the artist, there has been one constant: the songs that I have written have been my bread and butter.</p>
        <p>Writing a song -- the music and the lyrics -- can take anywhere from 10 minutes (as in the case of ''Hound Dog'') to five years. But no matter how long it takes, it is always a gamble. A songwriter makes nothing until a song is marketed in the form of a recording for sale to the public, and unless that record of the song sells, a songwriter gets nothing for it. Each time a Napster user downloads  a copy of a song I have composed, I am deprived of the royalty that my work should have earned me.</p>
        <p>Some of those in favor of Napster say that making music available free of charge on the Web ''frees'' artists from the control of the recording industry. Many say that since making music is an art, artists like me should do it simply for the love of it. But how free can artists be to do what we love if we must spend most of our days doing something else to make a living?</p>
        <p>Where would I be today if anyone could have recorded ''Hound Dog,'' and anyone else could have copied that recording, without paying Jerry Leiber and me? I might have occasionally written some music for fun, but I would not have had the luxury to compose full time. Who knows what songs I might not have written?</p>
        <p>I fear for the 17-year-old songwriter looking forward to a career in the music business today. Napster and companies like it are threatening not only my retirement, but the future of music itself. In fact, by taking the incentive out of songwriting, Napster may be pushing itself closer to a time when there won't be any songs for its users to swap.</p>
