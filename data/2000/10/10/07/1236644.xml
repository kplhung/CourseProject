        <p>The subject of ''Platform'' is nothing less than the social and cultural transformation of China in the 1980's, the slow waning of Maoist orthodoxy and the gradual arrival of  Western popular culture and clothing styles.</p>
        <p>Slow and gradual also describe the director Jia Zhang Ke's approach to storytelling. Social change is incremental, and rarely noticed by those living through it. Mr. Jia shows the commercialization of provincial Chinese culture largely through incidental details. Pop music videos replace militaristic operas on television and color television sets replace black and white. The drab uniformity of socialist fashion gives way to spandex and pink polyester.</p>
        <p>The film, which will be shown as part of the New York Film Festival tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., begins with a performance by a troupe of ''arts workers'' called the Peasant Culture Group from Fenyang. In a theater illuminated by a single light bulb, they shuffle across the stage on stools, doing a number called ''Train Heading for Shaoshan,'' the ideological significance of which is that the train's destination is the birthplace of Mao Zedong. After the show, they gather for a self-criticism session in the school bus that transports them from town to town.</p>
        <p>Later on, after the arrest of Jiang Qing (Mao's widow and the chief promoter of his cultural revolution) and the ascendancy of Deng Xiaoping, the newly privatized group renames itself the All-Star Rock and Breakdance Electronic Band. It performs in the same dusty towns, but the male members brandish electric guitars and sport long rock star tresses, while the women prance around in sparkly outfits like the Solid Gold Dancers.</p>
        <p>The story, which unfolds episodically over more than three hours, might be described as a ''Boogie Nights'' about socialist cultural politics instead of pornography. (Its politics and rough-hewn style are closer to ''Bye Bye Brazil,'' Carlos Diegues's 1979 chronicle of a band of mountebanks journeying across the changing landscape or rural Brazil).</p>
        <p>Like P. T. Anderson's social history of smut, Mr. Jia's film follows a group of performers whose personal and working lives are closely entwined. Cui Minliang (Wang Hong-wei) and Zhang Jun (Liang Jing-dong), the main male characters, are both skinny, sullen young men locked in ambivalent romances with their fellow performers Ruijuan (Zhao Tao) and Zhong Pin (Yang Tiang-yi).</p>
        <p>Zhong Pin is the more daring of the two young women: she smokes and has her hair permed long before such practices become common in Fenyang. Later, she becomes pregnant by Jun and has an abortion.  Ruijuan is shy and conservative. Her relationship with the rebellious Mingliang seems checked by mutual passive-aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>When they are outdoors, Mr. Jia photographs his characters from a distance. The lovers argue on the ancient battlements that surround their hometown or stand in vast, empty winter fields. Interior spaces are either dimly lighted or flooded with harsh white backlighting. While these techniques often create visually arresting images, they also keep us detached from the human dimensions and emotional resonance of the story. The film seems to invert conventional notions of foreground and background, as if the feelings and choices of individuals were incidental and the real interest lay in their changing cultural milieu.</p>
        <p>Conceptually, this is a provocative approach to filmmaking, and it makes ''Platform'' an intellectually engaging movie. But Mr. Jia's careful objectivity and regard for material detail are not matched by narrative rigor. For long stretches of the movie, the principal female characters simply disappear. Toward the end, the All-Star Band returns to Fenyang from a dispiriting tour of the provinces, and Cui Mingliang is reunited with Ruijuan, who has become a tax collector.</p>
        <p>But we don't know when or why she left the troupe or how long she was away. The next thing we know, she's holding a baby on her hip while making tea on the new gas stove (which has replaced the charcoal braziers used in earlier scenes), while Mingliang snoozes on the couch.</p>
        <p>The historical thesis is clear enough: bourgeois domesticity and consumer capitalism have replaced collectivism. We grasp this as a historical fact, but not as an experience. Or to put it another way, the characters in ''Platform'' live through a lot of history, but the history -- and the film itself -- never really come alive.</p>
        <p>PLATFORM  Written and directed by Jia Zhang Ke; in Mandarin, with English subtitles; director of photography, Yu Lik-wai; edited by Kong Jing-lei; music by Yoshihiro Hanno; art director, Qiu Sheng; produced by Li Kit-ming and Shozo Ichiyama. Running time: 198 minutes. This film is not rated. Shown tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall as part of the 38th New York Film Festival.</p>
        <p>WITH: Wang Hong-wei (Cui Minliang), Liang Jing-dong (Zhang Jun), Zhao Tao (Ruijuan) and Yang Tiang-yi (Zhong Pin).</p>
