        <p>SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. is a front-runner in the bidding for the Block Drug Company of Jersey City, the maker of Sensodyne toothpaste and Polident denture cleaners, a person close to SmithKline said today.</p>
        <p>Block Drug would fit well with SmithKline's oral consumer products division, which includes the Aquafresh brand. SmithKline itself is being acquired by another British pharmaceutical giant, Glaxo Wellcome, for $76 billion.</p>

        <p>SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. is a front-runner in the bidding for the Block Drug Company of Jersey City, the maker of Sensodyne toothpaste and Polident denture cleaners, a person close to SmithKline said today.</p>
        <p>Block Drug would fit well with SmithKline's oral consumer products division, which includes the Aquafresh brand. SmithKline itself is being acquired by another British pharmaceutical giant, Glaxo Wellcome, for $76 billion.</p>
        <p>Block Drug, which is closely held, retained Goldman Sachs in June to find a buyer. Analysts expect the company to fetch around $1.2 billion, or $50 a share.</p>
        <p>It is unclear, however, whether SmithKline will secure Block Drug, as other buyers are also expected to bid. The Wall Street Journal reported today that the Church &amp; Dwight Company, Unilever P.L.C. and the Sara Lee Corporation are believed to have looked at the company.</p>
