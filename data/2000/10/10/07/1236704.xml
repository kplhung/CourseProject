        <p>In this truly multicultural organization, there are caucuses of almost every imaginable kind -- region, geographical classification (small islands, landlocked countries and so on) and even religion (Islamic nations). But until today, there was no caucus of democratic nations.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, on the day that a new chapter in democracy was being written in Yugoslavia, representatives of dozens of democracies, old and new, met for the first time to inaugurate a group of their own. The caucus, which stems from an American-sponsored conference in Warsaw in June, is open to about 110 countries. All but a few of them, calling themselves a ''community of democracies,'' signed on in Warsaw to a declaration affirming their commitment to democratic institutions and the protection of human rights. The rest signed later. About half the signers were represented here today.</p>
        <p>Among the major democratic governments, only France refused to sign the pledge or attend today's meeting. The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said after rejecting the pact that democracy could not be imposed. He warned against political ''triumphalism.''</p>
        <p>Morton H. Halperin, director of policy planning at the State Department, who was in New York for the inaugural meeting, described the Warsaw declaration as a political document, not a legally binding agreement. ''What was very explicit,'' he said, ''was that democracy is a path, not a destination; that there are no perfect democracies; that old democracies can learn from new; that new democracies can learn from old.''</p>
        <p>In Warsaw, India proposed that democratic countries should meet together as often as possible and that a caucus at the United Nations would be useful for discussing issues being debated at the organization and perhaps for agreeing on common positions.</p>
        <p>Today, a Romanian-sponsored resolution calling for steps to bolster new democracies was discussed, and Benin told the caucus about a conference it will hold in December, with United Nations support, on ''new and restored democracies.''</p>
        <p>Membership in the democratic caucus is not permanent, Mr. Halperin said. Backsliders may be asked to leave, or not be invited to the next meeting.</p>
