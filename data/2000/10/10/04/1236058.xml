        <p>Maybe the only good thing that happened to the Yankees over the last few weeks is that they nursed their wounds. The Yankees finished the regular season dropping 15 of their last 18 games and seven in a row, but left fielder David Justice rested his strained groin regularly, Bernie Williams's strained rib cage seemed to heal and right fielder Paul O'Neill's hip pointer improved.</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre was also able to rest third baseman Scott Brosius (leg problems) and first baseman Tino Martinez (sore elbow). ''I feel we're ready to play,'' Torre said. ''I think we're as healthy as we've ever been.''</p>

        <p>Maybe the only good thing that happened to the Yankees over the last few weeks is that they nursed their wounds. The Yankees finished the regular season dropping 15 of their last 18 games and seven in a row, but left fielder David Justice rested his strained groin regularly, Bernie Williams's strained rib cage seemed to heal and right fielder Paul O'Neill's hip pointer improved.</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre was also able to rest third baseman Scott Brosius (leg problems) and first baseman Tino Martinez (sore elbow). ''I feel we're ready to play,'' Torre said. ''I think we're as healthy as we've ever been.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill is a creature of habit who loves and needs to take batting practice to maintain his swing, and he went 4 for 31 with no extra-base hits and no runs scored after returning to the lineup on Sept. 22. But Torre said that Justice, who struggled toward the end of the year, began to drive the ball again the final weekend; he mentioned Justice when asked about which player he feels good about as the playoffs begin.</p>
        <p>''He's had such a big year for us,'' Torre said. ''But again, to be successful, you go back to those guys at the top of the order. If you get those two guys on base, it's going to be a little different for the pitcher.''</p>
        <p>Traffic Problems</p>
        <p>The bus ride from San Francisco to the Network Associates Coliseum here usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes, according to the locals. But many of the Yankees sat through a ride of about 45 minutes, arriving here just before the team was supposed to begin stretching for batting practice. Some news media members said that it took as long as two hours to navigate the traffic.</p>
        <p>A car accident in downtown Oakland stopped traffic on Interstate 880. ''As soon as we came across the Bay Bridge, it was all backed up,'' Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte said. ''We took a short cut, and I guess we went through all kinds of neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>Roger Clemens, the Yankees' starting pitcher for tonight's game, was on the bus that arrived late. Clemens has a strict pregame regimen that includes stretching and other exercises, and some treatment, before he begins to throw in the bullpen. It was not clear if the delay would affect his pregame workout.</p>
        <p>Memorable Ejection</p>
        <p>Thursday marks the 10-year anniversary of Roger Clemens's infamous ejection in the 1990 playoffs. Clemens was pitching for Boston here against Oakland that year, and when the home plate umpire Terry Cooney made a couple of calls in the second inning that Clemens did not like, Clemens yelled something from the mound and Cooney ejected him. Some consider it one of the most controversial moments in postseason history.</p>
        <p>''Those were not pleasant times,'' Clemens said Monday. ''Like I said, it was just miscommunication. That's all it was. I think it got blown out of proportion. I don't know if the guy lost his job over it or not. I don't know where he went from there. I felt like I was in the right, and it worked out.''</p>
