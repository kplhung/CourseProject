        <p>It was the snap of nail clippers from the adjoining cubicle that finally got to Jeanine Smartt. Her colleague at the Manhattan public relations firm made a habit of grooming his hands on the job, and she could not concentrate on her work until he finished.</p>
        <p>''It got to the point where I told him he had to stop until one of us got promoted and moved to an office,'' recalled Ms. Smartt, who has since joined MTV Networks as the vice president for corporate communications.</p>
        <p>For Kirstin Olsen, an assistant vice president at Chase Manhattan, it was a phone call from an ex-boyfriend that drove home the lack of cubicle privacy. She tried to be diplomatic in explaining why she was breaking up with him, but he would not listen. So, she said: ''I found myself screaming to get him to understand. When I finally managed to get off the phone, my neighbors teased me enormously.''</p>
        <p>It was being forced to listen to someone else that made Maureen Whelan cringe. A colleague at the New York office of the HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, where she was a first vice president, was holding a loud phone conversation when he suddenly blurted out a crude phrase to indicate he had to hurry off to the men's room. But instead of hanging up, he just kept talking, and ''a few minutes later he was repeating that again -- only louder.''</p>
        <p>The open office is driving people up a wall. When cubicles swept the workplace in the 1970's, they were promoted as productivity-boosters. The movement became unstoppable in the 1990's, as teamwork and rapid communication became the hallmarks of the high-technology workplace. Cubicle sales last year totaled $4.4 billion, or 36 percent of all office-furniture sales.</p>
        <p>But as more employers eliminate closed doors and create mazes of open workstations, more workers are complaining about the downside -- what Elizabeth Wolfe Morrison, associate professor of management and organizational behavior at New York University's Stern School of Business, calls ''the noise spillover that inevitably drifts from one cubicle to another.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it is the people who drift: unlike the traditional office, doorless cubicles often act as magnets for windbags.</p>
        <p>To reclaim their privacy, workers are concocting some inventive strategies. When her boyfriend calls her, for example, Elizabeth Fox, an account executive with Makovsky &amp; Company, a New York public relations firm, speaks to him in French. And Caroline Champ, a program coordinator at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, simply uses the phone in her director's office.</p>
        <p>Some people have taken another route to sanity: surrender. Ms. Olsen, who created a stir by shouting at her boyfriend, says she is usually guarded on the phone. ''If there's something really personal that I need to say, I use e-mail,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The strains of working in an open space have aroused the interest of psychologists and human-resources experts, and they are not shy about suggesting ways to cope.</p>
        <p>One is to follow Ms. Olsen's example and bow to the inevitable. ''A cubicle is essentially a public space,'' said Brad Agry, a career counselor with CareerTeam Partners in Manhattan, and people who work in them should recognize that their phone conversations are likely to be overheard. For that reason, Mr. Agry recommends that workers minimize all personal phone calls or else find a hideaway -- like a boss's office, an empty conference room or even a pay phone in the lobby -- to make them.</p>
        <p>But people should not only strive to protect their own privacy; the golden rule of cubicle life is to speak with a soft voice and hold phone conversations as short as possible to avoid distracting neighbors, he says.</p>
        <p>A subsidiary rule is to ask others to return the favor. ''There's nothing wrong with telling a loudmouth to keep it down,'' Mr. Agry said.</p>
        <p>That does not mean one should become nasty, said Hendrie Weisinger, a Westport, Conn., psychologist who specializes in workplace issues and is the author of ''Emotional Intelligence at Work'' (Jossey-Bass, 2000). If a co-worker is playing music that annoys others, for example, ''the trick is to let him know in a nonthreatening way'' how you feel, he said. ''Why not, for instance, chip in with your co-workers to buy that music lover a pair of Sony earphones?''</p>
        <p>If a worker does blow up, he should not apologize for the lapse, Mr. Agry advises. ''Chances are, your fellow workers are just glad you're off the phone. They don't care about your explanation because it means losing still more time from work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Likewise, he recommends remaining silent about indiscretions that neighbors commit -- unless they solicit an opinion. ''Just file it in your head,'' he said. ''Remember that it's not officially your business.''</p>
        <p>What about unwanted schmoozers? Body language usually deflects them, Dr. Weisinger said. For hard-core cases, he suggests the direct approach: a green ribbon that says it's O.K. to stop by, and a red one that shouts: Go away.</p>
        <p>The Seven Sins</p>
        <p>Careeer counselors list these workplace no-no's:  EAVESDROPPING -- If you do overhear a sensitive conversation, do not comment on it unless asked.  MAKING NOISE -- The big ones include cursing, playing loud music and clipping nails.  EMITTING ODORS -- Avoid strong perfumes and food.  BEING NOSY -- Do not peer into a co-worker's cubicle or stop by uninvited to chat.  BEING PERSONAL -- Do not talk about personal matters on the phone.  ACTING HUSH-HUSH -- Do not suddenly lower your voice that is a signal for co-workers to perk up their ears.  BEING MESSY -- Keep a neat desk particularly if you share a cubicle.</p>
