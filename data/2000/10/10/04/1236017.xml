        <p>In every postseason, Mike Piazza said, there is a moment of clarity that takes away all the pressure. Last year, the Mets' catcher said, he felt it when the Mets and the Atlanta Braves staged two extra-inning thrillers to close out the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>''Those were two epic games, and I think everyone who's been on this team can draw from that,'' Piazza said. ''You look around and say: 'Wow, I'm glad I'm here. I'm glad I'm taking part in this, because this is what baseball's all about.' You can get a little philosophical.''</p>

        <p>In every postseason, Mike Piazza said, there is a moment of clarity that takes away all the pressure. Last year, the Mets' catcher said, he felt it when the Mets and the Atlanta Braves staged two extra-inning thrillers to close out the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>''Those were two epic games, and I think everyone who's been on this team can draw from that,'' Piazza said. ''You look around and say: 'Wow, I'm glad I'm here. I'm glad I'm taking part in this, because this is what baseball's all about.' You can get a little philosophical.''</p>
        <p>The Mets won the chance to make more magic this October by capturing the wild card for the second year in a row, earning a first-round date with the San Francisco Giants. The teams meet in Game 1 on Wednesday at 4 p.m. Eastern, and both teams are hot. The Giants went 21-9 after Aug. 31, and the Mets have won eight of their last nine games.</p>
        <p>''It was actually pretty ugly for a while,'' said the Mets' Game 1 starter, Mike Hampton. ''But we finished on a winning note. We have some momentum coming into the postseason.''</p>
        <p>The teams worked out today at Pacific Bell Park, and the Mets seemed relaxed, watching playoff games on the clubhouse televisions and wondering if they could get tickets to tonight's Yankees- Athletics game across the bay.</p>
        <p>There was only one health question, involving the status of Timo Perez's right hamstring. The Mets' rookie outfielder is at about 80 percent, according to Manager Bobby Valentine, who held off naming his playoff roster and his starting lineup. Perez will make the roster if he is healthy.</p>
        <p>The Mets were swept here in a four-game series in May that represented their low point of the season, third baseman Robin Ventura said. In August, when the teams met at Shea, the atmosphere was heightened and the Mets won three of four games.</p>
        <p>The formula to beat the Giants begins with shutting down Barry Bonds. In the three games the Mets won, they limited the slugging outfielder to 1 hit in 11 at-bats. In the five games the Giants won, Bonds was 9 for 20.</p>
        <p>''Just like they have to control the middle of their lineup, we have to control the middle of their lineup and hold leads late in the game,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said.</p>
        <p>The middle of the Mets' lineup is swinging well. Second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo batted .319 after Aug. 30, Piazza .300 in his last 13 games and third baseman Robin Ventura .309 in his last 17. Valentine said he paid close attention to resting those players down the stretch.</p>
        <p>The players think it worked, to a degree. By clinching a week before opening the playoffs, Alfonzo said, the Mets had time to recuperate and get a new energy, a luxury they didn't have last season.</p>
        <p>''My body actually looks like an old banana, but it's fine,'' said Piazza, who caught 124 games this year, 13 fewer than last year. ''It's been a long year. All of us have worked hard, and we've got some war wounds. But we're ready to go.''</p>
        <p>Ventura knew he would have to become more of a force in the postseason because teams would rather pitch to him than to Piazza, who bats in front of him. He seems prepared;  his plate coverage and balance are better, and Ventura said this is the best he has felt all year.</p>
        <p>''When you know that you're not feeling that great, you just kind of go up there and see what you can do,'' said Ventura, who has doubled twice this year off the Giants' Game 1 starter, Livan Hernandez. ''When you go up there and you feel good, it's a lot different. You feel able to handle the tough pitches.''</p>
        <p>Hampton also turned around his season, though his slump lasted only through his start here in May. Battered by the Giants and with an earned run average of 6.52, Hampton walked back to the team hotel alone; a gut check, he said.</p>
        <p>After that, Hampton went 13-6 with a 2.41 E.R.A., and he is pitching with the aggressiveness that made him so successful for Houston, which traded him to New York last December.</p>
        <p>''It was more mental than anything,'' Hampton said. ''Just the reputation I had to live up to, feeling I had to impress the guys. They got me over here to be the No. 1 guy. I had to show them I was worthy of that. I never doubted myself having the physical talent to get there, but basically it was like, 'Just go out and do the job. Throw strikes and be aggressive, like I've always been.' ''</p>
        <p>Hampton beat the Giants in August, and he is 9-0 against them in his career. The left-hander Al Leiter, who starts Game 2 on Thursday, pitched eight shutout innings of two-hit ball to beat the Giants that same series. The Giants were 19-20 against left-handers, and their star second baseman, Jeff Kent, is 8 for 32 in his career against Hampton, 3 for 20 against Leiter.</p>
        <p>''I don't necessarily subscribe to the fact that the Giants struggled against left-handers,'' Valentine said. ''I saw some games that they knocked them around pretty good. And the reason I'm throwing two left-handers here is for obvious reasons.''</p>
        <p>The obvious: Hampton and Leiter are the Mets' two best starters. Rick Reed is the third, and he will start Game 3 at Shea on Saturday. Valentine would not say who will start Game 4, because, he said, he doesn't know if there will be a fourth game.</p>
        <p>The left-hander Glendon Rusch and the right-hander Bobby J. Jones will be available in the bullpen. If the Mets trail in the series after three games, Hampton could come back for Game 4.</p>
        <p>But those issues are for later. For now, the Mets are comfortable that this team can win the National League pennant for the first time since 1986. As Piazza pointed out today, every team in the N.L. playoffs has had the league's best record at some point. The winner will be the team that rediscovers that form.</p>
        <p>''I'm confident that we have the talent it will take to get to the World Series,'' Phillips said. ''But we only get there if we go out and execute and play to our talent level.''</p>
