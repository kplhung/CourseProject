        <p>Mark David Chapman, who shot and killed John Lennon 20 years ago, was denied parole today after a 50-minute hearing at Attica state prison.</p>
        <p>Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, had written to ask the New York State Parole Board to keep Mr. Chapman, 45, in prison, saying that she and Lennon's children would live in fear if he was freed and that the killer himself might be in danger if released.</p>
        <p>''Myself and John's two sons would not feel safe for the rest of our lives,'' she wrote.</p>
        <p>The Parole Board, in its statement denying Mr. Chapman's first bid for parole, wrote: ''Your most vicious and violent act was apparently fueled by your need to be acknowledged. During your parole hearing, this panel noted your continued interest in maintaining your notoriety.'' Mr. Chapman is serving a sentence of 20 years to life in prison.</p>
        <p>Although a Parole Board spokeswoman said that none of Mr. Chapman's or Lennon's family members were allowed to attend the hearing today, Ms. Ono was invited to share her views.</p>
        <p>In her letter, she called the crime cruel and unjust, and added, ''When people asked how I felt about the killer of my husband, I have always told them that I didn't think about that day anymore.'' She added, ''But in actual fact, the memory of that night has never left me for the last 20 years.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ono, who was in Japan today for the opening of a John Lennon museum, later recorded herself reading the letter for use by radio and television news organizations, her spokesman, Elliot Mintz, said. ''She respects the board's decision,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also wrote to oppose parole, saying that Mr. Chapman had planned the murder ''in order to become famous himself,'' and that Mr. Chapman had considered killing other celebrities, including Elizabeth Taylor and David Bowie.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Lennon was a unique musical talent whose vast influence extended well beyond music,'' Mr. Giuliani wrote. ''He was a beloved citizen of his adopted home, New York City, and 20 years later, the impact of his death is still felt.''</p>
        <p>The Parole Board's statement recounted the events of Dec. 8, 1980, when Mr. Chapman killed Lennon, 40. Mr. Chapman waited outside the Dakota, the Manhattan apartment building at 72nd Street and Central Park West where Lennon lived, until Lennon and Ms. Ono returned from a recording session. When the couple got out of their limousine, Mr. Chapman called Lennon's name and emptied his revolver, hitting Lennon at least four times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapman, who had borrowed money for a ticket from his home in Hawaii to New York to find Lennon, was arrested minutes later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapman, who had been treated for mental illness and had attempted suicide, had apparently come to identify closely with the singer. Like Lennon, he married a woman of Japanese descent, and at the end of his last day of work as a security guard, he signed his name ''John Lennon,'' his former boss told reporters after the murder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 1981.</p>
        <p>''This act was calculated and unprovoked,'' the Parole Board said in its decision today. ''You had planned this crime for a protracted period of time and it is apparent that you were obsessed in causing fatal harm to John Lennon. In addition to being an international celebrity, Mr. Lennon was a husband and a father of two young children.'' Neither of Lennon's sons, Julian, who was 17 at the time of the murder, and Sean, who was 5, were present in Attica today.</p>
        <p>But among the television vans lined up across the street from the castlelike walls of the prison, one fan kept a vigil. The fan, Kristy Mundt, 48, said she had traveled from the San Diego region, where she works as a grocery store clerk. ''Just had a feeling I should be here,'' said Ms. Mundt, who wore a T-shirt bearing  an image of Lennon seated at a piano.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mundt, who runs a Beatles fan club, said she had sent the board a petition to deny parole, bearing 30,000 signatures that she had collected from many countries.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe he's reformed,'' she said of Mr. Chapman. ''I don't think he shows any remorse. If he had to make any decisions on his own, I don't think he would make the right decisions that you or I would make.''</p>
        <p>The Parole Board's decision was not out of the ordinary. Only 5.6 percent of inmates convicted of murder or attempted murder are released on parole the first time they appear before the board.</p>
        <p>The Parole Board noted Mr. Chapman's ''exemplary disciplinary record'' in prison and the fact that his special housing status had prevented him from attending ''anti-violence and/or anti-aggression programming.'' Mr. Chapman has been held in protective custody, away from other inmates, a spokesman for the Department of Correction said, because the notoriety of his crime put him at risk of being attacked.</p>
        <p>Jack Jones, the author of ''Let Me Take You Down,'' a book about Mr. Chapman, also waited outside the prison today. Mr. Jones, whose most recent interview with Mr. Chapman was in July, said Mr. Chapman would not appeal today's decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapman will be eligible for parole again in two years.</p>
