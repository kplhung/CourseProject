        <p>Trying to demonstrate that the appeal of the Microsoft verdict can be handled quickly, the Justice Department proposed a schedule for the filing of documents in the case today, two days earlier than scheduled, and called for a filing period half as long as the one Microsoft proposed on Monday.</p>
        <p>''As the court has recognized,'' the government wrote, the case is ''of exceptional importance.''

        <p>Trying to demonstrate that the appeal of the Microsoft verdict can be handled quickly, the Justice Department proposed a schedule for the filing of documents in the case today, two days earlier than scheduled, and called for a filing period half as long as the one Microsoft proposed on Monday.</p>
        <p>''As the court has recognized,'' the government wrote, the case is ''of exceptional importance.'' And because the trial judge in the case stayed the judgment and remedy against Microsoft until appeals are complete, it said, ''it is essential for effective antitrust law enforcement in a critical sector of the nation's economy that the appeal should be concluded expeditiously.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Microsoft asked the appeals court to allow more than five months for the filing of documents in its appeal of the antitrust judgment against the company. Microsoft's plan would carry the filing period into late March or early April.</p>
        <p>Today the Justice Department and 19 states that are allied with it in the case asked for a period for filing briefs that would end a few days before Christmas.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, the government said, has already had ''ample time to formulate its position.'' Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's final judgment and remedy order were issued on June 7, almost four months ago.</p>
        <p>The government proposes to have Microsoft file its appeal by Nov. 1. The government would file a response on Dec. 8, and Microsoft would be allowed to reply no later than Dec. 22.</p>
        <p>Microsoft had also proposed to file an appeal of 56,000 words, four times what the court normally allows. Today the government proposed appeal documents no longer than 24,000 words, not quite twice as long as normal.</p>
        <p>''The excessively long briefs Microsoft seeks to file would burden the court and inevitably delay disposition of the appeal,'' the government wrote.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued this evening, Microsoft said: ''Microsoft's appeal will raise a broad number of legal, factual and procedural issues. We have suggested a schedule and briefing length that will allow for a prompt and efficient process to consider the appeal.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department separately announced two promotions within the antitrust division, after the departure on Friday of Joel I. Klein, who headed the division.</p>
        <p>A. Douglas Melamed, the new acting head of the division, promoted John M. Names to the No. 2 spot in the division, the job Mr. Melamed had held. Mr. Names had been deputy assistant attorney general.</p>
        <p>Stepping into that job now is Jeffrey H. Blattner, who has been a special counsel in the division serving as chief of staff for the Microsoft case. Of Mr. Blattner, Mr. Klein said: ''Jeff's extraordinary legal skill, strategic acumen and sound judgment made him an invaluable adviser to me.''</p>
