        <p>WHILE French restaurant and country cooking have been thoroughly examined by American home cooks, somewhere between the two styles lies a branch of cuisine that has been almost entirely missed: France's bar and cafe food. This is the realm of snacks like tartines and rillettes, salads and savory tarts, and one of most delicious of all: the croque-monsieur.</p>
        <p>It is fast food in its best form: a small, strong taste that quickly calms your hunger. Described most simply, it's a grilled ham and cheese sandwich that was ubiquitous in French cafes long before ''le sandwich'' corrupted things.</p>
        <p>You can find le croque-monsieur in New York, too. In fact, in great numbers. As brasseries and bistros clone themselves around the city, it is multiplying as well. Brasseries and cafes tend to stick to the classic design: ham, Gruyere cheese and white bread. Other restaurants can't help but toy with it. In a few chefs' hands, the croque-monsieur has evolved into a sophisticated dish with only suggestions of its provenance.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean you should order them freely. (Nor should you in Paris, for that matter.) Like a deli corned beef sandwich, the croque-monsieur -- literally, crunch sir -- is a difficult construction to get right. And few do. The good ones stick with you, and unfortunately, so do the bad ones. It is difficult to shake off a greasy grilled cheese.</p>
        <p>Good croque-monsieurs have a few things in common: a single layer of French ham and Gruyere pressed between two thin slices of bread. Some are filled with bechamel, or white sauce, which makes the whole thing creamier and better. (Some have broiled cheese and bechamel on top.) The bread is brushed with butter, and the sandwich is cooked on a griddle or toasted under a broiler so that the cheese almost liquefies and the bits of ham and cheese hanging out the side fall limp and caramelize. It should be rich, substantial and salty, so  you will reach for a glass of wine or beer between bites.</p>
        <p>That is what is served at Bar Six in Greenwich Village. The version there is also seared in a scallop-shaped press, like a waffle iron, so that when you eat it, it's like biting into a cream puff, with a crisp exterior and a soft center.</p>
        <p>The croque-monsieur at Payard Patisserie on the Upper East Side is entirely different. Ham, Gruyere and bechamel are inside, and a layer of grated Gruyere goes on top like a shag rug. It's heated in a kind of turbo-toaster oven that browns the bottom and turns the top into a bubbling pool of cheese, which streams over the side and onto the plate.</p>
        <p>You see both kinds of croque-monsieur in Paris, the Bar Six style in smaller family-run bars, the more precious Payard type in large cafes on busy streets like Boulevard Saint-Germain. What you won't see in cafes and bars in Paris, however, are versions that transcend the original, which began showing up on menus early in the 20th century, according to ''The Oxford Companion to Food'' (Oxford University Press). Why bother? any sensible Frenchman would ask. What is wrong with a great ham and cheese sandwich? Nothing, until you taste the ''croque-monsieur'' at Le Bernardin. Eric Ripert, the chef, said it was inspired by his grandmother's recipe, though I'll bet she wouldn't recognize it.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Ripert's medium is fish, he replaces the ham with cured salmon and layers it with a thin slice of Gruyere, sprinkles it with chives and lemon zest and then drops an enormous lump of osetra caviar on top. He presses a second piece of bread on top of this, soaks the exterior of the sandwich with melted butter and then cooks it like a fish, browning both sides on a flat iron grill and then finishing it in the oven.</p>
        <p>Once the cheese has melted, Mr. Ripert cuts the sandwich into triangles and serves them pointed upward like spikes next to a checkerboard of apples and cucumbers cut in squares.</p>
        <p>''We didn't know if the customers would think we were joking or not,'' Mr. Ripert said. ''But immediately they were liking it.''</p>
        <p>It's difficult not to laugh as you eat it. It's a wonderful paradox: ethereally light, but devilishly indulgent.</p>
        <p>Diane Forley, the chef at Bar Demi near Gramercy Park, also pulls off an amusing riff on the sandwich. She layers white bread, mascarpone, fontina and Black Forest ham in a loaf pan, then pours a custard on top and bakes the whole assemblage like a terrine, which she then cubes and skewers. The  strong flavors of French ham and Gruyere are still there, but she mixes up the textures.  Lacking crisp edges, the cubes of bread and cheese are moist and as soft as marshmallows; only the thickly sliced ham is chewy, and pleasantly so.</p>
        <p>Ms. Forley said she wanted to integrate the flavors of a croque-monsieur. Fontina has a gentler, sweeter flavor than Gruyere, and the custard, like a bechamel sauce, gives it moisture.</p>
        <p>Many restaurants and cafes try simply to produce the classic, but they often end up with what amounts to a deli sandwich with the facade of a croque-monsieur -- the bubbling cheese molded over white sandwich bread. Inside lies a bad scene: a mountain of meat, and too much cheese.</p>
        <p>It was never meant to be a huge meal. Like so many French cafe and bar foods, it is made with rich, strong, affordable ingredients. You aren't meant to wolf down several. One should be enough to tide you over to a real meal.</p>
        <p>And while a croque-monsieur is inherently uncomplicated, it's like mashed potatoes, grilled steak and chocolate chip cookies: simple in principle, but vexing to master.  Since there are very few ingredients, they must all be good. You need French ham, which is similar to American ham but a little drier, fattier and saltier. The Gruyere should be bought in a large piece off a wheel and sliced at home. You'll need good butter, too.</p>
        <p>The correct bread is the most difficult element. French sandwich bread is different from its American counterpart. (In no event should sourdough or whole wheat be used.) White sandwich bread is good because it is often made with shortening or butter, which gives the sandwich an added roundness of flavor, but it can turn mushy, especially when toasted in a griddle. I had the most success with a sturdy country bread with a thick crust. It had enough moisture to blend with the cheese and meat and had a pleasant tang to it.</p>
        <p>With these four ingredients, I tried what seemed like every permutation of the formula. I layered cheese, meat, cheese; meat, cheese, meat; just cheese, meat. I cooked the sandwich by browning it on both sides in an iron crepe pan and finishing it in the oven, and also by cooking it in a hinged sandwich maker. None of these were failures. But something was missing. The sandwich was too coarse. I had avoided making bechamel out of sheer laziness. But as soon as I committed five minutes to stirring together butter, flour, milk, salt and nutmeg, I had my solution.</p>
        <p>I sliced the bread a quarter inch thick and the cheese paper-thin; I bought ham sliced as thin as prosciutto. I spread one side of a bread slice with a thick layer of bechamel. On it I laid two slices of ham and a single slice of cheese, making sure a little bit of each hung over the sides. I brushed both sides of the sandwich with butter, letting it soak into the crusts, then pressed it in a sandwich maker that had been heating on high for about 20 minutes. When the sandwich was browned and compressed, and the cheese was leaking out and boiling on the metal, it was done.</p>
        <p>The bread was toasted dark and the weight of the griddle had flattened it. Inside, it was moist and soft; the exterior had become a thin crackly shell, like a potato chip, with cooked bits of cheese and ham on the edges. The center of the sandwich, with the bechamel and the melted cheese, was more like a warm, thick custard.</p>
        <p>It had the unapologetic richness of great French food.</p>
        <p>One issue I struggled with as I tried sandwich after sandwich was whether to cut off the crusts. Without them, the croque-monsieur turns out somewhere between an English tea sandwich and an American grilled cheese. Both are delightful in their own right. But I couldn't imagine any thrifty French cook trimming crusts unless she planned to make bread crumbs from the trimmings. It's a French creation, and unless you have it in you to leave France entirely and spread caviar on your croque-monsieur, you might as well stay there while making it.</p>
        <p>CROQUE-MONSIEUR  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>5 tablespoons butter  1 tablespoon flour</p>
        <p>2/3 cup milk  Sea salt  Freshly grated nutmeg  4  1/3-inch-thick slices country bread  4 thin slices French ham  2 thin slices Gruyere cheese.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat a two-sided electric griddle on medium-high to high for about 20 minutes, or preheat the oven to 300 degrees and preheat a cast-iron skillet on top of the stove for about 5 minutes. Prepare a bechamel sauce: in a small saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. When bubbles have subsided, add flour and whisk vigorously for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in  milk until smooth. Bring to a boil, and cook until thick. Remove from heat, and season to taste with salt and nutmeg.</p>
        <p>2. Spread two slices of bread generously with sauce. Lay two slices of ham on top of each, and top each with a slice of cheese;  ham and cheese should slightly overlap  edges of bread. Top each with a slice of bread.</p>
        <p>3. In a small saucepan, melt remaining the 4 tablespoons butter. Brush the sandwiches on both sides with butter, making sure that the edges are well covered. If you're using a griddle, place cheese side down, close the griddle and cook until the bread is toasted dark and cheese is leaking out and bubbling.  If you're using a skillet, place sandwiches cheese side down and cook on stove top until well browned, then turn and brown again.  Transfer skillet to oven, and bake until heated through and cheese is bubbling.  Serve hot.  Yield: 2 sandwiches.</p>
        <p>CROQUE-MONSIEUR WITH SALMON AND CAVIAR  Adapted from Le Bernardin  Time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>For the croque-monsieur:  12 slices sandwich bread,  1/2 inch thick  6 ounces Gruyere cheese, sliced  1/8 inch thick  12 ounces sliced smoked salmon  1 tablespoon blanched lemon zest  1 tablespoon sliced chives  6 ounces osetra caviar (optional)  8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted.</p>
        <p>1. On 6 slices of bread, place cheese; on other 6 slices, place smoked salmon. Sprinkle salmon with lemon zest; sprinkle cheese with chives. Place an ounce of caviar on each of the slices with salmon. Form 6 sandwiches by putting the slices with salmon together with the slices with cheese.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat a large saute pan over medium heat. Brush butter over both sides of each sandwich, including edges. Working in batches, place sandwiches in pan with the cheese side down, and saute until browned, about 2 minutes. Raise heat to high, turn and saute 1 minute on salmon side.</p>
        <p>3. Slice croque-monsieurs on diagonal, then on diagonal again, and serve.  Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>BAR DEMI'S CROQUE-MONSIEUR  Time: 1 hour 40 minutes, plus at least 2 hours' resting</p>
        <p>Butter  20 slices high-quality white bread, crusts removed</p>
        <p>1/2 cup mascarpone cheese  2 tablespoons chopped chives, herb puree or pesto</p>
        <p>1/2 pound grated fontina cheese</p>
        <p>1/2 pound thinly sliced Black Forest ham  2 cups cream or milk  6 large eggs  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, more as needed.</p>
        <p>1. Butter a 12-by-4-by-4-inch loaf pan, and line with parchment paper. Line bottom of pan with bread, using four slices, trimming as necessary to fit. Dot with a quarter of the mascarpone (about 2 tablespoons), spreading evenly. Sprinkle with a quarter of the chives or herb puree. Top with a quarter of the fontina cheese (about  1/2 cup) and a quarter of the ham. This is one complete layer of the croque-monsieur. Using a spatula, press gently.</p>
        <p>2. Build four more complete layers, and cover evenly with a fifth row of bread. In a large bowl, combine cream or milk and eggs. Whisk to blend well. Strain through a sieve into another bowl, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>3. Very slowly, pour egg mixture over croque-monsieur, allowing bread to absorb liquid. Loaf pan should be able to hold all the liquid. Allow croque-monsieur to rest for at least 2 hours before baking; it may be covered and refrigerated overnight.</p>
        <p>4. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Cover loaf pan with a lid or foil, and place in a deep baking dish or roasting pan. Pour hot water halfway up sides. Bake until set, or until a toothpick comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool, then refrigerate until cold.</p>
        <p>5. Invert pan onto a platter, and remove pan and parchment paper. Slice croque-monsieur into  1/2-inch slices. Place 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat.  Gently brown slices on both sides. Repeat as needed. For hors d'oeuvres, browned slices may be cut into  1/2-inch sticks and skewered.  Skewers may be reheated on a baking sheet.  Yield: 6 to 8 servings, or about 24 hors d'oeuvres.</p>
