        <p>A married couple watched the debate here with a friend from Franklin Lakes over a dinner of ziti and sausage pizza, switching now and then to the Yankee playoff game.</p>
        <p>The couple, Robert Montemayor, senior vice president for BPI Communications, and his wife, Virginia Lujano, director of new media sales and marketing for Contentville.com, an Internet company, said they were leaning toward Mr. Gore before the debate. They were not swayed by the end.</p>
        <p>Their friend, Jim Salvato, who owns a telecommunications business, began the evening undecided about his vote, and ended it that way.</p>
        <p>At the start of the 90-minute debate, the three said they were impressed by the poise both candidates showed.</p>
        <p>''They both seem more at ease than I would have expected, for the first debate,'' Mr. Montemayor said. ''I think they told both of them to be more likable,'' Ms. Lujano said.</p>
        <p>But after less than 30 minutes, they said that Mr. Bush seemed more tense than his opponent. When the governor said ''it seems like the vice president is not right too many times tonight,'' the three looked at one another.</p>
        <p>''He's too nervous,'' Ms. Lujano said. At one point, she said Mr. Bush was being ''snappy.''</p>
        <p>During much of the debate, when the candidates went back and forth tearing down each other's plans, the three found their arguments unhelpful, as when each tried to insist that his plan on Medicare would be best for Americans.</p>
        <p>''You don't know who to believe,'' Mr. Salvato said. ''One guy says one thing, the other says no, he's lying.''</p>
        <p>They seemed most interested in the debate when the talk turned to RU-486, the abortion pill approved last week by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lujano gasped when Mr. Bush said, ''I believe abortions ought to be more rare in America.''</p>
        <p>And when Mr. Gore said ''I support a woman's right to choose,'' Mr. Montemayor nodded. ''That's the best thing he's said all night,'' he said, and Mr. Salvato agreed that the statement would win him a lot of votes with women.</p>
        <p>The trio thought both candidates were getting bogged down in too much detail about their opposing plans, but Mr. Montemayor thought Mr. Gore had more of a tendency to drone on.</p>
        <p>''You've got to give old Bush something, he sure is more brief and to the point in his answers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The three were a bit bemused with the way the candidates tiptoed over the issue of President Clinton's relationship with a White House intern and whether it should be a factor in this election, especially Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Just say it: 'I've got nothing to do with Clinton,' '' Mr. Salvato said.</p>
        <p>By the end, all three were mostly relieved the debate was over.</p>
        <p>''Bush gave a bland delivery,'' Ms. Lujano said. ''It wasn't from the heart.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Salvato, ''Al Gore was a better speaker, his delivery was better. I just wouldn't want people to base it on that, because to hear them, you don't know who to believe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Montemayor, who grew up in Texas, was also not persuaded to change his vote.</p>
        <p>''Nothing I heard tonight changed my mind, and that comes from a fellow Texan,'' he said, before switching back to the Yankee game.</p>
