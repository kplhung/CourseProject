      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial holds O Lost: A Story of the Buried Life, newly published original version of Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel, is distinctly different work, both historially and aesthetically; holds it represents his first intentions toward novel, but that version edited by Maxwell Perkins represents his final intentions</p>

        <p>Unlike most newly published novels, ''O Lost: A Story of the Buried Life'' comes with an introduction, a discussion of the manuscript and typescript, and a brief essay on editorial policy. That is because ''O Lost'' is the original version of Thomas Wolfe's ''Look Homeward, Angel,'' which first saw print in 1929 -- without any mention of its editor, Maxwell Perkins, or of the editorial policy at Scribners, where Perkins worked. It is hard to say how much two versions of a novel have to differ before they can be called different novels. But from a historical perspective, as well as an aesthetic one, these are indeed distinct works.</p>
        <p>In their essay on editorial policy, Matthew and Arlyn Bruccoli, the editors of ''O Lost,'' write, ''the rationale for this edition is to establish the text of 'O Lost' that should have been published in 1929 by Charles Scribner's Sons. . . .'' The word ''should'' in that sentence jumps at the reader's eye. The implication is obvious. When Perkins received Wolfe's typescript, the Bruccolis suggest, his job was to give it a light editing to correct obvious errors and establish consistency in spelling and punctuation. Then he should have set it up in print and sent it out into the world, otherwise unaltered. What Perkins did instead was work painstakingly with Wolfe on changes that cut the novel by some 66,000 words, or roughly 22 percent of its original length. Out of those changes arose the myths that still wreathe themselves around ''Look Homeward, Angel'' -- that it was as much Perkins's creation as Wolfe's and that Wolfe could manage only amorphous fictions.</p>

The word ''should'' in that sentence jumps at the reader's eye. The implication is obvious. When Perkins received Wolfe's typescript, the Bruccolis suggest, his job was to give it a light editing to correct obvious errors and establish consistency in spelling and punctuation. Then he should have set it up in print and sent it out into the world, otherwise unaltered. What Perkins did instead was work painstakingly with Wolfe on changes that cut the novel by some 66,000 words, or roughly 22 percent of its original length. Out of those changes arose the myths that still wreathe themselves around ''Look Homeward, Angel'' -- that it was as much Perkins's creation as Wolfe's and that Wolfe could manage only amorphous fictions.</p>
        <p>There is good reason to bring this version of Wolfe's greatest novel, based on a carbon copy of the typescript he sent to Perkins, lovingly into print at last. ''O Lost,'' after all, represents Wolfe's first and perhaps purest literary intentions toward the novel that became ''Look Homeward, Angel.'' But ''O Lost'' does not represent Wolfe's final intentions. ''Look Homeward, Angel'' does. That is an important distinction. An author's final intention is usually the basis for scholarly editions of literary works. When Wolfe first met Perkins, he was stunned, as writers often are, to find a reader who took him completely seriously. That in itself was enough to lead Wolfe to re-estimate and to revise ''O Lost,'' to rework his intentions in the light of his conversations with Perkins.</p>
        <p>Wolfe and Perkins have revolved around each other, like twin stars, for many years now. In some versions of the story, Perkins rescues Wolfe from drunken prolixity, and in others, Wolfe's youthful genius is betrayed, trimmed to coarse commercial shape, by Perkins. Yet most writers hope for what Wolfe found in Perkins, a reader with the desire to understand one's best work and the power to publish it as well. '' 'O Lost,' '' the Bruccolis write, ''is a greater work than 'Look Homeward, Angel.' '' That may well be. But if so, it is a criticism of Wolfe as well as of his editor.</p>
