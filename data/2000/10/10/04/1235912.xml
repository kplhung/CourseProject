        <p>Entering a new phase in its three-year-old effort to adapt to the growing role of the Internet in business computing, the International Business Machines Corporation said yesterday that its new computers from large mainframes down to personal computer-sized servers would all be marketed under a single family name -- eServer.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. also introduced the top of the line of the new eServer family, called the z900, which will take the place of the S/390 mainframe. I.B.M. said it would roll out 15 other computers by the end of the year, including ''p-series'' replacements for the current RS/6000 line of Unix servers, ''i-series'' replacements for the AS/400 computers sold mainly to medium-sized businesses, and the ''x-series'' which will take the place of smaller servers based on Intel processors, many of them currently marketed under the Netfinity names. Several i-series models actually began shipping in July, although they were not given their new eServer names until yesterday.</p>

        <p>Entering a new phase in its three-year-old effort to adapt to the growing role of the Internet in business computing, the International Business Machines Corporation said yesterday that its new computers from large mainframes down to personal computer-sized servers would all be marketed under a single family name -- eServer.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. also introduced the top of the line of the new eServer family, called the z900, which will take the place of the S/390 mainframe. I.B.M. said it would roll out 15 other computers by the end of the year, including ''p-series'' replacements for the current RS/6000 line of Unix servers, ''i-series'' replacements for the AS/400 computers sold mainly to medium-sized businesses, and the ''x-series'' which will take the place of smaller servers based on Intel processors, many of them currently marketed under the Netfinity names. Several i-series models actually began shipping in July, although they were not given their new eServer names until yesterday.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. also announced a variety of pricing, software products and service changes intended to give customers more flexibility and to provide a number of features, like the ability to use the Linux operating system, that would be common to all I.B.M. business computers. I.B.M. said it would spend $325 million to market the eServer concept.</p>
        <p>Investors were not impressed. After rising $5.31 Monday in anticipation of a bullish announcement, I.B.M.'s shares fell $7.25, to $110.56, yesterday on the Big Board. The shares are down about 18 percent since Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that the announcements reflected I.B.M.'s recognition that even though it had a commanding lead in mainframe applications for e-business, the major growth had been in smaller devices. I.B.M. has been losing ground to competitors like Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard in the overall server market in part because of competition among its different product groups.</p>
        <p>''They've decided that they can't win by allowing the competition to divide and conquer them,'' said Thomas J. Bittman, the lead I.B.M. analyst for the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. said that the changes were the latest developments in a three-year, $5 billion effort to adapt to a landscape where workloads and the variety of customers for computing power will be much more varied than in the traditional corporate world that I.B.M. once dominated.</p>
        <p>About $1 billion of that was invested in the z900, which is built around a new 64-bit processor and is capable, I.B.M. said, of handling 16 times the secured transactions of the nearest competitor. The z900 can be operated as if it were actually thousands of smaller servers, and new software allows it to quickly adjust where its capacity is deployed so that customers can make sure that the highest-priority applications are always being handled.</p>
