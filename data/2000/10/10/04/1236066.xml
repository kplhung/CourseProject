        <p>On several issues in the debate, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush stood on principles that have divided their parties for decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush favored large tax cuts, Mr. Gore more federal spending. Mr. Gore stood for abortion rights, Mr. Bush did not. Mr. Gore advocated expanding Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Bush pressed for partial privatization of the programs.</p>
        <p>They challenged each other's logic and budget numbers, offering a array of charges and countercharges, numbers and statistics, diplomatic catch-phrases, military jargon and economic theories. But the basic disagreement was over philosophy.</p>
        <p>Here is an examination of the candidates' positions on many of the issues that were points of contention in the debate and have been throughout the election year.</p>
        <p>On education, Mr. Bush stressed his plan to have students tested annually and to hold the public schools accountable if the students did not score well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore emphasized the money he would spend to hire teachers, raise teachers' salaries and give parents tax breaks to help offset the cost of college tuition.</p>
        <p>The governor talked more about local control of schools; Mr. Gore talked about how he would use federal funds to help reduce class size.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of favoring vouchers -- money to parents for private school tuition -- and said money should never be taken away from public schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not rise to the bait and avoided using the term vouchers. But he said would give parents money for private schools if testing showed over several years that the public schools were not serving the children adequately.</p>
        <p>Neither candidate accepted the idea that the only way to preserve Social Security is to raise taxes or cut benefits. Mr. Gore said he would continue the current benefit levels and provide government matching funds to help workers set up retirement accounts above and beyond Social Security. Mr. Bush would turn to a partial privatization of the system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of having no strategy for saving Social Security when the present funds expire. Mr. Bush would use about 15 percent of Social Security taxes to let workers set up private retirement accounts. The problem with the Bush plan, in Mr. Gore's view, is that insufficient money would be available for current benefit levels.</p>
