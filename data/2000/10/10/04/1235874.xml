        <p>IT'S hard to think of a blander name for a restaurant than the Dining Room. The Warholian blatancy of it seems almost subversive, and it's tempting to scrutinize the menu and decor to tease out conceptual layers within layers.</p>
        <p>It would be a search in vain. The Dining Room is guileless, sincere and unassuming, an attractive setting for attractive, intelligently conceived food. The menu, like the restaurant, is small, but it works some intriguing variations on familiar ingredients. In its design and its cuisine, the Dining Room proves that comfort does not have to be boring.</p>

        <p>IT'S hard to think of a blander name for a restaurant than the Dining Room. The Warholian blatancy of it seems almost subversive, and it's tempting to scrutinize the menu and decor to tease out conceptual layers within layers.</p>
        <p>It would be a search in vain. The Dining Room is guileless, sincere and unassuming, an attractive setting for attractive, intelligently conceived food. The menu, like the restaurant, is small, but it works some intriguing variations on familiar ingredients. In its design and its cuisine, the Dining Room proves that comfort does not have to be boring.</p>
        <p>The executive chef, Mark Spangenthal, who also runs the kitchen at the Screening Room in TriBeCa, tips his hand in an appetizer of seared foie gras with a thoroughly orthodox accompaniment of sauteed peach slices. It struck me as a perfectly pleasant start to the meal, when my roving fork turned over bits of semisweet pickled watermelon rind that kick-started the dish. The rind added just the touch of sweet acidity to help the peaches do their work of cutting through the fat in the foie gras. At the same time, it threw the sugary peach flavor into sharp relief.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spangenthal seems to have all sorts of ideas like that in his repertory. You could call them tricks, but they feel natural, like the sheets of spicy tasso ham he uses to wrap pan-roasted quail. The ham wrapper, cooked to a paper-thin crackle, makes a bright, racy counterpoint to dark quail meat and mushrooms. At the same time, there's nothing highfalutin about the dish, which rests on a neat pile of grits baked with Cheddar cheese. The chopped country salad, too, has modest pretensions, but it shames the competition in this increasingly popular category with an expertly juggled assortment of textures and flavors: bright bits of candy cane beets; pungent chunks of apple-smoked bacon; sharp, creamy goat cheese; slivers of cherries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spangenthal has brought one Screening Room appetizer with him, and no wonder. His pan-fried artichoke hearts, served on frisee with a lemon, garlic and coriander dressing, are simplicity itself, the outer leaves brought to a dark brown crunchiness flavored with toasted coriander seeds. They share some qualities with the finer grade of bar snack, not least the ability to trigger compulsive eating.</p>
        <p>The Dining Room has a small raw bar, whose spirit is nicely expressed in a three-dish sampler plate. A neat rectangular slab of tuna tartare makes a striking impression, iced on top with a cool slush of wasabi-fired cucumber. Thick, handsome slices of yellowtail are treated chastely, with nothing more than a squeeze of lemon and olive oil, a sprinkling of salt and a minimal garnish of arugula and basil. A generous ceviche of shrimp, scallop, squid and snapper rounds out the plate.</p>
        <p>There are appetizer restaurants, and entree restaurants. The Dining Room is an appetizer restaurant. The excitement subsides a little in the main courses, which are homey at heart, perfectly satisfying, but taken as a whole, not quite as clever as the starters. Good ingredients carry most of the load, notably in the powerfully flavored lamb, served with a light, custardy corn pudding, and a he-man portion of prime rib, bolstered by a side dish of sweetly braised rib meat, potato gratin and wild mushrooms.</p>
        <p>The wild card, an Asian-influenced dish of red snapper coated with a sweet-sour glaze and accompanied by candied ginger, flummoxed me. It seemed out of character in every way, right down to the Chinese black rice luridly described as ''forbidden rice.'' Braised striped bass was more like it, a gutsy, straightforward piece of fish surrounded by a hearty pan roast of clams and bitter greens in a tomato vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Thomas Hobbs, the pastry chef, is a good fit for the Dining Room. His desserts have an air of humility about them, a homey feel that makes them doubly pleasing when they veer off in unexpected directions. His pistachio souffle is a little moist and mushy for my taste, and a grilled peach touched with ginger lacked the lusciousness factor needed to sell such a simple idea.</p>
        <p>But two desserts fly right off the charts. A column of bread pudding, soaked in coconut milk, rests on a layer of tart crushed pineapple and then picks up the rich spice of ginger sorbet, poised atop a glassy sugar tuile. Chocolate caramel icebox cake is a simple compressed sphere, only a little denser than mousse, concealing pleasurable depths -- layer after layer of shortbread, chocolate-caramel mousse, molten caramel and meringue, swimming in a pool of caramel sauce and chocolate sauce.</p>
        <p>The designer, Larry Bogdanow, has pulled off a slick move, eliminating every trace of the very handsome two-level bistro that this once was, Trois Jean, and substituting an equally enticing but thoroughly American interior. On the ground floor, a handful of tables cluster near the front window to form a clubby dining area. Farther back, a small bar and sleek booths offer sanctuary to desperate smokers. The upstairs mood is a touch more formal, with fabric-lined booths that hark back to the golden age of train travel, and elegant dark-wood paneling on the ceiling. It's stylish without strain, which, come to think of it, is not a bad way to describe Mr. Spangenthal's relaxed American style.</p>
        <p>The Dining Room  **  [Rating: two stars]  154 East 79th Street (Lexington Avenue); (212) 327-2500.  ATMOSPHERE: A cozy two-floor town house with a sleek American design to match the inventive New American menu.</p>
