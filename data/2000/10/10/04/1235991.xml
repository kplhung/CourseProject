        <p>To think that Art Fowler's legacy lives on in the San Francisco Giants. That's Art Fowler, as in the old pitcher who in his post-playing life became Billy Martin's confidant, drinking buddy and pitching coach, a pitching coach who was perceived to be more drinking buddy than coach, a pitching coach of whom George Frazier, the former Yankees pitcher, said: ''I've been Fowlerized. I know how to throw a spitball now.''</p>
        <p>Dave Righetti has never said whether he learned the spitter from Fowler, but yesterday Righetti talked about the lesson he learned from Fowler when both worked for the Yankees.</p>

        <p>To think that Art Fowler's legacy lives on in the San Francisco Giants. That's Art Fowler, as in the old pitcher who in his post-playing life became Billy Martin's confidant, drinking buddy and pitching coach, a pitching coach who was perceived to be more drinking buddy than coach, a pitching coach of whom George Frazier, the former Yankees pitcher, said: ''I've been Fowlerized. I know how to throw a spitball now.''</p>
        <p>Dave Righetti has never said whether he learned the spitter from Fowler, but yesterday Righetti talked about the lesson he learned from Fowler when both worked for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''I learned how to let guys play,'' said Righetti, who is completing his rookie year as the Giants' pitching coach. ''I led the league in walks in '82, and Art handed me the ball and said, 'I ain't going to talk to you the rest of the year.' I said, 'What if I need your help?' But that's how Art was.''</p>
        <p>Righetti walked 108 in 183 innings in 1982. The following season, left alone by his pitching coach, he walked 67 in 217 innings.</p>
        <p>''We had some young guys who were leading the league in walks last year,'' Righetti said, turning the discussion to current events. ''I left them alone. What are you going to do? They're all young guys. They're going to be out there by themselves. You got to leave them alone a little bit. There's enough on these guys these days, the pressures, worrying about what do you got to do without watching it on ESPN or whatever, the home runs flying around. Basically, in the long run, you've got to let them play.''</p>
        <p>The corps of starters who helped bring the Giants to this point -- the first round of the playoffs against the Mets and the best won-lost record in the major leagues -- obviously responded to Righetti's coaching style. Each of the five starters won in double figures, only the fourth time -- the first since 1982 -- that a San Francisco staff gained that distinction. The team's 3.45 earned run average was the National League's lowest in the second half of the season. The season E.R.A., 4.21, was the fourth lowest, giving the team its best placement since 1989.</p>
        <p>''The way he's related to the players has been a big thing as far as our success,'' Russ Ortiz, one of the starters, said of Righetti. ''He said: 'You guys have the talent and the ability to be up here. I'm going to basically leave you alone. But if there's something that needs to be done, I'll step in when I need to step in.' He basically let us go. For me personally, I like that because I don't get all kinds of different things.''</p>
        <p>Righetti, Ortiz added, helped build confidence in the starters.</p>
        <p>''When we go out there, we need to believe in ourselves,'' the 26-year-old Ortiz said. ''From the very beginning, just the way he dealt with us, he was easy to get along with. That relationship just grew and grew during the year.''</p>
        <p>This is a pitching coach who didn't want to be a pitching coach.</p>
        <p>''I didn't grow up wanting to be a major league baseball player,'' Righetti said. ''I just wanted to have fun. Same with coaching. I never called up anybody. It was a fluke.''</p>
        <p>It was because of Al Leiter, his old friend and protege from their Yankees days. A resident of nearby Los Altos, Calif., Righetti innocently took his son to his first baseball game a couple of years ago. Righetti picked that game because Leiter was pitching.</p>
        <p>''It was the first game I saw from the stands since I was a kid,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Giants found out he had been in the ballpark and invited him back for another game. Then they invited him to work in their instructional league camp and from there invited him to work last season in their minor league system as a roving pitching coach for their three California teams.</p>
        <p>This season he replaced Ron Perranoski as the major league pitching coach.</p>
        <p>''I went to junior college to get a draftsman's degree,'' said Righetti, 41, sitting in the home team's dugout at Pacific Bell Park and tracing the start of his baseball career. ''I wanted to be an engineer. My buddies were going out for baseball. They said, 'Why don't you play?' Two months later I was drafted.''</p>
        <p>Righetti recalled how an old family friend, a former minor league teammate of his father's, told him he was going to be drafted.</p>
        <p>''It was 1977,'' Righetti said. ''Jimmy Carter was in office. There was something about Angola. I wasn't up on current events, but I knew they were going to bring the draft back. When he said, 'You're going to be drafted,' I thought I was going to the Army. That's not being funny. I really thought that's what he meant.''</p>
        <p>It was the baseball draft, though, and now Righetti is in his second baseball career. This postseason is the second for him, the first since, as a Yankee, he allowed one run in three games and 15 innings against Milwaukee and Oakland in 1981, then lasted only two innings in a World Series start against Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Righetti did not plan to tell his pitchers anything from that experience for their starts against the Mets.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to have a meeting to tell them what I think,'' he said. ''They know what to expect. They have their way to handle things. We'll see how things are going and how they react.''</p>
