        <p>European regulators are considering approving the proposed $20 billion combination of the music division of Time Warner Inc. and the EMI Group into a joint venture, a development that would remove the last major barrier in Europe to the acquisition of Time Warner by America Online.</p>
        <p>Industry officials said today that Mario Monti, the European commissioner in charge of competition issues, would reconvene an advisory group on Thursday that had rejected the deal, at Mr. Monti's urging, just a week ago.</p>
        <p>It appears to reflect a change of view among European regulators in the wake of new concessions proposed by Time Warner and EMI, which included an offer to sell the Virgin record label, with stars ranging from the Spice Girls to David Bowie.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Monti recommended that the advisory group, consisting of national regulators from European Union countries, reject the Warner-EMI deal because it would reduce the number of worldwide music distributors to four from five and could severely reduce competition in the industry.</p>
        <p>Soon after that meeting, held in private, Time Warner and EMI offered to sell Virgin. Up to that point, the companies had offered to sell some smaller record labels as well as EMI's European distribution and logistics operations.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Monti has not made his views known, people close to the European Commission, the European Union's administrative arm in Brussels, said that he would not go to the trouble of summoning regulators from their countries if he did not feel a need to change his recommendation.</p>
        <p>The deal between Time Warner and EMI is considered important both in its own right and in connection with Time Warner's much bigger combination with America Online, a combination valued by some estimates around $165 billion.</p>
        <p>By merging Warner Music and EMI, the company would control one of the world's biggest music distributors and wield enormous power with artists and retailers on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monti has been primarily worried about ''collective dominance,'' a situation in which a handful of music producers and distributors would control most of the worldwide music publishing industry. He has also been worried that Time Warner could cement America Online's position as the world's leading provider of online services by channeling its artists and albums onto AOL rather than to rival services and Web sites.</p>
        <p>European regulators let it be known last week that EMI posed the biggest obstacle to approval of the acquisition of Time Warner by AOL.</p>
        <p>When the national regulators met with Mr. Monti last week, he recommended blocking the EMI deal but suggested that the America Online venture could go forward if Time Warner dropped its plans for the music merger.</p>
        <p>Instead of doing that, Time Warner and EMI surprised the regulators by offering concessions that went far beyond early proposals. Though Virgin is merely one among many record labels owned by either Warner Music or EMI, it is a big company with a big stable of top-selling performers.</p>
        <p>Under the European Commission's rules, it must reach a final decision on the EMI deal by Oct. 18 and on the Time Warner-AOL combination by Oct. 24. The deadline for making entirely new compromises has passed, but companies periodically try to negotiate until the last possible minute.</p>
