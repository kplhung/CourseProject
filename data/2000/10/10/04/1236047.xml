        <p>YOU hear nothing like the fevered talk about an E-ZPass Series that filled the New York air at this time last year.</p>
        <p>Oh, sorry. You are probably more familiar with ''Subway Series'' as shorthand for the dreamy notion of a Yankees-Mets battle for the baseball championship of North America.</p>
        <p>Many sportswriters and columnists practically fall into a swoon at the mere sound of those words, Subway Series. They become unable to resist an urge to tell the young'uns to gather round and listen once more to hoary tales about a golden age when Giants (not to mention Dodgers and Yankees) walked the New York earth.</p>
        <p>On and on they go, tearily recalling the glorious autumn of 1956, when two New York teams last met in the World Series, when it was safe to sleep on the fire escape on warm nights, when players were working stiffs and not millionaires, when Don referred to Larsen or Newcombe, pitchers both, not Corleone.</p>
        <p>''Subway Series'' lingers so determinedly as New York's Holy Grail that it is easy to overlook how meaningless the phrase has become.</p>
        <p>Most Yankees and Mets fans these days live outside the five boroughs. Only one spectator in four takes mass transit to the ballpark. Nearly all the rest go by car, which is why E-ZPass Series is preferred here even if it may lose in romance what it makes up for in accuracy.</p>
        <p>Whatever you call it, the idea of a Yankees-Mets struggle for primacy does not seem to be igniting the New York imagination as it did a year ago at the start of post-season play. That may change. But for now New Yorkers seem resigned to the prospect that one team, maybe both, will fall quickly by the wayside. It is certainly hard to be cheered by the Yankees' recent performance, which may most charitably be described as miserable.</p>
        <p>In a sense, the next week or two will test New York fans as much as the ball clubs. Will New Yorkers rise to the challenge of defeat?</p>
        <p>Sports devotees here fancy themselves connoisseurs who are concerned only with displays of physical grace and talent. Bunk! What New Yorkers appreciate are winners. This city has none of Boston's or Chicago's affection for habitual losers. Even the great Mickey Mantle found himself booed when he wasn't hitting. New Yorkers will put up with any amount of loutish behavior as long as the boor comes through. Do the names Donald Trump and George Steinbrenner mean anything?</p>
        <p>Consider this example of local fandom. At Shea Stadium last week, a man was charged with throwing a bottle at John Rocker, the pitcher with the famously big mouth. Accompanying this fellow, and also charged in the incident, was a friend, Brian C. Peterson. Mr. Peterson, you will recall, is that fine young man who did prison time for manslaughter after dumping his newborn son in a trash bin.</p>
        <p>What, the comedian Chris Rock said the other night, are we supposed to think about a guy who can't forgive John Rocker for saying stupid stuff but has no problem hanging out with a baby-killer?</p>
        <p>FANS aside, the baseball post-season in New York has certain unvarying rhythms. One endearing element is the revival of chatter about a stadium for the West Side of Manhattan. Once again, true to schedule, City Hall has proposed a new field, saying it could be used for football or for the Summer Olympics in 2012.</p>
        <p>Some scoff at the thought of the Olympics coming to New York. But think about it. What was the most discussed feature of the just-completed Sydney Games if not the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs? With its many doctors and hospitals, New York can rightly bill itself as the steroid capital of the world. Is there a more natural place for pumped-up athletes to strut their stuff?</p>
        <p>Some skeptical New Yorkers suspect that what the mayor still wants -- always wants -- is for Manhattan to become home to his good friend Mr. Steinbrenner, who would love to take his Yankees out of the Bronx. That plan, however, seems as moribund as David Cone's right arm.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have enjoyed record attendance the last two seasons, putting the lie to Mr. Steinbrenner's past claims that fans will not go to the Bronx because they are afraid of the place or put off by congested roads around Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''There is no attendance argument -- it's over,'' said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president. ''If there's any problem, it's not the parking at the stadium. It's the pitching.''</p>
        <p>He has a point. And if that problem persists, New Yorkers can kiss an E-ZPass Series goodbye right now.</p>
