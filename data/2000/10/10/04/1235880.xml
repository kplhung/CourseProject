        <p>Is that caviar on my plate, or are you just trying to amuse me? If today's caviar prices are too high, one can pretend to spoon it up daily with whimsical plates that trick the eye.</p>
        <p>Realistic, almost three-dimensional renderings of large beluga, medium osetra or small sevruga eggs adorn the six-inch gold-rimmed porcelain plates. The portion on each appears to be partially eaten.</p>
        <p>The plates were designed by Odette de Bruniere of Austin, Tex., whose Russian mother was responsible for her love of caviar. ''I'm all American, but I have almost a genetic affinity for this luxury,'' she said. ''And I've always thought there should be fun plates to use for such serious food.''</p>
        <p>Ms. de Bruniere has painted porcelain dinnerware and serving pieces by hand for private clients since 1953. Her first caviar service, the inspiration for this set, was handmade many years ago as a New Year's Eve house gift. The plates here come in sets of six (two of each pattern) for $48 from the Williams-Sonoma catalog, (800) 541-2233.</p>
        <p>They're not just for dreamers, of course. For those who indulge in the real stuff, horn caviar spoons and glass bowls complete the service.</p>
