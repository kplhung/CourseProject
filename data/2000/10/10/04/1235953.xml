        <p>Saying that New Yorkers are being subjected to a visual assault by hundreds of oversized, excessively lit or illegal outdoor advertisements, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that his administration was supporting stricter sign regulations and much tougher penalties for anyone who ignored them.</p>
        <p>The new regulations -- which are already before the City Council and local community boards -- would limit the size of signs in many corridors near city highways and prohibit signs that are so bright that they disturb drivers and residents. They would also allow the city to move more quickly against violators, punishing them with fines as high as $25,000 and even allowing the city to take down illegal signs on its own.</p>

        <p>Saying that New Yorkers are being subjected to a visual assault by hundreds of oversized, excessively lit or illegal outdoor advertisements, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that his administration was supporting stricter sign regulations and much tougher penalties for anyone who ignored them.</p>
        <p>The new regulations -- which are already before the City Council and local community boards -- would limit the size of signs in many corridors near city highways and prohibit signs that are so bright that they disturb drivers and residents. They would also allow the city to move more quickly against violators, punishing them with fines as high as $25,000 and even allowing the city to take down illegal signs on its own.</p>
        <p>The moves come after a surge in the numbers and size of signs being affixed to city buildings, rooftops and water towers, among other spots, evidence of an industry that has grown rapidly in part because of new sign-making techniques and lighting technologies.</p>
        <p>The result, though, has been a more than doubling of complaints from residents in the last year about disruptive signs that in some neighborhoods fill the skyline with big, bold and sometimes clashing images.</p>
        <p>''It is something that the city, really, we have probably let go for too long,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday.  ''There will be many more restrictions. They will be enforced more severely. The illegal billboards will have to be removed.''</p>
        <p>The most important change in the regulations would be a prohibition on signs that exceed 750 square feet anywhere in a city manufacturing district, such as along the Long Island Expressway in Queens and just before the Midtown Tunnel entrance to Manhattan. Other areas where large numbers of problem signs have surfaced include along the Bruckner Expressway in the South Bronx, the West Side Highway near Chelsea and the West Village, as well as parts of SoHo. Illuminated or flashing signs could not exceed 500 square feet in the manufacturing districts.</p>
        <p>Currently, there is no limit on the size of signs in these areas and some are as large as 1,800 square feet, city officials said. Flashing signs would also be prohibited from piers or platforms along the city's waterfronts.</p>
        <p>To speed cases against violators, complaints would now be heard before the city's Environmental Control Board instead of in a criminal court, and outdoor advertising companies would have to register with the city. Companies that repeatedly violate sign rules could be temporarily banned from doing business in the city.</p>
        <p>Several City Council members have expressed support for the zoning and enforcement changes. Currently, the maximum fine allowed for violating the regulations is $5,000, but typically the fines are not more than $300 to $400, not much of a deterrent, officials said.</p>
        <p>''My district has become an advertising Mecca,'' said City Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn, a Democrat from Chelsea. ''Excessive advertising robs a neighborhood of visual open space.''</p>
        <p>But industry leaders are balking at the proposals. Timothy C. Stauning, president of New York Outdoor Group Inc., a trade association of outdoor advertisers, said he supported the efforts to strengthen enforcement measures. But he said the city was being too restrictive, suggesting that signs in manufacturing districts should be capped at about 1,200 square feet. ''The regulations as proposed go well beyond where they should,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The changes in the zoning regulations need approval from the planning commission and the City Council, while changes in regulations related to enforcement and penalties need City Council approval. The Times Square area, where the city encourages large, flashy signs, would be exempt from the new rules.</p>
