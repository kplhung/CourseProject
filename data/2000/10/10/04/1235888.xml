        <p>Isabelle Terrillon has sued her former employer, Nomura International, asserting that her superiors at the bank instructed her to wear short, tight skirts to work. Once, the lawsuit attests, they ordered her to strip to her underwear and give a man a massage during a business meeting.</p>
        <p>In a suit filed against Credit Suisse First Boston, a former employee, Philip Karam, who was born in Pakistan, says that Asian employees were referred to as ''curry.'' In an interview, Mr. Karam said that his bosses threatened to set fire to his apartment if he reported the comments to the personnel department.</p>
        <p>Nomura and Credit Suisse deny wrongdoing and are fighting the lawsuits. Ms. Terrillon, through her lawyer, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Sounds like the latest round of Wall Street mudslinging, right? Not exactly. Such discrimination suits, filed by employees working in the London offices of foreign and local companies, are part of a growing British penchant to litigate.</p>
        <p>The number of sexual and racial discrimination lawsuits filed with  Employment Tribunals in England and Wales for the year ended in June was 76 percent higher than the number filed five years earlier. Some of the more high-profile cases have been filed against firms in the City of London -- British for Wall Street -- the buttoned-down home of the pinstriped suit, and they are helping to reshape one of the last bastions of the white boys' club.</p>
        <p>Discrimination based on gender and race was outlawed in Britain 25 years ago. But it has been only in the last few years -- thanks, in part, to the cultural influence of America, where no problem is too small for the courts -- that Britons have begun suing with fervor. And anti-discrimination policies are likely to gain more teeth not just in Britain but throughout Continental Europe as a result of goading by two European bodies.</p>
        <p>The 15-country European Union ratified measures this summer, under Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that for the first time will provide a uniform legal basis to combat discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, religion, age or disability.</p>
        <p>Then there is the European Convention on Human Rights, drafted by the Council of Europe, a group founded to protect individual freedoms. All 41 member countries are required to sign it into law. The legislation is especially significant for Britain, which has no written constitution, because it will replace common law rights dating to the Magna Carta with a written bill. Legal experts are hailing the edict, which took effect in England on Monday, as the largest change to British law in three centuries.</p>
        <p>To Americans who have seen powerful companies of all stripes humbled by the class-action suit, Britain's legal coming of age may seem like small potatoes. But considering that many of these issues fly in the face of British tradition, which has more often been about duties than about rights, the changes are a huge cultural shift in Britain.</p>
        <p>''Before, if your boss harassed you, you had to accept it,'' said Martin McElwee, deputy editor at the Center for Policy Studies in London. ''Today, people realize they don't have to put up with that kind of behavior.''</p>
        <p>Some call it the Ally McBeal effect, and attribute the current overall rise in the number of lawsuits filed to an American culture that glorifies lawyers. American banks, which bought or built their way into the London markets during the liberalization effort of the 1980's, had some influence, too.</p>
        <p>''Given the emphasis in the U.S. on diversity issues, these topics were imported into the City in a way they never would've been'' without the United States presence, said Alexander Campbell, head of human resources for the London operations of UBS Warburg.</p>
        <p>His company and others have begun to take note. Five years ago, when Mr. Campbell joined the company, the investment banking arm of UBS A.G. of Switzerland, topics of race and gender were hardly discussed, he said. Today, the firm has created a new position, global head of diversity, to ensure that these issues are not brushed aside.</p>
        <p>''The costs of litigation if you get some of this stuff wrong is escalating significantly in the U.K.,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''Culturally we tend to follow the U.S. with a 5-to-10-year lag. We are becoming a more litigious society.''</p>
        <p>Much of the changes, however, would be mere lip service if they were not girded by the Convention on Human Rights and Article 13.</p>
        <p>Chris Myant, a spokesman for the Commission for Racial Equality here, expects the Human Rights Convention to reshape legal ideology. '''The thinking of the courts will shift from 'How can we be a barrier to people achieving their rights?' to 'How can we be a springboard?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Article 13, meanwhile, will usher in more specific changes, such as shifting the burden of proof from claimants to defendants and allowing third parties, like the British Equal Opportunity Commission, to sue on behalf of individuals. Currently, such groups can offer legal aid to claimants but cannot file suit directly on their behalf.</p>
        <p>But cowboy litigation American-style is unlikely to run wild in Britain anytime soon. The Employment Tribunals operate under rules that prohibit class-action suits, and the tribunals, which are similar to the American arbitration system, are where discrimination cases in England are tried. Moreover, remuneration is based largely on a claimant's lost wages. This means that the awards usually fall short of the million-dollar judgments common in the United States, where a combination of compensatory and punitive damages is often granted. And people bringing cases before the tribunals are required to bear the cost of their legal fees, which in many cases exceeds the settlement, employment lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Some barriers are slowly falling. Remuneration caps were removed in 1994, at which time the maximum compensation for discrimination cases was $:11,000 ($15,800). As women and minorities earn higher wages, the potential for greater compensation increases. Another part of the settlement, called injury to feelings, which is meant to redress psychological damage, has also increased from an average of $:5,000 five years ago to as much as $:30,000 ($43,710) today.</p>
        <p>And so cases like Kay Swinburne's are becoming more common. Ms. Swinburne was earning $:300,000 ($432,000) a year as an investment banker at Deutsche Bank's London office until the sexist comments by her boss -- among other things, he accused her of sleeping with a client -- caused her to resign. She won her discrimination case before a tribunal. Her subsequent out-of-court settlement in March was $:1 million ($1.44 million), according to newspaper reports. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Despite such results, some people, including Mr. Karam, who says he will never be able to get another job in the City after suing Credit Suisse, remain skeptical about the larger impact of discrimination suits. ''It's great to have all these things on paper,'' Mr. Karam said. ''But to see them filter through to real life is another matter.''</p>
