        <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers report for Internet Advertising Bureau says Internet advertising revenue in second quarter totaled $1.2 billion, up 127.3 percent from a year ago, but up just 8.8 percent from first quarter of 2000 (S)</p>

        <p>Advertising spending on the Internet grew robustly in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period, the Internet Advertising Bureau said yesterday, though the growth rate slowed markedly from the first quarter. The bureau, along with PricewaterhouseCoopers, reported that ad revenue from April through June totaled $2.1 billion, up 127.3 percent from the second quarter of 1999, but up just 8.8 percent from the first quarter of 2000. ''We looked at the market correction in the dot-com world as a cause for concern,'' said Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the bureau, adding that ''the traditional advertisers have stepped in to fill the gap'' from the loss of ads from online marketers. He said Internet ad revenue for the full year could total $8 billion to $10 billion, compared with $4.6 billion in 1999.</p>
