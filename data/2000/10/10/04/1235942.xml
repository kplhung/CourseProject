        <p>The Rangers trimmed their roster today for the season opener on Saturday, and it was no surprise that Pavel Brendl, Manny Malhotra and Jamie Lundmark were cut. The real shocker was not announced by the team.</p>
        <p>According to an executive of a National Hockey League team, the defenseman Stephane Quintal was placed on waivers.

        <p>The Rangers trimmed their roster today for the season opener on Saturday, and it was no surprise that Pavel Brendl, Manny Malhotra and Jamie Lundmark were cut. The real shocker was not announced by the team.</p>
        <p>According to an executive of a National Hockey League team, the defenseman Stephane Quintal was placed on waivers. If he is not claimed within 48 hours, he could be recalled, traded or sent to Hartford, the Rangers' American Hockey League affiliate, where he would be the highest-paid player in the minor leagues. Quintal, who turns 32 on Oct. 22, is in the second year of a contract that will pay him approximately $10.7 million over the next four years.</p>
        <p>Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, would not comment on whether Quintal was placed on waivers, but intimated that the makeup of his team could be significantly changed by Friday, the day before the Rangers face the Thrashers in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>If Quintal is not recalled from waivers, it could open a permanent spot on the roster for someone like Mike Mottau.</p>
        <p>When asked if he would hesitate to send a highly paid veteran to the minors, Sather was coy.</p>
        <p>''I certainly wouldn't say no to that,'' Sather said. ''I don't want to keep anybody here who doesn't deserve to be here.''</p>
        <p>Moving Quintal, or sending him down, would be the first sign that the Rangers are serious about overhauling the team.</p>
        <p>Sather admitted that it was difficult cutting Brendl, Lundmark and Malhotra. ''They're all young guys,'' he said. ''They all really want to play here. And they all think they are ready.''</p>
        <p>Brendl and Lundmark, both 19, were returned to their junior league teams, while Malhotra, 20, was reassigned to Hartford, where the Rangers would like him to learn to play left wing.</p>
        <p>''He's going to be back this season,'' Sather said of Malhotra.</p>
        <p>Brendl and Lundmark, however, will have to wait until next season to make the team.</p>
        <p>''We kept expecting them to jump out and do the things we were told they could do,'' Sather said. Even though Brendl had a goal and four assists in his final two preseason games, it was not enough.</p>
        <p>''The Brendl decision was really tough,'' Coach Ron Low said. ''He put some numbers up on the board the last two games. But, consistency-wise, I didn't think he showed enough through camp.''</p>
        <p>Sather agreed.</p>
        <p>''Brendl, to me, looked like he wasn't quite ready to be here yet,'' Sather said. ''Even in the last two games, he wasn't dominating play or leading the play. He has great instincts. But he wasn't quite physically or mentally strong enough to play at this level.''</p>
        <p>That, of course, was something Brendl did not want to hear.</p>
        <p>''It was tough for him to swallow,'' Sather said.</p>
        <p>Brendl expressed frustration that he had to return to juniors. He said he would not have minded being sent to Hartford.</p>
        <p>''I should play with men, not kids anymore,'' Brendl said, adding that he was surprised, and disappointed, that he played in only four exhibition games.</p>
        <p>Malhotra was surprised and disappointed at his demotion.</p>
        <p>''I felt my camp was what they wanted,'' said Malhotra, who played left wing only once in the preseason. ''That he wants me to move to a different position is a twist to the situation. But I'll do it. Still, one of my thoughts was, if he had that in mind, I could have been working on it all camp instead of the last day.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Coach RON LOW said that BRIAN LEETCH (groin) is questionable for Saturday's season opener in Atlanta. If Leetch is not ready, MIKE MOTTAU will take his place in the lineup, if Mottau and the Rangers can agree to a contract before Wednesday's deadline. . . . JASON LaBARBERA, 20, will start the season as KIRK McLEAN's backup. MIKE RICHTER, still recovering from knee surgery, practiced with his teammates for the first time Tuesday and said he is on schedule to come back in the third week of the season. . . . Low said he would try VALERY KAMENSKY on MARK MESSIER's right wing to start the season, even though Kamensky has played left wing his entire career.</p>
