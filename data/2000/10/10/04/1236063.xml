        <p>On several issues in the debate, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush stood on principles that have divided their parties for decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush favored large tax cuts, Mr. Gore more federal spending. Mr. Gore stood for abortion rights, Mr. Bush did not. Mr. Gore advocated expanding Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Bush pressed for partial privatization of the programs.</p>
        <p>They challenged each other's logic and budget numbers, offering a array of charges and countercharges, numbers and statistics, diplomatic catch-phrases, military jargon and economic theories. But the basic disagreement was over philosophy.</p>
        <p>Here is an examination of the candidates' positions on many of the issues that were points of contention in the debate and have been throughout the election year.</p>
        <p>The candidates clashed early and fiercely over how to provide prescription drug coverage to older Americans. Mr. Bush accused Mr. Gore of using ''Medi-scare tactics,'' while Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of advancing a plan that offered little or no help to most Medicare beneficiaries and was far too reliant on private insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush advocated transforming the government health insurance program into a largely private marketplace in which the elderly are given a fixed amount of money each year and can purchase the plan of their choice. He noted that the traditional Medicare program would be preserved and that the elderly could stay with the program if they chose.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's plan, like Mr. Bush's, would make it substantially more expensive for those who want to stay with traditional Medicare.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Bush's proposal, health plans would be required to offer drug coverage. Low-income seniors would get immediate help, he argued, under a four-year, $48 billion program of grants to the states.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that this plan would be limited to the low-income elderly, and that 95 percent of older Americans would ''get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the  first four or five years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore advocated adding a standard drug benefit to the Medicare program: it would be voluntary, available for a monthly premium beginning at $25 and gradually doubling over a decade. It would cover about half the costs of drugs up to a cap that gradually rises to $5,000. He proposed a 50 percent federal subsidy of the premiums; Mr. Bush proposed 25 percent.</p>
