        <p>Major League Baseball said yesterday that it would consolidate various advertising assignments, with billings estimated at $20 million to $30 million, by naming the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, to handle those tasks for the 2001 season.</p>

        <p>Major League Baseball said yesterday that it would consolidate various advertising assignments, with billings estimated at $20 million to $30 million, by naming the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, to handle those tasks for the 2001 season.</p>
        <p>''We want to have one central communications program that evolves from the brand down,'' said Jacqueline Parkes, senior director for advertising at Major League Baseball in New York. ''FCB presented us with a concept we felt does just what we needed to do.''</p>
        <p>FCB San Francisco will assume duties for image campaigns and public service announcements that had been handled by Vigilante in New York, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the B Com3  Group. It will also take over duties for consumer products like licensed merchandise that had been handled by the Lord Group in New York, a joint venture of Dentsu and the Young &amp; Rubicam unit of the WPP Group.</p>
        <p>FCB San Francisco will also handle the reintroduction of the Major League Baseball Web site.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a 10-week review that had been narrowed to FCB San Francisco and two other finalists, the New York offices of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA unit of the Omnicom Group, and McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
