        <p>Before Yugoslavia's elections on Sept. 24, most Western leaders expected that President Slobodan Milosevic and his coalition would win -- through intimidation of opponents and voters, repression of independent media and simple theft of votes.</p>
        <p>They were wrong. Though the elections were full of irregularities, they were not massively unfair.

        <p>Before Yugoslavia's elections on Sept. 24, most Western leaders expected that President Slobodan Milosevic and his coalition would win -- through intimidation of opponents and voters, repression of independent media and simple theft of votes.</p>
        <p>They were wrong. Though the elections were full of irregularities, they were not massively unfair. The opposition won overwhelmingly in local elections and took many seats in the federal parliament (though not an absolute majority), and its candidate for the president, Vojislav Kostunica, a law professor, defeated Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>This last victory is of historic importance. Mr. Milosevic came to power in Serbia in 1987, and in the late 1980's a large majority of Serbs accepted him as the national leader. In the early 1990's his popularity began to decline, and for the last several years he has enjoyed the support of, at most, one-quarter of the Serbs. Yet, because of the opposition's inability to unite, no one could defeat him. Now, the miracle has happened.</p>
        <p>But Slobodan Milosevic would not be Slobodan Milosevic if he did not pull out a new trick just when his bag of tricks should be empty. He acknowledges that Mr. Kostunica received more votes but claims that it was less than the 50 percent plus one necessary to win, so that a second round of elections must take place this Sunday.</p>
        <p>With the same self-confidence they had before the elections, Western leaders now say that Mr. Milosevic is wrong and that Mr. Kostunica is the outright winner. They are correct. Indeed, there is no reason to doubt several independent institutions in Belgrade that show Mr. Kostunica won more than 50 percent of the votes and that the second round of elections is unnecessary. It is obvious that the state electoral commission has manipulated the results to reduce Mr. Kostunica's edge by several percentage points. Even Mr. Milosevic's ally, the leader of the extreme nationalist Radical Party, has congratulated Mr. Kostunica on his victory.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kostunica and the democratic opposition are making a mistake in boycotting the second round of elections and calling on the people to engage in mass protests to force Mr. Milosevic to acknowledge defeat. Though many have responded to these appeals and Serbia seems to be in revolutionary turmoil, this turmoil is unlikely to turn into a revolution. The strikes and other mass protests hurt ordinary Serbs more than Mr. Milosevic and his clique, who have endured them many times before. The strikes cannot continue for long. Admittedly, after demonstrations in the winter of 1996 and 1997, Mr. Milosevic conceded the defeat of his party in local elections. But now much more is at stake.</p>
        <p>The turmoil in Serbia has thus far been nonviolent. Yet many Serbs are afraid of civil war, and this is one reason why the participation in the protests and strikes is not greater. Others do not understand what the fuss is all about: Mr. Milosevic does not say he won, but just wants another round. For many people, winning by a small percentage of votes is not as significant as it would be in stable democracies where precise and objective counting of votes has been routine for many generations.</p>
        <p>By agreeing to the second round of elections, the opposition would not be accepting the results of the state electoral commission. Nor should it stop people from protesting. It is enough for the opposition to say that it does not fear the ballot box and has full confidence that the Serbian people will again vote for its candidate. All analyses show that Mr. Kostunica would score a victory even greater than the one before.</p>
        <p>I believe Mr. Milosevic has neither the will nor the ability to steal as many votes as Mr. Kostunica is certain to win, and if he were somehow to do that and proclaim victory, the anger of the people would be enormous. Protests and strikes would be much larger than they are now.</p>
        <p>If the opposition really does boycott the elections, Mr. Milosevic will proclaim himself a winner. His legitimacy would be shakier than ever before, and he would not be able to consolidate his power again. But the democratic transition would also be postponed, and Serbia, which has lost more than a decade to war, would lose even more time.</p>
