        <p>The Grand Union Company, the grocery chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday for the third time in six years.</p>
        <p>The company said the filing, in United States Bankruptcy Court in Newark, would permit it to conduct business as usual and to pay suppliers and employees while it continues to look for a buyer.</p>
        <p>Grand Union, which operates 197 stores in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont, hired Merrill Lynch last March to help arrange a sale. Grand Union's chief financial officer, Jeffrey Freimark, said that it had several suitors and that the bankruptcy filing ''does not change at all the sale process or Merrill's role.''</p>
        <p>Facing a highly competitive market increasingly dominated by national chains like Wal-Mart, Grand Union, based in Wayne, N.J., has struggled in recent years. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 1995 and again in 1998. It emerged from bankruptcy protection in August 1998 but has continued to lose money. For the quarter ended July 22, the company lost $51.7 million and posted sales of $658 million, compared with $687.3 million in the period a year earlier. Sales in stores open at least a year, a standard industry measurement of health, declined 2.7 percent. For the fiscal year that ended in April, the company reported a loss of $307.9 million on sales of $2.2 billion. The company's stock, which closed at 11 cents yesterday, traded at $10 at the start of the year.</p>
        <p>As a result of the bankruptcy, the company said it expected to close a ''small number'' of unprofitable stores, but it did not say where those might be. ''We are in the process of reviewing and identifying those stores,'' Mr. Freimark said. He added, ''it is possible there will be layoffs in conjunction with a limited number of store closings.''</p>
        <p>In August, the company laid off 170 employees, mostly from its headquarters. The company has about 13,000 employees.</p>
        <p>Customers in the Northeast will eventually see lower prices if a sale goes through, said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of Reach Marketing, a marketing consulting firm in Westport, Conn. ''The stores will probably be sold off individually to the 10 chains and independent grocery cooperatives in the New York and New England areas'' -- for example, Price Chopper in Albany and Marketbasket in New England. ''And the companies likely to buy a Grand Union are much more efficient and have much lower prices on everyday shelf items.''</p>
        <p>There will be two sets of losers, Mr. Flickinger predicted. ''About 20 percent of the stores need to be closed,'' he said, ''because they are under such pressure from supercenters that they are an uneconomic proposition.'' And union workers would probably lose jobs to chains that were nonunion shops, he said.</p>
        <p>Grand Union also said it had obtained, subject to court approval, a $60 million line of credit from Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., one of its lenders. Nevertheless, Moody's Investor's Service downgraded all of Grand Union's debt ratings.</p>
        <p>In its Chapter 11 petition, the company listed assets of $749.5 million and debts of $804 million as of July 22. C&amp;S Wholesalers of Vermont was listed as the largest of nearly 1,000 unsecured creditors, with a $7.8 million claim.</p>
