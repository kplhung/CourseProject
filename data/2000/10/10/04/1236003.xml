        <p>The changes proposed by Mr. Lind would substitute one electoral in equity for the current one, which is winner-take-all in most states. If a state's electoral votes were divided proportionately based on the popular votes of the candidates in that state, as Mr. Lind suggests, the vote of, say, each resident of California, a populous state, would still be worth substantially less than each Wyoming resident's vote.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''If a Swing State Cares, It's an Issue,'' by Michael Lind (Op-Ed, Oct. 2):</p>
        <p>The changes proposed by Mr. Lind would substitute one electoral in equity for the current one, which is winner-take-all in most states. If a state's electoral votes were divided proportionately based on the popular votes of the candidates in that state, as Mr. Lind suggests, the vote of, say, each resident of California, a populous state, would still be worth substantially less than each Wyoming resident's vote.</p>
        <p>A better solution would be for individual states to enact legislation requiring that all of the state's electors vote for the candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote of the country as a whole. A state could provide that this requirement would become effective only if and when a similar law was enacted by states whose electoral votes constitute a majority of the Electoral College.</p>
        <p>Once such legislation were passed in a sufficient number of states, the vote of the Electoral College would become nothing more than a formal reaffirmation of the popular vote.</p>
