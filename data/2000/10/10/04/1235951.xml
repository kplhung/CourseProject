        <p>American Home Products said yesterday that it had agreed to pay the federal government $30 million after regulators found that the company had repeatedly violated manufacturing regulations at two of its drug factories.</p>
        <p>Both American Home and regulators at the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that they did not think that any of the company's products on pharmacy shelves were defective. But company executives said that they would examine some of the manufacturing records to ensure that there were no problems with the products. If problems are found, they said, the company might be forced to recall some products.</p>
        <p>Products made at the two factories, in Marietta, Pa., and Pearl River, N.Y., included a flu vaccine called Flushield; several childhood vaccines, including a new product called Prevnar; Wydase, a drug used in eye surgery; and a snakebite antivenom product.</p>
        <p>Under its agreement with the government, American Home will hire consultants to conduct detailed inspections at the two factories. The company must correct any problems that the consultants find or pay further fines.</p>
        <p>The agreement between American Home and the government is still subject to approval by the United States District Court in Knoxville, Tenn. It is similar to the F.D.A.'s action last year against Abbott Laboratories. Abbott agreed to pay $100 million to settle accusations that it failed to follow manufacturing regulations in making hundreds of medical test kits.</p>
        <p>The government took the legal action against American Home after inspections found repeated problems in the factories' manufacturing processes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bruce Burlington, senior vice president for regulatory affairs at Wyeth-Ayerst, the company's prescription drug subsidiary, said that the company regretted that it did not move more aggressively to change its manufacturing processes after it first received warnings from the F.D.A. as early as 1995.</p>
        <p>''We weren't moving as fast as the F.D.A. was looking for us to,'' Dr. Burlington said. ''The firm, up and down the hierarchy, takes this extremely seriously.''</p>
        <p>In June, officials from the Justice Department seized hundreds of doses of prescription drugs and vaccines that were made at the factory in Marietta. American Home said yesterday that it had agreed to destroy those products, which included two generic antihistamines and adult vaccines for tetanus and diphtheria. Dr. Burlington said that the company did not think the products were defective, but had determined that it would be less costly to destroy them rather than trying to prepare them for sale.</p>
        <p>American Home temporarily closed parts of the Marietta factory in December after the F.D.A. had begun what the company said was a routine inspection. The F.D.A. said yesterday that its inspections of the Marietta factory in 1995, 1996 and 1998 had all found manufacturing violations. Those problems resulted in the F.D.A.'s issuing two warning letters to American Home and also demanding that company executives meet with regulators to talk about the problems.</p>
        <p>The manufacturing problems have forced American Home to delay shipments of its flu vaccine. The company said yesterday that it planned to begin shipping the flu vaccine in mid-October, or about two months later than in previous years.</p>
        <p>And in July, the company sent letters to medical clinics nationwide saying that it had halted production of its snakebite serum and was taking measures to control the product's distribution. The serum is the only one available that can neutralize toxins from three types of poisonous North American snakes: rattlesnakes, cottonmouths and copperheads.</p>
