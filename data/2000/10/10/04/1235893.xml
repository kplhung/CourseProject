        <p>Japan's large manufacturers turned markedly more confident about business conditions the last three months despite adverse foreign exchange rates, rising oil prices and a weakening stock market, a widely followed quarterly Bank of Japan survey showed today.</p>
        <p>It was the seventh consecutive quarter that the survey, known as the tankan, showed a rise in confidence among the leading industrial Japanese corporations, reaching the highest level in more than three years.</p>
        <p>The trend was stronger than had been expected, but the survey also showed weaknesses. In contrast to the optimism of large corporations, many smaller Japanese businesses remain gloomy about the future.</p>
        <p>Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency, and Kiichi Miyazawa, the finance minister, suggested in their comments about the survey today that they were not overly impressed.</p>
        <p>''I am modestly satisfied with the overall result of the tankan,'' Mr. Miyazawa said. ''The delay in the recovery among small companies has caught my attention.''</p>
        <p>An index based on survey results of big companies rose from a reading of 3 in the June survey to a 10 in the latest survey. That means 10 percent more big companies are optimistic about business conditions than are pessimistic.</p>
        <p>The survey also showed, however, that the same index would probably only rise to 11 for October through December. ''I don't want to put it too strongly, but we may be seeing a deceleration in industrial activity going forward,'' said Michael Naldrett, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. ''There's no sign of that in the data so far, but everyone is concerned about next year.''</p>
        <p>Although evidence has accumulated in recent months that Japan's economy is recovering from prolonged weakness, there is some worry that soaring oil prices and the yen's relative strength could hurt economic growth.The stock market, which has fallen 16 percent this year, barely moved on the news of the tankan survey.</p>
        <p>Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Warburg (Japan), said that even a meager increase in expectations for the current quarter could evaporate by the time the next poll is taken. ''It seems to me that there is a risk that the index for large manufacturers may see a dip next time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shirakawa and others noted that the strong exports that have been one of the chief propellants of the Japanese economy's latest effort to recover are likely to decline. Recent statistics from purchasing managers in Europe and the United States suggests a slowdown in demand, and inventories in industries like electrical machinery, iron and steel have been creeping up lately, economists said.</p>
        <p>The tankan showed that big manufacturers nonetheless increased their spending plans, projecting an average 6 percent rise in capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending March 31. In the previous survey, they were projecting a 4.6 percent increase.</p>
