        <p>George Steinbrenner was cloistered in a Manhattan hotel suite working on undisclosed business yesterday, instead of sitting behind the first base dugout here watching the Yankees search for themselves.

        <p>George Steinbrenner was cloistered in a Manhattan hotel suite working on undisclosed business yesterday, instead of sitting behind the first base dugout here watching the Yankees search for themselves. Steinbrenner declined to explain why he was not with his enigmatic two-time defending champions, but he was adamant about defending them after their three-week drought.</p>
        <p>''Hey, man, we're the New York Yankees,'' Steinbrenner said in a telephone interview. ''We're not scared. That word isn't in our vocabulary. We might be a little tired and we might have struggled a little, but you can bet your behind that we aren't scared.''</p>
        <p>Before Steinbrenner had his second cup of coffee yesterday morning, he read a back-page headline in The New York Daily News that called the Yankees ''scared.'' So Steinbrenner hastily ordered his public relations firm to spit out a brief, bizarre statement that the Yankees are not scared. It wasn't really necessary to respond to a headline based on part of a quote from Chuck Knoblauch; Steinbrenner should have been smarter and a lot less sensitive.</p>
        <p>But nothing irritates Steinbrenner more than the idea that his Yankees, his $112 million Yankees, are fretting. The Yankees looked pathetic in losing their last 7 games and 15 of their last 18 games. Most of the time, they looked more sluggish than scared. Knoblauch said Monday that he doubted the Yankees could simply turn on a switch in the postseason, adding, ''That scares me a lot.''</p>
        <p>Maybe Steinbrenner is at least a little concerned now. Roger Clemens did not protect a 2-0 lead and the Yankees lost to the Athletics, 5-3, in Game 1 of the division series. The first game in any three-of-five-game series is crucial, but this game was especially important for the Yankees because they had to prove to themselves and to the A's that they are not the team that played like the Newark Bears in September. Clemens was supposed to deliver, but he faltered mightily in another postseason game.</p>
        <p>''I think that he can become a leader for us tonight,'' Steinbrenner had said. ''I think he's going to give us a big performance.''</p>
        <p>Clemens fell shy of Steinbrenner's hopes, making the Yankees think more about how the season ended. Steinbrenner called the Yankees' revealing crawl through September confounding, while comparing it to a company that had a poor quarter. But it is not that easy. If I.B.M. struggles, it remains open and continues selling computers for the rest of the year. If the Yankees continue struggling, they go home this year.</p>
        <p>Just like Torre, Steinbrenner said that the postseason was a new season for a team that is used to being here. But unlike every team except the Braves, it is different for the Yankees. Steinbrenner's team is not interested in simply getting to the World Series. In George's world, the Yankees have to win another ring or they will have failed.</p>
        <p>''We don't have to win,'' Steinbrenner said. ''No team has to win. But I have confidence in them. We've made moves and I think they've worked. We're not scared.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner can say whatever he wants, but, if the Yankees do not win a third straight title, he will react. There will be changes. Lots of changes.</p>
        <p>As confident as Steinbrenner claimed to be, there are decisions that the owner has not yet made that will obviously be influenced by what happens in the postseason. If the Yankees win it all again, the changes will not be as drastic. If the Yankees do not, several players could have a new baseball address.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill is not signed after the season, and he has admitted that he is surprised by the Yankees' failure to discuss his future. Jeff Nelson can be a free agent and wants to pitch for Seattle. Denny Neagle's chances of returning, despite the price the Yankees paid the Reds to acquire him, have probably vanished because of his awful pitching. Steinbrenner expressed confidence in Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez, then paused and added, ''I even have confidence in Neagle.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner's fascination with the Angels' first baseman, Mo Vaughn, could escalate because Anaheim is poised to field offers. and Tino Martinez has made himself expendable with a disappointing season. Scott Brosius' paucity of offense is a concern. General Manager Brian Cashman's status might be more tenuous than anyone's, because Steinbrenner will need a scapegoat if the Yankees fail, and it won't be Torre.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner allowed Cashman to complete the moves that brought eight new players to the Yankees, the most players with major league experience ever added to a defending champion. Steinbrenner was so angry last month about Knoblauch's elbow injury that he questioned whether Knoblauch was afraid to return from the injury because he was afraid to play through his throwing problems. The owner also berated Nelson and another reliever, Mike Stanton.</p>
        <p>After vowing that he will be at Yankee Stadium for Game 3, Steinbrenner explained that he needed to hang up the phone and return to a meeting. Before he put the receiver down, he was asked to predict what might happen with the Yankees in October. Steinbrenner did not sound scared before Clemens and the Yankees lost, just a little cautious and a little optimistic.</p>
        <p>''I have confidence in my manager and in my team,'' Steinbrenner said. ''I really do.''</p>
