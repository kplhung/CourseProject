        <p>On the first day of the preseason, before the first practice of the new feel-good era, the Nets were twice visited by the injury curse today like a somber rite of fall.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the Nets learned that the team's leading rebounder, Jamie Feick, will undergo surgery Thursday to remove a calcium deposit on his left Achilles' tendon. Team doctors evaluated him this afternoon, but were not able to determine how long he will be sidelined.</p>
        <p>Feick averaged 9.3 rebounds and 5.7 points off the bench last year in 27.7 minutes a game. ''It's one of those blows you don't expect,'' Coach Byron Scott said. ''He played great in scrimmages last week and was grabbing rebounds every minute, showing me things that would be helpful to the team.''</p>
        <p>Without Feick, the Nets have to rely on the free agent Aaron Williams, who averaged 5 rebounds for the Wizards last season, Jim McIlvane and Evan Eschmeyer, a second-year player, neither of whom averaged more than 3.5 rebounds last season.</p>
        <p>As if that news were not inauspicious enough, the shooting guard Lucious Harris has a hernia and will also undergo surgery Thursday. Harris, who at one point this summer could have been the Nets starting 2-guard had not Kendall Gill signed again, will be out six to eight weeks and miss the first month of the season.</p>
        <p>Feick's injury flared up over the last few days during informal scrimmages. He had complained of pain in his Achilles' tendon, something that had irritated him last season, but he missed just one game last year and that was because of stomach flu.</p>
        <p>For the snakebitten team, the sudden loss of key reserves was unbelievably believable. ''Yeah, that's the thing with the Nets,'' Gill said. ''You always can expect injuries with us.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the Nets lost 272 total player games due to injury, including all 82 Jayson Williams had hoped to play. But leg and knee injuries forced him to retire. Every starter missed games and only the backup Johnny Newman played every game. The Nets began camp expecting shooting guard Kerry Kittles to miss most or all of this season rehabilitating from knee surgery.</p>
        <p>To replace Harris, at least temporarily, the Nets signed the 27-year-old guard Kevin Ollie of the University of Connecticut, who played with four N.B.A. teams in three years, including 50 games with the Philadelphia 76ers last season. The Nets signed Ollie to a nonguaranteed contract and he participated in tonight's session.</p>
        <p>Harris had been feeling a protrusion which would come and go throughout the summer, until team doctors told him Monday he would need surgery.</p>
        <p>As much as Feick's athleticism fits in with Scott's new up-tempo and defensive style, Harris was to add significant depth. He played in 77 games, started 11, and averaged 6.7 points and 19.6 minutes last year. His shooting percentage was 42.8 percent and 33 percent from 3-point range, higher than Gill's, although Gill was at small forward. Now Gill is pleased to be returning to his natural position this season due to Kittles's injury.</p>
        <p>But inconsistent outside shooting was already a worry for Scott before yesterday. ''I'm a little bit more concerned now than I was,'' Scott said. ''We have one down we know who can shoot the ball and do some other things. We're just going to rely more on other guys.</p>
        <p>''You hate to see that happen with two guys who we expected to be here,'' Scott added. ''But then I thought, 'Okay, we got to keep going, you've got to go with what you have.' ''</p>
        <p>He did that immediately, driving his players through running drills at the start of the morning practice. Before the night session, a special guest arrived: Scott's Laker backcourt mate, Magic Johnson who spoke to the players. ''He wants them to take pride in being a New Jersey Net and that's what's been missing,'' said Johnson, alluding to Scott. ''Now they have a coach who will instill that in them, and instill winning. He's working them like they've never been worked before. Byron Scott is going to have the New Jersey Nets in the best shape of their lives.''</p>
        <p>Johnson was in the area overseeing his theaters in Harlem.</p>
        <p>The rookie Kenyon Martin and the free-agent signee Williams both withered under the pace yesterday, Williams bothered by bleeding toes that needed draining. Martin was unprepared for the intensity and said that at the end of practice he felt tightness in his surgically repaired right knee. ''I'm going to play regardless,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even Gill was breathing hard. ''It was the first tough practice that I kind of struggled through and I'm in great shape,'' Gill said. ''We needed that the first day. It's going to be a great year if we work like this.''</p>
        <p>Gill shot the ball well today according to Scott, an encouraging sign on a day when his backup faces surgery.</p>
