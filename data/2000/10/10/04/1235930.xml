        <p>The Nasdaq composite index had its worst one-day point loss since late July yesterday, as a wide swath of technology stocks, led by Oracle, had big losses.</p>
        <p>Traders and analysts said the Nasdaq sell-off began in midafternoon, shortly after the Federal Reserve  policy makers said they had voted to leave short-term interest rates unchanged.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite closed at 3,455.83, down 113.07 points, or 3.2 percent. Before the Fed announcement, the index was up as much as 1.4 percent.</p>
        <p>It was the biggest one-day decline in the index since July 28, and its eighth drop in the last nine sessions. The last time the composite closed lower was on May 31, only a week after hitting its low for the year at 3,164.55.</p>
        <p>In its statement, the Fed said that while the pace of economic growth had moderated, tight labor markets and rising energy prices remained potential inflation threats. Without saying so, the Fed implied that it would not be moving to lower short-term rates anytime soon.</p>
        <p>The announcement was a disappointment to some traders, but hardly a surprise. Most analysts had expected the central bank to keep policy unchanged.</p>
        <p>Still, stock prices started to slide after the announcement.</p>
        <p>''Any kind of incremental news is seen as a reason to sell,'' said Rob Cohen, co-head of block trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>Rumors that Oracle would not meet its revenue numbers in the current quarter also hurt and prompted a wide sell-off in business-to-business Internet stocks.</p>
        <p>Shares of the Oracle, which held a meeting with analysts in San Francisco yesterday, fell $9.25, to $69.50. Oracle was the third-most actively traded stock yesterday. Since the end of August, the shares have declined 24 percent.</p>
        <p>Other market indexes were narrowly mixed.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.61 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,719.74. Gains in so-called old-economy stocks like DuPont, Alcoa and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing more than offset big declines in I.B.M. and Microsoft.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dipped 9.77 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,426.46. In addition to Oracle, the index was hurt by big losses in EMC and Sun Microsystems.</p>
        <p>The S.&amp; P. technology index, meanwhile, fell 53.78 points, to 1,813.95, a new low for the year.</p>
        <p>Jim Paulson, chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management, said the sell-off in technology stocks was likely to continue.</p>
        <p>''There have been almost continual dot.com problems since March,'' he said, ''and those haven't been addressed. Now, the big companies are having trouble, and their stocks are breaking down. It's one thing to have a dot.com meltdown when the economy is growing at 6 percent, as it was earlier this year. But it's another when the economy is growing at 3 percent or thereabouts.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, it was a good day for old-line cyclical stocks.</p>
        <p>DuPont gained $2.75, to $44.38. Alcoa, which reports its third-quarter numbers tomorrow, gained $2.44, to $26.94. And 3M gained $2.31, to $94.</p>
        <p>But it was a very bad day for Xerox. And Microsoft hit a new 52-week low.</p>
        <p>After the close of regular trading on Monday, Xerox said it would report its first quarterly loss in 16 years. The stock, which has been in a downward spiral for some time, fell $3.94, to $11.38.</p>
        <p>Microsoft fell $2.56, to $56.56. The stock is down more than 51 percent so far this year.</p>
