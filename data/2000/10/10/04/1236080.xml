        <p>DORSCH-George. The History of Art Department at F.I.T. is grieved to announce the death of our friend and colleague, who was born July 2, 1936 and died on September 15. A beloved and inspiring teacher at F.I.T. since 1968, Professor Dorsch served as chairperson of the department from 1990 to 1994 and oversaw its growth from its inception in 1989, particularly fostering the areas of East and West Asian art, modern architecture, and medieval art. He opened these and other worlds to many students who will mourn him as deeply as do the members of the department and the F.I.T. community.</p>
