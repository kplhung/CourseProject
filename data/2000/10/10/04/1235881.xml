        <p>The power of music swept people away when a group called Janie Brendel and Friends presented ''An Evening of Brahms'' on Saturday night at St. Mark's Church. Brahms wrote passionate music, and some dancers, choreographers and musicians yielded themselves wholeheartedly to its passion.</p>
        <p>In Zvi Gotheiner's ''Andante, Ma Moderato,'' Suzanne Gardner, Gerald Casel and Ms. Brendel seemed intoxicated by a spell cast by the great theme and variations movement from the String Sextet in F (Op. 118).</p>
        <p>Mr. Casel watched Roxane D'Orleans Juste and Ms. Gardner curl about each other at the start of Ze'eva Cohen's ''Two Songs.'' Then, as if pushed by the music, he ran, fell and was cradled by the women. Left alone in the second song, Ms. Juste dashed back and forth across the space.</p>
        <p>Stefa Zawerucha filled ''White Ginger,'' her solo for Ms. Brendel, with almost voluptuous-looking bendings and twistings to a movement from the Piano Trio in C (Op. 87).</p>
        <p>Peggy Baker's ''Her Heart,'' a solo to four piano intermezzos, choreographically sent Ms. Brendel running with mounting fervor. Sometimes she left the space while the music played on, only to return. With each fresh entrance she appeared to be the music assuming a new corporeal shape. At the end of the solo, Clifton Taylor's lighting made the church's stained-glass windows glow. The dancing and the music glowed as well.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baker was scheduled to dance a solo of her own and in a piece by Doug Varone but was prevented from doing so by an injury. Instead, Mr. Varone and Ms. Brendel offered his ''Care,'' a duet in silence in which they portrayed frail people supporting each other on the church's altar steps.</p>
        <p>The program also included the Romanze in F (Op. 118, No. 5) and a movement from the Piano Quintet in F Minor (Op. 34), both played without dancing. John Gavalchin served as musical director and pianist. The other musicians who helped make the program a pleasure were Conrad Harris and Pauline Kim, violinists; David Bursack and Kirsten Johnson, violists; Alberto Parrini and Pitnarry Shin, cellist, and Ivy Frenkel, soprano.</p>
