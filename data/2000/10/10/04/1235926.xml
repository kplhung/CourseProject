        <p>Canada held a state funeral for former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau today, ending five days of national mourning for the flamboyant intellectual who led the country through one of its most tumultuous periods.</p>
        <p>Thousands lined the streets of Montreal, the largest city in the French-speaking province of Quebec and the hometown of Mr. Trudeau, for the largest state funeral in Canada's history. Many Canadian and foreign dignitaries, including former President Jimmy Carter and President Fidel Castro, attended a Roman Catholic Mass inside the 19th-century Notre-Dame basilica in Montreal's old quarter.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a friend and disciple of Mr. Trudeau's, was the first speaker during the two-hour service. The last and most emotional one was Mr. Trudeau's eldest  son, Justin, 29, who urged Canadians not to abandon Mr. Trudeau's vision of a Canada unified under its English and French ancestries. That vision  elevated Mr. Trudeau above other Canadian politicians, but it has become frayed from the realities of politics and an increasingly restless Quebec.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trudeau served as prime minister for most of the period from 1968 to 1984. After stepping down, he  spoke out on a few memorable occasions against a new generation of political leaders who no longer share his views of Canada.</p>
        <p>''He came back to remind us of who we are and what we're all capable of,'' Justin Trudeau said, switching effortlessly between English and French, as his father used to do. ''But he won't be coming back anymore. It's all up to us, all of us, now.''</p>
        <p>In the days since Mr. Trudeau died on Thursday, at 80, after bouts with prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease, a reflective mood has swept much of the country as Canadians weighed his legacy.</p>
        <p>Outside Quebec, Mr. Trudeau was remembered as the person who carved a larger international role for a country often eclipsed by its southern neighbor, and he was remembered as having kept Canada together by defeating separatist forces in Quebec.</p>
        <p>In Quebec, though, many French-Canadians have recalled Mr. Trudeau with mixed emotions. If he made Quebecers proud for having one of their own in such a visible role, he was also the one who thwarted their nationalistic dream. It was a measure of French Quebec's ambivalence toward Mr. Trudeau that government buildings in the provincial capital lowered their flags in respect only after a notable half-day delay.</p>
        <p>And yet today, inside the 19th century neo-Gothic church, family, friends, political allies and foes, as well as ordinary Canadians, gathered for a final farewell. The lines in the plaza and streets outside the basilica, swarming with crowds that had begun forming in the early morning, thickened as the start of the 11 a.m. Mass approached.</p>
        <p>''Trudeau had a great vision for Canada -- that's why there are so many people here today from all over,'' said Guy Bougie, 71, a retiree and a French-Canadian, who was identifying the arriving dignitaries for Barbara Ahuja, an English-speaking resident of Ottawa who had come to Montreal today for the funeral.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ahuja said, ''I don't think there's any other politician who affected Canadians the way Trudeau did.''</p>
        <p>In a province where Quebec's fleur-de-lis flag dominates, flags of Canada were unfurled spontaneously from the windows of buildings surrounding the basilica. The flags fluttered in the mild winds. Intermittently, the sun pierced through the clouds and, shining from behind Notre Dame's western tower, bathed the crowds in front of the basilica in an autumnal warmth.</p>
        <p>''He was what we wanted all of us to be,'' Mr. Chretien said as he entered the church. ''He will be remembered as the first and greatest of the prime ministers of the new Canada.''</p>
        <p>Finally, just before 11 a.m., Mr. Trudeau's family arrived: his former wife, Margaret, and their sons Justin and Sacha, 27, followed by Mr. Trudeau's daughter, Sarah, 10, and her mother, Deborah Coyne, a constitutional lawyer. Mr. Trudeau's youngest son, Michel, died two years ago in a ski accident, and his father was said never to have recovered from the loss.</p>
        <p>After a short drive from City Hall, the hearse carrying a coffin draped in the Canadian flag stopped in front of the basilica. As Notre Dame's bells filled the air eight police officers hoisted the coffin up the stone steps, accompanied by honorary pallbearers, including Mr. Carter and Mr. Castro, who were later seen speaking briefly to each other.</p>
        <p>Just before the coffin was taken inside the basilica, the pallbearers halted. On instructions given by Justin Trudeau, a 10-year-old girl chosen randomly from the crowd, named Isabelle, laid a single red rose atop the coffin. Mr. Trudeau had often worn a single rose in his lapel and, since his death, his signature flower has been selling briskly at flower shops across Canada.</p>
