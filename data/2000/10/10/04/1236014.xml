        <p>LIKE Alice in Wonderland, the Yankees suddenly found themselves in a weird place last night. That is, leading in a game. After all, they hadn't been ahead in a ball game for what must have seemed to them like 40 years, though it was only since Sept. 25, when they briefly went ahead of the Tigers.</p>
        <p>So it was hardly surprising last night when they gave up their 2-0 lead in the fifth, and went behind by 4-3 in the sixth, on the way to a 5-3 loss to the Oakland Athletics in Game 1 of their American League division series. Being on top on the scoreboard obviously gave the Yankees vertigo. The A's, for their part, a young, aggressive, confident team, were less than awed by the two-time defending world champions.</p>

        <p>LIKE Alice in Wonderland, the Yankees suddenly found themselves in a weird place last night. That is, leading in a game. After all, they hadn't been ahead in a ball game for what must have seemed to them like 40 years, though it was only since Sept. 25, when they briefly went ahead of the Tigers.</p>
        <p>So it was hardly surprising last night when they gave up their 2-0 lead in the fifth, and went behind by 4-3 in the sixth, on the way to a 5-3 loss to the Oakland Athletics in Game 1 of their American League division series. Being on top on the scoreboard obviously gave the Yankees vertigo. The A's, for their part, a young, aggressive, confident team, were less than awed by the two-time defending world champions.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, meanwhile, played a respectable game, which, after what they've gone through in the last three weeks, is wild praise.</p>
        <p>While their ace, the stubble-bearded Roger Clemens, failed to hold the lead, even suffering the embarrassment of throwing a wild pitch to allow a runner to score from third, it was still a close game, none of those 17-2 or 15-3 routs they were growing accustomed to.</p>
        <p>In fact the Yankees came into the game with huge question marks. Was this the end of the line, and would the A's become the New Bay Bombers and send the Old Yankees back to the Retirement Home that Ruth Built?</p>
        <p>Right now, the jury is still out. The Yankees continued to have inconsistent hitting, and their pitching remains short of prodigious, and the A's pulled off a double steal with the Yanks asleep at the switch. Nonetheless, they were in the ballgame. They have lost the opening game of a postseason series before and still gone on to win it.</p>
        <p>And to a man they had said that the past was not prologue, that the playoffs are a new season, but they have hardly established that as fact.</p>
        <p>Let us return for a moment to that dreary piece of Gotham history: it was deep into September and the Yankees were playing as though someone were perpetrating a practical joke on them. It was as if they opened a door and a bucket of water fell on their heads. They took another step and a floor board smacked them in the nose. They turned to get out of there and walked into a wall.</p>
        <p>They were inches from clinching the American League East title but couldn't consummate. And they came into the last weekend of the season with the possibility that they might not even make the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''I called a team meeting and gave them a talk to try to relax them,'' Joe Torre, the Yankee manager, recalled. ''Then they went out and got bombed the next two nights. So I said, 'Guys, since I got you so stimulated in my last talk, I'll do it again.' ''</p>
        <p>Through what was a period unprecedented in the annals of House of Horrors baseball, Torre tried to maintain his sense of humor, stopping short of the tactic used by Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, when his team went into a slump. Valentine donned a fake beard. ''I didn't have to do that,'' the swarthy Torre said. ''I already have a beard.''</p>
        <p>Not only did the Yankees' vaunted pitching suddenly collapse; so did their only slightly less vaunted hitting. ''It looked like everybody they threw at us was Walter Johnson,'' the Yankee coach Don Zimmer said. And, it appeared, everybody the Yankees threw at people was Charlie Brown. And this against lowly Tampa Bay and Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Despite all this, the Yankees, by virtue of a good start, managed to win the East but lost home-field advantage. They were staggering. No team had ever entered postseason play with such a run of bad tidings. From Sept. 13 on, the Yankees endeavored to establish the worst record in baseball -- 3-15, with seven straight losses at season's end.</p>
        <p>And then the Yankees opened the playoffs against the team that had the best record in baseball since Sept. 13, 14-4.</p>
        <p>''We had become a tense team in trying too hard to clinch the division title,'' Torre said. ''But once we were in the playoffs, after the Red Sox lost, I felt the team in the last two games starting to be loose again.''</p>
        <p>The A's, however, were playing even looser. ''They know no fear,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Or as right fielder Paul O'Neill said, ''They're a runaway train, and we've got to figure out a way to stop them.''</p>
        <p>But now the A's were leading by 5-3, with their ace reliever, Jason Isringhausen, on the mound and two outs and none on in the ninth. Scott Brosius, the last forlorn hope of the Yankees, grounded to short for a routine final out.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, after having ballooned early, returned to that increasingly familiar feeling: deflation.</p>
