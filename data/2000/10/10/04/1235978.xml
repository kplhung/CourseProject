        <p>Ideally, all three leaders of Nassau County's embattled government say, they want to clean up the county's fiscal mess together and restore its pride. The trouble is, they have yet to sit in a room -- just the three of them -- to discuss it.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the state board overseeing the county's finances, frustrated by the bickering, told them to do just that. And when they do, they will see how deeply divided they truly are.</p>
        <p>For starters, the three factions have wide differences over how much to raise county property taxes, from not at all to 12 percent or higher. On police spending, one side wants to give uniformed officers a 22 percent pay raise over five years, while another wants to freeze their salaries. Some officials back sweeping layoffs of county employees; others do not.</p>
        <p>''At some point in the next three to four days, you are going to see a major explosion here in the Legislature,'' said Darren Bloch, the chief of staff to Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat who is the presiding officer of the County Legislature. ''And that explosion is going to be where the rift between the two factions of the Legislature lie.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the rift between two Republicans: Peter J. Schmitt, the  minority leader of the Legislature, and Thomas S. Gulotta, the three-term county executive.</p>
        <p>''I would like the county executive to act like the chief executive officer of the county and to help us put together a budget that is balanced,'' Mr. Schmitt said today. ''The only message I would send the county executive is: ticktock, time is fleeing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said of Mr. Schmitt: ''His constructive and positive input, rather than his derogatory remarks, could have been helpful.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, the state-appointed oversight board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, urged all three sides to start working together as it released a blistering report that rejected Mr. Gulotta's plans for balancing the budget in the next four years. The board told the three leaders, Mr. Gulotta, Ms. Jacobs and Mr. Schmitt, that they had less than a month to revise the plans. If they fail, it said, the board will seize control of the county's day-to-day operations.</p>
        <p>The three vowed to cooperate. But it is becoming clearer day by day that they have fundamental differences on how to erase the more than $300 million deficit the county faces by 2004.</p>
        <p>In the four-year budget proposal he submitted Sept. 15, Mr. Gulotta called for fee increases, the elimination of aid to the county's towns and cities and spending cuts in certain services, including the county's subsidy for Long Island Bus. He also proposed laying off more than 350 county workers, both union and nonunion employees, and raising taxes roughly 4 percent next year and 3 percent in each of the next three years.</p>
        <p>''It is a tough, hard-hitting budget that doesn't make everyone happy,'' Mr. Gulotta said today. ''But it accomplishes the objective of ensuring the county's fiscal health.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats, who won a slim legislative majority in November,  believe that a larger tax increase -- perhaps as much as 12 percent next year -- may prevent many of the  layoffs, which they say would leave roads unplowed and parks untended. They have raised questions about whether Mr. Gulotta's idea to withhold $50 million in aid to the county's three towns and two cities is feasible.</p>
        <p>''I will cut to a point,'' said Ms. Jacobs, the Democratic leader. ''But when we forget who we are, when we forget the responsibility we have to the residents of this county to not decimate this county, then we may as well pack up and go home.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans in the Legislature like to describe themselves as bit players lately, though their members are needed to override any vetoes by Mr. Gulotta. They have opposed raising property taxes at all, saying that with school taxes shooting up each year, residents cannot afford any more.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Republicans support deeper spending cuts. As a starting point, Mr. Schmitt said he would like to freeze the wages of all county employees, a move he said would save the county $28 million next year. He would limit spending on social service programs to the minimum levels set by state law, trimming an estimated $10 million next year.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Schmitt wants the county to consider consolidating or even eliminating certain departments, and privatizing other operations, such as the county's golf courses, beaches and Office of Cultural Development.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of things you can do, but it can't be done without the department heads and the department heads take orders from the fourth floor,'' he said, referring to Mr. Gulotta. ''No one is exploring what we can stop, and what we can do without.''</p>
        <p>One thing is clear from Mr. Gulotta's budget plans: he is aiming to protect the county's law enforcement officers.</p>
        <p>He has proposed steep raises for county police officers and detectives, as well as for county correction officers, in a trio of proposed contracts that would raise costs nearly $200 million over seven years. Both Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature -- and on the state board -- agree that the pay raises are unfair and politically impossible.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Gulotta said he has wrung concessions from the three unions, county lawmakers and members of the state board question some of those concessions, such as the elimination of Flag Day as a paid holiday, because they are already accounted for in this year's budget.</p>
        <p>Still, all three leaders agree that to avoid a state takeover, they will need to reach a consensus very soon.</p>
        <p>''I need a partner,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''I need either the Republican legislators, or three of them, or I need the county executive. In the real world, that is the bottom line.''</p>
