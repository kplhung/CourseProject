        <p>Legion are the young American novelists who have moved to Paris in the belief that this muse-city would release their innate talents. And for a good number of them it did.

        <p>Legion are the young American novelists who have moved to Paris in the belief that this muse-city would release their innate talents. And for a good number of them it did. Far fewer, though, are the American poets who have settled here, almost as if they were fearful that this city's legendary powers of seduction would erode their identity as Americans, perhaps even weaken their resolve to become poets.</p>
        <p>C. K. Williams, the New Jersey native who won this year's Pulitzer Prize for poetry, knows all about these dangers. When he first came here in the mid-1950's as a 20-year-old student and aspiring poet, Paris was the most exotic place he had ever known. But after he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania to move here, the strangeness of the city proved too much for his inchoate writing skills. Five months later he went back to college to learn his craft.</p>
        <p>Thirty years later, when he and his French wife, Catherine Mauger, finally did make their home here, Mr. Williams felt that it was now safe for him to be an American poet in Paris, that at 50 his cultural defenses were well in place. Yet soon he was worried. Exposure to Paris made him feel distant from the United States. So his solution was to return home to teach writing for a semester every year, first at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., then at Princeton University.</p>
        <p>''I started to feel I was getting too far from my roots,'' recalled Mr. Williams, 63, who now keeps homes in Princeton and Paris. ''I didn't want to be an expatriate. My poetry is so involved with the substance and texture of American life that if I'm trying to talk about social and political and even emotional realities, and I am not there, immediately there is a barrier between me and the reader. There is an assumption that I am not committed, which I am.''</p>
        <p>This twin existence has served him well. Since he first moved to Paris in 1985, he has gained more recognition in the United States. ''Repair,'' his eighth book of poems, won him the Pulitzer Prize and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Poetry last spring. But already, in 1987, his collection of poems ''Flesh and Blood'' had won the National Book Critics Circle Award. (Both books were published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.)</p>
        <p>For five months a year he lives an American life, albeit hardly a typical one, that enables him to hear the language, feel the mood, observe the politics of the United States. Paris then offers a different perspective, a distance that gives him ample cause to meditate on, and worry about, the direction and values of his native land.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, it has to be said, is a worrier, ''not a pessimist,'' he insists, ''but a worrier.'' But that already suggests a mellowing from the anger that first earned him literary renown in the late 60's and early 70's as a vociferous antiwar poet. His poem ''In the Heart of the Beast,'' about the killing of student protesters at Kent State and Jackson State Universities in 1970, begins challengingly: ''this is fresh meat right mr nixon?''</p>
        <p>''At first all I wanted to do was to write poetry; I was oblivious to politics,'' he explained over coffee in the Cafe de Flore in the Left Bank neighborhood of St.-Germain-des-Pres. ''But in the 1960's it was impossible not to think about the Vietnam War, and I really responded strongly. The emotion that really drove me was indignation at the absurdity of it all. When my daughter was born in 1969, that drove me off the edge, the fact wars were going on, and people were killing children. I was in an incredible fury about the world.''</p>
        <p>The style as well as the content of his poetry reflected this anger: short sentences, staccato phrasing, minimal punctuation, occasional expletives, urgency. The emotional outpouring, however, drained Mr. Williams. After publication of his collection ''I Am the Bitter Name'' (Houghton Mifflin) in 1972, after the breakup of his first marriage, he fell into a depression, ''a combination of divorce depression and poetry depression and post-book depression,'' as he put it. He even thought of abandoning poetry and trying his hand at film directing.</p>
        <p>But he was ''saved,'' to use his word, by changing the form and tone of his poetry, specifically by adopting a stylistic device, long lines, that many critics consider the principal innovation of his poetry.</p>
        <p>''For a long time I had been writing poetry that leaves everything out,'' he said. ''It's like a code. You say very little and send it out to people who know how to decode it. But I then realized that by writing longer lines and longer poems, I could actually write the way I thought and the way I felt. I wanted to enter areas given over to prose writers, I wanted to talk about things the way a journalist can talk about things, but in poetry, not prose.''</p>
        <p>''Along with this discovery,'' he went on, ''was the realization that I was too close to polemical, that you can't just yell at people. So I tried to put the tensions that I wanted to talk about in this other context, as more of a subliminal sociopolitical message, so people would reach the same conclusions but wouldn't feel they were being shouted at.''</p>
        <p>After he met Ms. Mauger in 1973 and began spending summers in Paris, his poetry remained rooted in the United States, yet by the late 70's it was also less site- and issue-specific. His voice still sounded distinctly American, but his concerns were both more personal and more universal. Today his poems often begin with some everyday experience, feeling or observation, then move toward a deeper reflection on life or love or violence or sorrow.</p>
        <p>At any one time, he said, he has notes for or drafts of 50 or 100 poems, yet if some take days or weeks to complete, others take years. ''Repair'' includes a long-line poem, ''King,'' inspired by an incident 30 years earlier after the murder of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Williams watched two white policemen provoking ''a tall, handsome black man, bearded, an artist,'' as he walked to a memorial service.</p>
        <p>Black man, white man: I can still see us, one standing stricken, the other stalking away;</p>
        <p>I can still feel the anger, feel still because it is still in me my helpless despair.</p>
        <p>''When it happened, I tried to write a poem about it, and there just wasn't a way to do it,'' recalled Mr. Williams, who is known to friends as Charlie. ''It took me years to figure out, what am I trying to say? A poem can't just be interesting. It has to have some passionate meaning somewhere in it. Or it has to create a passion. And until you do that, you haven't got a poem.''</p>
        <p>While he works constantly on his poetry, there are times when the peripheral status of poetry in the world of letters seems to rankle him. ''You speak to people, and you don't know if they hear you, how many hear you,'' he said. ''And if your feeling is that you have to be heard by a massive number of people in order to have some meaning, then obviously you don't want to be a poet.''</p>
        <p>Yet a feeling of isolation is nonetheless present in a recent poem called ''The Poet,'' two stanzas of which read:</p>
        <p>Poets try to help one another when we can; however, competitive we are, and we are,</p>
        <p>the life's so chancy, we feel so beleaguered, we need all the good will we can get.</p>
        <p>Whether you're up from a slum or down from a carriage, how be sure you're a poet?</p>
        <p>How know if your work has enduring worth, or any? Self-doubt is almost our definition.</p>
        <p>This may explain why Mr. Williams has also branched out, translating Sophocles's ''Women of Trachis'' and Euripides's ''Bacchae,'' writing a poetry text for a documentary film called ''Criminals'' and venturing into theater with an unpublished play, ''The Jew,'' set in 19th-century Germany. This year he also published ''Misgivings: My Mother, My Father, Myself'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), a prose memoir about his parents' marriage and his painful relationship with them.</p>
        <p>Yet there may also be something about Paris that has given him this freedom, freedom to abandon his long lines in some of the poems in ''Repair'' and now to write poems ''almost like ballads, very stylized, very formal.'' Perhaps he has finally found what he was unconsciously seeking here as a young man, a space without strings attached.</p>
        <p>''The first poet whom I was intimately attached to was Baudelaire, and I think a lot had to do with the way he experienced Paris as a sort of stranger in the city,'' Mr. Williams reflected. ''Someone who is intimate with it but at the same time is not part of it. Intuitively I felt Paris was the place where I could do that.'' But it also took him the best part of four decades to do so.</p>
