        <p>SPAIN: TRUCKERS BLOCK BORDER TO FRANCE -- Spanish truckers blocked the two main border crossings into France for the second day running as part of a wave of protests to press for cheaper fuel. Taxi drivers staged a 12-hour strike in most Spanish cities and fishermen along the southern Mediterranean coast stayed in port in separate actions intended to force the government to cut fuel taxes, which can account for up to 60 percent of the price at the pump.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: 477 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SEIZED -- The police arrested 477 Moroccans and sub-Saharan Africans who were trying to get into the country after crossing the Strait of Gibraltar.

        <p>NETHERLANDS: GLOBALIZATION PROTESTS -- Anti-globalization protesters threw smoke bombs and tried to breach police barricades outside a conference in Amsterdam attended by the World Bank president, James Wolfensohn.

There were no reports of injuries.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: ACCORD WITH CHILE -- Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he had reached agreement with his Chilean counterpart, Soledad Alvear, reinforcing ties between the two countries that were strained by the arrest in England of the former dictator Augusto Pinochet. ''Prominent in the agreement is our commitment to make sure there is steady exchange at the highest level between the leaders of our countries,'' Mr. Cook said. General Pinochet was held under house arrest in England for 17 months while lawyers unsuccessfully sought to extradite him to Spain to stand trial on torture charges dating from his 1973-1990 rule.</p>

        <p>CANADA: LOBBYISTS SUE -- With Prime Minister Jean Chretien considering calling an election in November, the National Citizens Coalition, a lobby group, has challenged in a Calgary court a new federal law that limits lobby group spending. Under the law, adopted in May, the maximum a lobby group may spend to support a candidate or a party is $100,000 nationally, or $335 per parliamentary district.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: 'OIL FOR FOOD' PROCEEDS -- Iraq has sold almost $35 billion in oil in the last four years under the United Nations ''oil for food'' program, organization officials said. In addition to medicines and foods, Iraq has bought oil tankers, irrigation systems and oil field equipment. But the United States continues to block some Iraqi contracts, including $1.89 billion for civilian goods amounting to 14.5 percent of all current orders.</p>

        <p>IRAN: KHATAMI CHOICE REJECTED -- Parliament refused to approve the nomination of a close supporter of President Mohammad Khatami to the job of post and telecommunications minister, despite a personal plea from the president. Although the president has a large majority in the Parliament, legislators turned down Nasrollah Jahangard because of his ''inexperience'' and ''lack of familiarity'' with the issues of the ministry.</p>

        <p>KUWAIT: BORDER ALERT -- Kuwait put the police on alert along its border with Iraq to confront what it said was the massing of Iraqi intelligence agents. The acting defense minister and interior minister, Sheik Mohammad Khaled al-Sabah, inspected operations on the frontier, where hundreds of stateless Arabs have been gathering on the Iraqi side. Kuwait fears that those Arabs could sweep across the border on orders from Baghdad. Tension between Kuwait and Iraq has been mounting since August, when Baghdad marked the 10th anniversary of its invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf war.</p>

        <p>ETHIOPIA: SELASSIE REBURIAL -- The late Emperor Haile Selassie will be reburied on Nov. 5 in a ceremony aimed at restoring the dignity of a monarch who died 25 years ago. The body of the emperor, who was deposed by military officers in 1974 and was either murdered or simply allowed to die of neglect a year later, will be buried in a tomb in the Orthodox Trinity Cathedral in the capital, Addis Ababa. His body was exhumed from beneath a toilet in 1992, a year after the Marxist government of Mengistu Haile Mariam was overthrown. It has lain in a mausoleum in Addis Ababa since then.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: OPPOSITION CHARGES -- Men wearing military uniforms failed in an attempt to abduct the wife of the opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, but arrested eight of her bodyguards, Mr. Ouattara's spokesman said. The abduction attempt took place as Dominique Ouattara was leaving her office, the spokesman said. Mr. Ouattara, a former prime minister, says he intends to run against the military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, in presidential elections set for Oct. 22.</p>

Putin's four-day visit to India, the national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra, said. Mr. Putin reiterated Russia's support for India's membership in the United Nations Security Council.

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: TALIBAN DENIES CHARGES -- The ruling Taliban denied sending, sponsoring or training Islamic militants to wage war elsewhere in Central Asia. Russia has expressed fears that a recent string of Taliban victories in northern Afghanistan could embolden militants in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, particularly Tajikistan. But the Taliban foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, said Afghanistan did not have the resources or the desire to interfere in its neighbors' affairs.</p>

In other protests, dozens of demonstrators damaged a car outside the Parliament building in Jakarta, above. The government raised fuel prices by an average of 12 percent on Sunday.</p>
