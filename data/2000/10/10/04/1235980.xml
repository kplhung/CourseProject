      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Parole is denied. You murdered the victim, John Lennon, when you fired a .38 special caliber Charter Arm revolver filled with hollow-point bullets. You discharged all five chambers and hit Mr. Lennon as many as four times. Mr. Lennon was returning to his residence and was in the company of his wife when you committed this murder. This act was calculated and unprovoked. You had planned this crime for a protracted period of time, and it is apparent that you were obsessed in causing fatal harm to John Lennon. In addition to being an international celebrity, Mr. Lennon was a husband and a father of two young children.</p>
        <p>During your incarceration, you have maintained an exemplary disciplinary record which this panel has noted and considered.</p>

        <p>Parole is denied. You murdered the victim, John Lennon, when you fired a .38 special caliber Charter Arm revolver filled with hollow-point bullets. You discharged all five chambers and hit Mr. Lennon as many as four times. Mr. Lennon was returning to his residence and was in the company of his wife when you committed this murder. This act was calculated and unprovoked. You had planned this crime for a protracted period of time, and it is apparent that you were obsessed in causing fatal harm to John Lennon. In addition to being an international celebrity, Mr. Lennon was a husband and a father of two young children.</p>
        <p>During your incarceration, you have maintained an exemplary disciplinary record which this panel has noted and considered.</p>
        <p>This panel also recognizes that because of your continued special housing status, you have been unable to avail yourself of anti-violence and/or anti-aggression programming.</p>
        <p>Your most vicious and violent act was apparently fueled by your need to be acknowledged. During your parole hearing, this panel noted your continued interest in maintaining your notoriety.</p>
        <p>When all factors are reviewed, your discretionary release is determined to be inappropriate.</p>
        <p>Additionally, this panel strongly believes that your release to parole supervision at this time would deprecate the seriousness of the crime and serve to undermine respect for the law.</p>
