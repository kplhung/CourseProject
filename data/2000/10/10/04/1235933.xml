        <p>It is considered one of the world's most prominent botanical gardens, but its 80-year-old greenhouses -- where thousands of plants are meticulously cared for -- have a heating and cooling system that is considered uncontrollable. The gift shop operates out of a tent. And the 15 miles of roadways at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx are marked with potholes and cracks.</p>
        <p>A $300 million fund-raising campaign is about to get under way to address these and other shortcomings at the 250-acre complex, which was set up 109 years ago by a board that included Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt and J. Pierpont Morgan.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other top city officials visited the garden yesterday to announce a $22 million city donation to the seven-year effort, which calls for a new greenhouse complex, visitors' center, plant research laboratory, renovated classrooms and expanded parking.</p>
        <p>''This is a thing of beauty, a thing of culture, a thing of science,'' the mayor said. ''It also contributes an enormous amount to the bottom line of New York City.''</p>
        <p>The renovation plan being prepared is the second part of a rehabilitation effort started in 1993, with the first $208 million phase including repairs to the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, the nation's largest Victorian glasshouse, which holds the tropical and desert plant collections.</p>
        <p>The Botanical Garden is perhaps best known among professionals for its botanical research, its collection of seven million plant specimens and its plant science library. But the garden, which includes wetlands, ponds, a waterfall and a 40-acre tract of the original forest that once covered New York City, draws about 630,000 visitors a year, up about 25 percent from the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>The Botanical Garden has not yet officially begun the fund-raising campaign for the newest renovation project, but it already has commitments worth about $80 million, said Karl F. Lauby, a spokesman. Ultimately, over the next seven years, 22 different construction projects are planned.</p>
