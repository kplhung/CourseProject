        <p>On the opening day of the baseball playoffs, the Yankees looked very much like a team still playing in the closing weeks of the regular season.</p>
        <p>After giving Roger Clemens a 2-0 lead over the Athletics in Oakland, the Yankees were beaten, 5-3, in the opener of the three-of-five game series that resumes tonight.</p>
        <p>Counting the last seven games of the regular season, it was New York's eighth loss in a row.</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte will pitch Game 2 for the Yankees today against Oakland's Kevin Appier. The series shifts to Yankee Stadium on Friday night.</p>
        <p>Earlier, the St. Louis Cardinals held off the Atlanta Braves, 7-5, despite five wild pitches from their starter Rick Ankiel in the third inning, and the Seattle Mariners used consecutive home runs in the 10th inning by Edgar Martinez and John Olerud to beat the Chicago White Sox, 7-4.</p>
        <p>The Mets open their playoff series in San Francisco this afternoon.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, winners of the last two World Series in four-game sweeps, were losers in 15 of their last 18 regular-season games. They built a 2-0 lead in the second inning. Then their offense died, and the A's crept back, then crept ahead for good, helped by two wild pitches and superb relief pitching.</p>
