        <p>After a month of advertising on television with no rebuttal from the other side, Jon S.

        <p>After a month of advertising on television with no rebuttal from the other side, Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for the Senate from New Jersey, came under attack today for the first time on television, in a commercial paid for by a Republican with close ties to Representative Bob Franks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine, who appears to be widening his lead in the polls, continues to dominate the broadcast media, and released new advertisements of his own today, including another pointed attack on Mr. Franks's record in Congress.</p>
        <p>The new ad criticizing Mr. Corzine, which is to be broadcast on Philadelphia stations that reach the southern third of New Jersey and carried on cable networks across New Jersey, takes him to task for refusing to release his income tax returns, just as Mr. Franks has been doing for the last month. It cites many headlines in the state's newspapers and urges viewers to ''tell Jon Corzine to come clean on his finances.''</p>
        <p>Finn M. W. Caspersen, a leading Republican fund-raiser in New Jersey, said he had spent $250,000 of his own money to run the ad during the next two weeks, a paltry amount compared with the $1.3 million Mr. Corzine is spending each week. He denied having coordinated or discussed the commercial with the Franks campaign before placing it using a tax-exempt lobbying entity he controls called Citizens for a Better America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caspersen said he was concerned that despite many newspaper editorials calling on Mr. Corzine to divulge his tax returns -- Mr. Corzine says he is prevented from releasing them by a confidentiality agreement with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, his former employer -- most people seemed unaware of the issue. ''Unfortunately, not enough people really read the papers,'' he said. ''I just wanted to elevate it to a higher level of debate.''</p>
        <p>But advocates for campaign finance reform called the move a blatant end run around the contribution limits for Senate races. ''The notion that it's not being done in coordination, or to assist a candidate, of course is laughable,'' said Charles Lewis, president of the Center for Public Integrity. ''The fact that the candidate talks about something, and then someone is suddenly running ads that echo the candidate's statements, means of course it's related, whether or not they admit it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Caspersen said he had given the maximum allowable to Mr. Franks's campaign this year, $1,000 in the primary and $1,000 for the general election. He is also a member of the steering committee of the Republican Leadership Council. Mr. Franks is a member of the group's advisory committee.</p>
        <p>The leadership council, which works on behalf of moderate Republican candidates, began running a radio ad critical of Mr. Corzine on Sept. 25, similarly echoing Mr. Franks's campaign arguments. Mr. Caspersen said he had nothing to do with that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caspersen, the former chairman of the Beneficial Corporation, has at least one thing in common with Mr. Corzine: both are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. When Beneficial was sold to Household International in 1998, he and his family's trusts controlled stock worth $860 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's campaign manager, Charlie Smith, said he was unaware of Mr. Caspersen's initiative until today. ''This is a campaign against someone who's spending unheard of sums of money in an effort to buy a Senate seat, and any help that's offered by people who find that distasteful is appreciated here.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Franks is trailing Mr. Corzine by a wide margin in most recent polls. A survey by The Record of Hackensack published on Monday placed Mr. Corzine's lead at 14 percentage points among likely voters, and Quinnipiac University of Hamden, Conn., is expected to release a survey on Wednesday giving Mr. Corzine another double-digit lead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, began broadcasting two new commercials in both the New York and Philadelphia television markets today. One, titled ''Endorsed,'' promotes Mr. Corzine's endorsement by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Handgun Control, the Sierra Club, the New Jersey Environmental Federation and the National Organization of Women.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Corzine, Tom Shea, said the ad refuted Mr. Franks's contention that only he could truly represent New Jerseyans. ''If all the groups that represent all the things we know are most important in New Jersey -- education, guns, the environment, choice -- are standing with Jon Corzine, I think it's pretty clear which of these two candidates truly represents New Jersey's values,'' Mr. Shea said.</p>
        <p>The other ad, called ''Dismantle,'' laces into Mr. Franks for voting to cut future growth in Medicare, abolish the Department of Education, cut financing for the Environmental Protection Agency, and shut down the federal government in the 1995 showdown between Congress and President Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Bob Franks,'' the announcer intones, ''more interested in dismantling the government than he is in making the government work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine is also heavily outspending Mr. Franks's allies on the radio, again with two ads, both a minute long. One is a commercial that touches on his farmboy-to-financier life story and his desire to ''extend America's promise to everyone.'' The other says ''Bob Franks is dangerous to New Jersey's health,'' over the sound of a beeping heart monitor suddenly going flat, as if a patient has just died.</p>
