        <p>Neuberger Berman Inc. shares jumped 5 percent to a record high on speculation that the company, a money manager that caters to wealthy people, could be bought in what would be the latest in a series of acquisitions of fund companies.</p>
        <p>Shares of Neuberger, which went public last October at $32, climbed $3.63, to $68.38. Since Sept. 27, the shares have surged 13.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Lane, chief executive of Neuberger, which has a $3.3 billion market value, declined to comment. ''If we had something to report, we'd report it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Neuberger had $54.4 billion under management as of June 30. The firm's high-net-worth business would be especially attractive to an acquirer, as firms that specialize in rich clients are scarce, said William Katz, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, which rates the company a long-term buy.</p>
