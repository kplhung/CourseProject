        <p>One recent afternoon, Thomas P. Morahan, a first-term Republican state senator, ventured confidently here into a part of his district that was, just over a year ago, an enemy stronghold.</p>
        <p>Back then, this heavily Democratic village's most prominent Democratic leaders, from the mayor on down, had vowed to defeat Mr. Morahan and his powerful Republican patrons in Albany. But on this cool, crisp afternoon, Mr. Morahan was welcomed like a long-lost friend, as he campaigned for another term along this village's streets -- with many of the same Democrats who once opposed him walking at his side.</p>
        <p>''Come on over and meet Senator Morahan,'' Allan Thompson, the village's mayor, called out to a group of men wandering down Main Street. ''He's been very good to us. I want to make sure we support him on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morahan's newfound popularity underscores the lengths to which he and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature have gone to curry favor among moderate voters, particularly Democrats and independents, in a year when they face some of the toughest re-election challenges in recent memory. (Mr. Morahan is running against Kenneth P. Zebrowski, a Rockland County legislator.)</p>
        <p>In recent months, Republican leaders in Albany have forsaken bedrock conservative principles to assemble a record that seeks to deprive Democrats of issues to use against incumbents in fiercely competitive districts like Mr. Morahan's: the state's first hate-crimes law, restrictions on gun owners, criminal penalties for blocking access to abortion clinics and expanded government health insurance for the poor.</p>
        <p>That is on top of tens of millions of dollars in pork-barrel projects that Republican leaders have been aggressively directing to districts like the 38th here in Rockland and Orange Counties. In Mr. Morahan's case alone, at least $3 million has been set aside to help pay for the senator's pet projects.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Morahan has benefited politically, allowing him to construct a reputation as a man who gets things done for people, regardless of their politics. It is something that is abundantly evident on the campaign trail, where he delivers his message in a direct manner that is free of the partisanship that so often seeps into the talk of politicians. Instead, he projects the image of a down-to-earth kind of guy bent on solving problems with common sense, not ideological remedies.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, a recent campaign trip he made to nearby Haverstraw, where he suddenly found himself surrounded by a throng of homeowners who peppered him with all sorts of complaints about a road repair project that was disrupting their quiet, leafy development of modest colonial-style homes. ''Hold on a minute,'' Mr. Morahan interrupted at one point, trying to raise his voice above the din of protests. ''Let's deal with one problem at a time.'' Then, trying to get to the heart of the problem, he asked: ''Are we talking money here?''</p>
        <p>The stakes are high this year. Republicans are worried about their ability to defend the majority they hold in the State Senate. Democrats far outnumber Republicans in the state, and the only way that Republicans have held a 36-to-25 advantage is by controlling a handful of districts, like Mr. Morahan's, where Democrats have an edge in voter enrollment. This year, defending those seats may be more difficult than in past years because Republicans face the prospect of a strong Democratic turnout propelled by the popularity the Democrats' national ticket has in New York.</p>
        <p>Democratic leaders in Albany plan to challenge 13 Republican senators, though they admit that they do not expect to win that many races. Instead, they hope to knock off enough incumbents in swing districts to reclaim a majority. But even if they fail at that, they hope to pick up enough seats to make it harder for Republicans to control legislation as tightly as they can now.</p>
        <p>Senator Eric T. Schneiderman of Manhattan, who heads the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, said the political shift among Republicans would do them little good. ''I think it's too little too late,'' he said. ''Voters are not going to believe that Republicans have suddenly become liberals based on a handful of votes.''</p>
        <p>All this puts Mr. Morahan on the front lines of the struggle for the State Senate: a district that both major parties believe they can win. In voter registration, Democrats hold an advantage of 42 percent to 28 percent over Republicans in the 38th District, about 25 miles northwest of New York City. But the two parties are equally competitive. Rockland's Legislature has changed party control twice in four years, the county executive is a Republican and the county's two assemblymen are Democrats. President Clinton and the Republican governor, George E. Pataki, have won twice in the district.</p>
        <p>The Orthodox Jewish community played a leading role in electing Mr. Morahan, and have played similar roles in other local and statewide races. In recent months, the Republican majority leader of the Senate has met with Orthodox Jewish leaders to discuss legislation they are seeking -- and, in the process, win support for the Republican Senate candidate. But Democrats complain that that is akin to trying to buy the election.</p>
        <p>The race also underscores the crucial role that money plays in protecting the majority party. Like many of his Republican colleagues, Mr. Morahan stands to benefit from the substantial war chest amassed by the Senate Republican Campaign Committee: over $3 million, even after recent campaign spending, with much of the money coming from the health-care, insurance and banking industries, as well as labor unions and other Democratic allies.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Morahan's Democratic challenger, Mr. Zebrowski, faces the daunting job of raising money not only as a challenger but also as a member of the Senate's minority party. Mr. Zebrowski says he has raised about $40,000. He says he expects to receive help from Senate Democratic leaders in Albany, but they report having less than $500,000 left in the Senate Democratic campaign treasury after recent campaign expenses.</p>
        <p>In the end, though, the race will depend largely on the personalities of both men and the way they are perceived among the largely moderate voters of the 38th District. Mr. Morahan, 68, is a former majority leader of the County Legislature who has a brusque, plain-spoken manner that puts off some people. He is blunt about one of his main accomplishments since winning his seat 17 months ago in a special election:  delivering more pork-barrel spending than any Democrat could hope to in a house controlled by Republicans. The amount of money he has sprinkled throughout his district is impressive indeed: $2 million for Clarkstown, $200,000 for Orangetown, $550,000 for Haverstraw, $200,000 for Spring Valley and on and on.</p>
        <p>One of the accomplishments he most often talks about on the campaign trail is his sponsorship of a new state program that covers the cost of prescription drugs for elderly New Yorkers. On a recent trip to Haverstraw, one of his aides passed out brochures that not only provided information about the program but also featured a photo of Mr. Morahan with his name written in bold red letters along the top, leaving no doubt about who deserved the credit.</p>
        <p>(The story behind the program's creation is itself a source of election-year sniping between the two parties. A few months ago, the Senate's leaders handed Mr. Morahan primary sponsorship of the bill that called for creating the program, keenly aware of its popularity. Senate Democrats immediately cried foul, pointing out that they had come up with the idea first -- which they had -- and that the Republicans had adopted it without so much as acknowledging their names on the bill, which became  law.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Zebrowski is 14 years younger than Mr. Morahan and has a sharp and rapid-fire manner of speaking. He is the majority leader of the County Legislature and lost to Mr. Morahan in last year's special election for the Senate seat that became vacant with the resignation of the incumbent, Joseph R. Holland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zebrowski and his Democratic allies scoff at the suggestion that Mr. Morahan is politically moderate, noting that he has taken stands publicly against abortion rights. ''Mr. Morahan is a classic conservative Republican,'' Mr. Zebrowski said, adding, ''He is attempting to shift his positions.''</p>
        <p>But if a day on the campaign trail is any measure, voters are not all that swayed by Mr. Zebrowski's case. On Mr. Morahan's recent visit to Spring Valley, he was stopped by one of the village's trustees, Margareth Jourdan, a Democrat who offered him thanks for the work he had done for the district.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jourdan said she had been converted, particularly after he had come up with $20,000 for a local youth program. ''You are one of the few officials here who cares about this community,'' she told him. ''You have put yourself out for all of us, regardless of who we are.''</p>
