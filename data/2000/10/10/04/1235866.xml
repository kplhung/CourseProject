        <p>NOT long ago, miso was found almost exclusively in Japanese markets and health food stores. It was used in not much more than soup.</p>
        <p>Now, you can buy it in many supermarkets, and you should definitely try it in many more dishes.</p>
        <p>Miso is a paste produced from fermented soybeans; it has an intense flavor -- sweeter, saltier and more complex than soy sauce. But it is also a superb thickener: whisk it into a small amount of liquid and it creates a rich, creamy consistency.</p>
        <p>When you add it with a little wine to the juices in a saute pan after searing a pork chop, it becomes a great sauce with almost no work.</p>
        <p>You brown the pork on both sides, reduce the red wine and stir in the miso until the sauce is smooth.</p>
        <p>If you want to add a garnish, you can use any herb, but I like shiso, a leaf that is sometimes called Japanese basil and has a flavor something like a cross between basil and mint.</p>
        <p>The only caution in cooking with miso is that it must be handled gently; high heat practically destroys its flavor.</p>
        <p>For the pork, I prefer a bone-in chop, from the rib end of the loin if possible. It's a little bit fattier than other chops, which is a benefit rather than a detriment, since modern pork is so lean.</p>
        <p>Boneless steaks from the loin or tenderloin can be substituted, as can many cuts of beef, like rib-eye, strip or skirt steaks. Just remember to reduce the cooking time slightly.</p>
        <p>A red wine with some body works well here, one from the south of France or a California zinfandel or cabernet sauvignon. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it should be good enough to drink.</p>
        <p>Red miso, which is actually brown, is best for this dish, not least because it is the easiest to find. It also adds terrific color to the sauce.</p>
        <p>PORK CUTLET WITH MISO SAUCE  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>4 1-inch-thick bone-in pork chops, each about 6 ounces  Salt and freshly cracked black pepper  1 cup sturdy red wine, like Cotes du Rhone or cabernet sauvignon  2 tablespoons red miso</p>
        <p>1/4 cup roughly chopped shiso, basil or parsley, optional.</p>
        <p>1. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat 2 to 3 minutes, then add the chops. Sprinkle them with a little salt and a lot of pepper. Brown them on one side 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and brown the other side until chop is firm and nearly cooked through, 3 or 4 minutes. Remove to a warm plate, and turn the heat to medium.</p>
        <p>2. Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to loosen any bits of meat that have stuck to the pan, until the wine reduces by about half. Turn heat to low, and add miso; stir briskly until smooth (a wire whisk will help).</p>
        <p>3. Taste the sauce, and if necessary, add more pepper and salt. Spoon sauce over the chops, garnish with herbs if you like, and serve.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
