        <p>Each man had a plan tonight in the first debate of the 2000 presidential campaign -- a campaign as close, when the two stepped to the podium in Boston, as the near-legendary 1960 race.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas set out to show that he is a plausible, knowledgeable candidate for the presidency, not the political novice, as deep as a birdbath, that his detractors describe. Vice President Al Gore set out to demonstrate that he is neither an attack dog nor a robot, as some who dislike him suggest.  And both worked hard to convince the crucial undecided voters that their programs on education, on taxes and on medical care merit support.</p>
        <p>When it was over, both the Republican and the Democrat had some reason for satisfaction. Amid a welter of conflicting claims and numbers, Mr. Bush had managed to paint Mr. Gore as a Washington insider who would ''increase the size of government substantially,'' and Mr. Gore had tarred the Texan as an advocate of using the federal budget surplus to ''enrich the few, the wealthiest 1 percent.''</p>
        <p>The contenders were talking to the whole country, minus those who couldn't watch or didn't care enough to watch, and those who preferred to watch the baseball playoffs. It was by far the biggest audience either had ever faced, and the stakes were much the highest that either had ever played for.</p>
        <p>But their real target was that small segment of voters who have made no commitment, in a half-dozen or so states, including Missouri, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- voters in cities like Allentown, Pa., which has voted with the winner for 30 years, and in suburbs like Wayne, Pa., where the Democrats have been registering gains in the last two months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush chose a family from Allentown to illustrate how his tax plan and Mr. Gore's would work out.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think the debate changed anything fundamental,'' said Drew Lewis, a prominent Pennsylvania Republican who served as transportation secretary in the Reagan administration. ''If I had to pick a winner, I'd flip a coin. I thought Gore made a very strong point on that 1 percent, but at the same time I was pleasantly surprised by how well Bush handled his material. He wasn't overwhelmed at all.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, also a Republican, said rin an interview that he was struck by the contrast in debating styles. Although Mr. Gore spoke more extensively than Mr. Bush, Mr. Ridge said, ''he sounded as if he was lecturing the country, tutoring it, and Bush was conducting a personal conversation with the voters.''</p>
        <p>Neil Oxman of Philadelphia, a leading Democratic political consultant, gave the nod to Mr. Gore on points, saying there had been no knockouts. Although he thought the vice president's command of the issues had been superior, he said Mr. Bush had done well enough. After watching the debate, Mr. Oxman added, ''I don't think that people would think, 'Geez, that guy knows absolutely nothing.' ''</p>
        <p>A Democratic veteran of many campaigns, former Mayor Pete Flaherty of Pittsburgh, said both candidates had spent too much time niggling over details. He said Mr. Bush had looked a bit out of his depth on the Balkans, but credited the governor with an effective rejoinder to the charge that he favors the rich in noting that Mr. Gore's tax plan would save the middle-class Strunks of Allentown $145 and his own would save them $1,800.</p>
        <p>Neither man committed an obvious gaffe; Mr. Bush avoided stumbling over his own syntax or comically mispronouncing words as he had in the past. Clearly less fluent than the vice president, he hesitated at times and gave incomplete replies at others, but on occasion he seemed more spontaneous and less programmed than Mr. Gore. Mr. Bush attacked more directly, accusing his rival of making ''totally false'' statements about his health care proposals, using ''fuzzy math'' and ''phony numbers,'' and ''running on Medi scare.''</p>
        <p>Grappling frontally with the opponent's program, firing comments back and forth, the two staged something approaching a traditional debate. In the past, candidates have tended to make speeches while standing beside each other, rather than actually debating.</p>
        <p>More money has been spent on the presidential race so far in Pennsylvania than in any other state -- in excess of $21 million, one study indicates. The contest here is close, according to the polls, but not so close as in some other states. While they insist that Pennsylvania's 23 electoral votes are still in play, important Bush backers here concede that winning them will probably be harder for the governor than winning Ohio, Michigan or Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Still, in Pennsylvania as elsewhere, there is a discrepancy between polls. A survey taken last Tuesday through Thursday for The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette showed Mr. Gore up by only four percentage points, 45 to 41, while a new Keystone Poll, taken Thursday through Sunday for a group of media clients in the state, showed him ahead by 12 points, 49 to 37. The director of the Keystone Poll, Bernard Yost of Millersville University, said it showed that voters here ''really do question Bush's intellect.''</p>
        <p>Whether that is true and whether it remains true after the debate still remain to be seen, of course.</p>
        <p>Whether the debate will really move the undecided voters, and so prove decisive, is also unclear, although most politicians, and many political scientists, believe it will.</p>
        <p>There are two kinds of undecided voters: those who are just starting to pay attention and those who are genuinely torn. In many past presidential elections, a considerable number of undecided voters decided not to vote, despite all the efforts to sway them. Will that be so this year? Are many of the undecideds really nonvoters-to-be? Are others people who will make up their minds only as they enter the booth, regardless of debate points scored?</p>
        <p>This much, at least, is evident: On Wednesday, both candidates will resume their courtship of the swing states. Mr. Bush is to appear in West Chester, Pa., which lies in pivotal Chester County, just west of Philadelphia, and in Columbus, Ohio. On Thursday he will be in Michigan. Mr. Gore will campaign in Ohio on Wednesday and in Michigan on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was especially careful tonight when dealing with abortion, a highly divisive issue in Pennsylvania. He made clear his opposition to abortion, but he declined to say either that he would seek as president to reverse the Food and Drug Administration's approval of RU-486, the abortion pill, or that he would nominate opponents of Roe v. Wade to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Much of tonight's long, complicated, often confusing discussion about prescription drugs also seemed to have a special relevance to Pennsylvania, which has one of the highest proportions of elderly people in the nation. But the NBC affiliates in the state's two biggest markets, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, were among those that opted for baseball and not politics.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CONTEXT  Correction:  October 5, 2000, Thursday  A news analysis article yesterday about the performances of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in their first debate referred imprecisely in some copies to a criticism of the candidates. The observation that they took ''too much time niggling over details'' was a paraphrase of comments by former Mayor Pete Flaherty of Pittsburgh, not a quotation.</p>
        <p>In some copies the article misstated the location of West Chester, Pa., where Mr. Bush campaigned yesterday. It is in Chester County, not Montgomery.</p>
