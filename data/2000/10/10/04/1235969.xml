        <p>Pencils ready?</p>
        <p>Exercise A: A subway train is scheduled to arrive in a station every three minutes. Instead, it takes one train six minutes to show up. Is that train on time?</p>
        <p>According to New York City Transit, the answer is yes. And though it might sound like a page from a junior-high math primer, the question is more than academic. It goes to the heart of an issue that matters greatly to millions of New Yorkers: What does ''on time'' really mean for subways and buses anyway? And who gets to decide?</p>
        <p>Delays in the airline industry are monitored by independent government agencies. Those statistics, as most weary airline passengers know too well, are widely reported, and often generate pressure that forces changes in air travel.</p>
        <p>New York City Transit, on the other hand, monitors itself. The agency thus has the power to choose its own definition of timeliness for its subways and buses.</p>
        <p>So recently, transit planners announced that they intended to use that power and scrap the ''on time'' definition they have used for five years, which gave high scores to trains and buses that were evenly spaced. The new definition they want to use would allow trains and buses to arrive early or three minutes late and still be counted as on time.</p>
        <p>The agency says the new system will be more accurate and useful for planners. But it also  happens to give the agency much higher ratings, and this has set off alarms for transit watchdogs.</p>
        <p>Both the authority and its critics face the same problem: in one of the largest and most complicated transit systems in the world, how do you measure service in a way that honestly reflects what riders actually experience every day?</p>
        <p>For commuter railroads, whose trains run less frequently, it is done the old-fashioned way, with schedules. Riders know that the 7:18 p.m. to Poughkeepsie is supposed to leave Grand Central at that time and get into Poughkeepsie at 8:59 because that is what the timetables say.</p>
        <p>The city's subways also have published schedules, but hardly any riders know they exist.</p>
        <p>That is because most subway riders do not want to know whether the 8:01 No. 2 is usually on time at 42nd Street. What they really want to know is two things: How often is the No. 2 supposed to arrive in the morning? Is it reliable?</p>
        <p>The same is true for city buses, though published schedules are consulted more often by bus riders.</p>
        <p>But for many years, while even critics were conceding that subway and bus service was getting much better, New York City Transit provided riders with almost no information on its reliability.</p>
        <p>Instead, the agency's main way for measuring how well it was doing was by recording whether a train left one end of the line on time and arrived at the other end on time. Figuring out what happened in between the two terminals, the place where nearly all of the passengers were waiting, was not a priority.</p>
        <p>Then in 1994, something happened to change that. The inspector general for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose office serves as an independent monitor, found that the agency's terminal-to-terminal figures were largely made up. (The  train dispatchers themselves kept the figures.) In fact, auditors found that only one-fifth of the trains that were actually late were being counted as late.</p>
        <p>As a result of the audit, the transit agency decided to come up with a new way of measuring service and to use semi-independent train monitors who would not feel pressure to inflate the numbers.</p>
        <p>This yardstick, the one now in use, says that service does not have to be exactly on time, which would be impossible in such a crowded system. But it has to be close. So the system, which is used to measure service from the morning to the evening rush, takes into account what the spaces between trains and buses should be. Then it measures their reliability as a proportion of this.</p>
        <p>In other words, if a train or bus on a busy line is supposed to arrive every three minutes, then it is held to a stricter standard than a train or bus on a less busy line that is supposed to arrive every seven minutes.</p>
        <p>So, for example, a three-minute train is ''on time'' if it shows up within four and a half minutes. A seven-minute train gets a proportionately larger cushion: it is ''on time'' if it shows up within 10 1/2 minutes.</p>
        <p>In addition, if trains and buses arrive much too early, they are counted as not on time. The reasoning is that if they are early, creating a condition called bunching, the system ends up with some overcrowded buses and trains and others carrying almost nobody.</p>
        <p>For several years, transit officials have complained that not only is this system hard to apply, even harder to understand and unfair to the transit agency, but it also provides incentives for planners to do some unfriendly things to passengers in the name of improving statistics.</p>
        <p>For example, dispatchers can hold early trains in stations to even out the spacing between trains. This makes the reliability statistics improve. But the strategy can also create rush-hour nightmares for riders, who may have already waited 20 minutes for a stalled train to be moved out of the way and then have to wait another five minutes for a working train to show up.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I don't even look at these statistics,'' said Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, in a recent interview at the agency's headquarters in Brooklyn. ''We don't run this system to statistics. We run it for the passengers.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Reuter wants to do is simplify the measurements by applying a universal three-minute late standard to all buses and trains. This means that a three-minute train would be counted on time if it showed up in six minutes. The system would also make all early trains and buses, no matter how early, be counted as on time.</p>
        <p>While the pros and cons of the new system are the subject of a vigorous debate, one thing is not in dispute: It gives the transit agency much better grades, especially during rush hours, when spaces between trains should be much smaller and the three-minute standard is much more forgiving.</p>
        <p>The reliability of the No. 4 train would rise from 72 percent to 89 percent, transit officials say. The A train would go from 70 percent on time to 84 percent on time. The grade of the M86 bus in Manhattan would go from 52 percent to 82 percent on time, and those are not even the  starkest examples.</p>
        <p>Critics of the new system concede that the old one may not be completely fair to the transit agency because there are many factors beyond its control: passengers who hold doors or who become sick, trucks blocking bus lanes. Critics say that changing the measure is bad public policy.</p>
        <p>''It's going to make people a lot angrier, I think, because the dichotomy between what they're experiencing and what the numbers are saying is going to get a lot bigger,'' said Michael T. Doyle, associate director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A.</p>
        <p>Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer with the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group, added that the issue of measuring train and bus service, and whether the measure is an accurate reflection of what riders experience, is more important than most riders realize.</p>
        <p>''It's not just five people within the transit authority who collect and read these numbers,'' he said. ''The numbers are published and they generate stories and that attention has often forced the T.A. to make its service better.''</p>
        <p>This sentiment echoes the inspector general in 1994, who warned that unreliable monitoring of trains was not only dishonest but might also be causing the transit agency ''to lose touch with the real level of service it is providing, creating an unwarranted sense of confidence.''</p>
        <p>The transit agency says it understands that there will be disagreements about how to decide how well  the system operates. But it bridles at the suggestion that its proposed change is in any way dishonest.</p>
        <p>''We're really not in any way trying to cook the books or fool anyone,'' Mr. Reuter said. ''We put out more numbers on more things than any agency I know, and if we wanted to make ourselves look better, we could just stop making these kinds of measures at all.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I want a management tool that I can actually use.''</p>
        <p>So which side is right? Which measure is fairer and more accurate for both the riding public and the agency?</p>
        <p>Harry Hatry, an analyst at the Urban Institute, which looks at better ways to measure the performance of public agencies, said that these kinds of debates would play out much more often as computers and the Internet made the collection and distribution of all kinds of new performance data easier to a taxpaying -- in this case, fare-paying -- public.</p>
        <p>There are no easy answers, he said. But maybe one way to solve such debates is by extending the yardstick in both directions, devising  ways to measure not only how an agency performs but also how it is affected by things it cannot control.</p>
        <p>''Right now the focus is very heavily on what the responsibility of government is to the public and measuring that,'' Mr. Hatry said. ''But at some point the focus might also include what the public's responsibility is for the services being provided.''</p>
        <p>In other words, Example B: If a subway train is supposed to arrive every three minutes, but it shows up in six minutes because somebody got into a yelling match with the conductor and then held the doors open, is that train on time?</p>
