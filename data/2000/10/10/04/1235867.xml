        <p>BRUNELLO di Montalcino is a brooding Tuscan monster of a wine, requiring years of aging to release an inner core of dark, concentrated fruit from its wrapping of steely tannins.</p>
        <p>By contrast, rosso di Montalcino is brunello's cheery little brother -- fruity, inviting and much less expensive, intended to be enjoyed in its youth. At least, so goes the theory.</p>
        <p>In a tasting of a dozen rossos, I found half to be fully as impenetrable as young brunellos, with fruit wrapped in a knot of tannins and acidity without the promise of a payoff to come.</p>
        <p>The ones I liked best were still surprisingly thick and chewy but also had a fruity structure potent enough to complement the tannins.</p>
        <p>These are not light and fruity wines that you would serve at cocktail parties or as aperitifs. They bloom fully only in the company of sausages, tomato-based sauces and other foods that are fatty or acidic enough to match power with power.</p>
        <p>Both brunello and rosso are made from the brunello grape, a particular strain of sangiovese, which is the base grape of Chianti. To qualify as brunello, the wine must be aged in barrels for at least two years and cannot be released before it is four years old.</p>
        <p>The rossos, on the other hand, can be released after only one year, which theoretically allows producers to use only their best grapes for the more expensive wine, and the rest for rossos, just as Bordeaux winemakers often produce second labels with lesser grapes.</p>
        <p>Even so, some producers are tempted to gussy up these wines into something fancy.</p>
        <p>I've often enjoyed the rossos from Caparzo. This time around I found La Caduta, Caparzo's single-vineyard rosso, which was oakier and more tannic than Caparzo's ordinary rosso. And it was twice the price.</p>
        <p>MASTROJANNI  1998 $24  Layers of fruit under smoky tannins.</p>
        <p>. . .  COLLOSORBO  1998 $22  Deep and dense; fruit stands up to the strong tannins.</p>
        <p>. . .  COL  D'ORCIA  1998 $14  Pleasant berry flavors behind firm, dusty tannins.</p>
        <p>. . .  CAPARZO , LA  CADUTA  1996 $35  Sweet oakiness mingled with fruit over high tannins.</p>
        <p>. . .  CANTINA DI  MONTALCINO  1997 $21  Pleasing berry aromas, sweet and smoky in the mouth, tannic finish.</p>
        <p>. . .  CIACCI  PICCOLOMINI  D'ARAGONA , VIGNA DELLA  FONTE  1998 $20  Sweet and soft fruits balance harsh tannins.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various wine shops in the New York region.</p>
