        <p>Dr. Khaled Qurie, the director of East Jerusalem's busiest hospital, opened the Kalfany Bonbons tin on his desk today and offered one of the items inside to a visitor.</p>
        <p>The small black ball, about the size of a Milk Dud, was not a sweet, but a rubber-coated steel pellet, one of several varieties of theoretically non-lethal bullets Dr. Qurie has collected from his patients in the last few days.</p>
        <p>In clear storage jars atop Dr. Qurie's filing cabinet, he keeps 10 more of the rubber bullets, used by the Israelis for riot-control as a safer alternative to live ammunition. Some are spherical, some cylindrical, some sheathed in plastic, some covered in rubber. Each has a neatly lettered label specifying from whom, when, and from what part of the body it had been extracted.</p>
        <p>''The surprise was the high number of upper body injuries -- abdomen, chest, neck and head,'' he said, reviewing from memory the cases of the 35 Palestinians who had been admitted to Makassed Hospital on Friday.</p>
        <p>Most had serious wounds from the chaotic confrontation between Israeli police and Muslim worshippers outside Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock. Six of the patients died, three of them hit by conventional bullets and three by the non-exploding rubber-coated projectiles.</p>
        <p>An Israeli Army spokesman, Maj. Yarden Vatikai, said such cases are unfortunate but unavoidable aberrations in armed clashes ''with hundreds and sometimes thousands of people,'' many of whom are lobbing stones and gasoline bombs at the troops. Israeli troops only fire live ammunition in response to incoming fire or ''when lives are threatened,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Qurie's collection is a prime exhibit in the case being made here by Palestinians and some Israelis here, as well as by diplomats abroad, that Israeli forces have employed deadly force too readily in confrontations with Palestinian rioters in the last six days. Israeli soldiers are taught to fire the coated projectiles from specially adapted M-16's from at least 100 feet away and only at the feet and legs, army officers say.</p>
        <p>But there are many documented instances of close-range shootings at eye level: since Friday doctors at St. John's Eye Hospital in Jerusalem have treated 18 Palestinians who were shot in the eye with rubber projectiles, said Michael Cook, the chief executive there; most of the damaged eyes were left sightless, he said.</p>
        <p>Israel's critics, backed by the European Union, are calling for an international inquest into the casualties. At least 42 Palestinians have been killed in the clashes, including 13 children. And for the first time since peace talks led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority six years ago, Israelis have fired on civilians from helicopter gunships  used armor-piercing missiles.</p>
        <p>To the dismay of Israeli officials, the United States has joined in the criticism. At the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York today, the United States provisionally endorsed a draft statement condemning Israel for ''the acts of provocation, the violence, and the excessive use of deadly force against Palestinian civilians in the past few days.''</p>
        <p>Many of the other 14 Security Council members, over unyielding  American objections, pressed unsuccessfully for stronger language accusing Israel of violating the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which sets rules for the treatment of civilians by occupying military powers.</p>
        <p>The government of Israel contends it is not an occupying military power in East Jerusalem or the Palestinian territories under the terms of the convention.</p>
        <p>Israeli Army officers acknowledged today that their troops may have been responsible for killing 12-year-old Muhammed al-Durrah in Gaza on Saturday. His death has been universally acknowledged as both tragic and politically costly for the Israelis.</p>
        <p>But some international commentators found the killing of a Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver who was trying to come to the boy's aid equally disturbing. In an unusual written protest, the International Committee of the Red Cross publicly ''deplored'' the driver's death and cited the obligations of military forces under the Fourth Geneva Convention to ''respect and protect civilians and to apply the principle of proportionality whenever the use of force is required.''</p>
        <p>At least 18 Red Crescent ambulances have been hit by gunfire, said Uriel Masad, the International Red Cross spokesman in Israel. The Red Cross also condemned the 11 reported attacks in Palestinian areas on Israeli Magen David Adom ambulances.</p>
        <p>''We don't think that the ambulances are being targeted,'' Mr. Masad said. ''The problem is probably that some ambulances, especially the Palestinian ambulances, head right into the middle of the battlefield.</p>
        <p>''But if they are suddenly in the midst of the crossfire, their work must still be respected. Halt the shooting, and let them tend to the wounded. Then resume your killing, if you must.''</p>
