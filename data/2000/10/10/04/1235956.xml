        <p>The Serbian government issued a harsh warning to the democratic opposition today, promising ''special measures'' and prosecutions against those organizing a spreading general strike in Serbia intended to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>The statement, read on state television, heralded a counterattack on political leaders who are organizing the strikes to support Mr. Milosevic's challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, and on the independent media reporting on the effort.</p>
        <p>Early today, the police arrested the head of the public transport trade union, Dragoljub Stosic, and ordered protesters to clear away their obstacles blocking the bus garage.</p>
        <p>The government also announced that it was investigating allegations of sabotage against 11 organizers of a coal miners' strike at Kolubara and would seek their arrest. State television said two opposition politicians who have helped the strikers, Nebojsa Covic and Boris Tadic, would also face charges.</p>
        <p>The opposition is trying to force Mr. Milosevic to concede an outright, first-round electoral victory to Mr. Kostunica, who says that only widespread government vote fraud denied him the presidency outright in elections on Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic is organizing a second-round runoff for Sunday that Mr. Kostunica vows to boycott, saying that his victory was stolen from him and that a runoff is unnecessary.</p>
        <p>In its statement today, the government said, ''The violent behavior of individuals and groups that threatens citizens' lives, disrupts normal functioning of traffic, prevents normal work of industry, schools, institutions and health facilities will be proscribed by law.''</p>
        <p>''Special measures will be taken against the organizers of these criminal activities,'' the government said, adding, ''These measures also apply to media that are financed from abroad and are breeding lies, untruths and inciting bloodshed.''</p>
        <p>The statement followed a televised address by Mr. Milosevic on Monday in which he labeled opposition leaders -- especially Zoran Djindjic, who is running the strike campaign -- as puppets of NATO and the West. While Mr. Milosevic did not name Mr. Djindjic, the reference was clear.</p>
        <p>The Milosevic government is trying to tough out increasingly detailed allegations of vote fraud.</p>
        <p>An opposition economist, Mladjan Dinkic, said today that he had new evidence of vote fraud given to him by officials in the Federal Statistics Bureau, and that its head, Milovan Zivkovic, told him privately the ''truth'' was on the side of the opposition. Mr. Dinkic and his colleague, Miroljub Labus, said they had been given a copy of software used by the Federal Election Commission to distribute falsified and voided votes to Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>In a interview, Mr. Labus said the software had ''flags'' that gave operators options to include prefabricated voting totals into otherwise accurate results. He said the Federal Election Commission appeared to have counted Mr. Kostunica's votes accurately, but added ''not more than 170,000 votes'' to Mr. Milosevic's totals, almost entirely from the constituencies of Montenegro, Vranje and Prokuplje, the latter two extended to cover the territory of Kosovo and full of ''phantom polling stations.''</p>
        <p>Even with confusion about some 50,000 military votes, Mr. Labus said: ''I'm absolutely positive Mr. Kostunica was elected in the first round. It's a game of small numbers to push Mr. Kostunica under 50 percent. But even without the military votes, you find that he has a majority of over 51 percent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinkic said he also was thrown a computer diskette from a window of the statistical bureau that contains election results from individual polling stations. But he refused to reveal the contents today, saying that it was up the Electoral Commission to come clean.</p>
        <p>An opposition appeal to the Constitutional Court for a recount of the first-round votes will be heard on Wednesday morning.</p>
        <p>In the maneuvering, there is increasing concern, especially from Western governments, that the opposition will not push Mr. Milosevic from power quickly, and that participation in the second round on Sunday, despite clear evidence of vote fraud in the first, could be the best way to defeat Mr. Milosevic if some international guarantees could be negotiated.</p>
        <p>Western officials are pressing Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, who has influence over Mr. Milosevic, to work to resolve the dispute or somehow postpone the second round.</p>
        <p>To that end, officials said, Mr. Kostunica is expected to accept an invitation by Mr. Putin to travel to Moscow to discuss the election dispute, possibly on Thursday, so long as he can see Mr. Putin personally. Mr. Putin, who was in India on an official visit today, has also invited Mr. Milosevic, who has not ruled out attending, according to his brother, Borislav Milosevic, the Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow.</p>
        <p>Jiri Dienstbier, the United Nations special investigator for human rights for the former Yugoslavia, said today in Belgrade that there had been clear irregularities in the election and urged a recount. ''The results must have been manipulated,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The strike spread today, with some 50,000 students in Belgrade toying with police by deciding to march from the city center toward Mr. Milosevic's home in the suburb of Dedinje. The police, who are always deployed to deter a march to Dedinje, turned the students back after amicable negotiations. The opposition says it wants to call hundreds of thousands of people from all over Serbia to Belgrade on Thursday, where the suggestion may come up again in earnest.</p>
        <p>The students had earlier blocked traffic in Slavija Square with garbage containers, but police removed them with no conflict.</p>
        <p>At least 30,000 people rallied in Novi Sad and 10,000 gathered in Nis. And 50,000 people in Kragujevac came to hear Mr. Kostunica speak.</p>
        <p>The police also removed some roadblocks elsewhere in Serbia, but the main road south was reported to be blocked near Cacak, a center of the opposition, which was nearly shut down. And the police dispersed a rally of 2,000 protestors in Vranje, making at least a dozen arrests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic usually relies on his special police to counter demonstrations. But some special police units stood by while protesters blocked roads, and at least one special police battalion, the 92nd, based in Belgrade, turned in its riot equipment, the Belgrade press reported today.</p>
        <p>In the northern town of Backa Palanka, local police commanders refused to obey orders from Belgrade to remove a roadblock across a main route. And a report that the head of the special police anti-terrorist units, Zivko Trajkovic, was demoted and shipped south to the town of Kursumlija has not been denied by the state news media.</p>
        <p>State news organizations continued to seethe with protests and petitions demanding ''balanced news,'' but the main organs of state propaganda, Radio Television Serbia and the daily newspaper Politika, were largely unchanged today. Some journalists for Politika called on their colleagues to consider a strike. Some regional state radio stations went on strike, in towns like Novi Sad and Nis, or simply stopped rebroadcasting state news.</p>
        <p>In another sign of trouble for Mr. Milosevic, the Yugoslav dinar weakened further on the black market: it cost 38 dinars to buy one German mark today, up from 28 dinars a month ago. The decline was a result of anxiety and of the government's desire to purchase hard currency to finance necessary imports.</p>
