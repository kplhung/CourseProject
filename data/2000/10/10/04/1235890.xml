        <p>Time Travel</p>
        <p>What might it have been like to dine nearly 2,000 years ago in the great city that bestrode the trade routes between East and West in the Roman Empire? That city was Antioch, now Antakya in southern Turkey. Then the capital of ancient Syria, Antioch ranked with Rome, Carthage and Constantinople in the early Christian era. Home to more than half a million people by the fourth century, it was a city of palaces, public baths, a circus and an amphitheater, and a leader in art, philosophy and religion. By the sixth century, earthquakes, plague and famine made it prey to hordes from the East. Beginning on Sunday, in what is billed as the most ambitious exhibition in its 102-year history, the Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, Mass., will return to the heyday of Antioch with an exhibition of 160 treasures reunited for the first time since their discovery in the 1930's. Including a Roman dining room with mosaics from the Louvre and other major museums, ''Antioch: The Lost Ancient City'' continues through Feb. 4.</p>
        <p>In the Family</p>
        <p>It's father-daughter night at Carnegie Hall at 8 o'clock on Friday when the legendary sitarist, composer, teacher and writer Ravi Shankar will perform with his 19-year-old daughter, the sitarist Anoushka Shankar. The concert, titled ''Full Circle,'' is part of Mr. Shankar's 80th-birthday tour and is the first in Carnegie Hall's world music series.</p>
        <p>Medium and Master</p>
        <p>In the history of photography, Edward Steichen (1879-1973) holds the reputation of having transformed his medium into art. His portraiture was renowned for capturing both inner personality and outer individual. His classic studies of J. P. Morgan, Greta Garbo, Leslie Howard, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich remain indelible, as do his magnificent photographs of structures like the Brooklyn Bridge and the Flatiron Building. Beginning tomorrow, the Whitney Museum of American Art will celebrate Steichen and his work in a retrospective. ''Edward Steichen,'' through Feb. 4, includes not only 200 vintage photographs but also examples of his work as painter, director and curator of exhibitions.</p>
        <p>It's 'Peanuts'</p>
        <p>Look! Over there, isn't that the World War I flying ace? You bet it is, if you visit ''Good Grief!,'' the exhibition that opens on Saturday at the Children's Museum of Manhattan, in the Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street. Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus will be on hand in this interactive show and comic strip display celebrating Charles M. Schulz, the artist who gave them life.</p>
