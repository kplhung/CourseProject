        <p>The tone for today's playoff opener at Busch Stadium was set in the first inning, when the Atlanta Braves performed like impostors.</p>
        <p>The Braves looked nothing like the team that has won nine consecutive division championships. They looked tentative and unsure, like first graders in a school play, wondering who would make the next mistake.</p>
        <p>''We looked like the Bad News Bears out there,'' said Chipper Jones, Atlanta's third baseman, who made a crucial error that helped the St. Louis Cardinals jump to a 6-0 first-inning lead. ''We have nobody to blame but ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Bolstered by their six-run opening inning, and strong relief pitching by committee, the Cardinals held on for a 7-5 victory over the Braves in Game 1 of their three-of-five-game National League division series.</p>
        <p>It was a weird contest that featured several unexpected developments. Greg Maddux, the Braves' four-time Cy Young award winner, gave up nine hits and five earned runs, lasting only four innings. Rick Ankiel, a 21-year-old rookie who got the surprise start for the Cardinals, threw five wild pitches in the third inning, the most by any pitcher during one inning of postseason or regular-season play.</p>
        <p>But the most shocking development was the six-run first inning by St. Louis. A capacity crowd of 52,378 became more giddy with each Cardinal run and each Braves blunder.</p>
        <p>The first five Cardinals reached base against Maddux, but two of those batters should have been retired. Not only did Chipper Jones make a fielding error, but center fielder Andruw Jones failed to catch a fly ball to left-center, allowing the ball to drop between him and left fielder Reggie Sanders.</p>
        <p>That was the beginning of the end for the Braves, who spent the rest of the game playing catch-up, fighting back, but falling short. A run-scoring single by Brian Jordan with one out in the ninth inning pulled Atlanta within 7-5. But with runners on first and second, St. Louis closer Dave Veres ended the game by striking out Sanders and retiring Keith Lockhart on a sharp liner to left field.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Braves were disgusted about starting the postseason with a pathetic inning.</p>
        <p>''We probably played as bad as you could possibly play,'' Manager Bobby Cox said of the first inning.</p>
        <p>Fernando Vina opened the Cardinals' first with a single off the first-base bag that eluded a diving Andres Galarraga. Then, after J. D. Drew singled to right field, moving Vina to third, the Braves began to unravel.</p>
        <p>Jim Edmonds lofted a high fly to left-center field. Andruw Jones and Sanders converged on the ball, but as it tailed away from Jones, he pulled up at the last minute and the ball dropped between them.</p>
        <p>''It was a long way for me to run, but it was my fault,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>The play was ruled a single for Edmonds; Vina scored and Drew moved to second. Will Clark followed with a single to make the score 2-0, driving in Drew and moving Edmonds to third.</p>
        <p>Chipper Jones's fielding error put St. Louis ahead, 3-0. Ray Lankford tapped a slow roller to third base, but Jones bobbled the ball, Edmonds scored and Clark moved to second. After a sacrifice bunt by Edgar Renteria advanced the runners, Carlos Hernandez was intentionally walked, setting the stage for another Braves mistake.</p>
        <p>Placido Polanco smashed a line drive past Maddux for a single to center that scored both Clark and Lankford. As Andruw Jones made a throw to home plate that was too late to get Lankford, Polanco rounded first base and headed for second. Braves catcher Paul Bako made a wild throw to second base for another error, and Hernandez scampered home.</p>
        <p>That quickly, St. Louis had a 6-0 lead. Who could have imagined the Braves, with Maddux on the mound, trailing by six runs in the first inning? The Cardinals' six-run first tied a division series record for most runs scored in one inning.</p>
        <p>Ankiel, however, lost the strike zone in the third inning, and Atlanta scored four runs. Some pitchers lose the strike zone, but Ankiel lost the entire batter's box. Fastballs sailed over the catcher's head, while some curveballs bounced three feet in front of the plate.</p>
        <p>Atlanta's rally began when Ankiel walked Maddux. Rafael Furcal fouled out, but Ankiel wild-pitched Maddux to second base, then wild-pitched him to third. Andruw Jones was walked and wild-pitched to second base, and after Chipper Jones struck out, Ankiel's next wild pitch walked Galarraga, scored Maddux and moved Andruw Jones to third base. Jordan followed with a run-scoring single to make it 6-2. Another wild pitch moved the runners to second and third, Sanders walked and Walt Weiss's bases-loaded single scored Galarraga and Jordan to make the score 6-4. At that point, Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa removed Ankiel in favor of Mike James, who got Javy Lopez to end the inning on a popout.</p>
        <p>Edmonds's solo homer in the fourth inning gave St. Louis a 7-4 lead, and Atlanta was held to one run over the final six innings by relievers James (who got the victory), Mike Timlin, Britt Reames and Veres. So the Braves trail in the series heading into Thursday's Game 2 here.</p>
        <p>''It is a big win any time you beat Maddux,'' Edmonds said. ''To get off to a 1-0 start is a big advantage for us.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>JIM EDMONDS fell hard on his tailbone after chasing down a sharp fifth-inning double by BRIAN JORDAN. Edmonds eventually got up and stayed in the game. ''It's sore, but with a night of rest and tomorrow off, I should be all right,'' Edmonds said.</p>
