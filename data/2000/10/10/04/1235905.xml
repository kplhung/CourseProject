        <p>Web Site, Meet Checkout Line</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Web Site, Meet Checkout Line</p>
        <p>In late August The Weekly World News had quite a scoop.</p>
        <p>This supermarket tabloid reported that one Derek Barnes had discovered a reproduction of an apparently authentic Civil War-era photograph of Union soldiers near the carcass of a recently deceased pterodactyl.</p>
        <p>The photograph, the article said, could indicate that ''prehistoric monsters survived extinction.''</p>
        <p>Funny that Derek Barnes is the name of the lead character of Fox's new science-fiction series ''Freakylinks,'' which begins on Friday night and has Gregg Hale, a producer of ''The Blair Witch Project,'' as a co-creator.</p>
        <p>Even funnier that the picture in question and the story behind it in The Weekly World News was posted months ago on the ''Freakylinks'' Web site (www.freakylinks.com), which follows the adventures of the fictional Mr. Barnes, an investigator of the paranormal (its producers created the picture).</p>
        <p>Certainly Mr. Hale and his new partners at Fox are laughing.</p>
        <p>This would seem to be the pinnacle of what they had hoped to achieve with the Web site for the television program, which was clearly modeled after the one that was set up for ''The Blair Witch Project.''</p>
        <p>The ''Blair Witch'' site was hailed as a marketing breakthrough, building hype for the film before it made its debut by helping to make the plight of its fictional characters -- who disappear in the woods in search of ''The Blair Witch'' -- seem real. The Web site developed a cult following, which gave a boost to the low-budget film. The ''Freakylinks'' producers say they hope that their Web strategy will help them build a sizable audience for the program.</p>
        <p>''Freakylinks'' is about a young man -- Mr. Barnes, played by Ethan Embrey -- who investigates supposedly paranormal events and posts his findings on his Web site.</p>
        <p>The show's creators started the ''Freakylinks'' Web site earlier in the year as if it were really the creation of Derek Barnes, with no explanation that it was connected to a television program. It rapidly became one of the more popular television Web sites. The hitch, of course, is that most who saw it did not know it was television-related.</p>
        <p>It seems that the editors at Weekly World News did not, either.''We're very familiar with freakylinks.com,'' said Leskie Pinson, senior editor. ''We check the site every day.''</p>
        <p>He said he first learned about the site through The Fortian Times, an English publication about the paranormal, which had reported the site's pterodactyl news in May. Told that Derek Barnes was a fictional character from a television show, Mr. Pinson said, ''If I find out this Derek Barnes is fictional, I'll be hopping mad.''</p>
        <p>The producers of the program, David Simkins and Carlos Coto, said that the Web site would continue to be produced as if it were real as it plays off events in the program.</p>
        <p>''The Web site is a little something extra that the audience can open up and engage in at home, before the show starts on a Friday night,'' Mr. Simkins said.</p>
        <p>The Newish Season</p>
        <p>What a long-delayed and strange  television season it has been.</p>
        <p>What with the Olympics on NBC and the presidential campaign debates, the 2000-2001 season has gotten off to a late and stuttering start.</p>
        <p>But judging from the early Nielsen rating returns from the first two nights of the season, which formally began on Sunday, that does not seem to be hurting the big broadcast networks, at least not too much.</p>
        <p>On Sunday night, CBS's new drama ''That's Life,'' starring Ellen Burstyn and Paul Sorvino, was the highest-rated drama of the week, with more than 12 million viewers.</p>
        <p>CBS's new 8:30 p.m. comedy on Monday, ''Yes, Dear,'' seemed to be faring very well, too. According to preliminary Nielsen Media Research data, it was watched by more than 14.5 million people, which would make it the most-watched program in its time period. Yet it was obviously helped along by a strong showing for ''King of Queens'' at 8 p.m., which was watched by 14 million viewers.</p>
        <p>NBC, on the other hand, was not off to a very good start, at least in the comedy department, on Monday night. Its ''Daddio,'' which made its debut in the middle of the last television season, was watched by just about 8 million people, far fewer than tuned in to watch ABC's ''20/20 Downtown'' (12.2 million) or ''King of Queens.'' Its new 8:30 p.m. comedy, ''Tucker,'' about a rascally  child, came in third place in its time period, with 8.4 million people, just ahead of Fox's special ''The Sexiest Bachelor in America,'' with about 8 million. That was not very good news for NBC, whose Olympics coverage was the lowest-rated since 1968.</p>
        <p>But there was some non-negative news for the network. Despite being drubbed by critics, ''Deadline,'' the newspaper drama, did all right. It was watched by about 14 million,  which is considered a respectable, though still third-place, showing.</p>
        <p>Bam! Pow! Zap!</p>
        <p>Do not underestimate the lure of professional wrestling.</p>
        <p>The World Wrestling Federation moved its programming from cable's USA network to MTV and the lesser-known TNN last week, and the debut of its Monday night show,  ''Raw,'' was watched by 7.1 million  on Sept. 25 (ratings data for Monday of this week were not yet available), far more than TNN's average audience of 500,000. The World Wrestling Federation's move to TNN was, of course, fairly well promoted.</p>
        <p>But its move to MTV on Sunday nights was not. Still, the federation's ''Heat,'' shown on MTV for the first time on Sunday at 7 p.m., was watched by 2.5 million people, according to preliminary Nielsen numbers. That made it MTV's third-most watched program, after ''Real World'' and ''Road Rules.''</p>
        <p>Fox Web Site</p>
        <p>Roger E. Ailes, the Fox News Channel chief executive, has agreed to stay with the cable news channel for three years. He said yesterday that he had signed a contract with the News Corporation, which owns the rapidly growing four-year-old channel.</p>
        <p>Crucial to the negotiations, he said, was control of the channel's Web site  (www.foxnews.com). It had been run out of the News Corporation's digital division, wholly separate from the Fox News operation. Now he will be in charge of it.</p>
        <p>''The point of it is that we're creating a Fox News brand, which will be pushed across whatever platforms,'' Mr. Ailes said.</p>
