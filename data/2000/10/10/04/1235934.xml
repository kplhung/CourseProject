        <p>Chinese Internet entrepreneurs and their foreign backers expressed only mild concern today about the potential impact of new rules that, if enforced, could markedly slow development of the young industry here.</p>
        <p>On Monday, China published regulations that require all Internet companies to apply for licenses in the next two months. The new rules say that companies must abide by laws that effectively ban direct foreign investment in the industry and state that Internet companies will be held responsible for content carried on their Web sites.</p>
        <p>The rules also reiterate government bans on various forms of Internet content, including anything deemed subversive, pornographic or related to cults. They say that companies violating the new rules could face fines up to one million yuan, about $120,000, or be shut down.</p>
        <p>But the rules, part of a Chinese government campaign to exert control over the country's information industries, had been expected for some time. Moreover, people in the industries said that most companies are already set up to avoid China's foreign ownership rules and that they exercise self-censorship to avoid conflicts with the government.</p>
        <p>''I don't see any immediate impact on the industry,'' said Tony Zhang, chief executive of Chinanow.com, which produces a series of city guide and entertainment Web sites.</p>
        <p>Still, the new rules, if strictly enforced, could complicate things for Internet companies. For example, the rules require these companies to maintain records of all the information that has been posted on their Web sites and all the users who have connected with their servers for 60 days. If asked, companies must submit those records to government authorities.</p>
        <p>''That's not a situation that any major foreign investor would want to be associated with,'' said Duncan Clark, a telecommunications consultant here, ''let alone a domestic Internet content provider that would be seen as turning in its customers.''</p>
        <p>Another worrisome rule requires companies to seek approval for changes to their business plans -- impractical in the fast-changing, competitive world of the Internet. ''The concept of a fixed business plan is archaic,'' Mr. Duncan said.</p>
        <p>Well-financed companies are likely to be able to navigate the new rules, even if strictly enforced. ''But there is a cost associated with this more formal regulation of the sector,'' said David Williams, a Hong Kong-based partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson ePlanet Ventures, a venture capital firm. ''And it will be borne mostly by the start-ups which are most cash-poor and, among those, the start-ups which don't have access to proper legal advice.''</p>
        <p>Under current law, foreigners are banned from investing directly in the Internet, although China has already agreed to allow 49 percent direct ownership of Internet content providers once it enters the World Trade Organization, as expected within the next few months. That is to increase to 50 percent two years later.</p>
        <p>To circumvent the current ban, most foreign investors involved in the industry have bought stakes in companies incorporated in the Cayman Islands or other offshore havens from regulation. Such offshore companies typically hold licensing agreements with Chinese companies that own the Web sites.</p>
        <p>China has given the strategy tacit approval by allowing three Internet companies using the structure to list their shares abroad. And China's Internet entrepreneurs say the government has little to gain by closing the loophole now. Any regulations that slow a company's access to capital, even if only by a few weeks, could put Chinese companies at a disadvantage to more nimble companies with headquarters abroad.</p>
        <p>If enforced, the complicated new licensing requirements could also slow the industry. Under the rules, Internet companies that provide news or supply information about education, health care, pharmaceutical products and medical instruments must be approved by regulatory agencies. In addition to the ministry of information industries, those agencies include government departments that regulate news, publishing, education, public health, pharmaceuticals, industry and commerce, public security and national defense.</p>
        <p>But many Internet executives noted that the new rules, which were recently approved by the State Council, China's cabinet, were drafted when the industry was growing so fast that regulators were having trouble keeping up with what was going on. Growth has since slowed as investors' appetite for the industry cooled. ''The market isn't overheated now, so I don't see a necessity for the government to crack down now,'' Mr. Zhang of Chinanow.com said.</p>
