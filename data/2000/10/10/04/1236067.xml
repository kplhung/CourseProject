        <p>Andrew Golota and his handlers said yesterday that the heavyweight was ready to fight a clean fight against Mike Tyson on Oct. 20 at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich. No low blows. No biting. No dirty business. As long as Tyson behaves, so will Golota.</p>
        <p>But if the fight turns dirty, then Andrew will do what he has to do, said Gary Shaw, chief-executive-officer of Main Events, Golota's promoter.</p>

        <p>Both Tyson, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, and Golota, the 32-year-old Polish heavyweight, have behaved badly in the ring. Three years ago, Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ear; Golota bit Samson Po'uha on the shoulder during a bout in 1995. Golota has twice been disqualified for hitting low; Tyson was nearly disqualified in his last bout for hitting late.</p>
