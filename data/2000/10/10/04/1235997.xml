        <p>Negotiators from the House and Senate agreed today to push states to adopt a tough national standard for drunken driving, threatening to withhold some federal highway aid to states that balk.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, contained in a $57.9 billion spending measure for federal transportation programs, states will be given two years to adopt a definition of drunken driving that declares drivers legally drunk when their blood alcohol level reaches 0.08 percent, meaning that eight one-hundredths of 1 percent of the liquid in their bloodstream is alcohol.</p>
        <p>States that fail to embrace this stringent standard by October 2003 will lose 2 percent of their federal highway financing in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 of that year, 4 percent of that money the next fiscal year, 6 percent the next and 8 percent the next.</p>
        <p>Any state that enacts the standard of a 0.08 blood alcohol level by the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2006, will regain any money that had been withheld. Currently, 18 states and the District of Columbia have a 0.08 blood alcohol level standard for drunken driving, while the rest of the states set it at the higher level or leave it up to arresting officers to determine inebriation, Department of Transportation officials said.</p>
        <p>Though the transportation bill must still be passed by the House and the Senate, today's agreement virtually assures that the measure will become law.</p>
        <p>As a result, the United States will have a definition of drunken driving that is as strict as that in Australia, Canada and Japan, Clinton administration officials said.</p>
        <p>''America has been behind on this so we're so pleased to see us catch up and be where we need to be,'' said Dr. Sue Bailey, acting head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has lobbied for the tough standard. ''The science is clear. You are impaired at 0.08, and you need to be off the highways.''</p>
        <p>Though the amount of alcohol ingested to reach a blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent varies from person to person, in general, a 170-pound man would have to consume five 12-ounce beers in two hours; a 120-pound woman generally must drink three 12-ounce beers over two hours to reach that level.</p>
        <p>For a 170-pound man, the difference between a 0.08 blood alcohol level and a 0.10 level is generally one additional 12-ounce beer ingested during a two-hour period. For a 120-pound woman the difference is, on average, an additional six ounces of beer.</p>
        <p>The new standard has bipartisan support and was written by Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, and Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, and has strong support from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a group that has been able to mobilize strong pressure at the grass-roots level for overhaul of laws dealing with drunken driving.</p>
        <p>The new standards were vigorously fought by the liquor industry, including companies making and distributing distilled spirits, wine and beer. It was also strongly opposed by state officials, including the National Governors' Association and the National League of Cities, which saw the measure as a federal intrusion into state affairs.</p>
        <p>Roger M. Breske, a state senator in Wisconsin, said in an interview  that his state already had a comprehensive program that, among other things, required a sobriety test after every traffic accident, banned open alcohol containers in moving vehicles and allowed judges to reduce the definition to 0.02 for people convicted of driving while intoxicated. The state, however, has a blood alcohol standard of 0.10.</p>
        <p>''I have no intention to caving in to Washington's demands,'' said Mr. Breske, who in addition to being a legislator is a former president of the Tavern League of Wisconsin, a trade association. ''If Senator Lautenberg and Congressman Wolf want to address drunk driving in Wisconsin, I invite them to come here and run for my seat.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the drunken-driving standard, the transportation bill also includes a provision that allows the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to issue ratings for vehicles, including cars, pick-up trucks, sport minivans and sport utility vehicles, on their propensity to roll over. The rating will be given on a one-to-five-star basis, with one star being given to vehicles that are most likely to roll over and five stars awarded to the most stable.</p>
        <p>In addition to the agreement reached on the transportation bill, Congress took these actions:</p>
        <p>House-Senate conferees attached an amendment to the transportation bill to increase financing for the Internal Revenue Service by $215 million. The negotiators also added $37 million to the measure to bolster counterterrorism efforts. The Clinton administration had been pushing for the amendment, which had been part of a spending bill to finance the Treasury Department that failed last week in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The House overwhelmingly approved a House-Senate agreement on an $18.8 billion measure to finance a variety of programs run by the Interior Department as well as provide money for the National Endowment for the Arts, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
        <p>The measure also includes the establishment of a $12 billion account to be financed over a six-year period for land conservation that will include acquiring land for national parks and national monuments, provide money for urban parks and historic sites and allocate money to establish or expand wildlife refuges.</p>
        <p>The House approved a stop-gap spending measure to keep the government running through Oct. 14 while Congress finishes its work on 11 spending bills.</p>
