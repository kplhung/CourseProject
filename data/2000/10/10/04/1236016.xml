        <p>''There will be some who will think this is a form of narcolepsy-inducing,'' Dan Rather said on CBS just seconds after the presidential debate ended, with fumbled grammar but no hyperbole.</p>
        <p>He quickly added that the debate mattered because serious issues had been addressed, but he was right to observe its snoozy style.</p>
        <p>In a campaign that has been wallowing in soft-focus talk-show television, the first face-to-face debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush was the most rigidly formatted of their three planned meetings, and as a result the candidates' demeanors were often as stiff as the lecterns they stood behind.</p>
        <p>Though they flung tough accusations at each other, their cautious styles suggested that they were getting this most stiffly presidential (and least Oprah-like) of the debates out of the way. It was the Bush campaign that tried to replace this traditional format with more freewheeling alternatives, but as it turned out, the staid approach worked to neither candidate's advantage.</p>
        <p>The pre-debate spin was that Mr. Gore had to avoid going on a harsh attack that might alienate viewers. He went after Mr. Bush's ideas, but his restraint meant he could not capitalize on the more dynamic image he had been building since the conventions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had to avoid fumbling his words and stretching his answers to fill the time, weaknesses he displayed in the Republican primary debates. The shadow of those early debates only threatened seriously when he seemed to struggle pronouncing Slobodan Milosevic's last name, and to vamp to fill his time when asked how the United States should respond to Mr. Milosevic's refusal to concede the Yugoslav election. The Russians should use their influence, he said at the start and at the end of his answer.</p>
        <p>At times the candidates appeared on a split screen so viewers could see the opponent's reactions, but how and when the two were displayed side by side differed among networks. A pool camera fed several images to the networks, and the individual directors chose how to use them. This had the subtle effect of interrupting the candidates' sincerest looks into the camera (Mr. Bush seemed especially conscious of doing this).</p>
        <p>The camera choices seemed to be determined not by any political tilt, but by a desperate search for action.</p>
        <p>Throughout the debate, Mr. Bush had more canned lines (he accused Mr. Gore of having ''fuzzy math'' several times), drank more water, sniffed and twisted up his mouth. Mr. Gore sighed, shook his head, was less physically active and came equipped with his own stock phrases (he would put ''Social Security in a lockbox,'' he said).</p>
        <p>As soon as the debate ended, the campaign's soft focus returned. The trappings around the event (including Mr. Gore's much publicized use of ordinary voters as advisers) threatened to turn the debate into the latest in reality television. The candidates may have been on stage in Boston, but several networks decided that the postgame action was in Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>NBC, CNN and ABC all turned to focus groups of undecided voters in that crucial, up-for-grabs state. But few of the undecided voters said that they had made up their minds as a result of the debate.</p>
        <p>The vice-presidential candidates, Dick Cheney and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, made the rounds of networks, appearing on CBS, CNN and MSNBC (and the NBC affiliates that chose to carry the debate rather than baseball). ABC saved them for ''Nightline,'' but there wasn't much point in anyone going through that exercise.</p>
        <p>The vice-presidential candidates and the professional spinners were even less valuable than the so-called real people in the focus groups.</p>
        <p>''Why am I not surprised to hear you say that?'' Tom Brokaw of NBC asked Mr. Lieberman after he said something wonderful about Mr. Gore's performance.</p>
        <p>Even the network commentators, usually so ready to declare a winner in the presidential horse race, were skittish after this one. ''Gore did better in the debate; Bush got a bigger boost,'' said Bill Schneider of CNN. Instant polls by CNN and ABC, among others, suggested little movement in voters' opinions after the debate. After days of shouting that this might be the decisive moment in the campaign, the commentators seemed like the little boy who cried wolf. Next time they'll say, this is the decisive moment, we mean it.</p>
