        <p>Slobodan Milosevic is not relinquishing power easily. Ten days after voters decisively elected Vojislav Kostunica as Yugoslavia's new president, Mr. Milosevic continues to bluster and threaten, proceeding with plans to hold a meaningless runoff vote this Sunday. Mr. Kostunica and his allies are right to disparage the runoff and insist on immediate recognition of his victory. Foreign governments, especially Russia's, must persuade Mr. Milosevic to yield power without further delay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic is not the first tyrant to face rejection by his people, and he should reflect on some relevant history. Most of Yugoslavia's Central and Eastern European neighbors experienced similar upheavals when the Soviet empire collapsed in 1989. In Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia, discredited Communist leaders  abandoned power without subjecting their countries to bloodshed. In Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu tried to hold on by force. After his security troops were fractured in bloody fighting, Mr. Ceausescu was executed along with his powerful and detested wife.</p>

        <p>Slobodan Milosevic is not relinquishing power easily. Ten days after voters decisively elected Vojislav Kostunica as Yugoslavia's new president, Mr. Milosevic continues to bluster and threaten, proceeding with plans to hold a meaningless runoff vote this Sunday. Mr. Kostunica and his allies are right to disparage the runoff and insist on immediate recognition of his victory. Foreign governments, especially Russia's, must persuade Mr. Milosevic to yield power without further delay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic is not the first tyrant to face rejection by his people, and he should reflect on some relevant history. Most of Yugoslavia's Central and Eastern European neighbors experienced similar upheavals when the Soviet empire collapsed in 1989. In Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia, discredited Communist leaders  abandoned power without subjecting their countries to bloodshed. In Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu tried to hold on by force. After his security troops were fractured in bloody fighting, Mr. Ceausescu was executed along with his powerful and detested wife.</p>
        <p>Another instructive example comes from the Philippines in 1986, where Ferdinand Marcos declared victory in an election he had clearly lost to Corazon Aquino. Soon after, important army leaders turned against the dictator, declaring they would not fight their own people to prolong his fraudulent claim on power. Mr. Marcos fled.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Kostunica's urging, Yugoslavs are using the same forms of nonviolent resistance that have helped pry dictators from power elsewhere. Recent days have seen protest marches, campus boycotts and strikes in strategic industries like coal mining. Yesterday, Milosevic allies rashly threatened to crush such protests by force and arrest opposition leaders. But security forces may refuse to repress their fellow citizens on behalf of a defeated dictator.</p>
        <p>Washington and Western European leaders quickly and correctly recognized Mr. Kostunica's victory. Russia, the foreign power with the most influence in Belgrade, has been more equivocal. President Vladimir Putin has signaled to foreign leaders that he has no fondness for Mr. Milosevic. But publicly he has remained neutral, accepting the idea of a runoff and personally offering to mediate talks between the two contenders.</p>
        <p>Such neutrality will prolong the crisis, at Yugoslavia's expense. Mr. Milosevic has brought his country international shame, military humiliation and painful economic isolation. The voters have repudiated him. Russia should now join with other countries in denouncing the runoff and recognizing Mr. Kostunica's clear victory.</p>
