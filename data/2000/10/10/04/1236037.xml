        <p>Even the Yankees who made mistakes tonight in Game 1 of the playoffs kept repeating the same words. We played well, Jorge Posada said. We played well, Luis Sojo said.</p>
        <p>If they really feel that way, then their late-season collapse has diminished their own high standards. But it may be that the Yankees are uttering the mantra -- we played well, they said, over and over -- because the alternative is too painful.</p>
        <p>The Yankees played horribly in Game 1 and lost to Oakland, 5-3, in the three-of-five-game division series. They played the way they did in the third week of September, the fourth week of September, the first day of October. They wanted a fresh start in the playoffs to pursue their third consecutive championship, and instead they resumed their artful imitation of a second-division team, with a woefully thin bullpen and a sporadic offense.</p>
        <p>The Yankees took an early lead, but the Athletics patiently wore down Roger Clemens and scored three runs in the fifth, another in the sixth and added a late run; Ramon Hernandez, Oakland's No. 9 hitter, had two crucial hits against Clemens.</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte will pitch Game 2 for the Yankees tonight, against Oakland's Kevin Appier.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt about it, we've got to win that game tomorrow,'' said Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder.</p>
        <p>Oakland Manager Art Howe said, ''I don't know about a big dent, but we certainly wanted to win this game.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees needed this game, badly; at the very least, some of them acknowledged in the final days of the season, they needed to play well to start this series, as a reminder that they were capable of good baseball.</p>
        <p>They had runners at first and second and nobody out in the first inning against Oakland's Gil Heredia and couldn't score, but in the next inning, the Yankees came back to score two runs after there were two out and no one on base. Sojo ripped a run-scoring double to give the Yankees their first lead since Sept. 25, and Scott Brosius doubled home Sojo, for his first run batted in since Sept. 10. Clemens shut out the Athletics on one hit through the first four innings; it was all going according to plan.</p>
        <p>But Oakland had put one crack in the Yankees, and it was widening into the middle innings. The Athletics' patient lineup had forced Clemens to throw 65 pitches in the first four innings, an ominous pace for the Yankees, whose middle relief is extremely weak because of the injuries to Ramiro Mendoza and Jason Grimsley. Yankees Manager Joe Torre had hoped that Clemens would pitch deep into the game and hand a lead to his setup men, Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson.</p>
        <p>Clemens pulled the bill of his cap a little lower than usual in the first innings and held his glove high, so that if you were standing at home plate with a bat in your hands, his face was almost obscured, all except for the eyes, like a burglar wearing a ski mask.</p>
        <p>His stuff was good but not great; his four-seam fastball was 94 to 95 miles an hour, and his slider was breaking sharply. His splitter moved benignly, however, horizontally rather than vertically, and this made it harder for him to finish off left-handed hitters than he would have preferred.</p>
        <p>''I felt good out there,'' Clemens said. ''In control.''</p>
        <p>Still, he began to struggle in the fifth. Eric Chavez singled and Clemens walked Jeremy Giambi and, when Hernandez singled to right field, the Oakland third-base coach, Ron Washington, waved Chavez home. Paul O'Neill fielded the rolling single and fired toward home plate, and if his throw had been on line, Chavez probably would have been out.</p>
        <p>But O'Neill has not thrown straight since injuring his hip last month, something that the Oakland scouts had probably seen and reported to Washington. Chavez crossed home plate standing.</p>
        <p>Terrence Long then grounded to second, and when Hernandez stopped between first and second, Sojo fired to first for one out, hoping that Tino Martinez would cut down Hernandez at second. Sojo's gambit failed, however, as Hernandez dived safely into second, and the Athletics had runners at second and third with one out.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I threw the ball too soon to first,'' Sojo said. ''I should've chased him a little bit more.''</p>
        <p>Randy Velarde bounced a single through the left side of the infield to score Giambi. Clemens threw a splitter that dived. Posada reached down haphazardly and allowed it to bounce between his legs, and Hernandez crossed home plate on what was ruled a wild pitch.</p>
        <p>''I've got to keep that in front of me,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees tied the score in the sixth, manufacturing a run after Williams led off with a double.</p>
        <p>The first two Oakland batters went down in the sixth. Clemens had thrown more than 100 pitches. He was tiring; he had been frustrated with the compact strike zone of the home plate umpire, Tim Welke. But nobody was warming up in the bullpen.</p>
        <p>Oakland had two outs and Chavez singled to left. Sweat dripped down Clemens's face; he paused repeatedly between pitches, looking like a marathon runner in the 26th mile.</p>
        <p>Giambi singled, Chavez racing into third. Nobody was warming up in the bullpen.</p>
        <p>The right-handed-hitting Hernandez was next. Clemens faked a throw to third, looked at the runner at first and stepped off, then did it again; a lot of pitchers do this when they are tiring. Nobody was warming up in the bullpen.</p>
        <p>Clemens fired a pitch to the outside part of the plate and Hernandez drove it to right field, in O'Neill's direction. The liner shot past him, bouncing against the wall. Chavez scored easily with the go-ahead run, and the Yankees managed to cut down Giambi with a perfect relay to the plate. But they were trailing now, on the road, in jeopardy of losing for the eighth straight game.</p>
        <p>Clemens was relieved by Stanton for the seventh -- ''My pitch count got up, that's the main reason,'' Clemens said -- and in that inning, the Athletics executed a double steal when Stanton failed to check the runners. Oakland didn't score in that inning, but did in the eighth after a runner advanced on a wild pitch. At the moment reporters were allowed into the clubhouse, Posada was looking at the webbing of his glove.</p>
        <p>''I thought we played hard,'' Clemens said.</p>
        <p>''I think we played a good game,'' Derek Jeter said.</p>
