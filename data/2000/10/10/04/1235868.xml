        <p>A store that sells both eyeglasses and chocolate may be unusual enough, but that is not the whole story behind Lunettes et Chocolat, a new boutique at 25 Prince Street (Elizabeth Street). It also has vintage Gucci handbags and nougats, and one-of-a-kind felt hats and scones.</p>

        <p>A store that sells both eyeglasses and chocolate may be unusual enough, but that is not the whole story behind Lunettes et Chocolat, a new boutique at 25 Prince Street (Elizabeth Street). It also has vintage Gucci handbags and nougats, and one-of-a-kind felt hats and scones.</p>
        <p>Selima Salaun, who owns eyeglass and accessories shops in New York, Los Angeles and Paris, has teamed up with a friend, Maribel Lieberman, a caterer, who has added sweets to this store's inventory. Ms. Lieberman's line includes excellent chocolates, with stand-out  truffles ($48 a pound) and white chocolate squares embedded with bits of coffee bean, lime or raspberry ($15 a pound). There are also candies from around the world, including langues de chat (slender chocolate ovals) from Demel in Vienna ($38), Provencal specialties ($6 and up), Swiss crystallized pansies ($5 each) and Japanese confections ($4 and up). The shop has a coffee bar, where buttery scones are served with homemade jam and double cream ($8) and where shoppers can try out their new eyeglass frames, in colors from lemon drop to licorice.</p>
