        <p>THE audience for cookbooks by celebrity chefs is usually limited to people who buy them just to look at the pictures, to the lucky few who consider cooking mainly a hobby and especially to those hobbyists who live in large cities. That is, places where one can easily buy special mushrooms like cepes, chanterelles and mousserons; cod with the skin on; and ingredients like elderflowers. You get the drift.</p>
        <p>What brings these challenges to mind is ''Gordon Ramsay, a Chef for All Seasons,'' about and by England's chef of the moment. The book, published first in England and now here by Ten Speed Press, has, like other oeuvres de chef, gorgeous pictures that make you reach for a pan.

        <p>THE audience for cookbooks by celebrity chefs is usually limited to people who buy them just to look at the pictures, to the lucky few who consider cooking mainly a hobby and especially to those hobbyists who live in large cities. That is, places where one can easily buy special mushrooms like cepes, chanterelles and mousserons; cod with the skin on; and ingredients like elderflowers. You get the drift.</p>
        <p>What brings these challenges to mind is ''Gordon Ramsay, a Chef for All Seasons,'' about and by England's chef of the moment. The book, published first in England and now here by Ten Speed Press, has, like other oeuvres de chef, gorgeous pictures that make you reach for a pan. But this one has things going for it that the others do not.</p>
        <p>For one, the reader does not have to be a highly skilled kitchen technician. Because Mr. Ramsay's eponymous restaurant in London has two Michelin stars, I assume the dishes he presents there are considerably more sophisticated than those in the book.  For the home cook, having simpler recipes is not such a bad thing. Most of Mr. Ramsay's recipes are easy to do, even though they are often time consuming.</p>
        <p>Unlike most celebrity chef cookbooks, Mr. Ramsay's never requires the home cook to prepare three or four ''starters'' before tackling the main dish.</p>
        <p>He also gives a number of useful tips, like simmering cauliflower in milk and water to lessen its odor.</p>
        <p>But before trying a recipe, it would be wise for the reader to scrutinize the ingredient list. Apparently no one told Mr. Ramsay or his California publisher that even though Americans speak the same language as the English, they have different ingredients. It would be helpful if some substitutes were offered -- for those elderflowers, for example, which make a delicious drink but which I have never found on this side of the pond.</p>
        <p>A recipe for cod with fried potatoes and mustard lentils was nice, though I thought the dish needed more vinaigrette. It also took 1 hour and 10 minutes to prepare, a bit  much for a weeknight. Incidentally, I never found cod with skin, so I made it with skinless fillets and it was fine.</p>
        <p>Rice pudding with autumn fruits sounds promising, but suffers from a common British error, as far as Americans are concerned: it was achingly sweet. It could be easily fixed by reducing the sugar.</p>
        <p>I loved the risotto with pancetta and pumpkin, but the two and a half cups of chicken stock it called for was not nearly enough. One cup of arborio routinely absorbs close to four cups of stock.</p>
        <p>For $35, a book should cook better than this. But then, the pictures are great.</p>
        <p>COD WITH CRISP POTATOES AND MUSTARD LENTILS  Adapted from ''Gordon Ramsay, a Chef for All Seasons''  Time: 1 hour 10 minutes</p>
        <p>1 pound red potatoes, scrubbed  6 tablespoons olive oil  Sea salt and ground black pepper  4 cod fillets, about 4 ounces each</p>
        <p>1/2 cup de Puy lentils  1 carrot, cut in quarters</p>
        <p>1/2 small onion  1 small stalk celery, halved  Vinaigrette:  1/4 cup each olive oil and peanut oil; 1 tablespoon each sherry vinegar and white wine vinegar; lemon juice to taste  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  1 tablespoon unsalted butter  1 shallot, minced  1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and dried  1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives.</p>
        <p>1. Boil potatoes until just tender. Cool, peel and dice. Toss with 1 tablespoon oil, and season with salt and pepper. Season cod on one side, rubbing in. Set aside for  1/2 hour.</p>
        <p>2. Place lentils in a saucepan with carrot, onion and celery. Cover with cold water; bring to a boil, then simmer 15 minutes.  Drain, discarding vegetables.</p>
        <p>3. Prepare vinaigrette. Season three tablespoons of it with the mustard. (Save the rest for another purpose.) Heat 1 tablespoon oil and the butter in a frying pan; saute shallots until softened. Remove from pan, and set aside.</p>
        <p>4. In same pan, add another tablespoon oil. Saute potatoes until golden. Remove from pan, and mix with shallots and capers.</p>
        <p>5. Wipe out pan and heat remaining oil. Add fish, skin side down, and cook about 5 minutes. Turn and brown second side.</p>
        <p>6. Reheat lentils. Season, and stir in mustard vinaigrette and chives. Top each serving of fish with potatoes and lentils.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
