      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To American moviegoers, a jujube is the colorful jellylike candy that sticks  to your teeth. But a jujube is also a smooth-skinned, walnut-size subtropical fruit that is used in Chinese and Indian cooking.</p>
        <p>For the interested shopper, Dean &amp; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street) is selling fresh jujubes for $8 a pound (about 20). When green they are quite firm, and the pale, somewhat mealy flesh suggests a slightly astringent apple. As they ripen, they turn a rusty color and become sweeter. They're usually dried and used in desserts. Chinese groceries sell the dried ones, sometimes labeled ''red dates.''</p>

        <p>Too impatient to wait until they ripened and shriveled, I simmered a pound of fresh jujubes in two cups of water with a half cup of sugar, a two-inch piece of vanilla bean and 10 whole cloves for 30 minutes, then let them cool in the syrup overnight. They became mellow and tender, a curiosity to add to a fruit compote or to serve alongside roast pork -- but not to take to the movies.</p>
