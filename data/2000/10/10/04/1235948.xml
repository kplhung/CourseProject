        <p>Reassured by signs that economic growth is moderating to a sustainable pace, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, but warned that low unemployment and high oil prices could still lead to a jump in inflation.</p>
        <p>In its last meeting before Election Day, the Fed said it would hold its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks at 6.5 percent, where it has been since May. It was the third consecutive meeting at which the Fed kept monetary policy on hold, after raising rates by 1.75 percentage points in six steps starting in June of last year.</p>

        <p>Reassured by signs that economic growth is moderating to a sustainable pace, the Federal Reserve voted today to hold interest rates steady, but warned that low unemployment and high oil prices could still lead to a jump in inflation.</p>
        <p>In its last meeting before Election Day, the Fed said it would hold its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks at 6.5 percent, where it has been since May. It was the third consecutive meeting at which the Fed kept monetary policy on hold, after raising rates by 1.75 percentage points in six steps starting in June of last year.</p>
        <p>In announcing its decision, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee suggested that the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth had increased in recent years and that the expansion had slowed to near that range. But its statement was laden with caveats, and gave no indication that the Fed had begun thinking about cutting rates, as some investors had been hoping it would.</p>
        <p>Faced with the likelihood that rates would remain steady at best in coming months and might even rise, investors sent stock prices down after the Fed's announcement.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up more than 100 points before the release of the Fed statement around 2:15, lost most of its gains and closed at 10,719.74, up 19.61 points for the day. The Nasdaq composite index fell 113.07 points, to 3,455.83. Prices of long-term government bonds fell.</p>
        <p>Most indicators in the last few months have suggested that the business expansion, now in its 10th year, is slowing somewhat from its torrid pace late last year and earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The Commerce Department reported today that sales of new single-family homes declined by 3 percent in August and the Conference Board said its index of leading indicators declined 0.1 percent in August after falling 0.2 percent in July.</p>
        <p>At the same time, inflation by most measures has remained subdued. And although the issue is still subject to considerable debate among economists, Fed officials have become increasingly convinced that the technology-driven upturn in the growth rate of productivity -- the most important measure of efficiency and a critical indicator of long-term economic potential -- is likely to continue for some time.</p>
        <p>As productivity improves, businesses can pay workers more and maintain their profits without raising prices.</p>
        <p>Still, with unemployment at 4.1 percent, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has remained concerned that employers might soon have to begin bidding up wages to find the workers they need, potentially pushing prices up.</p>
        <p>And though the surge in oil prices this year has not filtered through the entire economy, it is pushing up some broad measures of inflation and increasing the risk that workers, business executives and investors will begin assuming that higher inflation is inevitable.</p>
        <p>In its statement, the Fed noted that recent economic reports indicate ''that the expansion of aggregate demand has moderated to a pace closer to the enhanced rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce.''</p>
        <p>Gains in productivity ''also continue to help contain costs and hold down underlying price pressures,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the statement said, ''utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level,'' and higher oil prices pose ''a risk of raising inflation expectations.''</p>
        <p>Using its boilerplate language to signal that it remains more likely to raise rates in the future than to cut them, the Fed said that ''the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the future.''</p>
        <p>Economists said the Fed was now likely to remain on hold for months or possibly through next year, since the economy seems to have achieved or to be close to the proverbial soft landing -- a slowdown sufficient to squelch inflation pressures without endangering the expansion.</p>
        <p>After growing 8.3 percent in last year's fourth quarter, 4.8 percent in the first quarter and 5.6 percent in the second quarter, the economy is projected by many analysts to have expanded at about 3.5 percent in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>Fed officials think the economy's long-term noninflationary growth rate is around 4 percent. Fed policy next year is likely to hinge on whether growth stays below that level or accelerates above it again.</p>
        <p>''I'm almost willing to say we've landed, but that's not the end of the story, it's the beginning,'' said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. ''You either refuel or you get hit with something else.''</p>
        <p>There are several signs that the economy could take off again. Consumer spending has shown considerable resilience, even though the stock market has run out of steam this year, and mortgage rates have fallen substantially in recent months, suggesting that housing could continue to support strong growth rates.</p>
        <p>Energy prices are another wild card, one that the Fed made clear it remains concerned about.</p>
        <p>But Stephen D. Slifer, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers, said energy accounted for 7 percent of economic output now, down from 14 percent in 1980, so the economy was far less vulnerable to an oil price shock than it used to be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slifer said President Clinton's willingness to tap the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve should also limit the chances of any big spike in oil prices, which in any case have been coming down somewhat from their recent peak a few weeks ago.</p>
