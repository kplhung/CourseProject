        <p>Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst and Bear, Stearns are having trouble financing their $2.9 billion takeover bid for the building materials manufacturer Johns Manville, according to bankers close to the transaction. The bankers said they expected Manville to report disappointing earnings for the third quarter, making it tough to generate enthusiasm in the capital markets to lend money to the buyout.</p>
        <p>It is likely that the terms of the Manville acquisition will be reworked, with either a reduction in the $15.63 a share purchase price or an increase in the amount of cash that Hicks, Muse and Bear, Stearns will need to invest to get the deal done, the bankers said.</p>
        <p>Investment bankers promoted the acquisition, announced in June, as heralding a new wave of leveraged buyouts as investors try to take advantage of a declining stock market to make bargain purchases. Since then, a handful of other leveraged buyouts have been announced, including Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's $3.8 billion offer for IBP Inc., a meatpacker, on Monday.</p>
        <p>Hicks Muse, a Dallas-based leveraged-buyout firm, and Bear, Stearns, an investment bank in New York, planned to finance their acquisition of Denver-based Johns Manville with $2.35 billion in senior loans and high-yield debt, according to documents Manville filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Of that amount, $1.75 billion was to be raised in the loan market, with the rest to come from $600 million in junk bonds.</p>
        <p>Bankers are closely tracking the Manville financing to gauge whether investors are willing to finance transactions other than telecommunications ventures, which have dominated the leveraged financing market in recent months.</p>
        <p>Hicks, Muse and Bear, Stearns are trying to raise money at a time when investors in leveraged loans and junk bonds are quite selective, because of concerns about rising corporate defaults, bankers said. In such a market, Manville's anticipated decline in profits makes the deal tough to sell.</p>
        <p>Manville has been hurt by higher energy prices, which drive up its raw materials costs, as well as slower housing starts and the decline in the euro. ''They are confronting the same issues as lots of other industrial companies,'' said one executive involved in the deal. ''Their performance will be affected for the quarter; how substantially is not clear.'' A spokesman for Manville declined to comment, as did spokesmen for Bear, Stearns and Hicks, Muse.</p>
        <p>Bear, Stearns has committed to provide $150 million for its share of the deal's $500 million in equity, with the balance to come from Hicks, Muse. The takeover represents the largest investment to date by Bear's merchant banking group, which was formed in 1997.</p>
        <p>Bear, Stearns had committed to underwrite the $1.75 billion bank loan, so if the firm cannot find other lenders willing to participate in the loan it would be obligated to finance the entire amount. Bear also committed to a $600 million bridge loan, which it planned to replace with the high-yield financing. The combined bank and bridge loans represent the largest capital commitment ever made by the firm, which has traditionally been wary of taking risks with its cash.</p>
        <p>One banker close to the deal said that Bear was trying to reduce its risk by bringing in other banks -- possibly Chase Manhattan and First Union -- to help finance the transaction. It was likely, the banker said, that the banks would take part only if Hicks, Muse and Bear, Stearns agreed to put in more of their own cash, thus reducing the total amount of debt backing the deal. Officials at both banks declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Another possibility, said an executive involved in structuring the deal, is that the price of the Manville acquisition is renegotiated altogether, given the company's worsening performance. At $11.18 a share, the stock is trading 28 percent below the $15.63 a share that Hicks, Muse and Bear, Stearns have offered to pay. ''In a difficult environment such as this, you need to invest more equity, but, at the same time, why would you put more money in at a time like this?'' explained the executive.</p>
        <p>The difficulty in financing the deal is just the latest wrinkle confronting Hicks, Muse, which has had much bad publicity in recent months over $1.3 billion in investments it made in six telecommunications companies last year and earlier this year. Those investments were financed with convertible preferred stock, but the common shares of all but one of the companies have since declined, reducing the value of the convertible stock. Hicks, Muse is also struggling to resuscitate its $1.5 billion acquisition of Regal Cinemas, made together with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, after an industrywide building binge.</p>
        <p>These problems come as Hicks,  Muse is trying to raise a $4.5 billion buyout fund, the firm's fifth such partnership. Any problems raising the fund could prove complicated for Hicks, Muse, which has been financing some recent deals using a bridge loan of over $1 billion provided by Chase and a syndicate of seven other lenders. If Hicks were significantly delayed in raising the fund, it could be on the hook to the banks for the sum it committed to the Manville deal and other recent acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Hicks, Muse is likely to raise far more than the banks have lent it, despite the bad publicity, said a Wall Street executive who has spoken to Hicks, Muse partners. Indeed, the executive said the firm was confident it would close on the first stage of its fund-raising toward the end of this month, with commitments from investors north of $2 billion.</p>
        <p>''They've had winners and losers in the past, but over all they've had very favorable returns,'' said William Quinn, president of the pension management arm of AMR, which has been an investor with Hicks Muse since the firm was founded in 1989. ''We have a high level of confidence in them.''</p>
        <p>Still, he added, ''the final close of the fund isn't until the spring, and we will make a decision at that time.''</p>
