        <p>On several issues in the debate, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush stood on principles that have divided their parties for decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush favored large tax cuts, Mr. Gore more federal spending. Mr. Gore stood for abortion rights, Mr. Bush did not. Mr. Gore advocated expanding Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Bush pressed for partial privatization of the programs.</p>
        <p>They challenged each other's logic and budget numbers, offering a array of charges and countercharges, numbers and statistics, diplomatic catch-phrases, military jargon and economic theories. But the basic disagreement was over philosophy.</p>
        <p>Here is an examination of the candidates' positions on many of the issues that were points of contention in the debate and have been throughout the election year.</p>
        <p>Several times in the debate, the two men clashed over the scope of America's role in the world -- most dramatically over the use of American troops.</p>
        <p>''The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of  troops,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He believes in nation-building.''</p>
        <p>''I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and, therefore, prevent war from happening in the first place,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore started their discussion from a point of agreement: They said troops should be committed only to those places where American interests and security were at stake. But they defined those interests differently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore seemed to indicate that sometimes the United States would need to put itself at risk to prevent a humanitarian disaster.</p>
        <p>Both agreed that they would not send troops to Serbia to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Mr. Bush said that he would use diplomacy, and get Russia to tell Mr. Milosevic that the time has come for him to surrender his office in the wake of his defeat in an election last week. Mr. Gore shot back that Russia has not yet agreed that Mr. Milosevic should leave office without a runoff election.</p>
