      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There are a number of ways to determine whether fish has reached the proper degree of doneness. Cooking it 10 minutes for every inch of thickness is an old standby, as is prodding it to see if it flakes. But both methods often guarantee overcooking. Now there's Captain Quackenbush's Fish Cooking Testers, plastic-coated sensors that are briefly inserted in the fish and turn green when it reaches 140 to 145 degrees, the temperature the Agriculture Department considers safe. The testers are not for cooks who like their tuna rare or their salmon somewhat underdone: both will be thoroughly cooked if you wait for the green. But the testers are fine for cod and striped bass. You can also use them to test chicken breast or pork chops (cut a little slit so the tester slips in), or to signal a medium hamburger.  A package of six is $1.99 at Citarella stores.</p>
