        <p>A New York City police officer and his wife were arrested yesterday and charged with helping to launder more than $1 million in cash for Colombian drug lords, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The officer, Homero Zapata, and his wife, Liliana Lopez-Zapata, picked up duffel bags stuffed with cash, mostly in $20 bills, from drug dealers in the city, according to a complaint released in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The couple then drove the money, in shipments of $100,000 to $300,000, to Miami, where they handed it over to representatives of a Colombian drug ring, according to the complaint.</p>

        <p>A New York City police officer and his wife were arrested yesterday and charged with helping to launder more than $1 million in cash for Colombian drug lords, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The officer, Homero Zapata, and his wife, Liliana Lopez-Zapata, picked up duffel bags stuffed with cash, mostly in $20 bills, from drug dealers in the city, according to a complaint released in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The couple then drove the money, in shipments of $100,000 to $300,000, to Miami, where they handed it over to representatives of a Colombian drug ring, according to the complaint.</p>
        <p>Although the drug ring was not named, Victoria Ovis, the associate special agent in charge of the New York office of the United States Customs Service, said that it was a ''large organization'' and that Mr. Zapata, 36, and his wife, 31, who are both from Colombia, probably earned 2 percent to 4 percent of whatever cash they delivered.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ovis said the scheme had most likely been arranged by Ms. Lopez-Zapata. She said there was no evidence that Mr. Zapata had met the drug dealers while working as a police officer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zapata, an eight-year veteran of the police force, has been suspended from his job at the 43rd Precinct in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zapata was charged in the complaint with making at least six trips from New York to Miami from June 1997 to June 1999, always when he was off duty and often over a weekend. Each time, the court papers said, he rented a car -- frequently at La Guardia Airport -- and flew back to New York, sometimes just in time to go on duty.</p>
        <p>The scheme came to light in September 1997 when investigators of the New York Police Department received a tip and were on hand to watch the Zapatas pick up $100,000 in cash from a drug trafficker, identified in court papers as Fernando Henao. Over the next several months, the court papers said, the investigators observed the couple making numerous other pickups and deliveries.</p>
        <p>In June 1999, the couple was stopped for speeding on Interstate 95 by the police in South Carolina. Officers searched their car and discovered a duffel bag filled with about $200,000 in cash. Mr. Zapata appeared nervous, the complaint said, trembling and stuttering as he spoke. Under questioning, Mr. Zapata said that the money was his own and that he was driving south to visit his mother-in-law, according to the complaint.</p>
        <p>But the couple was not arrested until yesterday morning because, Ms. Ovis said, there was ''a lot more information to be gathered.'' She said the Customs Service began working with the New York City police earlier this year after Mr. Zapata's name turned up in its own investigation of laundered drug money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zapata and Ms. Lopez-Zapata were detained yesterday in lieu of bail. They face a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>
