        <p>MOST takeout spots offer just one chicken salad. Pando's Poultry in the Market at Grand Central Terminal goes them 11 or 12 better.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit, I was drawn to the shop's counter by the display of perfectly mounded heaps of luscious chicken salads in almost every color of the rainbow, reflecting their ingredients: pink for beets, orange for roasted red pepper, yellow for curry, red for ajvar and green for tabbouleh, pesto or guacamole.</p>

        <p>MOST takeout spots offer just one chicken salad. Pando's Poultry in the Market at Grand Central Terminal goes them 11 or 12 better.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit, I was drawn to the shop's counter by the display of perfectly mounded heaps of luscious chicken salads in almost every color of the rainbow, reflecting their ingredients: pink for beets, orange for roasted red pepper, yellow for curry, red for ajvar and green for tabbouleh, pesto or guacamole.</p>
        <p>My eyes locked on to the salad made with ajvar (pronounced EYE-var), an irresistible piquant spread I have grown to appreciate, partly because its flavor comes at a relatively low caloric price.</p>
        <p>In the Balkans, where it originated, ajvar is made with eggplant, tomato and spices. Pando's version combines the sweetness of roasted peppers with the crunch of walnuts and raw green and red peppers, and a hint of cayenne heat. Olive oil, onion, garlic and tomato round out the flavors that suffuse the chicken.</p>
        <p>I tried all the chicken salads at the shop that day, and I can see why the most popular is the curry with walnuts and raisins. I would also be very happy with the guacamole or beet versions. But the ajvar tops my list.</p>
        <p>MARIAN BURROS</p>
        <p>The chicken salads at Pando's Poultry are made at the Ninth Avenue Cheese Market, 615 Ninth Avenue between 43rd and 44th Streets, which owns Pando's and also Kashkaval, 856 Ninth Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets.</p>
        <p>All three stores carry the salads, most of which are $9.99 a pound; some are less.</p>
