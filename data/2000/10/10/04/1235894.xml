        <p>The Museum of American Folk Art has announced an important 20th-century acquisition: a large group of paintings and all the manuscript books of Henry Darger (1892-1973), a Chicago recluse whose imaginary world centered on a tribe of sometimes androgynous child-warriors led by seven angelic sisters called the Vivian Girls.</p>
        <p>Crammed into the single room where he lived for more than 40 years, Darger's work was discovered by his neighbor and landlord, the photographer Nathan Lerner, when Darger died. Since then he has come to be viewed as one of the greatest self-taught artists of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>His work was the subject of a retrospective organized by the Museum of American Folk Art and University of Iowa Museum of Art in 1997. Next month Rizzoli is publishing the first full-length monograph on Darger, written by Michael Bonesteel.</p>
        <p>The museum's acquisition is a combination of gift and purchase negotiated with Kyoko Lerner, Mr. Lerner's widow. It includes 22 paintings, many of them large and double-sided, his often mammoth manuscript books and an extensive archive of hundreds of sketches, photo-enlarged tracings, maps and source material.</p>
        <p>The largest manuscript is a 15,000-page, 12-volume novel, typed in different colored inks on legal-sized paper, that narrates the often gory battles depicted in Darger's paintings. Its lavish title is ''The Story of the Vivian Girls, in what is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion.''</p>
        <p>There is a five-book ''Weather Journal'' that covers 10 years of Chicago meteorology, a 5,000-page, eight-volume autobiography, ''History of My Life,'' a 16-volume, 8,500-page manuscript known as ''Further Adventures in Chicago'' or ''The Vivian Girls in Chicago'' and many shorter untitled manuscripts, among them a book of poems. The acquisition also includes microfilm of all the manuscripts.</p>
        <p>Combined with the four Darger paintings it already owns, the acquisition makes the museum the largest repository of Darger material in the world. (The other contender is the Art Brut Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, which has more than 20 of his paintings but nothing else by Darger.)</p>
        <p>To house it, the Folk Art museum is creating the Henry Darger Study Center in its new building on West 53rd Street, which is being built and is scheduled to open in December 2001. The center will have several of Darger's books on display at all times and will make them and the archive available to students and scholars for the first time.</p>
        <p>Except for the art historian John MacGregor, who spent weeks holed up in Darger's room before it was dismantled, no one has yet read all of Darger's writings or thoroughly studied his practice of packing his scroll-like paintings with images copied and enlarged from comics, magazines and children's books. This is seen by many as a precedent for the postmodern technique of appropriation.</p>
        <p>The Darger center will be under the aegis of its Contemporary Center, which the Folk Art museum formed two years ago to focus on collecting and exhibiting 20th-century self-taught art. The acquisition highlights the museum's growing commitment to this area. The museum was founded as the Museum of Early American Folk Art in 1961, when folk art was still defined as objects made primarily in New England in the late 18th and 19th centuries. It dropped the ''early'' in 1965 and began to exhibit 20th-century work.</p>
        <p>Early in the 1990's the museum reoriented its acquisition and exhibitions programs, responding to a series of stunning discoveries and rediscoveries that redefined the field of 20th-century self-taught art and that still continue.</p>
        <p>In the last 30 years the ranks of great self-taught 20th-century artists have been enlarged not just by Darger's work but also by that of Martin Ramirez (1885-1960), Bill Traylor (1854-1947), A. G. Rizzoli (1893-1981), Morton Bartlett (1909-1991) and James Castle (1900-1977).</p>
