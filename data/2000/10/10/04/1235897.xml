        <p>COMING across fresh chestnuts in a farmers' market is like spotting an opossum in Central Park. By all rights, they shouldn't be anywhere near New York. But there they are, as real as pigeons.</p>
        <p>Every schoolchild learns the sad tale of the American chestnut: how the towering trees that once blanketed the East Coast from Maine to the Florida Panhandle were wiped out by a blight imported from Asia in the early 1900's. For more than 60 years, virtually the only chestnuts to be had in this country were imported from Europe and, more recently, from Asia.</p>
        <p>Now, fresh chestnuts from American-grown trees are starting to turn up at farm stands in small but promising amounts. While they are much smaller than the imports, they are much sweeter.</p>
        <p>A few growers believe they have  native American chestnut trees on their farms, though the only way to tell for sure is by subjecting them to testing by a plant pathologist. But if the American Chestnut Foundation succeeds in breeding blight-resistant trees, native nuts will be much more common -- not next year, but maybe next decade.</p>
        <p>The growers are taking the fresh chestnuts to market, often still in their forbiddingly spiky green husks. On Mondays and Wednesdays at the Union Square Greenmarket, Tim Stark of Eckerton Farms sells out fast, often to chefs like Alex Lee of Restaurant Daniel. He found trees bearing what he takes to be American chestnuts on his land near Hamburg, Pa., and added the yield to his Greenmarket bounty, along with the huge variety of chilies for which he is known.</p>
        <p>Chris Polak, the chef at Blue Ribbon in SoHo, gets chestnuts from his parents, Bill and Carol, who own Valentine Farm in Hyde Park, N.Y. Their 14 trees provide just enough chestnuts to supply him and a few other restaurants and to sell at the Friday farmers' market in Pleasant Valley, N.Y. Mr. Polak says he likes to roast them and serve them whole, to astonish his patrons with the vivid flavor -- and sweetness -- of a fresh American-grown chestnut.</p>
        <p>Many of the chestnuts now surfacing are from trees that are a cross between American and Chinese trees. These hybrids have become popular backyard chestnuts in the last 20 years, and their nuts tend to have most, if not all, of the taste and richness of the American original.</p>
        <p>Fred Hebard, a plant pathologist at the American Chestnut Foundation in Bennington, Vt., said the sweetness of the nut from purebred American trees is directly related to the nut's smaller size. A smaller nut, he said, ''converts its starches to sugar much more rapidly.'' The nuts can even be eaten off the tree without the traditional roasting, he said.</p>
        <p>The European and Chinese varieties of chestnut have been selectively bred over the centuries to increase their size, and flavor has suffered as a result. The true American chestnut has a higher fat content, 10 percent compared with 4 percent in the European variety, which makes it richer.</p>
        <p>American chestnuts have a faint star-burst pattern on the hilum, the tan patch on the shell where the nut attaches to its husk. The native nut is lighter than the occasionally black-striped European chestnut, but darker than the buff-brown Chinese chestnut. The European nut has a more pronounced point; the American is more rounded. Chinese chestnuts have a blockier shape.</p>
        <p>Chinese chestnuts, which are sold primarily on the West Coast, have a slightly starchier texture than the original American. Chinese and Chinese-American hybrid chestnuts are raised more frequently in Michigan, California and Washington, but only on tiny acreage.</p>
        <p>Over the last 15 years, the chestnut foundation has cultivated 8,000 trees on a research farm in Meadowview, Va., near the heart of the tree's former range, with the hope of breeding an American chestnut that is immune to the blight. Since the Chinese chestnut resists the blight, researchers are breeding a hybrid that is one-sixteenth Chinese and the rest American. They anticipate that the resulting tree will have the American chestnut's height (many original chestnuts stood over 100 feet tall) and its sweet, distinctive nuts. They expect no commercial crops, though, until 2015 at the earliest.</p>
        <p>In April, the New York City Parks Department planted eight purebred American chestnut trees in the north woods of Central Park, hoping that a few would reach reproductive age before the blight attacked them. If the trees survive, they will be bred with the foundation's resistant chestnuts when they become available.</p>
        <p>Chestnuts, like apples, are moderately perishable, and should be kept cool and dry to prevent mold. European harvesters often treat their chestnuts with pesticides to prevent chestnut weevils from hatching, but few American producers have the resources to do so. The chestnut weevil was thought to have died out in this country along with the chestnut trees, but in the last decade, it has returned with a vengeance. All native-grown chestnuts should be frozen for 24 hours or parboiled before use and storage to prevent larvae from developing.</p>
        <p>With their meaty texture and sweetness, chestnuts are ideal for hearty soups and stuffings. A simple paste of fresh chestnuts and cream makes a satisfying dessert all on its own, as rich as marzipan and as nutty as halvah.</p>
        <p>At Blue Ribbon, Chris Polak uses his parents' chestnuts in a puree as a sauce for pork, or coarsely chopped in a warm vinaigrette that is drizzled over roasted root vegetables. ''The chestnuts I get now are spectacularly moist, tender and sweet,'' he said. ''They don't at all resemble the roasted chestnuts I remember eating in Central Park'' from a street vendor's cart.</p>
        <p>Chestnuts bought in stores, the Italian imports, are fine for any recipe. Or at least until those hybrids turn up in 15 years or so.</p>
        <p>CHESTNUT CORN BREAD STUFFING  Time: 1 hour 45 minutes</p>
        <p>For the corn bread:  1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal (preferably stone-ground)  1 teaspoon baking powder  1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt  1 egg  1 1/2 cups whole milk  1 tablespoon butter or lard  2 tablespoons clarified butter, warmed</p>
        <p>For the stuffing:  4 1/2 cups corn bread, cut into 1-inch cubes  2 1/2 cups dense white bread, cut into 1-inch cubes  2 cups fresh chestnuts, peeled and coarsely chopped  10 tablespoons butter  2 small onions, chopped  2 12-inch celery ribs, chopped  1 large tart apple, like a Granny Smith, skin on, cored and chopped</p>
        <p>1/3 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  1 tablespoon ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chicken broth  2 eggs, whisked.</p>
        <p>1. To make the corn bread, mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk the egg until it is frothy, and then whisk in the milk. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Heat a 9-inch skillet in the oven with 1 tablespoon of butter or lard. While the skillet is in the oven, mix the warm clarified butter into the dry ingredients, and then add the egg and milk mixture. Whisk until evenly mixed. When the skillet smokes, add the batter all at once and return the skillet to oven to bake for 20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Cool completely.</p>
        <p>2. To make the stuffing, set the oven at 350. Lightly toast all the bread cubes on baking sheets for 5 to 10 minutes. Roast the chopped chestnuts on a baking sheet for 20 minutes. Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the chopped onion and celery, and saute over medium heat, stirring frequently, for 5 to 10 minutes, until the onion is translucent. Add the diced apples and stir, cooking 5 minutes longer. Add the chestnuts and stir for 1 minute. Turn the flame off and add the parsley, nutmeg and black pepper.</p>
        <p>3. In a large bowl, toss the toasted bread cubes with the vegetable mixture. Drizzle the chicken broth over the stuffing and the whisked eggs, and then toss again. At this point, the stuffing can be used to stuff a chicken or turkey. To use it as a side dish, bake it in a shallow 12-inch pan for about 30 minutes, until it is browned on top.  Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>CHESTNUT SOUP  Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons butter  2 shallots, minced  2 bay leaves  2 cups chicken broth  2 1/2 cups whole chestnuts, peeled (see box)  2 12-inch ribs celery, one finely chopped, one left whole</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground aniseed</p>
        <p>1/2 cup heavy cream  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and the bay leaves, and saute until tender. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In a large soup pot, combine the chicken broth with 2 cups of water and the chestnuts, and bring to a boil. Add the shallot and bay leaf mixture and the remaining butter, along with both of the celery ribs, and simmer until the chestnuts are quite soft, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Remove the bay leaves and the whole celery rib from the pot; reserve the celery. Transfer the contents to a food processor or blender, and puree until it is smooth. (Work in batches if necessary.) Return the liquid to the pot. Chop the reserved celery rib, and add it to the soup, along with the aniseed.</p>
        <p>4. Gently reheat soup. Stir in cream to taste, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>ROASTED FALL VEGETABLES WITH WARM CHESTNUT VINAIGRETTE  Adapted from Blue Ribbon  Time: 2 hours</p>
        <p>For the vegetables:  3 turnips  3 beets</p>
        <p>1/2 cup walnut oil  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 butternut squash</p>
        <p>1/2 pound string beans  Fresh chervil for garnish</p>
        <p>For the vinaigrette:</p>
        <p>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/4 cup walnut oil</p>
        <p>1/2 cup peanut oil</p>
        <p>1/3 cup sherry vinegar  1 tablespoon aged balsamic vinegar  Pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper  12 roasted chestnuts, peeled and roughly chopped.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Peel the turnips and beets, and rub with walnut oil. Cut the top portion off the squash, just above the seed cavity, and peel it; then rub it with walnut oil. (Reserve the bottom portion for another use.) Sprinkle all the vegetables with salt and pepper. Wrap the turnips and beets together in foil; wrap the squash in foil separately. Bake the vegetables for 45 minutes, until the turnips and beets are just tender. Remove the beets and turnips; continue baking the squash for 30 minutes longer, until the flesh is just tender.</p>
        <p>2. While the vegetables bake, trim the string beans, and blanch them in boiling water; then drain them, and place them in ice water for a few seconds. Split the beans lengthwise, and set them aside.</p>
        <p>3. Place the turnips, beets, squash and beans in a plastic container, and chill them in the refrigerator until cold.</p>
        <p>4. Cut the chilled turnips, beets and squash into round slices  3/4 inch thick; then let them return to room temperature. Stack alternating slices of turnip, beet and squash in the center of each of 6 serving plates, and arrange beans around each stack.</p>
        <p>5. Combine all the ingredients for the vinaigrette, including the chestnuts, in a medium saucepan. Whisk in 1 tablespoon of water. Heat over low heat until warm. Whisk the vinaigrette well, and then spoon a couple of tablespoons onto each stack of roasted vegetables, making sure some chestnuts end up on top of each. Garnish with chervil.  Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Peeling One Tough Nut</p>
        <p>A NUTCRACKER is no use with chestnuts, but they are fairly easy to peel once they are cooked. Two methods work well, boiling and roasting, but the oven method produces better flavor.</p>
        <p>Before cooking, cut an X into the flat side of each nut with a very sharp paring knife. (Be persistent: they will roll around.)</p>
        <p>Then boil them in water 15 minutes or roast them flat side up 15 to 25 minutes at 350 degrees, until the peels curl back. The cooking time depends on how fresh the nuts are and how much moisture they contain -- older nuts need to cook longer.</p>
        <p>Let the nuts cool, and try peeling a few. Toss stubborn ones back into the boiling water or the oven for some more convincing.</p>
