        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''At Arms Again, Suddenly'' (news analysis, front page, Oct. 3) and other news articles about the fighting between Israel and the Palestinians:</p>
        <p>Your reporters point out that the tragic violence erupted when peace was so close. But if peace were so close, this violence would not have been possible. If the Palestinians had really been willing to settle for any peace deal that could have been signed in the last few weeks, they would not have been stockpiling rocks and bullets or making provocative sermons in their mosques.</p>

        <p>Lasting peace and coexistence, more than an agreement to stop fighting, require an internal commitment. If the Palestinians were so prepared to riot at a moment's notice, then they obviously were not really prepared for peace.</p>
