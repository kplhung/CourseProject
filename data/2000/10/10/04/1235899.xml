        <p>Perhaps it is not surprising that venture capitalists, most of whom are men, mostly shower their riches on men.</p>
        <p>Last year, women entrepreneurs -- who own 9.1 million businesses in the United States, or 40 percent of the total -- got 2.3 percent of the billions doled out by these catalysts of American capitalism, according to a survey by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners.</p>
        <p>That means men got 97.7 percent. Discrimination? Here is the surprising part. Joanna Rees Gallanter does not think so, and she is in a position to know. A newly minted venture capitalist herself, she raised $25 million in one year for her Venture Strategy Group, a San Francisco firm that helps technology start-ups brand and market their identities.</p>
        <p>She raised the money largely from men, and the experience taught her something, she says, about applying common sense to corporate management. Lesson No. 1: Men and women are fundamentally different creatures, and rather than denying that obvious truth, women should study men carefully, imitate their strengths and maybe even exploit their weaknesses. Take male swagger.</p>
        <p>Swagger, Ms. Gallanter says, can pave the way to a successful venture-capital deal, so why not add it to the feminine repertory? ''Women are often not comfortable talking about what they're worth. They'll go in to pitch a project and naturally put a lower value on it than men do,'' she said. ''They ask, 'Am I worthy to go seek resources from people who I know will be primarily men?' I think that's a big issue.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gallanter learned the value of speaking up from her own experience. She was at a meeting where a potential investor spent the entire time talking to one of her male associates. ''He assumed I was the junior person at the table. I sat silently and listened. He finally turned to me and asked 'When did you join the firm?' My response: 'I founded the firm.' This was followed by a long silence.''</p>
        <p>Her advice is to stop asking whether you are worthy and concentrate on getting as much money as you can.</p>
        <p>Another rule of thumb is to accept the fact that venture capital is a male realm and sell your business plan to the poohbahs who rule it in ways they will understand.</p>
        <p>''I've been in a room when a woman will pitch her business, and she'll use the example of two women shopping,'' said Ms. Gallanter, who used to be an independent consultant who helped companies position themselves in the marketplace. ''But you're talking to a bunch of guys, and the more appropriate example would be to say you forgot your anniversary, and you need to buy something quickly on the Internet. You have to absolutely understand your audience, put yourself in their world.''</p>
        <p>Donna Introcaso, founder and chief executive of Intro Inc., which helps fledgling companies develop business plans and find venture capital, said women should not be defensive about their lack of business experience. ''It's like anything else, in that women are not as exposed to it; it's been a man's world,'' said Ms. Introcaso, who previously worked for iVillage.com, a Web site that focuses on women's issues. ''With men, any of them seeking V.C. money have either already been in the game, or have worked for a bank.''</p>
        <p>Her solution? If you cannot beat them, join them. Or rather, have them join you. ''Make sure your group is mixed because oftentimes, a man will want to deal with another man, just as a woman will often want to deal with another woman,'' she said. ''It's really chauvinistic, but it's human nature. Men relate to men.'' She has three men among her staff of seven.</p>
        <p>That does not mean that women have to lean on men to do the hard work for them -- far from it, in the view of Tamara Totah, owner of Dietsmart.com, a Web site she began last year. Ms. Totah, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a former analyst in the internal private-equity group at Goldman, Sachs in New York, raised $1.7 million in financing for her venture in just three weeks, she says, and expects to be profitable by December. Her company employs 24 people.</p>
        <p>Her prescription for getting a bigger portion of the venture capital pie, she says, is to do basic homework, from studying a venture capital firm's Web site to networking. She often attends events where she knows she will meet venture capitalists, she says, and she keeps in touch with bankers and corporate executives -- male and female -- whom she has met over the years.</p>
        <p>''If I hear about Venture Capital X,'' she said, ''I'll pull out a list of people who work there, go through it, and ask around to see if anyone knows any of them. Then I'll call and say I'm a friend of so-and-so, and at the very least, they'll return my calls.''</p>
        <p>Terri Cavanagh, senior vice president of the Women Entrepreneurs Connection at Fleet Bank, recommends attending venture capital fairs geared to women. One such fair is Springboard 2000, where 28 female-owned businesses raised $165 million last January. The next Springboard fair is in November in Boston. Ms. Cavanagh also recommends seeking out female-run venture capital firms, like the Isabella Fund and Capital Across America, which are eager to assist female business owners.</p>
        <p>''It's not that there's a lack of resources for women; there are all kinds,'' Ms. Cavanagh said. ''It's just a matter of finding the connections.''</p>
        <p>Above all, she said, women must believe in what they do and be able to project that confidence. ''Try to act like a leader, that's the bottom line,'' she said. ''We're backing people who can lead. I don't care if you're wearing pants or a dress.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, a big reason the flow of venture capital to female-owned businesses is so slow is that so many of them are low-technology, labor-intensive ventures, like food or craft companies, that are of little interest to deep-pocketed investors angling for big paybacks.</p>
        <p>''Women are often trying to build a certain type of culture, so their business is an expression of their very self,'' said Stephanie Harkness, chief executive of Celebre, a Santa Cruz, Calif., company that is planning to start a Web site this fall. ''They're not in that posture of wanting to grow the company and move on, they want to stay with it.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, she said, she is taking the traditional male view, figuring that if the opportunity arises, she will eventually cash out. ''I didn't go into this business,'' she said, ''thinking I would own it forever.''</p>
