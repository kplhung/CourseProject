        <p>The classic girl groups brought a crucial element into rock 'n' roll: the exuberant sound of women's conversation. In the 1980's the all-woman band the Bangles, whose reunion tour came to Irving Plaza on Monday night, resurrected that hidden dialogue in the new, more open-ended context of underground rock. Even more than the Go-Go's, that era's other hugely famous female group, the Bangles forged a link between women's history in pop and their future, showing how a girl group could take charge and become not just a girl band but a rock band, no gender appellations needed.</p>
        <p>The Bangles could easily update the gossip circles formed by girl groups like the Shangri Las, but they were also skilled enough to revamp garage rock, Byrds-style country psychedelia, and hippie folk. At Irving Plaza the quartet showed the best of its two sides, fleshing out most songs with dynamic harmonies and taking time to rock hard on originals and covers of chestnuts like ''September Gurls'' by Big Star and ''Pushin' Too Hard'' by the Seeds.</p>

        <p>The classic girl groups brought a crucial element into rock 'n' roll: the exuberant sound of women's conversation. In the 1980's the all-woman band the Bangles, whose reunion tour came to Irving Plaza on Monday night, resurrected that hidden dialogue in the new, more open-ended context of underground rock. Even more than the Go-Go's, that era's other hugely famous female group, the Bangles forged a link between women's history in pop and their future, showing how a girl group could take charge and become not just a girl band but a rock band, no gender appellations needed.</p>
        <p>The Bangles could easily update the gossip circles formed by girl groups like the Shangri Las, but they were also skilled enough to revamp garage rock, Byrds-style country psychedelia, and hippie folk. At Irving Plaza the quartet showed the best of its two sides, fleshing out most songs with dynamic harmonies and taking time to rock hard on originals and covers of chestnuts like ''September Gurls'' by Big Star and ''Pushin' Too Hard'' by the Seeds.</p>
        <p>The third element in the Bangles' success surfaced, too, but quietly. The band's greatest commercial success came from ballads sung with heart-rending vulnerability by the guitarist Susanna Hoffs. The line between the sublime and the painfully sentimental was fine in those songs. ''Manic Monday,'' written by Prince, remained fresh, but the smash ''Eternal Flame'' still sounded like wedding-band fodder.</p>
        <p>The reunited members of Bangles are trying to balance their considerable commercial gifts with their talent for more purist, vintage rock. Ms. Hoffs was the last member to sing lead on a new song, preceded by the bassist Michael Steele, the guitarist Vicki Peterson (who reworked ''The Rain Song,'' by her other band, the Continental Drifters) and the drummer Debbie Peterson, her sister. When she finally took her turn, Ms. Hoffs presented a ballad just as plainly sentimental and catchy as ''Eternal Flame.'' It could very well be the group's next huge hit.</p>
        <p>If so, the mature Bangles may be able to handle the fallout better than in 1989, when Ms. Hoffs's ascendancy caused the band's breakup. Now the women were clearly delighted to be playing together, especially when they pulled out the stops on driving numbers like ''In Your Room.''</p>
        <p>And their harmonies, their music's emotional core, were complex and delightful. They even had fun with their other major hit, the ridiculous ''Walk Like an Egyptian,'' treating it as part of an honorable legacy of novelty tunes. It seemed that the Bangles can now see that in their own work, as in pop's history, a little silliness makes room for a lot of magnificence.</p>
