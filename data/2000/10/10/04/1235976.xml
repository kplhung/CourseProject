        <p>A State Supreme Court justice has dismissed a lawsuit that tried to prevent New York University from tearing down a block in Greenwich Village that includes a house where Edgar Allan Poe once lived.</p>
        <p>The school has been planning to demolish the southern half of West Third Street, between Thompson and Sullivan Streets, in Greenwich Village to make way for a law school building.</p>
        <p>Demolition of the block was supposed to begin as early as Aug. 1, but two preservation groups, the Historic Districts Council and the Committee to Save Washington Square, received a temporary restraining order from Justice Robert D. Lippmann of State Supreme Court on July 31, barring the school from making any changes to the property until the matter was considered in court.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 29, Judge Lippmann dismissed the case and lifted the restraining order, saying he had no legal authority to stop the school.</p>
        <p>But in his written decision, which  the school and the preservation groups received late Monday afternoon, he said he hoped the school would try to preserve the Poe house.</p>
        <p>''As a leading academic institution where Poe's cadences are still heard (one hopes), N.Y.U. would seem to be the natural guardian of the Poe House that is so near its classrooms,'' he wrote. ''From a historical, cultural and literary point of view, Poe House should stand. Unfortunately, not even academia will champion its preservation. And without the laws' authorization, nor can this court.''</p>
        <p>John H. Beckman, a spokesman for N.Y.U., said the university was pleased with the ruling, but disagreed with Judge Lippmann's assessment of the property, because he said the house has been remodeled and renovated so many times that even Poe himself would not recognize it today.</p>
        <p>''While we agree that commemorating Edgar Allan Poe is important, and we are committed to finding a way to do it, we do not believe that preserving this structure is the appropriate way to do it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''The Telltale Heart does not beat beneath the floorboards of this building.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he said the university did not plan to begin demolition immediately, and would continue to discuss its plans with preservationists and neighborhood groups. The school is to present designs for its new building at a community board meeting on Oct. 17.</p>
        <p>David Goldfarb, a lawyer for the Historic Districts Council, said both preservation groups were disappointed, and might appeal to a higher court if they were not able to have fruitful discussions with N.Y.U.</p>
