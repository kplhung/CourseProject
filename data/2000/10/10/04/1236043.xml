        <p>Carousel Foods of America, a producer of desserts, says it will buy and renovate a 22,000-square-foot building next to its site in Farmingdale, N.Y., in an expansion expected to add 150 jobs.</p>
        <p>The 35-year-old company, which employs 40 people in making products like puddings and cheesecake for sale under the labels of other food companies, won approval last week of a $550,000 loan from the State Job Development Authority to help finance the $1.5 million expansion.</p>
        <p>Another Long Island company also plans to enlarge, with state aid, in renovated quarters. The company, Vasomedical, a biotechnology concern founded in 1987, said that it would spend $1.2 million to buy and upgrade the 18,000-square-foot building in Westbury that it had been renting for four years, and that it would add two dozen employees to its current 35. The Empire State Development Corporation has agreed to provide a $500,000 loan.</p>
