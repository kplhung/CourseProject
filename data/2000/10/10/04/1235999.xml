        <p>After sparring for months from a safe distance, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.

At times viewers may have felt lost in a blizzard of details, but certain overriding impressions came through.

        <p>There had been talk before the encounter, at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, that Mr. Gore would temper his famously confrontational debating style.

The Texas governor countered not by answering in kind, but by presenting himself as a practical and reform-minded Washington outsider who could solve problems instead of exploiting them.</p>

        <p>After sparring for months from a safe distance, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush confronted each other last night in an intense, sometimes barely polite televised debate over health care, tax cuts, defense spending, campaign finance and other issues at the center of their presidential race. At times viewers may have felt lost in a blizzard of details, but certain overriding impressions came through. Mr. Gore came across as a candidate with ambitious government solutions who looked more confident and knowledgeable on the attack, and Mr. Bush as a Washington outsider who hopes to stir public resistance to what he said was the vice president's partisan, big-government approach.</p>
        <p>There had been talk before the encounter, at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, that Mr. Gore would temper his famously confrontational debating style. But after an initially flat recitation of his health care ideas, the vice president fired volley after volley of attacks on Mr. Bush's proposals, throwing his opponent on the defensive and forcing him to rely on canned attack lines about Mr. Gore's ''fuzzy numbers'' and ''Medi-scare tactics.'' The Texas governor countered not by answering in kind, but by presenting himself as a practical and reform-minded Washington outsider who could solve problems instead of exploiting them.</p>
        <p>On protecting the environment and abortion rights, the vice president also kept up his attacks, while Mr. Bush sought to transcend the policy exchanges by emphasizing his personal leadership abilities. He spoke in a clipped, folksy manner, but whether he overcame what some polls show to be doubts about his abilities may not be clear for a while. In any event, he fell short of making a compelling case for a radical change in policy in Washington despite repeated assertions that the current administration had failed to govern effectively.</p>
        <p>The debate gave viewers a chance to step beyond polls and media analysis and assess the knowledge and presentational skills of the two candidates on their own before making up their minds. The television accounts are sure to repeat selected lively passages, but there were surprisingly few of the usual memorable lines or zingers that the public often remembers from debates. Instead the powerful impression was of two advocates of different views of government. On taxes, for example, they repeated their campaign formulas, with Mr. Bush charging that Mr. Gore's tax cut program awarded its benefits selectively only to the ''right'' Americans willing to take advantage of its narrowly crafted incentives. The vice president hammered tellingly on a favorite theme -- that the governor's tax program awarded more money to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans than it set aside for health, education and defense spending.</p>
        <p>As they toured a range of issues, Mr. Gore seemed most at home and Mr. Bush most tentative on subjects that required deep Washington experience. On foreign policy and the national security responsibilities of the president, Mr. Gore offered more nuanced answers, while Mr. Bush fell back on generalities about principles of decision making. The same pattern prevailed in a discussion of managing international financial crises, while Mr. Bush seemed more sure of his footing on subjects like domestic education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore dodged serious damage on one of his key vulnerabilities. The Republican nominee assailed him for the Democrats' 1996 campaign finance abuses and repeatedly rebuffed the vice president's responses by saying he had no credibility on the issue. But Mr. Gore spoke passionately on behalf of campaign finance reform, declaring that all other legislative initiatives would be hobbled if the system for financing Congressional and presidential campaigns was not cleaned up to eliminate the power of special interests.</p>
        <p>This was a debate free of major gaffes or knockout punches. Both men head to the next two encounters without disabling wounds. The biggest gain for Mr. Bush last night was that he did not crumble under the pressure of the sternest test to date of his presidential potential, even though questions will persist about his depth of knowledge. Mr. Gore displayed his command of issues and his steadiness in the arena, although he sometimes seemed drawn back to the hectoring style that bothers some voters. It was, on substance, a more impressive night for Mr. Gore, but the final scorecard still belongs to the voters.</p>
