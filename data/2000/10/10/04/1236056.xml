        <p>Even before Al Gore and George W. Bush opened their mouths, Kevin Wiland formed an impression of them. He thought Governor Bush looked stiff and formal as he walked onto the stage, ''with broad shoulders and chin up,'' Mr. Wiland said. ''Gore seems a little more relaxed, which is different than they usually are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiland, a 27-year-old high school math teacher from Des Plaines, a Chicago suburb, was watching with an open mind, looking to learn more about the candidates and see how they would handle the debate.</p>
        <p>A registered independent, Mr. Wiland said he had avidly watched the Republican and Democratic conventions and been impressed with both candidates. His politics lean more toward the Democrats, he said, and he voted for Bill Clinton twice. But going into tonight's debate, he considered himself able to be persuaded by either side.</p>
        <p>Stylistically, he quickly seemed to side with Mr. Gore. On the issues, he was less sure.</p>
        <p>From the first question to Mr. Gore about Mr. Bush's fitness to be president, Mr. Wiland said he liked the way the vice president passed up an opportunity to ''slash his opponent,'' adding, ''He was more positive.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Wiland did not like what he called ''those little jabs'' that Mr. Bush was making, his repeated accusation that Mr. Gore was using ''fuzzy numbers'' and his comment that Mr. Gore had not only invented the Internet, but had also invented the calculator.</p>
        <p>''He's playing bully,'' Mr. Wiland said. ''It's just not working with me. It's funny and I'll laugh at it, but it doesn't make you say 'Oh, I want to vote for him.' ''</p>
        <p>But on the substance, Mr. Wiland saw things he liked in both candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiland was impressed with the way Governor Bush handled the question about whether he would overturn the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill, RU-486.</p>
        <p>''I liked his answer a lot,'' Mr. Wiland said. ''He said that a president couldn't overrule it. He's not looking to make radical changes on the issue. I am also against partial-birth abortions,'' as Mr. Bush said he was.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wiland felt Governor Bush dodged the question on whether he would appoint Supreme Court justices who opposed legalized abortion.</p>
        <p>''I think he will put in judges who are pro-life and he was too afraid to say it,'' Mr. Wiland said.</p>
        <p>On the questions about the military, Mr. Wiland liked that Mr. Bush said he would be careful about using the military to intervene in foreign countries.</p>
        <p>''Good,'' Mr. Wiland said, while Mr. Bush was talking. ''I agree with everything he just said.''</p>
        <p>But later he said, ''I'm comfortable with both of them as my commander in chief. They're both going to get top advisers to help them make decisions. Gore was in the military. Bush has got a good vice president and a good father. They're both going to be reluctant to put forces out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiland, who teaches in a public school, is generally against school vouchers, like Mr. Gore, but also takes a more Republican view that the federal government should not take a strong hand in education. In the debate he liked aspects of what both men said.</p>
        <p>And on Social Security, he said, ''they both seemed intelligent in what they were saying and seemed like they had responsible ideas and responsible plans.'' Mr. Wiland liked Mr. Gore's ''Social Security lockbox'' idea and the fact that ''Bush said 'I want the people to be able to make their choices.' '' But he added, ''then I think to myself, what if they make the wrong choices?''</p>
        <p>He thought Mr. Gore's anecdotes about people in the audience were effective. And he thought that Mr. Bush was ''playing on the strongest card he has, which is to take an incumbent party and say you haven't done enough. But I don't know if I buy it.''</p>
