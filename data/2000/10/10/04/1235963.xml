        <p>A cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinians crumbled within hours today when intense rioting and gun battles flared once more throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in Arab towns inside Israel.</p>
        <p>Israeli television reported that Prime Minister Ehud Barak believed that the conflict was waning, and he was scheduled to travel to Paris on Wednesday to meet with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in a bid to end the bloodshed.</p>
        <p>But Israeli commanders said the violence had not yet reached its peak.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as Palestinian shooting continued into the night, countered by fire from Israeli tanks and helicopters, the situation seemed to be deteriorating after this morning's lull briefly interrupted five days of pitched fighting.</p>
        <p>Senior Israeli military officials blamed Palestinian leaders for failing to restrain their own police officers, much less rock-throwing protesters, in what they described as an orchestrated effort to keep the violence alive.</p>
        <p>In turn the Palestinians, who began the day by broadcasting reports of a truce, asserted that the Israelis had provoked the return of street protesters by failing to pull back their armored vehicles and riot officers from key junctions. Combat helicopters and rockets were ''not in the spirit of the agreement,'' an official protested on Voice of Palestine radio this afternoon.</p>
        <p>''It is clear that there is a decision to continue the killings,'' said Muhammad Dahlan, the Palestinian chief of preventive security. ''After failing to secure concessions from us at the peace table, Barak has decided to negotiate with us by bullets.''</p>
        <p>By early evening, three more Palestinians and another Israeli Arab had been killed, and a 57-year-old woman died of injuries sustained last week when the Israeli police stormed the Muslim compound in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The new casualties brought the death toll to at least 54, including 2 Israeli officers, an Israeli civilian, 9 Israeli Arabs and at least 42 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>The rioting began late last week, after the leader of the political opposition and an ardent Israeli nationalist, Ariel Sharon, visited the area around Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem to assert Jewish claims to a holy site whose sovereignty is contested.</p>
        <p>''It was the wrong thing at the wrong time,'' Haim Ramon, the Israeli minister who oversees Jerusalem, said today of Mr. Sharon's visit. ''But it does not explain such large-scale violence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon responded to the accusations of provocation in an interview today with CNN, in which he said the unrest had in fact begun 10 days before his visit to the area of Al Aksa and had been provoked by Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>About the timing of his visit, Mr. Sharon said: ''It was the eve of Rosh Hashana. That was the right time to visit there. Everyone can visit there. Every Jew will visit there. The Temple Mount belongs to the Jewish people. We are the guardians.''</p>
        <p>In their new effort to end the violence, Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat were to meet with Dr. Albright in Paris on Wednesday, and then with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Cairo on Thursday. [Mr. Arafat arrived in Paris early Wednesday for the talks with Dr. Albright, Agence France-Presse reported.]</p>
        <p>Announcing that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders had accepted his invitation, Mr. Mubarak told reporters today that he intended to leave them ''alone in a room, to work things out.''</p>
        <p>Although early last week Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak met in search of a way to break a stalemate in the peace negotiations, they are now far from the luxury of talking peace, forced instead to focus on avoiding war. Each side now accuses the other of resorting to violence in a calculated manner. And each day of continued conflict damps the chances of re-establishing even the fragile relationship that governed previous talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat was severely criticized today by radical Palestinian groups for agreeing to the Paris and Cairo meetings, which the groups described as an effort to quell a long-awaited insurgency that they said should be considered a long-deferred Palestinian war of independence.</p>
        <p>This morning, when quiet still reigned, Ephraim Sneh, the Israeli deputy defense minister, explained the truce agreement this way: ''There is an understanding on the level of high-ranking officers in the field not to shoot at each other.''</p>
        <p>But by late this afternoon, asked about the events of the day, an army spokesman, Yaron Vatikai, said, ''Ah, remember the cease-fire?''</p>
        <p>Shlomo Ben Ami, the acting foreign minister, said the cease-fire had never been as official as advertised on Israeli and Palestinian radio stations this morning. ''I'm not aware of a comprehensive political decision that had been made by Arafat that applies to all his men,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, international observers said, the Israelis did appear to be exercising restraint at some points of conflict. While Palestinians hurled rocks and gasoline bombs at Rachel's Tomb outside Bethlehem, for instance, the Israeli soldiers stayed inside the fortified tomb and in their watchtower.</p>
        <p>For several hours they did not fire anything except a single tear gas canister, which was thrown back at them. Throughout that time, no one was injured, the witnesses said.</p>
        <p>But in Gaza, Israel employed combat helicopters after rioting grew intense in the aftermath of the first Palestinian death of the day, near the Jewish settlement at Netzarim. The Palestinian, a 30-year-old man, was shot dead by Israeli troops, witnesses said, when he tarried in moving out of an apartment building they were evacuating.</p>
        <p>Reports of the death set off a fresh round of battle as Palestinian youths surged to the site, which has been a hot spot. Later in the evening, Palestinians sniped at a bus leaving a Jewish settlement in the Gush Katif block in Gaza, and the Israeli Army responded by firing from a tank at the building that seemed to be the source of the fire, Israel Radio reported.</p>
        <p>Confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli troops elsewhere that at first seemed minor compared with those of previous days also grew in intensity as the death toll mounted. Inside Israel, where the intensity of parallel protests by Israeli Arabs has stunned the police and Jewish Israelis, riots burst out throughout the Galilee region after two funerals that drew tens of thousands. The coffins of the two men, Israeli Arabs killed by the Israeli police, were draped with Palestinian flags and black flags of mourning.</p>
        <p>Jewish Israeli peace advocates say they are calling for a government inquiry into the way that the police have suppressed protests of Arab citizens.</p>
        <p>Writing in the newspaper Maariv, Rifat Turk, a former soccer star who is an Arab Israeli, said he was shocked and pained by the tumult in his hometown, Jaffa, ''the Jaffa of all of us, Jews and Arabs both.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''my heart compels me to say some things that will not be pleasant for some of my Jewish acquaintances: I have a large family in Gaza. We all belong to the Palestinian people, and it is impossible to separate between us. When we see our brothers being killed, we cannot sit by quietly. And when we go out to demonstrate, we cannot be shot at like wild pigs.''</p>
        <p>''Even if you are a person who has spent your whole life trying to act in moderation,'' he concluded, ''you discover at times like this that under your skin, with a power that surprises even you, a great rage resides.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak met with Israeli Arab leaders today in a bid to ease concerns about the neglect of their community, a perception that has fed the rage on the streets this week.</p>
