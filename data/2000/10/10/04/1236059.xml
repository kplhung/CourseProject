        <p>New York Yankees infielder Luis Sojo discusses wearing uniform No 14 for postseason (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Luis Sojo wanted to switch from uniform No. 14 to No. 19 for the postseason because he wore 19 for the Yankees when they won World Series titles in 1996, 1998 and 1999. Luis Polonia, who has 19, understood Sojo's superstitions and told him that he would gladly switch numbers.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees did not grant Sojo's request, so he stayed with 14 for the division series against the Athletics. Sojo did not know exactly why the Yankees refused the numeral change; he did not ask about it when he saw 14 on the back of the gray jersey hanging in his locker today.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I'll be able to change it when we get back to Yankee Stadium,'' Sojo said. ''I heard we're getting new uniforms for those games.''</p>
        <p>When Sojo was told that the Yankees could not change numbers once a series started, he shrugged. Sojo is simply glad that he is not wearing 13. He wore that number when he made it to the major leagues because Venezuelan shortstops Luis Aparicio and Dave Concepcion wore 13. But after Sojo was released by Toronto in 1993, he gave up on that number.</p>
        <p>''I decided not to wear 13 anymore,'' Sojo said. ''Bad luck.''</p>
