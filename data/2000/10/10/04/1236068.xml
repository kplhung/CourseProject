        <p>Season series: Giants won 5 of 8</p>
        <p>METS  94-68, N.L. wild card winner</p>
        <p>vs</p>
        <p>SAN FRANCISCO  97-65, N.L. West champion</p>
        <p>METS</p>
        <p>PITCHING  The Mets' bullpen ranked second in the National League, trailing only the Braves' pen. With John Franco and Armando Benitez waiting for the eighth and ninth, the starters strive to get them the ball. If we can get into the seventh and get it to our bullpen,'' Mike Hampton said, we have a chance to shut a team down.'' As for the starters, only one other team -- St. Louis -- had five pitchers with 11 victories apiece. Al Leiter and Rick Reed will follow Hampton, with Bobby J. Jones or Glendon Rusch being used in relief. Hampton, Leiter and Reed all have distinct styles, an advantage for the Mets.</p>
        <p>OFFENSE  The Mets seem to win games two ways: in close, low-scoring games, or in blowouts. Even in a disappointing September, they scored eight runs in a game eight times. Often, though, the Mets struggle to create rallies. After the All-Star Game break, Derek Bell hit .187 with 16 runs batted in; Todd Zeile hit .224. Mike Piazza batted .222 after Aug. 30, Mike Bordick .184. Will a deep Giants pitching staff stifle a misfiring offense? Robin Ventura and Edgardo Alfonzo finished strongly, and if Piazza joins them, those three could be enough if the Mets' pitchers hold down the Giants. Bobby Valentine has solid veteran left-handed hitters on the bench in Darryl Hamilton, Lenny Harris and, possibly, Matt Franco. But right-handed bench players have a lower profile: Bubba Trammell, Kurt Abbott and the Mets' only backup catcher, Todd Pratt.</p>
        <p>DEFENSE  There may never be a better defensive infield than the one the Mets had in 1999, when the four starters combined to make only 27 errors. The defense was much more porous this year, though still generally solid -- especially second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo (10 errors). Todd Zeile made a smooth transition to first base, playing the position aggressively and quickly learning Valentine's method of playing off the bag to hold runners. Mike Bordick (7 errors since joining Mets in late July) and Robin Ventura (17) are exceptional defenders who had average seasons for them. Center fielder Jay Payton and right fielder Derek Bell cover a lot of ground and routinely make dramatic plays, but left fielder Benny Agbayani is a defensive liability. Catcher Mike Piazza struggled to throw out runners but blocks balls well and holds on in home-plate collisions.</p>
        <p>ON THE BASES  The Mets effectively deploy the hit-and-run, but they are not a fast team and have no stolen-base threats. The leader in steals is the pinch-hitter Lenny Harris, who had 13. Robin Ventura, Todd Zeile and Edgardo Alfonzo are very slow, and Mike Piazza is awkward -- if earnest -- on the bases. Jay Payton is probably the fastest Met but was 5 for 16 in stolen-base attempts; even Timo Perez, the speedy rookie outfielder, attempted only two steals. Perez, the best pinch-running option, is daring on the bases, a philosophy that translates to reckless'' when his risks backfire.</p>
        <p>X-FACTOR  This should be renamed the Melvin Mora Factor, in honor of the obscure rookie utilityman who came up big last October. General Manager Steve Phillips trumpets Timo Perez as this year's Mora, and Perez looks the part. Bobby Valentine believes in Benny Agbayani and has shown loyalty to the veteran Derek Bell. But Perez made things happen when he started down the stretch, and Valentine has always given opportunities to his bench.</p>
        <p>GIANTS</p>
        <p>PITCHING  The Giants' late-inning relief corps has been even nastier than the Mets'. Felix Rodriguez has a 1.73 earned run average since July 4, and closer Robb Nen has not blown a save since July 2. Russ Ortiz, who will start Game 3 at Shea, is 4-0 with a career 3.09 E.R.A. against the Mets, confusing them by throwing sliders in fastball counts and showing no discernible pattern. The left-hander Kirk Rueter goes to the bullpen for this series; the right-hander Miguel del Toro, a September call-up, replaces John Johnstone, who is out with a back injury. Shawn Estes, the Game 2 starter, faced Leiter in 1997 N.L. division series, when Leiter was with Florida; both were knocked out before the fifth inning.</p>
        <p>OFFENSE  After giving up a game-ending homer to Jeff Kent on May 3, the Mets' Turk Wendell said: I just didn't want to get beaten by Bonds. Jeff Kent -- I can live with that.'' Kent has made a lot of pitchers live with losing to him. A consistent producer all year, the former Met has 475 runs batted in since 1997, the most by a second baseman over a four-year period. Ellis Burks, traded to the Giants for Darryl Hamilton in 1998, hit .344 with 24 homers and 96 R.B.I. Barry Bonds set a career high with 49 home runs. Like the Mets, the Giants have power throughout their order. And while Bonds hit just .230 against lefties, the team as a whole improved against left-handed starters, winning six of it's last seven games against them to finish 19-20 over all.</p>
        <p>DEFENSE  The Giants committed only 93 errors this season, the fewest in club history. Against left-handers, though, Dusty Baker sometimes goes with a lesser defensive alignment. He will shift Jeff Kent from second to first and bench the Gold Glover J.T. Snow -- a former switch-hitter who now bats strictly from the left side -- and insert Ramon Martinez at second and Russ Davis at third. Ellis Burks has learned to master the tricky right-field wall at Pac Bell, drawing on his years in Boston, when he learned the quirky angles of Fenway Park's Green Monster. Center fielder Marvin Benard made no errors until the Giants' last road trip, and left fielder Barry Bonds has eight Gold Gloves.</p>
        <p>ON THE BASES  When the Mets played in St. Louis last month, the Cardinals relentlessly -- and successfully -- exploited the throwing problems of Mike Piazza. But facing the Giants makes Piazza's throwing a nonissue: San Francisco has one player with more than 12 steals, Marvin Benard, and stole a total of just 79 bases.</p>
        <p>X-FACTOR  Home-field advantage was a worthy goal for the Giants, who won 54 of their last 73 games at Pac Bell Park, beginning with a four-game sweep of the Mets in May. The Mets, meanwhile, were below .500 (39-42) on the road. It may mean nothing if Hampton and Leiter pitch the way they can. But this has been a special season for Manager Dusty Baker and his team. As Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said, Dusty has them believing, and that's half the battle.''</p>
        <p>BASEBALL: 2000 PLAYOFFS The final matchup of the first round -- the Mets vs. the Giants -- gets under way today in San Francisco's brand-new Pac Bell Park. Both teams are strong at home, both teams have plenty of pitching and both teams have a superstar -- Mike Piazza and Barry Bonds -- in the middle of the lineup. Tyler Kepner analyzes the matchup.</p>
