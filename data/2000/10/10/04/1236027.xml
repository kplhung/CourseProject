        <p>Ramon Hernandez lashed a liner to right field and Paul O'Neill darted to his left, hoping to reach the ball and save Roger Clemens from a delicate situation in the sixth inning. But O'Neill churned and churned and never made it. He finally slowed down as the ball bounced about five feet behind him to deliver the tie-breaking run for the Athletics.</p>
        <p>O'Neill recovered and made a strong relay throw to help the Yankees nail Jeremy Giambi at the plate and keep their deficit at one run, but the play that O'Neill did not make was revealing.</p>
        <p>If O'Neill's right hip had not been plaguing him, he might have been able to take the extra strides to get to the ball. Instead, the play was one of the most pivotal in a 5-3 loss in Game 1 of the division series.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, O'Neill was playing right field with a strained hamstring when Luis Polonia drilled a deep fly ball in Game 5 of the World Series. O'Neill  made an incredible catch that ended the game and secured a 1-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves. Back then and almost every year since, O'Neill and the Yankees have usually made every important play. Tonight, O'Neill and the Yankees did not. Teams change. Results change. The Yankees are slowly finding this out.</p>
        <p>''We're playing a team with a lot of momentum,'' O'Neill said. ''They're playing well at home. We had a chance to do some things and didn't do it.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees used to be the team that always had the momentum. The Yankees used to be the team that took advantage of the opportunities. But, tonight, the Yankees allowed the A's to rally from a 2-0 deficit and allowed them to snap a 3-3 tie on Hernandez's double. Polonia, who had been victimized by O'Neill in 1996, thought this time O'Neill would irritate Hernandez.</p>
        <p>''I thought he was going to get this one, too,'' Polonia said. ''He looked like he had it and then it took off on him.''</p>
        <p>While O'Neill chewed on a burrito in a somber clubhouse, he shook his head as soon as he was asked about his chances to corral Hernandez's laser to right.</p>
        <p>''I didn't come close at all,'' O'Neill said. ''Off the bat, I thought I might have it. Then it took off. It almost hit the wall.''</p>
        <p>With the count 3 and 1, Hernandez said he looked for a fastball, then pounced when Clemens threw a fastball right over the plate. Clemens wondered if the wind had helped to push the ball away from O'Neill; second baseman Luis Sojo credited Hernandez for being strong enough to hit a ball that far the opposite way.</p>
        <p>''I hit it and got it right down the line,'' Hernandez said.</p>
        <p>After losing the first game of a postseason series for the first time since 1996, the Yankees have to win three of the next four games to advance. The A's, who have not beaten Andy Pettitte, the Game 2 starter, since 1996, still have the momentum. When asked if the Yankees must win Wednesday, Bernie Williams said, ''No doubt about it.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill stood by the batting cage before the game taking agonizingly slow swings. He moved his bat through an imaginary strike zone about an inch per second, slowly picking up his right foot in the same methodical manner and trying to perfect his swing. After finishing the season with three hits in his last 29 at-bats, O'Neill was eager to take a swing that mattered.</p>
        <p>That opportunity came quickly. In the first inning, Chuck Knoblauch singled and scooted to second base on an error by Terrance Long. Derek Jeter was then plunked with a pitch. O'Neill batted against Gil Heredia. O'Neill could have made the Yankees feel good before some of the fans at the Network Associates Coliseum had eaten their first hot dog, but he rapped into a double play. Heredia struck out Williams on three pitches to kill New York's first threat.</p>
        <p>O'Neill popped out to shortstop in the third and flied out to right in the fifth, leaving him 4 for 26 in his career against Heredia. Knoblauch reached on Randy Velarde's throwing error with one out in the seventh, but Jeter struck out. The A's brought in former Yankee Jim Mecir to face O'Neill and he got O'Neill to pop out to right field on a changeup.</p>
        <p>When Hernandez singled to right in the fifth, the A's eagerly tested O'Neill's arm by sending Eric Chavez from second. O'Neill's throw was about 12 feet up the third-base line and Chavez avoided Posada's tag to score Oakland's first run. O'Neill gazed in at the plate and might have already been wondering if this would be a different kind of postseason.</p>
        <p>''We're playing a team that's riding a wave,'' O'Neill said, ''and we got to figure out a way to stop them.''</p>
