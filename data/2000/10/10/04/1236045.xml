        <p>The Swiss drug giant Roche Holding refused the demand of a major shareholder that it sell its majority stake in Genentech Inc., the California biotechnology pioneer. The shareholder, Martin Ebner, the Swiss investment manager whose Pharma Vision fund controls 16.2 percent of Roche voting rights, proposed last week that Roche sell its 59 percent of Genentech to clarify Roche's value to investors and provide them with a clear choice between a pharmaceuticals company and a biotechnology concern. Franz B. Humer, above, Roche's chief executive, rejected the idea, telling the Swiss newspaper Neue Zurcher Zeitung in an interview that ''agreeing to Ebner's demand is unthinkable'' given Roche's present strategy of linking biotechnology research with the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses.</p>
