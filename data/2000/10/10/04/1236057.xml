        <p>Mr. Milstein, an anthropologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had opened the doors to his 73-year-old home so that a dozen of his neighbors and friends could gather to eat, chat and watch the season's first presidential debates. ''They're going to skewer each other, so I figured we'd skewer some meat,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>True, there were meatballs and chicken and yellow peppers on skewers. But Mr. Milstein, 32, who, despite his ''traditional democratic'' tendencies had not yet made up his mind, had bigger ambitions. He wanted, he said, to engage his community, to whatever small degree possible, with what he regarded to be a largely scripted campaign. Unlike the rest of the campaign, dominated by one-man news conferences and television advertisements, at least here, he and his neighbors could see the candidates operating without a script. They could all watch it together, spar with each other, laugh.</p>
        <p>''The campaign for president doesn't touch a local neighborhood very well,'' he said. ''It's so mediated by TV. That's what makes it so scripted.''</p>
        <p>That is what Joe Coberly, an information technology specialist with Bell South, was hoping for, too. Still wavering between the two candidates, Mr. Coberly, 44, wanted to see them stand up to the scrutiny of the spontaneous. ''I'm looking for someone who's smart enough to understand, someone who can respond on his feet to a question,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the end though, script prevailed. Vice President Al Gore, for one, seized on the ''lockbox,'' which led Mr. Milstein to wonder aloud, ''What's in the lockbox?''</p>
        <p>How much can the lockbox hold, someone wondered. Who's got the key, anyway?</p>
        <p>And so it went, over sangria and cider. Mostly, they were Democrats and supporters of the vice president. Still, Mr. Gore's speech held a discomfiting surprise or two for Jonathan Marcus, an unequivocal Gore backer, such as when the vice president volunteered his opposition to late-term abortion. ''It seemed like he reached out of discussion a little bit as a grab for the middle,'' he observed. Neither that comment, nor the rest of Mr. Gore's performance tonight weakened his support for the vice president.</p>
        <p>But if there were no George W. Bush enthusiasts here, there were also plenty of people who, like Mr. Milstein, were not sold on Mr. Gore either. ''This is definitely an election of the lesser of two evils,'' Mr. Milstein said.</p>
        <p>''Clinton, he had a vision in a way,'' he added. ''Gore doesn't have that. Bush doesn't have that. In the end, either of them are probably capable. But this is the product of not developing leaders in the last 30 years. So you get these kinds of options.''</p>
        <p>He was still considering a vote for Ralph Nader. ''He doesn't come packaged.''</p>
