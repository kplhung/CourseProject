        <p>John Young, a board member and former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, was named by Lucent Technologies as chairman of its microelectronics business. Mr. Young, 68, led Hewlett-Packard from 1978 to 1992, and was credited with leading the company into selling computers and printers. Lucent, in Murray Hill, N.J., plans to spin off the yet-to-be renamed microelectronics division to shareholders, next year and sell 20 percent of its shares in an initial public offering. The unit makes communications chips and fiber optic components like lasers. The spinoff is part of a broader strategy at Lucent, the world's largest telephone-equipment manufacturer, to focus on potentially faster-growing areas like broadband communications and the mobile Internet.</p>
