        <p>The Giants were stuffed on their first play from scrimmage, and the game at Tennessee went downhill from there. Tiki Barber took a toss and swept to the right, but before he could turn the corner, he was met by a wall of Titans. He tried to dance out of trouble before he was smothered by Jevon Kearse and Samari Rolle and thrown for a 3-yard loss.</p>
        <p>Barber could not have suspected that his next carry would be in the third quarter. Ron Dayne had one carry in the first half, plowing into the line for no gain. With the Giants trailing by 14-0, the once vaunted Thunder and Lightning tandem was done. Over all, Barber gained 2 yards on five carries and Dayne carried three times for minus 1 yard.</p>

        <p>The Giants were stuffed on their first play from scrimmage, and the game at Tennessee went downhill from there. Tiki Barber took a toss and swept to the right, but before he could turn the corner, he was met by a wall of Titans. He tried to dance out of trouble before he was smothered by Jevon Kearse and Samari Rolle and thrown for a 3-yard loss.</p>
        <p>Barber could not have suspected that his next carry would be in the third quarter. Ron Dayne had one carry in the first half, plowing into the line for no gain. With the Giants trailing by 14-0, the once vaunted Thunder and Lightning tandem was done. Over all, Barber gained 2 yards on five carries and Dayne carried three times for minus 1 yard.</p>
        <p>''What's difficult is when the game takes place and all is said and done with, you go, 'My gosh, we only rushed 12 to 14 times,' '' said the offensive coordinator Sean Payton. ''That's not what we want to do. There's been breakdowns in the execution and we'll get those corrected.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Barber and Dayne had little explanation for why the running game that had produced 223 yards in the opening-day victory over the Arizona Cardinals and then 167 and 173 yards in the next two games had evaporated to a 93-yard output in the loss to Washington and just 24 yards on Sunday. Barber remained in the training room receiving treatment throughout the media session and Dayne appeared only in the final minute, with no explanation of what had gone wrong.</p>
        <p>''To tell you the truth, I don't have an explanation for what happened,'' Dayne said.</p>
        <p>Payton said: ''It's difficult when it goes so quickly like that. Offensively, those possessions are so valuable, and so you can't underestimate the importance of the three or four possessions that we had in the first half, of being able to put something together. We had too many three and outs.''</p>
        <p>Dayne's carries went from 23 in the opening game to just 3 on Sunday, while Barber's production has dropped each week, too. Payton acknowledged that there is an ideal number of carries for the running backs, but with a caveat.</p>
        <p>''If you tell me we're going to have 70 snaps in the game, you want Ron to have at least 20 touches, and Tiki to have his 15 or so,'' Payton said. ''We go in with a plan in regards to how many times we want him to have his hands on the football. We go in with a plan on how many times we want Tiki's hands to be on the football, how many opportunities are we going to give Toomer and Hilliard down the field.''</p>
        <p>For the Giants, it was embarrassing to see the running game that had been at the top of the National Football League reduced to a decoy in the 28-14 loss to the Titans. And this after Payton had earned the praise for his play-calling when it resulted in a varied and dangerous attack the first three weeks.</p>
        <p>''When a game like that finishes and you go through the tape, you think, 'My gosh, before we started it was over,' '' he said. ''We've got some guys on our team that we feel can make plays. We've got to get the ball in their hands. At the same time, some of those playmakers have to make plays.''</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel made it clear that it was not the schemes that made the difference when it went well, and it was not the game plan that failed the team on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''We talk about, 'We've got schemes. We've got all this scheme stuff and they don't know what we're going to do and how we're going to do it,' '' Fassel said. ''That's a bunch of hogwash, always has been and always will be in the game of football. It comes down to execution and defeating your man. Then that play looks good. That's what we've got to do. We've got to get the mindset that it's not about the plays, it's about executing the plays.''</p>
        <p>Payton said: ''We're a team that's been able to come out and run the football efficiently. We're going to see teams defensively each week come out and take that away. There haven't been any elaborate schemes. In fact, some of the times it's probably a more simplified form of what they want to do.</p>
        <p>''We've got to continue to know that and attack.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants placed RALPH BROWN, who suffered a lacerated kidney against Chicago earlier this year, on the injured reserve, and they re-signed the rookie linebacker KEVIN LEWIS to the active roster. Lewis was waived last Saturday to make room on the active roster for kicker JARET HOLMES.</p>
