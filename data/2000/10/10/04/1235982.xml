        <p>The Mets do not have to submit their division series roster until Wednesday at 10 a.m., and they plan to go right to the deadline.</p>
        <p>The status of the rookie outfielder Timo Perez is one reason. Perez felt tightness in his right hamstring on Saturday, did not play Sunday and tested the hamstring in a workout today. He ran and completed agility drills, seemingly ensuring his spot on the roster.</p>
        <p>The Mets can carry 9, 10 or 11 pitchers, with 16, 15 or 14 corresponding position players. With both Glendon Rusch and Bobby J. Jones available in relief, it would seem doubtful that the long reliever Pat Mahomes would be needed.</p>
        <p>But Mahomes finished the season with six scoreless innings after struggling for six weeks, and he had an outstanding postseason in 1999. He said he expected to make the roster.</p>
        <p>''It was important that I pitch well after pitching so bad for such a long period of time,'' Mahomes said. ''You don't want to leave that impression in their mind when they make that decision. But I've been here almost two years, and I had one really bad month. I think I've been pretty consistent on the whole.''</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips said Mahomes's strong showing at the end ''didn't change anything for me.'' Phillips said the Mets have decided how many pitchers they will carry, and 10 probably makes the most sense.</p>
        <p>Taking 15 position players would give the Mets the ability to carry four left-handed pinch-hitters (Matt Franco, Darryl Hamilton, Lenny Harris and Perez) and three right-handed ones (Kurt Abbott, Bubba Trammell and Todd Pratt). The utility player Joe McEwing seems unlikely to make the roster.</p>
