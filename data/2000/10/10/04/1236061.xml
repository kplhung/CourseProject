        <p>When Najee Ali converted from the Baptist faith to Islam eight years ago, his family was shocked.</p>
        <p>''But they got used to it after they saw how it was helping me mature,'' Mr. Ali said as he settled in at a restaurant to watch the presidential debate. ''Now, if I vote Republican, that's a whole different story. My family might never get over something like that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ali, who is 36, comes from a long line of Democrats. His grandmother worked on John F. Kennedy's campaign in 1960 and ''walked with Dr. Martin Luther King.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ali also said he was part of what he called ''the new generation of African-Americans.''</p>
        <p>''We're willing to take a look at both sides of the fence,'' he said, ''instead of voting blindly for the Democratic Party.''</p>
        <p>As the debate began tonight, Mr. Ali had not yet decided whether he would follow family tradition and vote for the Democrat, Vice President Al Gore, or break his grandmother's heart and vote for the Republican governor of Texas, George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The debates would be the key, he said, and tonight's was the most important.</p>
        <p>''First impressions are the most lasting.'' Mr. Ali said as he had dinner at Frank's Place in the Crenshaw District west of downtown Los Angeles. ''This debate will be the biggest deciding factor for me. But I'll make my decision not on emotion or tradition, but on who won the debate. Just because Jesse Jackson and the other leaders say vote Democratic, doesn't mean I'm going to jump on the bandwagon.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ali admitted that this ''new generation'' of his could fit into a phone booth or two. The vast majority of people he knows, he said, are voting for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>After the first 15 minutes of tonight's debate, Mr. Ali began to lose his balance on the political fence.</p>
        <p>''Bush doesn't look comfortable at all,'' he said. ''Look, he's the first one to take a drink of water. This reminds me of the Nixon-Kennedy debate. Gore looks like his own man and Bush looks a little lost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ali, who is a neighborhood advocate with a community organization here, concentrating on issues of poverty and criminal justice, said the Republican's conservatism appealed to his Muslim beliefs and the Southern family values of his great-grandmother. But the Democrat's history of social action and support for civil rights mirror his life as ''a community activist.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said, ''it's important that African-Americans become involved in both parties in order to have leverage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ali said he supported Mr. Bush on abortion issues and he felt that Mr. Bush scored points with his ''clear articulation on education issues.''</p>
        <p>But over, Mr. Ali said, Mr. Bush ''struggled'' throughout the night.''</p>
        <p>An hour into the debate, Mr. Ali declared,  ''Gore is killing Bush, from foreign policy to financial matters.''</p>
        <p>''Gore is much smarter,'' Mr. Ali said. ''I walked in on the fence. After the debate, I jumped off.''</p>
