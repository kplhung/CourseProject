        <p>Four of the nine members of Brooklyn's Community School Board 15 have asked Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy to consider firing the district's superintendent and several of his senior deputies following accusations of financial mismanagement and cuts in services at district schools.</p>
        <p>The request comes less than a year after the District 15 board voted unanimously to recommend renewal of the superintendent's three-year contract. In recent weeks, however, the superintendent, Francis J.

        <p>Four of the nine members of Brooklyn's Community School Board 15 have asked Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy to consider firing the district's superintendent and several of his senior deputies following accusations of financial mismanagement and cuts in services at district schools.</p>
        <p>The request comes less than a year after the District 15 board voted unanimously to recommend renewal of the superintendent's three-year contract. In recent weeks, however, the superintendent, Francis J. DeStefano, has come under fire from the Board of Education's financial office for overspending the district's budget by an estimated $1.2 million last year, and from some District 15 parent groups for cutbacks at schools that they say were needed to offset excessive spending at the district office.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeStefano did not return several telephone calls over the last two days.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the city comptroller's office released an audit report which found that the district failed to request competitive bids and greatly exceeded Board of Education spending limits for three staff conferences over the last two years.</p>
        <p>Some board members who support Mr. DeStefano said steps were being taken in the district office to deal with financial problems that have developed over the last year.</p>
        <p>And even some of Mr. DeStefano's detractors say the district, which covers the Red Hook, Park Slope, Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens neighborhoods, has made impressive academic strides since he became superintendent in July 1997.</p>
        <p>But in a letter dated Sept. 29, two of the district's nine board members,  Kevin Allard-Mendelson, the board's vice president, and Margaret Kelley,  asked Mr. Levy to suspend Mr. De Stefano and several of his senior staff members immediately, and ''to consider the viability of the continued employment of these individuals in Community School District 15.''</p>
        <p>Two other board members, Robert Bell, the board treasurer, and Gary Popkin, later added their names to the request in a separate letter to the chancellor.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Levy said he was not available for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allard-Mendelson said he and his three allies on the board became increasingly concerned as information about the district's budget became available last summer.</p>
        <p>''First the superintendent tried to blame it on his business office,'' Mr. Allard-Mendelson said. ''When that didn't hold water, he tried to blame the principals. The question becomes how long and how much money has to be spent inappropriately before we get answers'' about the district's exact financial status.</p>
        <p>Some of the financial issues facing the district were outlined in an Aug. 29 letter to Mr. DeStefano from Beverly Donohue, the Board of Education's chief financial officer. They include the payment of $360,000 in fees to District 2 in Manhattan for leadership training, which Ms. Donohue said Mr. DeStefano had wrongly tried to pay out of summer school accounts; and unpaid bills, including one from Lucent Technologies that had caused the company to threaten to cut off service to the entire Board of Education.</p>
        <p>Mark Peters, the president of the District 15 board, said yesterday that the board had no legal authority to oversee financial issues because of the 1996 changes to school governance laws, which shifted some powers from district boards to the chancellor and district superintendents.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he said, the board was concerned about the issues being raised. He also noted that the board had conducted two public meetings in the last two weeks to ask questions of the superintendent.</p>
        <p>''We have made clear to the superintendent the need for stronger financial controls,'' Mr. Peters said. ''The superintendent has told us that he intends to put such controls into place. Now we need to evaluate them and see how the various agencies with oversight authority evaluate them before we move forward.''</p>
        <p>District records indicate that in response to budget problems, the district took steps this year to reduce the number of employees in several categories, including teachers and paraprofessionals.</p>
        <p>Last year, the district had 41 more teachers than were approved in the budget, and as many as 90 more paraprofessionals.</p>
        <p>But it is those cuts that have apparently enraged parents. Many of them complained at a school board meeting last week about the reductions in staff and budgets at their neighborhood schools.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kelley said schools were not the only places where too many people were being hired; the district office, too, swelled under Mr. DeStefano as he expanded training programs for teachers. But when cuts came this fall, only the schools were affected, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kelley acknowledged that the district's academic performance has improved under Mr. DeStefano. ''He brought an extraordinary educational plan here,'' she said. ''But he has not been as good at managing it.''</p>
