        <p>A government panel that regulates railroads proposed rules today that would end a bias toward approving mergers and would make applicants show that a combined railroad would enhance competition and function smoothly.</p>
        <p>The rule ''represents a major shift in basis from the promerger approach that has guided agency merger decisions for the last 20 years,'' said the Surface Transportation Board in a statement, as the plan was issued for public comment.</p>
        <p>In March, the board imposed a 15-month moratorium on mergers, blocking a proposed merger between Canadian National and Burlington Northern. The board acted largely because the merger of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, in 1996, created havoc for some shippers. Without naming which merger it was referring to, the board said that ''recent consolidations have brought significant transitional service problems that have harmed rail customers.''</p>
        <p>The board said that because so many mergers have already been approved, ''there is no longer the pressing need that the nation's largest railroads once had to consolidate their operations to reduce excess capacity.''</p>
        <p>Railroads applying to merge would have to submit ideas for what the board should do ''if the anticipated public benefits should fail to materialize in a timely manner,'' the board said. And to preserve competition to the extent possible, applicants would have to take steps like pricing route segments separately, so shippers could compare the cost of sending goods along each segment.</p>
        <p>Rail experts said the proposal was not surprising, especially as the number of players dwindled to two big railroads in the East and two in the West. When smaller railroads were merging, even if the process created the threat of disruption, ''the downside was relatively small,'' said George C. Eads, a rail consultant with Charles River Associates. ''Now it's probably appropriate for them to take a pretty hard look.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eads, who worked in the Justice Department's antitrust unit in the 1970's, said any mergers now were more likely to raise competition issues, but that ''what set this thing off was the service concerns.''</p>
        <p>Tom Murray, an analyst in Walnut Creek, Calif., who publishes Rail Stock Watch, said that if the proposed rules had been in effect during the last round of mergers, the railroads could probably have argued that they complied, promising better service with the combined entity. ''The problems in recent rail mergers have been ones of execution, not of design,'' he said in an interview conducted by e-mail.</p>
        <p>The board, he said, was trying to demonstrate that it could protect shippers, to win financing from Congress.</p>
        <p>Donald M. Itzkoff, a former deputy administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, and now a lawyer specializing in rail issues, said, ''certainly the enhanced focus as we have a declining number of carriers is going to be a positive development.''</p>
        <p>The board gave the public until Nov. 17 to comment, and said it would issue final rules by next June. The proposal is available at www.stb.dot.gov.</p>
