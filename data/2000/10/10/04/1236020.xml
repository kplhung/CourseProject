        <p>Both candidates in a critical House race here seem to be running against the Republican Party as well as each other.</p>
        <p>The Democrat, State Assemblyman Mike Honda, does it all the time, with advertisements and fliers attacking ''the Republican leaders in Congress,'' and promising that his first vote will be to make Representative Richard A. Gephardt speaker of the House.</p>
        <p>The Republican candidate, State Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, does it some of the time. He argues that he has not followed the party line in Sacramento on abortion, gun control and the environment, and would not in Washington either.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunneen praised Speaker J. Dennis Hastert at a debate on Sunday in Scotts Valley, but then said,  ''I'll vote for Speaker Hastert, and then I'll stand up to our party leadership and moderate the Republican Party.''</p>
        <p>California's 15th District, in Silicon Valley, which Representative Tom Campbell vacated for a long-shot Republican challenge to Senator Dianne Feinstein, is perhaps the most vulnerable Republican open seat in the country.</p>
        <p>In a state ripe with Democratic opportunities, the 15th has a Democratic registration edge and a well-known candidate in Mr. Honda; it is a seat Democrats count on winning as they try to pick up the seven seats needed to gain control of the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunneen's hopes lie in persuading voters that he is a moderate, that this part of the state needs a Republican voice in the House to go with the Democrats in surrounding districts, and that, at 39, he is in tune with new industries and new politics while Mr. Honda, 59, reflects old ways.</p>
        <p>And as a symbol of his willingness to challenge authority, Mr. Cunneen's most important outside advocate is Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is to return for a second visit later this month.</p>
        <p>No public polling is available, but Democrats say their surveys show Mr. Honda holds a lead of close to 10 percentage points; Republicans are noncommittal but do not contradict them.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Honda can win back the seat that Norman Y. Mineta, now the secretary of commerce, held for two decades, it will be a crucial gain for Democrats in a state where four Republican House seats are considered vulnerable.</p>
        <p>The other three are in Southern California. In the 27th, in the Pasadena-Burbank area, Representative James E. Rogan appears to be an underdog to Adam Schiff, a Democratic state assemblyman. Two other incumbents, Steven T. Kuykendall in the 36th in west Los Angeles County, and Brian P. Bilbray in the 49th in San Diego, are facing a string of challenges and their races seem to be tossups.</p>
        <p>The candidates in the 15th District have very different personalities. Mr. Cunneen, a former aide to Mr. Campbell, rattles off his legislative accomplishments. He is articulate, verging on glib. Mr. Honda speaks slowly, and does not use quick, quotable phrases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunneen promises to ''resist George Bush's temptation to cut taxes too much and Al Gore's temptation to spend the surplus.'' He says he wants ''government out of the boardroom and out of the bedroom.''</p>
        <p>On television, each is willing to bash the other. First, the Honda campaign ran a commercial using tape of a shootout in a bank robbery, while proclaiming Mr. Honda's worries about safety of schoolchildren and arguing that Mr. Cunneen's vote on a concealed-weapons law showed he was soft on guns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunneen responded with his own spot defending his record on guns and saying he had been ''repeatedly endorsed by Sarah Brady'' of the Handgun Control group.</p>
        <p>But as the Honda camp complained, those endorsements were for earlier races. Handgun Control is neutral in this election.</p>
        <p>The attacks have also come face to face. In the Scotts Valley debate, Mr. Cunneen called Mr. Honda a veteran of ''old politics'' with a 100 percent pro-labor voting record. He asserted that Mr. Gephardt was no friend of high-technology industries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Honda emphasized values. He told an Armenian-American group in San Jose on Saturday that he sympathized with their worries about their homeland because he had suffered the injustice of being sent to an internment camp for Japanese-Americans in World War II. He recalled when his family worked as sharecroppers in what was then called Blossom Valley, not Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>In Scotts Valley, Mr. Honda called his 20 years as a teacher and administrator in the San Jose school system a ''great joy.''</p>
        <p>And he said, ''Having been in the Peace Corps, I speak Spanish. Having an Asian face, I look like a lot of other people. And also being born in this country, I am an American citizen. My life history is an American lesson.''</p>
