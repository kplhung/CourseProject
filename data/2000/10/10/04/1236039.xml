        <p>Congress today passed a bill to increase significantly the number of visas for educated foreigners who temporarily fill specialized American jobs, largely in the high-technology industry. Rapid approval by President Clinton appears virtually certain.</p>
        <p>The bill advanced first today in the Senate, on a vote of 96 to 1 that followed weeks of partisan feuding by lawmakers and months of aggressive lobbying by high-tech companies, which say they need many thousands more computer programmers and software engineers.</p>
        <p>Tonight, just hours after it had passed the Senate, the measure was cleared as well by the House, where Republicans set aside their differences on the issue.</p>
        <p>That the legislation was passed by the House on a voice vote and was opposed by only one senator -- Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat who is a longtime job protectionist -- underscored the technology industry's formidable influence  on Capitol Hill. It was just two years ago that the industry first won an increase in the number of these visas for specialized workers, called H-1B visas.</p>
        <p>Under the bill, the Immigration and Naturalization Service would be able to issue 195,000 H-1B visas a year, for each of the next three years, to foreign-born workers with college degrees and special skills, up from the existing limit of 115,000. Each visa is good for six years, although it must be renewed after the first three.</p>
        <p>''The one thing on which I think almost everyone is in agreement is that we face a serious worker shortage with respect to high-tech employment and skilled labor in America today,'' said Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican who co-sponsored the legislation. ''The short-term problem is how to fill the key positions immediately so that we don't lose opportunities to foreign competitors. The long-term problem is to determine what we can do to make certain that in the future we have sufficient trained Americans to fill those jobs.''</p>
        <p>The legislation includes several provisions intended to allay the concerns of organized labor, which has routinely opposed H-1B visas, arguing that they displace American workers and depress pay. Under one provision, for example, an employer that sponsors a foreigner who obtains such a visa must pay that worker the job's prevailing salary.</p>
        <p>The measure also continues a program to train American workers for high-tech jobs and teach children information technology skills. The program is financed by a $500 fee paid by the sponsoring employer for each visa application, a sum that might be increased to $1,000 in coming weeks under separate legislation.</p>
        <p>But the bill's immediate goal is to help high-tech companies recruit employees.</p>
        <p>''There are 300,000 jobs that have yet to be filled,'' said Representative David Dreier, a California Republican who had sponsored a bill similar to the one passed today. ''The industry very much wants to make sure that we remain competitive globally. We either import workers or export jobs and industries.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton has said he supports increasing the number of H-1B visas, and in May proposed raising the annual limit to 200,000. And Congressional Democrats roundly endorsed the legislation today, although in the Senate they had held it up for several weeks as they tried, unsuccessfully, to attach other immigration provisions.</p>
        <p>''I thought we would work together to restore some of America's lost luster on immigration issues, and this did not happen,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who has sought to legalize the immigration status of some Haitians, Central Americans and others who have lived in the United States a long time illegally.</p>
        <p>Each of the two major political parties has tirelessly courted high-tech companies in recent years, hoping to sway the wealthy industry its way. For its part, the industry has found benefit in playing the political game, and begun hiring well-connected lobbyists and stepping up its campaign contributions. According to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics here, the computer industry has made political contributions of more than $22 million since the beginning of 1999, nearly three times the contributions it made in 1995-96, during the last presidential election cycle.</p>
        <p>While the bill that Congress passed today was intended to beef up the high-tech labor pool, other foreign workers who receive the special visas include architects, engineers, university professors and even distinguished fashion models.</p>
        <p>The United States is not the only country that has tried such an approach. Germany adopted a similar measure earlier this year, allowing up to 20,000 computer specialists from non-European countries to apply for visas to bolster the German information technology industry.</p>
        <p>But the American program is far larger: in 1998, Congress increased the annual limit on the special visas to 115,000 from 65,000.</p>
        <p>Still, that number has been quickly exhausted each year. In 2000, the immigration service, having reached the limit, stopped taking applications in March, fully six months before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Nearly 50 percent of the visas go to workers from India, which churns out large numbers of high-technology specialists. The second-highest number go to people born in China. In most cases, the workers are already in the United States, pursuing advanced degrees at American universities.</p>
        <p>''The companies frequently use these people for computer programming jobs and creating new software that can be used in a global environment,'' said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, an industry group. ''When they develop these products, they have to be adapted not just for the U.S. marketplace, but for Asia, Europe and Africa.'' The foreign workers ''know the language, the skills, the marketing that needs to be done to customize that product.''</p>
        <p>The bill, Mr. Miller said, was ''a political compromise,'' inasmuch as the industry would like to lift the limit on H-1B visas altogether.</p>
        <p>''Is 195,000 going to be enough?'' Mr. Miller said. ''I don't know. But 115,000 wasn't nearly enough. The new economy is simply growing much faster than anybody ever projected.''</p>
        <p>Lately the program has come under criticism, with even some supporters admitting mix-ups that leave foreign workers disappointed that the H-1B visas do not lead to indefinite stays in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The H-1B program is a temporary-workers program,'' Mr. Miller said. ''The employers make that very clear up front. Sometimes there is a disconnect. Sometimes workers think it's an automatic step toward permanent immigrant status.''</p>
