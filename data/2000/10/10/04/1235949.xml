        <p>Here in the coal-black heart of Serbia's revolt against Slobodan Milosevic, miners in overalls milled nervously around their idle machinery today, smoking and chatting. There is solidarity, anxiety and contempt for Mr. Milosevic's effort to cling to power.</p>
        <p>The 4,500 workers of the Kolubara coal mines went out on a spontaneous strike on Friday night, demanding that Mr. Milosevic recognize a first-round victory by his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, in the Yugoslav presidential election on Sept. 24.</p>

        <p>Here in the coal-black heart of Serbia's revolt against Slobodan Milosevic, miners in overalls milled nervously around their idle machinery today, smoking and chatting. There is solidarity, anxiety and contempt for Mr. Milosevic's effort to cling to power.</p>
        <p>The 4,500 workers of the Kolubara coal mines went out on a spontaneous strike on Friday night, demanding that Mr. Milosevic recognize a first-round victory by his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, in the Yugoslav presidential election on Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>The strike has persisted and spread to the rest of the coal fields here, and the workers' revolt has become a neuralgic point of resistance for Mr. Milosevic's government, which after all calls itself socialist.</p>
        <p>The mines here produce the coal for perhaps half of Serbia's electricity.</p>
        <p>Before dawn this morning, accompanied by jeeps and troops, Mr. Milosevic's top military commander, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, came to warn the workers to stop their strike for the good of the nation.</p>
        <p>He intermittently yelled and cajoled, threatened punishment and promised a 10 percent raise, but General Pavkovic failed to end the strike, as 1,500 residents of nearby Lazarevac gathered to support the strikers.</p>
        <p>General Pavkovic left behind a conviction among the workers that while the army and the police might seize control of the Kolubara coal mines, they would not be able to mine any coal.</p>
        <p>''No one can make us work,'' Dragan Domazet said today in a pep talk to fellow workers. ''I'm calling on you to stay here no matter what the pressure. The army and police can make us leave if they dare, but they can't force people to go to work for them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica came here Monday evening and was greeted as ''president.'' He has vowed not to take part in a runoff election this Sunday against Mr. Milosevic, contending that the Federal Election Commission had falsified the results to deprive him of an outright victory in the first round. But Mr. Milosevic will go ahead with the vote on Sunday, and the workers here say they are probably safe until afterward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domazet, a member of the city council in Lazarevac, said hopefully that Mr. Milosevic was too clever and too fearful to send in the army or the police before Sunday.</p>
        <p>''If they start something here,'' he said, ''it can explode all over Serbia. Sending Pavkovic was just to scare us. But he brought out the stubborness in us.'' Mr. Domazet using the word inat, which carries a touch of angry, even self-destructive resistance, a sort of cutting off your nose off to spite your face.</p>
        <p>Today there was not a policeman or soldier to be seen. The road from Belgrade was open, with little traffic -- and that despite the opposition's vow to shut down Serbia and blockade main highways, bridges and railways.</p>
        <p>Workers collected in small groups around the huge strip-mining machines and in the alleys between crumbling buildings.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago we made $1,500 a month, and now we make $80,'' said Milorad Stanisic. ''From that luxury we can barely keep our families in food and clothes.''</p>
        <p>''We either stay here four more days or four more years,'' the term of the Yugoslav president, he said. ''It's really a very simple choice.''</p>
        <p>Ranko Radasinovic, an electrical engineer, said everyone here recognized the importance of this strike. ''Everything starts from here,'' he said, ''and here it should be finished. If Milosevic wins there is no future for anyone but to leave the country.''</p>
        <p>Srboljub Nesic, a technician, said: ''This is the only industry that really works in this country. This is the heart of Serbia, and we have to keep our grip on it.''</p>
        <p>The workers say they have taken important parts out of important machines to prevent the authorities from running the mine -- or importing Serbian mine workers from Kosovo to do it.</p>
        <p>''It would take us three days to get working again,'' said one miner. ''It would take them 15 days.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's visit made the workers here feel less lonely, they said. ''It made us sense that we have popular support behind us,'' said Dragan Micandinovic. ''It was important that the people don't feel that we are left on our own here with the police.''</p>
        <p>The democratic opposition has hailed the strike but has been slow to provide substantive support. After Mr. Kostunica's visit, Momcilo Perisic, a former chief of staff of the Yugoslav armed forces who was fired by Mr. Milosevic and is now an opposition leader, came this morning. He had words of encouragement and promises that food and supplies would be delivered to the strikers sometime today -- five days after the strike began.</p>
        <p>Aleksandar Kuzmanovic, a geodesic engineer, said Serbia was weary of Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, and their devotion to a faded communism.</p>
        <p>''Milosevic lost everything -- Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo,'' Mr. Kuzmanovic said. ''He doesn't defend Serbia or Serbs. He's just defending communism here. If he and his wife can't give up communism, let them go to China or Cuba and enjoy communism there. Please let him stop 'defending' us, and let us live in a normal country as a part of Europe.''</p>
        <p>The workers here seem dead set against voting in the runoff on Sunday, backing Mr. Kostunica's boycott call. But they also see no clear way to Mr. Milosevic's departure otherwise, except a conviction that the truth must somehow win out.</p>
        <p>''The basis of this protest is to defend the truth, to simply say the truth,'' Mr. Radasinovic said. ''It's time to try to live in the truth, on television, in the newspapers and in the elections.''</p>
        <p>Dragan Tasijevic is doubtful of the West. ''The Serbian people have shown they're against Milosevic, and still the West keeps the sanctions against us,'' he said angry. ''It's a double morality.''</p>
        <p>He stopped. ''We are suffering the most from him being here,'' Mr. Tasijevic said. ''The West doesn't show us much to believe in, but we have no belief at all in Milosevic.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly, on a loudspeaker, another pep talk began. Despite the government's orders to them to go to work under ''war obligations,'' lawyers in Lazarevac are providing help, Mr. Domazet said. ''We're getting into a more dangerous and serious situation,'' he said, as if it were not obvious to everyone here. The government is likely to send in provocateurs, he said. Don't use alcohol. Stay sober and aware.</p>
        <p>''Everything,'' Mr. Domazet told them, ''depends on our solidarity.''</p>
