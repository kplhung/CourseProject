        <p>If the presidential nominees had radar to find the small percentage of undecided voters, it would lock in on people like Amy Rudolf, a 42-year-old mother of three who turned on tonight's debate waiting to be convinced.</p>
        <p>A diligent voter, Mrs. Rudolf has tuned out most of political campaign until now. She usually votes Republican, in sync with most other voters on this wealthy isle just east of Seattle, but she has been drifting Democratic of late.</p>
        <p>''I am looking for something to convince me,'' she said just minutes before the debate started. ''I'm just not that clear on the differences between the two of them.''</p>
        <p>When it was over, her vote was still in balance, but Vice President Al Gore impressed her more than did Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>''I'm still undecided because my Republican thing is all about fiscal responsibility,'' she said. ''But Gore seemed to understand the issues better than Bush. Bush obviously understands the business person and the wealthy.''</p>
        <p>She thought the debate was civil, devoid of gotchas or zingers, though she was mildly annoyed at Mr. Bush's repeated use of the phrase ''fuzzy math'' to describe Mr. Gore's criticisms.</p>
        <p>''Both of them were doing some fuzzy math,'' she said. ''But Gore was better at articulating what he would do.''</p>
        <p>As president of the Parent Teacher Association of her youngest daughter's elementary school, Mrs. Rudolf said her biggest issue was education. This island is known for its excellent public schools, and voters overwhelmingly support the bond issues to keep schools strong.</p>
        <p>Before the debate, Mrs. Rudolf was unsure if there was anything either candidate could say to help Mercer Island schools. But as they discussed this issue, again, she was more impressed with the vice president.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush talked about the need for  children ''to read and write, add and subtract,'' she said to the screen, ''It's way more complicated than that.''</p>
        <p>By the time the candidates got around to talking about education, all three of the Rudolf children -- Cammie, 13, Frannie, 11, and Emily, 8 -- had left the room, despite a valiant effort to keep up.</p>
        <p>''Gore seems to be way better than Bush on education,'' Mrs. Rudolf said. ''He seems to know his facts. Bush doesn't seem to understand the specifics of the issue.''</p>
        <p>An accountant who is staying home to rear her children, whose husband, Matt Rudolf, helps to run an investment and stock brokerage firm in Seattle, Mrs. Rudolf is well-versed on the tax code. Her response to Mr. Bush's answers on tax cuts was generally positive.</p>
        <p>But she did not favor his call to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.</p>
        <p>It was a school assignment for the Rudolfs' oldest daughter, Cammie, to rate the candidates. Though she did not seem like the kind of girl to echo her mother's sentiment on all things, Cammie agreed with her at the end.</p>
        <p>''Gore won,'' said Cammie, ''because he supported his arguments and he trapped Bush more than Bush trapped him.''</p>
