        <p>Tom Kelly agreed yesterday to a one-year contract extension to return for a 15th season as manager of the Minnesota Twins. Kelly, who has the longest tenure among active major league managers, led the Twins to World Series titles in 1987 and 1991, but has also managed Minnesota through eight straight losing seasons.</p>
        <p>Kelly has a 1,055-1,167 career record, but is 529-709 during the past eight seasons.</p>
        <p>He is without a doubt one of the finest managers in the game today and we are extremely pleased to have him leading our club, the Twins owner, Carl Pohlad, said. (AP)</p>
        <p>BLUE JAYS DEMOTE CORDOVA: Marty Cordova, the American League rookie of the year in 1995, was designated for assignment yesterday by the Toronto Blue Jays. Cordova, who won the award when he played for Minnesota, hit .245 with four home runs and 18 runs batted in with the Blue Jays. The 31year-old outfielder made just one appearance after Aug. 25.
