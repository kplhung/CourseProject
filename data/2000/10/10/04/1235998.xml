        <p>As a mother and librarian at a suburban high school outside Washington, Susan Madden holds few illusions about the sexual innocence of teenagers.

        <p>As a mother and librarian at a suburban high school outside Washington, Susan Madden holds few illusions about the sexual innocence of teenagers. She has overheard girls chattering in the corridors about condoms, shuddered at the scantily dressed stars on music videos and come across students' notes that read like intrepid dispatches from between the sheets.</p>
        <p>''Now, it's everywhere, in your face,'' she said. None too pleased, Ms. Madden, a mother of three, turns to public schools for help. ''There's so much bad information out there, and learning it from their friends is even worse.''</p>
        <p>While clashes over sex education often focus on parents who fear schools have been too permissive in teaching about sexuality, a recent survey suggests that the overwhelming majority of parents want schools to provide more, not less, sex education once children reach their teenage years. And they want discussions to cover a wide array of topics: abstinence, avoiding pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, abortion, even sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>The consensus found in the survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research organization, appeared largely consistent  throughout the country, and cut across socioeconomic groups.</p>
        <p>It also blurred the lines of a polarized debate between advocates of a conservative approach that frames marriage as the only acceptable venue for sexual relations and a more liberal one that says teenagers should receive comprehensive information about sex, delivered without value judgments.</p>
        <p>Instead, parents said schools should borrow from both sides, discussing abstinence, but also advising students about how to use condoms, discuss birth control with a partner and get tested for AIDS.</p>
        <p>''Parents want it all,'' said Steve Rabin, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
        <p>The Kaiser report polled 1,501 sets of parents and students, as well as teachers and principals, from February to May 1999, with a margin of error of three percentage points for parents, teachers and students, and a margin of error of six percentage points for principals.</p>
        <p>The survey uncovered a gap between what parents say they want and what schools deliver. Nearly two-thirds of parents said sex education should last half a semester or more, and 54 percent said boys and girls should be taught in separate classes. The typical class, though, includes boys and girls and consumes just one or two periods of a more general course in health education. Almost all classes teach children about the dangers of contracting AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, along with the basics of reproduction and some discussion of abstinence.</p>
        <p>But most parents want sex education to cover much more. Some 84 percent want sex education to explain how to obtain and use birth control. Even more parents want schools to teach children how to be tested for H.I.V. or AIDS, how to respond to pressure to have sex, discuss birth control with a partner and deal with the emotional consequences of sex. They want schools to tell students what to do if they are raped. Four out of five parents want teachers to discuss abortion with their children, and three out of four want their children to learn about homosexuality and sexual orientation in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Benita Garcia, a 40-year-old homemaker and mother of three in suburban Maryland, said she believed teenagers needed to learn about sex in school. ''They're living a crazy life,'' she said. ''Sometimes they don't listen to what the parents have to say. They think we're antiquated.'' With a 13-year-old daughter, though, she is worried that talking about sex with students too early could ''open their mentality when they're not ready for it.''</p>
        <p>Heather E. Cirmo, a spokeswoman for the Family Research Council, a  conservative research group in Washington, said the report's findings would not change her organization's position favoring abstinence until marriage, with no instructions about obtaining birth control or using condoms to prevent diseases.</p>
        <p>''We believe that the parents who are participating in the study have been duped into believing that comprehensive-based sex education is what's best for their children,'' Ms. Cirmo said. ''If you have a standards-based approach to sex that says abstinence is what we expect from you, teens will live up to that.''</p>
        <p>The Kaiser foundation's findings  confirmed earlier, if less thorough, polls tracking parental attitudes toward sex education. Various polls have found steadily increasing support since the 1970's for teaching about birth control in sex education courses. Now, as the generation that matured during the sexual revolution is watching its own children come of age, support for frank discussions of sexuality with them has become nearly universal. Many parents say the threat of AIDS lends particular urgency to such talks.</p>
        <p>A 1981 survey done by the Gallup Organization, on behalf of the Phi Delta Kappa association of professional educators, showed 70 percent of Americans believed young people should learn about sex in high school. Of them, 84 percent believed high schools should teach about sexually transmitted diseases, a figure that was up to 98 percent of all parents in the Kaiser report. Some 54 percent of those favoring sex education in 1981 believed it should cover abortion, a sentiment now shared by 79 percent of all parents. And 45 percent of those who favored teaching about sex in high schools in 1981 wanted courses to include some discussion of homosexuality. Today, 76 percent of parents want teachers to discuss sexual orientation with their teenagers.</p>
        <p>''Parents want lots of messages, protective messages, coming at their kids,'' said Mary McKay, an associate professor of sociology at the Columbia University School of Social Work. ''And as kids get older, they want it coming from a variety of sources.''</p>
        <p>Ramon C. Cortines, chancellor of the New York City school system from 1993 to 1995, said the survey showed that schools should ''teach what students need to know, not to please the politicians or parents who scream the loudest.'' He added, ''More, not less, sex education should be taught in the classrooms.''</p>
        <p>Educators around the country said they were not surprised by the survey's finding of broad support for ample information surrounding sex, though several described local efforts to expand sex education that had been blocked by parents who view sex education as contributing to a general breakdown in morality. In part, that is because parents who favor more thorough approaches to sex education nevertheless do not consider it a priority.</p>
        <p>''I think the opponents are more vocal and more organized,'' said Arlene Zielke, a consultant to the Illinois Parent Teacher Association, of which she is a past president. ''We're the largest parent organization in the state. Among our membership, we don't get the response back that this is the No. 1 priority, or 2, 3, 4 or 5.''</p>
        <p>Jan Wilkerson, chairwoman of the health concerns committee of the Texas Parent Teacher Association, served on a committee to update the health education curriculum of her state's public schools four years ago. But when it came to sex education, she found it impossible to overcome a well-organized opposition that insisted that only parents should discuss sex with their children.</p>
        <p>''At that time in Texas, we had a 24-year-old grandfather,'' said Ms. Wilkerson, who lives in Diboll, in rural East Texas. ''We had a 29-year-old grandmother in my town. I said, 'These people have families. But do those families have the ability to teach their children? Apparently not.' ''</p>
        <p>A separate national survey released last week, by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which receives some financing from Planned Parenthood, reported that 23 percent of all school districts required schools to teach abstinence until marriage, and to discuss contraception only in the context of its shortcomings.</p>
        <p>The Kaiser report found a disparity, however, between what teachers say they are teaching and what students say they are learning. A third of the teachers surveyed said they taught that ''young people should only have sex when they are married,'' but only 18 percent of the students surveyed described that as the main message of their sex education.</p>
        <p>The survey also suggested that the battle lines drawn by the camps that fight over sex education obscured, rather than described, the views of parents. Among the one-third of all parents who say schools should teach abstinence until marriage, for example, a substantial number also want schools to arm their children in case they do become sexually active, providing information about obtaining and using condoms, birth control and abortion.</p>
        <p>Carol Callaway, a health and physical education teacher at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Va., said that her school district's policy was to teach teenagers to forswear sex until marriage, but that questions from students could take discussions elsewhere. ''We might say until marriage, but what we're really trying to do is delay,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Susan Soule, who teaches health education at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Md., said teenagers from 76 nations and a variety of cultures filled her classroom. Many come from homes where their parents never married.</p>
        <p>She could not insist that sex outside marriage is wrong, she said, adding, ''I'm dealing with a population where marriage might not be the norm for them.'' Her school, more liberal than most, offers an elective course in sex education, and its roster of student organizations includes one devoted to gay pride.</p>
        <p>Ms. Madden, an employee at Montgomery Blair whose children attended the school, said teachers often had more credibility than parents with adolescents, who seemed hardened these days by images of violence and nudity. ''They're not allowed to be kids anymore,'' she said, and shook her head. ''Teens have that invincible attitude, with drinking, driving, and sex, too.''</p>
