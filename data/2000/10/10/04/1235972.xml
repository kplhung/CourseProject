        <p>A chilling Israeli newspaper cartoon today showed rows of grave markers, each bearing the inscription, ''Joseph's Tomb.''</p>
        <p>It was a bitter, double-edged commentary. On the one hand, it referred to the Israeli border policeman who died from gunshot wounds inside the religious site in Nablus on Sunday, whose family name was Yosef, or Joseph. On the other, it suggested that the Jewish shrine of that name, a tiny island of Israeli sovereignty in a Palestinian-ruled area, is a graveyard for the troops who reluctantly serve there and reportedly feel like ''cannon fodder.''</p>
        <p>Joseph's Tomb is one of a handful of flash points in the West Bank and Gaza that have erupted over the last six days. The others are all Jewish settlements, religious sites or army compounds surrounded by Palestinian areas, or the junctures between Israeli and Palestinian-ruled territories.</p>
        <p>Some, like Joseph's Tomb in Nablus or the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in Gaza, are considered temporary, ''bones in the throat'' of the Palestinians, as they say, that would be dismantled in the context of any full peace agreement.</p>
        <p>But at times of conflict, they become points of violent friction. Israeli doves call them ''little Alamos.'' And this week some Israelis, including some senior defense officials,  suggested that Joseph's Tomb, for starters, be shut down, at least temporarily.</p>
        <p>''The Joseph's Tomb compound in Nablus has cost the Israeli army blood every time there has been a violent confrontation with the Palestinians,'' said Maariv, the large daily newspaper, calling for its evacuation.</p>
        <p>Not everyone agrees, though.</p>
        <p>During the intifada, the Palestinian uprising that began in 1987, when Israel still occupied the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip, the territories were one big friction zone. As Israel began transferring land to the Palestinians, the number of friction points was reduced to about a dozen. In addition to Joseph's Tomb, they include Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, the divided city of Hebron, the settlements in the Gaza Strip and the roads and junctions shared by Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
        <p>''What we're trying to do in the peace talks is negotiate the rest of those friction points,'' said Daniel Reisner, a senior army lawyer. ''But inside the army, after the past few days, some people are now reacting emotionally, wanting to hold on to those problematic sites rather than being blackmailed by violence into giving them up.''</p>
        <p>Some historians do not consider Joseph's Tomb to be the true burial site of the Biblical patriarch, but it is still considered holy by many Jews. Until 1974, Jews did not visit because the site was under Arab and Muslim religious control; it is also believed to hold the tomb of a sheik. In the early 1980's, a synagogue and yeshiva were established there, angering Palestinians, who made it a target of rocks and firebombs during the intifada.</p>
        <p>When Israeli troops withdrew from Nablus under a 1995 interim peace accord, the Palestinians  agreed to grant Joseph's Tomb status as a holy site where Jews would be allowed to worship under the protection of Israeli guards.</p>
        <p>But in 1996 six Israeli soldiers and one Palestinian died in a fierce gun battle at the tomb, during the violence that followed Israel's opening of a new exit in an archaeological tunnel alongside the Western Wall of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. After that, the Israelis turned the tomb into a heavily fortified pilgrimage site that resembles an Israeli army outpost.</p>
        <p>This week, the tomb has been one of the hottest points of the conflict.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Maj. Madhet Yosef died of neck wounds inside Joseph's Tomb after remaining there, bleeding, for four hours on Sunday night because the Israeli Army thought that it would be too risky to evacuate him. That has provoked many questions here, partly because it appears to violate a sacred Israeli Army value about not abandoning wounded soldiers and partly because Sergeant Major Yosef was Druse, and not Jewish.</p>
        <p>Israeli army officials said they had not been aware on Sunday night of the severity of Sergeant Major Yosef's injuries. But, given that the tomb was the site of a sustained firefight, they believed that they would have escalated the conflict and caused more casualties on both sides by bringing in tanks to rescue him.</p>
        <p>Like Sergeant Major Yosef, most of the 12 soldiers who are assigned the difficult duty of protecting the Jewish shrine in Palestinian-ruled Nablus are Druse, Arabic-speaking followers of an Islamic sect who, unlike Israeli Arabs, serve in the army. This week, they have been comparing themselves to the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army troops who were left behind to defend sectors of the occupied zone in Lebanon when Israel started pulling its troops out last spring.</p>
        <p>A reserve colonel, Aharon Sabag, said today that because the Israeli Army had ''forsaken'' Sergeant Major Yosef, he would return the medal of honor that he had earned for evacuating soldiers from Beirut 17 years ago. Sergeant Major Yosef's family, contending that he died because of negligence, demanded an inquiry. And many Israelis debated both the army's actions and its presence in Nablus in the first place.</p>
        <p>''The idea of not abandoning wounded in the field is a military tradition and appears explicitly in the army's ethical code,'' Professor Assa Kasher, a philosopher and author of the ethical code, told the newspaper Maariv, arguing that the army needs to explain itself.</p>
        <p>''What we are hearing is that his evacuation was risky, and that is not the core of an acceptable explanation,'' he said, adding that ''the norm whereby the wounded are not abandoned'' should not be undermined lightly.</p>
