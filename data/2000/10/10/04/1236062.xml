        <p>Dr. Jonathan Gallen thought there was so little difference between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in their debate tonight that he said the two candidates were like two identical cans of tuna, with different brand names.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gallen, 45, a political independent and an anesthesiologist who lives in this Boston suburb, saw no clear winner or loser, and he said neither candidate gave him a strong reason to win his vote.</p>
        <p>His wife, Diane Gallen, 44, a lifelong Democrat and former intensive-care unit nurse, also said, ''I don't think there was a winner.'' Ms. Gallen said she would probably  vote for Mr. Gore, and what criticisms she did have of the candidates' performances were mostly reserved for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush attacked Mr. Gore for his fund-raising practices in an effort to question his character, Mrs. Gallen said, ''That's a little hypocritical of him,'' given Mr. Bush's own huge fund-raising operation.</p>
        <p>She also mocked Mr. Bush when he promised that he would protect Social Security, saying, ''Hear me loud and clear.'' Mrs. Gallen said it reminded her of the ''Read my lips, no new taxes,'' pledge by Mr. Bush's father, former President George Bush,</p>
        <p>Likewise, Tom Coveney, a 42-year-old banker who normally voted Republican, did not feel either man changed his mind, though he expressed resentment at Mr. Gore's repeated claims that Mr. Bush was trying to cut the taxes of the richest 1 percent of Americans. ''They're the people who earn the money,'' Mr. Coveney said.</p>
        <p>All three, watching the debate on a large-screen television built into the wall of the Gallens' living room, said the candidates became bogged down in details and sounded like they were reciting canned answers, not providing fresh information or insights into their personalities.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Coveney, Mr. Gore had more facts and was a master ''policy wonk,'' but he also tired of the vice president's constant use of complex policy answers. ''He's like the kid in school you wanted to beat up because he knows all the answers,'' Mr. Coveney said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gallen and his wife were more impressed with Mr. Gore's answers on national security, saying the vice president sounded more like a leader. And Mrs. Gallen was scornful of Mr. Bush's guarded answers about the abortion-inducing drug, mifepristone, and about what judges he would appoint to the Supreme Court. The governor was giving ''a coached answer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''He's just trying to win the women's vote,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gallen was more critical: ''Bush got a black eye on that. Gore beat him up, because he can't tell the truth.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Coveney thought Mr. Bush's answers on abortion were wisely calculated.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't want to be a lightning rod'' of such an emotionally charged issue, Mr. Coveney said.</p>
