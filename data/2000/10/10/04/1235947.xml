        <p>Former government officials disagreed at a Senate hearing today over whether Wen Ho Lee became the subject of an espionage investigation because of his ethnicity, while scientists debated the significance of the nuclear information he downloaded from the computer system at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Robert Vrooman, the former chief of counterintelligence at Los Alamos, said that Dr. Lee, a naturalized citizen who was born in Taiwan, became a suspect because of his ethnicity.</p>
        <p>''It is my opinion that the investigators had a subtle bias that the perpetrator had to be ethnic Chinese,'' Mr. Vrooman told the Senate panel.</p>
        <p>But Notra Trulock, the former chief of intelligence at the Energy Department, denied that Dr. Lee was singled out because of his race, and said he stopped senior Energy Department officials from compiling a database on the ethnicity of American citizens with access to classified nuclear weapons information.</p>
        <p>After an inquiry set off by fears that spies for China had stolen American weapons secrets, Dr. Lee was dismissed from his job at Los Alamos in March 1999 for what officials described as security violations. He was never charged with espionage, and officials later acknowledged that their inquiry had prematurely focused on Dr. Lee.</p>
        <p>But in December 1999, Dr. Lee was arrested and indicted on 59 counts related to evidence that he had mishandled classified material after investigators found that he had downloaded vast amounts of nuclear data from the Los Alamos computer system and then copied it onto computer tapes, some of which are missing. After negotiations with the government, he pleaded guilty to a single count. Prosecutors said they agreed to the plea bargain in order to find out what happened to the tapes.</p>
        <p>At Tuesday's hearing, John Richter, a former scientist at Los Alamos, said the files Dr. Lee downloaded contained details of several sophisticated nuclear weapons. Dr. Richter said the data on the tapes fell into different categories of classification. He added that the data would not pose a major threat to the United States if it was obtained by other nations, because the building of sophisticated weapons would require nuclear material that most other countries did not have.</p>
        <p>''Regarding the data Wen Ho Lee downloaded on the unclassified computer, there are three categories of information: one, computer codes; two, material properties information; and three, problem setups, which include the W-88,'' Dr. Richter said, referring to most advanced American warhead. ''The first are only slightly classified, because they describe physics that date back as far as the 17th century. The source codes I mentioned, they're very slightly classified; the materials properties information, and then the problem setups. The second, the materials properties information, is classified because it contains properties of high atomic number elements like plutonium, etc. The third, the problem setups -- the input decks, as you call them, are truly classified because they contain numerical descriptions of some of our nuclear weapons, including the W-88.''</p>
        <p>Stephen M. Younger, associate laboratory director for nuclear weapons at Los Alamos, said past assertions that much of the information was available in open literature were ''misleading.''</p>
        <p>''I can say,'' Dr. Younger added, ''based on my review of the contents of the tapes made by Dr. Lee, that he did systematically collect a set of nuclear weapons design tools that would enable the possessor to perform sophisticated calculations of nuclear explosives. Further, Dr. Lee's tapes contained the actual designs of a number of nuclear explosives, including some weapons currently in the U.S. arsenal.''</p>
