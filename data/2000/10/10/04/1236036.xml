        <p>Their pregame nerves jingled around the clubhouse like precious coins in a worn pocket. The Athletics realized they had little playoff experience to draw from tonight against the defending champion Yankees, but they quickly turned that energy into a 5-3 victory.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 2-0, the Athletics rallied for three runs in the fifth inning and scored two more with clutch hits. The bottom of the order was decisive against Roger Clemens. The catcher Ramon Hernandez, the No. 9 batter, had a double and a single and drove in two runs. Third baseman Eric Chavez, the No. 7 hitter, had three singles, scored two runs and delivered an eighth-inning run batted in.</p>
        <p>''This was a huge psychological win for us,'' said Chavez, who hit .355 against the Yankees this season. ''A lot of us didn't know how we'd play, being the first time in the postseason, but we did a good job. It was a tough task against Clemens, but we handled it well.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez brought Chavez home with a single in the fifth inning, when the Athletics scratched out three runs against Clemens, who at that point was pitching a one-hitter. Hernandez also had a two-out double down the right-field line off Clemens in the sixth that again scored Chavez.</p>
        <p>''He was throwing a great game, but when I got up, he missed a couple of pitches and I found a couple of holes,'' Hernandez said.</p>
        <p>The Athletics' mood in the post-game clubhouse seemed unburdened of expectations or fear of the Yankees. The starter Gil Heredia -- 6 innings, 7 hits, 2 runs -- said keeping the Yankees from getting more than that was all he wanted to do.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's ever a sigh of relief; when you play the Yankees, you're not relieved until the final out,'' Heredia said. ''But we never second-guessed ourselves. We knew we could play with them and deserved to be here.''</p>
        <p>The former Yankee Randy Velarde, the only player on the Athletics' roster with playoff experience, also knocked in a run with a single in the fifth. The Athletics also scored on a wild pitch by Clemens in the same inning.</p>
        <p>''It was the playoffs, the world champions, the Rocket on the hill; yeah, we were nervous,'' Jason Giambi said. ''But we settled down and did the things we needed to do to win.''</p>
