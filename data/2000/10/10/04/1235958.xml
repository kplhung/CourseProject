        <p>Keeping Score, But Which Game?</p>
        <p>So what's a top politician  who is perhaps New York City's best-known baseball fanatic to do -- watch the Yankees in the opening game of the American League division series or the first presidential debate?</p>
        <p>It was not a tough pick for MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI last night. The game between the Yankees and the Oakland Athletics easily beat the Bush-Gore face-off, the mayor said.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to tape the debate,'' Mr. Giuliani said during an appearance at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx yesterday afternoon. Try that with the ballgame, he said, and ''somebody will tell me the score.''</p>
        <p>As far as any possible interruptions from the unpredictable and sometimes unruly metropolis that he runs, there was no need to worry. He took care of that. ''I've blocked my schedule out from about 7:45 p.m.,'' he said, guaranteeing that there would be ''no emergencies of any kind.''</p>
        <p>The mayor was so excited about last night's ballgame in Oakland that he even daydreamed a bit about making a quick dash for the West Coast.</p>
        <p>''If I weren't mayor of New York City and I was in perfect health, I would get on an airplane right now and head to Oakland,'' Mr. Giuliani said, alluding to his continuing treatment for prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>Of course, there was the usual round of betting. Calls had been put in to the mayors of both San Francisco and Oakland, and negotiations continued through the day to settle on appropriate terms.</p>
        <p>Adding Color  Under the Food</p>
        <p>GABRIEL KREUTHER went to work yesterday and was startled. ''It looked very much like a store in there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kreuther is the chef at Jean-Georges, the modernistic restaurant at One Columbus Circle where the color scheme is coolly neutral -- beiges and grays. But yesterday, MARTHA STEWART had taken over, transforming the restaurant the way those Folger's coffee commercials transform restaurants, except that what was replaced yesterday was not the food but the pots and pans that were used to cook it and the utensils that were used to serve and eat it.</p>
        <p>The replacements were all from the Martha Stewart Everyday kitchen products that will be sold at Kmart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kreuther liked the skillet he used for the scrambled eggs.</p>
        <p>''In the dining room, nobody knows the difference,'' he said. ''I'm ready to buy one. It's for a household, not for professionals. For what it is, it's much cheaper than some big brand name.''</p>
        <p>No Chopsticks  For These Stars</p>
        <p>Let's say that your latest movie played at the New York Film Festival on Sunday, and that you are staying at the Mercer Hotel in SoHo, and that on Monday you slipped your size 0 body into Agnes B and Marc Jacobs for a photo shoot for Harper's Bazaar magazine. It's now Monday night. Where do you eat?</p>
        <p>For MAGGIE CHEUNG, the star of Wong Kar-wai's ''In the Mood for Love,'' the answer is not some broth-and-seaweed place. It is an old favorite, Peter Luger's steakhouse in Brooklyn. Not only did Ms. Cheung -- who has been cast for ''Memoirs of a Geisha'' (''if it ever gets made,'' she said) -- make the reservation a week in advance from Hong Kong, but she took along her co-star, TONY LEUNG CHIU WAI, who won the Cannes Film Festival's best-actor award for his role in ''In the Mood for Love.'' Here is what they told the waiter: tomatoes, onions, creamed spinach (''of course,'' he said) and two huge steaks, along with a $190 bottle of Opus One red wine. ''So we don't get too crabby doing publicity the next day,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Here is what they told each other: The question-and-answer session on Sunday night at the film festival left something to be desired. ''Two-thirds of the people left,'' Ms. Cheung said. ''And the people who stayed were not that intelligent.''</p>
        <p>Later, the talk turned to food. She asked Mr. Leung to compare a Peter Luger steak and Kobe beef. ''Kobe beef is too rich,'' he said. ''You can't eat too much of it.''</p>
        <p>She agreed.</p>
        <p>''Kobe beef is fat and too soft,'' she said. ''This steak is real beef. You have to attack it. This is what steak should be.''</p>
