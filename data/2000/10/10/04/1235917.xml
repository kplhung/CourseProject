        <p>''There's no question as to the existence of discrimination,'' Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo said in announcing the takeover of the Beaumont Housing Authority in East Texas.

        <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development seized control of a public housing authority in Texas today, saying the agency had demonstrated a pattern of discriminatory abuses dating to the 1960's.</p>
        <p>''There's no question as to the existence of discrimination,'' Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo said in announcing the takeover of the Beaumont Housing Authority in East Texas. ''There's no question that it's been going on for decades. The only question is, When do you say, 'Enough is enough?' ''</p>
        <p>HUD officials said the Beaumont housing agency sold public housing units to ineligible buyers, failed to use public housing funds to benefit low-income families and kept inadequate records on the administration of their programs and compliance with civil rights laws.</p>
        <p>But John Goodyear, who resigned last month as chairman of the housing authority under pressure from HUD, denied the accusations today and blamed federal officials and the management practices of a former director, who departed in April.</p>
        <p>''Everything we ever did was approved by our local HUD officials,'' Mr. Goodyear said. ''They sat in on all of our executive committee meetings.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodyear said he had asked for an inspector general's investigation into the case and would meet with investigators in coming weeks.</p>
        <p>''This is the worst case of federal abuse of power I've ever seen,'' he said. ''Most of the problems we've had, and any delays in building projects, were caused by either the courts or the bureaucrats at HUD. We're being hung without a trial, with HUD as the judge, jury and hangman.''</p>
        <p>In 1992, HUD officials said, the Beaumont authority received $10.6 million for 150 public housing units to provide desegregated housing. Only 100 units have been built, they said, and many of those have not been made available to minority tenants.</p>
        <p>Despite those failings, Mr. Cuomo said, the Beaumont Housing Authority financed a separate moderate- to high-income development called Lexington on the Lake, largely for nonminority residents. It also improperly sold off other public housing to avoid having to integrate it, he said.</p>
        <p>''This is a straightforward situation in that it's egregious, and it's been going on since the 1960's,'' Mr. Cuomo said, citing court decrees in 1980 and 1985 that had ordered the Beaumont agency to desegregate its public housing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodyear denied that race played any role in the agency's activities, and said that HUD demands to build 100 units on a single site in Beaumont rather than scattering smaller projects around the city were to blame for delays.</p>
        <p>''We just couldn't find an appropriate site,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Ninety-seven percent of our housing authority's residents are minorities. Sixty percent of our staff is minority. HUD wanted us to do things that we thought were improper, and we wouldn't do it, and that's what this is all about,'' Mr. Goodyear said.</p>
        <p>A federal court in Texas issued an order authorizing the takeover on Sept. 28. HUD officials said administration of the Beaumont agency would be handed over to the neighboring Port Arthur Housing Authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo said he had tried to negotiate a compromise with the authority's leaders to ensure implementation of nondiscriminatory policies.</p>
        <p>''When they haven't done it in 20 years, they are probably not going to start now,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''We really had no choice in the matter.''</p>
        <p>Only after repeated efforts to bring the agency into compliance with HUD integration policies had failed, he said, was the decision made to take over the agency.</p>
        <p>Leland Jones, a spokesman for HUD, said: ''Deadlines would come and go, and nothing would happen. It became clear to us that they weren't going to do anything, so we were obligated to step in to enforce civil rights laws.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones said the agency had not submitted a financial audit to HUD in three years.</p>
        <p>''It appears that they illegally or inappropriately sold some of their projects, among other irregularities we've found. There's also been a complete lack of good faith on segregation issues,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodyear said that if any of the sales were improper, HUD officials should have made that known to local housing authorities at the time.</p>
        <p>''Those transactions took place five years ago, local HUD officials knew all about them, and they never complained until now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodyear acknowledged that there had been delays caused by outside accountants in producing audited records, but he said, ''The records were all delivered to them last week and they're just fine. No problems with any of them.''</p>
        <p>This is eighth time since President Clinton took office that the agency has seized control of a local housing authority, Mr. Jones said, describing the action as ''rare,'' given that HUD oversees nearly 2,800 such entities nationwide.</p>
        <p>HUD has previously taken over housing authorities in San Francisco; Wellston, Mo.; Lafayette, La; New Orleans; Chicago; Camden, N.J.; and Orange County, Tex., he said.</p>
