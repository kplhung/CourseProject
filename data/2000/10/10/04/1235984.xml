        <p>Signaling that fiscal management is a top priority, the new archbishop of New York, Edward M. Egan, has hired a longtime former aide who helped overhaul the finances of his former diocese.</p>
        <p>Bernard E. Reidy, a layman who was the chief financial officer of the Diocese of Bridgeport for the last 15 years, will begin work in the Archdiocese of New York on Monday, holding the newly created title of delegate for finance and administration. He will report directly to the archbishop.</p>
        <p>In the 12 years that Archbishop Egan led the Roman Catholic Church in Bridgeport, Mr. Reidy helped him erase mounds of debt, consolidate the diocesan school system to cut costs and carry out a hugely ambitious fund-raising campaign, colleagues said.</p>
        <p>''Archbishop Egan and Bernie Reidy are a good team,'' said Joseph J. McAleer, the Bridgeport diocese's communications director. He described Mr. Reidy as ''a genius at fund-raising and at assisting parishes and schools with financial matters.''</p>
        <p>In making Mr. Reidy his first addition to the hierarchy of the archdiocese, Archbishop Egan seemed to be seeking out not only the support of a trusted adviser but the experience of a veteran church manager familiar with the tough decisions often needed to impose fiscal order. The archdiocese annually spends more than $527 million.</p>
        <p>The New York Archdiocese, particularly in its school system, faces  some of the same challenges that Bishop Egan encountered when he arrived in Bridgeport in 1988. His predecessor in New York, Cardinal John J. O'Connor, struggled to avoid shutting schools, but many church watchers predicted his successor would be forced to take that action.</p>
        <p>A number of parishes in New York have had to dig into reserve funds to finance schools that are operating despite persistent losses. At the same time, a number of growing communities in New York's northern suburbs are in need of new or larger church buildings and schools.</p>
        <p>In Bridgeport, Bishop Egan closed or or consolidated parishes and schools with dwindling populations of immigrant Lithuanians, Slovaks, Poles and Italians, who had once been the mainstays of the local churches. Some parishioners who opposed the changes said he cared more about the bottom line than about people.</p>
        <p>After he was selected by Pope John Paul II to succeed Cardinal O'Connor upon the cardinal's death, Archbishop Egan said he would refrain from making any immediate changes and would spend the summer learning about the archdiocese, which sprawls across 10 counties and is home to some 2.4 million Catholics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reidy said in an interview that he expected to work closely with Archbishop Egan.</p>
        <p>''The challenge is to work with the archbishop on a daily basis, looking at the overall administrative structure of the archdiocese.'' Mr. Reidy said from Washington, where he was attending the annual Diocesan Fiscal Management Conference, a gathering of church finance officials. ''I am hoping that as time goes on we can take a good program and make it a greater program.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said today that Mr. Reidy's role and responsibilities in New York had yet to be defined. Archbishop Egan is away on an annual retreat until later this week, Mr. Zwilling said, and has not commented publicly on the appointment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zwilling said that other top managers of the archdiocese, including the chancellor, Msgr. Edward D. O'Donnell; the vice chancellor, William Daly; and the chief fiscal officer, Robert Goldschmidt, are expected to remain in place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reidy's appointment seemed to reflect the archbishop's interest in business affairs. In Bridgeport, Bishop Egan was involved in virtually every aspect of management, from reviewing architectural plans for new buildings to reworking the pension plan for church employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zwilling cautioned against seeing Mr. Reidy's appointment as part of any larger design. ''I wouldn't make this into a statement beyond anything other than what it is: somebody the archbishop has brought in to assist him with administration and finance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reidy worked for the Bridgeport diocese since 1969, first as its business manager and later as the chief fiscal officer and director of administration. He graduated from Western Connecticut State University and received an M.B.A. in accounting and finance from the University of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>A native of Darien, Mr. Reidy, 58, lives in Newtown, where he is active in local politics as a member of the Legislative Council and serves on numerous boards and committees. He is also a registered broker in securities, life insurance and real estate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reidy consolidated the school system and regionalized its finances so that costs were shared across the diocese. He also worked with Bishop Egan to begin a five-year capital campaign in 1995 called Faith in the Future, with a goal of raising $30 million. By this year, the campaign had received pledges of more than $43 million and had collected more than $28 million.</p>
