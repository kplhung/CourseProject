        <p>In a move that rattled Taiwan's already shaky government, Prime Minister Tang Fei resigned on Tuesday, citing poor health. Mr. Tang, who was in the post for less than five months, announced his decision after meeting President Chen Shui-bian.</p>
        <p>''In the last three or four weeks, every time I met the president, I told him my health was failing,'' said Mr. Tang, 68, who had surgery in the spring. ''This time, the president accepted my resignation request.''</p>

        <p>In a move that rattled Taiwan's already shaky government, Prime Minister Tang Fei resigned on Tuesday, citing poor health. Mr. Tang, who was in the post for less than five months, announced his decision after meeting President Chen Shui-bian.</p>
        <p>''In the last three or four weeks, every time I met the president, I told him my health was failing,'' said Mr. Tang, 68, who had surgery in the spring. ''This time, the president accepted my resignation request.''</p>
        <p>President Chen quickly selected Mr. Tang's deputy, Chang Chun-hsiung, to succeed him. Mr. Chang, 62, is a longtime member of Mr. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party.</p>
        <p>His appointment today may increase tension between Mr. Chen and the Nationalist Party, whom he swept out of power in March.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen had chosen Mr. Tang, a former fighter pilot and member of the Nationalists, to act as a bridge to the former governing party.</p>
        <p>But the Nationalists, who still control the Legislature, have stymied Mr. Chen at every turn. And Mr. Tang made enemies among senior officials of Mr. Chen's party.</p>
        <p>Most recently, he clashed with Mr. Chen's party over whether to complete construction of $5.4 billion nuclear power plant, a project that is one-third complete. Mr. Tang favored continuing work. The party wants to halt it. With a decision due this month, his relations with the party had reached a breaking point.</p>
        <p>''This symbolizes that Chen Shui-bian cannot hold together a coalition government,'' said the secretary general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, Andrew Yang. ''He will now be under tremendous pressure.''</p>
        <p>The resignation could also upset the delicate balance between Taiwan and China. Mr. Tang's appointment was widely regarded as a soothing gesture toward China because of his ties to the Nationalists. Mr. Tang, who was born in mainland China, had been defense minister under Mr. Chen's predecessor, Lee Teng-hui.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen, on the other hand, was born in Taiwan, and his party had long favored independence, though he has said he would not declare it as president.</p>
        <p>''One reason China decided to wait and see was that Chen was going to form a coalition government,'' Mr. Yang said. ''Now Chen's party is going to control the entire cabinet, which is not good from Beijing's point of view.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen's efforts to forge a consensus have been tortured from the start. The president won with 39 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>As shrewd as it was, Mr. Chen's appointment of Mr. Tang was criticized by both his supporters and members of the Nationalist Party. Mr. Tang was reluctant to take the job because of his fragile health.</p>
        <p>The prime minister's efforts to form a government were also overshadowed by events that, while beyond his control, were frequently blamed on him. The most serious was a flash flood in central Taiwan last summer that killed four construction workers. While the workers clung desperately to one another, the military and the police bickered over who should respond.</p>
        <p>The debate over the nuclear plant brought the discontent with Mr. Tang into the open. Mr. Tang and the Nationalists contend that the project is crucial to Taiwan's economic health. But on Saturday, the Economics Ministry recommended not continuing the work. And early today, the economics minister, Lin Hsin-i, also said he would resign, Reuters reported from Taipei.</p>
