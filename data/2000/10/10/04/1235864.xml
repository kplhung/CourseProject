        <p>I'm a part-time model, and one of my first jobs was to be a secretary behind a desk, phone in hand. Another time, I played a secretary on the stage in a repertory theater. So, when my son asked me to fill in for his legal secretary while she was on sick leave, I thought, ''This will be a piece of cake.'' How wrong I was. Keeping one toe on your Dictaphone machine and answering the phone while drafting a divorce complaint is the kind of gymnastic activity that takes practice. Even so, eight years later, I am still at it.</p>
        <p>Also, you have to be quick on your feet when dealing with clients. One young woman, desperate for financial support from the father of her child, asked what our fees were. After I told her, she shouted, ''What? Why, I could have him killed for half that much.'' I thought she had a point, but stopped short of saying so. I am not supposed to turn business away.</p>

        <p>I'm a part-time model, and one of my first jobs was to be a secretary behind a desk, phone in hand. Another time, I played a secretary on the stage in a repertory theater. So, when my son asked me to fill in for his legal secretary while she was on sick leave, I thought, ''This will be a piece of cake.'' How wrong I was. Keeping one toe on your Dictaphone machine and answering the phone while drafting a divorce complaint is the kind of gymnastic activity that takes practice. Even so, eight years later, I am still at it.</p>
        <p>Also, you have to be quick on your feet when dealing with clients. One young woman, desperate for financial support from the father of her child, asked what our fees were. After I told her, she shouted, ''What? Why, I could have him killed for half that much.'' I thought she had a point, but stopped short of saying so. I am not supposed to turn business away.</p>
        <p>We work in a suite of law offices, where each attorney has his own practice. Some of the secretaries seem to spend most of their time gabbing with friends on the phone or taking cigarette breaks. But they aren't just secretaries; they are legal secretaries, and they have acquired so much expertise over the years, they are too valuable to let go. Even if they got down on their knees and begged, their bosses wouldn't fire them. I tried, and I'm still here.</p>
        <p>We are the only ones who know where miscellaneous things are filed and what the real names of other attorneys are. When my boss dictates a letter to ''Skip,'' I address it to Jerome. ''Bo'' is really Robert, and ''Trey'' is the fellow with III after his name.</p>
        <p>Our employers rely on us, but whom do we rely on? In great part, one another. There is nothing more comforting than five other shoulders to lean on. Once, I tried to delete an out-of-date letter and accidentally deleted 100 other letters along with it. My shriek brought everyone running. It took one loyal compatriot an hour to find and restore most of the missing files. My gratitude will last until the next millennium.</p>
        <p>Humor goes a long way in making the job fun. On Secretaries Day, one of my colleagues told me how much she liked the flowers on my desk. ''Did you buy them yourself?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''No, my boss did.''</p>
        <p>''Bitch!'' she replied. I died laughing.</p>
        <p>Another time, this secretary's boss gave her a companionable hug. ''This instead of medical benefits?'' she quipped.</p>
        <p>Life is made up of goals, detours, short cuts and end-runs. What we originally decided to do is not always what we are currently doing.</p>
        <p>But sometimes, what life has chosen for us can be the most rewarding occupation of all. You spend a good part of your life in an area which you hope gives you the satisfaction of using talent and intuition to assist in the problem-solving of some of the more crucial aspects of life. That can be intoxicating. When your employer returns from court and shouts, ''Not guilty,'' the cheerleader in the attorney's support staff does cartwheels, and that moment is charged with sheer joy.</p>
