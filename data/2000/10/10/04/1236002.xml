        <p>A federal study has ranked New Jersey 48th in the country in terms of meeting standards for treatment of Medicare patients.</p>
        <p>The study, conducted by the Federal Health Care Financing Administration and published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at whether 22 widely accepted procedures and medications were administered to Medicare patients, mainly the elderly and people with physical and mental disabilities, who suffered from six specific illnesses. The illnesses were heart attack, heart failure, stroke, pneumonia, breast cancer and diabetes, with data dating back to 1997.</p>

        <p>A federal study has ranked New Jersey 48th in the country in terms of meeting standards for treatment of Medicare patients.</p>
        <p>The study, conducted by the Federal Health Care Financing Administration and published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at whether 22 widely accepted procedures and medications were administered to Medicare patients, mainly the elderly and people with physical and mental disabilities, who suffered from six specific illnesses. The illnesses were heart attack, heart failure, stroke, pneumonia, breast cancer and diabetes, with data dating back to 1997.</p>
        <p>Researchers recorded, for example, whether doctors gave stroke victims a drug known as sublingual nifedipine, which can lower high blood pressure but can itself cause strokes.</p>
        <p>The federal government spent $6.7 billion on Medicare reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers in New Jersey in 1998, for care of slightly more than 1 million beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Northeastern states tended to rank high in the study: New Hampshire and Vermont ranked first and second. But the study also found that sparsely populated states generally faired well, and New Jersey is the most densely populated state. Connecticut ranked 6th; New York was  31st.</p>
        <p>In response to the study, representatives of the New Jersey medical establishment held a news conference yesterday at the State House in Trenton, where they made no effort to dispute the conclusions, but played down the significance of the state's ranking, which was ahead of only Mississippi (49), Louisiana (50), Arkansas (51) and Puerto Rico (52).</p>
        <p>''We agree that the data released today indicates systemic problems with care in the state of New Jersey,'' said Dr. Joseph Sokolowski, chairman of the Medical Society of New Jersey's Medical Review and Accrediting Council.</p>
        <p>Gary Carter, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said, ''The key thing here is improving results, not ranking.''</p>
        <p>The state commissioner of health and senior services, Christine Grant, issued a statement calling the situation ''unacceptable,'' and said she would call on members of the industry within the coming weeks to explain what efforts they were making to improve. Officials were at a loss to explain why New Jersey ranked so low.</p>
        <p>Jerry Flanagan, a health industry analyst with the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, said money might have had something to do with the situation.</p>
