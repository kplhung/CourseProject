        <p>In the first debate of the 2000 presidential campaign, at the University of Massachusetts, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore engaged in blunt condemnations of each other's proposals.

        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush presented starkly different stands on issues ranging from taxes to abortion to oil drilling tonight as Mr. Gore repeatedly cast Mr. Bush as a friend of the rich and Mr. Bush upbraided his rival as a Washington insider with big promises and few accomplishments.</p>
        <p>In the first debate of the 2000 presidential campaign, at the University of Massachusetts, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore engaged in blunt condemnations of each other's proposals. Even when attacking, they smiled their way through the 90-minute encounter. They steered clear of personal criticisms until the final few minutes, when Mr. Bush questioned the vice president's credibility and his involvement in the campaign fund-raising scandals of 1996. [Transcript, Page A30.]</p>
        <p>Neither candidate mentioned President Clinton, but from the opening of the debate to its last moments, Mr. Bush criticized the vice president as part of an administration that squandered its opportunities to make progress on issues like prescription drugs and Social Security.</p>
        <p>Portraying himself as governor of a large state who effectively reached out to Republicans and Democrats alike, Mr. Bush assailed Mr. Gore as deeply entrenched in a poll-driven Washington culture that had little to show for itself.</p>
        <p>In doing so, he addressed persistent criticism that he was unprepared for the presidency.</p>
        <p>''I fully recognize I'm not of Washington,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I'm from Texas. And he's got a lot of experience. But so do I. And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union. I've had a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.''</p>
        <p>Tonight was the first opportunity for tens of millions of Americans to assess the contenders for more than a flash in a television commercial or on the evening news.</p>
        <p>Besides being the most watched single event of the campaign thus far, with an estimated audience of 75 million, the confrontation took on even greater significance because the contest is disturbingly close: just 35 days before the election, most polls show the race in a statistical dead heat.</p>
        <p>In delivering their pitches, both contenders offered distinct philosophies as to how they would approach governing and the presidency. Mr. Gore spoke of proposals that would help Americans at every income level and embraced views favored by liberals, like abortion rights and protecting the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush unabashedly referred to conservative principles and underscored his party's long-held tenets that the federal government is too powerful and that the military needs to be strengthened. But his muted response to questions about abortion made it clear that he, like Mr. Gore, was making his case to the sliver of swing voters likely to determine the outcome of the race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said his opponent had accomplished little in his eight years in office. ''Look,'' he said, ''let's forget all the politics and all the finger-pointing and get some positive things done on Medicare and prescription drugs and Social Security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, not wanting to invoke Mr. Clinton, refrained from agressively defending the administration,  instead turning his fire on Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>In a phrase he repeated again and again, Mr. Gore asserted that the Texas governor's tax plan was tilted to the rich. ''He would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Now, I think those are wrong priorities.'' He mentioned the ''wealthiest 1 percent'' 10 times during the debate.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Bush said tartly said that the vice president was guilty of ''fuzzy math'' and trying to ''scare'' the people with inaccurate depictions of his proposals. ''This man is running on 'Medi-scare,' '' Mr. Bush said after Mr. Gore asserted that under the governor's Medicare prescription drug plan ''95 percent of all seniors'' would get no assistance for four or five years.</p>
        <p>Both candidates, the scions of famous political fathers, tried to show good humor throughout the debate. The vice president spoke somewhat hurriedly and seemed determined to keep a pleasant demeanor. At several points Mr. Gore sighed loudly at Mr. Bush's answers. When Mr. Bush voiced positions that the vice president agreed with, Mr. Gore noted their agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore often appeared calm but still jumped in constantly, betraying his eagerness to debate. He knowingly violated the rules, saying, ''I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions'' and proceeded to ask one of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was on the attack from the outset and proved much more assertive about the vice president's vulnerabilities than Mr. Gore was about the governor's. But Mr. Bush, who has far less debating experience than the vice president, seemed more at ease and less scripted than he did in most of his encounters during the Republican primaries.</p>
        <p>Mindful, perhaps, that voters do tire of negative politics and personal attacks -- and that they sometimes backfire -- Mr. Bush resisted references to Mr. Clinton and his administration's scandals. And Mr. Gore, seeking not to appear mean-spirited, did not dwell on what for months he and his campaign have assailed as failures in Mr. Bush's Texas record.</p>
        <p>But in the closing minutes of the debate, Jim Lehrer of PBS, the moderator, asked Mr. Bush about Mr. Gore's ethical conduct, and the governor jumped at the opportunity.</p>
        <p>After crediting Mr. Gore for loving his wife and family, Mr. Bush referred pointedly to the vice president's explanation for his involvement in a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple. ''The thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, 'No controlling legal authority.' I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House. I believe they've moved that sign 'the buck stops here' on the Lincoln Bedroom, and that's not good for the country. It's not right.''</p>
        <p>He did not stop there. ''I don't know the man well,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but I have been disappointed about how he and his administration has conducted the fund-raising affairs. You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fund-raiser is just not my view of responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, seeking to rise above the criticism, responded, ''I think we ought to attack our country's problems, not attack each other. I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person. You may want to focus on scandals. I want to focus on results.''</p>
        <p>As they stood side by side at lecterns in a red-carpeted gymnasium here, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush tangled over strikingly different visions -- and prescriptions -- on major issues of the day as they were questioned by Mr. Lehrer.</p>
        <p>On the issue of RU-486, a newly approved abortion drug, Mr. Bush, who opposes abortion, first tried to play down the difference between himself and Mr. Gore. He said he did not believe as president he would have the power to overturn the decision last week by the Food and Drug Administration to legalize the drug.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who ''look at the Constitution as sacred'' and that he believed in ''strict constructionists.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore sought to sharpen their differences on abortion by warning that Mr. Bush had said he would make appointments in the mold of the court's two staunchest conservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The vice president said of Mr. Bush's references to strict constructionists, ''Those are code words'' for choosing justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
        <p>Sharp differences also cropped up between the two men over when -- and under what conditions -- they would commit American forces around the world. While the candidates agreed they would deploy troops whenever national security was threatened, they disagreed on the definition of national security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he would consider using troops to prevent mass killings. Mr. Bush said he would not use force to promote ''nation building.''</p>
        <p>Questioned about what he would do about Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to step down as president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Mr. Gore said of the elections there last week, ''We should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia -- as they call Serbia plus Montenegro.'' That support, he said, should include the prospect of lifted sanctions, which would be ''a very strong incentive that we have given them to do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said it was ''time for the man to leave.'' But when he suggested that the Russians should ''step up and lead,'' playing a prominent role in mediating the outcome of the elections, Mr. Gore demurred, saying, ''We might not like the result that comes out of that.''</p>
        <p>The candidates clashed at length about their rival plans to offer prescription drug insurance for older Americans and about who would stand up to special interests. Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush's remedies were too tied to corporations. ''Big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal,'' he said. ''They oppose mine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush then grimaced, and offered a swift rebuttal, mentioning two groups that have contributed generously to the vice president. ''I've been standing up to big Hollywood and big trial lawyers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush approached tonight's event with somewhat opposite objectives: Mr. Gore, who already is viewed by many Americans as having more command of the issues, sought to display a sunnier side and not portray himself as a slashing, even mean-spirited candidate, as sometimes happened in his debates in the Democratic primaries. Mr. Bush, by contrast, tried to underscore his command of the issues and his comfort in policy. At first blush, he did not seem to commit any blunders, although he was at times less facile than Mr. Gore in his responses.</p>
        <p>The event was unusual in that in many presidential debates in recent years, the two candidates knew each other or had at least been photographed together. The candidates of four years ago, for example, President Clinton and Bob Dole, had appeared dozens of times together to hammer out legislation. But both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have said they do not know each other. Mr. Bush said recently that he met his opponent eight years ago.</p>
        <p>The third-party candidates, Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, were excluded by the sponsor of the debate, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission determined that those two politicians -- whose support in the polls registers in the low single percentages -- did not draw enough popular support to merit inclusion.</p>
        <p>Tonight's debate was the most traditional of the three. On Tuesday, in Winston-Salem, N.C., the two men will sit at a table with Mr. Lehrer. On Oct. 17, the format will be a town meeting, where citizens can pose questions to Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>The vice-presidential candidates will engage in their own debate on Thursday in Danville, Ky.</p>
        <p>As recently as a month ago, it appeared that the first presidential debate would not even take place in Boston. Advisers to Mr. Bush balked at the notion of having the event in such a Democratic state, and at a site that is nearby the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. But faced with criticism that he was trying to avoid debates, Mr. Bush relented on his objections about the sites.</p>
        <p>Outside the library complex, though, there was nary a sign of a Bush supporter. Several thousand protesters amassed, mostly union supporters in work boots but with a strong contingent of pierced young supporters of Mr. Nader.</p>
        <p>With no Republicans to argue with, some of the Nader supporters and Gore supporters took to arguing with each other. The most common chant was, ''Let Ralph debate!''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW  Correction:  October 6, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, a phrase was omitted in some editions on Wednesday, altering the meaning, in a front-page article about the debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. As written, the article said the confrontation took on greater significance because the contest was ''disturbingly close FOR BOTH CANDIDATES.''</p>
