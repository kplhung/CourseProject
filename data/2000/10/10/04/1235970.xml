        <p>Ellis Burks, the 36-year-old right fielder, was among the first players in the Giants' clubhouse today, arriving early to enjoy the perks of what may be the strongest home-stadium advantage in Major League Baseball.</p>
        <p>Never mind batting practice or the Mets' scouting report; Burks came to Pacific Bell Park to take a swim. Specifically, to jump in the Giants' high-tech training pool and loosen his oft-injured knees.</p>
        <p>Asked to contrast the bejeweling Pacific Bell Park and the bedeviling Candlestick Park, Burks laughed as though he had to choose between arthritis and a rejuvenated career.</p>
        <p>''We just had a tub at Candlestick, a tin tub,'' Burks said. ''It's just night and day. You don't have the cold weather. The winds are not nearly as strong. We've got state-of-the-art facilities. And there's something about playing at home in front of a sellout crowd every night that gets you going. We weren't used to that. It's more of a baseball atmosphere here. Everything is right on top of you. It's the difference between playing in front of 45,000 fans and 15,000.''</p>
        <p>The Giants view their new stadium as their trump card when dealing with the Mets in the three-of-five-game division series that begins Wednesday. The Giants say it was no coincidence that team revenues more than doubled to $135 million and huge dividends were reaped on the field in their first season at Pacific Bell.</p>
        <p>''It has been the single biggest factor in our success this year,'' said Peter Magowan, the Giants' president. ''In the past, we'd come back from a road trip against, say, the Expos and start a homestand on a Wednesday night and 12,000 people would be here for us. It was demoralizing at times. Here, the energy from the crowd is obvious every night.''</p>
        <p>First baseman J. T. Snow said: ''It's like going to work in a nice office. You're just in a little better mood when you get here.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' 55-26 home record was their best since 1962, and tied the Mets for tops in the majors. And the Giants point to a four-game sweep of the Mets here in May as a crucial moment in making this park miserable for visiting teams. Jeff Kent, the ex-Met, led the assault, hitting three home runs in the series, including a three-run homer in the 11th inning for an 8-5 victory on May 3.</p>
        <p>''That was an important game for the psychology of this franchise,'' said Larry Baer, the team's executive vice president. ''That series and that game gave us a lot of confidence that we could play well in our new ballpark.''</p>
        <p>The Giants had lost their first six games at Pacific Bell and were 10-13, five games behind the division-leading Arizona Diamondbacks. But they shaped up and won the N.L. West by 11 games over the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
        <p>''We hope they never do figure it out,'' Kent said, referring to the Mets' woes here. ''What has been a benefit for us is the fact that this is a quality, beautiful, odd-shaped ballpark, and it doesn't bug us. I think a lot of players come in here and get wrapped up in its beauty and quirky corners in right field.</p>
        <p>''It looks like a short porch out there, too, so pitchers might be intimidated by that a bit. But this is a very fair ballpark.''</p>
        <p>Visiting teams can be fooled into thinking Pacific Bell is a power hitter's paradise like Enron Field in Houston or Coors Field in Denver. But the Giants say that pitching and defense are rewarded.</p>
        <p>''When teams come in here, they think they're going to hit a lot of home runs and score a lot,'' Snow said, ''but it's not really like that. This park can affect their minds like that, which can help us.''</p>
        <p>The power alleys measure 404 feet to left-center field and 421 to right center. Although it is only 309 feet down the right-field line, a home run needs to carry over a 25-foot wall. The winds are gentle, too, usually blowing in from right center and out to left center.</p>
