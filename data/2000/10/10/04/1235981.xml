        <p>Detectives were seeking a Queens man yesterday for questioning in the investigation into missing money from a prominent Roman Catholic church in Forest Hills.</p>
        <p>The police said the man, George Schweigert, 39, had received money from Msgr. Thomas J. Gradilone, the former pastor at the church, Our Lady Queen of Martyrs.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Bishop Thomas V. Daily, of the Archdiocese of Brooklyn, said that the parish was missing as much as $2 million from its accounts and weekly collections, and that much of the money had passed from Monsignor Gradilone's hands ''to one or more individuals in amounts that greatly exceed the bounds of charity.''</p>
        <p>The case is being investigated by Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, whose office declined to comment publicly yesterday.</p>
        <p>But two law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they were investigating whether some of the parish's money had been given to Mr. Schweigert by Monsignor Gradilone. The officials said that the two men were acquainted but that they did not know how well. ''Until we find him and we interview him, we don't know,'' one of the officials said.</p>
        <p>The officials said Mr. Schweigert was wanted only for questioning. No warrant has been issued for his arrest, and he has not been charged with any crime.</p>
        <p>Officials at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, one of the largest and most well established parishes in the borough, declined to comment yesterday. But one church worker said yesterday that Mr. Schweigert had visited the church intermittently since the late 1980's, and that Monsignor Gradilone often gave him food and sometimes lent him money. Mr. Schweigert, the worker said, often called and asked to speak to the monsignor.</p>
        <p>Residents of the quiet street in Mastic Beach, Suffolk County, where Monsignor Gradilone had owned a small home until he sold it last year said they did not know Mr. Schweigert.</p>
