        <p>THE Summer Games were over now, the Olympic ''family'' was splitting up and going in hundreds, thousands, of directions.</p>
        <p>Finally, I was free to search for Jack Johnson.</p>
        <p>Since my childhood, the exploits of the legendary boxer had been ingrained in my soul. For folks my grandmother's age, Johnson was the real-life incarnation of John Henry, the original, albeit mythic ''bad'' brother. There were so many tales about Johnson it was difficult to know where reality ended and myth began. But to me, legend and reality were all good. And it began here.</p>
        <p>Now I wanted to stand where Johnson stood, see what his eyes saw as he changed the world.</p>
        <p>It seems odd that such a significant piece of United States history and black sports history unfolded here in Sydney. The day after Christmas 1908 -- appropriately, the British holiday called Boxing Day -- Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion of the world.</p>
        <p>At The Stadium at Rushcutter's Bay, Johnson beat Tommy Burns of Canada, who was being pummeled when ringside police officers stopped the bout in the 14th round.</p>
        <p>The fight not only marked the historic ascent of a black champion, it introduced a new kind of black athlete: confident and unafraid. Johnson got under the skin of many white Americans and some blacks, too, who feared retribution. That he openly had relationships with white women just added fuel to the fire.</p>
        <p>Yet his flash, his bodacious manner of going about the business of sport, begat an approach that would be identified with African-American athletes, appropriately or not. His style would captivate, enrage and by the end of the century become the foundation of the United States sports industry.</p>
        <p>Johnson couldn't afford to be reserved. He had to shout or he would not be heard; he had to flaunt his blackness or he would not be seen. He was courageous, yet he was called a coward; he was fit and talented, but he was made out to be a monster. He was clearly a superior boxer, but they said he was inferior.</p>
        <p>The great heavyweights refused to fight Johnson, who ended up chasing Burns around the world before finally cornering him in Australia. An Australian-born promoter, Hugh (Huge Deal) McIntosh offered so much money -- reportedly $:6,000 -- that Burns accepted the fight.</p>
        <p>One of the moments that inspired me occurred before the bout even began. Burns came out wearing elastic bandages on his elbows. Johnson immediately protested and said he would not fight if Burns wore the protective gear. Johnson had made concession after concession to get this fight: his share was only $:1,000, and he did not get the referee he wanted. (The promoter, McIntosh, was in the ring.) But Burns's elbow protection was the final straw.</p>
        <p>According to Jeff Wells's book ''Boxing Day: The Fight That Changed the World'' (HarperCollins Australia, November 1999), thousands booed and jeered as McIntosh told Johnson that the rules allowed bandages; Johnson knew that the rules were manufactured. Finally, a boxing icon, Larry Foley, was summoned into the ring and said the bandages were illegal. Johnson had won a personal victory that provided him with the backbone he would need for the next seven years of his reign as champion.</p>
        <p>The fight was perfunctory. Johnson knocked Burns down in the opening seconds of the fight and easily won the remaining 13 rounds. He taunted Burns, who had his fair share to say. Johnson's taunts, his ability to toy with the smaller fighter, would be the talk of the media: ''The World's Talking Champion,'' one headline read. ''The Grinning of Johnson,'' read another.</p>
        <p>The writer Jack London, who covered the fight, was outraged by Johnson's performance and wired back a story challenging Jim Jeffries, a champion more renowned than Burns, to come out of retirement. He urged Jeffries, who had previously refused to box Johnson, to ''wipe the golden smile'' off Johnson's face.</p>
        <p>Thus began the unofficial genesis for the Great White Hope syndrome, the search for the white athlete to topple the black athlete, or to succeed in the black athlete's world.</p>
        <p>That mentality has not changed. During the Sydney Games, Kenteris Konstantinos of Greece was an upset winner in the 200-meter sprint. I wondered how long it would take before someone asked the race question. Not long. Three questions into the post-race interview, someone gushed: ''How does it feel to be a fast white guy?''</p>
        <p>Two years after beating Burns, in an equally impressive performance in Nevada, Johnson annihilated Jeffries.</p>
        <p>Searching for the place where Johnson made history was not easy.</p>
        <p>The Stadium at Rushcutter's Bay was torn down about 20 years ago.The bay was the scene of the Olympic yachting competition, and a volunteer there explained its name. Rushes are thick water weeds, rush cutters were the workers who cut them.</p>
        <p>She pointed me in the direction of where the stadium once stood. I walked through Rushcutter's Bay Park and then up a steep hill. A man in the area said I'd passed the spot. Walk back down the steep hill, he said; go back to the park, pass a car dealership.</p>
        <p>But by that time, I had to abandon the search. I needed to watch Venus Williams play her quarterfinal singles match, in a different part of town, down a different path in sports history.</p>
        <p>A week later, I headed off for Rushcutter's Bay at dusk. The clerk at an Aboriginal art gallery recalled how she had been to the Rushcutter's Bay stadium to see the Bee Gees, Eric Burdon and War, and Black Sabbath. She also thought a car dealership was there now.</p>
        <p>So I took the train and walked down that steep hill to past the B.M.W. and Audi showroom. A man in his 60's was there, waiting for a cab. He said the place I was looking for was farther down the road, in a luxury housing complex called White City.</p>
        <p>So I walked a half-mile farther; a clerk in a hotel pointed me in the direction of a narrow walkway that went under a white arched sign: Welcome to White City.</p>
        <p>By then, it was dark with a sky accented by a crescent moon. There were outlines of finely coiffed tennis courts on my left, a large playing field to my right. I looked up and saw the backside of the beautiful Sydney skyline.</p>
        <p>On a lighted tennis court, four men were playing doubles. I asked them about the stadium, and two of them remembered it well. They said it was 200 meters, about 700 feet, in back of me.</p>
        <p>In this corner of an affluent suburb in East Sydney, there was nothing but parkland and memories. This wasn't a center ring, but it was close enough to the epicenter of history. I had come to the end of the earth, and found the beginning of a trail.</p>
        <p>The deed was done; the mission achieved.</p>
        <p>I could go home now.</p>
