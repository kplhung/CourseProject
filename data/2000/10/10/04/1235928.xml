        <p>''You need to look at the legs and examine the jaws, and you need to see if the lines on the head are straight,'' Meng Yu was saying, admiring the animals before him like any connoisseur of fine breeds.</p>
        <p>Wang Delu, who sat nearby in the back-alley market, said: ''Now just look at this one, I call him the gold-tipped general. See, there's a patch of gold at the top of his head. He should make a good fighter.''</p>
        <p>The men were talking, of course, about crickets. Autumn is the cricket-fighting season in China, a time when aficionados spend their days examining little brown bugs that were captured in distant fields, noting obscure physical details and behaviors in a never-ending quest for the true gladiator.</p>
        <p>These cricket mavens apply the lore of centuries as well as a gambler's intuition to a search for insects that will dominate all rivals in battle,  and along the way, many of the masters dearly hope, win their owners a bundle of cash from sideline betting.</p>
        <p>The bugs are not to be confused with the crickets kept in little cages and ornate gourds as companions, which include large, colorful species and tiny ones with especially mellifluous chirps. Fighting crickets are no more than an inch and a half long and to the untrained eye they look like, well, ordinary brown crickets. Always males, they must have the physique and character to go head to head in the eight-inch plastic arena -- to butt and grab and flip an opponent until it surrenders or is maimed.</p>
        <p>Cricket matches have been popular for at least 1,000 years and the sport was once popular with emperors as well as commoners. Today, neighborhood bouts are still sometimes staged among friends for small antes or sheer sport, while serious cricket fanciers in Beijing, Shanghai and a few other cities belong to associations that nurture the tradition, holding a national championship each October.</p>
        <p>But more and more, the sport is becoming dominated by hard-core gamblers, who stage secret matches for stakes that run into the thousands of dollars, risking police raids for the illegal betting. In big matches, fans say, crickets are even doped with a secret formula that is said to make them fiercer.</p>
        <p>People with a passion for crickets like Lan Yindong, 44, whose father and grandfather also sold cricket paraphernalia in Beijing, rue the sport's decline in social status and its close association with gambling.</p>
        <p>''Cricket fighting attracts so many hooligans now, it's not like before,'' said Mr. Lan, to the soft purr of an especially fine-sounding cricket he kept nearby.</p>
        <p>On a recent night, about 20 cricket masters, members of two neighborhood teams from the loosely organized Beijing Cricket Society, met at an old courtyard-style house for a friendly match.</p>
        <p>The men, avid hobbyists in their 40's, 50's and 60's who included an engineer, midlevel city officials and retired workers, smoked and talked as they put a female in each fighter's jar before the match, said to stir up their fighting juices. They used a small scale to weigh each fighter, matching up equals for the bouts. Then the men became quiet as the battles began, with crickets dropped into the arena two at a time.</p>
        <p>Many matches ended in unsatisfying TKO's as one of the bugs refused to fight, repeatedly running away even as a master stroked him with a fine brush. But the bolder fighters rushed at each other relentlessly, grasping each other with their large jaws, rising up together with their legs tautly extended like two miniature sumo wrestlers and drawing smiles and laughs from the crowd. They twisted and flipped their opponents judo-style until one bug retreated or was declared a clear loser.</p>
        <p>The winners will fight again another day, the men said -- often as many as five or six times before they lose their edge. Losers are unceremoniously tossed away.</p>
        <p>According to ''An Illustrated Guide to Crickets,'' by the Shanghai experts Bian Wenhua and Yang Ping, crickets have three main fighting styles.</p>
        <p>A combatant with a strategy of  ''creep like a tiger, fight like a snake'' stalks the enemy slowly at first. The ''force of a fine steed'' fighter, the book says, is one that ''charges like the wind, valiantly forging straight ahead,'' and this is a frequent trait of the greatest champions. The ''listen for sound, look for the enemy'' cricket lies in wait, ambushing the enemy after hearing it chirp.</p>
        <p>In the back-street market where he sets up shop, Mr. Meng opened up the dozens of small clay jars before him, each holding a cricket for sale, most at prices ranging from 35 cents to a few dollars. But exceptional-looking specimens can sell for hundreds of dollars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meng described some of the subtle characteristics that mavens use to categorize their crickets: the six possible colors on the body and head, the straightness of the ''fighting lines'' on the head, the size of the legs and jaws. Good-looking crickets must be tested out for aggressiveness, too.</p>
        <p>But when all is said and done, Mr. Meng said, ''it's not something you can explain.''</p>
        <p>''Every man has his own way of looking at a cricket.'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It's like in boxing, when some people think Tyson is the best, some people look at Holyfield and think he's the best,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lan, in the same market, said: ''You get your own feeling about a cricket. You just draw on your experience. If it has good fighting lines but the head is too small, those great  lines don't necessarily mean anything. And you need clean, pure-colored jaws.''</p>
        <p>How, a visitor asked, could the color of the jaws affect a cricket's ability to fight? ''That is too deep a matter to explain,'' Mr. Lan said. ''But if everything else about a cricket is good,'' he added, ''maybe the discolored teeth don't matter that much.''</p>
        <p>As every cricket fancier knows, the top fighters all come from a single region of eastern China, in Shandong Province. Thousands of men from around the country travel there in August and September to buy large quantities from farmers who have plucked the summer's yield of bugs from their fields.</p>
        <p>''Shandong has the best water and soil, but every county has different qualities and some years are better than others,'' Mr. Lan said, sounding more like an expert on chateau burgundies than on crickets.</p>
        <p>''People from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, all over the world go to Shandong to get fighting crickets.''</p>
        <p>Through the fall -- the crickets live for only three months -- players search endlessly for the best, some making multiple trips to Shandong and constantly scouring the street markets for that special find.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lan said he sold the best cricket he ever found -- one from Shandong's best county, with excellent traits but still untested in battle -- to an avid fan for more than $700. So did this fine, costly animal win in the arena? ''I can't say for sure,'' Mr. Lan said with a smile.</p>
