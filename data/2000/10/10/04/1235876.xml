      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>BY day, Sapori d'Ischia is a bright and thriving Italian specialty market in Woodside, Queens. Scattered among its attractive assortments of meats, cheeses, pastas and condiments are a dozen tables, where workers from the neighborhood sit cheek-by-cheese with hanging provolones and wheels of Parmigiano-Reggiano, eating heaping platters of rustic dishes like sausage and peppers, or veal with mushrooms, served at the counter for $4.50 each.</p>
        <p>But a transformation occurs around 5 p.m. The trays of hot food are put away, along with the display of pizza by the slice. Candles are lighted, soft music begins to play and a waiter takes over, welcoming guests, handing out menus and offering wine. Almost every table has a ''reserved'' sign on it.</p>

        <p>BY day, Sapori d'Ischia is a bright and thriving Italian specialty market in Woodside, Queens. Scattered among its attractive assortments of meats, cheeses, pastas and condiments are a dozen tables, where workers from the neighborhood sit cheek-by-cheese with hanging provolones and wheels of Parmigiano-Reggiano, eating heaping platters of rustic dishes like sausage and peppers, or veal with mushrooms, served at the counter for $4.50 each.</p>
        <p>But a transformation occurs around 5 p.m. The trays of hot food are put away, along with the display of pizza by the slice. Candles are lighted, soft music begins to play and a waiter takes over, welcoming guests, handing out menus and offering wine. Almost every table has a ''reserved'' sign on it.</p>
        <p>If the transformation seems unlikely, so is the site, an industrial block where the restaurant is barely discernible among the garages and auto glass shops that line this part of 37th Avenue. But this is the area where the father-and-son owners of Sapori, Frank and Anthony Galano, have their wholesale business. When they decided to open a combination retail market and cafe early last year, they simply placed it next door.</p>
        <p>When they selected a chef, the Galanos, who are originally from the island of Ischia off Naples, kept it in the family, more or less, hiring Saverio Verde, who is from Naples and whom Anthony Galano described as ''like a cousin.'' Mr. Verde, who previously cooked at Mezzogiorno and Le Madri in Manhattan, has a brick oven at his disposal, from which the kitchen turns out fine individual pizzas ($6.50 to $9), with thin, crisp, beautifully smooth crusts.</p>
        <p>You could easily make a meal of the pizza, but the small menu has other excellent choices, like budino di carciofi, or artichoke puree ($7.50), an Ischian specialty that is soft as flan and set atop a luscious combination of grilled pancetta and peppers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verde makes another excellent appetizer of two grilled portobello mushrooms sandwiching oven-dried tomatoes, grilled eggplant, caramelized onions and mozzarella, a savory fusion of earthy and sweet. A special one night, soft polenta with robiola cheese and fragrant mushrooms ($8), was not unusual, but it was delicious.</p>
        <p>If the restaurant has an obvious weakness, it is seafood. The appetizer of grilled shrimp ($8) was thoroughly tasteless. Though a main course of grilled seafood ($15) included fine scallops and calamari in a sauce of garlic and olive oil, it also had those tasteless shrimp and pieces of overcooked salmon.</p>
        <p>Redemption comes with fettuccine al'Antonio ($12), an excellent and extraordinarily rich dish of fresh pasta with cream and prosciutto prepared at the table in a bowl carved out of a wheel of parmesan. The waiter shaves some of the cheese, which melts into the creamy pasta, and adds a blessedly small bit of white truffle oil, which amplifies the richness without being obtrusive. I also liked rigatoni with eggplant and ricotta in tomato sauce ($8.50) and bistecca alla nonna ($14), a thin steak, wonderfully charred.</p>
        <p>Sapori offers only a few wines, including a pedestrian Chianti and an inky negroamaro. The Galanos say humbly that they don't want to offer wines too fancy for their food, but I think they should relax and offer at least a few more choices.</p>
        <p>Keeping with the quirky nature of the operation, the Galanos also cling to a set of rules that they hope will distinguish them from Italian-American restaurants. They will not serve lemon peel with espresso, cheese on seafood dishes or ice cubes for dropping into red wine. Nor will they serve butter or skim milk. Less good-naturedly, they also will not serve tap water. Customers are limited to Valverde water at $3 a liter.</p>
        <p>By the way, the store remains open while the trattoria is serving, so if you find yourself staring longingly at that provolone, grab it.</p>
