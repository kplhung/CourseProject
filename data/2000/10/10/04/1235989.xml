        <p>With a tip of the hat to its more than a half-century as a manufacturing plant for Brooks Brothers, the blue-blooded clothier that once produced 10,000 ties a week there, a 180,000-square-foot building at 36-36 33rd Street in Long Island City, Queens, is being turned into build-to-suit office space that its developers hope will be more upscale than other nearby commercial buildings, whose tenants are mostly new media or small manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The conversion was the idea of Steve Valiotis, a developer and the founder of Alma Realty, based in Astoria.

        <p>With a tip of the hat to its more than a half-century as a manufacturing plant for Brooks Brothers, the blue-blooded clothier that once produced 10,000 ties a week there, a 180,000-square-foot building at 36-36 33rd Street in Long Island City, Queens, is being turned into build-to-suit office space that its developers hope will be more upscale than other nearby commercial buildings, whose tenants are mostly new media or small manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The conversion was the idea of Steve Valiotis, a developer and the founder of Alma Realty, based in Astoria. He is convinced that the former Brooks Brothers site, once renovated, will offer the aesthetics and the flexibility to appeal not just to the growing number of new-media companies that are moving to Long Island City, but also to traditional office users, especially those feeling pinched by high rents in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valiotis said he acquired the building in May 1999 from Investment Properties Associates, a Manhattan partnership that owns commercial properties, for $6.6 million. He estimates the construction cost at $12 million to $15 million, depending on the tenants' needs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valiotis and his company want to maintain the warehouse feel of the five-story building, retaining features such as the building's very high ceilings, which range from 14 to 20 feet, and the roughly 250 very large windows, which measure about 12 feet in both height and width.</p>
        <p>To create the high-grade office space that he is looking for, he plans to give his building plenty of amenities. It already offers prospective tenants virtually unobstructed views of a wide swath of Manhattan from its top three floors. But Mr. Valiotis wants to add niceties like granite and marble in the common areas, a second-floor roof deck that will have a staircase leading down to a 3,000-square-foot restaurant, two outdoor smoking terraces, an on-site art gallery and a 1,000-square-foot health club for tenants.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to create a particular niche in Long Island City,'' said Steven C. Manis, the director of design and development at Alma.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Manis, the building should be available for lease by Jan. 1, at annual rents in the middle $20 range per square foot. That cost, he said, would include the use of one and a half parking spaces for every 1,000 feet leased.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manis said that no tenants had yet signed leases, mostly because his company wanted to finish work on more of the building's common areas before starting to market it last month. He added that his company was not focusing on a particular type of tenant. ''We have the flexibility to go as little as 2,500 square feet per tenant to the length of a full floor, which is about 33,000 square feet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The building was originally built in 1913 as a paper goods factory for the New York Consolidated Card Company. Brooks Brothers took over in 1947, Mr. Manis said. A Brooks Brothers spokesman said that the building had once been the company's main alteration sites, as well as producing ties and such formal wear accessories as cummerbunds.</p>
        <p>Brooks Brothers moved out of the building in February, when its lease was up. Mr. Manis said the building had attracted prospective tenants because of its size and its proximity to Manhattan, as well as plans for a 270-car on-site garage set to begin construction in 30 to 45 days.</p>
        <p>So far, renovations have been more cosmetic than structural, Mr. Valiotis said, although his company did knock down a 130-foot chimney.  Workers are now replacing all the original windows with modern, insulated units.</p>
        <p>One thing that is not expected to change any time soon is the building's unusual configuration. It is more than 450 feet long and in many places roughly 70 feet wide. While some local developers wonder whether the building is too narrow to allow it to be easily configured to a particular tenant's needs, Mr. Manis says that the length will allow sunlight to reach more tenants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valiotis, who owns roughly four dozen properties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, says that it is just a matter of time before office tenants in areas like Manhattan become fed up with the ''ridiculous'' rents they are now being charged and begin a wide-scale migration to areas like Long Island City. ''Space in our building is going to cost half of what it does in Manhattan,'' he said. ''That is going to attract a lot of people.''</p>
