        <p>At the age of 77, Norman Mailer spends three hours every day at his beachfront home in Provincetown, Mass., writing a big novel that may -- or may not -- be his last.</p>
        <p>''My energy's fairly good, my mind's fairly good, but my bones are starting to speak out every day,'' Mr. Mailer said over the phone. He has arthritis in both knees and sometimes has trouble walking. ''I'll keep writing as long as I possibly can,'' he said. ''I just don't want to end up an old writer who isn't very good.''</p>

        <p>At the age of 77, Norman Mailer spends three hours every day at his beachfront home in Provincetown, Mass., writing a big novel that may -- or may not -- be his last.</p>
        <p>''My energy's fairly good, my mind's fairly good, but my bones are starting to speak out every day,'' Mr. Mailer said over the phone. He has arthritis in both knees and sometimes has trouble walking. ''I'll keep writing as long as I possibly can,'' he said. ''I just don't want to end up an old writer who isn't very good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer, who wants to guard his privacy while writing his novel, is prepared for some repercussions from what he called the most extensive and candid television interview in his career of more than 50 years. The interview covers not only his personal life, including his stabbing of his wife 40 years ago, but also unexpected insights into his fervor for the United States and his fascination with Richard M. Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson and other presidents, as well as his literary ambitions. The interview is part of a 90-minute documentary about him on PBS's ''American Masters'' on Wednesday at 10 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
        <p>The interview was culled from a series of question-and-answer sessions conducted two years ago by Jean-Pierre Catherine and Michael Seiler for European television. The sessions totaled more than 20 hours, three hours of which are to be shown on French television on Oct. 29 and Nov. 5.</p>
        <p>''I've always felt that my relationship to the United States is analogous to a marriage,'' Mr. Mailer said in the interview. ''I love this country. I hate it. I get angry at it. I feel close to it. I'm charmed by it. I'm repelled by it. And it's a marriage that's gone on for let's say at least 50 years of my writing life, and in the course of that, what's happened? It's gotten worse. It's not what it used to be.''</p>
        <p>But then Mr. Mailer said, ''I certainly do have this feeling of affection for the absolute sense of intellectual freedom that exists as a live nerve, a live wire, right through the center of American life.'' He added: ''Every time I get totally discouraged with this country, I remind myself, 'No, the fact is that finally we can really say what we think, and some extraordinary things have come out of that.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer has, of course, never been shy about boldly promoting himself and his books, and his penchant for controversy has been unwavering. But in his televised comments Mr. Mailer offers a comprehensive, blunt and even melancholy look at his career, including the two episodes that he terms the most horrific of his life and has generally refused to discuss.</p>
        <p>One took place in November 1960, when after an all-night party he stabbed his second wife, Adele Morales, with a penknife. She did not press charges. The other was his sponsorship of Jack Henry Abbott, the author of a harrowing book of prison writings, ''In the Belly of the Beast,'' who was paroled from his prison sentence for manslaughter and went on to kill again in 1981.</p>
        <p>Of the stabbing 40 years ago, Mr. Mailer said, ''It changed everything in my life. It is the one act I can look back on and regret for the rest of my life. And it happened out of the way I was living. There's no question about that. What happened is I was getting into more and more of a violent edge.'' He blamed the episode on ''dark, ugly and competitive streaks.''</p>
        <p>''We are as ugly as animals in our fashion, and unless we deal with the ugliness in ourselves, unless we deal with the violence in ourselves, the brutality in ourselves, and find some way to sublimate it, just to use Freud's term, into something slightly higher, we're never going to get anywhere with anything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He spoke more ambivalently and in more detail about Mr. Abbott. A man who had spent 21 of his 33 years in prison when he began corresponding with Mr. Mailer, Mr. Abbott was released from a Utah prison in June 1981. Mr. Mailer and other New York literary figures sponsored Mr. Abbott, whose prison writing had caught their attention.</p>
        <p>Six weeks after his release, Mr. Abbott stabbed and killed Richard Adan, a part-time waiter, in a confrontation at the Binibon, an all-night diner in the East Village. Mr. Abbott later told Ricci Adan, Mr. Adan's widow, that her husband's life was ''not worth a dime.'' Mr. Abbott, now 56, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter and will be eligible for parole in June 2001.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer called it ''one of the most unpleasant episodes of my life,'' and said he felt ''completely responsible'' because Mr. Abbott was entirely unaccustomed to living in the outside world.</p>
        <p>''I knew that Jack needed a lot of help, and what he really needed was somebody who could spend a prodigious amount of time with him, every night, see him, live with him, live with him the way someone in A.A. lives with a drunk,'' Mr. Mailer said. ''I wasn't doing that. So when the crime occurred -- because I'd just been hoping things would work out all right -- when the crime occurred, I knew that I had a responsibility on that one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer said over the phone the other day from his home in Provincetown that although he never wanted to speak publicly about the Abbott case or about his own stabbing case, he felt compelled to address the subjects because of the serious and wide-ranging nature of the interviews.</p>
        <p>''I felt I had to talk about it in general terms,'' he said. ''They were the two worst episodes in my life.'' Of the assault on his wife, he said, ''I will really never talk about the stabbing in depth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer's first published novel, ''The Naked and the Dead'' (1948), dealing with his experiences in World War II, sold 200,000 copies and turned him, at 25, into one of the most celebrated postwar literary figures. Since then Mr. Mailer's interests, his prolific career and his unpredictable and confrontational personal and public life have been fixtures of the literary landscape.</p>
        <p>His interest in metaphor as a literary tool was especially evident in his works of the late 1960's, including ''Why Are We in Vietnam?'' (1967) and ''The Armies of the Night'' (1969), about the antiwar protests, for which he won his first Pulitzer Prize. His second Pulitzer Prize came in 1980 for ''The Executioner's Song,'' a documentary-style novel about Gary Gilmore, the convicted murderer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer has also written essays and nonfiction on subjects ranging from Marilyn Monroe to space exploration. He even ran for mayor of New York in 1969. His novels include ''Ancient Evenings'' (1983) and a 1,328-page book about the Central Intelligence Agency, ''Harlot's Ghost'' (1991).</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer has had six wives and nine children. ''My oldest is the same age as my wife -- she's 51,'' Mr. Mailer said on the phone, speaking of his wife, Norris Church Mailer, who published her first novel, ''Windchill Summer'' (Random House), in June. The couple moved to Provincetown from Brooklyn Heights about five years ago.</p>
        <p>''I was just getting older, and I no longer could enjoy New York,'' Mr. Mailer said. ''You get older, you get more delicate. The bad air bothered me. The traffic irritated me. If I went out and had a good time at a dinner party, it meant I didn't work nearly as well the next day. When I was younger, I could get drunk, eat a lot of rich food and get up in the morning not feeling perfect but well enough to go to work. I'm past that point. I lead an abstemious life up here in the winter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer said he had not even told his wife what his new novel was about. ''If I begin talking about it, I'll talk the book out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Asked over the phone if he was concerned that his talents would wane, Mr. Mailer replied: ''Your talent can go at anytime -- 25, 55, 105. Talent is like a Ping-Pong ball that can roll off the table.''</p>
        <p>But writing a novel, especially as he got older, was punishing, Mr. Mailer said. ''At a given moment it probably just becomes too difficult to do,'' he said. ''Writing can wreck your body. You sit there on the chair hour after hour and sweat your guts out to get a few words.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mailer added that he didn't read his contemporaries for pleasure. ''What's not realized about good novelists is that they're as competitive as good athletes. They study each other -- where the other person is good and where the person is less good. Writers are like that but don't admit it. I'll read Don DeLillo and say, 'I'm better than him there,' and 'He's better than me here.' The same with Updike, Roth, Bellow, Doctorow, all of them. We're all the same. But I don't think they'd admit it.''</p>
        <p>In his television interview, Mr. Mailer spoke about the nation's presidents over the last 50 years. He said that Mr. Nixon was a somewhat tragic figure because he was ''very bright, exceptionally intelligent.'' But Mr. Mailer said: ''He had a personality that was hopeless. He had a profound distrust of people's possibilities, and it came out in his personality.'' Mr. Mailer added, ''There was an almost indecent pleasure he took in being sentimental about all the worst things.''</p>
        <p>One intriguing part of the interview was his comments about his wartime experiences in the South Pacific. Before going overseas, Mr. Mailer said, he realized he wanted to write a great novel about the war. Once he went abroad, he took mental notes.</p>
        <p>''What surprised me most was how cool I felt,'' he said. ''There's a detachment that you need as a writer. And as a young man, I probably had more detachment than I have today. So that part of me was just looking at the battlefield, and it was certainly full of horrors. There was a lieutenant with us and a driver and another enlisted man like myself. And I think they were shocked profoundly.''</p>
        <p>''I just thought -- this is a cold and cruel thing to say, but it's the way a writer is -- I thought, 'Oh, this is good.' Not that it was good that all these people are dead. But 'Oh, it's so good for writing.' There was a sense of, 'This can be used.' ''</p>
