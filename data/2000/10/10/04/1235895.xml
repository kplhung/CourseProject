        <p>THERE are lots of flying winemakers, but only one is supersonic. His name is Michel Rolland, and he lives here in one of the more famous wine communes of the Bordeaux region. That is, he lives here now and then.</p>
        <p>A flying winemaker is an oenologist who, for a fee, will go anywhere in the world to advise another winemaker. It might be a short ''fix this, fix that, give me a call if it doesn't work'' relationship or it can be a long-term arrangement, with the consultant taking charge of winemaking for several years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rolland, a compact 46-year-old with dark hair, an infectious grin and a penchant for well-tailored suits and natty ties, has both kinds of relationships, in every part of the world where grapes will grow. ''I have about, oh, 100 clients,'' he said. ''Some come, some go, the list changes all the time.'' Mostly, it grows longer.</p>
        <p>Many winemakers are oenologists or, at least, have studied oenology in school. And many oenologists make wine, including Mr. Rolland, who owns four chateaus here and in neighboring St.-Emilion.</p>
        <p>But in recent years the term oenologist has come to refer to men and women who confine their activities to advising others. The first modern oenologist was Louis Pasteur. He spent only a few years of his life on wine, but he discovered how fermentation comes about and what role  yeasts play in changing grape juice into wine. The most famous contemporary oenologist is Emile Peynaud, now in retirement, who taught at the University of Bordeaux and consulted in France, Spain and occasionally the United States.</p>
        <p>Pasteur rarely left his laboratory; Peynaud rarely left Bordeaux. Michel Rolland returns to Bordeaux only to see local clients between trips. ''Last year I made 167 flights,'' he said. He has clients in France, many of them only minutes away. Others are in Italy, Spain, Germany, Morocco, Greece, South Africa, Chile, Argentina (where he owns another vineyard), the United States and even India, where a wine industry is just getting started.</p>
        <p>Among his newest clients in America, all in California, are Araujo, Staglin, Franciscan and St. Supery, in the Napa Valley, and Simi, in northern Sonoma County.</p>
        <p>Historically, winemaking encompasses two disciplines, oenology and viticulture, which confines itself to the vineyard and grape growing. But more and more, as winemakers come to understand how important the vineyard is to the final product, oenologists like Mr. Rolland involve themselves in grape growing.</p>
        <p>''The most important factor in the making of great wine is ripe fruit,'' Mr. Rolland said. In areas like Bordeaux and Burgundy, he said, ''ripe fruit is not always easy to obtain. A succession of mediocre vintages in Bordeaux in the 1960's made it clear, even if it was not too obvious at the time, that it's impossible to make good wine from immature grapes.''</p>
        <p>Is there a Rolland method? ''My first recipe is that I don't have a recipe,'' he said. ''Conditions are different and problems are different from one vineyard to another, from one part of a vineyard to another.''</p>
        <p>Even so, there are Rolland trademarks. He is a strong proponent of two techniques to help grapes reach full maturity: effeuillage, which means thinning out the leaves to expose the grapes to sun and air, and eclaircissage, which means reducing the number of grape bunches per vine to lessen the strain on the roots.</p>
        <p>He advocates using new oak barrels. ''Sulphuric acid develops in older barrels,'' he said. ''They say that I am a wood lover, but I use wood to  enhance the quality of the wine, not to give it a wood taste. Always, I look  for equilibrium in a wine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rolland argues for harvesting as late as possible and for long macerations to enhance color, intensity and aging ability.</p>
        <p>Not everyone agrees. Christian Moueix, whose family owns several chateaus in the same region, including the nonpareil Petrus, opts for early picking and shorter maceration for the area's dominant merlot grape, to give the wine more acidity and elegance.</p>
        <p>Some winemakers compare Rolland's style with the up-front, full-bodied wines of California. It has even been said around Bordeaux that hiring Rolland is a good way to get a good rating from Robert M. Parker Jr., the wine critic, who has always preferred the richer, softer style.</p>
        <p>''There are no secrets to what I do,'' Mr. Rolland said. ''I make wine the way I made it 20 years ago, but always with small changes. Yes, there are still winemakers who say, 'I make wine like my father and his father before him,' but you can be sure of it, those are the vineyards that are going downhill. The best way to negate quality is to ignore the technological developments and research findings of our time.''</p>
        <p>He practices what he preaches at his own properties, the chateaus Le Bon Pasteur in Pomerol, Bertineau-St. Vincent in Lalande de Pomerol, Fontenil in Canon-Fronsac and Rolland-Maillet in St.-Emilion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rolland may claim to have no secrets, but he does have something of a secret weapon: his wife, Dany, who is also an oenologist. When Michel is on the road or in the air, she looks after the dozens of local clients,  including the many small growers who patronize the Rollands' busy laboratory here in Pomerol.</p>
        <p>In spite of his workload, Mr. Rolland shows no signs of fatigue.</p>
        <p>''I like traveling,'' he said. ''I like seeing new places and hearing new ideas and learning new things.''</p>
        <p>And he is modest about his reputation. ''There are no great oenologists,'' he said. ''Only good grapes.''</p>
