        <p>The biotechnology concern Isis Pharmaceuticals will resume clinical trials of its drug for Crohn's disease, 10 months after the drug failed to show effectiveness in patients with the serious intestinal inflammation. Isis, based in Carlsbad, Calif., is expected to announce today that data from the failed trial actually showed that patients with higher levels of the drug in their blood showed a statistically significant improvement over the group receiving a placebo. The new trials, using a higher dose, are expected to take about three years. Isis stock lost two-thirds of its value in a single day last December when the failure of the trial was announced.</p>
