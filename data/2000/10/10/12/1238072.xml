        <p>NO matter how cool you might think your digital camera is, or how impressed you are by its capacity to draw upon millions of pixels to render stunning images, there always seems to be one in every crowd of potential admirers of the technology who wants nothing less than magic from your camera.</p>
        <p>This Luddite wants your digital camera to deliver an old-fashioned photograph, something that can easily slip into a wallet or a frame. And no, he or she isn't inclined to wait until you go home, plug your camera into a personal computer, open your photo-imaging software and upload your camera's snapshots.</p>
        <p>And who  wants to hang around while you click your way through color correction and cropping and then dispatch your pictures to your aging inkjet printer, which will most likely produce something better suited for the Sunday comics?</p>
        <p>Olympus America hopes to quiet the hordes who cry out for instant digital pictures. In a collaboration with Polaroid, the granddaddy of instant photography, Olympus recently introduced a digital camera that packs a built-in photo printer that spits out pictures faster than you can spell ''cheese.''</p>
        <p>The Camedia C-211 Zoom, the first camera of its kind in the United States, is a hybrid of old and new technology. It combines the Polaroid Corporation's chemical print process, using its Type 500 film, and a relatively new filmless, 2.1-megapixel digital system that stores its images on a SmartMedia card.</p>
        <p>The camera is quite a handful -- at seven inches in height, it is about twice as tall as pocket-size digital cameras like the popular Olympus D-series cameras. And the C-211, weighing in at 1.6 pounds (without batteries), can be quite a haul on vacation or at a party.</p>
        <p>And there are other drawbacks that amount to little more than annoyances, like the decision to stamp the camera's name in nearly inch-tall red letters on the front of its gray plastic body. Oddly, this camera has no optical view finder, leaving users with no choice but to stare into the camera's two-inch L.C.D. screen, which is an energy hog, to take pictures.</p>
        <p>Another drawback: the camera works best with CR-V3 lithium batteries, a newly introduced type that can produce between 200 and 500 pictures. The batteries are not rechargeable and cost about $20 for the two batteries the C-211 requires. Four common AA batteries may be used in the C-211, but their life expectancy would be sadly brief in comparison.</p>
        <p>Putting looks, weight and the need for special batteries aside, the C-211 is a fairly seamless integration of the best of the old and new, with a few well-engineered features to boot.</p>
        <p>Shooting at 2.1 megapixels, the C-211 produces much better than average high-definition pictures at 1,600 by 1,200 pixels. As with practically any mid- to high-level digital camera, the pictures can easily be uploaded to a computer through a U.S.B. cable. (PC or Mac) and saved on its removable SmartMedia card. But while the camera is designed to accept high-capacity SmartMedia cards up to 64 megabytes, the included card has only 8 megabytes, capable of storing only 21 pictures at a time. The Polaroid film pack will print 10 instant photographs.</p>
        <p>The C-211 features 3X optical zoom that is easily controlled with a dial on its back above a panel that is covered with well-placed and well-marked buttons, a  mode dial and the L.C.D. screen. Additionally, the L.C.D. screen offers a welcome option for those who are frustrated by the glare caused by bright sunshine: a switch turns off the screen's light and opens a port that uses natural light to power the L.C.D. screen.</p>
        <p>Using the C-211 as a straight digital camera is simple, offering common advantages, like an almost instant preview of pictures and recall of pictures previously shot. There are six settings for the built-in flash and a focus-setting button. There is also a 2X digital zoom, which means that once a picture is taken, a user can enlarge, in the camera, any portion of it by 100 percent. The C-211 also has a video feature that will record, without sound, up to 15 seconds of moving images.</p>
        <p>But the real fun starts when you preview a still picture and decide to print the image on the spot. Press an oversize green button twice on the back of the camera and a tiny electric motor in the camera hums; a door on top of the camera pops open and out rolls a piece of Polaroid film,  about 3 inches by 2 1/4 inches. In a few seconds, the picture, which was beamed onto the undeveloped film by a tiny projector inside the camera, emerges before your eyes and those of anyone else who may be demanding a print. But there are some trade-offs. The color range of Polaroid 500 film is not nearly as rich as that of digital prints processed professionally or even made on a good printer using high-quality paper.</p>
        <p>The $800 camera is for home and office use, but Mark Gumz, president of Olympus America, a subsidiary of the Japan-based parent company, Olympus Optical LTD, says it is also well suited for what the electronics industry calls vertical markets -- like insurance and real estate companies, law-enforcement agencies and hospital emergency rooms and other medical markets.</p>
        <p>Patrick Callinan, an analyst at Forrester Research, a Cambridge-based consulting group, said that an expensive hybrid digital-instant camera like the C-211 would most likely remain a niche item.</p>
        <p>I agree. While it is certainly a clever combination, the C-211 appears to be a transitional technology, a camera that will either rapidly evolve into a more streamlined and affordable camera or quickly disappear.</p>
