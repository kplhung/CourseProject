        <p>The carousel of European telecommunications alliances took another turn today, as the Vodafone Group agreed to sell to the Italian national utility, Enel S.p.A., the Italian fixed-line telephone and Internet company that Vodafone inherited as part of its purchase of Mannesmann of Germany.</p>
        <p>Under the deal, valued at 11 billion euros, or $9.63 billion, Enel will pay 5.5 billion euros in cash and the same amount in bonds, for the Italian fixed-line unit, Infostrada. It would also assume 1.1 billion euros of debt.</p>
        <p>Vodafone, the world's biggest operator of wireless phones, said it would use the proceeds to pay back debt amassed in bidding for licenses to operate a new generation of wireless phone systems in Europe.</p>
        <p>Enel, which is majority controlled by the Italian government, has been casting about for fresh revenue sources to offset expected losses caused by the gradual deregulation of energy markets in Europe. It will merge Infostrada with Wind, a fixed-line and Internet company it owns jointly with France Telecom, to compete with the Italian market leader, Telecom Italia. Wind, with 9.1 million fixed-line and wireless phone customers, will be Italy's No. 2, after Telecom Italia, which has 24 million phone customers. And Wind will be Italy's biggest Internet service provider, with 3.4 million clients.</p>
        <p>''The strong synergies between Wind and Infostrada will permit us to get the most out of operating costs and investments, to the advantage of consumers,'' said Tommaso Pompei, chief executive of Wind.</p>
        <p>Chris Gent, chief executive of the London-based Vodafone, said the deal would ''raise considerably more cash, with greater certainty,'' than an initial public offering, an alternative Vodafone considered if the sale to Enel fell through.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that the bond part of the deal would enable Vodafone to avoid the uncertain market for telecommunications stock, providing an additional bonus.</p>
        <p>Still, shares in Vodafone declined 5.8 percent, to 234.5 pence, on the London Stock Exchange, as European communications and Internet shares in general were pulled down in part by the poor market day in the United States. Shares in Enel rose to 4.47 euros, a bit above Wednesday's close.</p>
        <p>European utilities, faced with declining revenue and profit as their markets open to increased competition, are casting about for alternative businesses. Like Enel, many have capitalized on their internal communications networks to enter the phone and Internet businesses.</p>
        <p>Enel's first-half net income fell 14 percent, to 982 million euros, as demand for its electric power dropped. The company said it expected pretax cost benefits of as much as 2.5 billion euros over five years from the Infostrada deal.</p>
        <p>Wind was created three years ago by Enel together with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, but Deutsche Telekom's share was bought out by the two other partners in July. France Telecom's stake in Wind will fall to 26 percent from around 43 percent under today's deal, though the company said it had the option to increase its share later.</p>
        <p>Wind was advised in the deal by Merrill Lynch, and Vodafone by UBS Warburg.</p>
