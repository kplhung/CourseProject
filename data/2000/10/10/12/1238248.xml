        <p>For Vice President Al Gore, the second presidential debate was basically an act of contrition, a sustained and sometimes lightly self-mocking acknowledgment of where he had gone wrong the first time around.</p>
        <p>Almost every boast was qualified, every criticism carefully tempered. After saying that people all around the world admired the United States, Mr. Gore quickly added, ''I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans; it's really true.''</p>
        <p>Before hitting Gov. George W. Bush with statistics that denigrated his record in Texas, he looked and sounded pained and self-effacing, as if he wished he did not have to do this and could only hope he was getting it right.</p>
        <p>Across the table, Mr. Bush was rummaging through a trove of big words. He talked about not letting the American military ''atrophy.'' He expressed concern over any ''abrogation'' of agreements with allies. And he found something ''egregious''  twice in about five minutes.</p>
        <p>He also went through a roll call of Middle Eastern countries, naming ''Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait.'' With geographic chops like these, Mr. Bush seemed to be asking voters, how could anyone doubt his capacity for world leadership? Mr. Bush even mentioned Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former prime minister of Russia, without having to, and managed to pronounce his name correctly.</p>
        <p>For all the serious talk about serious issues, what the candidates engaged in tonight was largely an exercise in image repair and image improvement. Mr. Gore sought a softer, warmer, more truthful touch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush sought an aura of comfort, not distress, with all the complicated information a president must, or at least should, master. Answering questions from the moderator, Jim Lehrer, about foreign policy, Mr. Bush adopted a tone so calm, content and convivial he might have been reminiscing with a grandmother about favorite holiday memories.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's televised odyssey of forensic self-correction was apparent from the first television shot of him: he bore no resemblance to a pumpkin.</p>
        <p>At last week's debate, because of  an unfortunate makeup error, Mr. Gore had sported an orange complexion. But tonight, it was replaced by a more appropriate, life-like hue.</p>
        <p>He knew that he had to recover from damaging charges that in the last debate, he had embellished his resume and distorted facts in the service of self-promotion, and his pursuit of redemption was diligent to the point of being comical -- sometimes intentionally so.</p>
        <p>He appended a statement about the United States being the most powerful nation in world history with the phrase ''that I know about.''  Latching onto an understandably attractive adjective, he three times used the phrase ''honest broker'' to describe the proper role for the United States in Middle Eastern peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>He was obviously eager to shed his reputation in some quarters as a bully, so he repeatedly prefaced efforts to box Mr. Bush into various corners with apologetic caveats like: ''Maybe I heard the previous statements wrong, governor.''</p>
        <p>He was just as obviously intent on not monopolizing the speaking time, so Mr. Gore responded to a suggestion from Mr. Lehrer that another rebuttal yield to a new topic of debate by chirping: ''Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.''</p>
        <p>He even offered a frank, forthright apology for his factual errors from a week ago, complete with an almost hangdog stutter. ''I -- I'm sorry about that,'' Mr. Gore said. ''And I -- I -- I'm going to try to do better.''</p>
        <p>And the sigh master was gone, allowing a different purveyor of awkward nonverbal utterances to emerge. Enter Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seemed to have a cold, and his failure at times to suppress his sniffles and snorts was perhaps an unintended byproduct of what he was trying to accomplish. He clearly wanted to seem so utterly comfortable with the thrust and parry that his demeanor banished any sense among voters that he might be out of his depth. He was also aiming for notes of naturalness that Mr. Gore could only fantasize about.</p>
        <p>As for seriousness, the Texas governor's effort to convey that began when he first sat down. There was a pen and several sheets of paper in front of him, and he conspicuously scribbled faster and longer than Mr. Gore, who was undoubtedly happy to let Mr. Bush one-up him in this department.</p>
        <p>An exchange with Mr. Lehrer toward the end was the clearest indication of Mr. Bush's agenda.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made reference to the initials ''E.I.T.C.,'' prompting a request from Mr. Lehrer that he explain the reference.</p>
        <p>''Earned income tax credit,'' Mr. Bush said, subsequently adding, in a self-satisfied vein: ''A lot of initials for a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it?''</p>
        <p>The candidates' fixation on their own performances was one possible explanation for the placidity of the debate, at least until the last 10 minutes or so.</p>
        <p>Another reason for the relative civility could be their seeming tie in the polls. With neither candidate clearly behind, there was no one with a clear interest in, or compelling justification for, throwing the long ball.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore made little, mincing shows of respect for each other.</p>
        <p>''It seems like we're having a great love-fest tonight,'' Mr. Bush remarked at one point, an assessment with which Mr. Lehrer seemed to agree. He was forced, time and again, to ask the candidates if they might take the time and trouble to specify what their differences were, because they were so often sounding so much alike.</p>
        <p>This was the kind of utterly tame affair in which Mr. Gore, at one juncture, could actually be heard to say: ''I also believe in the golden rule.''</p>
        <p>But there was acid just under the surface, and it occasionally bubbled up. Mr. Gore made a point of referring to the ''Bush-Quayle'' administration, cunningly evoking with that second name a politician, like the Texas governor, who was ridiculed for his verbal unsteadiness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush just so happened to evoke ''Mrs. Clinton,'' circa 1993, when she was pressing a health plan that included more federal control than most Americans wanted. He tied Mr. Gore to her, and the careful viewer could sense the barely suppressed chortle as he did so. Mr. Gore stared back at Mr. Bush icily.</p>
        <p>But he did not respond with a sigh, and he did not lapse into a lecture, and he did not even seize this dastardly claim of Mr. Bush's as an excuse to ask for more speaking time.</p>
        <p>Sitting at the table with Mr. Lehrer tonight were two earnest schoolboys who had read their last report cards, done their homework and learned their lessons, at least for now.</p>
