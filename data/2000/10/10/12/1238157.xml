        <p>Federal agents armed with search warrants yesterday raided the Topeka, Kan., headquarters of the Tax People, a company that has been selling tax-avoidance techniques to middle-class Americans.</p>
        <p>Armed agents of the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Postal Service surrounded the company's two buildings early yesterday morning. Some of the more than 20 armed agents used dollies to remove files and load them into a truck.</p>
        <p>The United States attorney for Kansas, Jackie Williams, who led the raid, said there were no arrests.</p>
        <p>The Tax People has said that it has signed up 50,000 Americans who pay $300 down and $100 a month for advice on how to cut their taxes. A variety of experienced tax professionals say that much of the advice is dubious at best.</p>
        <p>Michael Cooper, 46, the owner of the company, acknowledged last month that his operation was under investigation by Kansas and Missouri authorities. He said those officials wrongly suspected that he was running a pyramid scheme.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper could not be reached yesterday for comment.</p>
        <p>Last night agents were still combing through the company's headquarters and removing files, said Sgt. Kirby Lester, a watch commander with the Topeka Police Department.</p>
        <p>The Tax People system calls for taxpayers to set up a home business to sell the group's ''tax relief'' system to others and then deduct many living costs as business expenses.</p>
