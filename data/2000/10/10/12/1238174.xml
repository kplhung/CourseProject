        <p>Representative Bob Franks said today that Jon S. Corzine, his Democratic opponent in the race for the  Senate, had business dealings with a company that illegally acquired secret America satellite technology for the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks said that in 1996, while Mr. Corzine was the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, he helped underwrite the public offering of Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company Ltd., a company  whose majority owner was a company controlled by the Chinese government. The State Department later found that AsiaSat had illegally acquired secret American military information that eventually helped the Chinese government fix defects in its rocket technology, said Peter DeMarco, Mr. Franks's communications director.</p>

        <p>Representative Bob Franks said today that Jon S. Corzine, his Democratic opponent in the race for the  Senate, had business dealings with a company that illegally acquired secret America satellite technology for the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks said that in 1996, while Mr. Corzine was the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, he helped underwrite the public offering of Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company Ltd., a company  whose majority owner was a company controlled by the Chinese government. The State Department later found that AsiaSat had illegally acquired secret American military information that eventually helped the Chinese government fix defects in its rocket technology, said Peter DeMarco, Mr. Franks's communications director.</p>
        <p>''I think it's fair to ask Mr. Corzine to fully explain the role that he had in helping to bring this company public,'' Mr. Franks said as he made a brief stop at a diner here to greet voters. ''I think it's fair to ask him what he knew and when he knew it concerning the charges that this company has given secret satellite technology that could compromise America's security.''</p>
        <p>Tom Shea, a spokesman for Mr. Corzine, said he was puzzled that Mr. Franks was bringing up an issue in which no one, including the federal government, was accusing Goldman Sachs, and especially Mr. Corzine, of any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>In June, Lockheed Martincoei agreed to pay the federal government $13 million for giving American satellite technology to AsiaSat in 1994, before Goldman Sachs helped AsiaSat go public.</p>
        <p>''I think at a minimum they should make the case that there is something inappropriate about what Mr. Corzine did,'' Mr. Shea said. ''How was Jon Corzine supposed to know about that if the federal government didn't know about it until the year 2000?''</p>
        <p>In a three-page news release about the AsiaSat deal, Mr. DeMarco said  it was fair to judge Mr. Corzine, who has never held public office, on his business dealings over the years.</p>
        <p>''Jon Corzine will surely distance himself from the transfer of military secrets to a company he has a stake in,'' Mr. DeMarco said. ''However, Jon Corzine, on his own Web site, claims credit for creating 720,000 jobs in New Jersey because of the efforts of Goldman Sachs. If he wants to take credit for things that Goldman may have done, he must bear responsibility for putting the profits of Goldman ahead of the interests of the United States.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea said that while Mr. Corzine did profit from the public offering, he did not invest in it. The company was bought and sold just for the purposes of the public offering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea said the Franks campaign was bringing up a non-issue because Mr. Franks was far behind in fund-raising and in the polls, which show him trailing Mr. Corzine by at least 14 percentage points.</p>
        <p>''It's an indication of their desperation,'' he said. ''They have no message and they have no money. They're desperately casting about for an issue.''</p>
        <p>The two candidates will meet for their second debate on Thursday, in a forum sponsored by NJN and The New York Times.</p>
