        <p>''Please forgive me,'' Gary Winnick said, ushering a guest into his office last Thursday afternoon. ''I'm a little distracted today.''</p>
        <p>Distracted indeed. Asia Global Crossing, a subsidiary of the telecommunications concern Global Crossing Holdings that Mr. Winnick co-founded more than three years ago, was expected to sell stock to the public that day. But that morning, as investors continued to bail out of technology stocks, several money managers had balked at the $9 to $11 a share that was being asked for Asia Global.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to hear any whining from the bankers,'' Mr. Winnick snapped at a colleague who popped in to give him an update. Both Salomon Smith Barney and the Goldman Sachs Group had been asked to buy as many as 14 million shares of Asia Global to support the deal, an extraordinary request they could have refused, but did not. Mr. Winnick watched as the deal was done, although he had to settle for $7 a share.</p>
        <p>Just four years ago, this relative newcomer to the billionaires' club -- his stake in Global Crossing is now worth about $2.5 billion, down from a peak of more than $6 billion -- could never have demanded such support from two of Wall Street's most respected firms. ''But when you make several billion dollars the world's perception of you changes,'' said Nelson Peltz, a New York financier who has known Mr. Winnick since the early 1980's, when he was a young salesman at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the infamous investment firm, now defunct, that specialized in junk bonds. ''You go from being an ordinary bloke to a guy who is infallible.'' Of course, Mr. Peltz added, neither image is true.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winnick, 52, is a former furniture business manager from Roslyn, N.Y., who remade himself not once, but twice in his career. First he turned himself into a successful Wall Street sales executive at Drexel under the tutelage of Michael R. Milken before Mr. Milken's empire collapsed. Now he is known as the telecommunications financier behind Global Crossing, an undersea cable operator that is building a worldwide network to transmit information via the Internet.</p>
        <p>And as far as Global Crossing investors are concerned, Mr. Winnick may need to remake himself all over again. Global Crossing's stock price -- down 65 percent from a high of $61.81 -- has taken a beating along with other telecommunications stocks as investors worry whether companies in the industry can deliver on the growth prospects they have promised. It closed today at $21.44, down $2.44.</p>
        <p>One problem Global Crossing had early on, analysts said, was that it had plenty of deal makers, but not enough executives with real operating experience. The departure of Leo Hindery Jr. as chief executive after only seven months in the job -- the third to leave in Global Crossing's short history -- suggests that the company is still having difficulty putting together its operating team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winnick said that the company had pulled together the talent to address the problem and that Global Crossing had met every objective it had set for itself so far.</p>
        <p>But he is all too aware that if Global Crossing slips up, he, too, may drop out of the spotlight. ''I know I can go back to anonymity in a quick minute,'' he said. ''It doesn't take much to fall off a rock.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Winnick, for all his protestations, clearly enjoys the spotlight.</p>
        <p>A fixture now on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans, Mr. Winnick relishes the attention his wealth has brought him, dropping names of famous people he has met, including the Queen Mother of Britain, whose 100th-birthday party he attended. And he has taken on a more public persona as a philanthropist, most recently pledging $40 million to the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation to help build a Museum of Tolerance in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Not that he has forgotten where he came from. Mr. Winnick, for example, was married at the Swan Club, a catering hall near Roslyn, on Christmas Eve 1972, in part, he recalled, because he knew it would be decked out in tinsel and Christmas trees. Never mind that he is Jewish. ''I saved money on the decorations,'' he said, a sly grin crossing his face. ''That way I could serve the guests lobster or steak.''</p>
        <p>Today, what makes Mr. Winnick stand out, even in a city where success is often measured by how conspicuously you spend, is how quickly and fabulously wealthy he has become with Global Crossing. ''Gary is extremely respected,'' said Alex Yemenidjian, chairman and chief executive of MGM Inc. ''One, because he's rich. Two, because he got rich faster than others here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Winnick moved to Los Angeles in 1978 to sell high-yield bonds for Drexel, after spending six years on Wall Street. At Drexel, he has told friends, he made as much as $2 million a month, but left the firm in 1985 to start his own investment fund. In 1991, he formed a merchant bank, Pacific Capital Group. For years he made a very comfortable but unglamorous living investing in real estate, industrial companies and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Then along came the Internet. In December 1996, David Lee, an executive Mr. Winnick had hired in 1989, pitched an outlandish idea: build a fiber optic cable along the ocean floor to handle the burgeoning traffic over the Internet. It was not hard for Mr. Winnick to pull together the financing, including $15 million of his own money, throwing in an extra $5 million for his partners.</p>
        <p>''Gary was never more than two degrees of separation from anyone we wanted to get to know,'' said Barry Porter, a co-founder of Global Crossing, who, along with Mr. Lee, recently left the company to set up a venture capital firm.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Winnick is a master networker, amassing a Rolodex so fat he can call on just about anyone for help -- politicians, business executives, even socialites. To make sure Global's interests are on every legislators' agenda, for instance, Mr. Winnick and his associates are generous political donors -- well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars -- something they do not apologize for.</p>
        <p>''As long as it's legal we're going to be a player,'' said Lodwrick Cook, who runs legislative affairs for Global Crossing.</p>
        <p>But working for Mr. Winnick can be, in a word, tense. He is at times gruff, barking orders from his third-floor office with all the gusto of the Wall Street salesman he used to be. He holds late-night meetings while he works out on a treadmill. And he is not afraid to clash with employees if he believes it is necessary to force better decision making.</p>
        <p>''It's always a complex relationship with Gary,'' said Abbott Brown, a friend since 1994 who recently left Global Crossing. ''Love-hate? Maybe. Every transaction has some dark days.'' He recalled a meeting in 1997 when Mr. Winnick was pitching an idea Mr. Brown thought held little promise. ''I made a comment to him like, 'That's a dumb idea,' '' he said. Mr. Winnick shot back angrily. ''I've listened to a lot of your dumb ideas,'' Mr. Brown said Mr. Winnick told him. ''Now you have to listen to mine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Winnick winced when reminded of the incident. ''To understand that you had to grow up in my house,'' he said. Mr. Winnick, who was born in 1947, grew up the youngest of three children. His father, Arnold, struggled as the owner of a restaurant supply business, he said, before the business went bankrupt in the 1960's. His mother, Blanche, was a homemaker and interior decorator. He and his siblings worked out their differences both loudly and openly, he said, but always with respect.</p>
        <p>Casey Cogut, a prominent Manhattan lawyer who was a childhood classmate, said Mr. Winnick ''had this cute freckled face and you knew he could get away with murder.'' The two smoked cigarettes at Mr. Cogut's bar mitzvah, captured in a photograph that Mr. Winnick still keeps. And in Roslyn High School's 1965 yearbook, he was dubbed ''1/4 Hawaii'' because he and his three closest friends used to spend hours listening to the Beach Boys.</p>
        <p>His father died when Mr. Winnick was 18 years old. ''1966. March 3. 9:30 p.m.,'' Mr. Winnick said. ''Two hours after dinner he had a heart attack. He went to his Thursday night card game. I got the call.'' Mr. Winnick then held up his right hand to show a diamond-and-ruby wedding band. ''My mother handed me his ring that night and I've worn it ever since.''</p>
        <p>With it came a sense of responsibility for his mother and his future family. Instead of going away to college, he commuted to nearby C. W. Post, graduating in 1969 with a degree in economics. When his mother got ovarian cancer in 1987, he said he moved her to Los Angeles for treatment.</p>
        <p>There are few things Mr. Winnick will not discuss. One of them is his experience at Drexel. He was long gone before Drexel filed for bankruptcy in 1990 and Mr. Milken, who masterminded the junk-bond unit, pleaded guilty to violating securities laws and served time in prison. But tensions were running high in the Los Angeles office then. And of particular concern to those there, said several people who worked at Drexel then, were whether or not exiles like Mr. Winnick were cooperating to regulators.</p>
        <p>''People were circling the wagons,'' one former Drexel employee said. ''It was us against them.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Winnick would not comment, except to say, ''I think we come through those experiences, and we all have our scars.''</p>
        <p>Besides, he said, no one experience defines a lifetime. ''I think it is too early to write the script,'' he said. ''In terms of my legacy, I just hope I'm not judged to be a jerk.''</p>
