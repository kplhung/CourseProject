        <p>The Senate enacted legislation today that would allow victims of terrorism to collect court-awarded damages from countries that sponsor terrorist activity. The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the House last week, goes to the president who is expected to sign it into law.</p>
        <p>In a bipartisan effort, the Senate passed the measure 95 to 0.</p>
        <p>Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, a co-sponsor of the bill, said it would ''strengthen our stand against terrorism'' by acting as a deterrent to attacks aimed at American citizens.</p>
        <p>Under exisiting law, the president can block efforts by American victims of terrorism to collect damages from foreign countries. The new measure does not give the president that option.</p>
        <p>For a suit to succeed in courts here, the State Department must list the country as a sponsor of terrorism. Iran, for example, has been on the list since 1984.</p>
        <p>Congress passed a measure in October 1998 that called for the State Department and the Treasury Department to assist victims of terrorism to locate money for judgments. But the legislation contained a waiver that permitted the president to decline support in the interest of national security.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have voiced concern that the sanctity of American diplomatic property abroad, a right extended to all diplomatic missions under international law, might be compromised if private citizens here were allowed to seize foreign government property.</p>
        <p>Terry Anderson, a former correspondent for The Associated Press who was held hostage in Lebanon in the 1980's, and his family were awarded more than $300 million in damages from Iran in March.</p>
        <p>In March 1998, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $247.5 million to the family of Alisa M. Flatow, of West Orange, N.J., who was studying at a seminary in Jerusalem in 1995 when she was killed in a suicide bus attack for which Islamic Holy War, with ties to Iran, claimed responsibility. And in August 1998, a federal court ordered Iran to pay $65 million in damages for its role in the kidnapping of Joseph J. Cicippio, Frank H. Reed and David P. Jacobsen, three Americans held with Mr. Anderson.</p>
        <p>Thus far, they have been unable to collect on the settlements.</p>
