        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The first thing that I noticed about the article about computer technology in schools was the perhaps unintentional fact that the photographs gave the impression that all technologically advanced and completely wired schools are schools for white children.</p>
        <p>There was not a single member of a minority in the photographs. This sends a bad message to America, and it reiterates the need for federal funding for certain elements of education. When the local area is wealthy, then the schools are well financed. You do not see wired schools in the poorest sections of Manhattan and laptops on every student's lap.</p>
