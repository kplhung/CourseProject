        <p>Two Americans won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday for work that has helped to explain complex behavior, like why some working mothers make more than those with fewer children and why one route is favored for a new highway over another.</p>
        <p>The award of 9 million Swedish kronor -- $910,000 -- will be split by James J. Heckman, 56, at the University of Chicago, and Daniel L. McFadden, 63, at the University of California at Berkeley. Nine professors from the University of Chicago have won the prize, more than any other university, since 1969, when the Royal Swedish Academy in Stockholm first gave a prize in economics, adding it to the Nobel Prizes that have been awarded for outstanding work in other fields.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heckman, whose techniques are now standard practice in studies of the links between, say, job training and wages or a woman's wages and her family situation, had often been mentioned as a potential Nobel winner. Mr. McFadden, whose contribution has been less publicized, was on no one's list, although like Mr. Heckman he had won a prestigious Clarke Medal, which is awarded each year to an outstanding economist younger than 40.</p>
        <p>Before yesterday's announcement, the favorites for the Nobel this year included Joseph E. Stiglitz at Stanford and George A. Akerlof at Berkeley, known for their path-breaking economic theory. But the Royal Academy swings between contributions to theory and methodology, and this turned out to be a year for methodology.</p>
        <p>''Each of the laureates,'' the academy said of Mr. Heckman and Mr. McFadden, had developed methods ''that are widely used in the statistical analysis of individual and household behavior.'' The formal award is the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heckman was in Rio de Janeiro to speak at a conference when his wife, Lynne, received the call in Chicago at 4 a.m. yesterday. ''It was a Swedish voice, but he would not say why he was calling; he asked for Jim's phone number,'' she said. Soon after, Mr. Heckman called home with the news.</p>
        <p>''I feel relieved to get a Nobel,'' Mr. Heckman said, speaking by telephone to reporters gathered for a news conference in Chicago. ''I remember some reporter called me and asked, 'How does it feel to be at Chicago without a Nobel Prize?' After a while it starts to hurt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McFadden in Berkeley got the call from Sweden even earlier. ''I was dead asleep,'' he said. ''My wife grasped what was happening before I did, and she was jumping up and down while I was still trying to figure out what was going on.'' Later, he told a television interviewer that he thought his chances of winning were ''one in a million.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Heckman, in effect, has forced the economics profession to doubt findings once taken for granted. A survey, for instance, might find that two people from the same neighborhood, with the same high school education and similar backgrounds were offered job training. One took it and one did not, and the one who took the training then went on to earn a higher wage. The survey concluded that job training lifted wages.</p>
        <p>Not necessarily so, said Mr. Heckman, who began to raise this sort of challenge soon after he joined the Chicago faculty in 1972, a year after earning a doctorate at Princeton. Motivation must also be factored in, he said. The one who went through job training and earned more might have been more ambitious and for that reason would have earned more without the job training.</p>
        <p>Similarly, among women in the work force, a mother of three or four earned more than mothers with fewer children, studies found. That was puzzling. ''Common sense said that employers did not care how many children an employee had,'' said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Heckman, however, added nonworking women to the database and found that women with three or four children insisted on good pay before they would take a job.</p>
        <p>The statistical equations that Mr. Heckman developed to meld the workers and nonworkers -- thus correcting for ''selection bias'' and more accurately calculating the probability of going to work -- won him the Nobel. His findings are sometimes challenged, but not his insistence on all the variables that can arise. ''He gets infinite credit,'' said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard University labor economist, ''for pointing out how many inferences used by economists were flawed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Heckman and Mr. McFadden are longtime friends who often exchange ideas but have never done joint research, although their findings and techniques are roughly related. ''We are both in the business of inventing statistical tools that are appropriate to economic applications,'' Mr. McFadden said.</p>
        <p>He was trained at the University of Minnesota in the 1950's and early 1960's, first in physics and then in economics, mainly because his interest in psychology drew him to professors in the economics department who emphasized psychology. In 1964, a year after arriving at Berkeley, a graduate student asked him for help in analyzing how the California Department of Transportation decided on routes for new highways.</p>
        <p>''I worked out a model for her to use,'' he said. And that became a prototype of the statistical models that eventually won him the Nobel. The model quantified how public opinion polls and political pressure, for example, affected the choice of one route over other possible routes.</p>
        <p>The model soon turned out to have other uses. Using the model, he has estimated, for example, what would prompt people to shift to cars powered by electric batteries rather than gasoline. ''We found that substantial subsidies would be required,'' he said. ''Nongasoline vehicles are fairly inconvenient and rather expensive, and that is rather discouraging for people.''</p>
