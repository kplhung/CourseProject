        <p>A teenager covered with 18 tattoos, including swastikas and white supremacist symbols, has confessed that he left his Queens home before 5 on a Sunday morning and traveled 50 miles to a Long Island town to attack two day laborers because they were Mexican, the police said today.</p>
        <p>The teenager, Ryan Wagner, a 19-year-old construction worker who lives with his parents in Maspeth, was arraigned today in Islip on two counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated harassment in the Sept. 17 attack, in which the police say he used a knife.

        <p>A teenager covered with 18 tattoos, including swastikas and white supremacist symbols, has confessed that he left his Queens home before 5 on a Sunday morning and traveled 50 miles to a Long Island town to attack two day laborers because they were Mexican, the police said today.</p>
        <p>The teenager, Ryan Wagner, a 19-year-old construction worker who lives with his parents in Maspeth, was arraigned today in Islip on two counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated harassment in the Sept. 17 attack, in which the police say he used a knife. He was held without bail at the Suffolk County jail in Riverhead.</p>
        <p>The two laborers said that two white men, posing as contractors promising work, had picked them up in a car in Farmingville and driven them to an abandoned factory in Shirley, where they were attacked but managed to escape.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk police are still looking for the other suspect, a 28-year-old construction worker who they said was last known to be staying with friends in Holbrook. The police said the man, whom they would not identify, had done work for a construction company near the building where the laborers were attacked.</p>
        <p>A grand jury will be convened on Thursday to hear the case against Mr. Wagner, said the Suffolk district attorney, James M. Catterson Jr. If convicted, Mr. Wagner faces up to 50 years in prison.</p>
        <p>In a confession on Tuesday, the police said, Mr. Wagner said he was simply doing what the other suspect wanted him to do.</p>
        <p>''What we gather from his confession was, the motive was in fact to go out and attack Mexicans,'' said Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks, commanding officer of the bias crimes unit. ''We cannot say they are tied to any organization, or they were hired by anybody, or they were prompted to do this by any particular group.''</p>
        <p>Sergeant Reecks said Mr. Wagner did not mention any other motives, like resentment over the day laborers' effect on the community. Some Farmingville residents have been troubled by the presence of day laborers waiting for work at a busy intersection, and a group there has pushed for government action to curtail the number of illegal immigrants in the area.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Wagner indicated that he has ventured into various Web sites having to do with white supremacists, but there is no indication that he is a member of any organizations,'' the sergeant said.</p>
        <p>Asked today whether the police were looking for any suspects other than the second attacker, he said, ''We certainly have not closed the door on other possibilities.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference here this morning, Mr. Catterson said the other suspect ''went into the wind.'' The police described that man as a friend of Mr. Wagner's who also has multiple tattoos and white supremacist views. Mr. Wagner said the two had  met in a bar in Little Neck and gone fishing together, Sergeant Reecks said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Catterson said the authorities knew the suspects' names early in the investigation. The police say an anonymous tipster told them that Mr. Wagner was bragging about the attack.</p>
        <p>The police searched the Wagner home on Oct. 1 after towing away the car used in the attack, a Ford Taurus, Sergeant Reecks said. The same day, he said, the police searched the house where the other suspect was staying with friends. That suspect had recently lived in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. ''He kind of bounces around,'' Sergeant Reecks said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner told the police that after the car was towed, he hid at an aunt's house a few blocks from his home, Sergeant Reecks said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner's lawyer, Thomas F. Liotti, got in touch with the district attorney last Friday, and Mr. Wagner turned himself in on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Wagner was very quiet and calm as he confessed. In his statement, Mr. Wagner said that after the laborers escaped, he and the other suspect left the abandoned building for Holbrook, and returned with a van to retrieve their tools. The sergeant said, ''They didn't want to be identified in the car they were in.''</p>
        <p>At Mr. Wagner's house, people inside would not speak to reporters today. But neighbors said he had attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic high school in Flushing, for two years, then left and later earned an equivalency diploma.</p>
        <p>In a statement released by his lawyer, Mr. Wagner, who has no criminal record, said he had a drinking problem. ''I do not hate anyone,'' he said. ''I have an alcohol problem, which causes me to become angry. I now understand it is an illness that is treatable. I recognize that I sometimes have an impulse control disorder, which is worsened by the use of alcohol. I deeply regret that the hurt and harm that this has caused to all concerned.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 14, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about the arrest of a Maspeth, Queens, man on charges that he attacked two Mexican day laborers on Long Island included an erroneous report from neighbors about the suspect's school history and misstated a school's address. Christ the King, a Roman Catholic high school, is in Middle Village, not Flushing. It said it had no record of the suspect, Ryan Wagner, 19.</p>
