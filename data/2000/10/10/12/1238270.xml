        <p>Denny Neagle did not win Game 1 for the Yankees, but he did pitch well enough to give the Yankees a chance to win, and that means he will probably start Game 5.</p>
        <p>''He pitched well enough to be considered seriously for that spot,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. ''I think he proved last night that if you keep the ball down and change speeds, you'll be O.K.''</p>
        <p>Neagle pitched poorly in his last three starts of the regular season. When Torre picked him to start Game 1 of this series, he had no sense of how Neagle would react. But the left-hander overcame some early nerves, developed a rhythm and pitched deep into the game.</p>
        <p>Torre will have the option of starting Orlando Hernandez on three days' rest in Game 5, but keeping Neagle in line to pitch Game 5 will allow Torre to provide full rest for the projected Game 6 and Game 7 starters, Hernandez and Andy Pettitte. Roger Clemens and Pettitte pitched with three days' rest against Oakland in the division series; both were knocked around.</p>
