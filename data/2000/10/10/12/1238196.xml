        <p>President Clinton did not seem to be conducting budget negotiations today as he traipsed through Pennsylvania raising campaign money for House Democrats.</p>
        <p>But he was.</p>
        <p>Every moment that passed  strengthened his hand in dealing with Republicans in the end-of-the-year appropriations struggle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton gained an advantage as he strode to the podium at the convention center in Pittsburgh to campaign for the Senate candidacy of Representative Ron Klink. He benefited, as well, hours later when he addressed Democratic donors in a hotel ballroom in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The dynamic is simple: While Republican congressional leaders are eager to adjourn for the year so members can campaign, the president has all the time in the world, at least until he must leave office on Jan. 20, 2001. As a result, the strategy goes, the more pressure Congress feels to leave town, the more likely it is that Mr. Clinton gets the concessions he wants.</p>
        <p>He recently explained the strategy this way: ''If the Democrats stick with me even though we're in the minority, we get a lot of what we want, otherwise nobody gets to go home. So we work all year long just to sort of keep our heads above water waiting for the last three weeks, and then we all sit there like calm Buddhas waiting for the results to come in. So watch it and see if we can pull it off one more time.''</p>
        <p>Presidential aides are confident they can do that. Before heading out on the campaign trail today, Mr. Clinton signed just the third of 13 appropriations bills that must reach his desk before Congress adjourns -- the bill financing the Department of the Interior and related agencies. But he did so only after his negotiators had extracted key concessions.</p>
        <p>The bill contained the first aid increase for the National Endowment for the Arts since Congress proposed eliminating it in 1995. It did not contain various riders that Mr. Clinton saw as anti-environment.</p>
        <p>''You can't get cocky before you've won,'' a senior administration official said, sounding just a hair short of cocky. ''But the Congress is interested in when, and we're interested in what. When it's all told, there will be more Clinton priorities scattered throughout the final appropriation bills than ever. They're caving more quickly and more quietly than usual.''</p>
        <p>The budget fight will not give Mr. Clinton all he wants, of course. Republicans are resisting White House education proposals and have slashed away at administration proposals in a host of other areas. Mr. Clinton has vetoed the energy and water bill and will sign the bill financing the Department of Agriculture despite provisions he opposes.</p>
        <p>Winning the budget battle, though, is not only about policy. It is also about outflanking the opposition in the public relations battle. In that, Mr. Clinton has excelled through steady attacks on the Republicans for not doing enough one moment, for acting recklessly the next or, alternatively, for focusing too much on the worries of the rich.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Clinton joined hundreds of Americorps volunteers in Philadelphia to expound on the service program's importance. He publicized a letter from 49 governors, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, backing it.</p>
        <p>Even as the president spoke, negotiators on Capitol Hill were nearing a deal to restore much of the Americorps aid the president had sought, overruling the House's attempt to eliminate the money.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Clinton is relevant at all in this budget process surprises some.</p>
        <p>''This guy is a lame duck who in the last weeks and months of his presidency is not supposed to have much say,'' said Stanley Collender, managing director of the federal budget consulting group at Fleischman-Hillard. ''But the president is in as good a position as he's ever been in as far as the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>Republicans acknowledge that the White House has maneuvered adeptly in the years since House Republicans gambled, and lost, in allowing the federal government to close.</p>
        <p>''Are Republicans frustrated that he has one voice and we have 535 cats to herd? Sure, it's frustrating,'' said John S. Czwartacki, spokesman for Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.</p>
