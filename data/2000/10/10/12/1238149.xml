        <p>President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia said today that he was having ''almost as much trouble from my friends as from my enemies'' in the transition from the rule of Slobodan Milosevic and that he was concerned that his own authority was being compromised.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kostunica expressed confidence that Mr. Milosevic's allies could not stage a comeback, even though they appear to be trying, and that difficulties in negotiating a transitional government for Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, would be resolved.</p>
        <p>He said that he looked forward to his first meeting, on Thursday, with President Clinton's Balkan adviser, James C. O'Brien, and other senior American officials and that he was  eager to begin a new, more balanced relationship with Washington, including a rapid re-establishment of diplomatic relations broken with the NATO bombing war last year.</p>
        <p>''The United States has done too much meddling in our internal affairs,'' Mr. Kostunica said in an interview. ''Now it's meddling less than usual, so this will have a positive influence.'' If re-establishing diplomatic relations is in his competence as federal president, he said, he will do it quickly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica spoke in the offices of the federal president in the Palace of Federations as a small number of aides rushed in and out amid a cacophony of telephones, both land lines and cell phones.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Kostunica said that some members of the 18-party coalition that supported his presidential candidacy were making policy statements that had not been cleared with him and were using extra-legal procedures to take control of certain ministries and companies that have been run by those close to Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>''I cannot justify all that's going on,'' he said. ''On the surface there is a peaceful, democratic transition, but below the surface is a kind of volcano, not so controlled.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica spoke as a leading member of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party, Branislav Ivkovic, said that the current Serbian government would not resign and that the current prime minister had also taken the job of interior minister, which controls the police.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kostunica said he was confident that early elections for a new Serbian Parliament would take place, as agreed, on Dec. 17. While some parties in the Parliament ''are fighting for seats'' in a temporary government until those elections, ''others are fighting to overturn the outcome'' of the popular will, he said. But they would not succeed.</p>
        <p>Another Kostunica ally with ties to the old regime, Dusan Mihajlovic, warned that Mr. Milosevic had begun to organize his allies to create difficulties and even chaos, including lifting some price controls, that could be blamed on Mr. Kostunica and his team. ''We have information that Milosevic is pulling the strings,'' Mr. Mihajlovic said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica has said that he does not recognize the legitimacy of the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague and would be against handing Mr. Milosevic over.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Kostunica's allies, worried that Mr. Milosevic is creating difficulties for the new order, are speaking openly of putting him on trial in Serbia. In Washington, administration officials repeated today that the United States would not press for Mr. Milosevic's extradition right now. Some administration officials believe a trial within Serbia would be the next best thing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's allies are talking about a domestic trial of Mr. Milosevic, perhaps on charges of election fraud, to get him out of political life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica expressed concern that some of his own allies in the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, or DOS as the coalition is known, were providing ammunition for the complaints of chaos and illegality made by the Socialists and Serbian Radicals. ''Some members of DOS are not so much eating away at my authority -- that they cannot do,'' Mr. Kostunica said. ''The problem is that they are compromising that authority.''</p>
        <p>In particular, he and his aides said, the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, who leads the strongest party by far in the coalition, is trying  to consolidate the popular revolt against Mr. Milosevic, but in a way that has sometimes caused anger.</p>
        <p>The best-known example was Mr. Djindjic's effort to put an ally, a well-known businessman, in charge of the Customs office after ousting the old minister. The appointment of Mr. Djindjic's ally caused an uproar among other political leaders and it was rescinded in a day.</p>
        <p>In companies, banks, institutes and universities, Milosevic managers are being ousted, usually by workers tired of political bosses.</p>
        <p>''Some of this is spontaneous, some of it is not,'' Mr. Kostunica said. ''Some of it is comes from within, and some from the outside. And some of these actions are from people who are in connection with or appear on behalf of DOS or even myself, which is not true. But all together, it's something that worries me.''</p>
        <p>He said that the image of crime and chaos, part of any transition, was harmful. ''But we'll settle all this among ourselves,'' he said. ''But if it's an excuse for any foreign intervention, that would be the problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Djindjic has also made announcements that Mr. Kostunica has not approved. For example, Mr. Djindjic said that the Yugoslav Army chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, would be fired. Mr. Kostunica, who met with the army command today, said he had no intention of firing General Pavkovic -- at least for now. The general became a popular hero for his efforts to defend Kosovo. Mr. Kostunica also has no interest now in stirring up a quiescent army while he and his allies try to ensure they control the Serbian police.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica and his allies obtained the resignation of the Serbian interior minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, who ordered the police to attack protesters. But they have not succeeded yet in winning the job for themselves. Mr. Djindjic thinks it is crucial to protect the revolution, and tonight he offered joint control over four key ministries: Interior, Justice, Finance and Information.</p>
        <p>But if the other parties do not agree to a new transitional government by the end of the week, Mr. Djindjic warned, the opposition will  call thousands of people into the streets. Again, Mr. Kostunica seems less than enthusiastic over revolutionary tactics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ivkovic's statement to Radio B-92 was a form of challenge. ''The Serbian government will go on ruling the republic since it was elected on a four-year mandate and it is the only body that can make legal decisions,'' he said. Another Serbian government statement, read on YU-Info, a television station close to Mr. Milosevic, accused the opposition of ''fomenting violence and lawlessness'' and taking over companies and ministries illegally. It urged the police to act and said control of television should be returned to its owners in the state and city.</p>
        <p>But the police did not respond. And Mr. Djindjic said: ''That government can declare itself not only legal but omnipotent but it's a fact of life they have no control over 80 percent of the processes in the country. We are tired of haggling and manipulations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica and his staff also bridled at another Djindjic announcement that usurped federal presidential powers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djindjic said that Miroljub Labus, an economist, would become provisional prime minister of Yugoslavia. But Mr. Kostunica said today that he would choose a prime minister from Montenegro, as the Constitution required, who would be a member of the Socialist People's Party. The party won nearly all the seats in Montenegro because of an election boycott by the republic's president, Milo Djukanovic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica will travel to Montenegro on Friday to meet the local party leaders and Mr. Djukanovic. They will discuss a new federal government and begin to talk about a new, more equal relationship between Serbia and tiny Montenegro within Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica said today that he was not wedded to the name Yugoslavia, especially after all the wars of secession, and once favored ''The Union of Serbia and Montenegro.''</p>
        <p>''The question is not the name but what sort of state we want,'' he said. ''If the ties are too loose, we lose the sense of unity.''</p>
