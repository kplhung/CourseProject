        <p>Orlando Hernandez was asked last night through a translator how he planned to celebrate his birthday, and a smile tickled the corner of his mouth like a leftover dab of frosting. He said there would be a party late last night on the Yankees' long flight to Seattle, and it sounded as if that would be plenty for him.</p>
        <p>El Duque, who turned either 31 (according to the Yankees) or 35 (according to other documentation) yesterday, had already given his teammates and a city aching for a Subway Series a better gift than any he could have received. With another superb postseason pitching performance, Hernandez had given the Yankees their hope back.</p>
        <p>''When he takes the mound,'' right fielder Paul O'Neill said, shaking his head almost in disbelief, ''you feel like you're going to win.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees have not done anything but win when Hernandez pitches in the postseason. He allowed the Seattle Mariners only one run and six hits in eight innings yesterday, and the Yankees ended their offensive stupor with seven runs in the bottom of the eighth for a stunning 7-1 victory. The American League Championship Series is now tied at one victory apiece.</p>
        <p>''He does this time and time again,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said, ''and I know you're not surprised at it, but you still marvel at it.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez is 7-0 in the postseason in his three-year major league career. He is the first Yankee to do that, and the first major leaguer to do that since Orel Hershiser, who needed 11 years to win his first seven postseason games. Hernandez has allowed only eight earned runs in 59 1/3 postseason innings.</p>
        <p>''I believe I'm going to do my job and hold the other team, and our hitters are going to go out there and score some runs,'' Hernandez said.</p>
        <p>He gave up a run in the third inning after first baseman Tino Martinez mishandled his pickoff throw. Mike Cameron, who had walked, stole second and scored on Stan Javier's single. ''I saw it,'' Martinez said. ''He didn't fire it over there. He just eased it over, and I felt I had to rush'' the tag.</p>
        <p>That was El Duque's only lob of the afternoon. He kept the Yankees in the game until they solved a Seattle relief corps that had not given up a run in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''I'm thinking, 'We've got to score some runs for this guy,' '' second baseman Luis Sojo said.</p>
        <p>It only seems as if Hernandez has been rescuing the Yankees forever. Actually, his first postseason victory came on Oct. 10, 1998.</p>
        <p>The Yankees trailed Cleveland in the A.L.C.S., two games to one. Hernandez pitched seven shutout innings on the road, allowing three hits, and the Yankees got even. That victory was also the start of a seven-game winning streak that ended with the Yankees winning the World Series.</p>
        <p>Hernandez threw 130 pitches last Friday to beat Oakland in Game 3 of their division series. He recorded an eighth-inning out in the decisive Game 5.</p>
        <p>Hernandez struggled this year -- he had a 12-13 record, which included a four-game losing streak -- but he has remained perfect in the postseason. Although he insisted again that he prepared for every game the same, his fastball has a little extra sizzle.</p>
        <p>''There's always pressure,'' he said, chewing his gum hard and shrugging. ''We're all human. You just have to know how to deal with it, battle and do your job.''</p>
        <p>Part of his job, apparently, is to be a cheerleader. When the Yankees were batting around in the eighth, the television cameras caught him in the dugout, hollering along with everyone else.</p>
        <p>''They had a few chances to put us away,'' Martinez said, ''and El Duque kept them in check.''</p>
        <p>Torre was particularly impressed with what happened after the bottom of the first. After Hernandez opened the game by striking out the side, the Yankees loaded the bases, and those who had made it to Yankee Stadium were on their feet.</p>
        <p>But Bernie Williams slapped a grounder that died a foot in front of home plate, and the Mariners turned it into a double play. Torre said afterward that it was as if the air had been let out of a balloon.</p>
        <p>''A lot of pitchers would have got frustrated in that situation and given up a couple,'' O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>El Duque gave up only one. After the third inning, Seattle put only five runners on base. He retired the side in each of his last two innings. The Yankees then got back in the series.</p>
        <p>''You look at it, you scratch your head and you're frustrated,'' Torre said. ''But it was huge for El Duque to go out and do what he did.''</p>
