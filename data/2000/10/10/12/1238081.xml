      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Compared with the firestorm that engulfed the stock offering of PetroChina last April, the impending sale of shares in China's second-largest oil company, Sinopec, has generated barely any smoke.</p>
        <p>But as the Chinese government prepares to set a price for the initial public offering here on Thursday, Sinopec has been jolted by an 11th-hour disclosure that one of its subsidiaries has invested in Sudan.</p>
        <p>The subsidiary, Zhongyuan Petroleum, had a joint venture with China National Petroleum, the parent of PetroChina, to conduct surveys and drill oil wells in Sudan. The venture, reported in The Asian Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, was transferred to China National Petroleum in June.</p>
        <p>It was another, far larger project in Sudan backed by China National Petroleum that led human rights and labor groups to organize a bitter campaign against PetroChina's offering. They said the company abetted a regime that a United Nations report had accused of genocide.</p>
        <p>The critics have left Sinopec in peace, which may reflect the waning of China as a political hotbed now that the United States has granted Beijing normal trade status. Also, based on its sales pitch, Sinopec is a cleaner version of PetroChina.</p>
        <p>Sinopec's prospectus makes no mention of Sudan because the venture was ''immaterial and irrelevant,'' said an executive with ties to the company. ''It was never part of the listed company; it was a minuscule part of the parent company, and it is history,'' the executive said.</p>
        <p>Several portfolio managers agreed that Sinopec's past link to Sudan would have little effect on the global stock offering, which seeks to raise $3.5 billion. The company's shares begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange next Wednesday and in Hong Kong and London the next day.</p>
        <p>But the disclosure underscores how even a comparatively open Chinese state-owned company can be a Pandora's box.</p>
        <p>''The problem with all Chinese I.P.O.'s is that you're buying a box, and you don't quite know what's in it,'' said Alan Troner, president of Asia Pacific Energy Consulting, based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
        <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said it was concerned by the Sinopec-Sudan link. But Brandon Rees, a researcher in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s investment office, said it would not campaign against every Chinese offering. ''We haven't done a counter roadshow against Sinopec because we think we already made an impact with PetroChina,'' Mr. Rees said.</p>
        <p>Analysts said Sinopec, China's largest refiner and distributor of petroleum, had fewer troubling entanglements than China National Petroleum, which has operations in Tibet in addition to Sudan. Still, in Beijing's pell-mell restructuring of corporate China, most companies end up owning some unpalatable assets.</p>
        <p>Zhongyuan Petroleum is one of 60 subsidiaries of the Sinopec Group, a sprawling state empire formed in 1983. Sinopec inherited Zhongyuan -- and the Sudan venture -- as part of a complex swap of assets with China National Petroleum in 1998.</p>
        <p>Executives close to Sinopec said it was well aware of the implications of ties to Sudan. They said it decided to dispose of the venture before entering the marketplace.</p>
        <p>Yet Sinopec has not severed its ties completely. Zhongyuan still maintains an office dedicated to the Sudan venture at its headquarters in Henan province. Its purpose, one executive said, is to provide residual services after the transfer of its Sudan employees to China National Petroleum.</p>
        <p>Sinopec has issued no statements about Sudan. The company did not return a telephone call today.</p>
        <p>In deciding whether to buy Sinopec's stock, analysts and investors said they were more concerned about fluctuating oil prices and the vagaries of the stock market than the ethics of investing in Sudan.</p>
        <p>''If it wasn't a problem for PetroChina, it's not going to be a problem for Sinopec,'' said Andrew Look, a strategist at UBS Warburg in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Henry Lee, a money manager at Hendale Asia here, predicted that concerns about Sudan would not derail the offering. ''These companies have gotten very sophisticated at carving out safe territory for themselves,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Lee said he would pass on the shares -- in part because it is an extremely large offering at a time when the appetite for stock issues from China, and Asia in general, seems lackluster.</p>
        <p>PetroChina, after scaling back its offering in the face of protests by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and rights groups, was able to raise $2.9 billion. The shares have risen 40 percent since then, thanks to soaring oil prices and investor disenchantment with technology stocks.</p>
        <p>But investing in oil companies may be as much a roller coaster ride as buying Nasdaq stocks. Analysts say oil prices are likely to swing wildly through the winter, before declining later in 2001.</p>
        <p>Sinopec estimates that the price of crude oil will decline from an average of $26.70 a barrel this year to $21.70 next year and $19.40 in 2002. The company calculates that a $1 decline in the price would result in a relatively modest 4 percent decline in its operating earnings.</p>
        <p>''The integrated nature of our business gives us the ability to mitigate any negative impact from the expected decline in crude oil prices,'' said Sinopec's chairman, Li Yizhong, in a news conference last Sunday.</p>
        <p>The appetite for Sinopec's stock has been slack in the first three days of the offering, according to fund managers. But the underwriters, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and China International Capital, have hedged their bets by parceling out much of the shares to strategic investors.</p>
        <p>These include Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, and BP Amoco, as well as the politically friendly Hong Kong tycoons, Li Ka-shing and Lee Shau-kee.</p>
        <p>None of the investors will get a seat on Sinopec's board, however, raising the old question of who will represent the shareholders. Executives who know the company say investors should be comforted by its chairman, Mr. Li: he helped persuade Beijing to relax state controls on the price of crude oil.</p>
        <p>''Sinopec has always been a commercially minded organization,'' Mr. Troner said. ''Its managers are outward-looking.''</p>
