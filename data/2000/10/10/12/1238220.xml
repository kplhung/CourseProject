        <p>For three months, Susan Boyle said, people have been calling her bicycling and walking group about the chaos on the Brooklyn Bridge. Cyclists complain that pedestrians are freely wandering into their half of the wood-slatted walkway and yelling or even slugging them.</p>
        <p>Pedestrians complain of barreling bicyclists skirting them by just millimeters and of wild careening riders nearly knocking them over and then blaming those on foot.</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. Boyle would say, everybody is right. It is the city that is wrong.</p>
        <p>For years, pedestrians strolled the north side of Brooklyn Bridge walkway, and cyclists pedaled on the south side. Signs and stenciled figures on the slats indicated where each group belonged. The system, while hardly creating harmony, worked, more or less.</p>
        <p>But last spring, the city decided to switch the groups, putting pedestrians on the south and cyclists on the north.</p>
        <p>''It's more scenic, with the view of the Statue of Liberty,'' Thomas Cocola, spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said of the south side. Presumably, slower-moving pedestrians would have more time to appreciate the scenery.</p>
        <p>So the city removed the signs indicating the proper sides for people on foot and on bicycles. And they scrubbed the stencils on slats representing pedestrians and cyclists into pale ghosts. That was three months ago.</p>
        <p>The result has been a stream of people on foot, wandering blithely onto the south side, where the cyclists still ride. Many are tourists who assume, in the absence of directional signs, that they are welcome to roam freely. Most fault the bicyclists, some even yelling or even hitting them.</p>
        <p>''That man on the bicycle, he is dangerous,'' said Marthe Friel, a tourist from Lyon, France, pointing to a passing cyclist. ''He almost ran into me. Where are your police?''</p>
        <p>But Nancy Karb, who lives in Brooklyn and commutes to work on foot or bicycle, was more sympathetic to the cyclists. ''These tourists don't realize they have a right to ride here. They ought to keep out of their way -- over here, on the walkers' side. But how would they know? The signs are down; those universal signals of people walking and riding are gone.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Boyle, who works at Transportation Alternatives, the pro-bicycling and walking group said: ''It has been chaos. We've gotten so many complaints in the past three months. It's crazy not to have any indication where people belong.''</p>
        <p>So yesterday afternoon, Ms. Boyle and a few colleagues at Transportation Alternatives took matters into their own hands. For two hours, they walked the length of the bridge, with homemade metal signs and stencils and cans of yellow paint, acting out their rebellion in what they called street theater.</p>
        <p>In fact, it most closely resembled unpaid maintenance work. With wire, they affixed signs reading: Walk Right, Bike Left, with a transportation official's name and number and suggested passers-by call and complain.</p>
        <p>''The city will put this off forever,'' Ms. Boyle said when she had finished with her stenciling. ''The Transportation Department is so slow and inept.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cocola of the Department of Transportation said that it was the Parks Department that was at fault. It was supposed to put up the signs, as part of the huge multimillion-dollar renovation of City Hall Park in Manhattan near the bridge.</p>
        <p>True, his department had scrubbed the old stenciled figures and removed the directional signs too early, assuming that the Parks Department employees would have provided new signs months ago. ''They didn't do anything, they didn't do anything,'' he said. So, a few weeks ago, the Transportation Department made plans to erect new signs and paint new stencils on October 20.</p>
        <p>For his part, Henry J. Stern, the commissioner of the Parks Department, said he would have been delighted to provide new signs, had anyone called him with the request.</p>
        <p>''It was just a loose end,'' he said. ''We'd have been happy to put up a handful of signs. We put up signs all over the city. If anybody had asked, we would have put up very nice signs, in green and white.</p>
        <p>''But I'm very pleased,'' he said of Mr. Cocola's plans to shoulder the responsibility for the signs. ''Good for them. Congratulations. This all has a happy ending.''</p>
