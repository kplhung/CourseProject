        <p>IT'S no secret around my neighborhood that when it comes to Halloween, my family has problems.

        <p>IT'S no secret around my neighborhood that when it comes to Halloween, my family has problems. I wish I could say that the quarrels the neighbors overhear are confined to such trivial issues as what color Jell-O to use in the human-brain mold or whose turn it is to wear the light-up werewolf fangs.</p>
        <p>But actually, clashes over costumes have escalated to an extent I would not have thought possible back in the days when my daughters were willing to wear any old bunny outfit I picked up at the drugstore.</p>
        <p>The power struggle started a few years ago, when a beautiful black velvet cape that I had lined with canary yellow silk for a certain pint-size Dracula was deemed ''too scratchy'' to wear. Soon after, I overheard one of my daughters describe a ''Dr. Ella (Back from the Dead!)'' name tag on which I had painstakingly dripped fake blood as ''corny.'' Things got particularly ugly last year after a mop head I had dyed black and shellacked was dismissed as looking ''nothing like a Harry Potter wig.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps this year I should have followed my husband's advice to ''not get sucked in.'' But in my heart I knew it would be unfair to deny my children the wisdom of my years, if only to ensure they avoided making the sort of politically incorrect mistake that in 1971 led me to dress as Siamese twins, a get-up that required a friend and me to swelter inside one of my grandfather's oversize undershirts until our unused arms went numb.</p>
        <p>The best solution, I figured, was to shop online. That way, my family could replace our dysfunctional holiday rituals with a new wholesome tradition of cooperative pointing and clicking. Although it would require us to sacrifice our family trip to the local costume store (where we linger every year in front of the plate-glass window that displays a tableau of a mother rat suckling her snarling litter in a bone-strewn graveyard), the selection would be worth it.</p>
        <p>I knew that because I had conducted preliminary research online, ascertaining that a much greater variety of gruesome or weird items than we were used to was only a click away, from the Black Nail Polish and Lipstick set at iParty.com ($3.99) to special effects contact lenses that make you resemble a ''crazy wolf'' at 1stopcontacts.com ($59.99) to the 100-pound ''attack alligator'' prop at Nightmarefactory.com ($8,750).</p>
        <p>Of course, I realize that the pricey alligator may not be for every family -- especially in a year when household Halloween spending budgets nationwide will average $84, according to the American Express Retail Index released last month. The index, based on surveys of parents with children younger than 18, also found that only 6 percent of shoppers would browse or actually buy online for Halloween this year.</p>
        <p>The reluctance of the other 94 percent may have something to do with a fact my children know well: selecting a Halloween costume is a very personal choice. Many people choose costumes that signal an aspect of how they perceive themselves, said Prof. Donald Hill, an anthropologist at the State University of New York in Oneonta.</p>
        <p>''People react to their lives through their costumes, which may sometimes reflect an excess expression of who they are or even a reversal of who they are, or their fantasies,'' Professor Hill said. ''When they shop, they might want to see those costumes or touch them, be close to them.''</p>
        <p>As for me, I didn't want to pressure anyone into being Siamese twins with a sibling. But whom would it hurt if I showed my children possibilities like a homemade face paint recipe (free at About.com), a battery-operated Bates Motel sign ($24.99 at Amazon.com) and anatomically correct hard molded-plastic human bones, $2 a pound at Boneyardbargains.com?</p>
        <p>There are a few caveats. If you patronize smaller, independent online stores, you may have to complete your order by phone or fax. And of course, when ordering a costume, always call first if you are unsure about the size. Also, make sure before purchasing that your order will arrive on time; unless a retailer offers second-day or overnight shipping, don't count on orders placed after Oct. 17 to arrive by Halloween.</p>
        <p>''For small accessory items, you might want to just go to the local drugstore,'' said Lloyd Fero, who owns Funfolly.com. He  used to operate a real store in San Diego, then moved his hundreds of costumes and accessories onto the Internet after he lost his lease a year and a half ago. ''Now, our customers might live in a locality where nothing is available for a hundred miles around,'' Mr. Fero said. ''Or they might be looking for the more unusual items.''</p>
        <p>In that category, the Ben Nye Gel Wound kit, $18.98, includes directions for applying lacerations, bullet holes, burns and slit throats. I also lingered over the site's collection of wigs like the Cowardly Lion ($39.98) the Judge ($11.98) and the Wild Man ($7.98).</p>
        <p>Here's a concern you might not have thought of if you are shopping for a child. ''Make sure you stay away from buying costumes with large feet,'' said Robyn Smith, vice president of merchandising at Estyle.com. ''If they are too big, children might trip and fall.'' Estyle.com offers 21 children's costumes, from $11.99 ( the Little Helper contractor) to $69 (the astronaut).</p>
        <p>''What I need are bloody hooves,'' said Ella, 9. ''For my Evil Cow costume.''</p>
        <p>Although that would clearly violate the large-feet restriction, I was trying to be cooperative. But the best I could come up with after a half-hour of searching online was a pair of withered gray plastic elephant feet at Buycostumes.net ($19.50). Ella stared at the image without comment. We moved on.</p>
        <p>We found plenty of cow costumes, including one at Allcostumes.com featuring prominent udders ($33, fits adults). Unfortunately, none met Ella's stringent requirements.</p>
        <p>''An Evil Cow is neon green with pink spots,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''We might have to make it ourselves,'' I said.</p>
        <p>Now, I'm no rubber rat, but I still feel a powerful maternal urge whenever there's an opportunity to sew a costume for one of my children. Before Ella could protest, I was searching for patterns at the Fabric Link Halloween Costume Closet site.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was the sentimental way I lingered over the pink angel costume that prompted Ella to bolt from the room, calling over her shoulder: ''Why don't you help Clementine instead? She needs a costume.''</p>
        <p>But even Clementine, my 3-year-old, was reluctant to deviate from preconceived notions. Her main Halloween goal was to stage a repeat of her successful trick-or-treat performance last year, when her yellow Teletubbie costume caused neighbors to shriek, ''How adorable!'' as they tossed extra rations of candy corn into her loot bag.</p>
        <p>''I am a Teletubbie,'' she told me.</p>
        <p>Actually, she is a human fly, and likes to keep her intake of miniature Hershey's chocolate bars hovering at a rate of about three per hour.</p>
        <p>''Sweetie, don't you want to try something new?'' I said, pointing out a floppy-eared bunny costume at Spencergifts.com ($23.99).</p>
        <p>''No.''</p>
        <p>''The Teletubbie helmet might not even fit anymore,'' I added, as I showed her a bunny costume with ears lined in pink satin at Etoys.com ($29.99) and a vintage Bugs Bunny costume on eBay.com (bidding was stalled at $4.99).</p>
        <p>''No, no.''</p>
        <p>In the end, my practical 11-year-old, Zoe, suggested a truce: If I agreed not to interfere with costumes, my daughters promised not to vote as a bloc to overrule my Jell-O preference (black cherry) when it comes time to fill the human-brain mold.</p>
        <p>At first, I was touched by that gesture because I know how much it means to the rest of my family to stir canned peaches into a bowl of lime gelatin. Then their father confessed that he had been enlisted to order a second mold (life-size, anatomically correct) from Anatomical.com for $11.95.</p>
        <p>At least they don't know where I hid the werewolf fangs.</p>
