        <p>ALEX WILLIAMS put down his mop and apologized for the mess. ''I had a raging party in here last night,'' he said. Even so, the apartment looked good. A sleek blue sofa and expensive stereo accented the living room. Oak shutters framed wide windows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, 30, an unmarried software designer, moved into Dublin's new Wooden Building two months ago. It is the latest -- and most expensive -- addition to an ambitious state-sponsored redevelopment of Temple Bar, a previously down-and-out neighborhood on the south bank of the River Liffey. The area was full of obsolete four- or five-story brick warehouses and empty lots. About half the warehouses have been completely renovated, half knocked down.</p>
        <p>''I'm in the center of town, but it's quiet, I can walk to work,'' Mr. Williams said of his one-bedroom home that he rents for around $1,100 a month. ''It's like no other building in Ireland, with all the wood and the big canopy at the top, and inside, it's really well finished.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams represents a vanguard demographic in a vanguard type of architecture. In Ireland, a country with Europe's highest rate of home ownership, he is in the first wave of successful young professionals to rent an apartment in the central city. Both the luxury building and Mr. Williams's capacity to live in it would have been unthinkable just a decade ago. Since then, Ireland has become Europe's hottest, fastest-growing economy, drawing a huge influx of high-tech and financial-services companies.</p>
        <p>After a century of exporting its young professionals, the country is enticing them back in droves as well as attracting emigrants. Mr. Williams, who is Irish, lived in Japan, Belgium and the United States before returning to work for an Internet start-up, WorldofFruit.com.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, Ireland became the grateful recipient of substantial urban renewal and tourism grants from the European Union, including $25 million to transform Temple Bar into a new cultural quarter for the city. Still, the Irish, known for their fierce, sentimental love of tradition and for their stubborn independence, view the Europeanization of Dublin with a mixture of pride and alarm.</p>
        <p>Planners were determined not to turn the neighborhood into a EuroDisney of faux-Georgian architecture, but to encourage innovative design. In 1991, Temple Bar Properties, a state-run agency, hired a young team of Dublin architects to draw up guidelines for the 36-square-block area, previously slated to become a city transportation depot. Now, Temple Bar has restaurants, bars, shops, 10 cultural centers and 1,000 new residential apartment units. Of the units, about half were developed privately and the others were commissioned from a variety of architectural firms. The Wooden Building, designed by the Dublin firm Blacam &amp; Meagher, was part of the neighborhood's final development phase.</p>
        <p>The nine-story building, named for its exterior and actually comprising two free-standing halves separated by a narrow air shaft, has 17 one- and two-bedroom units. Part of the building is fully wrapped in untreated iroko wood, part in stucco accented by large iroko-framed windows, and part in thick mortared brickwork. References abound to medieval and contemporary Northern European design. The architects insisted on hiring artisans for much of the custom features, like six-panel oak doors and copper window casements.</p>
        <p>''Temple Bar Properties essentially said, 'Go for it,' '' said Shane de Blacam, a principal architect at Blacam &amp; Meagher and a Dubliner with sparse but unruly reddish-gray hair. ''A lot of the buildings there had been pretty boring. We think our building lives with what the modern notion of a tower is.'' Mr. de Blacam, who worked with Louis I. Kahn in Philadelphia in the early 1970's, is known for his innovative use of timber in such buildings as the Beckett Theater at nearby Trinity College, and in another multistory Temple Bar building that received an award last year from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Blacam said of the Wooden: ''It's appropriate to this climate and culture, and we want it to be about Dublin. I'm delighted people are making a fuss about it.''</p>
        <p>Last spring, its apartments were sold at auction -- a first for the city -- and fetched prices rivaling those in Paris and New York. Mr. Williams's landlord bought his one-bedroom for $287,000. Martin Keane, a bar and nightclub owner, says he bought his two-bedroom (with a small roof garden) for $641,000, not including the parking space. ''The price was higher than I expected,'' Mr. Keane, a married empty nester, said, ''but if you want something bad enough you go the extra mile.'' Some are already calling it Dublin's most beautiful apartment building.</p>
        <p>''The city is being reinvented before our very eyes,'' said Frank McDonald, an architecture and environment reporter for The Irish Times who lives in a converted fifth-floor warehouse in Temple Bar. ''In the mid-1980's, Dublin was a backwater, so incredibly bleak it looked like a different city. There were 150 acres of derelict land. Now, there's hardly any. To a large extent, the inner city has been saved.''</p>
        <p>Today, down the street from the Wooden Building, jazz musicians give free concerts in Meeting House Square under an aluminum awning by Santiago Calatrava, the Spanish architect and engineer. Internet cafes vie with bars for attention from Dublin's young digirati. Half of Dublin's population is under 30. ''I feel like a vanishing breed,'' Mr. McDonald, well over 30, said. ''There's a real sense that the city has been taken over by this changeling species with no memory of thrift, poverty, no folk memory of famine. They're interested in money and having a good time. It's not dissimilar to the U.S.''</p>
        <p>Unemployment is at a record low, 3.8 percent, and jobs have grown 39 percent since 1994. In that time, greater Dublin's population grew 10 percent. With such heady growth comes headaches, especially for planners, environmentalists and those hurt by staggering traffic congestion, currency inflation and escalating housing costs. Dublin, with 1.3 million people -- a much higher figure than planners anticipated a decade ago -- has no subway system. The city will need 200,000 more homes for its workers in the next 10 years, Mr. McDonald said. At the same time, working-class families -- ''true Dubs,'' as they are known -- are being priced out of the city. In short, sprawl has begun.</p>
        <p>''We're at a crossroads,'' Mr. McDonald added. ''Our planning is already infected by an Anglo-American, car-dependent thesis. The question is, how much can you control the spread of the edge city? We haven't yet reconciled ourselves to real urban living and higher density housing. Do we want to be a European city or an American city built around motorways and detached housing?''</p>
        <p>The Irish have always considered apartments as either the unfortunate fate of those on the dole (like Chicago and New York, Dublin is scarred by disastrous public-housing high-rises) or the temporary domain of students. There is still no attempt to institute rent control or fair-eviction laws. The sentiment against renting springs from the oppressive legacy of English landlords. But changing demographics, a dire shortage of affordable housing and longer commutes are making apartment life more desirable.</p>
        <p>The Irish are also catching up to Americans and other Europeans in marrying later, having fewer children and, since it was legalized in 1997, being divorced. As recently as 1972, women were forced to leave civic jobs upon marrying. That has all changed. ''We're a post-Catholic country now,'' Mr. McDonald said.</p>
        <p>The number of single-person households increased 17 percent from 1992 to 1997, and the number of couples without children increased 22 percent in the same period, vividly changing housing needs. Though people are waiting longer to start families, as in other industrialized nations, the change here seems swift and striking.  ''Dublin has acres of mindless, cheap flats,'' Mr. de Blacam said. ''Apartments weren't considered proper. Now, that idea is being completely transformed.''</p>
        <p>In the wake of Temple Bar, other quarters of the city are planned for high-density redevelopment, notably the Docklands, an industrial warehouse and shipping district. Throughout central downtown, planners would like to replace the existing low-rise skyline with a more European seven- or eight-story skyline. For the most part, Dubliners still thumb their noses at anything higher.</p>
        <p>Like so many other cities before it, Dublin is struggling to retain its small-city identity, and the gentrification of Temple Bar has its critics.  Artists, once a catalyst for preserving the area, can no longer compete with dot-comers for rents. The city's oldest Catholic Church, around the corner from the Wooden Building, was converted to what many consider a cheesy tourist operation called Dublin's Viking Adventure.</p>
        <p>''I found it began to show the same trend as SoHo,'' Dr. Mary Corcoran, a sociologist at the National University of Ireland, said. ''An area with a bohemian ambience and low rents for alternative-arts people very quickly became a developers' paradise, with swanky new apartment buildings. The bohemian element feels pushed out -- it's not really an indigenous vernacular community anymore.'' In the last four years, 2,000 to 3,000 luxury apartments have been built in central Dublin, changing the once comfortably dowdy feel of the streets.</p>
        <p>Michael Smith, the National Heritage Trust president, bemoans the loss of the vernacular pub. Only one Temple Bar pub out of every two dozen has retained its character, he said, adding that a lot ''have been plasticated.'' ''It's a drinking mile rather than a cultural quarter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Like New Orleans's French Quarter and London's Covent Garden, Temple Bar became a magnet for college rowdies, young European weekenders and those attending stag parties. Two years ago, pub owners agreed to ban the latter. But what had once been intimate, etched-glass and oak establishments have been  transformed into mega-theme bars, like the All Sports Cafe, Thunder Road Cafe and House of Rock. Initially wanting to attract tourists, the city provided tax incentives to encourage pubs to build or expand in the neighborhood. With the theme bars comes a further dent in Irish identity, even as, ironically, Irish pubs are being replicated elsewhere. Even the Guinness Brewing Company is now owned by a British food and beverage company.</p>
        <p>''In the old pub,'' Mr. Smith said, ''typically the barman would be a true Dub with lots of character and wisdom to share. Now, foreigners have those jobs. Conversation was a major facet of national character, typically veering between politics and quasi philosophy. Now, the standard topic is the price of property.''</p>
        <p>Mr. de Blacam also regrets the change. He said: ''I feel it was wrong to persist with commercial development in Temple Bar, because apartments went for astronomical prices in the end. The wisdom was that shops on the ground floor maximize investment, but if we want children and families to live in the city, that has to change. It may be a long time before we build a city quarter that feels truly residential.''</p>
        <p>Deyan Sudjic, architecture critic of The London Observer and editor of Domus, the Italian design magazine, said that Ireland is not alone in its increasing urban sophistication. ''Housing throughout Britain is finally emerging from the stone ages,'' when only large, crude houses dominated the outer city, he said. The difference is that tasteful single-family houses are affordable in cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh, but not in Dublin, he said, adding, ''Dublin is on an entirely different planet economically.''</p>
        <p>For its part, the Wooden Building also sparked a contentious neighborhood debate over building heights. Originally designed to be four stories higher, the building was reduced when protests forced the architects to compromise. ''We took a strong stance, because Dublin is under enormous, vicious pressure to produce high-rises,'' said Mr. Smith of the National Heritage Trust. ''Now, I'm somewhat embarrassed after what has turned into one of the most exciting and highest quality new schemes, but we needed to stop a dangerous precedent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, preparing for the next party, doesn't think he'll live in Temple Bar forever. ''I'll do it for a year and then see,'' he said. ''I do think the old city is a really nice area, and I might think of buying here. If I have kids, though, I'd probably move back out to the suburbs.''</p>
        <p>Does he think apartment-dwelling will become a commonplace? ''Well,'' he said, ''renting has not been that popular. But we're an adaptive people.''</p>
