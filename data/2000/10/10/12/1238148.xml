        <p>The Su preme Court's federalism revolution</p>
        <p>five years of decisions circumscribing Congressional authority ever more tightly -- arrived this morning at a moment of truth as the justices considered the power of Congress to enforce the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.</p>
        <p>The question before the court was whether Congress acted within its constitutional authority 10 years ago when it made states liable for damages for violating the Americans With Disabilities Act. Given that the disabilities act is arguably the most important civil rights law enacted in the last 25 years, that question, standing alone, would have made this case unquestionably important.</p>
        <p>But as the tense and testy hour of argument made clear, even more was at stake in this challenge by the state of Alabama to the scope of the 1990 law.</p>
        <p>To decide the state liability question, the court has to decide whether the law is a valid exercise of Congress's authority to enforce the 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee. And to decide that, the court may finally have to resolve the question that the recent string of decisions has raised but not answered: Can Congress ever enact into law a view of constitutional rights that is broader than the Supreme Court's own interpretation?</p>
        <p>When, if ever, should the court defer to Congress's own view of its power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to ''enforce, by appropriate legislation'' the amendment's provisions, even if enforcement means something more than the court itself would decree as a matter of judicial interpretation -- a preventive rather than a remedial measure, for example?</p>
        <p>''Deference to Congress means that they across the street get to decide what the Constitution means,'' Jeffrey S. Sutton, representing Alabama, warned the justices, with reference to the Capitol, across First Street from the court building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutton framed his challenge by referring to Chief Justice John Marshall's famous declaration in Marbury v. Madison, in 1803, that ''it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutton said, ''The Marbury power rests here in this building, not anywhere else.''</p>
        <p>The question of how much leeway Congress has is critical because it is not clear that all the conduct the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits or requires is constitutionally prohibited or required. ''Good things that need doing,'' as Justice Antonin Scalia put it in one of his many dismissive references to the law, do not necessarily amount to constitutional violations when they are not done.</p>
        <p>The provisions of the law at issue in this case, Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, No. 99-1240, prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities both in public and private employment and in the provision of public services.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court case began with separate lawsuits against Alabama brought under the law by two employees who accused the state agencies of discriminating against them because of their medical problems, breast cancer in the case of Patricia Garrett and respiratory impairments in the case of Milton Ash. Alabama asserted that it was immune from suit under the 11th Amendment, which ordinarily bars damage suits against states unless there has been a valid abrogation of the state's constitutional immunity.</p>
        <p>It was clear that Congress intended to open the states to private damage suits, so the question became whether Congress had done so properly. That question, in turn, was considerably complicated by Supreme Court decisions in the decade since the law was passed that limited Congress's ability to breach state immunity.</p>
        <p>When Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it invoked two aspects of its constitutional authority: the power to regulate interstate commerce, and the power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to enforce the guarantee of equal protection. In a 1996 decision, Seminole Tribe v. Florida, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not abrogate state immunity under the Commerce Clause.</p>
        <p>That left Section 5, but in several other decisions, the court has ruled, with considerable ambiguity, that Congress's legislative powers under Section 5 are more limited than Congress thought they were. That is how this case came to pose the question of where the limits are. The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, found the law valid as an exercise of Congress's Section 5 authority and rejected Alabama's immunity claim.</p>
        <p>In a real sense, Mr. Sutton's dialogue with the court picked up where it left off almost exactly a year ago, when he represented states that challenged the application to the states of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In a 5-to-4 decision last January, the court ruled in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents that the age discrimination law was not a valid abrogation of the states' constitutional immunity from suit.</p>
        <p>''This case is Kimel, it's exactly like Kimel,'' Mr. Sutton said.</p>
        <p>It fell to the lawyers on the other side -- Michael H. Gottesman, a law professor at Georgetown University, arguing for the two plaintiffs, and Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman, arguing on behalf of the federal government for the law's constitutionality -- to try to convince the court that in fact last year's case and this were critically different.</p>
        <p>Both argued that unlike the scanty record before the court in the Kimel case, which failed to demonstrate that age discrimination by the states was a substantial problem, Congress made the disability law applicable to the states on the basis of an abundant record of irrational state prejudice against people with disabilities, compiled over months of committee hearings and studies by special commissions. The record included some 600 accounts of government actions showing a history of ''pervasive, invidious discrimination against the disabled,'' Mr. Waxman said.</p>
        <p>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the majority opinion in the age discrimination case and who probably represents the plaintiffs' only hope of winning this case, appeared to find the record at least notable, if not conclusive.</p>
        <p>But other members of last term's majority were openly scornful of the evidence that Mr. Gottesman and Mr. Waxman presented. Justice Scalia demanded, ''Do you think it is proper to leap from these psychological generalizations to the conclusion that the states are acting unconstitutionally?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Waxman noted that Congress passed the law before the court made clear the limits on Congress's authority to breach state immunity. ''The precise magic words we expect Congress to use can't fairly be imposed on a coordinate branch of government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It's not magic words!'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy fairly exploded. He said the ''whole point'' of the court's recent precedents -- specifically, the decision he wrote that struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- was that ''when Congress alters the federal balance, it must carefully consider the consequences of doing so.''</p>
