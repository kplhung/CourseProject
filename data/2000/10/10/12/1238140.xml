        <p>SOME actresses can cry prettily, at least on camera, cry so that their noses do not run or their eyes turn red, but Marge Royce, an organizer for the long-running actors' strike against the advertising industry, cannot do this. The nose is not too bad but the eyes turn bright red within moments of hitting an emotional hot spot.</p>
        <p>The first thing that makes her cry: asking whether she's called another actor a scab. Which she has. Though what Ms. Royce seems to be crying about, cries about more than once, is the notion of betrayal; that another actor could cross the picket line.</p>

        <p>SOME actresses can cry prettily, at least on camera, cry so that their noses do not run or their eyes turn red, but Marge Royce, an organizer for the long-running actors' strike against the advertising industry, cannot do this. The nose is not too bad but the eyes turn bright red within moments of hitting an emotional hot spot.</p>
        <p>The first thing that makes her cry: asking whether she's called another actor a scab. Which she has. Though what Ms. Royce seems to be crying about, cries about more than once, is the notion of betrayal; that another actor could cross the picket line.</p>
        <p>It is a far happier thing to ask Ms. Royce about her work. She has made commercials for Glade and Kraft. Now, working on behalf of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, she makes trouble, organizing ''shoot-busts,'' trying to disrupt the filming of commercials that are involved in the six-month labor dispute.</p>
        <p>''We put up light reflectors. We blow whistles. We have machines that blow a sea of bubbles and the wind carries them into the productions,'' Ms. Royce says. ''One of our incredible captains called all his flying buddies to fly over a shoot in New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Now grinning, remembering an outdoor shoot in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>''He was also the same guy who offered to mow the lawns, front and back.''</p>
        <p>What do you get when you cross an actress with an activist? In the case of Ms. Royce, tears, jokes, exhortation. She has also become something of a grass-roots leader. At a rally last month attended by Paul Newman and Richard Dreyfuss, Ms. Royce, 37, drew greater applause.</p>
        <p>What you will not get is objectivity. Ask Ms. Royce if union demands, which involve cable and Internet rates, might hurt the local advertising community and you will get such a perfect bell-shaped laugh that it seems to have been rehearsed. At least used before.</p>
        <p>''Haha! The cost of the actor is 1.4 percent of the total commercial. That makes me laugh when I hear that.''</p>
        <p>Commercials, which Ms. Royce does in addition to community theater and film, have not made her rich. She earns $30,000 to $50,000 a year. The strike has hurt her financially. Home improvements, in the one-bedroom Upper West Side apartment that Ms. Royce shares with her husband, three cats and a dog who was a victim of pup abuse, have been put on hold. The kitchen island is in the living room.</p>
        <p>MS. ROYCE is also offended by insults to the profession.</p>
        <p>''Early in the strike somebody made the comment that it doesn't take a degree from the Old Vic to hold a bottle of Spray 'n Wash, insinuating commercials aren't really acting,'' Ms. Royce says. ''I beg to differ. Because it takes will and focus and concentration, all of which are disciplines of acting.''</p>
        <p>Off to the bedroom we go, where a volume of Strindberg plays is on the bookshelf, to view her spots on television: Ms. Royce, in a comic spot, bemoaning her choice of room freshener; a pitch for chicken pita in which she spoofs a wealthy woman.</p>
        <p>''I was told do Joan Collins and think Young Frankenstein. Not too big, huh?'' she says.</p>
        <p>But all the same, she's watching your face, as you're watching her commercial, to see if you like her.</p>
        <p>Actress, by the way, was not the first career choice for Ms. Royce, who grew up in Chicago, the youngest of six. The first choice was nun. Ms. Royce attended Catholic grammar school and a favorite aunt was a nun, she explains.</p>
        <p>Additional clarification, with the dog snuggled against her.</p>
        <p>''I was probably going to be an actor nun like Sally Field in 'The Flying Nun,' '' says Ms. Royce, who, now that she mentions it, could match Ms. Field in the perky department. ''My aunt's order was pretty out there; they're go women, very empowered. By the time I hit high school I knew I was going to be an actor.''</p>
        <p>There was a problem when Ms. Royce was in high school: Her father, a controller for an insurance company, lost his job when his company was sold. Her father had been a sparkling, funny man, Ms. Royce says; losing his job ''ate at him emotionally.'' With money short, Ms. Royce attended a state school, Northeastern Illinois University.</p>
        <p>''There was no acting department,'' Ms. Royce says. ''After the first semester of college I saw a rehearsal of 'Damn Yankees' and it looked damned. I took it as a sign from heaven.'' Laughing now. ''It was a spiritual two-by-four: Get on with your life.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Royce leaves school, does a summer with the Circle in the Square Theater School in New York. Back in Chicago, she is one of the founders of a women's theater group, the Footsteps Theater Company. She comes to New York. There are some tough times. At one point Ms. Royce has to go to the union for $1,000 to pay the rent, which might explain some of the loyalty she feels now.</p>
        <p>Was there any connection between her union involvement and having seen her father lose his job?</p>
        <p>No, Ms. Royce says. The legacy of her father had to do with how fair he was, how thoughtful of others.</p>
        <p>''Having grown up in the Depression, he made sure people had their paychecks before noon on Friday,'' she says, as the eyes turn red. ''Friday was payday. He was concerned maybe somebody wouldn't have money for lunch and couldn't eat.''</p>
