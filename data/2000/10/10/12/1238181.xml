        <p>Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde said today that he no longer had pain in his neck, that the numbness in his left arm and hand caused by a pinched nerve had improved and that he hoped to start Sunday against the New England Patriots.</p>
        <p>But then a shroud of secrecy descended on the Jets' plans when Coach Al Groh announced that he would know more about Testaverde after watching him practice today.</p>
        <p>That practice, as are all Jets practices, was closed to reporters.</p>
        <p>But after being instructed by the league today to do so, the Jets said that every player practiced and that Testaverde had taken his ''regular turns,'' although there was no explanation as to what that meant.</p>
        <p>Even a seasoned Kremlin observer would be hard-pressed to decipher the slow, grudging trickle of information the Jets are releasing about Testaverde. He has not thrown a football since Sunday, but Testaverde anticipated he would have no problem  throwing. He also said he no longer had a grabbing sensation in his shoulder when he turned to his left.</p>
        <p>The Jets are hoping to force the Patriots to prepare for both Testaverde and his backup, Ray Lucas, and their differing styles. The Jets did nothing to tip their hand in the injury report: they listed Testaverde as questionable, meaning there is a 50-50 chance he would play.</p>
        <p>''I'm back in the bunker on injuries,'' Groh said. ''I'm tired of talking about it.''</p>
        <p>Under usual conditions, Groh is extremely secretive when discussing injuries, but the Jets' paranoia rose to new heights this week.</p>
        <p>After receiving inquiries from the league office and reporters about why Testaverde had not been listed on previous injury reports since his neck injury first occurred against New England four weeks ago, the Jets retaliated today by listing 15 players -- an inordinate number -- on this week's report. All but two of them were listed as probable.</p>
        <p>The Jets, who did not list more than two injuries in any previous week, took a page from the Denver Broncos. After being fined $15,000 in 1998 for not disclosing an injury that prevented John Elway from starting, Denver listed 22 players the next week.</p>
        <p>Groh was testy with reporters, even snapping at the team's spokesman, Frank Ramos, when he began to read the injury report aloud.</p>
        <p>''Just type it up and hand it out,'' Groh said twice.</p>
        <p>Testaverde was more forthcoming about his health, though. He told Groh that he would be able to practice as much as Groh wanted him to this week. When asked if in his heart of hearts, he thought he would start Sunday, Testaverde said: ''I would like to think so. It's going to be a coaching decision. I hope the week of practice goes well. I don't anticipate having any setbacks in practice.''</p>
        <p>Team doctors have told Testaverde that there was no risk of long-term damage if he got hit again. But he said the pain could return if the cortisone shot he received in his neck Monday to reduce inflammation was not as effective as hoped.</p>
        <p>Still, Testaverde does not expect to receive another injection before Sunday's game. He also revealed that the injury caused him to feel shooting pain down his left arm after he threw passes against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Even if the Patriots tried to knock him out of the game, Testaverde rejected the idea that he might be better off missing a week so that he would be rested when the Jets face the Miami Dolphins on Oct. 23.</p>
        <p>''They may do some things to get to me and hit me,'' Testaverde said of the Patriots, ''not knowing if it's going to have any affect and in doing so, taking a risk of giving up some quick points with blitzing.</p>
        <p>''That's all speculation on if I rest, it will be better, if I don't, it will be worse. It could be fine for the rest of the year. We don't know the affect the shot will have from here forward. I've always been a competitive player and I always want to be in there whether I'm hurt or not. So it's up to our medical staff and our coaches to determine who is going to play.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Nose tackle JASON FERGUSON, who missed Sunday's game with an ankle injury, is listed as questionable but is expected to practice. . . . The Green Lantern has gone dark. After WAYNE CHREBET basked in the afterglow of outperforming KEYSHAWN JOHNSON in the Jets' victory over Tampa Bay, and after he showed off a Green Lantern T-shirt to reporters last week, the receiver has avoided reporters since Sunday's game. He showed up RAY LUCAS by throwing his arms up in frustration after several of Lucas's passes sailed over his head. Lucas said he apologized to Chrebet for his performance.</p>
