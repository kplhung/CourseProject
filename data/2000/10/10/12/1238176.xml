        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said tonight that she planned to visit North Korea soon. She will be the highest-level American official to visit the Communist nation since the end of the Korean War nearly 50 years ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright revealed her plans in a brief comment during a speech at a dinner here in her honor given by one of North Korea's top military leaders, Gen. Jo Myong Rok.</p>
        <p>She said she would have more to say about the visit on Thursday.</p>
        <p>A South Korean newspaper reported that the visit will be in December.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright's planned trip is another sign of the slow thaw in relations between the United States and North Korea, which is one of the few remaining Communist dictatorships. On Tuesday, President Clinton met with General Jo, the first time that a president has met with a North Korean official.</p>
        <p>In remarks at a dinner that she gave for General Jo on Tuesday evening, Dr. Albright said that what has been contested ground can, over time, become common ground.</p>
        <p>''Hostility between our two nations is not inevitable, nor desired by our citizens, nor in the interests of our countries,'' she said. ''This is why we must seize the opportunity to take the concrete steps required to open a new and more hopeful chapter in our relations.''</p>
        <p>American troops have been stationed in South Korea since the end of the war in 1953.</p>
        <p>In addition to objections about North Korea's Stalinist ideology, successive administrations have been alarmed by the country's development of nuclear weapons. The Clinton administration has mixed a lifting of some economic sanctions with threats of military force to persuade North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. North Korea is on the State Department's list of states that support terrorism.</p>
        <p>The last year has also seen a thaw in the relations between North and South Korea.</p>
        <p>Families divided for nearly half a century have held reunions, and in June, the leaders of North and South Korea met.</p>
        <p>In a bit of diplomacy, the International Olympic Committee persuaded the two countries to march together at the recent summer games in Sydney.</p>
