        <p>Stock prices gyrated in heavy trading yesterday but finished with sizable losses, deepening the slide that has prevailed with only brief interruption since early September.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology, fell at one stage beneath its low point of the year set May 23, then rallied to show gains for the day before sagging again to wind up with its 13th loss in the last 15 sessions. It closed at 3,168.49, down 72.05 points, or 2.22 percent.</p>
        <p>Other major gauges also lost ground as Wall Street digested the latest round of warnings about third-quarter profit shortfalls and tried to assess the toll that the economic slowdown being engineered by the Federal Reserve will take on corporate performance next year.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 110.61 points, or 1.05 percent, to close at 10,413.79, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index declined 22.43 points, or 1.62 percent, to 1,364.99.</p>
        <p>''You've gone from total complacency to pretty high anxiety levels here,'' said Hersh Cohen, a portfolio manager at Salomon Smith Barney. ''And when people see these big declines, they just sell more.''</p>
        <p>One depressant, analysts said, has been the seasonal sales of losers for tax purposes, typically to offset gains taken previously.</p>
        <p>Brokerage stocks, at least, got a lift in midafternoon when Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the industry leader by market capitalization, disclosed losses of about $89.7 million from dealings in high-yield bonds, many of them telecommunications issues it had underwritten. This was far below the $500 million that had been rumored and that had contributed to a skid in the company's stock, which hit a high of $109.38 on Sept. 11.  Shares of Morgan Stanley rose $3.25 yesterday, to $77.75.</p>
        <p>And while the shares of Yahoo, Lucent and Motorola continued to be pounded after their late-Tuesday profit warnings, Fannie Mae announced a 13 percent rise in earnings and its shares advanced $3.13, to $71.13. General Electric, whose shares have the highest total value of any company, announced record profits, but its stock fell $1.44, to $56.63.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Dow's bull market; the average has not suffered any 20 percent declines since a rise that began Oct. 11, 1990.</p>
        <p>Some analysts are finding grounds for optimism amid the recent gloom.</p>
        <p>''We've had a pretty rough pre-announcement season but the carnage over the past couple of months has been so extraordinary and the sentiment has become so negative that I suspect we're near a bottom,'' said John Kattar, director of United States equities at Boston Company Asset Management.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Mixed</p>
        <p>By Reuters</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday as crumbling stock prices produced some buying of relatively low-risk government debt.</p>
        <p>''The stock market is going down, and that's all guys are trading right now,'' said John Roberts, head of government trading at Barclays Capital.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to a price of 99 27/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 5.77 percent.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32, to 106. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.82 percent from 5.81 percent on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 30-year inflation-indexed bonds:</p>
        <p>(000 omitted in dollar figures)</p>
        <p>High Price: 103.628  High Yield: 3.953%  Low Yield: 3.850%  Median Yield: 3.918%  Accepted at low price: 71%  Total applied for: $9,922,684  Accepted: $5,000,084  Noncompetitive: $15,684  Interest set at: 3 7/8</p>
        <p>The 30-year inflation index bond matures April 15, 2029.</p>
