        <p>Do you think that your time and talent are so valuable you deserve payment not just for doing a job but even for interviewing for one?</p>
        <p>So does Imaxo (www.imaxo.com), a novel Internet job-hunting service that offers a kind of interview bounty.</p>
        <p>Job seekers name the price -- $25 or more -- that will entice them to interview. Alternatively, employers name how much they will offer to draw in qualified candidates.</p>
        <p>The idea is to redistribute recruiting fees, which often go to pricey headhunters, said Amit Bhatiani, Imaxo's chief executive.</p>
        <p>''Most people do not realize that somebody is getting paid for you to go on a job interview,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The bounty is intended to give employers access to passive job seekers -- ''top-notch candidates'' who are ''confident about their chances,'' Mr. Bhatiani said.</p>
        <p>He added that he believed the method should give Imaxo an advantage over regular Internet job boards, whose postings, he said, attract low-quality candidates.</p>
        <p>''You have to extract good employees from their current situations,'' Mr. Bhatiani said. ''The question for them is: If you were incentivized to accept a few opportunities, at what price would you be willing to look?''</p>
        <p>Since its debut just after Labor Day, Imaxo has registered 95 employers and 1,300 job seekers, who post their resumes anonymously. Nearly all 300 of the current job listings are in high-tech fields. It has arranged for 130 interviews, but has no numbers yet on actual job offers.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Bhatiani expected a large discrepancy among interview prices, the typical bounty is between $75 and $100; the price has been as high as $500. After the interview, the employer pays Imaxo 50 percent of the interview price.</p>
        <p>Imaxo is concerned that its system will have greater appeal to less-than-top-notch candidates -- either perpetual job hunters or people scouting for pocket money. So to prevent abuse, it imposed a limit of a dozen interviews per person per year.</p>
