        <p>Allan Leighton, a well-respected British retailing executive, is to become nonexecutive chairman of Lastminute.com on Oct. 20. He will replace Pieter Bouw, who will remain a nonexecutive director. As chief executive of Asda Group P.L.C., a British supermarket chain, Mr. Leighton secured its sale to Wal-Mart last year. He then joined Wal-Mart as chief executive of Wal-Mart Europe, a post he resigned last month. Shares of Lastminute.com, which has struggled along with other consumer-oriented Internet sites, closed at 131 pence, down 6.6 pence.</p>
