        <p>The Police Department quietly suspended Operation Condor for the first 10 days of the month in an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the expensive and often criticized  overtime program, which officials say has cut crime with extra drug sweeps and quality-of-life patrols.</p>
        <p>The $55 million program, which assigns officers on overtime to the extra drug operations and patrols, was suspended as part of Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik's continuing evaluation of the effectiveness of the department's overall antinarcotics efforts, officials said. They planned to use the break as an experiment, and analysts have begun to review how the nine-month-old initiative affects the crime rate and the productivity of narcotics investigators.</p>
        <p>Reported crime throughout the city rose slightly last week, but it was unclear yesterday whether crime went up in areas where the Condor operations had been suspended.</p>
        <p>Officials stressed that no final decision had been made about the long-term prospects for Operation Condor, which came under scrutiny at a City Council committee hearing yesterday.</p>
        <p>Officials in the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani say the program helped turn around the murder rate after it began climbing last year despite continued declines in overall reported crime. But in resuming the overtime patrols yesterday, the department scaled back the narcotics elements of the program, restoring only quality-of-life and warrant sweeps, a move that, along with the experiment itself, suggests that some police officials believe the program needs to be modified or scrapped.</p>
        <p>Despite its successes, Operation Condor has been the focus of controversy. Critics have called its emphasis on low-level offenders too aggressive. They also contend that the stepped-up buy-and-bust operations, performed by undercover officers, have added to the often hostile relationships between police and residents of black and Latino neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Indeed, at the hearing yesterday before the City Council's Public Safety Committee, Council members questioned the department's top narcotics official about the program's cost-effectiveness and impact on community relations. The official, Assistant Chief Charles Kammerdener, defended Operation Condor in his testimony and said it was constantly being re-evaluated. He also said the program had been significantly cut back, but he did not tell the Council members about the 10-day suspension, an omission that later angered Sheldon Leffler, the committee chairman.</p>
        <p>''I think that what it says is, 'We don't want to be questioned in depth about what we're doing,' '' Mr. Leffler said of the Police Department's attitude to the Council's oversight. He referred to Chief Kammerdener's testimony as ''Mickey Mouse'' and said the chief's statements were an example of why administration officials and others who appear before the Council should testify under oath.</p>
        <p>Thomas Antenen, a spokesman for Commissioner Kerik, said there had been no effort to mislead the Council, and he later clarified details of the department's plans.</p>
        <p>Operation Condor began in January as an overtime initiative under which teams of undercover narcotics detectives are paid to work a sixth day, performing their regular tasks for additional shifts each week. After several months focusing largely on undercover narcotics enforcement, the program was broadened to include uniformed officers conducting additional quality-of-life enforcement and patrols to help protect livery-cab drivers, prompted by a spate of robberies and slayings this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, who served in the department as a narcotics detective for four years, began an intensive examination of the department's overall antidrug efforts last month, several weeks after he was appointed the city's 40th police commissioner.  Officials said he was analyzing how overtime money was being spent and reviewing the high percentage of petty drug arrests being made by narcotics detectives. Officials said the review was prompted in part by Mr. Kerik's concerns that overall in the Police Department, misdemeanor narcotics arrests outnumbered felonies by three to one, an indication that a large number of people charged with drug crimes served little or no jail time.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Assistant Chief Kammerdener disclosed for the first time the breakdown of Operation Condor arrests by felony and misdemeanor, figures the department had consistently failed to provide. Of the operation's more than 60,000 arrests since January, 9,179 were drug felonies, 40,137 were drug misdemeanors and 6,968 were violations, offenses that do not rise to the level of a crime. An additional 7,027 arrests were for crimes that were not drug-related.</p>
        <p>Many people have speculated that Mr. Kerik, who earned accolades with a crackdown on overtime costs at the City Department of Correction, where he served as commissioner for nearly three years, would not be a fan of any program that sent police overtime to record levels. Operation Condor represented more than 17 percent of overtime costs in the last fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Even so, police officials have called the program a success, and it was hoped the overtime pay would also serve to raise the morale of police officers and detectives, who have long been embittered over what they see as miserly pay. Indeed, Mr. Giuliani recently credited the program for its success in fighting crime at a ceremony in August honoring Howard Safir, the departing commissioner, who put the program into place.</p>
        <p>Condor grew out of a surge in crime that occurred as police officials decentralized the Street Crime Unit, which had been involved in the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo, and the unit's gun seizures dropped. Officials were looking for a way to address a crime rate that they believed was beginning to tick up because, they thought, more guns were appearing on the street.</p>
        <p>The idea behind Condor was that the constant enforcement pressure of additional teams of undercover detectives in neighborhoods would make criminals reluctant to carry guns on the streets.</p>
        <p>But Condor's success in bringing down the murder rate was often overshadowed by a sense that the enforcement had become overzealous. A series of incidents, including one in which a narcotics detective with his gun drawn chased a drug suspect through a crowded schoolyard, angered community leaders in neighborhoods throughout the city, and prompted complaints that aggressive enforcement in the pursuit of low-level arrests was misguided.</p>
        <p>Councilman Leffler said he had been seeking to question department officials about narcotics initiatives since the death of Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed black man who was shot and killed March 16 in a scuffle with undercover narcotics detectives who mistook him for a drug dealer. While the detectives were not part of Operation Condor, Mr. Dorismond's death became associated with what critics called the department's overly aggressive tactics.</p>
