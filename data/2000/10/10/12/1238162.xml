        <p>In the hours after Hezbollah's capture of Sgt. Adi Avitan, 20, and two other Israeli soldiers at the Lebanese border, his mother dialed and redialed his cell phone. She listened, her eyes glistening with tears, to her son's voice on the message tape. Always she left the same response: ''Adi, come home.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday the battery died. The last connection the mother, Sipora Avitan, had vanished with her son, who was wounded Saturday in a Hezbollah. And the voices left to her were those of government officials and Hezbollah commanders who are wrangling to work out a prisoner exchange.</p>
        <p>To many Israelis this is a sadly familiar standoff, one that many hoped would not be repeated after Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in May. Israeli warplanes have once again roared northward on noisy warning flights over Lebanon. Hundreds of troops have been sent north.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak has reserved the right ''to respond at the time, place and with the means we find appropriate'' if Sergeant Avitan and two other Israeli soldiers, First Sgt. Omar Sawayid and First Sgt. Avraham Binyamin, are not returned.</p>
        <p>The three soldiers, on a patrol, were in a border zone where only heavily armed Israeli units ordinarily travel. Some 15 to 20 Hezbollah gunmen detonated a mine near the vehicle and opened fire. Israeli officers, finding bloodstains in the burned shell of the jeep, concluded that the soldiers had been wounded.</p>
        <p>But army officials said they believed that the men were alive.</p>
        <p>''We continue to hope,'' said Yoel Avitan, Sergeant Avitan's uncle. ''We do not know how badly Adi is wounded. We want the government to push Kofi Annan to send his people to check on him and make sure he is getting proper medical care. We want all this concluded quickly, in a matter of days. And we want all the people to quiet down, to end the protests and create a calm atmosphere to negotiate.''</p>
        <p>Hezbollah has offered to trade the men for Arabs held in Israeli jails.</p>
        <p>The capture of the soldiers has reinforced the sense of isolation among Jews living in the north of Israel, where the rocky hillsides often alternate between Jewish and Israeli Arab villages.</p>
        <p>It comes after almost two weeks of protests by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, which have devastated Tiberias's billion-dollar-a-year tourism industry, built on the sites in Galilee connected with Jesus' life and ministry. The city, with 50,000 residents, hugs the shore of the Sea of Galilee, with Roman ruins, ancient synagogues and a Crusader fortress. Hotels are closed; restaurants are empty.</p>
        <p>Despite pleas by Sergeant Avitan's family for Jews to refrain from anti-Arab rallies, on Saturday hundreds of protesters in Tiberias tossed burning tires into the abandoned, 200-year-old Omari Mosque and chant slogans against Arabs.</p>
        <p>On Monday night, although the police managed to keep protesters away from the mosque, crowds moved from restaurant to restaurant hunting for Arab waiters and dishwashers. Many fled. More than a dozen Jews were arrested.</p>
        <p>Mayor Benjamin Kiryati condemned the anti-Arab protests and called those leading the demonstrations ''hooligans who are not nationalists but bums.''</p>
        <p>Israeli police officers in flak jackets have been stationed near the city's two mosques, including the graceful Omari, named for a Muslim leader who allowed the Jews to thrive.</p>
        <p>''I want to send a message,'' Mayor Kiryati said, ''that we will respect and protect all religious sites. I will begin repairing and painting the insides of the mosques tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Inside a drab, sand-colored, five-story apartment complex, Sergeant Avitan's family received a steady stream of visitors. Soldiers built a simple wooden frame in front of the apartment building so the family could celebrate the Jewish festival of Sukkot, which begins on Friday evening.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Avitan, 20, who was in the second year of a three-year stint in the army, had called his girlfriend less than an hour before he was captured. He described the rolling landscape as peaceful.</p>
        <p>''He spoke about how quiet it was, how beautiful,'' said his Uncle Yoel, ''and the next we heard, he had been taken by Hezbollah. His older brother had served in the same unit in Lebanon. It was his brother we were always worried about. Once Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, we were relieved. We thought Adi would be safe.</p>
        <p>''This hit us like a bomb.''</p>
