        <p>THE old warehouse on Auburn Avenue was long an eyesore, and Alton Evans, 40, can remember when it was worse. Just a few years ago, he said, the building sat gutted, a haven for transients and drug dealers. That was the mid-1990's in the central city neighborhood known as the Old Fourth Ward, and anything could happen. In those days, residents say, the area resembled the Wild Wild West.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, Mr. Evans stood on the same site, at the center of a different sort of activity. He hunkered in his tidy metalwork studio, putting the final touches on an Adinkra symbol from West Africa. His neighbors, Ursallie Smith and Celeste Alexander, laid out swaths of bold-patterned fabric -- ''Ursace,'' Ms. Alexander calls it, to rhyme with Versace -- in their interior design showroom. Around them, in place of urban decay, a concrete honeycomb of lofts buzzed with painters, sculptors, Internet developers, glass blowers, designers of all disciplines.</p>
        <p>Mishele Lesser, 27, a graphic artist and painter, left her door unlocked so neighbors could visit her roomy loft. ''I always wanted to live in a loft,'' Ms. Lesser said, looking up from a computer. ''Living here has made me be more free, because I can get different people's opinion on my work.''</p>
        <p>She was talking about Studioplex, Atlanta's $18.3 million, 225,000-square-foot experiment in urban redevelopment. Two years ago, a nonprofit group called the Historic District Development Corporation took over the disused cotton compress warehouse with a bold plan: in a city of epic suburban sprawl, the group envisioned an arena-size loft community to draw artists and Web pioneers to a poor downtown neighborhood. Some would live and work there. Others, like Mr. Evans, would set up shops to lure visitors. Nonartists were welcome as well. ''We figure that anybody who wants to live with artists is O.K.,'' said Mtamanika Youngblood, president of the development group. ''I look at them as patrons.''</p>
        <p>David Green of Brock Green Architects carved a courtyard down the middle of the old brick warehouse, a 500-foot-long grass swath separating two rows of lofts, galleries and retail spaces.</p>
        <p>Then last year, artists and others started moving in: racially diverse, often young, often single and collectively not beholden to the time clock. A community was born.</p>
        <p>In the evenings, residents gather in the long public courtyard, buoyed by conga drumming from the dance studio upstairs. ''I like to go there and talk about art and smell all the different things cooking,'' said Jim  Alexander, 65, whose showroom loft bustles with his photographs of Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and other musicians. ''Been a real long time since you had white people with an Auburn Avenue address,'' Mr. Alexander said, laughing gently. ''It's getting to be a good mix of people around here.''</p>
        <p>The complex is the ambitious anchor for a larger, block-by-block program to rejuvenate this neighborhood of wooden ranch houses, bungalows and shotgun houses that was once home to the city's affluent black community. Auburn Avenue, once dubbed ''the richest Negro street in the world,'' includes the birth home of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the King National Historic  Site, the city's top tourist attractions.</p>
        <p>But the area has been in decline since the 1950's, when cheap land and good highways carried Atlantans to the suburbs, leaving behind a population that was poorer, older and politically weaker. In the 1960's, as in many black neighborhoods, construction of an elevated highway cut Auburn Avenue in two, casting a blockwide shadow across what remained of the business strip.</p>
        <p>As locals left or holed up indoors, open-air drug markets flowered along the main avenues; moonshine sales and a nickel numbers racket -- literal small change -- endure even today. On a bright morning, Dave MacDonald, 43, who moved to the Old Fourth Ward in 1992, wistfully remembered some of his old neighbors. ''One crack addict drag queen used to walk down the center lane of Edgewood Avenue in a drum majorette uniform at rush hour, holding up traffic,'' said Mr. MacDonald, a social worker and community advocate. ''I canceled my cable because nothing was as dramatic as what was happening on the street.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. MacDonald said, suburban sprawl and its clogged highways are starting to attract a new population to the Old Fourth Ward, with resources the neighborhood needs. ''There was an underground arts movement here 10 years ago,'' said Mr. MacDonald, who is also a sculptor. ''Studioplex is bringing it aboveground.''</p>
        <p>The building now offers 112 living lofts, as well as 41 galleries and commercial spaces, many punctuated with floor-to-ceiling windows to draw in sunlight. About 60 percent of the residents are artists; 20 percent of the lofts are set aside for tenants with incomes below $22,700.</p>
        <p>Amy Sherald, who lives in one of the subsidized lofts, pays just $600 rent for 1,038 square feet, where she lives and works. Ms. Sherald, 27, has spiky brown braids, and Japanese characters tattooed on both arms, ''artist'' on one side, ''strong and tall'' on the other. On a recent afternoon, one of her oversize canvases awaited further work, and a handful of others hung on the loft's spacious walls: naked, shaven-headed figures in cobalt blues and ruddy browns, vistas of strong color vibrant in the natural sunlight.</p>
        <p>Before she moved to Studioplex, Ms. Sherald lived in small apartments with no room for her large works, and she gave up painting. ''I don't think anybody can create in a space where they don't feel comfortable,'' she said. ''I feel comfortable here. And I've gotten a lot of exposure here.''</p>
        <p>The complex hopes to follow successful programs, including several begun by the Minneapolis-based Artspace, where developers used artists -- and federal tax credits -- to jump-start renewal in tough neighborhoods. Besides Studioplex, the development group has built 51 new single- and two-family homes, and rehabilitated another 35, sweeping through the neighborhood a block at a time. Though the Old Fourth Ward is the inner city, most of its terrain is low-density, free-standing homes; a handful of solid structures could anchor a block, Ms. Youngblood said. The new houses follow the mixed grid of the neighborhood, a modest shotgun house, which might sell for as little as $89,000, next to a grander, and much more expensive, Victorian. Mr. Evans, the metal sculptor at Studioplex, saw the bright, pastel new homes as the march of history. ''I was concerned about coming here,'' he said, ''until I saw them building $300,000 homes across the street.''</p>
        <p>Dana White, a professor of urban studies at Emory University, has watched nearly three decades of renewal programs fail in the neighborhood. Most fell short, he said, because they were largely cosmetic; even after the improvements, the stabilizing elements in the community continued to sheer off to the suburbs. Between 1960 and 2000, the city population dropped by 11.8 percent, while that of the city and near suburbs combined more than tripled, according to the Fiscal Research Program at Georgia State University. The current initiative, by contrast, aims to bring in a new urban tribe, to draw on a generation tiring of the suburbs. The 1996 Olympic Games provided early help by bringing people and development money downtown. ''It seems to be the beginning of the first major change in half a century,'' Professor White said, taking care to qualify his optimism. Studioplex will be a test for the development program. Unlike past measures, ''it's building a new type of downtown,'' he said, adding, ''Whether there's enough there to draw visitors and be fully viable, we'll see.''</p>
        <p>For Attiya Melton, a sculptor and ceramist, the complex has been an incubator for collaborative creativity. Ms. Melton, 49, lives in a second-floor loft and has a 3,400-square-foot studio and showroom below. She likes to fire the kiln in the middle of the night, go back up to bed, then come down later to work through  dawn. Sometimes, she said, she has to remember to leave the building.</p>
        <p>Since she moved to Studioplex last December, Ms. Melton has found an almost small-town bonhomie among the other artists. Web designers helped her document her work digitally; Mr. Evans advised her on indigenous American symbols to use in her work; other artists helped her build walls, lent their equipment and shared tips about the best places to buy supplies. It is a place, she said, of ''informal mentoring, just being in the same place, gathering and talking.''</p>
        <p>It is also a place, potentially, for artists to do some business. Louis Delsarte, 56, a painter from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is raising his 6-year-old daughter in the complex. ''I miss New York,'' Mr. Delsarte said. ''That's why I'm here. This, so far, is the closest I've felt to being in New York, because of the communication and the energy.''</p>
        <p>Though he does not show his work at any of the Studioplex galleries, Mr. Delsarte has made valuable contacts among the people visiting the center. In the six months since he moved in, he said, he has sold ''four or five'' paintings, at prices of up to $6,000. Because he sold the paintings himself, he did not have to share money with an agent.</p>
        <p>Nor is the development done. Next March, the development group plans to open a restaurant and coffeehouse in the scrubland behind Studioplex, with a commercial strip to follow. Plans are in the works to build a performing arts theater and to reopen the neighborhood's only school, which closed in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>David Patton, 34, who moved to the neighborhood in 1994, left his job as assistant dean of students at the Emory University School of Law to start the restaurant. After living through the area's rough years, said Mr. Patton, who is president of the development group's board, ''we want to rebuild something that resembles the community when Dr. King lived here, with mixed incomes, and the elderly taken care of.''</p>
        <p>As a retail location, Studioplex has not lived up to what many of the artists hoped. The galleries and shops have had little success drawing tourists from the King sites just down Auburn Avenue. Though a recent National Black Arts Festival drew thousands to the complex, on most days, foot traffic is little more than a trickle. ''If I had to rely on the people who come through here, I couldn't survive,'' said Ms. Smith, 37, the interior designer.</p>
        <p>Michael Syphoe, who oversees commercial development for the development group, argued that the artists underestimate the marketing required to make their businesses work. He named a handful of Studioplex tenants that he expected to fail in the next year. ''This is a business,'' he said. ''I've got some folks who are not go-getters.''</p>
        <p>For all the improvements, the Old Fourth Ward is still rough around the edges. Drug dealers, moved off some corners or buildings, resurface elsewhere. Last Friday, Ernie Geyer, a co-owner of one of the neighborhood's bright spots, a new luncheonette called Thumb's Up, was shot in the leg while taking the day's deposit to the bank. Mr. Geyer was not hurt seriously and has returned to work.</p>
        <p>Even so, the neighborhood is already threatening to become the victim of its own success. Though the development group has taken care not to uproot its poor neighbors, private developers are not always as fussy.</p>
        <p>Dave MacDonald said that the darker signs of gentrification, what he calls ''the predators,'' are creeping in among the pretty renovations. Lately, he said, signs have appeared on telephone poles, saying, ''Christian man seeks to buy your house.'' The offers, he said, are aimed at the neighborhood's poor and elderly residents. ''The predators see a chance to make a buck, and offer people $20,000 for their houses.'' Mr. MacDonald said he rips the signs down, a meager gesture against an unpleasant tide.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, shiny new houses jostle with decaying shells, competing visions of the neighborhood's future. Studioplex has a waiting list of 150 names. For Amy Sherald, the painter, the area's future is already visible, and both wondrous and frightening. With all the new housing going up, she said, ''I'm scared of how traffic is going to be.'' In this town, there is no greater sign of success.</p>
