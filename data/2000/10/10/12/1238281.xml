        <p>CASEY-Sophia. Dr. David Abshire, President and CEO, The Center for the Study of the Presidency, and the Board of Trustees of the Center, observe with deep sadness the passing of a valued and cherished colleague, Sophia Casey. Mrs. Casey was a spirited supporter of the Center at its inception when, as the wife of William Casey, she endorsed the formation of the Center and its concepts and contributed her own ideas, based upon her experience as the wife of a prominent government leader. Your presence was always welcome and will be sorely missed.</p>
