      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Every interpretive singer must decide how to balance the desire to sound beautiful with the quest for dramatic truthfulness, and in this age of mass cosmetic surgery a glossy vocal finish increasingly cancels out the divulging of an inner life. Yet a few singers still know how to balance that equation. And in her first New York nightclub appearance in 35 years, Polly Bergen is a triumphant example of a singer having her cake and eating it, too. Ms. Bergen's opening night show on Tuesday at Feinstein's at the Regency, where she is appearing through Oct. 21, was, in a word, great.</p>
        <p>It was 1957 when Ms. Bergen became an overnight sensation portraying the torch singer Helen Morgan in a television biography. And her recordings from that period showcase a lush pop contralto with some raw edges guided by a brash, extroverted personality that delivered lyrics with directness that sometimes bordered on impatience. Even when singing a mournful song, Ms. Bergen still sounded on top of it all.</p>

        <p>Every interpretive singer must decide how to balance the desire to sound beautiful with the quest for dramatic truthfulness, and in this age of mass cosmetic surgery a glossy vocal finish increasingly cancels out the divulging of an inner life. Yet a few singers still know how to balance that equation. And in her first New York nightclub appearance in 35 years, Polly Bergen is a triumphant example of a singer having her cake and eating it, too. Ms. Bergen's opening night show on Tuesday at Feinstein's at the Regency, where she is appearing through Oct. 21, was, in a word, great.</p>
        <p>It was 1957 when Ms. Bergen became an overnight sensation portraying the torch singer Helen Morgan in a television biography. And her recordings from that period showcase a lush pop contralto with some raw edges guided by a brash, extroverted personality that delivered lyrics with directness that sometimes bordered on impatience. Even when singing a mournful song, Ms. Bergen still sounded on top of it all.</p>
        <p>Her voice on Tuesday was in fine shape, with its rich lower register intact, and her enunciation was as letter-perfect as ever. What has changed is her willingness to put her life on the line with every song, digging into the lyrics and imparting a personal emotional resonance to every phrase.</p>
        <p>Among contemporary cabaret singers, only that ageless bird of paradise, Julie Wilson, invests song lyrics with a comparable sense of drama. And what Ms. Bergen conveys in numbers like ''Stars'' (Janis Ian's extended reflection on the shallowness of fame) and ''The Ladies Who Lunch'' is a complex mixture of rage, strength, vulnerability and the thorny good-natured humor of someone who knows the score.</p>
        <p>More than 40 years after Ms. Bergen first recorded Morgan's signature song, ''Why Was I Born?,'' her present-day version, done as a medley with ''Bill,'' poses the title question with utmost seriousness, then answers it with a humble, no-frills declaration of love. A medley of ''Here's That Rainy Day'' and ''Where's the Boy I Saved for a Rainy Day?'' plumbs the depths of heartbreak and loneliness, while the country-flavored ''He Ain't Mr. Right'' rides a current of sexy humor without turning cheap.</p>
        <p>The ultimate impression left by the show is a portrait of a woman who has led the glamorous life and somehow not lost her humanity.</p>
