        <p>Historically, first debates between presidential contenders have been more important than those that followed.  In other words, first impressions have been difficult to modify.</p>
        <p>But is that so this year? The initial encounter between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.

That is such an equivocal judgment that it may prove tentative. It may well remain open to major revision almost until Election Day, now less than four weeks off.</p>

        <p>Historically, first debates between presidential contenders have been more important than those that followed.  In other words, first impressions have been difficult to modify.</p>
        <p>But is that so this year? The initial encounter between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush produced a highly unusual impact, if the polls are accurate; Mr. Gore ''won'' the debate, in the view of voters, but Mr. Bush picked up more ground in the race for the White House. That is such an equivocal judgment that it may prove tentative. It may well remain open to major revision almost until Election Day, now less than four weeks off.</p>
        <p>If Wisconsin voters are as malleable this year as they have shown themselves to be in the past, there was much tonight that might have prompted rethinking -- especially as regards style. While the candidates broke little new substantive ground, Mr. Gore seemed much less preachy and Mr. Bush seemed less perplexed when confronted with detailed queries on foreign policy, speaking with apparent ease about past crises in Nigeria, Haiti and the Balkans.</p>
        <p>Four professors of political science at the University of Wisconsin, commenting on the debate at the request of The New York Times, described it as vastly different, in many respects, from the candidates' initial meeting. In varying degrees, they described Mr. Bush as this evening's winner.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles O. Jones, professor emeritus of political science, said the conversational format worked a hardship on Mr. Gore, because ''it's hard for a fighter to sit down.''</p>
        <p>''I thought Bush did very well,'' Professor Jones said. ''There's no longer any stature gap between the two of them. I also thought Bush looked more presidential tonight.  What he had to do was show command, and he did it. As he said, the presidency is not just the president; it's a team, and I was very impressed by how well Governor Bush's team has prepared him on foreign policy, how well he absorbed it and how skillfully he used it. He did that as well on several of the complicated domestic issues.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Professor Jones said, Mr. Gore did not fully ''establish his personal authenticity.''</p>
        <p>Prof. David Cannon said: ''This was certainly very different in tone, and there was a remarkable lack of major disagreements, especially at first. Some that exist were not brought out, like affirmative action, where they're on diametrically opposed sides. But both appear to have done what they had to do. Bush was quite articulate on foreign affairs -- he named names, he discussed policies -- and the vice president was friendlier, less condescending.''</p>
        <p>It was not so much that the nominees backed away from previous policy divergences; they made their differences on health care and gun control just as clear as in the past.  Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Bush's record in Texas, and Mr. Bush again painted his opponent as a creature of Washington and big government. But for the most part they cloaked their differences in polite language.</p>
        <p>''Bush fought him to a draw,'' said Prof. Kenneth Goldstein. ''He didn't get blown away on foreign policy, not at all, which I thought he would.  That's bad for Gore. Bush mangled a few verbs and a few ideas. But it comes down in the end to who you think this election is about, and for whatever reason, it's about Al Gore.  He has to connect. But he hasn't, and it's not enough just to show that he would have won a debate when they were in high school.''</p>
        <p>Virginia Sapiro, another professor, said that neither candidate ''seemed as canned as last time,'' and that both had clearly made readjustments.</p>
        <p>''Gore's handlers got him to sit back and relax,'' Professor Sapiro said. ''But that is a very hard style for him, because he's an aggressive, hard-hitting debater by nature, and I thought the change disabled him to a certain degree. Bush looked a lot more certain and a lot stronger this time, and he was funny, too.''</p>
        <p>Here in Wisconsin, whose 11 electoral votes are among the most hotly contested in the country, significant numbers of voters remain undecided. That is as true in Madison, the capital and the seat of the University of Wisconsin, which usually goes Democratic, as in the area stretching southwest from Green Bay to Appleton, which is normally a Republican stronghold.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore speaks in Milwaukee at midday tomorrow, it will be his sixth appearance in Wisconsin in the general-election campaign. Mr. Bush has been here six times, too.  Both parties continue to advertise heavily here.</p>
        <p>In the last 10 presidential races, Wisconsin has voted Republican five times and Democratic five times. Its Congressional delegation is split, five Democrats to four Republicans, and each party controls one house of the State Legislature.</p>
        <p>Since the first debate, major developments have thrust foreign policy back into the forefront of the news.  The peace process in the Middle East has been threatened by violence in Israel, and Slobodan Milosevic has been driven from power in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>But if voters here and in the other battleground states were looking for broad statements of principle on American relations with other nations, they did not get them. Jim Lehrer, the moderator, tried to elicit such comments right at the beginning of the 90-minutes session, which took place in Winston-Salem, N.C., but he got mostly rambling, general responses from both candidates.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush later discussed the Middle East in some detail, showing a surer hold on specifics than he did in talking about foreign affairs last week. Mr. Gore, for his part, refrained from the superciliousness that he had exhibited as Mr. Bush dealt with the several subjects last week. That had grated on many voters. Both men were careful not to slam the other's point of view, something that the voters dislike; indeed, they sounded courtly at times.</p>
        <p>Almost 40 uninterrupted minutes were devoted to foreign policy, much more than in any other presidential debate in the last few electoral campaigns. Though the two men clearly disagreed on the worth of nation-building missions, Mr. Bush said the discussion sounded at times like ''a love fest.'' Each made small, sometimes ironic jokes that reinforced the sense of good will and lowered the political temperature.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Bush is much less experienced in foreign policy, the fact that Mr. Gore often said he agreed with Mr. Bush on many points may have redounded to the governor's advantage.</p>
