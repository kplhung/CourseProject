        <p>A California judge ordered the Ford Motor Company yesterday to recall and repair nearly two million cars and trucks after concluding that the automaker knowingly installed defective ignition systems in as many as 22 million vehicles nationwide and concealed the defects from consumers and regulators.</p>
        <p>The order, which Judge Michael E. Ballachey of Superior Court first indicated he would issue two months ago, was the first recall imposed on a carmaker by a judge in United States history. The case affects vehicles that were made between 1983 and 1995 and registered in California. If Ford is unsuccessful in persuading an appeals court to stay the order, the company will have to begin the recall as soon as a special referee, appointed yesterday by Judge Ballachey, decides what steps Ford must take  to fix the ignition system.</p>
        <p>Lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the case, more than three million current and former Ford owners, have said a severe design defect that could have been avoided at relatively little cost to Ford causes the engine to stall when an ignition system part on the engine's distributor gets too hot. As a result, they say, it is not uncommon for the cars to shut down at perilous moments, like highway travel or while making left turns across oncoming traffic.</p>
        <p>The part in question, known as a thick film ignition module, regulates electric current to the spark plugs. It was installed from 1983 to 1995 in Ford models like the Bronco, Escort, Grand Marquis, Mustang, Sable, Taurus, Tempo, Thunderbird, Topaz and Town Car.</p>
        <p>At a hearing yesterday in Superior Court in Oakland, Judge Ballachey criticized Ford's lawyers, saying some of their claims were out of ''Alice in Wonderland,'' for suggesting both in and out of the courtroom that the recall was unjustified because there was no evidence of any injuries or deaths. Earlier in the case, the company had prevailed upon the judge to exclude such evidence to avoid inflaming a jury.</p>
        <p>''This case was about the concealment of dangerous conditions,'' Judge Ballachey said. ''I don't think you have to kill someone to have an unsafe car.''</p>
        <p>During the trial, a steady stream of Ford safety experts said there was nothing unsafe about a car shutting down while on the road. Appearing exasperated by Ford lawyers who repeated that assertion, the judge asked: ''Take your car out on a freeway and go 70 miles an hour. Shut your engine down and tell me that's not unsafe?''</p>
        <p>Ford lawyers appeared confident that they would prevail when they appealed the recall order.</p>
        <p>''The company feels it's not justified by the evidence,'' said Richard C. Warmer, a Ford lawyer. ''These vehicles are safe and this case is built on fiction.''</p>
        <p>Responding to the judge's decision in the case, Howard v. Ford Motor Company, the company issued a written statement saying that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the only agency that can order a recall.</p>
        <p>Ford, which has long denied that the ignition system was defective or caused any fatal accidents, has settled at least four lawsuits involving serious injuries and at least four deaths. Many of the personal injury lawsuits filed against Ford accusing it of defective ignition systems have been sealed at Ford's insistence, although Judge Ballachey permitted details of some of them to be made public by entering them into the court record.</p>
        <p>A study that was prepared for the plaintiffs in the California case and was cited in Judge Ballachey's decision found that the drivers of the 22 million cars equipped with the ignition system faced a 9 percent greater chance of being in a fatal crash. Ford contests that finding but stopped putting ignitions on distributors after the 1995 model year.</p>
        <p>The case has emerged as a second serious problem for Ford, which is already trying to reassure customers that it produces safe vehicles after the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires and scores of deadly crashes involving rollovers of Ford Explorers. Legal experts say that in addition to the recall, Ford faces possible damages of $3 billion in the California ignition case. Similar ignition cases filed on behalf of large groups of car owners are pending in five other states.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's decision had been widely expected because Judge Ballachey issued a tentative decision two months ago. That decision described a huge corporate cover-up in which Ford concealed a design flaw from regulators and consumers that affected 22 million cars produced between 1983 and 1995, almost 15 million of which remain on the road. At that time, he announced his intention to issue the recall order but gave the parties a few weeks to make more arguments before making his decision final.</p>
        <p>Judge Ballachey appointed Jerome B. Falk Jr., a California lawyer, to help organize the recall, and issued a tentative schedule for a jury trial to determine the final unresolved legal issues from the case. Last year, a jury fell one vote short of finding that Ford had concealed the safety defect, prompting the judge to issue his decision. The plaintiffs' lawyers have sought the second trial to consider punitive damages against Ford. Judge Bachelley ruled yesterday that that case would begin in March.</p>
        <p>Lawyers representing the car owners calculate that they could be awarded as much as $3 billion in compensation for violation of a state antifraud statute. While such an award would almost certainly be appealed, such a proceeding would require the company to post a bond equivalent to 10 percent of the judgment, which could be as high as $300 million.</p>
