        <p>The rolling Clwydian Hills present a serene landscape of sheep pastures, signposts in the consonant-thick Welsh language and hamlets of stone cottages with smoke curling idly from chimney tops. It's hardly the place you would expect to find the leader of a popular uprising that brought an entire country to a halt.</p>
        <p>Follow a hedged lane past the White Horse pub, step across a cattle grating, knock on the door of a yellow farmhouse with boots and saddles in the hall and prize ribbons from pony shows in the parlor, and Brynle Williams appears.</p>
        <p>''I'm not very eloquent with words, and what you see is what you get,'' he said. He glanced down at his belly protruding from his shirt. ''And it's not pretty,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Williams, 51, led a fuel price protest at a nearby refinery that rapidly swept across Britain, emptying 90 percent of the country's gas stations, gaining overwhelming support from the very motorists it was inconveniencing and turning the British public against a government that had been enjoying broad approval.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams filled blue plastic buckets with feed grain as he recalled September's standoff with Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>
        <p>''I'm absolutely flabbergasted,'' he said. ''I still can't comprehend that us local boys confronted an elected government. It just doesn't happen to a simple old farmer's boy. It's like something you see come out of Hollywood.''</p>
        <p>The only people more surprised than Mr. Williams at the mouse-that-roared consequences were Mr. Blair and members of his government who saw their self-proclaimed ability to read the public mind blindsided by the nationwide disaffection that coalesced around the picketing farmers and truckers.</p>
        <p>At 10 Downing Street, government press officers denounced the movement as a right-wing show of force and asserted, on scant evidence, that drivers and their families were being intimidated by picketers. Mr. Blair demonized the protesters and labeled their actions an ''affront'' to the nation. It was a tone-deaf response from a political leader famed for having perfect pitch.</p>
        <p>That the British public would turn its back on the most popular prime minister in British history, give the marginalized opposition Conservatives their first lead in the polls in eight years and shift its regard from a stylish world leader to a rumpled Welsh farmer exposed the weakening of traditional bonds of party allegiance that nonideological politics have brought about and pointed up the volatility of voters six months before a likely election.</p>
        <p>It was a very British protest, with no confrontations and not a single arrest. French fishermen and drivers, who had staged similar fuel price demonstrations the week before, had been denounced as ruffians by the same people now holding up the British protesters as foot soldiers of democracy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams unexpectedly succeeded in uniting various strands of antigovernment discontent over such things as waiting lines in National Health Service hospitals, paltry pension increases, falling farm prices, lengthening commercial red tape and rising taxes.</p>
        <p>''They weren't backing me,'' Mr. Williams theorized. ''They were backing themselves.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Blair came across as arrogant and distant, Mr. Williams sounded authentic and grounded. His 200-acre plot is the same one his grandfather and father farmed, and his 26-year-old son wants to continue the family tradition. ''People have asked if there is any political motivation behind this, and I tell them it is one thing and one thing only -- to keep my son on this land,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The protest began with oil, but it also reflected notions of community, family and the countryside way of life versus a government accused of being captive to an urban elite. Mr. Williams looked out across his green hills and said that 42 farms had disappeared from the three-mile-long valley in the past 20 years. ''We are a forgotten nation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Complaints about gasoline and diesel costs were a significant flash point by themselves. At $4.60 a gallon, Britain's pump price is the highest in Europe, and 73 percent of it is tax. Added to that was the leverage that the practice of just-in-time inventorying gave to a small group of truck drivers. They were able to dry up filling stations in days.</p>
        <p>The government was shocked at its powerlessness. Mr. Blair pulled all the usual levers -- he summoned the major oil company chairmen, sent in the police, threatened to call out the military and promised resumption of normal supplies in 24 hours. None of them worked.</p>
        <p>The protest, hatched early on the morning of Sept. 7 in a farmers' gripe session at the cattle market in St. Asaph, swiftly became national, coordinated loosely by mobile telephones -- even though Mr. Williams is unable to operate one. ''I have three of them here in the house, but I don't know how to drive them,'' he said. ''I'm not technically minded. It's a bloody curse.</p>
        <p>''What I'd do is I'd ask a fellow with one to call someone he knew and I'd say: 'Hello, how far are you from such and such? Do you know somebody? Right. See what you can do.' And that's exactly how it happened. We're not that clever. But we're all in business around the country, and between us we know a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>By the sixth day of blockades around the fuel storage depots and refineries, supermarkets began the first rationing of bread since World War II, one car manufacturer reported it was 12 hours away from closing its European production sites, and the health service faced postponing critical operations.</p>
        <p>With the kind of deft timing that had once been the forte of Mr. Blair, Mr. Williams called off the protests at a critical moment the next day, Sept. 14, asserting in a 5 a.m. statement that the demonstrators had gained the ''high moral ground.'' He said they would give the government 60 days -- a knowing date since a pre-budget statement is due by then -- to come up with ways to give the truckers and farmers fuel price relief.</p>
        <p>What brought about his opportune decision? ''If we'd have let it go on, I'm more than certain there would have been some unpleasant incident somewhere that would be associated with us,'' he said. ''I reckoned that by lunchtime the government would have found someone somewhere who died peacefully in his sleep in a nursing home, and it would have been attributed to us.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Blair and his treasury secretary, Gordon Brown, have insisted they cannot give in to the specific demands that they cut the fuel tax. But they have hinted strongly that they will find other ways to address the truckers' and farmers' complaint. [Last Friday Mr. Brown held an unpublicized meeting in Leeds with freight transport representatives.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams is now so well known in Britain that letters addressed simply ''BW, Wales,'' and ''Brynle, petrol'' reach him. He has made so few enemies that he can laugh about them.</p>
        <p>''My face is sure to be on many dartboards around the country,'' he said. ''And I heard a better one last week -- someone said they're putting my picture above fireplaces now to keep children away from the flames.''</p>
        <p>He says he is happy to retreat to his hillside farm and have consumer groups and elected officials take up his cause. ''I don't speak in behalf of the nation,'' he said, ''and I would appreciate that quote, 'Brynle Williams doesn't speak in behalf of the nation.' ''</p>
        <p>But for one remarkable week, he did.</p>
