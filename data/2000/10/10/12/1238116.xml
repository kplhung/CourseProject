        <p>Once political candidates had to explain their divorces, but Hillary Clinton, candidate for the Senate, is being asked to explain her marriage. She faced the question again on Sunday, during her debate with Rick Lazio. Why, she was asked, does she stay with her husband? Her answer -- that the choices she made were right for her -- was as unsatisfactory to her critics as her previous statements explaining her marriage.</p>
        <p>The questioning of Mrs. Clinton for staying with Bill Clinton comes from people of all political persuasions, but it is especially odd coming from the right, where the conventional rhetoric so often touts the sanctity of marriage.</p>
        <p>Yet, there is Andrea Peyser, a conservative columnist for The New York Post, knocking Mrs. Clinton for ''her complicity in the sham that is the Clinton marriage.'' There is George Will in a sidewise swipe casually disparaging ''the bargain'' that Bill Clinton and his wife ''call a marriage.'' And there is The National Review, which, after noting in December 1999 that Hillary Clinton had said in 1992 that ''she was no Tammy Wynette, 'standing by my man,' '' went on to ask, ''Would even Tammy allow herself to be so used?''</p>
        <p>The implication is that Hillary Clinton stays married for Lady Macbeth-like reasons -- not for love, but to advance her career.</p>
        <p>But conservatives are trying to have it both ways if they implicitly criticize Mrs. Clinton for staying in her marriage while touting the institution of marriage at the same time.</p>
        <p>Of course, we know little of the interior emotional landscape of the Clintons' marriage. But staying in an imperfect marriage is a perfectly reasonable choice for many women. And the pummeling of Mrs. Clinton for not getting a divorce -- no matter where it comes from -- not only is unfair to her, but sends a bad message to other men and women struggling with decisions about their marriages.</p>
        <p>Ideally, we'd all like to be madly in love with one person for a lifetime. But in place of that ideal, many couples have workaday marital partnerships that deliver important benefits to them, not to mention their kids. Divorce is typically hard on women's  mental and physical health, relationships with kids, personal happiness and finances.</p>
        <p>For an erring spouse, divorce is like the neutron bomb of punishments. If you've been married any length of time, and especially if you have children together, a wife can't divorce her husband without, in many cases, punishing herself and her kids as well. So if a husband does wrong, a perfectly intelligent wife like Hillary Clinton  might say, Why should we all suffer?</p>
        <p>And if divorce is a gateway to happiness, why is it that a national annual survey by University of Chicago found that just 18 percent of divorced women say they are very happy?</p>
        <p>In my research, I look at what happens to bad marriages that don't end in divorce, using the National Survey of Families and Households by the University of Wisconsin. Of people who rated their marriages in 1987 as very unhappy, but did not divorce, 70 percent said five years later that the marriages were either ''very'' or ''quite'' happy. Just as good marriages go bad, bad marriages can go good.</p>
        <p>Our job as a society is to respect a spouse who forgives an erring mate and stays married. It makes no sense to say that we should support marriages while at the same time castigating one woman for deciding not to end hers.</p>
