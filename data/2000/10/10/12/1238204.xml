        <p>SAY what you will about scoreless innings and second guesses, it was refreshing yesterday to watch Joe Torre sit in the Yankee dugout and wait out an offense as if it were a bus he believed was just running late.</p>
        <p>Twenty-one innings the Yankees were run-less, dating to David Justice's home run in the fourth inning of Game 5 in Oakland Sunday night. They were tamed in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. They couldn't score with the bases loaded and none out in the first inning yesterday of Game 2. They left eight runners on through seven innings, and seemed to be looking into the postseason abyss.</p>
        <p>Candidates for president reinvent themselves when a half-dozen critics wave a cautioning finger. Torre's response to the dangling of a dynasty was a slight rearranging of the furniture, dropping Paul O'Neill from third to seventh in the batting order, and moving David Justice up.</p>
        <p>Then he waited, and waited, and waited, until Justice led off the eighth inning with a double to the center-field wall, igniting a seven-run outburst for a 7-1 victory over Seattle that squared the series as it heads West.</p>
        <p>Good for Torre, who understands he is not managing the Yankees of old, or even last year. But he's come this far with his core players, come through four years and three championships, and as he said after Orlando Hernandez kept him close and his hitters finally rewarded his patience, ''When you look on the bench, who are you going to replace my guys with?''</p>
        <p>More than 50,000 self-appointed candidates to succeed him, and one owner who employs him, no doubt would have been happy to answer. Luis Polonia. Glenallen Hill. Any live body capable of swinging a bat.</p>
        <p>When Bernie Williams rolled into a 2-3 double play after the Yankees had loaded the bases against John Halama in the first inning, surely some took it as the precursor of doom. Torre said he and Don Zimmer looked at each other and almost laughed. Funny? No. Amazing? Yes. Williams somehow managed to squib the ball just enough so that the Mariners' catcher, Dan Wilson, could field it with his foot on the plate.</p>
        <p>Scott Brosius got himself picked off first in the third inning before a Derek Jeter single. Justice rolled out to second with two out and two on in the fifth. Jeter struck out with the tying run at third in the seventh.</p>
        <p>''Jeter walked by me and I said, 'Are you guys trying?' '' Torre said. ''That's just the human part of the game.''</p>
        <p>Such recognition has made Torre the ideal manager and stabilizer for a George Steinbrenner team. Maybe only Torre would have stuck with O'Neill, bad as he's been, in what are likely the dying days of his Yankee career. If he were a pitcher, a David Cone, of course O'Neill would have been on the bench. There are limits even to Torre's loyalty, but as he said, ''I can't be swayed by the fact of somebody being in a slump, even if that slump lasts until next spring.''</p>
        <p>Not just ''somebody.'' One of ''my guys,'' his three-time champions. ''A great deal, 99 percent, probably,'' he said, when asked how often the past impacts on the present.</p>
        <p>O'Neill had come up in the sixth inning with two out and Tino Martinez on second, without a postseason R.B.I. to his name. Halama, the left-hander, was still in the game. The crowd reacted restlessly. Where was Hill, the big right-handed bat?</p>
        <p>O'Neill bounced out, wide of first. There were boos as the Yankees' scoreless streak hit 20, then 21, as they came to bat in the eighth.</p>
        <p>''You've been through it before but still the human element takes hold,'' Torre admitted. ''There's the tension and the thought of going on the road 0 and 2.''</p>
        <p>Justice's double and a base hit by Williams produced, finally, the long-awaited run. Martinez singled. Jorge Posada smashed a ball off Mark McLemore's glove at second. The Yankees had the lead and were soon blowing the game open, with even O'Neill getting his R.B.I., with a sacrifice fly to left.</p>
        <p>''Did you think about bunting Posada?'' someone asked Torre, a question he had heard the previous night, too.</p>
        <p>''Everybody with these bunt questions, it's driving me nuts,'' he said. ''Guys who have not bunted all year, you think, well, go ahead and lay one down.'' He shook his head and said, ''Give somebody a bat -- that's a given.''</p>
        <p>That's the track record, at least for his team, his guys. Sooner or later, they will hit. They will score. Until Seattle proves otherwise, they will win.</p>
