        <p>The novelists Susan Sontag and Joyce Carol Oates and the historian Jacques Barzun are among the finalists for the 2000 National Book Awards, the National Book Awards Foundation announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The foundation named 20 finalists over all in categories for fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people's literature, singling out a range of writers from Mr. Barzun, 93, to the first-time author David Levering Lewis.</p>
        <p>Of the candidates, nine are previous National Book Award finalists, and two -- Ms. Oates and the poet Galway Kinnell -- are previous winners.</p>
        <p>This year Ms. Oates was cited for her novel ''Blonde'' (Ecco Press/HarperCollins), a portrait of Marilyn Monroe based on biographical and historical sources. She won a National Book Award in 1970 for ''Them'' and was named a finalist four times between 1968 and 1990.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sontag was cited for her novel ''In America'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), a fictional portrait of a Polish actress who travels to California that was based on the life and career of Helena Modjeska.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sontag was a finalist in 1967 for ''Against Interpretation and Other Essays.''</p>
        <p>Other fiction finalists are Charles Baxter, for ''The Feast of Love'' (Pantheon Books); Alan Lightman, for ''The Diagnosis'' (Pantheon); and Francine Prose, for ''Blue Angel'' (HarperCollins).</p>
        <p>Mr. Barzun, who has written more than 30 books and was a finalist in 1960, was nominated in nonfiction for his encyclopedic survey of the last five centuries, ''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present'' (HarperCollins).</p>
        <p>Other nonfiction finalists include Patrick Tierney, for ''Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated the Amazon'' (W. W. Norton), an account of anthropologists who studied the Yanomani Indians with methods that now are being debated in academia.</p>
        <p>Also included in this category are Nathaniel Philbrick, for ''In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex'' (Viking Penguin); David Levering Lewis, for his biography ''W. E. B. Du Bois: The Fight for Equality and the American Century, 1919-1963'' (Henry Holt); and Alice Kaplan, for ''The Collaborator: The Trial and Execution of Robert Brasillach'' (University of Chicago Press).</p>
        <p>In the poetry category, finalists include Mr. Kinnell, a 1983 National Book Award winner, for a collection of his poetry spanning 24 years, ''A New Selected Poems'' (Houghton Mifflin). Other finalists are Kim Addonizio, for ''Tell Me'' (BOA Editions); Lucille Clifton, for ''Blessing the Boats: New and Selected Poems 1988-2000'' (BOA Editions); Kenneth Koch, for ''New Addresses: Poems'' (Alfred A. Knopf); and Bruce Smith, for ''The Other Lover'' (University of Chicago Press).</p>
        <p>The finalists in the category for young people's literature are Adam Bagdasarian, for ''Forgotten Fire'' (Dorling Kindersley); Michael Cadnum, for ''The Book of the Lion'' (Viking, Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers); Carolyn Coman, for ''Many Stones'' (Front Street); Jerry Stanley, for ''Hurry Freedom!'' (Crown Publishers); and Gloria Whelan, for ''Homeless Bird'' (HarperCollins Children's Books).</p>
        <p>The finalists were chosen from a pool of 835 titles submitted by 198 publishers.</p>
        <p>The winners are to be announced on Nov. 15 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 13, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about the finalists for the National Book Awards referred incorrectly to the career of one finalist. David Levering Lewis, who was named for his biography ''W. E. B. Du Bois: The Fight for Equality and the American Century, 1919-1963,'' has written nine other books, including the first volume of the Du Bois work, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1994; he is not a first-time author.</p>
