        <p>The Senate, as expected, approved harsher punishment today for people who bring women and children to the United States and force them into prostitution or sweatshop labor.</p>
        <p>The vote, 95 to 0, came five days after the House approved the measure, 371 to 1. The legislation now goes to President Clinton, who has said he will sign it as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>''This bill will take immediate action against international sex trafficking, before the lives of more women and girls are shattered,'' said Senator Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who was a sponsor of the measure.</p>
        <p>Though numbers are elusive, government investigators have estimated that 45,000 to 50,000 women and children are brought to this country each year by people who promise opportunity but force them into sexual exploitation or involuntary servitude, either in homes or shops.</p>
        <p>Since many victims are not legal residents and face arrest and deportation if discovered, they are reluctant to seek help from the authorities. As another sponsor, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, put it, ''We punish the person for the act of being trafficked.''</p>
        <p>The measure enacted today establishes specific laws against trafficking, punishing the worst violators with prison terms of 20 years to life and forcing them to compensate their victims.</p>
        <p>It also provides special visas for some victims, so they could stay in the United States while their exploiters are prosecuted and perhaps even permanently. Up to 5,000 of these visas could be granted a year.</p>
        <p>In the absence of such legislation, prosecutors have often turned to related laws, like those pertaining to document fraud or illegal interstate commerce, to bring violators to justice and have settled for lighter sentences than they think the facts merit.</p>
        <p>The bill also provides for an office within the State Department that would direct and coordinate federal efforts to deal with trafficking in human beings. Another provision reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act for five years, allocating $3.3 billion to increase financing for shelters for victims of domestic violence and for law enforcement officials who investigate it.</p>
