        <p>Despite an intensive international effort to defuse the tension here, the violence continued today, and Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Israelis that renewed terrorism by Islamic militants could follow the rioting and gun battles of the last 13 days.</p>
        <p>The funeral procession today of a slain American-born Jewish settler, which was stoned by Palestinians, set off hours of gun battles between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the volatile Nablus area on the West Bank. In clashes elsewhere, three Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops, bringing the number of dead to at least 93.</p>
        <p>While foreign diplomats here sought Israeli-Palestinian agreement on what kind of fact-finding body should examine the deadly conflict -- a key to arranging a meeting between Mr. Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat -- President Clinton said today that he or Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright might visit the Middle East. But most Israeli and Palestinian officials do not expect a summit meeting convened before the Arab world gathering in Cairo on Oct. 21-22.</p>
        <p>[Late Wednesday, Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations said the Israeli and Palestinian leaders had agreed to three-way talks led by the United States that could begin as early as Thursday, Reuters reported. The meeting would involve the trilateral security committee, first set up in 1998 and consisting of senior military and security officials of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. George J. Tenet, director of central intelligence, would be chairman of the meeting.]</p>
        <p>In Cairo today, Egyptian officials said President Hosni Mubarak had rejected Mr. Clinton's suggestion for a summit meeting by the end of this week. They said that an eventual meeting was not ruled out, but that Mr. Mubarak had explained in a letter to Mr. Clinton that Egypt could not take part until Israel accepted an international inquiry and withdrew troops from Palestinian territories.</p>
        <p>After the release of about 20 members of Islamic fundamentalist groups from Palestinian prisons, Mr. Barak said today that he had instructed security and intelligence officials to prepare for the possibility of terrorist attacks. ''I call on the public to be alert,'' he added.</p>
        <p>A senior Israeli intelligence officer said Islamic groups believed that they have been given ''a blinking yellow light'' to renew terrorism.</p>
        <p>But Palestinian officials said Mr. Barak was overreacting to a prison release that was ordered by Palestinian judges because the men were being held without charges.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Mr. Clinton said today, ''Things are most explosive in the Middle East when both sides feel victimized.'' He insisted, however, that both sides were now taking responsibility for their actions.</p>
        <p>Still, the public relations machines that both have cranked up continued to trade blame.</p>
        <p>Each side accuses the other of starting and perpetuating the violence and of preventing a return to negotiations. The Palestinians excoriate Israeli troops for killing a disproportionate number of children, while the Israelis say the Palestinians are responsible for putting their children in harm's way. All but about five of the dead have been Arabs.</p>
        <p>Foreign diplomats, led by Secretary General Annan, have been trying to reconcile the Palestinian demand for a broadly international inquiry into the violence and an Israeli proposal for a fact-finding team of Israelis, Palestinians and Americans with a Norwegian observer. ''What do you have to hide?'' Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, asked an Israeli official.</p>
        <p>A senior Israeli security official said: ''What the Palestinians are looking for is not a fact-finding mission. It's an international kangaroo court.''</p>
        <p>Despite today's casualties, the violence has tapered off this week. Israeli officials insist that Mr. Arafat gave orders to street lieutenants to cool the riots.</p>
        <p>But the senior lieutenant, Marwan Barghouti, said in an interview that the uprising was still on, with Mr. Arafat's blessing. Mr. Barghouti said the Palestinian leader had requested that the conflict not escalate only in order to protect civilians.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Mr. Barak gave Mr. Arafat a 48-hour deadline to quell the violence or face fuller force or economic sanctions on the Palestinians. On Monday, at the urging of the Americans and others, he extended the deadline indefinitely to avoid worsening the conflict. ''Barak had climbed up into a tree, and they helped him down,'' a diplomat said.</p>
        <p>But the prime minister has come under fire from right-wing opponents for backing away from his ultimatum. They say he damaged Israel's credibility as a military power and broke a national tradition of standing behind such threats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak called on Ariel Sharon, the right-wing opposition leader, to consider joining his government. But Mr. Sharon announced that he would not join forces with Mr. Barak, who, in abandoning his ultimatum, appeared ready to return to the peace table if the violence ebbs.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Barak, who gave full ministerial posts to several acting ministers today, noticeably failed to make permanent Shlomo Ben-Ami's temporary job as acting foreign minister. It is believed that he is keeping that portfolio free to offer it to Mr. Sharon.</p>
        <p>In the West Bank, many young Jewish settlers see themselves as engaged in a God-given mission, one risky enough to warrant making plans for their own funerals. That was the case with the 37-year-old yeshiva student whose funeral was held today. Hillel Lieberman had  asked to be buried near the graves of two other yeshiva students killed in a terrorist attack two years ago.</p>
        <p>An army-escorted convoy of buses and cars proceeded this afternoon to the funeral, of a man who many mourners believed died trying to protect a Jewish religious site. Mr. Lieberman was abducted and slain  after setting out on Saturday to walk the three miles from his settlement to Nablus, where he heard that Palestinians were burning a shrine called Joseph's Tomb.</p>
        <p>Stones pelted the funeral convoy.  The settlers, automatic weapons slung over their shoulders, quickly left their vehicles and started throwing stones back and then shooting into the air, witnesses said. The Israeli radio said Israeli soldiers had quickly intervened, taking the shooting into their own hands. But one mourner complained that the soldiers had first ''fled like girls.''</p>
        <p>The scene developed into a raging gun battle, with Israeli tanks firing machine guns and helicopters hovering. Sporadic gunfire continued through the evening.</p>
