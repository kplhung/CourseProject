        <p>The PBS series ''Mystery!'' begins its 21st season tonight with a dark gothic brew called ''The Wyvern Mystery.'' This saga of betrayal and retribution, which concludes next Thursday, was concocted in 1869 by the Irish novelist J. S. Le Fanu. Rather than displaying an antique tale's rich patina, this adaptation shines a harsh spotlight upon its rust.</p>
        <p>Still, the proceedings are enlivened by two of the leading performers. Naomi Watts glows (never sweats, even in childbirth) as Alice, the plucky heroine who grows ever stronger as horrifying obstacles are hurled willy-nilly into her path. And Sir Derek Jacobi fumes as Squire Fairfield, who is by turns Alice's foster father, would-be lover, vengeful father-in-law and more. Ms. Watts's brass restraint and Sir Derek's over-the-top emoting nearly carry the day. (There's so much scenery chewing here, by Sir Derek and others, that you wonder why no dentists are listed in the credits.) But the spark of these two adversaries is ultimately doused by the lukewarm production.</p>

        <p>The PBS series ''Mystery!'' begins its 21st season tonight with a dark gothic brew called ''The Wyvern Mystery.'' This saga of betrayal and retribution, which concludes next Thursday, was concocted in 1869 by the Irish novelist J. S. Le Fanu. Rather than displaying an antique tale's rich patina, this adaptation shines a harsh spotlight upon its rust.</p>
        <p>Still, the proceedings are enlivened by two of the leading performers. Naomi Watts glows (never sweats, even in childbirth) as Alice, the plucky heroine who grows ever stronger as horrifying obstacles are hurled willy-nilly into her path. And Sir Derek Jacobi fumes as Squire Fairfield, who is by turns Alice's foster father, would-be lover, vengeful father-in-law and more. Ms. Watts's brass restraint and Sir Derek's over-the-top emoting nearly carry the day. (There's so much scenery chewing here, by Sir Derek and others, that you wonder why no dentists are listed in the credits.) But the spark of these two adversaries is ultimately doused by the lukewarm production.</p>
        <p>The film, directed by Alex Pillai from a script by David Pirie, is a few surprises short of the witty standard that viewers have come to expect from this series's reliable imports. For all its requisite gothic elements -- drafty manor houses where evil lurks behind locked doors and smarmy smiles -- the drama never builds a head of creepy fun. Instead of keeping you on the edge of your seat, it often lulls you back on your cushion with too many standard-issue BBC views of the English countryside containing too many herds of sheep. (If dentists were listed in the credits, the shepherds would come just after them.)</p>
        <p>Here's a bit of the plot. When the virtuous Alice was a child, her father died, owing a great debt to the widowed squire, who brought the girl to live at his home, Wyvern. (Le Fanu's readers would have known that wyvern is a subspecies of dragon, and that the word foreshadowed sinister doings.) Now, some years later, Alice is a fetching young woman, and in the film's best scene, just moments into the action, the squire proposes marriage, promising ''the best settlement made on a Fairfield wife since my great-uncle's time.'' The reptilian squire plants a besotted kiss on the trap-tight lips of Alice, who escapes into the arms of her true (if secret) love, the squire's broodingly earnest son Charles (Iain Glen).</p>
        <p>With the help of Charles's brother, the devil-may-care Harry (Jack Davenport), the young lovers scamper off to a church, where they are married, and then flee before the spurned squire arrives, vowing revenge ''if I have to hunt you both down like animals.''</p>
        <p>The newlyweds land in a dumpy Fairfield family estate called Carwell. ''We're safe here, Allie,'' Charles tells her. Yeah, right. Nobody's safe in that cursed place. You can tell that from the look of barely concealed terror on the face of the housekeeper, Mrs. Tarnley (Ellie Haddington).</p>
        <p>Alice, soon pregnant and forbidden to leave her new home, begins to learn that the house has secrets. A child once drowned in a bathtub there, possibly by his father's hand. A corridor whose walls are painted black leads to a room full of dusty old clothes and scurrying bugs. Charles begins to act mysteriously, whispering to Harry about ''the old soldier'' and disappearing on unexplained errands. As tonight's episode ends, the full weight of Alice's perilous situation comes crashing down on her in the film's most chilling and confusing scene. If you get that far, you'll surely want to come back next week, if only in hope of figuring out what you already saw.</p>
        <p>All is revealed in the end, more or less, and some of the guilty are punished. But the gravest offense here is the paint-by-the-numbers storytelling. What's the point of thawing an old potboiler if it never gets past a simmer?</p>
        <p>THE WYVERN MYSTERY  PBS, tonight  (Channel 13, New York, at 9)</p>
        <p>First of two parts, to conclude next Thursday. Directed by Alex Pillai; written by David Pirie, based on the novel by J. S. Le Fanu; produced by Ruth Baumgarten. Jim Reeve, Gareth Neame and Jane Tranter, executive producers. Presented by WGBH Boston.</p>
