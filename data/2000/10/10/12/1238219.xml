        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A letter writer, Stanley J. Schaffer  (''Word's Not Perfect,'' Incoming, Oct. 5), in addressing the rivalry between Corel's WordPerfect and Microsoft Word, said that those who didn't like the ''free'' Microsoft software that came with their computers should just uninstall it. ''Most customers appreciate getting Microsoft Word and other software at no charge -- I know that I do,'' he wrote. But he isn't getting it free.</p>

        <p>A letter writer, Stanley J.

        <p>Microsoft is not a charity. It passes its software costs on to the computer manufacturers, who pass them on to consumers. Microsoft insists on bundling its software with Windows, knowing that the computers won't sell without Windows. That is a significant part of the antitrust case against Microsoft.</p>
        <p>I happen to use Microsoft Word, but I admit that WordPerfect might well be the No. 1 word processing software had Word not had the Windows monopoly behind it.</p>
