        <p>Students in New York City's private schools improved their scores sharply this year on the state's more rigorous fourth-grade reading and writing test, with 52 percent passing, compared with 43 percent last year, education officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Even more encouraging, most of the improvement was from an increase in high scores. Students pass the tests with either a Level 3, defined as ''adequate,'' or a Level 4, defined as ''excellent,'' and while the percentage of students at Level 3 remained the same, the percentage at Level 4 jumped to 11 percent, up from 3 percent.</p>

        <p>Students in New York City's private schools improved their scores sharply this year on the state's more rigorous fourth-grade reading and writing test, with 52 percent passing, compared with 43 percent last year, education officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Even more encouraging, most of the improvement was from an increase in high scores. Students pass the tests with either a Level 3, defined as ''adequate,'' or a Level 4, defined as ''excellent,'' and while the percentage of students at Level 3 remained the same, the percentage at Level 4 jumped to 11 percent, up from 3 percent.</p>
        <p>This was the second year the state offered the tougher test, and the private school students' gains were comparable with those made by public school students. Those results, announced in June, showed that 42 percent of public school students in the city passed the tests this year, compared with 33 percent last year.</p>
        <p>The tests were administered in January at thousands of public and private schools throughout the state, including 482 private schools in New York City.</p>
        <p>The tougher test was introduced to help prepare students for state graduation requirements that are being phased in over the next four years.</p>
        <p>The figures exclude students in special education who took the test.</p>
        <p>Within the results, there were enormous variations in test performance from school to school. At seven schools in the city, including Visitation Academy in Brooklyn and the Geneva School of Manhattan, all the students who took the test passed it.</p>
        <p>At other schools, almost no one passed the test. Only 1 of 37 students passed at Bnos Yakov, a private school for girls in Brooklyn. At Our Lady of Sorrows School in Queens, only 5 of 47 students passed the test.</p>
        <p>Some schools showed major improvement. Only 2 of 37 of the students at Al-Noor School in Brooklyn, or 5 percent, passed last year, for example, while this year 29 of 50 students, or 58 percent, passed. Other schools showed declines. At St. Mark's Day School in Brooklyn, 20 of the 42 students who took the test, or 48 percent, passed this year, compared with 75 percent last year. Because relatively few students took the test in many schools, the individual school statistics are more likely to fluctuate heavily.</p>
        <p>The overall improvements were found in every borough. In Staten Island, 65 percent of students passed the test, an increase of 11 percentage points from the 54 percent who passed last year. In Queens, 58 percent of students passed, up from 48 percent.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, 46 percent of students passed, up from 37 percent. In Brooklyn, 51 percent passed, up from 42 percent. And in the Bronx, 42 percent passed, up from 34 percent last year.</p>
        <p>The test, which is not mandatory, was not given at every private school in the city. Most of the elite private schools in Manhattan dropped out of the state's testing program last year, saying that they value their privacy, are opposed to ranking schools against one another and would rather have parents decide where to send their children based on other factors.</p>
