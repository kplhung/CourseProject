        <p>On the night the Rangers celebrated their 75-year history, the franchise's most popular player seized the moment as he has done so often in his brilliant 23-year career.</p>
        <p>Twenty-four seconds into the final period, Mark Messier scored the game-winning goal in the Rangers' 3-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens at a raucous Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''It couldn't have been any better,'' Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, said. ''It was like a hockey god in the sky scripted it for us. It was a dramatic night for New York Rangers fans.''</p>
        <p>Messier's goal may not have been as dramatic as the hat-trick tally he recorded against the Devils in Game 6 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, or the goal he scored in Game 7 of the finals against the Vancouver Canucks to win the Stanley Cup. But it was surely as momentous as the goal Messier had scored at the Garden in 1997 as a member of the Canucks.</p>
        <p>''This was much better,'' Messier said. ''The home team won. And there's nothing like scoring the winning goal at home.''</p>
        <p>No one had done so for the Rangers in a home opener since 1995-96, the last season they won their first game at the Garden. The Rangers are two games over .500 for the first time since the last game of the 1996-97 season, Messier's last with the team. The last time the Rangers opened a season with consecutive victories was in 1989-90.</p>
        <p>''Not much of a coincidence,'' Brian Leetch said.</p>
        <p>No matter that the victories came over Atlanta and Montreal, two struggling teams. It was almost as if the Rangers had been waiting three years for Messier to return.</p>
        <p>''I actually was a little bit nervous,'' Messier said. ''I couldn't believe it. I've played in a lot of big games.''</p>
        <p>Adam Graves laughed and said, ''I saw him fall one time in the corner, and he never falls down.''</p>
        <p>It did not take long for Messier to regain his composure.</p>
        <p>''A lot of guys are going to feed off his emotions,'' Coach Ron Low said. ''It was something they badly needed here last season, apparently. I don't think we're going to be lacking in emotion this year.''</p>
        <p>Messier was not the only Rangers star; he wasn't even the first star of the night. Radek Dvorak scored twice, once on the power play in the second period to open the scoring and once at even strength midway through the third to put the game away. And Kirk McLean, who is the No. 1 goaltender until Mike Ricther (out with a reconstructed left knee) is cleared to play, had his second strong outing of the season, making 28 saves.</p>
        <p>But no matter how many Rangers Hall of Famers walked onto the ice during the stirring pregame festivities, this was Messier's night. The shaved head, the glare, the jutted jaw, the blue sweater with the captain's ''C'' and the ''11'' stitched on, the broad smile that would surreptitiously break out.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't surprised,'' Leetch said. ''He seems to come up with something in every big moment. I knew he'd be on the score sheet. And I figured it would probably be a goal.''  Graves said: ''Mark has a knack of scoring the big goal at the right time. Tonight was no exception.''</p>
        <p>Even if Messier's goal was a centering pass intended for Graves that pinballed off Montreal defenseman Eric Weinrich's knee pad and between goalie Jeff Hackett's legs.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-three years later, it's always nice to score a goal,'' Messier said with a laugh. ''It doesn't matter how they go in.''</p>
        <p>For Messier, last night was not only a reminder of how good things were during his six seasons in New York but also showed promise of how good the team could be again.</p>
        <p>Last season, the team's goal was to make the playoffs. That failed miserably. This season, both Messier and Sather have made it clear that the only goal is to win the Stanley Cup, no matter how unrealistic that might seem.</p>
        <p>''Without lofty goals, I don't think you ever put yourself in a position to be successful,'' Messier said.</p>
        <p>When he first skated out onto the Garden ice to cap a pregame ceremony that included the introductions of Ranger greats, Messier was treated to a two-minute standing ovation, replete with chants of ''Messier! Messier! Messier!''</p>
        <p>After goal No. 628 of Messier's career was announced over the public address system, the Garden was again filled with the chants. ''Messier! Messier! Messier!</p>
        <p>The Rangers were up, 2-0. Messier was home.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The Rangers' first four goals this season came on the power play. Last season, the Rangers went 9 for their first 112 on the power play. Through two games this season, they are 4 for 12. . . . CRAIG RIVET scored Montreal's only goal. But the Canadiens went 0 for 7 on the power play. Through two games, the Rangers have killed all 13 power plays they have faced. . . . In VLADIMIR MALAKHOV'S absence (sore knee), Rangers Coach RON LOW paired KIM JOHNSSON with BRAD BROWN, and he was impressed with Brown's play. ''He reminds me an awful lot of Beuk,'' Low said, referring to the former Rangers defenseman JEFF BEUKEBOOM. ''With a little bit better foot speed, maybe.''</p>
