        <p>A pair of German developers has won the bidding war for the Seagram Building, the latest in a series of trophy properties changing hands in a frenzied Manhattan real estate marketplace.</p>
        <p>The iconic bronze and topaz glass skyscraper on Park Avenue joins such other prime properties as Rockefeller Center, the Chrysler Building, the World Trade Center and CBS's Black Rock on what has become a crowded auction block. Some real estate brokers say that the rash of offerings is an indication that some landlords and investors are cashing out at what they believe is the peak of a four-year-old real estate boom.</p>
        <p>The Seagram Building, a 38-story landmark at 52nd Street and Park Avenue, is being sold to Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs. The two agreed yesterday to buy the building from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association for more than $375 million, according to executives involved in the deal.</p>
        <p>The new owners, the executives say, can make lots of money, but they are unlikely to reap the windfall profits of those who bought property cheap during the recession in the early and mid-1990's and then saw rents nearly double in recent years as the economy surged.</p>
        <p>That did not prevent Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs from topping a rival bidder, Jerry I. Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, by more than $12 million, according to real estate executives.</p>
        <p>''Many people think the market is either at the top or slightly past the top,'' said John D. Lyons, chief executive of Granite Partners, a real estate investment bank. ''So owners are asking for and obtaining premium prices.''</p>
        <p>Philip R. DiGennaro, managing director of T.I.A.A., said he was optimistic he would close the deal for the Seagram Building very soon, but he declined to name the buyer. The broker that handled the auction, Insignia/ESG, did not return calls requesting comment.</p>
        <p>If the deal closes, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs, who head RFR Holding, would own the two great postwar glass skyscrapers on Park Avenue. Only 14 months ago, RFR Holding bought the landmark Lever House, the 21-story skyscraper that sits across the street from the Seagram Building at 390 Park Avenue. The building was the first glass-walled office tower built in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs moved to New York in the late 1980's from Frankfurt and began buying real estate in 1991, as the market collapsed. In a relatively short time, they have accumulated a portfolio of 16 office buildings and a dozen apartment houses worth nearly $2 billion.</p>
        <p>Built in 1958 at a cost of $41 million, the Seagram Building is the only skyscraper in New York designed by Mies van der Rohe, the prince of International Style architecture, and Philip Johnson, who was then his acolyte. The architect was given an unlimited budget for the project at the urging of Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of Samuel Bronfman, Seagram's chairman.</p>
        <p>The Seagram Building was the most expensive office tower of its day. And it is still an expensive gem. The bronze exterior of the building is oiled once a year by hand and the terrazzo floors in the elevator lobbies are polished once a month.</p>
        <p>But the Seagram Building is not the only trophy on the block. After Rockefeller Center was put up for sale earlier this year, a half-dozen other major office towers suddenly followed suit, each owner hoping to make a huge profit.</p>
        <p>''There may be an unusual number of big buildings up for sale,'' said Darcy Stacom, a broker at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, ''but there are an awful lot of interested buyers.''</p>
        <p>Equitable Life Assurance Society and Nippon Life Insurance of Japan hired Cushman &amp; Wakefield to sell the 42-story PaineWebber Building at the Avenue of the Americas and 52nd Street, and CBS is seeking offers for its 38-story black granite skyscraper at 51 West 52nd Street.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is examining seven bids ranging up to $3 billion for a 99-year lease of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Last month, Goldman Sachs &amp; Company's Whitehall fund, the principal owner of Rockefeller Center, winnowed the list of bidders for the historic 12-building complex to the Fisher real estate family; Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties; Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust; and Sam Zell, chairman of Equity Office Properties. Goldman and its partners, which include Mr. Speyer, bought the seven million-square-foot complex for $1.2 billion and are hoping to sell it for more than $2 billion, although some analysts say the price may be too high.</p>
        <p>Mr. Speyer and Travelers Group are also selling, or refinancing, the landmark Chrysler Building on 42nd Street. The partners bought the mortgage for the 1.9 million-square-foot Art Deco complex almost three years ago for $220 million, then spent $100 million on renovations. They now put the value of the property as high as $800 million.</p>
        <p>According to Granite Partners, the average sale price for Midtown office buildings has risen to almost $300 a square foot, from about $150 a square foot in 1997. Buyers are willing to pay even more for landmark buildings whose cachet often translates into higher rents. At the Lever House, for instance, rents are close to $100 a square foot, $35 higher than the average asking rent in Midtown. And very little vacant office space is available today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''The underlying market shows no signs of letting up,'' said Robert A. Sass, director of real estate investment at GVA Williams.</p>
        <p>But with interest rates rising, technology stocks faltering and the economy starting to slow, many analysts expect rents to rise more slowly and profits to be more modest, said Mr. Lyons of Granite Partners.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs expect to take advantage of the fact that nearly three-quarters of the leases in the Seagram Building will expire in the next five years. With rents in the building at about half the average in Midtown today, the new owners expect to raise rents quickly.</p>
        <p>''If the market continues at this rate, it's an absolute home run,'' said one person involved in the negotiations. ''If it doesn't, there's tremendous risk.''</p>
