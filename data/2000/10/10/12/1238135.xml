        <p>Sri Lanka's governing coalition, headed by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, led the main opposition party in parliamentary elections late today. But neither side had a clear majority. The final results are to be available on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The possibility that the governing People's Alliance or the opposition United National Party would emerge with a resounding victory faded as results for two-thirds of the 225 seats were released, giving the alliance 88 to the opposition's 72. The remainder went to smaller parties.</p>
        <p>Short of a landslide for one or the other, it was difficult to see what would break their stalemate over how to end the 17-year-old civil war with separatist Tamil rebels, which has taken more than 60,000 lives.</p>
        <p>Though Mrs. Kumaratunga and the United National leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, agree that there has to be a political settlement of Tamil grievances and share extensive common ground on the details of a solution, they have been unable to rally behind a bipartisan approach. For 50 years, Mrs. Kumaratunga's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the dominant force in the governing alliance, and its fierce United National rivals have alternated in power. The recent weeks of tough campaigning are highly unlikely to have made them any more eager to cooperate with each other.</p>
        <p>The election was marred by reports of fraud, murder and bombings. Election Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said on state television tonight that the results of the election on Tuesday had been delayed until Thursday because voting in all of the northern Kilinochchi district and some polling centers in the south had been annulled because of fraud and violence.</p>
        <p>''Please be patient,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The alliance and United National leaders have begun wooing allies among the smaller parties in the event of a hung Parliament in which neither has a majority. A leader of a smaller party, the Tamil United Liberation Front, which won five seats, said it would definitely not join the alliance because it had supported another Tamil party in the campaign, nor would it join the United National, which it considers worse.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't touch the People's Alliance with a barge pole,'' said V. Anandasangaree, a new member of Parliament from the party.</p>
