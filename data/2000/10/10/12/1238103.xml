        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I take issue with an Oct. 11 letter saying that overturning Roe v. Wade would not end a woman's right to choose.</p>
        <p>In fact, the overturning of Roe would transfer the right of choice to politicians, who would exercise it based on the success of various electoral strategies. Some women would retain the ability to have an abortion, either pursuant to the law of their state or in avoidance of that law through travel or other means.</p>
        <p>No American woman would have a right to reproductive self-determination, unless guaranteed by her state constitution. Since the right does not travel with her, she would have to be at home to be sure of exercising that right.</p>
        <p>MAE KUYKENDALL  East Lansing, Mich., Oct. 11, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor at Michigan State University-Detroit College of Law.</p>
