        <p>Aspen and other Colorado ski resorts face worker shortage as high housing costs drive out workers; some struggle to recruit workers abroad (M)</p>

        <p>Here in the crown jewel of Colorado's ski resorts, no one really asks who wants to be a millionaire. Many residents and visitors already are. Far more important questions around town include: Who wants to be a housekeeper? Who wants to be a waiter? And who wants to be a retail clerk?</p>

        <p>Here in the crown jewel of Colorado's ski resorts, no one really asks who wants to be a millionaire. Many residents and visitors already are. Far more important questions around town include: Who wants to be a housekeeper? Who wants to be a waiter? And who wants to be a retail clerk?</p>
        <p>Few places in the country reflect an unintended dark side of the nation's prosperity more than Colorado resort areas like Aspen, where labor shortages are sending employers as far as Europe, Africa and Australia to recruit workers essential to the viability of the area. Here, for example, a vacationer is just as likely to be greeted at a restaurant with ''G'day, mate'' as ''Good morning, sir.''</p>
        <p>''Given the robust nature of the economy, there is a general shortage of people in the resort counties, here as well as nationwide,'' said Jim Westkott, Colorado's state demographer, who attributes the labor problems to a rapid growth in tourism, the increasing number of second and third homes built in ski resort areas and the soaring real estate market. In many of Colorado's ski towns, a modest single-family house with three or four bedrooms sells for $1 million or more.</p>
        <p>As a result, working people who earn hourly wages selling clothes, waiting on tables and operating ski lifts can no longer afford to live near their jobs. In the last few years, many of them have been forced to find more affordable housing 30 to 60 miles away, creating monstrous rush-hour traffic jams, polluting the air and undermining the quality of life of workers, especially those who long to spend more time with their children.</p>
        <p>But now, state and resort-area officials say, workers fed up with long commutes and traffic are beginning to abandon their resort jobs to find work closer to home, leaving huge vacuums at the resorts, some of which are seeking to hire hundreds of new workers this season.</p>
        <p>It has become an especially burdensome task, even as some resort towns, like Aspen, are now requiring developers to build affordable housing for workers as a condition of building expensive single-family houses.</p>
        <p>While the nation's unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in August, matching a 30-year record, the rate fell even lower in some of Colorado's prime ski counties: to 1.9 percent in Summit, where Copper Mountain is; 1.5 percent in Pitkin, where Aspen is; and 1.4 percent in Eagle, where Vail is. (August is the last month for which statistics have been compiled.)</p>
        <p>It is no longer enough to post ''Now Hiring'' signs in storefronts or to list job offerings in the local newspapers, as many employers still do. More and more of them, including those at Crested Butte, Copper Mountain and Vail, have sent representatives to job fairs in other states and in foreign countries, offering recruits subsidized housing, hourly wages well above the minimum wage, comprehensive health care packages and free season passes to the slopes.</p>
        <p>David Barry, chief operating officer for Copper Mountain, said his resort had worked with employment agencies that had brought in new workers from the Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Australia and New Zealand. Among their benefits is a program for subsidized meals that cost $3 each.</p>
        <p>Les Marsh, director of human resources for Vail Resorts, which owns the Vail, Keystone, Breckenridge and Beaver Creek ski areas, said his company had used offers of subsidized housing at recent job fairs in Massachusetts, Virginia, Texas, Oregon and Washington. The company has also dropped its program of drug-testing for all new employees.</p>
        <p>Employers at Winter Park get an end-of-season bonus, $1 for every hour they worked.</p>
        <p>For many of the new workers, the  chance to work in a glittery ski resort is more than a dream job; many say it also enhances their resumes for a future higher-paying job at home or in the United States.</p>
        <p>''It's more expensive to live here, but the pay and benefits are twice as good as for the same job back home,'' said Jac O'Sullivan, a 32-year-old native of Manchester, England, who has worked in the banquet department of the Little Nell Hotel in Aspen for 16 months. She is one of about 30 of the hotel employees who are from other countries.</p>
        <p>Sam Reid, 26, who moved to Aspen from London last year, is training in the hotel's food and beverage department. ''If it wasn't Aspen, it could be another state,'' she said. ''The working conditions here are really good. You are treated better, and they do look after you better.''</p>
        <p>For ski towns in Colorado as well as in other Rocky Mountain states, providing a full range of quality service has taken on a new urgency after unusually warm autumns have contributed to a two-year decline in skiing and snowboarding.</p>
        <p>''Colorado is anxious to regain some growth and momentum after the past two years,'' said David Perry, president and chief executive of Colorado Ski Country, a trade organization that represents 25 resorts. ''But with the strong economy, it has become very difficult to find people for service and entry-level type jobs, and everybody is competing for those people. We'd like to get more of them and get them faster.''</p>
