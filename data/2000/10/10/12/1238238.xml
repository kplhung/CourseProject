        <p>Delphi Automotive Systems and Palm Inc. have announced plans to develop MobileAria, a system that will bring voice-activated Internet and phone access to automobiles. The Mayfield Fund, a venture capital company, has also invested in the system. Terms of the three companies' investments in the new system were not disclosed. The hardware for MobileAria, which is expected to be available early next year, includes a docking station that will accommodate Palm hand-held computers and Ericsson cell phones. Voice activation software will let users operate both kinds of devices. The software will also read back Internet and Palm information. John Shea, a spokesman for Delphi, said the company planned to make the system compatible with a range of wireless phones.</p>
