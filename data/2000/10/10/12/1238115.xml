        <p>The United States Court of Appeals announced a schedule today that would bring the two sides in the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust appeal back into the courtroom at the end of February.</p>
        <p>The court ordered Microsoft to file its first appeals brief by Nov. 27, with the government's reply due by Jan. 12. Final briefs are due on Feb. 9, and arguments are set for Feb. 26 and 27.</p>

        <p>The United States Court of Appeals announced a schedule today that would bring the two sides in the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust appeal back into the courtroom at the end of February.</p>
        <p>The court ordered Microsoft to file its first appeals brief by Nov. 27, with the government's reply due by Jan. 12. Final briefs are due on Feb. 9, and arguments are set for Feb. 26 and 27.</p>
        <p>The timetable reflected a compromise. Microsoft had sought at least five months to file documents, and the government had pressed for a faster review that would have had the filing period ending in late December.</p>
        <p>In June, a federal district judge found Microsoft to have violated antitrust laws and ordered it to be broken in two. Last month the Supreme Court refused to consider a direct appeal, as the government had sought, and sent the case to the appeals court.</p>
        <p>Some analysts have suggested that Microsoft wants to draw out the legal battle in the hope of getting a more sympathetic ear in the White House if George W. Bush takes over the presidency in January. The Justice Department's case, which will be heard by a panel of seven appellate judges, will ultimately be supervised by the next administration. Nineteen states are also plaintiffs in the case.</p>
        <p>Both sides said today that they were satisfied with the schedule.</p>
        <p>Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, called the schedule ''fair and reasonable.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''We remain very confident of our case on appeal and believe the district court's judgment will be reversed due to the wide array of legal, factual and procedural errors.''</p>
        <p>Chris Watney, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said, ''The schedule is a reasonable one, and we look forward to presenting our case.''</p>
        <p>The appeals court also took a middle road on the length of the briefs to be filed. Microsoft had asked to submit a brief four times the length the court normally allows, and the government sought less than half that. The court limited Microsoft's first brief to 150 pages and gave the government 125 pages to reply. States that have sued separately may add 25 pages to that brief. At 250 words a page, the two sides will thus have roughly 37,500 words each to make their cases.</p>
