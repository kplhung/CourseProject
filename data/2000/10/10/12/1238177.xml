        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>ALBANY: STATE GETS WEST NILE MONEY  The Clinton administration has sent New York State $5 million in emergency financing for costs associated with fighting the West Nile virus, said Senator Charles E. Schumer, who lobbied for the aid. The money, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will be used to reimburse cities for 75 percent of the cost of mosquito spraying. The Giuliani administration was less than satisfied with the federal government offer, noting that the $5 million in statewide assistance would mean that only a tiny piece of the city's expected $15 million in West Nile-related costs this year would be covered. ''It is too little too late,'' said Sunny Mindel, press secretary to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. ''It is woefully inadequate.''  One person in New Jersey died and 14 people in New York were sickened after being infected with the West Nile virus this year.</p>

The man, Andre Carmichael, left, said that his older sister, Sabrina Yaw, had once told him that in 1979 she saw their mother, Madeline Carmichael, and their brother, Gregory Carmichael, killing their 3-year-old sister, Latanisha Carmichael. Madeline and Gregory Carmichael have said that Latanisha's death was an accident.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: TEENAGER STABBED ON BUS  A 13-year-old boy was stabbed in the chest by a 12-year-old boy on a school bus in Brooklyn yesterday, the police said. The victim's wounds were minor. A school safety officer arrested the younger boy when the bus arrived at Intermediate School 57, where the two boys are special-education students, the police said. Charges were pending against the assailant, whose name was not released because of his age, the police said. The victim was taken to St. Mary's Brooklyn Hospital, where he was treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said.</p>

        <p>BRONX: 3 ARRESTED FOLLOWING CRASH  Two Bronx men waylaid and beat a 15-year-old boy who they believed could lead them to a suspect in a fatal hit-and-run car accident, the police said. The men were charged with kidnapping and assault yesterday in connection with the incident, the police said. The authorities said that on Tuesday the two men, Steven Torres, 21, and Hemerigildo Torres, 40, lent their 1988 Honda to Miguel Medrano, 21, who fatally struck a 61-year-old woman with the car at the Grand Concourse. After detectives asked the Torreses , whose relationship was not immediately known, whether their car was involved in a crime, , the men found a 15-year-old friend of Mr. Medrano's and beat him, demanding to know the suspect's whereabouts. Mr. Medrano was already in police custody, charged with leaving the scene of an accident.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: RALLY FOR MORE POLICE  Saying that crime in their neighborhood had persisted as the number of officers dwindled in recent years, scores of residents of Sunnyside, Long Island City, Woodside and Maspeth demonstrated in Sunnyside for more uniformed officers  yesterday. Don McCallian, co-chairman of the Community Action Coalition, a neighborhood group formed in 1997 to lobby for more police officers, said that in 1998 the city cut the precinct's uniformed officers to 136 from 200. Detective Walter Burnes, a Police Department spokesman, said precincts were constantly re-evaluated to assess the need for staffing changes.</p>

        <p>PRESCRIPTION DRUG SURVEY  Prescription drugs cost twice as much for people without insurance as they do for patients enrolled in insurance plans that negotiate bulk discounts with drug companies, according to a survey of 12 markets around the country, including New Jersey and New York. In New York, the cost is 112 percent higher for the uninsured, while in New Jersey it is 88 percent higher, according to the survey conducted by Public Citizen, based in Washington.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: H.M.O.'S TREAT FEWER PATIENTS  New Jersey health maintenance organizations treat a smaller percentage of their patients than H.M.O.'s in other states in eight categories of preventive health care, according to a new study. After studying data from the state's 10 largest H.M.O.'s and 440 others around the country, the Department of Health and Senior Services reported that the H.M.O.'s nationwide provided mammograms to 73 percent of women from ages 52 to 69, while the state's H.M.O.'s  provided them to 65 percent. The gap was similar in tests for cervical cancer.</p>

        <p>NEW LONDON: MURDER TRIAL STAYS  A Superior Court judge has rejected a request to move the trial of a lawyer charged in the 1994 shooting death of her brother-in-law. The judge, Susan B. Handy, ruled that a fair trial was possible despite intense news coverage of the case. The lawyer, Beth Ann Carpenter, 36, faces capital murder and conspiracy charges. She is accused of plotting with her lover and former law partner, Haiman Clein, in paying a hit man $10,000 to kill her brother-in-law, Anson  Clinton 3rd. Prosecutors say Ms. Carpenter believed her brother-in-law was molesting her 3-year-old niece. Mr. Clein and the hit man, Mark Despres, have pleaded guilty to murder and are awaiting sentencing.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: 7TH OFFICER IN SEX SCANDAL  A seventh Hartford police officer has been charged with on-duty sexual misconduct involving city prostitutes. The officer, Julio Camacho, 40, of Cromwell, was charged yesterday with violating the civil rights of two prostitutes, said the United States attorney, Stephen C. Robinson. The indictment maintains that in 1995 and 1997, Officer Camacho coerced two women into his cruiser, drove them to a secluded area and forced them to have sex with him. Five officers have either pleaded guilty or been convicted, and one is to be tried later this month.</p>
