        <p>Lightning thinks Thunder has not been getting enough chances to make noise.</p>
        <p>Theories abound at Giants Stadium when it comes to fixing the Giants' failing offense, but running back Tiki Barber believes the remedy begins with increased opportunity for his backfield counterpart, Ron Dayne.</p>
        <p>''We need to get Ron the football more often,'' Barber said after today's practice. ''He's the pounder. I'm not going to wear defenses down by running at them over and over. Our regular offense has a big role for Ron. But we haven't been able to stay regular.</p>
        <p>''We've got to find a way to do that, so Ron can be productive, which is essential if the offense is going to be productive.''</p>
        <p>Unspoken, especially by the prideful Barber, is that the Giants need Dayne, their 256-pound running back, to handle most of the rushing attempts instead of Barber, their 198-pound back. Barber, who also returns punts, could be wearing down; he sustained a minor knee strain last month and injured an ankle in Sunday's victory over Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Dayne, the team's first-round draft pick and last season's Heisman Trophy winner, has yet to have a breakout game. But during the Giants' 3-0 start, he complemented Barber with an average of 21 carries and 65.1 rushing yards a game. Since then, he has averaged 6.7 carries and 17.7 yards a game.</p>
        <p>The Giants' use of Dayne has grown irregular, something that the coaching staff has blamed on adverse game situations, which is to say: losing. But one thing seems certain: while the Giants once envisioned Dayne as a workhorse, he has lately seen something closer to spot duty.</p>
        <p>All offensive football discussions eventually become chicken-and-the egg debates. Has Dayne's productivity been down because he has not been getting enough carries? Or, is Dayne not getting carries because his production has been down?</p>
        <p>The discussion about Dayne, averaging 3 yards a carry, has followed that path. Dayne, aware that rookies are not supposed to have strong opinions, stays out of the debate.</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel, meanwhile, stopped short of conceding that Dayne's role might expand. He did not want to tip his hand to the Dallas Cowboys (2-3), who come to Giants Stadium on Sunday. Fassel, however, did not dispute that 20 punishing carries by Dayne might stabilize an offense groping to find its rhythm.</p>
        <p>But Fassel has also been busy fielding questions about the other half-dozen things going wrong with the Giants' offense.</p>
        <p>Many of those questions have been about the Giants' disappearing passing attack. Wide receivers Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard, who flourished during the early winning streak, combined for 3 catches and 42 receiving yards this past Sunday. How to fix the passing game is almost as thorny a debate as what to do with the running game.</p>
        <p>In the locker room today, for example, when the team's offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, was asked if Toomer's role could be diminishing, Payton answered: ''If anything, we're going to throw to him more. He's like a good 3-point shooter. We're going to keep shooting 3-pointers.''</p>
        <p>About an hour later, here was how Fassel responded to a similar question: ''I talked to Amani about that. Don't think that we're just going to keep throwing it until you finally make a big play. You're going to have to show that you can do that.''</p>
        <p>For Fassel, who is enduring a fourth season in which his offense is being dissected and second-guessed, the inherent paradox of trying to achieve an offensive balance with disparate talents is becoming old hat. Today, almost in exasperation, he said he could not make every player happy. But he confidently predicted that Toomer, Hilliard, tight end Pete Mitchell -- who has only 4 catches -- and quarterback Kerry Collins would have successful 2000 seasons.</p>
        <p>And balance is every modern offense's goal. But since the Giants have not shown that they can set up the running game by passing, it may be time to set up the passing game by running. Especially because Dallas ranks last in the National Football League in rushing defense.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Linebacker MIKE BARROW, who sat out the Giants' last game with a pinched nerve in his neck, practiced on Wednesday, as did defensive tackle KEITH HAMILTON, who injured a knee on Sunday. . . . Coach JIM FASSEL has not decided whether BRAD DALUISO, who missed Sunday's game with a back strain, or JARET HOLMES will be his place-kicker on Sunday.</p>
