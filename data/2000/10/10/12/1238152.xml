        <p>Henry Yuen, chairman of Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., will outline today the details of his bid to make his company's technology the dominant format for electronic publishing. The goal is to become the central distributor, bookstore and bookshelf for anyone who reads electronic books, but the scale of his ambitions has already stirred some anxieties about his potential power in the fledgling market.</p>
        <p>Gemstar is one of three principal contenders in the business of making digital texts secure from piracy and making reading on a screen easy on the eyes. Its competitors, Microsoft and Adobe Systems Inc., employ software for computers. Gemstar is the only company with a format for portable electronic-book readers.</p>
        <p>Gemstar is announcing agreements today to make books, magazines and newspapers from a number of publishers available for its format. Devices using Gemstar's technology will go on sale at electronics retailers at Thanksgiving, for prices starting around $300.</p>
        <p>Gemstar's format appeals to publishers because of its relative security from piracy. Consumers dial directly to Gemstar's computer server from modems inside the devices. The appliances do not communicate with computers or the Internet, so it is harder for hackers to make the contents public over the Web.</p>
        <p>But downloading books exclusively from the Gemstar server raises other concerns. Gemstar asks for a much higher portion of the revenue from selling electronic books than its competitors do, which could absorb much of the savings from paperless distribution. Also, Gemstar will sell electronic books directly to consumers via their hand-held devices, potentially sidestepping bookstores.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Yuen said his business would not threaten online booksellers, who he hopes will sell electronic books for his format.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yuen said Gemstar would make its money primarily ''as a distributor,'' buying electronic books from publishers and selling them to online bookstores for about 15 percent to 20 percent more. Publishers said Gemstar's charges were much higher than the roughly 3 percent commissions on the sale of electronic books in rival formats.</p>
        <p>Gemstar will also provide free digital bookshelf space -- having downloaded a book once from its server, customers can get it again whenever they want. Mr. Yuen said Gemstar might sell advertising that would greet readers when they visited its site for their books. He said the company would not put advertisements in books.</p>
        <p>Storing electronic books on the Gemstar server will also help retain those readers' future business, a situation that bothers some people. Paul Aiken, executive director of the Authors Guild, a trade group representing writers, said, ''The fear of piracy will drive publishers to accept a proprietary standard like this, and once someone is in that position they are locked in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yuen denied he was immune from competition. ''My only barrier to entry is staying a step ahead by offering a better reading experience,'' he said.</p>
