        <p>''You know, there are times when I'm standing there, watching those fluids start to flow and wonder whether what we're doing here is right,'' says Jim Willett, the warden of the Walls, the maximum-security prison in Huntsville, Tex., that contains the state's death house.

        <p>''You know, there are times when I'm standing there, watching those fluids start to flow and wonder whether what we're doing here is right,'' says Jim Willett, the warden of the Walls, the maximum-security prison in Huntsville, Tex., that contains the state's death house. Mr. Willett, who became warden in May 1998, has overseen 75 executions by lethal injection, and the job has taken its toll. ''It's something I'll think about for the rest of my life,'' he says.</p>
        <p>The troubled humanity in Mr. Willett's words and voice is likely to come as a surprise to people on both sides of the death penalty issue. Those against may not be able to comprehend how such a compassionate-sounding man can give the signal (by taking off his glasses) that it's time for the executioners to let the deadly chemicals flow. Proponents will be startled to hear the genuine pain in Mr. Willet's voice as he describes in intimate detail the process by which state employees lawfully kill a human being.</p>
        <p>Mr. Willett, who has worked at Huntsville for 29 years, is the unlikely narrator of ''Witness to an Execution,'' a radio documentary that allows prison guards, chaplains, reporters and executioners to explain what it is like to be active participants in capital punishment. This haunting 22-minute excursion into a dark and mysterious place will be broadcast today during NPR's ''All Things Considered'' (WNYC-AM/820 and WNYC-FM/93.9).</p>
        <p>''It's kind of hard to explain what you actually feel when you talk to a man and you kind of get to know that person,'' says Maj. Kenneth Dean, who is a member of the ''tie-down'' team at Huntsville. Each member of the tie-down team is responsible for strapping down a particular part of the prisoner's body before execution. Major Dean's assignment is usually the left leg.</p>
        <p>''It's a very unique job,'' says Major Dean, after 120 executions. ''Not many people are willing to do this or can do this.''</p>
        <p>''Witness to an Execution'' reminds you how powerful just listening can be, something easy to forget in a culture dominated by visual imagery, whether on television, the Internet or in movies. Pictures tell one story; voices tell another, which is why radio isn't obsolete yet. By the end of this emotionally charged piece you may feel that you have had a glimpse into the souls of strangers, though you haven't seen their faces.</p>
        <p>Provoking that sensation is the specialty of David Isay, who produced this documentary with Stacy Abramson. In the past 12 years, the 34-year-old Mr. Isay has won much acclaim for his radio broadcasts about outsiders and the underprivileged, describing his work as finding ''the poetry on the edges of society.'' Ms. Abramson, 29, who did the bulk of the work on this documentary, joined Mr. Isay four years ago.</p>
        <p>Last November they were in Huntsville recording the oral histories of people scheduled to be executed soon. While they were there the prison's spokesman, Larry Fitzgerald, received a phone call informing him that a popular prisoner had been given a date for execution. ''A look of dread came over Larry's face and he says, 'This is going to be a tough one,' '' Mr. Isay recalled in an interview.</p>
        <p>On the way back to New York, Mr. Isay said, he said to Ms. Abramson: ''I wonder what it's like for people to watch so many executions. What kind of impact does it have to participate in dozens and dozens of these things?''</p>
        <p>The next day he sent her an e-mail message suggesting they do a piece called ''Witness to an Execution.'' Because Texas had carried out more than one-third of the nation's executions -- 232 of them -- since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977, Huntsville seemed the logical place to go.</p>
        <p>Ms. Abramson began talking to people by telephone in January with the help of Mr. Fitzgerald, who often made the introductions. She went to the death row reporters, who were happy to talk, then moved on to guards and chaplains after Mr. Fitzgerald gave them the signal that it was all right to talk. In hours of interviews, everyone avoided the most obvious question: ''Do you believe in the death penalty?''</p>
        <p>The answer to that is beside the point, Ms. Abramson said. ''We just want you to know what it's like to be there, to know how it happens in that white-hot moment of life or death,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>On the program, a prison chaplain describes inmates who tell lawyer jokes just before death, and others who do calisthenics. The tie-down officers say that some people sweat, some cry and some are very polite, saying ''thank you'' to the men preparing them for execution. One reporter says it is no different from any other ''unpleasant situation'' journalists have to cover, while another questions whether he is right to make part of his income from watching people die.</p>
        <p>Most riveting is the voice of the warden, simply because of his position. When Gov. George W. Bush's office calls Huntsville and authorizes that day's execution, it is the warden who goes to the cell and says, ''It's time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Willett, reached by telephone, said he had accepted the producers' offer to have him narrate this politically sensitive documentary because  ''I thought it would be nice for it to be one of us, someone who knows what goes on back there.'' Before the documentary makers came along, he said, he could remember only one meeting -- ''at a supper, sitting around a table'' -- where the prison workers talked about what they did and how it affected them.</p>
        <p>He said his hopes for the documentary were personal, not political. ''At least people might understand and know,'' he said, ''that those of us who work back there are professional -- I hate to use the word, but that's it. That we are professional about it and that we do have feelings about what goes on back there.''</p>
