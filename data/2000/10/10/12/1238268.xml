        <p>Here's the latest accessory for the licensed pilot: a watch that doubles as a rescue beacon. The watch, the Breitling Emergency, looks like an ordinary wristwatch (that is, it looks like an ordinary wristwatch that costs several thousand dollars). But in addition to telling time, it includes a tiny transmit-ter and two antennas that can broadcast a signal to search-and-rescue crews trying to locate a downed pilot.</p>
        <p>''This gives the pilot a personal instrument to wear all the time,'' said Stefano Albinati, director of the aviation department at Breitling, the watchmaking company in Grenchen, Switzerland. ''You may forget a radio or a pen, but certainly you may not forget a watch -- especially a pilot.''</p>
        <p>Breitling has a long history of involvement in aviation, and in 1915 created a wristwatch so pilots would not have to reach into their pockets while flying. The Emergency watch (which sells for $3,500 in titanium) has plenty of features for pilots, including a stopwatch, audible time indicators, an alarm timer and a second-time-zone feature.</p>
        <p>But its when the pilot is in a fix that the $3,500 watch might really prove priceless. By twisting and pulling on a winder cap on the side of the watch  the company recommends that this be done once the pilot is on the ground  the pilot extends a coiled antenna and activates the transmitter, which will broadcast a signal on the 121.5-megahertz band, one of two used throughout the world by rescue units.</p>
        <p>In Europe, the watch has been available since 1995 to military and commercial pilots (and balloonists as well: Breitling was one of the sponsors of the first successful nonstop around-the-world balloon flight). About 5,000 have been sold. There has been at least one successful rescue, when a Swiss parachutist became separated from his squadron during a military training maneuver last year and was slightly injured in his jump. He was found relatively easily in remote terrain in a couple of hours.</p>
        <p>The watch is now available in the United States, but Breitling says that only licensed pilots are currently able to buy it. The company notes that the watch is not a plaything. The transmitter can be used only once, and if it is activated in anything other than a true emergency, Breitling will charge half the sale price to replace the antenna and transmitter. (The company will replace them free if the watch was used in a real emergency.) An unwarranted emergency signal can also mean that the sender will have to pick up the tab for any rescue operation that ensues.</p>
        <p>The watch is intended to complement similar emergency locator transmitters that all aircraft, civilian and military, are required to have on board and that are activated automatically in the event of a crash. The on-board transmitter sends a signal that can be picked up by a system of satellites and used to send a rescue crew to the approximate location of a downed plane. Breitling says the signal from the wristwatch should be picked up by receiving equipment on the rescue aircraft, helping the crew spot the pilot and passengers more easily.</p>
        <p>The idea for the watch came about when Breitlings owner, Ernest Schneider, a former transmission specialist in the Swiss Army, attended a NATO meeting and was asked to develop a watch with a locating transmitter for emergencies. It took 10 years to develop the watch in cooperation with the electronics company Dassault lectronique.</p>
        <p>The watch is only the latest bit of technology for sending distress signals. From flares and smoke signals, the technology progressed to teletypes and more sophisticated ground-based radio, then to satellite communications. With such technology, said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Steward of the United States Coast Guard in Washington,''you can basically alert somebody on the other side of the world that youre in trouble.''</p>
        <p>The satellite-based system, known as Cospas-Sar-sat (the words combine Russian and English terms for search-and-rescue satellites) was initiated in 1970 after two plane crashes.</p>
        <p>''A girl and her mother initially survived a crash, and the girl kept a log of how many planes flew overhead and never saw them,'' Commander Steward said, adding that the mother and daughter died before the plane was found. Those deaths, and a plane crash in Alaska involving two congressmen, led Congress to require emergency beacons in all aircraft.</p>
        <p>These beacons, known as E.L.T.'s, or Emergency Locator Transmitters, are one of three types used with the satellite system. The others are Emergency Position Indicating Response Beacons, or E.P.I.R.B.'s, for maritime use, and Personal Locator Beacons, or P.L.B.'s, which can used only by government or military personnel or in Alaska. They operate on the 121.5-megahertz band as well as on a 406-megahertz band.</p>
        <p>The United States is the largest user of Cospas-Sar-sat. Commander Steward said there were more than 300 false alarms daily because the 121.5-megahertz frequency could pick up emissions from things like garage door openers and pinball machines as distress signals.</p>
        <p>''It's a risk to personnel and a waste of taxpayersmoney to respond to these false alarms,'' he said.</p>
