        <p>Perhaps no proposal has raised more eyebrows and hackles this election year than the notion that America should invest part of Social Security proceeds in the financial markets. Yet there is ample precedent for this kind of investment: the Thrift Savings Plan, a government-run retirement income program for federal workers, including members of Congress and federal judges.</p>
        <p>Created by Congress in 1986, the plan had assets of $95 billion at the end of 1999. It offers a choice of stock or bond funds or Treasury securities to workers who contribute through payroll deductions. The stock fund's return of 13.19 percent for the year that ended Sept. 30 could make Uncle Sam blush over the 3 percent the Social Security trust fund earned in the same period.</p>

        <p>Perhaps no proposal has raised more eyebrows and hackles this election year than the notion that America should invest part of Social Security proceeds in the financial markets. Yet there is ample precedent for this kind of investment: the Thrift Savings Plan, a government-run retirement income program for federal workers, including members of Congress and federal judges.</p>
        <p>Created by Congress in 1986, the plan had assets of $95 billion at the end of 1999. It offers a choice of stock or bond funds or Treasury securities to workers who contribute through payroll deductions. The stock fund's return of 13.19 percent for the year that ended Sept. 30 could make Uncle Sam blush over the 3 percent the Social Security trust fund earned in the same period.</p>
        <p>The Thrift Savings Plan is not set up to cover all Americans. But it is a powerful example of the federal government's running a successful retirement plan that permits investment in stock and bond markets.</p>
        <p>Social Security will plunge into the red early in the century if something is not done to change it. And something must be done. Most Americans today rely on Social Security for the majority of their retirement income. And Americans show little appetite for saving on their own: in July the country reported a negative savings rate for the first time.</p>
        <p>In 1998 and 1999, I served with members of Congress and other appointees from the private sector on the bipartisan National Commission on Retirement Policy, a panel sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. We made several suggestions for improving America's present retirement system without changing its basic structure or raising taxes: setting a minimum guaranteed Social Security retirement payment; making it easier to carry private pension benefits from job to job; expanding individual retirement accounts; continuing to raise the age of eligibility for collecting full Social Security payments (now increasing on a fixed schedule for people who today are 62 and younger) until it reaches age 70 for those now 33 and younger; and giving economic incentives to workers who wish to stay in the work force beyond the retirement age. Our plan would not reduce the benefits already promised to those over 50 or the poor.</p>
        <p>But we also recommended something wholly new: returning two percentage points of the 12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax to Americans for individual investment. Workers could put those dollars into stock index funds, bond funds, Treasury securities or a mix of those, making individual investment choices as they would in 401(k) plans. The government's role would include reporting total dollars flowing to the private markets, monitoring fund performance and making sure fund operation is consistent with all laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>The risks of the kind of individual retirement savings accounts we propose are often overstated. Critics assume everyone would invest his or her newly liberated Social Security dollars in stocks, perhaps sinking the lot into the latest high-flier. That's wrong. Choosing a single stock is not an investment option for these dollars. Our plan called for a choice among stock index funds, lower-risk bond funds or Treasury securities. Even those who chose stock funds alone would not be taking an unacceptable risk over the long haul, if history is any guide. The American stock market has appreciated in every 20-year period in its history.</p>
        <p>Contrary to another common assumption, Wall Street would not be getting a windfall under a plan like ours. The new investments would be about $60 billion a year, a minute fraction of the $25 trillion now invested in financial markets.</p>
        <p>If Social Security as it is structured now is intended to be a savings plan, it is a bad one, for even savings accounts pay higher returns. If it is meant as a payment program funded by a tax, the tax we are using is regressive. The low-income earners hardest hit by this tax are especially in need of a chance to make some true headway into retirement security.</p>
