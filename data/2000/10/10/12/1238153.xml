        <p>General Electric Co says third-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, meeting analysts' expectations; for quarter ended Sept 30, net income rose to $3.18 billion compared with $2.65 billion in year-earlier quarter; revenue increased 18 percent, to $32 billion from $27.2 billion (M)</p>

        <p>The General Electric Company, apparently immune to the weak euro and the softening economy, said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, meeting analysts' estimates.</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended Sept. 30, net income rose to $3.18 billion, or 32 cents a share, compared with $2.65 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier when adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split. Revenue increased 18 percent, to $32 billion from $27.2 billion.</p>

        <p>The General Electric Company, apparently immune to the weak euro and the softening economy, said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, meeting analysts' estimates.</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended Sept. 30, net income rose to $3.18 billion, or 32 cents a share, compared with $2.65 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier when adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split. Revenue increased 18 percent, to $32 billion from $27.2 billion.</p>
        <p>''To the extent there were surprises, they were good ones,'' said Martin A. Sankey, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs who follows G.E.</p>
        <p>Investors, accustomed to G.E. meeting or beating expectations, reacted unenthusiastically. Shares of G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., slipped $1.63, to $56.63. But analysts reiterated their faith in the stock. ''It would be hard not to have a 'buy' on a company with numbers like this,'' said Jeffrey Sprague, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>The news was not all good: locomotive sales were down at GE Transportation; two small GE Capital businesses took a total of $240 million in charges for reorganization; NBCi, the interactive TV company in which NBC owns a 40 percent stake, is losing money; and growth was sluggish in service revenue for several sectors.</p>
        <p>Still, G.E. showed stellar results in industries that are riding a bumpy road. All chemical companies are suffering from price increases for petroleum products, but profits at GE Plastics rose 25 percent. Whirlpool and Maytag have issued earnings warnings, yet operating profits for GE Appliances rose 15 percent on a sales increase of 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Even the Olympics, which drew fewer viewers than expected, were a miniboon for NBC, the G.E. broadcasting arm. NBC gave advertisers extra air time to make up for the shortfall in viewers, but it did so by cutting promotional spots and squeezing more commercials into breaks. Thus, it did not need to repay money or offer free commercials in the future.</p>
        <p>''The Olympics may have been a ratings flop, but NBC probably performed better than it would have predicted,'' Mr. Sankey said.</p>
        <p>Also, more cable networks have agreed to carry MSNBC and CNBC, NBC's cable channels.</p>
        <p>Over all, G.E.'s success had several roots. Strong Japanese sales partly offset the euro's weakness. And sales of many of G.E.'s largest businesses, like Power Systems, are booked in dollars and are thus immune to currency fluctuations.</p>
        <p>G.E.'s continued emphasis on Six Sigma, a quality control program, and on pushing sales, purchasing and order processing onto the Internet, all helped productivity. Gary Sheffer, a G.E. spokesman, said savings from Six Sigma alone would hit $3 billion this year.</p>
        <p>G.E. has been helping its chief customers add Six Sigma and electronic-commerce programs. Analysts say that this cements customer loyalty and may soon be a service that G.E. will sell.</p>
        <p>''They are branding themselves as the best provider of information and productivity enhancement services,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>GE Appliances already has Web-based systems that let retailers ship items directly from G.E. factories to their customers. The setup has persuaded large retailers like Home Depot and, most recently, Wal-Mart Stores to offer G.E. refrigerators and the like.</p>
        <p>''All retailers want to run with minimal inventory, and G.E. is facilitating that,'' Mr. Sprague said.</p>
        <p>The quarter is unlikely to affect the race to succeed John F. Welch Jr., the G.E. chairman, who will retire next year. The contenders remain Robert L. Nardelli, head of GE Power Systems; Jeffrey R. Immelt, head of GE Medical Systems; and W. James McNerney Jr., head of GE Aircraft Engines.</p>
        <p>Power Systems and Medical Systems had robust sales and earnings. Aircraft Engines posted a 15 percent rise in operating profits despite a 3 percent decline in sales, and was named exclusive provider of engines for newer versions of the Boeing 777 and for several regional aircraft.</p>
        <p>Analysts have generally said that Mr. Immelt has the edge, and nothing about the quarter seems to have changed their minds. ''Jeff was the guy, and he's still the guy,'' one said.</p>
