        <p>Architectural institutions always compete for talks by leading talents. Here, a selective list of this fall's hottest tickets (unless noted, no reservations required): At Pratt Institute's School of Architecture, Robert Wilson, artist, theatrical provocateur and would-be architect, will speak tonight at 6 at Higgins Hall South, Room 115. On Nov. 9, Austria's master of chaotic design, Wolf Prix of Coop Himmelblau, will make a rare appearance. Pratt information, (718) 399-4304. The architecture school at City College of the City University of New York, under a new dean, George Ranalli, has invited some academically sprightly architects and thinkers. They include Thom Mayne (Nov. 30) of Morphosis in Santa Monica, Calif., whose Diamond Ranch is at left, and Steven Holl (Dec. 7) of New York; both at 6:30 p.m. in the Great Hall of Shepard Hall, Convent Avenue at 138th Street; information, (212) 650-7118. Tomorrow, Winy Maas of MVRDV, whose building designs look like core samples, comes from the Netherlands to speak at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, at Columbia University; 6:30 p.m. at Wood Auditorium, Avery Hall; (212) 854-3414. The Parsons School of Design will offer a musical performance after a talk by Gary Hilderbrand, a Harvard landscape designer, on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., Tishman Auditorium, 66 West 12th Street; (212) 229-8955. Crowds will probably mob the Architectural League on Nov. 2 for a lecture called ''Detonator Architecture'' with Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto of Reiser &amp; Umemoto, designers of bloblike urban developments, and Alexandros Washburn of Next/Move. Free to members; $7 to the public; 6:30 p.m., Ames Auditorium, Lighthouse International, 111 East 59th Street; (212) 753-1722.</p>
