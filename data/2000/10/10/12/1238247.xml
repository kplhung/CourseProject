        <p>With the scoreboard message urging it on, the Yankee Stadium throng chanted: ''We want a hit. We want a hit. We want a hit.'' Except it was not simply a chant. The fans were begging -- begging their heroes to get a hit. The players shared their feeling. The Yankees had not done much hitting against Seattle's sizzling pitching staff in the first two games of the American League Championship Series and were jeopardizing their extended presence in the postseason.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were coming to bat in the eighth inning of yesterday's Game 2. They had yet to score a run in the series against the wild-card Mariners and they had collected a total of 12 hits, 10 of them singles. Their hitters had batted a total of 13 times with runners in scoring position in the two games and had failed to get even one hit.</p>

        <p>With the scoreboard message urging it on, the Yankee Stadium throng chanted: ''We want a hit. We want a hit. We want a hit.'' Except it was not simply a chant. The fans were begging -- begging their heroes to get a hit. The players shared their feeling. The Yankees had not done much hitting against Seattle's sizzling pitching staff in the first two games of the American League Championship Series and were jeopardizing their extended presence in the postseason.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were coming to bat in the eighth inning of yesterday's Game 2. They had yet to score a run in the series against the wild-card Mariners and they had collected a total of 12 hits, 10 of them singles. Their hitters had batted a total of 13 times with runners in scoring position in the two games and had failed to get even one hit.</p>
        <p>''We want a hit,'' the fans implored. ''We want a hit. We want a hit.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had not scored in 21 innings, going back to their fifth and final game with the Oakland Athletics. The Athletics had kept them from scoring in the final five innings of that game, and the Mariners, primarily pitchers Freddy Garcia and John Halama, had shut them out in the league series.</p>
        <p>''We want a hit. We want a hit,'' the fans begged. ''We want a hit.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees heard them. They gave the fans a hit, David Justice's leadoff double, and they gave them a second hit, Bernie Williams' game-tying single. Then they gave them a bunch more, a total of eight in the inning, two more than they had had up to that inning and two more than they had had in the first game.</p>
        <p>The Yankees kept hitting in that inning until they had scored seven runs, as many runs as the Mariners had allowed to that point in five postseason games.</p>
        <p>All of the stunningly good work that Lou Piniella's pitchers had done for Seattle was obliterated. The relief corps' postseason string of 14 scoreless innings was shattered. Instead of going home with a commanding 2-0 series lead, the Mariners made the coast-to-coast trip with what turned out to be a disappointing split.</p>
        <p>''They hit some balls that found some holes,'' said Mark McLemore, the Mariners' second baseman, summing up the game. ''They hit those balls last night and didn't find holes. That's the beauty of this game -- or the ugliness, depending on where you're sitting.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners could have escaped the eighth inning with a 1-1 tie, the fans' verbal infusion notwithstanding, had their fielders made two plays they almost, but did not quite, make. The plays that left fielder Al Martin and McLemore didn't make came in succession and followed the single by Williams that sent Justice scooting home with the tying run.</p>
        <p>With Williams at first and the crowd's grateful cheers still echoing in the players' ears, Tino Martinez hit a sinking line drive to left field. At first it appeared the ball might fall in for a hit, but Martin charged in and dived headfirst with glove facing out.</p>
        <p>The ball hit the glove, but immediately caromed off the glove. It fell to the ground, and Williams, who had held up in case Martin caught the ball, scampered to second, arriving there in time to beat a force play.</p>
        <p>''I saw it off the bat, broke in and right into the lights,'' Martin said. ''I hesitated. When a line drive is hit to you, you don't have time to hesitate. You're there or you're not. Once it got in the lights, that one second, it threw everything off. I lost it, didn't see it, then saw it again late.''</p>
        <p>An inning later, Piniella said after the game, and he would have replaced Martin defensively. He didn't want to make the change in the eighth, he said, because ''it was a 1-0 ballgame and he was coming up second in the next inning; we would have made the change in the eighth if he had batted in the eighth.''</p>
        <p>Asked where the ball hit in his glove, Martin said, ''It didn't go into the glove.'' What, then, did the ball do? ''It dropped,'' Martin said.</p>
        <p>Martin, however, might have been the only person in the park who did not think the ball hit his glove. Many pairs of eyes believed that it did and television replays revealed that it did. Even his manager thought it did. The outcome, however, was the same. The Yankees had runners at first and second with no one out, and Jorge Posada was at bat.</p>
        <p>Posada rapped a hard grounder between first and second. McLemore darted toward the ball. He dived for it. He got his glove on it. But just as that evasive baseball did with Martin, it didn't stick. It dribbled out of McLemore's glove and rolled into short right field.</p>
        <p>''I thought I had it, but obviously I didn't,'' McLemore said. ''I don't know how that happened because I really thought I had it.''</p>
        <p>Willie Randolph, the third-base coach, waved Williams home, and the Yankees led for the first time.</p>
        <p>Had the balls stuck in Martin's and McLemore's gloves, the Mariners would have been two-thirds out of the inning with a runner at first.</p>
        <p>Instead the Yankees were ahead, 2-1, and when Paul O'Neill hit a fly ball to left field, Martinez, who had reached third on Posada's hit, scored. Had O'Neill hit that same fly with two outs, the Mariners would have gone to the ninth inning tied, 1-1. Instead they went home tied, 1-1.</p>
