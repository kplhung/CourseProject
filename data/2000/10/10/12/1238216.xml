        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am an educator at P.S. 171 and would like to respond to ''A Day in the Life of the Wired School'' (Oct. 5), about the use of computer technology in the classroom. The article described how children were finding information online, then cutting and pasting it into reports. My classroom isn't wired, and many of my students do not have computers at home. However, they are learning to take notes and to paraphrase their information, not to plagiarize.</p>

        <p>I agree that learning how to use the Internet wisely and being able to cut and paste data is important to learn, but the basics (and ethics) of report writing must be taught as well.</p>
