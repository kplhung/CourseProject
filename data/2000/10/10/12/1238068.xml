        <p>ANY adult who has ever been transfixed by the comic whirl of Sesame Street knows that some of the world's best entertainment is made for children. In the world of games, you can find that same sort of bright, cynicism-free joy in Humongous Entertainment's Pajama Sam 3: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet, an adventure game aimed at children ages 3 to 8 that can entertain just about anybody.</p>
        <p>The star of this game is a child who has sensibly decided to name himself after his favorite comic book superhero, Pajama Man. With his pajamas and his cape, the boy pretends he is the fabulous superhero and fights mischief wherever it appears. In this case, he must track down some marauding cookies, following them into what appears to be his own body. He never does find those cookies, but he is soon overtaken by a more serious threat -- a possible war between the food groups.</p>

        <p>ANY adult who has ever been transfixed by the comic whirl of Sesame Street knows that some of the world's best entertainment is made for children. In the world of games, you can find that same sort of bright, cynicism-free joy in Humongous Entertainment's Pajama Sam 3: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet, an adventure game aimed at children ages 3 to 8 that can entertain just about anybody.</p>
        <p>The star of this game is a child who has sensibly decided to name himself after his favorite comic book superhero, Pajama Man. With his pajamas and his cape, the boy pretends he is the fabulous superhero and fights mischief wherever it appears. In this case, he must track down some marauding cookies, following them into what appears to be his own body. He never does find those cookies, but he is soon overtaken by a more serious threat -- a possible war between the food groups.</p>
        <p>It's a fact that cookies and carrots do not get along. Cheese thinks it's far superior to bread. None of the six food groups are in harmony. This is where I discovered that Pajama Sam is an educational game, because I didn't know there were six groups.  The last time I read a cereal box on the subject there were only four. (It turns out that the United States Agriculture Department now has five recommended food groups -- grains, vegetables, fruits, diary products and meats -- and a miscellaneous group for whatever is left.)</p>
        <p>None of this is explained in Pajama Sam, perhaps on the assumption that 8-year-olds aren't interested in the U.S.D.A. or perhaps because the game's makers were afraid that children would be puzzled by why beans are part of the meat group. But the agency's food pyramid is represented in Pajama Sam by a pyramid with bas-reliefs of each food group.</p>
        <p>Pajama Sam is not so much educational as informative. Like the previous Pajama Sam games, Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening and No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside, the purpose is to help youngsters make sense of the mysteries of the universe.</p>
        <p>The food groups have decided to send delegates to a peace conference to work out their differences. Unfortunately most of the delegates have gotten lost on the way to the conference. They are all foods that don't travel well. Pajama Sam, who ''always helps those in need,'' sets out to find these delegates and bring peace to his stomach.</p>
        <p>The delegates aren't difficult to locate -- they wear rakishly tilted straw hats. They are all stuck somewhere -- Chuck Cheddar is stranded in a hot air balloon, Granny Smythe is trapped in a pit of caramel -- and Pajama Sam must use his wits to free them from their predicaments.</p>
        <p>The puzzles are simple but intelligent. Sam is presented with a variety of challenges -- matching jokes to punch lines, determining what kind of cheese the moon is made of, mediating a legume strike. Along the way he meets a variety of colorful characters: bikinied cupcakes with Valley Girl inflections, lying on the beach ''baking''; a balloon-selling string bean who, when Sam asks him if he sells balloons, replies, ''Give the boy a college scholarship, he's a genius''; a cabbage librarian reading a book about three young women who fall in love with steelworkers during the disco era.</p>
        <p>As all of Humongous Entertainment's adventure games do, Pajama Sam supplies comic vignettes behind every leaf and under every rock. Click on items around Sam with your mouse and they will spring to life: a globe lamp fills itself with goldfish, a cloud turns into a bunny slipper. Adventure games usually involve investigating everything in your environment, and Humongous has found a way to make this more of a pleasure than a chore.</p>
        <p>The game doesn't end even after you've played Pajama Sam through to the end. One of its ingenious features is that the delegates may be trapped in a different location the next time you play, and you will need a different solution to free them. There are also smaller random elements, like the location of Sam's cape (he can't very well begin his superhero duties without it) or which condiment needs to be spread on a dam of giant French fries. This is a clever touch, allowing children to play the game more than once without its being exactly the same each time, fulfilling children's need for something new and fondness for doing the same thing over and over.</p>
        <p>What is most likely to drive you crazy is puzzling out where you've heard Pajama Sam's voice before.  The voice is that of Pamela Segall Adlon, who is also the voice of Bobby Hill on the television cartoon ''King of the Hill,'' although Sam sounds much more cheerful than Bobby ever did.</p>
        <p>Pajama Sam is a very happy game. Sam doesn't walk from place to place -- he leaps, each leap accompanied by matching sound effects. With a perpetual smile on his face, Sam befriends tire-size talking doughnuts and eats refrigerator-size cakes. And yet, Pajama Sam never descends into that sugary sweetness that makes a lot of children's entertainment agonizing for adults. Like Sesame Street, Pajama Sam respects the intelligence of its audience, even when that audience is a little bit older than intended.</p>
        <p>Pajama Sam 3: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet; from Humongous Entertainment; $24.99, for Windows and Macintosh; for all ages.</p>
