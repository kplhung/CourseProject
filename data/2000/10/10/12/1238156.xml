        <p>He is in the beat-up county car again, this time driving to dinner. The Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, steers to Bryant &amp; Cooper Steakhouse in Roslyn on a recent night. He does not exactly know the way, and some at the restaurant do not exactly seem to know who he is, though he has been county executive for almost 14 years.</p>
        <p>He says the car, a black four-door Ford Crown Victoria with 176,733 miles on it, has been with him since ''Day 1,'' which would have been when he took office in 1987. Not exactly. The blue registration sticker says it is a 1989 vehicle. At dinner, he cannot recall his grandfather's name.</p>

        <p>He is in the beat-up county car again, this time driving to dinner. The Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, steers to Bryant &amp; Cooper Steakhouse in Roslyn on a recent night. He does not exactly know the way, and some at the restaurant do not exactly seem to know who he is, though he has been county executive for almost 14 years.</p>
        <p>He says the car, a black four-door Ford Crown Victoria with 176,733 miles on it, has been with him since ''Day 1,'' which would have been when he took office in 1987. Not exactly. The blue registration sticker says it is a 1989 vehicle. At dinner, he cannot recall his grandfather's name.</p>
        <p>After dinner, as rain threatens the October night, Mr. Gulotta brings up Sebastian Junger's 1997 book about a doomed commercial fishing trip to the Grand Banks. It is called ''The Perfect Storm,'' but he cannot remember the exact title.</p>
        <p>''The storm,'' he says, fumbling for the full name.</p>
        <p>He steers the Crown Victoria through Mineola as if he is the skipper of the Andrea Gail, pulling it to the curb outside 1 West Street, the scene of his own administration's raging storm. He speaks of the book, of its details on navigating a squall, of trying to ''roll with the waves'' instead of capsizing.</p>
        <p>The analogy is nearly perfect. Mr. Gulotta is facing a financial tsunami: a multimillion-dollar budget deficit that is far from a freak of nature. And after years of risky fiscal schemes and a reluctance by Mr. Gulotta to raise property taxes, many inside and outside the county government say its longtime leader is going down with the ship.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gulotta, who has spent decades moving through Nassau's electorate -- shaking hands and snapping photos all the way -- this moment is the culmination of a career that has been both anointed and ridiculed. He is a man who has willingly lived in the shadow of his politician father and who most acknowledge was propped up by a Republican powerhouse. Yet those who know him also talk of his complicated nature, his acute dedication to his constituency and party ideals.</p>
        <p>However Mr. Gulotta arrived at this point, both his supporters and critics agree that the county executive is now akin to a mutinied captain riding out a gale.</p>
        <p>A state panel, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, is monitoring his administration's troubled finances. It has rejected his budget plans and threatens to seize the county's fiscal operations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta insists his budget numbers add up. The state authority has one stern response: not exactly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta insists that working together, he and the County Legislature's leaders -- Presiding Officer Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat, and Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader -- can stave off a takeover. Yet he faces some of his most  searing attacks from within his own party, which had held him up as its defender of low taxes.</p>
        <p>''I do hold him directly responsible for the demise of Nassau County's fiscal condition and the taint that has applied itself unjustifiably to other good public officials in the Republican Party,'' says Bruce A. Blakeman, a Republican and former legislative presiding officer who was swept from office last fall. ''I felt that there was nobody at the wheel of the ship.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta deflects such criticism. ''We were a team protecting the taxpayers,'' he says. ''But now that a problem has developed, the quarterback is being accused of dropping the ball and the team is scrambling when we should be pulling together to reach the goal.''</p>
        <p>He says the party's strategy last year, laying the problems at his feet, backfired. Angry voters gave Democrats control of the County Legislature for the first time since 1917. But he refuses to point fingers, instead saying that his party needs to work together to make things right.</p>
        <p>Driving in that car to the restaurant in Roslyn, when asked if he still likes his job, he answers: ''Love it. I wouldn't do it if I didn't.''</p>
        <p>It is a job many say Thomas Stephen Gulotta was born for, on April 27, 1944. With the backing of Joseph M. Margiotta -- then the powerful county Republican chairman -- he won a seat in the State Assembly in 1976 and never stopped winning.</p>
        <p>But politics was always the predictable route. His father, Frank A. Gulotta Sr., became a suburban legend, the first Italian-American elected to a countywide office in Nassau when he won a seat as district attorney in 1949.</p>
        <p>''His father was a towering human being,'' Anthony J. Panzarella, a Republican and the mayor of Malverne who was Mr. Gulotta's parks commissioner from 1987 to 1995. He says Mr. Gulotta relied on his father for advice and was crushed by his death.</p>
        <p>Back at Bryant &amp; Cooper, at 8 p.m., Mr. Gulotta says as much. His dad died in December 1989, and his mother, Josephine, 13 months later.</p>
        <p>He sits in the middle of the restaurant's dining room, forearms on a square tabletop. He is built like a  middleweight boxer and wears well-tailored suits and a gold ring on his left pinky.</p>
        <p>After the waiter comes to take his order, a woman approaches, full of praise. ''You're doing a great job,'' Jeanne Wilde, a registered independent, says. Mr. Gulotta grins, his brown eyes focused on her. They are touching now and he is clearly in his element: among the people.</p>
        <p>This is how he has spent his political career. And an adoring electorate rewarded him well, providing him big victories and a deep reservoir of Teflon-like righteousness.</p>
        <p>''He would be perfect doing what Queen Elizabeth does in England,'' Lisanne G. Altmann, a Democratic county legislator, says. ''He should be the figurehead. He should be the ambassador. He is like the royalty. He should be out there waving and talking and shaking hands. And you know, she doesn't do government and neither does he.''</p>
        <p>It was the same criticism he got on Sept. 15, the day his budget was due. Mr. Gulotta, or a representative, was scheduled to appear at a handful of civic events: an honor ceremony for a 50-year fireman, an Eagle Scout presentation and a youth council dinner. He sent aides to each event and still nearly blew a midnight deadline to deliver the budget. It came in at 11:58 p.m.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta was heavily criticized, but he says he ''wanted to make certain that we utilized all the time available to us to make certain this budget document was the most credible fiscal plan that this county has ever submitted.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks later, after the state authority warned him to work with the other leaders in county government, Mr. Gulotta began mass-producing a letter to residents lauding his efforts in balancing the budget.  The missive cost $50,000 for postage alone, said Darren Bloch, chief of staff to the legislative majority.</p>
        <p>''It is sad,'' Mr. Schmitt says of the move. ''It is the same playbook. It has got to be worn. He has been doing it for 13 years. It did work once, sure. The handshakes, the last election, the new Nassau. But who ever knew it was going to get so tattered?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta and those who know him say he spends so much time with people because his prime vision is to personalize government. He says he finds that residents open up more easily outside the stiff county offices. The schedule is withering, but it helps him better understand their needs.</p>
        <p>To relax -- his biggest weakness, his wife, Elizabeth, says, is that he does not know how -- Mr. Gulotta likes to spend time with their three children, T. J., 25, Christopher, 23, and Elizabeth, who turned 21 on Sunday. He also likes to go to church, tend to his flower garden or romp with the family golden retriever, Lexi.</p>
        <p>But since his election to the Assembly in 1976, there hasn't been much quiet time, especially since the late 1980's, when the economy soured. Mr. Gulotta set off widespread criticism when he proposed a 25 percent property tax increase to close a deficit in 1992, when the recession was in full bore. But the tax increase was cut by more than half by the county supervisors and Mr. Gulotta was forced to lay off many county employees.</p>
        <p>He was left reeling, feeling lower than he ever had before, he says. Scalded by a close re-election fight the next year, Mr. Gulotta seemed to experience a conversion. His budgets from then on avoided the slightest increase in the general tax rate.</p>
        <p>Despite his controversial past, Mr. Gulotta has not ruled out a run for a fourth full term and has a $2.5 million war chest.</p>
        <p>After dinner at the Roslyn steakhouse, the New York Yankees are playing the Oakland A's on a television screen above the restaurant bar. Mr. Gulotta, a Mets fan who played sandlot ball in Lynbrook as a boy, says he used to like the Yankees ''until they moved away.'' He meant to say the Dodgers, formerly of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>An innocent mistake, sure. These days, his critics, his family and Mr. Gulotta himself say he has much on his mind. And he increasingly finds himself a man alone.</p>
        <p>''They used to fall over themselves to pose in pictures with him,'' State Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, the Nassau Democratic Party chairman, said of Mr. Gulotta's fellow Republicans. But Mr. DiNapoli said he wouldn't count Mr. Gulotta out just yet.</p>
        <p>''I think the final chapter in terms of what his service will mean and how long it will be for has yet to be written,'' he said.</p>
