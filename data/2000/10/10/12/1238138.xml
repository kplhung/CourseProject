        <p>Kenneth Noe stepped down yesterday as the chief executive officer of the New York Racing Association after a tumultuous six years, during which he made the state's premier tracks profitable once again but failed to halt a steady slide in attendance.</p>
        <p>Noe, 72, told the racing association's board of trustees at a meeting in Manhattan that he was in poor health and wanted to spend more time with his family in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
        <p>''I have always felt that an individual should know when to stop aside,'' he said in a statement. ''That time has come for me. I have some health problems which I hope are only minor and I do not feel that I can give the number of hours that need to be given to the job.''</p>
        <p>The 28 trustees immediately elected Barry K. Schwartz, the chairman and chief executive officer of Calvin Klein Inc., to succeed Noe. Schwartz owns a major racing stable in New York and in recent years has become a powerful figure in horse racing circles.</p>
        <p>Noe's resignation comes at a time when the New York State attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, has launched an investigation into an alleged money laundering scheme involving parimutuel clerks at New York tracks and organized crime. Federal prosecutors have also subpoenaed documents from racing association officials as part of an income tax investigation.</p>
        <p>But state investigators said Noe himself was not under scrutiny. ''The headache of the ongoing investigation may have loomed as an annoyance to him,'' a law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said yesterday. ''But there is no expectation that he is implicated.''</p>
        <p>Schwartz and other trustees said Noe had been talking about retiring long before the state investigation came to light two weeks ago. ''There is no hidden agenda here,'' Schwartz said. ''Kenny's been wanting to retire for some time.''</p>
        <p>The first big challenge facing Schwartz was one of Noe's biggest frustrations: the struggle to buy the Off Track Betting Corporation from New York City. With attendance at New York tracks in a slow slide, acquiring the city's betting parlors, which bring in about $1 billion in bets a year, is seen by many as the key to the racing association's long-term survival.</p>
        <p>''It makes absolutely no sense to have two different organizations,'' Schwartz said.</p>
        <p>Last year, trustees of N.Y.R.A. believed they had reached an understanding with the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on a $240 million offer to buy O.T.B. But the deal fell apart for undisclosed reasons and city officials indicated last week that they would seek bids from private companies to compete with N.Y.R.A. for O.T.B.</p>
        <p>Noe, the son of a trainer who rose to become a successful racetrack manager in Florida, took over as N.Y.R.A.'s president in 1994. At the time, the agency was losing $10 million a year and had come under fire for its bloated payroll and lavish perquisites for top officials.</p>
        <p>Noe cut costs through 200 layoffs and persuaded the state government to reduce parimutuel taxes. By 1996, the corporation was showing a modest profit and has remained in the black since. During his tenure, Noe also pumped more than $40 million into improvements at the organization's three tracks: Saratoga, Aqueduct and Belmont Park. He raised purses, attracting better horses. In the state legislature, he managed to fight off proposals in 1997 to privatize the tracks.</p>
        <p>Along the way, however, Noe alienated some trainers and employees with his brusque management style. A state investigation in 1996 found, among other things, that N.Y.R.A. officials had given a $1 million contract to a company with links to organized crime.</p>
        <p>In late 1996, Noe was elevated to chairman of the board of trustees and chief executive officer. His longtime protege, Terry Meyocks, became president. Noe began spending more time at his home in Florida, but he kept a hand in the day-to-day operation at the tracks.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, Noe had begun to complain about the workload, trustees and friends said. He recently underwent surgery to repair circulatory problems in his legs.</p>
        <p>''He's been talking about stepping down,'' Lewis Rudin, a trustee, said.</p>
        <p>Schwartz said yesterday that he would leave the daily operation of the tracks to Meyocks and other senior N.Y.R.A. officials, while concentrating on marketing, strategic planning and large projects, like the acquisition of O.T.B.</p>
        <p>Schwartz declined to say whether he would make changes in senior management.</p>
        <p>''They have some outstanding people, but until you get into a company and work with people on a day-to-day basis, you don't know,'' he said.</p>
