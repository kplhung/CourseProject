        <p>Dayton Contemporary Dance Company from Ohio has returned to the Joyce Theater, its first season here since Jeraldyne Blunden, the troupe's founder and artistic director, died nearly a year ago.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. Blunden, a woman of great warmth and principle, obviously remains a guiding inspiration. Kevin Ward has succeeded her as artistic director, and Debbie Blunden-Diggs, her daughter, is associate artistic director.</p>
        <p>Highlighted by ''Children of the Passage,'' a rousing New York premiere choreographed by Donald McKayle and Ronald K. Brown to live music by the terrific Dirty Dozen Brass Band, the opening of the troupe's weeklong season on Tuesday was a showcase for creativity and virtuoso dancing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blunden had gone out of her way to make the company a repository of modern-dance classics derived from the black heritage.</p>
        <p>These revivals, sponsored by the American Dance Festival's ''Black Tradition in American Dance'' project, have helped give the troupe its international cachet since 1994.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Ms. Blunden encouraged new talent. Dwight Rhoden and Mr. Ward, both represented on the program, choreographed early in their careers for the Dayton company.</p>
        <p>This time, the two programs in the run focus on contemporary works.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ward led off with the New York premiere of ''Sets and Chasers,'' a polished gloss on jazz dancing, inspired by Duke Ellington's music. At their most brilliant, the images look like good Cubist stuff. Vernacular movement is refracted into angular forms, revealing an inner reality. This is not literal jazz dancing in any style but a stylized form that takes an attitude toward its source.</p>
        <p>Above all, the piece is a trampoline for some fantastic dancers, including the young Daniel Marshall, whose high leg extensions and rubber-legged resilience only hint at his genius.</p>
        <p>The chasers in Mr. Ward's title refer to the fanfares Ellington's band used at the end of a set, as heard here in a radio recording made in a ballroom on Nov. 7, 1940, in Fargo, N.D.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ward's program note refers to his view of jazz in the context of a social occasion, and although there are allusions to the Lindy and other dances of the 1940's, he evokes a social gathering for our time through an eclectic idiom that includes ballet bravura.</p>
        <p>He also choreographs to the strength of a multicultural troupe that has a signature style rooted not so much in power as in speed, suppleness and intricacy.</p>
        <p>Snake hips vie with sharp swoons; the women in short skirts often squat as they swing a leg around. Sheri (Sparkle) Williams, the company's star, splices a leg beat known as brise within the fast footwork; G. D. Harris, with his grand style and expansive jumps, and Mr. Marshall, scampering or double-jointed, have a challenge duet, and their female counterparts, DeShona Pepper and Greer A. Reed, swivel, slink and strut.</p>
        <p>Monnette Michiyo Bariel, Julius Brewster, Aoi Funakoshi, Ricardo J. Garcia Cruz and David Reuille completed the vibrant cast.</p>
        <p>''Children of the Passage'' has some similarities with ''Grace,'' Mr. Brown's hit for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater last year. Again, dancers (this time in fanciful 19th-century dress by Omotayo W. Olanja) throw off their mortal coil and end up purified in white.</p>
        <p>If the choreography often has the same contrast of energetic eruptions and sinuous flow that are now Mr. Brown's signature, the imagery recalls the evocative pictures Mr. McKayle, the senior choreographer in this joint venture, has provided in his pieces, especially others also inspired by New Orleans.</p>
        <p>The piece has its mysteries. Mr. Marshall, in a brocade robe, is host to a ball in the first section, ''Dark Mansion,'' interrupted by Mr. Harris, who delivers a thigh-slapping virtuoso solo as a voodoo priest in a derby. Under their haughty facade, the assembled guests degenerate into a group of grotesques. Ms. Williams expires and gets some New Orleans funeral music from the band (Frederick Sanders, Roger Lewis, Kevin Harris, Efrem Towns, Julius McKee, Terence Higgins and Sammie Williams).</p>
        <p>''Shout,'' the final ensemble, speaks of deliverance. The dancers included Maria Berman Glimcher and Alvin J. Rangel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhoden, whose recent work for ballet companies has been superb, misfired with ''Sky Garden,'' a continuum of fast and furious movement that unfortunately signified nothing. Overlong, it was set to an electronic score by Antonio Carlos Scott. By contrast, Ms. Williams was her dynamo self, full of tension and release in Mr. Rhoden's solo, ''Growth.''</p>
