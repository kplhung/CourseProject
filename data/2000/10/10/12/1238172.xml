        <p>When I.B.M. announced on Tuesday that it would spend $2.5 billion and hire 1,000 new employees to create ''the world's most technologically advanced'' chip factory here, the conventional wisdom, perhaps, was that the news would elate the residents of this Hudson Valley town.</p>

        <p>When I.B.M. announced on Tuesday that it would spend $2.5 billion and hire 1,000 new employees to create ''the world's most technologically advanced'' chip factory here, the conventional wisdom, perhaps, was that the news would elate the residents of this Hudson Valley town.</p>
        <p>After all, the announcement came seven years after the company had stunned and demoralized the community with a severe downsizing that disproved the assumption that a job at Big Blue was a job forever.</p>
        <p>But instead, as news of the expansion settled today, people here said that they were pleased, but added some asterisks. Sure, the 1,000 jobs would be nice and would complement the bevy of large and small businesses that have opened here in recent years. But would this mean more overcrowding in the local schools? Would it mean even more new housing developments in a booming real estate market?</p>
        <p>''I can see where people are very tentative,'' said Marlene Stager, a substance-abuse counselor, who was taking two of her sons to the local library, which is in the midst of an expansion project. ''I.B.M. is just not the same anymore, because people know that maybe they'll cut people loose in another 5 or 10 years.''</p>
        <p>If East Fishkill, which is 67 miles from Manhattan, was once the epitome of a one-company town, it is now the epitome of how the good times and astounding growth associated with the new economy can make the most painful of memories recede a little more easily, even after what was supposed to be the most crippling of events.</p>
        <p>It is hard to overstate how devastating people thought I.B.M.'s downsizing was back in 1993. Everyone here, it seemed, either worked for the company or had a relative or neighbor who did. So when the company announced the cutbacks, people could hardly believe the news, and resented the company bitterly for destroying the area's equivalent of a tenured job, a resentment that still lingers in some quarters.</p>
        <p>But the Hudson Valley of 2000 is much different from the Hudson Valley of 1993. Now, new developments with half-million dollar homes are sprouting everywhere. Home-based businesses run by former I.B.M. employees abound. Rentals are snapped up in hours. The unemployment rate is among the lowest in the region.</p>
        <p>So while I.B.M. is still a major force in the area, people now regard the company as just one of many businesses, and not the only game in town.</p>
        <p>''It's not the real bread and butter in the community,'' said Rich Robbins, the senior public health sanitarian for the Dutchess County Department of Health, who was inspecting wells at a new housing development not far the I.B.M. site.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. plans to build its new factory, which will produce some of the thinnest computer chips in the world, within a building where it had closed a major chip-production operation in 1993, at the coda of a series of moves paring its work force in the region to 14,000 from 30,700 in 1985.</p>
        <p>So naturally, the people most excited by the news, other than the local and state officials who had avidly courted the company and granted it a generous package of tax breaks and incentives, were businesses located near the site. Across the street from the old factory, Rania Nsheiwat, whose brother, Omar, owns Robbie's Y2K Deli, said that her family's business would probably extend its hours to cater to the new I.B.M. employees.</p>
        <p>But in areas beyond the immediate vicinity of the plant, the reaction, while supportive, was also much more guarded and muted.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the town has attracted a wave of people from Westchester, Putnam and the Bronx. These new residents -- sometimes called the ''city folk'' by longtime residents -- typically work either in Manhattan or in Westchester, but have decided that the long time spent commuting is a fair price to pay for bigger and cheaper houses than they could find in their former communities.</p>
        <p>Theresa Belluzzi is typical of the new crowd. She and her family moved from Yonkers eight years ago, buying a house from a family that had been downsized by I.B.M. Her husband is a union representative in Manhattan, and she runs a business out of her home teaching people how to organize and preserve their family photos.</p>
        <p>The I.B.M.-ers, she said, were bitter then, making snide remarks about the company. But these days, hardly anyone talks about the company's fortunes or misfortunes. In fact, the job market is so tight these days, service at low-wage employers like Wal-Mart is paltry. So the addition of 1,000 jobs will most likely  make the job market even tighter.</p>
        <p>''I really think they're going to overcrowd the area,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for the former I.B.M.-ers, some said that they thought the new factory was great news, particularly as a psychological boost. But some said that the original layoffs from the mid-1990's, while devastating at first, had not been a permanent blow because many employees had started their own businesses or returned to do some consulting work, albeit at lower salaries, for I.B.M.</p>
        <p>''Actually, with I.B.M. downsizing, in retrospect, it was a big nothing,'' said Chris McClernon, a senior loan officer at Warwick Savings Bank, whose husband received a severance package from I.B .M. in 1993. ''It's always nice to have people come in, but it's like 'where are we going to put them?' ''</p>
