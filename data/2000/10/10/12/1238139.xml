        <p>An agreement by the Agriculture Department to bring mice, rats and birds under federal rules for animal care in research would be delayed for at least a year under a bill approved yesterday by the House.</p>
        <p>The Senate was expected to approve the bill on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The agreement, made under pressure by animal rights advocates, appeared to be moving forward last Friday when Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of the Federal District Court for the  District of Columbia ruled that Johns Hopkins University could not block the settlement between the Agriculture Department and animal rights advocates. The New York Times reported erroneously on Saturday that the judge said the smaller animals must be given care under the Federal Animal Welfare Act, but in fact, she did not rule on the substance of the agreement.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, which is voluntary and does not require court approval, the department would draft regulations that would include the smaller animals under the welfare act, which now applies mainly to larger animals like dogs, cats and  monkeys.</p>
        <p>But over the weekend, during a House-Senate conference on the Agriculture Appropriations bill, a sentence was added that prevented the Agriculture Department from using money in this fiscal year to prepare or write such a regulation.</p>
        <p>The sentence was inserted by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of  Mississippi, at the request of research universities, a member of his staff said.</p>
        <p>The bill does not invalidate the agreement, merely postpones it.</p>
        <p>Rats and mice are the most common research subjects. Including them in the act would require laboratories using them to register with the government, to submit to annual inspections and to meet minimum standards for their care, feeding and pain relief.</p>
        <p>The act would also require scientists to consider alternatives to using animals in research.</p>
        <p>Research groups have said that including small animals would take money from research budgets and increase the paperwork for scientists.</p>
