        <p>The Republican National Committee released two new commercials this week attacking Vice President Al Gore for proposing a budget that it asserted would turn projected surpluses into deficits and endanger the nation's prosperity.</p>
        <p>The advertising is part of an effort by the Republicans to put Mr. Gore on the defensive over his proposals for new spending and to neutralize any advantage that the strong economy might give Mr. Gore.

        <p>The Republican National Committee released two new commercials this week attacking Vice President Al Gore for proposing a budget that it asserted would turn projected surpluses into deficits and endanger the nation's prosperity.</p>
        <p>The advertising is part of an effort by the Republicans to put Mr. Gore on the defensive over his proposals for new spending and to neutralize any advantage that the strong economy might give Mr. Gore. It also tries to blunt Mr. Gore's attacks on Mr. Bush's tax plan, which Democrats say disproportionately favors the wealthy.</p>
        <p>One of the commercials focuses exclusively on the scale of Mr. Gore's spending plans. The other contrasts Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan with Mr. Gore's spending proposals.</p>
        <p>The commercials are scheduled to run in 17 states, including Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Cold Harbor Films</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Opens with a white screen and the words ''Whose economic plan is best for you?'' Then flashes to a screen with a chart labeled ''Bush: Tax Cut Plan,'' showing how people at various income levels would do under Mr. Bush's proposal. Next comes a chart comparing the spending proposals made by President Clinton with those made by Mr. Gore. Concludes with text on a white screen saying that Mr. Gore's plan would undermine the economy.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: ''Whose economic plan is best for you? Under George Bush's plan, a family earning under $35,000 a year pays no federal income taxes, a 100 percent tax cut. Earn $35-50,000? A 55 percent tax cut. And Al Gore's plan? Three times the new spending President Clinton proposed, so much it wipes out the entire surplus and creates a deficit again. Al Gore's deficit spending plan threatens America's prosperity.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The chart describing the effects of the Bush tax plan is somewhat misleading. Many families making less than $35,000 a year already pay no federal income taxes. Mr. Bush's plan would remove more of them from the income tax rolls, mainly by doubling the child credit. But the claims in the commercial are based on a family with two children; single people and families with fewer than two children would not fare as well.</p>
        <p>The assertion that Mr. Gore is proposing three times the spending sought by Mr. Clinton is based on a comparison of the 1992 Clinton campaign's agenda with Mr. Gore's proposals this year. Mr. Clinton made his proposals at a time when the government was running a record budget deficit and was constrained from expanding or adding programs. Mr. Gore is proposing ways to allocate a large and growing surplus. The comparison is based on a study by the National Taxpayer's Union, a conservative research group, which says Mr. Gore's spending plans total $2.9 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gore puts the number at between $870 billion and $1 trillion.</p>
        <p>SCORE CARD -- Mr. Bush has sought to frame the debate as one about who would best take advantage of the nation's prosperity, rather than about who gets the credit for it. The new advertising is intended to suggest that Mr. Gore is an old-style tax-and-spend liberal who will squander the surplus, while emphasizing that Mr. Bush is giving a tax break to lower and middle income families. But the more that Mr. Bush pushes economic issues, the more he risks reminding voters that the country has rarely, if ever, had it this good.</p>
