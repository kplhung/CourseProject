        <p>After several weeks of indecision, the Giuliani administration offered a tepid endorsement yesterday of an Election Day ballot item that would authorize $3.8 billion in new borrowing to finance state highway, rail and other transportation projects.</p>
        <p>The administration, while urging city voters to support the measure, echoed skepticism already expressed by several local officials who have questioned how much of what would be the largest bond act in state history would actually end up being spent in New York City.</p>
        <p>''As the city's strong economy continues to attract new businesses, residents and visitors, our existing transportation infrastructure must be expanded to keep pace,'' said Robert Grotell, director of the mayor's Office of Transportation, during testimony before the City Council Transportation Committee yesterday. ''Yet we are all too familiar with the difficulties of allocating a finite amount of funding across seemingly infinite project opportunities.''</p>
        <p>As planned, $1.8 billion of the total would be invested in highways and bridge projects statewide, while an additional $1.6 billion would go to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for upgrading the region's subway, rail and bus system. The remaining $400 million would be split among other state public transit systems, ports, airports and canals.</p>
        <p>State officials say that over the next five years, the money would help buy 1,100 new subway cars, 1,200 new buses and renovate 64 subway stations and complete the design work for a Second Avenue subway line. The money would also pay for dozens of local highway projects, including the reconstruction of parts of the Grand Central Parkway and Henry Hudson Parkway.</p>
        <p>But Giuliani administration officials said yesterday that they were concerned that the new bonds might just replace other sources of state financing already committed for city transportation projects. The skepticism, they noted, is justified given the state's failure to deliver the city money that was promised from previous bond acts, such as 1972 and 1996 measures supporting recycling and other environmental projects.</p>
        <p>New York City's support for the measure is considered critical, not only because of its obviously large voting block, but the tendency, in some recent bond acts, for voters elsewhere in the state to oppose new debt spending. The most recent bond measure put before state voters -- a $2.4 billion school construction act in 1997 -- failed, as did two of the six bond acts related to transportation voted on since 1971.</p>
        <p>As recently as yesterday morning, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was the target of criticism by some of the many local elected officials, business and labor leaders who had lined up to endorse the $3.8 billion transportation bond act.</p>
        <p>''His voice is an important one to be heard,'' said C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, minutes before Mr. Grotell testified to put the administration on record in favor of the measure.</p>
        <p>But even some of the City Council members who support the measure said yesterday that they remained uncertain whether it would pass. There has been no organized statewide campaign to urge voter support, something considered critical in past successful bond act efforts.</p>
        <p>''This helps a little bit, but not greatly,'' said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Democrat from Queens who is a member of the Transportation Committee. ''They should have defined better for voters what this means. That is the fault of Albany.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said yesterday that the governor welcomed the mayor's support. ''We are confident the bond act will deliver substantial benefits for all regions of the state including New York City,'' Mr. Conway said.</p>
