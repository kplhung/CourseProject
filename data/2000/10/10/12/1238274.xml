        <p>The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said the musicians -- Jeff Timmons, Nick Lachey, Drew Lachey and Justin Jeffre -- breached their contract last year when they fired their manager, Paris D'Jon, and his company, Top 40 Entertainment.</p>
        <p>But John J. Rosenberg, a lawyer for the musicians, said the group had adequate grounds to fire Mr. D'Jon and the management company He added that he planned to file a counter suit showing that the group's success had been ''achieved despite and not because of the efforts'' of Mr. D'Jon and Top 40.</p>
