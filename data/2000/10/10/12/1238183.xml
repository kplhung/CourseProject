        <p>The salvos of attack ads and cries of foul reverberate daily here in the Sixth Congressional District, one of the  battleground contests for control of the House, where an armada of outside special-interest groups are outspending the candidates themselves in the most expensive Congressional race in state history.</p>
        <p>''The independent groups are having it out right here,'' said former Representative Scotty Baesler, a Democrat running once more for his old House seat in a contest that used to cost less than $1 million to settle but that this year is raging at about $6 million.</p>
        <p>''And, no question, the No. 1 fight is the insurance companies versus the doctors,'' Mr. Baesler said of the flurries of punch-and-counterpunch advertisements that began flooding television in the summer.</p>
        <p>The health care issue is more starkly defined in this central-Kentucky district than anywhere else in the nation because the incumbent Republican, Representative Ernie Fletcher, is a physician who has been cut off from fresh financing by the Kentucky Medical Association, which helped get him elected two years ago by stirring $600,000 in donations from the medical profession.</p>
        <p>The unusual shunning this year was prompted by what Dr. Fletcher calls his ''vote of conscience'' but what critics from the association call a double-cross on a 1998 campaign promise to support the sort of patients' bill of rights legislation favored by the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>''Of the now 28 attack ads run against me since January, probably a half or more have been about health care,'' said the congressman, who, as a 47-year-old former fighter pilot, seems up to the electoral dogfight.</p>
        <p>''We play tough, too,'' he noted of the advertising blitz that finds voters complaining of civic shell shock.</p>
        <p>Congressman Fletcher supported a House Republican leadership bill that would have restricted patients' ability to sue H.M.O.'s. He contends that the A.M.A.-backed bill would have left employers open to formidable litigation and caused the number of uninsured to increase. (Neither measure has been able to make it out of Congress, where a conference committee remains deadlocked.)</p>
        <p>But Mr. Baesler, a 59-year-old lawyer and tobacco farmer who was Lexington mayor for 10 years, has been hammering at the incumbent with this issue, from formal debates to the homey bluegrass Outhouse Blowout fall festival.</p>
        <p>''Ernie not only switched,'' Mr. Baesler said, ''but he claims he voted for the real thing when he voted for his leaders' substitute, which is basically sponsored by the insurance companies.''</p>
        <p>After three terms in the House, Mr. Baesler left to challenge Senator Jim Bunning, to whom he lost by only  a percentage point in the 1998 general election. Now Dr. Fletcher accuses him of crass opportunism in doubling back on his old seat. The incumbent says Mr. Baesler mainly wants to pay off political debts and revive his career.</p>
        <p>''Scotty's a perpetual candidate,'' Dr. Fletcher said. ''It's pretty clear he didn't have the passion for this job that I have and that his focus was on something else.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Baesler seems more than avid about running, emphasizing that his party has a good chance of regaining the House and that the issues, from prescription drugs to Social Security, from gun control to education, are dear to his agenda.</p>
        <p>The district is a 19-county swath around Lexington, one-third of it rural. Far more than in other House contests, the candidates are being blistered by campaign advertisements from each other and from independent pressure groups including big labor and the national gun and abortion-issue antagonists. The outsiders are trying to prove crucial in settling House control and so compound their influence.</p>
        <p>Enrollment here is heavily Democratic, but voters tend toward the conservative. And the race includes a perennial rogue candidate, Gatewood Galbraith, who shadows the two big-spending rivals like a gleeful mendicant. He says his one costly campaign graphic is the $1.93 ''for sale'' sign he tears up before the voters to show that he is not.</p>
        <p>''They're telling the truth on each other,'' Mr. Galbraith said of the nasty exchanges by the major-party nominees.</p>
        <p>No one knows his effect on the race, but Mr. Galbraith showed he was no laughing matter when he ran for governor last year and drew 15 percent statewide on the Reform line and 31 percent in the Sixth District.</p>
        <p>The race remains close, with polls suggesting that Mr. Baesler may trail by a few points and that about 8 percent are undecided. Another unknown factor is the effect of the attack ads that rain down each campaign day. Scotty Baesler ''has a problem with the truth,'' sounds a typical Republican burst. Ernie Fletcher ''is bought and sold by the pharmaceutical companies,'' comes the Democrats' return round.</p>
        <p>''We've never seen this kind of thing before,'' said Amy Walter, a House specialist with The Cook Political Report, underlining how early and unrelenting the advertisements had been in this relatively inexpensive media market. ''Both candidates are going to come out of this pretty bloodied.''</p>
        <p>The outside groups have put the contest ''clearly on a different level,'' Congressman Fletcher said. ''But I think people have kind of dulled their hearing on these ads.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baesler wonders whether the advertisements have blown fair criticism out of bounds.</p>
        <p>''People now think 'nasty' encompasses everything that's not real policy,'' he said. ''If you just show yourself up there walking through the flowers, that's policy. If you try to do comparatives, that's nasty.''</p>
