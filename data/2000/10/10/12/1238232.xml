        <p>They celebrated 75 years of Rangers history last night at Madison Square Garden when Manhattan's hockey team won its first home game of the 2000-1 season. It only seemed as if Mark Messier had been away that long. Nearing his 40th birthday, Messier is only slightly more than half as old as the franchise.</p>
        <p>In the three years of his exile to Vancouver, many of the New York players missed the captain at least a little. Most of the fans missed him even more than that. And the team kept missing the playoffs. So last night's ceremony and celebration made it seem like a homecoming game: nostalgic and optimistic at the same time. And Messier scored a fluky goal in a 3-1 victory over Montreal. Back to the future, indeed.</p>
        <p>''I was nervous at the start,'' said Messier, who was greeted with the music of ''Ode to Joy'' when he took the ice. ''So much emotion in the crowd.'' His goal, the game winner, came on a power play in the third period when his pass from behind the goal line deflected off a defenseman and past the Canadiens' goalie, Jeff Hackett. ''The hockey gods must have been looking over us tonight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many from the Ranger pantheon appeared before the face-off amid clouds of artificial smoke and cut-out replicas of nearby skyscrapers. Leading the parade was Mike Keenan, the coach of the Stanley Cup champions of 1994. Conspicuously missing was Neil Smith, the general manager for the past 11 seasons, who was dismissed last spring.</p>
        <p>There were three goalies, led by Chuck Rayner, walking with a cane instead of a big paddle, along with Gump Worsley and Ed Giacomin. Next came the defensemen, including Harry Howell, now back with the team as a scout. And then the forwards, among them Andy Bathgate and the Goal-a-Game line of Vic Hadfield, Jean Ratelle and Rod Gilbert.</p>
        <p>Clint Smith, from the 1940 champions, shook hands with Messier, from the 1994 champions, Smith with the white hair, Messier with the glistening dome. Messier and his teammates wore their dark blue jerseys, usually seen on the road in the modern era but used as home attire in distant decades. When Messier's name was announced, he smiled broadly several times and also tensed his facial features under shining eyes to fight back emotions. He turn and saluted the crowd.</p>
        <p>Someone asked Messier what he was laughing about after the national anthem and he said it was the singer, John Amirante, who served in the same role when Messier played here from 1991 through 1997. You know it is an important game, Messier said, when Amirante's fists clench and he stands on his toes for the high notes of the song. That's the way it was last night.</p>
        <p>At the end of the ceremony, Messier shook hands with all the old Rangers and embraced Keenan. Messier waxed mystical at times, recalling how the stars were all in line for the championship of 1994 and how this season's lesser group must play with ''every ounce of fiber of our souls.''</p>
        <p>Many of his fans took their No. 11 jerseys out of storage and wore them like holy vestments. One of them was Sherri Ricciardelli of Bloomfield, N.J., who wore a Messier jersey (with the captain's ''C,'' of course) that belonged to her friend, Michael Taliercio, of the same town.</p>
        <p>Taliercio said he got the shirt as a Christmas gift in 1993 from his parents. No one has worn it, he said, since Messier left as a free agent in 1997 amid a ruptured relationship with the Garden management.</p>
        <p>''I put it in the attic in storage,'' Taliercio said. ''I just got it out. He will restore the pride in wearing the Ranger jersey.''</p>
        <p>Ricciardelli added: ''He gets the whole team riled up. He gets the fans riled up.''</p>
        <p>They were among the first fans through the doors last night. Taliercio pulled up his left pant leg to show a colorful tattoo of the Ranger logo on his calf. After a brief stop at the concession stand, they headed toward the rink boards for a close look at Messier in the warm-up skate.</p>
        <p>When he scored in the third period, Messier threw back his head and smiled and the fans chanted ''Messier! Messier! Messier!'' He had 100 tickets of his own last night, but this game was attended by 18,200 of his closest friends.</p>
        <p>Over all, the atmosphere around the rink is much different from nine years ago, when Messier first arrived from Edmonton, a mere pup at the age of 30. Back then, the Rangers had been without a championship since 1940. The yearning and impatience created an air of perennial pressure. Since Messier, Keenan and Neil Smith fashioned the championship of 1994, the fans have witnessed six years of decline and decay. Keenan left first, followed by Messier three years later, followed by Smith three years after him. That old belief about how ''New York fans will not stand for a rebuilding era'' has been contradicted by events.</p>
        <p>The fans have continued to pay top dollar to watch a diminishing product. Rebuilding on an old cornerstone would represent an improvement over deterioration. A playoff berth this spring is a reasonable goal. A victory in a tournament round might be too much to ask, immediately. Another Cup championship in the Messier era? That might be an unreasonable wish. But opening night is for old memories, new beginnings and fresh dreams.</p>
