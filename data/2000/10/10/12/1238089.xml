        <p>Go Figure</p>
        <p>As experts see it, the roots of the jigsaw puzzle can be traced to 1693 and the publication of John Locke's ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education,'' which popularized the idea that alphabet blocks could teach reading by harnessing children's natural enthusiasm for play. In the 18th century came the jigsaw puzzle, which has been challenging and entertaining ever since. But there are other types of puzzles, too, among them mechanical puzzles that fall into categories like put-together puzzles, take-apart puzzles, interlocking puzzles and dexterity puzzles. Beginning on Sunday, 342 puzzles -- 237 mechanical and 105 jigsaw -- go on display through Jan. 7 in ''The Art of the Puzzle: Astounding and Confounding'' at the Katonah Museum of Art in Westchester.</p>
        <p>Singing Praise</p>
        <p>Quick, now. Who wrote the city's unofficial song, ''New York, New York''? Those who answered, ''The composer John Kander and the lyricist Fred Ebb,'' can go to the head of the class, or perhaps they'd rather go to Carnegie Hall tomorrow night at 8. That's when Skitch Henderson leads the New York Pops in ''A Kander and Ebb Celebration'' in the first of its seven concerts this season.</p>
        <p>Encore</p>
        <p>The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. The unveiling of the Statue of Liberty in 1886. Brooklyn Bridge on its opening day in 1883. The changing landscape of New York is the subject a show that opens on Saturday at the Museum of the City of New York. With some 55 canvases by painters like the American Impressionist Childe Hassam and the urban realist Theresa Bernstein, ''Painting the Town, Cityscapes of New York,'' seen earlier at the PaineWebber Art Gallery, will run through Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>Song and Dance</p>
        <p>Take a little 19th-century vaudeville. Mix in some Tin Pan Alley. Toss in impresarios like Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., and spice with talent like Sophie Tucker, the Gershwins and Cole Porter. And what have you got? The American musical. Beginning tomorrow, the performers, directors, composers, lyricists, choreographers and others who created that art form will be the focus of an exhibition at East Haddam Town Hall Annex across the street from the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn. A Smithsonian exhibition, ''Red, Hot and Blue: A Salute to American Musicals,'' runs there through Dec. 17. At the Opera House, Cole Porter's 1936 musical, ''Red, Hot and Blue!'' opens tomorrow and runs through Dec. 31.</p>
