        <p>Creditors of South Korea's ailing Daewoo Motor Company will consider making additional loans to the carmaker after receiving the company's self-rescue plans, Korea Development Bank said. The automaker has said it needs an additional 450 billion won ($402.1 million) by the end of this year to stay in business. The state-run bank and four other creditor banks provided Daewoo Motor with 100 billion won ($89.4 million) earlier this week as part of a previously agreed financing package. While Daewoo Motor said it would submit a rescue plan soon, 135 executives at the carmaker resigned in a gesture to aid the company's restructuring. Daewoo was placed under a debt workout program in August 1999.</p>
