        <p>Teenage Ensemble Heard, Not Seen</p>
        <p>BARRY P. SPANIER went to an orchestra rehearsal on Tuesday night. Only 60 players. The New York University String Orchestra -- violins, violas, cellos.</p>
        <p>How different it was from the group he was conducting last month. Leaving N.Y.U. behind -- he is the director of the New York University Center for Music Performance -- he took his baton to Australia and became the artistic director of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Band, a marching ensemble of 2,000 teenage musicians that was heard but not seen.</p>
        <p>''Yet another NBC story,'' he said. ''The rest of the world saw it, but the American audience did not. The actual opening ceremony, when NBC showed it 15 hours later, they cut out the band segment.''</p>
        <p>So the American audience did not see Mr. Spanier's proudest moment: a band large enough to fill nearly 20  symphony orchestras, with student musicians from more than 20 countries, standing shoulder to shoulder in 11 lines, each longer than a football field. Mr. Spanier conducted from a ladder and rehearsed in English, knowing that there were translators (along with seven assistant conductors) among the trumpeters, trombone players and drummers. ''When we were speaking in pretty basic terms, no problem,'' he said. ''When we were trying to describe something subtle, I would finish and the Osaka translator would get on the microphone.''</p>
        <p>In-Line Reviews Of a Movie Unseen</p>
        <p>PENN JILLETTE, the talkative half of the Penn and Teller comedy-and-magic team, was waving a ticket and saying he was at the movie theater because ''GILBERT GOTTFRIED gave me a free ticket.'' Mr. Gottfried was right behind him, shouting that the film was ''tense, taut and gripping.''</p>
        <p>But he had yet to see the film. They were carrying on as they went into a screening of ROBERT ALTMAN'S ''Dr. T and the Women'' on Tuesday night at the Ziegfeld Theater on West 54th Street. Elsewhere in the theater were the stars of the film -- RICHARD GERE, FARRAH FAWCETT, SHELLEY LONG, LAURA DERN, KATE HUDSON and ANDY RICHTER -- along with a crowd that included LAUREN BACALL, GLENN CLOSE and HEIDI KLUM.</p>
        <p>Ms. Long was talking in character, and when she was asked about working with Mr. Altman on a film set in Dallas, her reply was a magnolias-and-oil-money drawl. ''I love the way he works,  y'all,'' she said. She also said that there was nothing new about one sound -- without words -- that she makes in the film. ''I have used the horse neigh for years,'' she said. ''When I was doing an intro for Second City, I'd say, 'I am going to do a little imitation for you, one of my favorites,' and would do the horse's neigh.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hudson, who is scheduled to be the host of ''Saturday Night Live'' this week, was wearing a diamond ring on her left hand. Was it an engagement ring from her boyfriend, CHRIS ROBINSON, the lead singer of the Black Crowes? ''Call it what you want to call it,'' she said, and then she was out the door and on her way back to ''Saturday Night Live.''</p>
        <p>Paris Landmarks Au Chocolat</p>
        <p>The chef FRANCOIS PAYARD began building a 1,200-pound chocolate replica of Paris yesterday. He carried scale-model replicas of landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe and the Pyramid at the Louvre into the French Consulate, at 934 Fifth Avenue, and talked about creating them by spraying chocolate.</p>
        <p>Spraying chocolate? With a sprayer?</p>
        <p>''The same thing you use to paint your house with,'' he said. ''But we put hot chocolate and cocoa butter inside.''</p>
        <p>And yes, the 18-foot-long model will look like Paris by the time the guests arrive for a party tonight for a new Web site, 1france.com. ''We will have little street signs,'' he said. ''We went to France to get little street signs.''</p>
