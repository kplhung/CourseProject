        <p>Saturday evening's concert at Weill Hall, an installment in Carnegie Hall's excellent ''Making Music'' series of encounters with composers, brought to the stage a vast array of percussion instruments and, confined by them to a corner, Hans Werner Henze to talk a little with Ara Guzelimian, the hall's artistic adviser, about his ''Cimarron.'' This is the story in music of a Cuban who escaped from slavery to live in the forest, emerged in 1895 to join the war of independence, and was still alive in 1969 to tell the composer his exploits.</p>
        <p>When it was first performed, in 1970, ''El Cimarron'' was thrilling. It featured William Pearson, steadfast and noble (even in wild falsetto) as the protagonist. It had an athletic young percussionist, Stomu Yamashta, leaping around the platform in pursuit of instruments to thwack. It overstepped the boundaries of respectable contemporary music so far as to include warm scents of Cuban dance music and bursts of storming improvisation. And it found its composer caught up in a global idealism.</p>

        <p>Saturday evening's concert at Weill Hall, an installment in Carnegie Hall's excellent ''Making Music'' series of encounters with composers, brought to the stage a vast array of percussion instruments and, confined by them to a corner, Hans Werner Henze to talk a little with Ara Guzelimian, the hall's artistic adviser, about his ''Cimarron.'' This is the story in music of a Cuban who escaped from slavery to live in the forest, emerged in 1895 to join the war of independence, and was still alive in 1969 to tell the composer his exploits.</p>
        <p>When it was first performed, in 1970, ''El Cimarron'' was thrilling. It featured William Pearson, steadfast and noble (even in wild falsetto) as the protagonist. It had an athletic young percussionist, Stomu Yamashta, leaping around the platform in pursuit of instruments to thwack. It overstepped the boundaries of respectable contemporary music so far as to include warm scents of Cuban dance music and bursts of storming improvisation. And it found its composer caught up in a global idealism.</p>
        <p>One question on Saturday night was whether it would still stand up. The answer was simple. Yes.</p>
        <p>''El Cimarron'' lives on partly, but leastly, because it is such a vivid period piece. Its greater strengths have to do with its rooting, however avant-garde and exotic it certainly is, in a tradition close to the composer, its extraordinary sympathy with the character it depicts and the huge encouragement it provides to performers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henze's first idea, he revealed, was for a narrative song cycle, along the lines of Schubert's ''Schone Mullerin,'' but with some social message. It was Hans Magnus Enzensberger, the eventual author of the texts, who suggested the subject of  Esteban Montejo. Having found his hero, Mr. Henze brought him to life.</p>
        <p>Montejo, as he speaks in Mr. Enzensberger's poems, is wonderfully frank, completely unself-conscious. Mr. Henze, by contrast, is an artist of considerable irony. And yet his portrait of Montejo is direct. His vocal writing, although clearly within the stream of German Expressionism, convincingly renders the untutored Caribbean ex-slave, his passions and his strands of simple wisdom, his fears and his dreams.</p>
        <p>The work leaves scope, though, for different interpretations. Gregory Rahming, who performed the role here, was strong and alert but also touching and lovable. There was sweetness in his voice, and even when speaking he was making music. Also impressive was how he made this a drama happening now. He would address himself to one or other of his fellow performers, as if the guitarist, say, had been the plantation overseer, the flutist a revolutionary comrade. It seemed he was living Montejo's memories, even in such a different piece of action as ''El Cimarron'' is.</p>
        <p>He was splendidly supported. David Tannenbaum gave the composer his fragrant and sensuous guitar chords. Camilla Hortenga's flute playing was lyrical and resourcefully varied in color. And from James Baker, the percussionist, came an incisive and evocative ambience.</p>
