        <p>IN the last couple of years, moviegoers have become accustomed to seeing Web site addresses tacked to anything advertising a film, from the movie trailer itself to posters on the sides of city buses. As Hollywood and the Web begin to overlap, each increasingly cranking out technology-driven entertainment, perhaps it is not surprising that Web sites first created to promote new films are now being designed to reinterpret them.</p>
        <p>This spring, Darren Aronofsky, a New York filmmaker with a penchant for blurring worldly reality and otherworldly fantasy in his work, was considering what sort of Web site he wanted for his latest film, ''Requiem for a Dream.'' (The movie is based on the 1978 book of the same name by Hubert Selby Jr.) He decided to break with convention.</p>
        <p>The result is a site that is more of an interactive audiovisual metaphor for the movie's disquieting themes of decay and loss of control than anything else (www.requiemforadream .com). Even maintaining control of the actual site, which at times simulates a computer crash, is intentionally made more difficult to navigate the longer a user is logged on to it.</p>
        <p>And don't look for a trailer for the movie in this nonlinear wash of images, animation and sound. There is no mention of Mr. Aronofsky and his cast. Instead, the film's characters are treated as though they are flesh and blood, with plights as unpredictable as the site itself.</p>
        <p>The film's four main characters -- three young adults in Brooklyn caught up in a dark tangle of illicit drugs and a middle-aged widow addicted to diet pills -- appear on the site. But they are rendered in a melange of visual styles, making them look as if they were snatched from a multimedia exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art rather than from a full-length, commercial film.</p>
        <p>In some instances, the characters speak key portions of dialogue from key scenes. But their appearances are mostly used as visual elements in a Web experience that never plays the same hand twice. There are even links to cheesy Web sites, like one dedicated to helping people overcome Internet addiction, to underscore the film's examination of addiction's effect on its main characters.</p>
        <p>''I had a hard time visualizing what a site on 'Requiem' would be,'' Mr. Aronofsky said, ''except for an electronic billboard, which I wasn't interested in doing.''</p>
        <p>A chance meeting with a London-based Web artist who was seated next to Mr. Aronofsky on a flight led the director to Hi-Res, a Web design house in London that has a reputation for producing bold, cutting-edge online graphics.</p>
        <p>In a matter of weeks, Hi-Res in England and Artisan, the film's distributor in the United States, began using the Internet to collaborate on the site's creation. In the end, and despite some skepticism about departing so radically from movie-related sites, Mr. Aronofsky and Artisan executives said they were very pleased with the Web site.</p>
        <p>''I'm really impressed with their interpretation of the movie,'' Mr. Aronofsky said. ''I took a book and tried to interpret it into a movie. They took a movie and interpreted it into a Web site.''</p>
        <p>Florian Schmitt, the creative director for new media at Hi-Res, said in a telephone interview that he could not have been happier with the result of his company's collaboration with Artisan and Mr. Aronofsky.</p>
        <p>''It was a dream,'' he said. ''We wanted to transfer what we got out of the film to a different medium and then superimpose on that the whole general theme of the film, which is decay. It's basically sort of an attempt to do a narrative on the Web.''</p>
        <p>Amorette Jones, executive vice president of worldwide marketing for Artisan, said she hoped that by the time ''Requiem'' went into wide release on Oct. 27, the site would have found an audience and helped stir an audience to the film that inspired the Web site.</p>
        <p>Toby Miller, a professor of cinema studies at New York University, said he was not surprised to see the film industry beginning to appropriate Internet style and iconography.</p>
        <p>''Web designers are seen as cutting edge in the electronic arts,'' he said. ''It is a completely natural thing for Hollywood to say, 'These guys are on to something. How do we get a piece of that?' ''</p>
