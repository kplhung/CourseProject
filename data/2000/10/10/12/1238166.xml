      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Federal Communications Commission is considering issuing new rules today that would take a step toward forcing commercial landlords to open their buildings to almost any communications carrier that wants access to their tenants, according to people close to the commission.</p>
        <p>As new forms of digital communication have swept the nation and hundreds of companies have emerged to provide them, landlords of apartment buildings and office towers have had an almost inviolable right to determine which companies may set up shop inside their properties.</p>
        <p>Now that may begin to change. Government officials and industry executives said commission members and their staffs were still battling over the proposals yesterday afternoon and it was possible the F.C.C. could postpone any action. But whether the issue is addressed today or in the near future, the battle lines have been drawn.</p>
        <p>Consider 450 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, a building near 44th Street that includes the offices of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, a law firm, and Cline Davis &amp; Mann, an advertising agency. Hines Interests, the building's manager, holds stakes in Broadband Office and Allied Riser Communications, young companies that wire office buildings and offer advanced communications services. Hines has allowed the two to install equipment at 450 Lexington and has yet to give other carriers the same access.</p>
        <p>Davis Polk and Cline Davis refused to comment, as did Broadband Office. But communications companies that think they are being shut out, as well as some consumer advocates, have not hesitated to attack a system they say is unfair.</p>
        <p>''Given the paucity of local communications competition that has emerged since the telecommunications deregulation act of 1996, it's absolutely critical to use every mechanism possible to jump-start greater consumer access to multiple telecommunications providers,'' Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, said yesterday. ''This would be one step forward for breaking down barriers to local competition.''</p>
        <p>Others see the matter differently.</p>
        <p>''To us, a building is a community,'' said Steve Peterson, a vice president at Hines, a commercial real estate company based in Houston. ''In Texas alone there are 419 registered CLEC's,'' he added, using industry jargon for competitive local exchange carriers. ''Can we have 419 carriers and their equipment in our building? The answer is no.''</p>
        <p>''We're not trying to exclude anybody,'' he said. ''But we want to make sure that all of the carriers are there for the long haul, and yes, we want to maintain a little bit of control over the process. It's our building, after all.''</p>
        <p>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the commission to foster increased competition in local markets, and the F.C.C. chairman, William E. Kennard, a Democrat, has made that a primary goal.</p>
        <p>But realizing that any attempt to exert direct jurisdiction over landlords would be fraught with political and perhaps legal difficulties, the commission appeared to be leaning toward trying to deal with the controversy indirectly.</p>
        <p>Rather than regulate landlords, the F.C.C. was considering issuing rules that would prohibit carriers from agreeing to exclusive real estate deals, according to industry executives and people close to the commission. Under the proposal, the carriers, who almost always are subject to regulatory certification, would not be allowed to sign a contract under which they would be the only company allowed to install a network in an office building.</p>
        <p>In addition, the commission appeared to be leaning toward requiring communications carriers to share their space within office buildings with competitors.</p>
        <p>To serve business customers who spend thousands of dollars a month on communications services, some companies prefer to install advanced antennas on roofs. Others like to put some sort of switch or router in the basement. Many want to install wiring throughout the building. The landlords control a company's ability to deploy its system.</p>
        <p>If this fight sounds familiar, it should. In many ways, the debate is just the latest variation of AT&amp;T's battle to retain control over Internet services delivered over its cable system, or, for that matter, the fight over whether America Online must open its instant messaging system to rivals.</p>
        <p>With some exceptions, landlords have almost the same power in apartment buildings as in office towers. But the issue has become ripe in the business sector because some carriers prefer to install equipment in the buildings of businesses they serve. Such equipment is generally not required to serve residential consumers.</p>
        <p>The conflict over access to commercial buildings is bubbling over just now because the real estate industry is more involved than ever in the communications business. Landlords are taking financial stakes in new carriers in exchange for giving those carriers the sometimes exclusive right to install equipment.</p>
        <p>Phone giants like Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which already have lines into almost all the roughly 750,000 office buildings across the nation, have not been on the front lines of this debate. Those with complaints are generally smaller, newer companies.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing an increasing amount of landlords who are interested in choice only to the extent that they have taken a financial interest in a carrier,'' said David S. Turetsky, a senior vice president at Teligent Inc., a new local communications company, and a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department. ''What they all have in common is that none of those models respects the ultimate choice of the tenant.''</p>
        <p>Broadband Office was formed by a consortium of real estate companies, together with Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, the venture capital firm. Joey D. Mooring, a spokesman for Allied Riser, said his company had granted warrants, a form of equity ownership similar to stock options, to some real estate companies that have opened their buildings, but would not be specific.</p>
        <p>''Tenants within the buildings should have the ability to choose who their provider is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As a business proposition, lobbyists for the real estate industry tend to agree. But as a matter of regulation, they say the government has no right to tell landlords who can and cannot come in.</p>
        <p>''This is something that's driven by the tenant market, and tenant choice is the way for people in the real estate industry to be successful,'' said Roger Platt, spokesman for the Real Access Alliance. This group, formed by many of the nation's biggest real estate companies, has lobbied the F.C.C. to back off.</p>
        <p>''Building owners are being portrayed as evil characters out of a Dickens novel,'' he said. ''One of the fundamental aspects of being a manager of property is you have the right to both include certain people and to exclude certain individuals. There are narrow constitutional restrictions on that, but otherwise the Constitution is very clear.''</p>
        <p>That argument has found some resonance at the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>At least one commissioner, Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican, has made it clear from the start that the case for forced access is weak at best, said Helgi Walker, a legal adviser to Mr. Furchtgott-Roth. ''Even if such statutory authority were within the discretion of the commission,'' she said, ''the exercise of that discretionary authority would at least raise questions about the constitutionality of its action.''</p>
        <p>Taking a page from AT&amp;T's playbook, the Real Access Alliance has suggested voluntary guidelines for preserving competition. In addition to other rules, the commission may make a point of trying to hold the alliance's members to those commitments. Some communications experts suggested that having taken intermediate efforts would be a necessary building block in any future effort to regulate property owners more directly.</p>
        <p>In the end, however, the companies that have complained appear more interested in getting fast access to buildings than in helping the F.C.C. expand its jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>''The point is really to create a process that shortens something that already works,'' said William J. Rouhana Jr., chairman of Winstar Communications, a new local carrier. ''We get access to a lot of buildings, but it takes us an average of nine months to do it. Almost every landlord starts out wondering if they shouldn't consider doing an exclusive, and once that's off the table then the whole process is shortened.''</p>
