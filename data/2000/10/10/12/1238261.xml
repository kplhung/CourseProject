        <p>The Swiss bank UBS said its chairman, Alex Krauer, would step down next year and be replaced by Marcel Ospel, the chief executive. Mr. Ospel, 50, left, is expected to be approved as chairman at the April board meeting. Mr. Krauer, 69, put his retirement plans on hold to take over the UBS post in a hurry in 1998. He replaced Mathis Cabiallavetta, who, with three other executives, was forced to resign after the bank lost nearly $750 million on global equity derivatives and hedge fund investments. The board will be asked to elect new American, British and Dutch members to reflect UBS's global reach, the bank said. The American candidate is Lawrence A. Weinbach, 60, chairman and chief operating officer of the Unisys Corporation.</p>
