        <p>When P. Q. Phan agreed to write a new work for the American Composers Orchestra, he had every intention of creating a work to celebrate the turn of the millennium, exactly as Dennis Russell Davies, the orchestra's music director, had requested. The piece, ''When the Worlds Mixed and Time Merged,'' was a contribution to Mr. Davies's three-year ''Millennium Snapshots'' series, an exploration of musical responses to some of the historical events and social trends of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>But when one of life's darker themes, racist violence, veered uncomfortably close to Mr. Phan, the work became something more tense and personal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phan, who was born in South Vietnam in 1962 and has lived in the United States since 1982, composed the work for an installment called ''Pacifica,'' a program of works by Asian-American composers and Americans influenced by Asian music. Mr. Davies is to conduct the concert on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>The commission is also part of Music Alive, a new residency program sponsored by Meet the Composer in a partnership with the American Symphony Orchestra League. The program has included two weeks of workshops with high school and college composition students and meetings with immigrant groups, a part of the program particularly close to his heart.</p>
        <p>''They understand that being an immigrant is not a bad thing,'' Mr. Phan, 38, said last week after meeting in the Bronx with a group from several countries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phan, a cheerful, animated speaker whose English is only slightly accented, said he thought that he was fully acclimated to American life in the spring of 1999, when he began work on ''When the Worlds Mixed.'' He was teaching at the University of Illinois in Urbana and was about to move to his current teaching position at Indiana University in Bloomington. He had outlined a properly celebratory overture and dance for Mr. Davies in which Vietnamese folk themes were woven through a densely harmonized Western orchestral fabric.</p>
        <p>But just as the work was taking shape, Benjamin Smith, a white supremacist, went on a three-day shooting spree, with Asians, blacks and Jews as his targets. A Taiwanese man was shot in the leg just a block away Mr. Phan's office in Urbana. The next morning a Korean graduate student at Indiana University was shot dead in Bloomington.</p>
        <p>''This event turned the direction of my piece completely,'' he said. ''It still begins with a joyful overture, but when it gets to the dance, it is interrupted with music that is truly dissonant and chaotic. That's about the shootings. I felt as though, after 18 years of establishing a good foundation for my life in America, suddenly I might be in danger because I am Asian. I felt that the music I was writing had to reflect that.''</p>
        <p>The work is not entirely bleak: it ends with a fanfare that symbolizes hope. Still, it came as a surprise to Mr. Davies, whose first encounter with Mr. Phan's work was a 1993 orchestral piece called ''The Race of Gods,'' which the conductor described as ''skillful and witty'' and ''the music of a young man who was feeling optimistic, welcomed and able to explore and develop his talent'' in a new world.</p>
        <p>''When you commission a work for a program like 'Pacifica,' '' Mr. Davies said, ''the pieces you get aren't usually about the dark side. But these murders had an enormous effect on Phan, and this piece is about his reaction. It deals with his inner feelings and fears about being an immigrant and being confronted with the violence that we all know is in an industrial society where people can get their hands on weapons.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Phan has known violence and terror. He was born in January 1962 in Da Nang, the strategically important coastal city in what was then South Vietnam. Among his earliest memories are being shelled two or three times a week by the North Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>''I was only 6,'' he said. ''But believe me, a 6-year-old kid in Vietnam knows more than an 18-year-old in America. I don't mean he's smarter, I mean about life and death. At first we would run into a fortress to hide during the rocket attacks, but eventually we thought if we were going to die anyway, why run?''</p>
        <p>During the Vietnam War Mr. Phan's parents supplied food, clothing, laundry services and building materials to the American military, so when Da Nang fell, the family moved to Saigon and took on new identities. Mr. Phan, whose initials stand for Phuc Quang, has six siblings, two of whom immigrated to the United States before the end of the war. The rest of the family eventually followed -- his parents, now in their 80's, live in California -- but not without difficulty. In 1976 Mr. Phan, his parents and four of his siblings tried to escape Vietnam by boat but were caught and imprisoned.</p>
        <p>''It was an experience that was truly awful,'' he said of his six months in a Vietnamese jail. ''But I would not trade anything for it now. I know that sounds strange, but I believe that this experience made an impact on me and helped me become the person I am today.''</p>
        <p>Upon his release Mr. Phan studied  architecture but was drawn to the Western symphonic music he heard on the radio. He taught himself to play the piano and began composing music so he would have something to practice. ''I know that sounds stupid,'' he said. ''How can you write music in order to teach yourself music? But since I was not in the conservatory, I had access to only a limited number of scores. I hardly knew about Beethoven or Mozart. I would ask my friends who were musicians for scores, and they would lend them to me for a day, which was enough time for me to copy them by hand. And after a while I began making up my own music.''</p>
        <p>To do so he cut a wooden matchbox into a five-pointed stylus to draw staff lines on paper he bought on the black market. He also went to the national library, where he borrowed Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestration primer, translated into Vietnamese, to learn more about instrumentation. By 1978 he had completed a full-scale work, a piano concerto he describes as a cross between Chopin and Liszt, ''something I would only show people now for a laugh at a party.''</p>
        <p>In 1982 Mr. Phan left Vietnam for California, where he attended a community college and spent a year learning English. He also composed and performed another piano concerto, still using Romantic models, and enrolled at Loma Linda University, where he had cafeteria and maintenance jobs, and also worked at a poultry farm to earn his tuition.</p>
        <p>He completed his undergraduate work at the University of Southern California and then became a student of the composer William Albright at the University of Michigan. There he earned two master's degrees (in composition and ethnomusicology) and a doctorate (in composition). ''I have enough degrees to cover my bathroom,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phan's early breaks came when his works were performed at  small new-music festivals at which the Kronos Quartet was among the performers. The Kronos commissioned ''Memoirs of a Lost Soul,'' a work in which two of the four movements combine the quartet with traditional Vietnamese instruments.</p>
        <p>A quartet-only movement from that work, ''Tragedy at the Opera'' -- inspired by a performance of traditional Vietnamese opera that Mr. Phan attended during which the principal singer died onstage -- is included in the Kronos's 10-disc anthology ''25 Years'' on Nonesuch. Another half-dozen of Mr. Phan's chamber works, composed between 1993 and 1999, are included on a new CRI recording, ''Banana Trumpet Games.'' All told his recorded works show him to be a composer concerned with the tougher aspects of contemporary musical language.</p>
        <p>''I think we have gone through a long period of having too many easy pieces,'' he said of the current dominance of neo-Romantic works. ''It makes me feel that while the Europeans are constantly pushing for something complex, we are becoming too soft. So I feel like I need to write music that's still American, still part of my Vietnamese heritage, but pushing toward the complexity of European music.''</p>
