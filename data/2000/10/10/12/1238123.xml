        <p>Editorial urges new Yugoslav Pres Vojislav Kostunica to reconsider his reluctance to detain ex-Pres Slobodan Milosevic and turn him over to international tribunal; urges he promptly oust many Milosevic cronies still wielding pwoer in state industries and universities, while resisting pressure to make patronage appointments or act outside rule of law; urges him to temper his nationalism and welcome foreign investment; backs Pres Clinton's plan to lift most economic sanctions</p>

        <p>Forcing Slobodan Milosevic to acknowledge defeat and resign Yugoslavia's presidency was only the first step in what will be a long and difficult process of undoing the damage of 13 years of war and dictatorship. The new President, Vojislav Kostunica, will have to dismantle still dangerous elements of the Milosevic political machine and security apparatus even as he vies with more radical elements of his own coalition impatient with his commitment to constitutional change.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, some of Mr. Milosevic's allies in Serbia's holdover government threatened to ignore the decisions of Mr. Kostunica and his coalition and called on Serbian police forces to retake control of government buildings seized by demonstrators during last week's popular revolt. Mr. Kostunica should reconsider his reluctance to detain Mr. Milosevic, and should turn him over to the international tribunal in The Hague that last year indicted him for war crimes. Mr. Kostunica should also move promptly to remove the many Milosevic cronies still wielding power in state industries and the universities. They present a threat to democratic change.</p>

        <p>Forcing Slobodan Milosevic to acknowledge defeat and resign Yugoslavia's presidency was only the first step in what will be a long and difficult process of undoing the damage of 13 years of war and dictatorship. The new President, Vojislav Kostunica, will have to dismantle still dangerous elements of the Milosevic political machine and security apparatus even as he vies with more radical elements of his own coalition impatient with his commitment to constitutional change.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, some of Mr. Milosevic's allies in Serbia's holdover government threatened to ignore the decisions of Mr. Kostunica and his coalition and called on Serbian police forces to retake control of government buildings seized by demonstrators during last week's popular revolt. Mr. Kostunica should reconsider his reluctance to detain Mr. Milosevic, and should turn him over to the international tribunal in The Hague that last year indicted him for war crimes. Mr. Kostunica should also move promptly to remove the many Milosevic cronies still wielding power in state industries and the universities. They present a threat to democratic change.</p>
        <p>The Milosevic years brutalized and corrupted Yugoslavia's politics, ruined its economy and poisoned its relations with Balkan neighbors and the democratic West. To undo the damage Mr. Kostunica must act quickly, but also judiciously, resisting pressure to make patronage appointments or act outside the rule of law. Yugoslavia suffered enough from those methods during the Milosevic era.</p>
        <p>Yugoslavia's economy is now more than a decade behind the rest of Central and Eastern Europe in making the transition to market capitalism. Most of the privatizations carried out in the Milosevic era consisted of handouts to political supporters. Long before tough investment sanctions were imposed last year, foreign businesses were avoiding Yugoslavia, put off by its politicized courts, poor fiscal management and rusting industries. Under the best of circumstances, Yugoslavia will have a hard time catching up with those countries that have gone through a decade of generally successful reforms, like Poland and the Baltic states. At worst, Yugoslavia's economy could follow Russia's path to corruption and decline.</p>
        <p>To avoid that, Mr. Kostunica will have to temper his Serbian nationalism with pragmatism and welcome substantial foreign investment. Remaining state-controlled businesses should be rapidly sold off. Milosevic-era privatizations should be investigated and corrupt deals renegotiated.</p>
        <p>The United States can help Mr. Kostunica by following Europe's lead and lifting most of the economic sanctions imposed during the Milosevic years, a step President Clinton plans to take today. Substantial emergency assistance will also be needed this winter. Washington should be generous.</p>
