        <p>ONCE or twice a week last spring, Chris Dailey, a sales manager at a Web development firm in New York, exchange e-mail notes with an 11th-grade student at a Queens high school.

        <p>ONCE or twice a week last spring, Chris Dailey, a sales manager at a Web development firm in New York, exchange e-mail notes with an 11th-grade student at a Queens high school. The two had been matched up by iMentor, an online mentoring organization in New York City, based on the student's interest in the Web and graphic design.</p>
        <p>Although they had not yet met face to face, they shared details about their lives during their first online encounter. ''He sent me a poem telling me the facts and figures about his life,'' Mr. Dailey said, ''and he also talked about his fear of failure. It blew me away that he was able to share that kind of stuff, and when someone does that, you can share yours.''</p>
        <p>The convenience of e-mail, as well as its ability to bridge geographic barriers, has caught the attention of a growing number of mentoring organizations, groups that foster relationships between working professionals and middle- and high-school students who are seeking career advice.</p>
        <p>In the last year, online mentoring organizations like iMentor (www.imentor.org) and NetMentors.Org (www.netmentors.org) have sprung up to provide mentoring programs for schools and after-school groups. And some mentoring groups that have been around for a while, like the National Mentoring Partnership are starting to add online mentoring to the services they offer.</p>
        <p>Although career guidance is usually the premise of the relationship, it often spills over into other areas of the participants' lives. ''I have to admit that when I first heard about e-mail mentoring, I didn't think it held much promise,'' said Rebecca Saito, a youth development specialist for the Minneapolis schools. ''But having participated in a few programs, I do think the possibility exists that some people will be able to form emotional connections online, and sometimes they can be even stronger than those  conducted face to face.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Saito -- who is also an adviser for the Digital Heroes Campaign, a new mentoring program by People magazine and America Online that will have celebrities act as online mentors for youths -- said such programs would also help rural youths who might otherwise find it hard to get advice from adults in various careers.</p>
        <p>Youth development experts say it is not clear whether e-mail mentoring relationships can effectively substitute for face-to-face mentoring. In fact, many online mentoring programs incorporate several in-person meetings into the process. But programs largely based on e-mail do make it possible for many people who would not otherwise participate to get involved.</p>
        <p>One such person is Amy Vernick, a lawyer in New York who is a volunteer for iMentor. She exchanged e-mail notes about once a week last semester with a student who had moved to New York from Venezuela. She said her career would have prohibited her from participating in an offline mentoring program. ''It's so much easier to e-mail than it is to pick up the phone or get together,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One teacher who directs students to iMentor is Dominick Camastro at Erasmus Hall High School. The mentoring takes place online. Otherwise, he said, ''I can't imagine some of the professionals having the time to talk to the kids in my class on a regular basis.''</p>
        <p>E-mail mentoring programs can offer volunteers duties that require fixed amounts of time. ''Online programs are a little less threatening because there's usually a mandated start and finish,'' said David Moen, program director at Youth Trust in Minneapolis, which creates mentoring partnerships between schools and companies like Cargill, General Mills and Best Buy.</p>
        <p>Most e-mail mentoring programs organize only two or three actual meetings per semester. ''I think that what prevents a lot of people from getting involved with mentoring is this overwhelming feeling of responsibility,'' Mr. Dailey said. ''iMentor sets it up so you're not obligated to meet more than three times, so you feel like a true mentor as opposed to a quasi parent.''</p>
        <p>Many people find that they are more comfortable communicating by e-mail.</p>
        <p>Dan Bassill, president and chief executive of Cabrini Connections, a mentoring and tutoring organization in Chicago, said: ''I think e-mail lets you focus more clearly on what you're talking about because you're not as focused on personal dynamics.''</p>
        <p>That proved to be true for Lisette Rodriguez, who participated in an online mentoring program last year, when she was a senior at Central Park East Secondary  School in Manhattan. ''I'm really quick to judge people I meet in person,'' Ms. Rodriguez said, ''but when you write to someone you can't always form an impression right away. I'm also kind of shy, and I'll say more  in writing than I will in person.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rodriguez said she had exchanged e-mail notes with her mentor, Heather Butts, a lawyer at PricewaterhouseCoopers, at least once a day over four months, and that they had met in person three times. Ms. Butts advised Ms. Rodriguez on things like whether she should go to the prom without a date and how to get along with her sisters.</p>
        <p>''We got to know each other much better than we thought we would,'' Ms. Butts said. ''It turned out to be much more personal than career counseling.''</p>
        <p>Despite the potential of e-mail mentoring, some face-to-face mentoring organizations are reluctant to sing its praises.</p>
        <p>''We don't really have relationships that are exclusively pen pal relationships,'' said Judy Vredenburgh, president of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, based in Philadelphia. ''E-mail is a means for furthering a relationship, but I don't think it's a substitute for in-person time together.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Saito, of Minneapolis, said: ''My guess is that we'll find e-mail works best when it's used to enhance an existing web of support. Years and years of research say that kids need a whole bunch of different relationships and caring opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Evaluating mentors will become harder as e-mail mentoring expands. ''One of the dreaded fears that any organization has is  the recruitment of mentors that will exploit children,'' said Ira Schwarz, dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Pennsylvania. ''All you need are one or two horrific incidents to reveal that the recruiting and screening was inadequate to shut a program down, and the lack of face-to-face  recruiting raises those risks.''</p>
        <p>The screening process at iMentor is modeled after that at offline mentoring programs, said Richard Buery, the organization's co-founder and executive director. Applicants provide three references, who are interviewed by phone, and iMentor confirms the applicant's employment and performs a criminal background check. Applicants are also interviewed over the phone and go to iMentor's office for training.</p>
        <p>Some online mentoring programs maintain their participants' anonymity to protect their privacy. And the programs generally keep track of the e-mail notes sent back and forth in case any problems arise. Those procedures, of course, could also diminish the capacity for personal connections.</p>
        <p>Managing the expectations of both the mentors and the children they advise through e-mail is another challenge for online mentoring groups. ''Just as with face-to-face mentoring, people expect an immediate connection to happen,'' said Susan Mason, vice president of the National Mentoring Partnership, in Alexandria, Va. ''We've had to alert mentors to expect and be comfortable with the idea that the relationship evolves over time, and that it usually begins with just a paragraph or two.''</p>
        <p>The National Mentoring Partnership, which is a partner in People magazine's Digital Heroes Campaign, has published a set of standards for the recruitment, training and support of mentors, as well as guidelines on confidentiality and liability, on its Web site (www.mentoring.org). ''We feel  quite confident that the results of the Digital Heroes program will be excellent,'' Ms. Mason said, ''and we'll make the program model available to anyone who wants to  make an online mentoring program work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dailey, the sales manager who mentored the Queens high school student, said he believed that the relationship was meaningful to both of them, even though the bulk of it occurred online and was over in a few months. He has since begun mentoring another student.</p>
        <p>''Some people wonder how attached you can get,'' he said, ''but giving someone exposure to another career or another point of view can have a tremendous impact. I know it's had a major impact on my life.''</p>
