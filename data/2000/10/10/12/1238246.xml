        <p>The chill and anticipation of October baseball sends Mike Piazza back, way back, to grainy black-and-white videotapes, to players whom he has only read about or heard about from his father. Back, way back, to fleeting details about other players' triumphs that have long been his hopes and that can make even a $91 million man tingle.</p>
        <p>Piazza was more like a 12-year-old boy than a 32-year-old All-Star catcher when he talked about what it means to wake up on a crisp morning in October and know you are involved in the one of two games being played that day. The season is shrinking and you are still chasing a goal that began in February. Well, for this season. It started a lot earlier than that for everyone, years earlier.</p>

        <p>The chill and anticipation of October baseball sends Mike Piazza back, way back, to grainy black-and-white videotapes, to players whom he has only read about or heard about from his father. Back, way back, to fleeting details about other players' triumphs that have long been his hopes and that can make even a $91 million man tingle.</p>
        <p>Piazza was more like a 12-year-old boy than a 32-year-old All-Star catcher when he talked about what it means to wake up on a crisp morning in October and know you are involved in the one of two games being played that day. The season is shrinking and you are still chasing a goal that began in February. Well, for this season. It started a lot earlier than that for everyone, years earlier.</p>
        <p>That was why Piazza mentioned the names of Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle as the players he thinks about during the playoffs. They were winners. Piazza switched to basketball and mentioned Bill Russell and Michael Jordan and their incredible exploits. They are all legendary players, remembered in a way Piazza could be remembered one day. And they are all champions, which Piazza is not yet. That pushes him.</p>
        <p>''The cool thing I like about the postseason is it goes back to the 20's, the 30's, the 40's, the 50's. You know what I mean?'' Piazza said. ''That's what it reminds me of. It goes back to the time when you had great players like Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle. That's what is brought out at this time of the year. That's everyone's perception of a money player, winning a World Series. That's something that I would really love to experience.''</p>
        <p>For the Mets to experience it, Piazza must guide them. He is their marquee player, the one with the biggest salary and the biggest responsibilities. Piazza started guiding them against the Cardinals immediately last night by rapping Darryl Kile's first pitch past a diving Placido Polanco into left field for a run-scoring double in the first inning. It was the Mets' first run, it was Piazza's first run batted in of the postseason and Mike Hampton sweated out the rest in a 6-2 victory in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>There were seven scoreless innings from Hampton, who survived Jim Edmonds falling about a foot short of a three-run homer in the seventh. Benny Agbayani caught the blast about waist high with his back nearly touching the left-field fence. There were also two hits from Piazza. The revivals by the two Mikes were important developments for the Mets last night in their quest to stop the Cardinals and reach the World Series.</p>
        <p>Before last night, Piazza had more strikeouts (13) than hits (9) in his 47 postseason at-bats with the Mets for a .191 average with 1 homer and 4 runs batted in. He also finished the season by batting .222 with 5 homers in his last 33 games. While it is difficult to malign someone who plays the most demanding position on the field and who was one of the most valuable players in baseball, Piazza's teammates have been waiting for him to do what he did last night, and more. ''Of course, we play well as a team, but we have a couple of guys that have to play well,'' Darryl Hamilton said. ''He's one of them. I'm a firm believer that you pay a guy big money for the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Piazza knows this. He nodded when Hamilton's comments were relayed to him and, 24 hours later, he slapped hits in his first two at-bats. After eight years in the majors, Piazza has 278 homers, 881 R.B.I. and a .328 average and those statistics are superior to those of eight Hall of Fame catchers. Still, in this postseason, Timo Perez has 3 R.B.I., or two more than Piazza. If Piazza wants to be considered a great player, he believes he must help the Mets win a title and then get greedy and add on from there.</p>
        <p>''You've got Bill Russell with the Celtics, Michael Jordan with the Bulls,'' Piazza said. ''That's what you want. Great players are going to make great money. But a money player is going to do something to change things for his team. Some players achieve that and some don't. You'd like to be known as both.''</p>
        <p>So far, Piazza has not been known for both. Maybe he was tired last month because he caught too many innings, and that was why he slumped. Maybe he grew fatigued last October for the same reason, but those excuses are superfluous now. Everyone is tired. The Mets carried the slumping Piazza through a division series where he poked three hits in four games, but they cannot carry him through the N.L.C.S. Someone who is comfortable referring to DiMaggio and Mantle is smart enough to know it has to be the other way around in this series. More like what happened last night when Piazza's bat speed, so slow last weekend, looked quick again.</p>
        <p>The chill and anticipation of October sends Piazza's mind back, but Piazza has the ability to carry that chill and the anticipation into the present. Like DiMaggio and Mantle, like Russell and Jordan, Piazza wants to be remembered as a great player who was also a great champion. Last night, Piazza's quest moved on. The Mets need seven more victories to make it happen.</p>
        <p>''There's no question I want to be like that,'' Piazza said. ''I've got the individual stats and I've made a great living. Everything I want to achieve now is team oriented. That's what drives you. I'm going to do everything in my power to help us keep going.''</p>
