        <p>Knowing how to spell ''wild boar'' in Italian (cin ghiale) won't help you look up Mark Strausman's new restaurant in an old meat-packing plant. People couldn't pronounce it (''chin-gee-AH-lay''), so he spelled it his own way: Chin ghalle. The menu and the design are eclectic (call it New York brasserie). The massive chandeliers are by Johnson Schwinghammer Lighting Consultants in New York City, top; the logo, above right, was by Jake, an Englishman; and acid-etched steel on the bar is from Belgium, as is the glassware, above. Mr. Strausman finds thick glasses comfortable and sexy. ''Thin glass is elegant and fine and modern,'' he said. ''These glasses are like holding on to the past.'' The glassware is in Mr. Strausman's store, Campagna Home, 29 East 21st Street, from $7.50, to $42.50 for a pitcher. Chinghalle opens Oct. 23 at 50 Gansevoort Street (Washington). It is beside another new restaurant, Macelleria (''butcher shop'' in Italian), which is spelled right.</p>
