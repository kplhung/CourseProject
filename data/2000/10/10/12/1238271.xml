        <p>Seattle and the Yankees combined for only 11 hits and two runs in Game 1 of this series, and somehow the game lasted 3 hours 45 minutes, ending at 11:59 p.m. ''I never thought I'd reach the point where I'd say, 'God, we played a three-hour game, wasn't that great?'

        <p>There are two and a half minutes between each half inning because of additional television commercials, a gap so long that Yankees pitcher Denny Neagle would wait a minute or so before going to the mound and beginning his warm-ups.
