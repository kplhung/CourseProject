        <p>Enthusiasts who surf the Internet for bridge-related sites may have several purposes. They may wish to play online. They may wish to kibitz major championship events, preferably with an expert commentary. They may seek a bulletin board or a chat room in the hope of finding a partner for some tournament, to present a point of view, or to ask a question. Or they may be looking for the electronic equivalent of a bridge library.</p>
        <p>An ambitious attempt to provide all these on one site has been developed by Pinhas Romik of Israel. It is called e-bridge, and is accessible at www.e-bridgemaster.com. An e-bridge team with a cosmopolitan makeup scored a convincing victory a month ago in the World Transnational Mixed Teams in Maastricht in the Netherlands. The players were Piotr Gawrys of Poland; Migry Zur-Campanile of Israel; and Sam Lev, Irina Levitina, John Mohan and Jill Meyers, all of the United States.</p>

        <p>An ambitious attempt to provide all these on one site has been developed by Pinhas Romik of Israel. It is called e-bridge, and is accessible at www.e-bridgemaster.com. An e-bridge team with a cosmopolitan makeup scored a convincing victory a month ago in the World Transnational Mixed Teams in Maastricht in the Netherlands. The players were Piotr Gawrys of Poland; Migry Zur-Campanile of Israel; and Sam Lev, Irina Levitina, John Mohan and Jill Meyers, all of the United States.</p>
        <p>In earlier days Levitina won world chess championships while representing the Soviet Union, and he is the only person to have won world titles in both games. On the diagramed deal in Maastricht she sat South and pushed to an optimistic six-diamond contract. Her five-club cue-bid indicated that she had a void in that suit and a powerful hand, so there was a strong case for subsiding when her partner signed off in five diamonds.</p>
        <p>Knowing that South must be void in clubs, West underled his ace. The declarer ruffed, cashed the heart ace and ruffed a heart. She took a successful spade finesse and cashed the heart king, throwing a spade from the dummy. Her next move was to ruff a heart with the diamond 10, and she was happy but not surprised when East was unable to overruff. West's failure to lead a trump originally strongly suggested that he held the queen.</p>
        <p>South had taken six tricks, and the position was this:</p>
        <p>Diagram</p>
        <p>Since East had thrown a club on the fourth round of hearts, South was able to repeat the spade finesse and cash the ace. Then she played safely by finessing the diamond jack and ruffing a club. A crossruff with high trumps gave her the slam.</p>
        <p>If East had thrown a spade on the fourth heart, South would have assumed the likely 3-2 trump split. She would have played another spade, finessing if necessary, and cashed the king and ace of diamonds. Then she would have led side winners to take 12 tricks.</p>
