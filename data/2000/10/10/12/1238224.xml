        <p>Saying that the public needed to know the facts before Election Day, Connecticut's attorney general took the rare step today of issuing a detailed interim report on his investigation into widespread patterns of alleged misconduct, some of it criminal, in Connecticut's sheriff system.</p>
        <p>The attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said he felt compelled to give an accounting of his eight-month investigation into the sheriffs so that voters would be properly informed when they vote next month on a measure to abolish the 298-year-old sheriffs' system.</p>

        <p>Saying that the public needed to know the facts before Election Day, Connecticut's attorney general took the rare step today of issuing a detailed interim report on his investigation into widespread patterns of alleged misconduct, some of it criminal, in Connecticut's sheriff system.</p>
        <p>The attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said he felt compelled to give an accounting of his eight-month investigation into the sheriffs so that voters would be properly informed when they vote next month on a measure to abolish the 298-year-old sheriffs' system.</p>
        <p>The sheriffs, who are elected in each of the state's eight counties,  serve legal papers, guard courthouses and collect judgments.</p>
        <p>Sheriffs and their supporters called the report a political ploy intended to discredit them before the referendum.</p>
        <p>The report recites dozens of allegations of sheriffs' violating state laws, including what it says were illegal weapons purchases by New London County deputy sheriffs and  abuses by several sheriff associations of their tax-exempt status. The report also criticizes the tradition of issuing honorary deputy sheriff's badges to civilians, some of whom, the report says, used them illegally.</p>
        <p>''It presents a clear picture of unwise, improper and sometimes clearly illegal conduct'' by at least six of the state's eight High Sheriffs, Mr. Blumenthal said at a news conference today. ''It involves a pattern of conduct that is out of control and unprofessional.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said some of the violations were so serious that he planned to send his report, once completed, to the Connecticut state's attorney's office and to federal agencies like the Internal Revenue Service for possible criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the state's eight sheriffs issued a statement today that called the report ''ill-timed, incomplete and inaccurate'' and charged Mr. Blumenthal with trying to ''distract'' voters from recognizing the benefits of having county-based sheriffs.</p>
        <p>The most frequent assertion in the report involves the time-worn practice of sheriffs' giving away or selling hundreds of honorary badges to civilians -- Mr. Blumenthal counted 629 honorary badges given by the New Haven County sheriff, Frank J. Kinney. Though he declined to cite specific instances of abuse, Mr. Blumenthal said some people used the badges -- which look real and often sold for $65 to $150 -- to persuade police officers to ignore speeding violations and commit other improprieties.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview today, the Fairfield County sheriff, Charles Valentino, said he gave away or sold dozens of honorary badges and identification cards, for $150 to some people, but only after conducting background checks on people he did not know well. ''We've been doing that for years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The New London County sheriff, Gerry Egan, was criticized in the report for having accepted an illegal  $1,000 campaign contribution from the Fairfield County Sheriff's Association. Mr. Egan said that after he was told the contribution was improper, he gave back the money and paid a $1,150 state fine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said some of the improprieties his investigation uncovered were violations of federal law, a reference most likely directed at Mr. Egan. The report documents allegations that Mr. Egan authorized his deputies and others not employed by his department to use his office to illegally buy guns and high-capacity ammunition magazines for their personal use, though such purchases violate federal law.</p>
        <p>Calls to Mr. Egan's office were referred to Adam Hurtubise, a spokesman for Citizens Opposed to Constitutional Change, a grass-roots campaign to support Connecticut's sheriffs. Mr. Hurtubise would not  comment on the weapons-related allegations against Mr. Egan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal's report also charges that several county sheriff  associations, particularly in Fairfield, New London and New Haven Counties, improperly paid fees for political lobbying and reimbursed sheriffs for business travel for which they also received a stipend. On several occasions, the report said, charitable contributions made to sheriff's departments were not forwarded to charities but were used by the department for political purposes, which Mr. Blumenthal said was a violation of federal law.</p>
        <p>In New London, the sheriff's department used a fake state-tax exemption code to improperly authorize deputies to buy personal items without paying state sales tax, the report said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal defended the timing of the interim report's release, just weeks before the statewide referendum that will decide the sheriffs' future, by arguing that the sheriffs brought it on themselves by delaying his investigation with legal challenges to subpoenas.</p>
        <p>But Sheriff Valentino said he and his colleagues were being used as scapegoats by lawmakers who do not adequately finance their departments. ''They don't tell all the good we did for the state of Connecticut,'' Mr. Valentino said, citing the more than $200 million he said sheriffs had  recovered from fathers owing child support in Connecticut over the last two years. ''We've been changing things. They're not giving us a fair chance.''</p>
