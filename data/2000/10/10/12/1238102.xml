        <p>At a time when an increasing number of people are listening to high-tech radio through the Internet, Sonicbox and Acer are hoping that many people will want to control the process with a gadget that looks like something from the time when radio sets were stuffed with vacuum tubes.</p>
        <p>The device, the Art Deco-style Acer NeWeb  iRhythm ($129.99), can tune in stations in 25 genres, each containing 32 Web radio stations. The iRhythm is three separate devices: a base unit that plugs into the computer, a receiver that attaches to the stereo system and a tuner, called the iM Tuner, developed by the Internet radio service Sonicbox. All the parts are connected wirelessly. But why bother with more hardware? ''It's a lot easier -- that's the bottom line,'' said David Frerichs, vice president of products for Sonicbox.</p>

        <p>The device, the Art Deco-style Acer NeWeb  iRhythm ($129.99), can tune in stations in 25 genres, each containing 32 Web radio stations. The iRhythm is three separate devices: a base unit that plugs into the computer, a receiver that attaches to the stereo system and a tuner, called the iM Tuner, developed by the Internet radio service Sonicbox. All the parts are connected wirelessly. But why bother with more hardware? ''It's a lot easier -- that's the bottom line,'' said David Frerichs, vice president of products for Sonicbox.</p>
        <p>This week, Sonicbox released a lower-cost package similar to the iRhythm. The new Sonicbox K.O. ($79.99) does what the iRhythm does but does not contain the wireless link between the computer and the home stereo system.</p>
        <p>Both the K.O. and the iRhythm, however, depend on Sonic's Web-based radio channel services. The company offers separate sets of channels for users with dial-up modems and those with high-speed connections. The K.O. and  iRhythm are available from www.sonicbox.com. The iRhythm is also sold through retailers.</p>
