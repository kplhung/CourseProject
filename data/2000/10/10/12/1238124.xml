        <p>Editorial scores Senate's Republican leaders for blocking vote on Rep Charlie Norwood's bipartisan patients' rights bill; warns of growing voter anger over lack of protections against unfair managed-care practices</p>

        <p>Representative Charlie Norwood, the prime sponsor of the bipartisan patients' rights bill that passed the House last year, is hoping to get a Senate vote on the bill before Congress adjourns. The Senate Republicans have been adamantly opposed to the House bill, and instead approved a woefully inadequate measure last year that does not contain the right to hold health plans liable for damages caused by wrongful denial of care.</p>
        <p>Since then, movement on this issue has been stalled. The Clinton administration is expected to issue regulations soon requiring better internal appeals and information for enrollees of health plans, but those rules would not reach as many people or deal with as many problems as the Norwood bill.</p>

        <p>Representative Charlie Norwood, the prime sponsor of the bipartisan patients' rights bill that passed the House last year, is hoping to get a Senate vote on the bill before Congress adjourns. The Senate Republicans have been adamantly opposed to the House bill, and instead approved a woefully inadequate measure last year that does not contain the right to hold health plans liable for damages caused by wrongful denial of care.</p>
        <p>Since then, movement on this issue has been stalled. The Clinton administration is expected to issue regulations soon requiring better internal appeals and information for enrollees of health plans, but those rules would not reach as many people or deal with as many problems as the Norwood bill.</p>
        <p>Voters would be right to blame the Republican leadership for the inaction. Fear of a public reaction might yet push the Republicans to move on this important legislation before the November elections.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Norwood and other backers of the legislation have offered concessions that should make it easier for Republican fence-sitters to support the bill. The comprehensive protections -- such as coverage for all Americans with private insurance, external review of benefit denials, access to specialists and the right to sue health plans for damages -- remain intact. But states would be allowed to seek a waiver of a specific federal standard if state law contains a substantially similar protection. A patient would have to sue in federal court if a health plan decision did not involve medical judgment, and a $5 million cap would be placed on ''statutory damages'' for wanton misconduct by health plans sued in federal court. As an added sweetener to Republicans, the revised bill would extend a pilot program for medical savings accounts, and allow tax credits for small businesses to offer health coverage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norwood is expected to try in the House this week to attach the revised bill to a continuing resolution to finance government agencies as Congress and President Clinton wrestle over several unresolved spending bills. That move might make it hard for the Senate to avoid a vote on the bill. Currently 51 senators, including five Republicans, are on record in favor of the Norwood bill. Other Senate Republicans in tight races would be foolish to continue opposing the bill and thus giving their opponents an issue to use against them.</p>
        <p>Still, the Republican leaders have the ability to defy a majority in the Senate and continue to block good legislation. But in so doing, they will face growing voter anger over the lack of protections against unfair managed-care practices.</p>
