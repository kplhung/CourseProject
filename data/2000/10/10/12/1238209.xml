        <p>Corrections: Oct 11 article referred incompletely to those in prison visiting room when Kenneth Kimes took Court TV reporter hostage: correction officer was also present; article also misstated Kimes's complaint at sentencing hearing; he wanted Court TV to videotape proceedings</p>

        <p>An article yesterday about Kenneth Kimes, a convicted murderer who took a Court TV reporter hostage for four hours at an upstate New York prison, referred incompletely to those who were in the visiting room at the time. In addition to two members of the television crew, a correction officer was there.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated an objection made by Mr. Kimes at his sentencing hearing. He complained because Court TV was barred from videotaping the proceedings, not because Court TV cameras were allowed (they were not).</p>
