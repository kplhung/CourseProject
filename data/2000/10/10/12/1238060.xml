        <p>AS is true for only a handful of 20th-century designers, the hallmark style of Jean-Michel Frank -- his elegance of form, spare geometries and exquisite proportions combined with luxurious materials -- renders his work timeless. Perhaps it was Christie's sale of Frank furniture in May -- or last month's Paris Biennale, with its display of a 1935 room, complete with quilted leather walls, which Frank designed for the Guerlain family -- but Frankmania is in the air again. Robert Couturier, a New York decorator, is one of many who feel an aesthetic debt to the designs of this master, who died in 1941. ''In these days of excessive affluence, it's nice to see luxurious simplicity,'' said Mr. Couturier, who grew up in a Paris apartment decorated with Frank furniture. The designer ''undressed fancy rooms,'' he said, adding, ''He respected the space of a room and never overcrowded it.''</p>
        <p>Although an original lamp of gilded bronze, parchment, rock crystal or leather can cost tens of thousands of dollars, the essence of Frank can be found in a host of new reproductions available anywhere from Chinatown to Pottery Barn, some for less than $100. ''His inspiration is best seen in the simplicity of the lines and attention to materials,'' said Celia Tejada, Pottery Barn's design director.</p>

        <p>AS is true for only a handful of 20th-century designers, the hallmark style of Jean-Michel Frank -- his elegance of form, spare geometries and exquisite proportions combined with luxurious materials -- renders his work timeless. Perhaps it was Christie's sale of Frank furniture in May -- or last month's Paris Biennale, with its display of a 1935 room, complete with quilted leather walls, which Frank designed for the Guerlain family -- but Frankmania is in the air again. Robert Couturier, a New York decorator, is one of many who feel an aesthetic debt to the designs of this master, who died in 1941. ''In these days of excessive affluence, it's nice to see luxurious simplicity,'' said Mr. Couturier, who grew up in a Paris apartment decorated with Frank furniture. The designer ''undressed fancy rooms,'' he said, adding, ''He respected the space of a room and never overcrowded it.''</p>
        <p>Although an original lamp of gilded bronze, parchment, rock crystal or leather can cost tens of thousands of dollars, the essence of Frank can be found in a host of new reproductions available anywhere from Chinatown to Pottery Barn, some for less than $100. ''His inspiration is best seen in the simplicity of the lines and attention to materials,'' said Celia Tejada, Pottery Barn's design director.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Frank would understand the flood of knockoffs. ''Most of Frank's furniture is stripped-down Louis XVI or Empire,'' as Louis Bofferding, a New York antiques dealer, put it.</p>
        <p>1. A 15-inch-high gilded bronze lamp that Frank made around 1937 was in a home in Houston until 1973, when a collector bought it. It is the same design as in the vintage photograph at center, a Parisian drawing room by Frank circa 1930; $38,500 at DeLorenzo, 956 Madison Avenue (75th Street). It sits on Frank's straw-marquetry one-drawer end table made about 1935 ($85,000 at Maison Gerard, 53 East 10th Street). Background: A 43-inch-high three-panel screen of limed oak made in France in the 1940's came from the New York apartment of the late photographer David Seidner. It is unsigned but similar in material to those made by Frank; $6,500 at Liz O'Brien, 800A Fifth Avenue (61st Street).</p>
        <p>2. The Duncan lamp, an open brass square, is $179 at Crate &amp; Barrel, (800) 996-9960 or www.crateandbarrel.com. A nest of three new tables in chocolate-brown leather, designed in the manner of Frank, is $3,315 at Homer, 939 Madison Avenue (74th Street).</p>
        <p>3. A new lamp with a rectangular base in dark brown leather, and a parchment shade, by the English company Ocher, is $680 at Room, 182 Duane Street (Hudson Street); (888) 420-7666. It sits on a licensed reproduction of Frank's design called U, a nest of three sycamore tables made in France by Ecart. The tables are $2,950 at Pucci International, 44 West 18th Street. Background: A three-panel gold-leaf screen with geometric patterns was designed by Frank and executed and signed by Jean Dunand in Paris about 1928. It is $87,500 at DeLorenzo.</p>
        <p>4. A lamp base of hammered steel with a bronze finish comes with a mica shade; $169 at Pottery Barn, (800) 922-5507 or www.potterybarn .com. A low table with an X-shaped base in oak, by Ecart, is also a licensed reproduction of a Frank design; $1,310 at Pucci International.</p>
        <p>5. The Double Square lamp from the Wanders Wonders Collection from Holland is made of white cotton fabric on a metal frame. It is $345 at Mxyplyzyk, 125 Greenwich Avenue (13th Street). The steel console table by Stephen Schermeyer is $310 at Ad Hoc Softwares, 136 Wooster Street (Houston Street). Background: The Ceylon screen, made of split bamboo with a walnut stain, is $329 at Pottery Barn.</p>
        <p>6. Rock crystal lamps are $49.95 and $79.95 at Pearl River Mart, 277 Canal Street (Broadway). Vellum tables by Mattaliano reproduce a Frank design; $2,925 for three at Holly Hunt, 979 Third Avenue (59th Street); to the trade only.</p>
        <p>7. A brass lamp with a bronze finish is in the style of Giacometti, who made many of Frank's lamps. The lamp is 13 inches high and has a fabric shade; $79 at Pottery Barn.</p>
        <p>8. The Vellum Column table lamp, 28 inches high, by Mattaliano is $1,150 at Holly Hunt. The bronze tripod table with a 15-inch-diameter top, by Elizabeth Garouste and Mattia Bonetti, is $1,315 at Homer.</p>
