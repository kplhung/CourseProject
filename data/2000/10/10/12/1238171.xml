        <p>President Clinton is to announce on Thursday that he is lifting many of the trade and economic sanctions against Yugoslavia that were intended to speed the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, immediately ending the ban on American flights and an embargo on oil to the country, senior administration officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton will make a commitment to join with the European Union in sweeping away a variety of additional sanctions over the next several weeks, except for those specifically intended to keep Mr. Milosevic, his family and their political allies from sending millions of dollars in assets overseas.</p>
        <p>But administration officials said they would retain, at least for the time being, the so-called ''outer wall'' of sanctions that prevent Yugoslavia from receiving aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
        <p>That last sanction -- a critical one, because foreign investors are unlikely to return to the country without guarantees from those international institutions -- will remain in place until the United States has discussed Mr. Milosevic's legal fate with the new government of President Vojislav Kostunica. [Page A10.]</p>
        <p>''What we needed to do immediately is open the psychological and the economic spigots, get the oil flowing, get the airplanes in,'' a senior Clinton aide said this evening. Some of the lifting of the sanctions will be more symbolic than substantive -- the embargo on oil was notably toothless. However, the ability to trade with the United States is widely considered a prerequisite for economic recovery.</p>
        <p>The official said that delivering Mr. Milosevic to the international criminal tribunal at The Hague, where he has been indicted on charges of war crimes, may not be a prerequisite for the removal of the rest of the sanctions. He said that the Clinton administration may be satisfied if Mr. Milosevic stands trial in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>''Obviously Milosevic is an issue,'' the official said. ''But it may be an issue that takes care of itself, either because they change their minds, and turn him over, or they try him themselves.''</p>
        <p>So far Mr. Kostunica, who has challenged the legitimacy of the the Hague tribunal as a tool of American policy, has said he would not turn over his predecessor. And even if he decides that removing Mr. Milosevic from the scene will serve his interests, it is far from clear that his tenuous hold on the levers of state power, many of which are still in the hands of Milosevic allies, would give him the power to determine Mr. Milosevic's fate.</p>
        <p>All these questions will be raised, officials say, as the first American diplomats arrive in Belgrade over the next day to begin discussions with Mr. Kostunica's new government, being formed after last week's popular revolution. Two senior officials are already on their way: William Montgomery, the coordinator of the office of Yugoslav affairs, which is based in Budapest, and James C. O'Brien, the special adviser to the president for democracy in the Balkans.</p>
        <p>While the first sanctions will be lifted this week, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces embargoes, is working to track financial flows out of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>Already, officials say, there is evidence that Mr. Milosevic's cronies are using the almost nonexistent controls over banks, resulting from the upheaval of recent weeks, to funnel millions of dollars out of the country.</p>
        <p>One American official said the movement of funds was ''reminiscent of Ferdinand Marcos's last days'' in the Philippines. It took years to track the former Philippine president's holdings, and even then only a fraction were recovered.</p>
        <p>Even before Mr. Kostunica has consolidated his power, there is considerable debate in Washington over the extent to which the economic sanctions contributed to Mr. Milosevic's downfall.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, White House officials believe that they played a significant role. Even aides to Mr. Clinton who have previously expressed great skepticism about the usefulness of economic sanctions -- especially the sanctions on Cuba -- insist that because so many nations worked together in cutting off Yugoslavia's access to goods and financial markets, popular discontent with Mr. Milosevic rose to the surface rapidly.</p>
        <p>''The reason that people finally rose up and said we are going to get rid of this guy is that their lives are hard,'' said one of Mr. Clinton's closest aides. ''This was a case in which sanctions played a big, big role.''</p>
        <p>But Richard N. Haass, a Brookings Institution scholar who served on the National Security Council under President Bush and has published two lengthy studies of sanctions and their effectiveness, disagreed.</p>
        <p>''Sanctions at most played a modest role, and those who are suggesting that they were critical in recent events are simply wrong,'' he said in an interview today. Referring to the peace talks in Ohio that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, he said: ''Sanctions didn't get Milosevic to Dayton; that was the NATO bombing and the Croatian Army. And sanctions couldn't stop the massacres in Kosovo. They had a contributing effect, but not a decisive one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haass agreed with the administration, however, that turning over Mr. Milosevic should not be a prerequisite for breaching the ''outer wall'' of financial aid. ''The goal is to make Yugoslavia a normal European country,'' he said. ''I would not make coughing up Milosevic the No. 1 priority. After all, he was largely killing his own people, and he can be tried in his own country.''</p>
