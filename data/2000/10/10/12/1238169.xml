        <p>European Panel Approves AOL Deal for Time Warner  The European Commission approved Time Warner's $165 billion merger with America Online, but the companies face bigger objections from antitrust regulators in Washington.</p>
        <p>The commission focused its demands almost entirely on preventing the merged company from dominating online music distribution. But regulators played down some of the biggest concerns raised in the United States, like the combined company's potential to dominate online distribution of movies, services like instant messaging and access to high-speed broadband networks.

        <p>European Panel Approves AOL Deal for Time Warner  The European Commission approved Time Warner's $165 billion merger with America Online, but the companies face bigger objections from antitrust regulators in Washington.</p>
        <p>The commission focused its demands almost entirely on preventing the merged company from dominating online music distribution. But regulators played down some of the biggest concerns raised in the United States, like the combined company's potential to dominate online distribution of movies, services like instant messaging and access to high-speed broadband networks.

        <p>F.C.C. May Revamp Building Rules  The Federal Communications Commission is considering issuing new rules that would take a step toward forcing commercial landlords to open their buildings to almost any communications carrier that wants access to their tenants. Landlords of apartment buildings and office towers have had an almost inviolable right to determine which companies may set up shop in their buildings. [A1.]</p>
        <p>G.E. Profit Meets Expectations  General Electric, apparently immune to the weak euro and the softening economy, said that its third-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, meeting analysts' estimates. Investors, accustomed to G.E. meeting or beating expectations, reacted unenthusiastically. Shares of G.E. slipped $1.44, to $56.63. But analysts reiterated their faith in the stock. [C4.]</p>
        <p>More Genetic Corn Said to Be Found  The unapproved genetically engineered corn connected with a nationwide recall of taco shells has been found in a house brand sold by Safeway, a coalition of biotechnology food critics said. Safeway said it would remove the product from its shelves. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Bill Passed on Auto and Tire Defects  Both houses of Congress overwhelmingly approved a bill that would stiffen civil and criminal penalties for failing to report defects in cars and tires. The move is an unusually swift reaction to the failure of industry and regulators to recognize a problem with Firestone tires on Ford Explorers. [C21.]</p>
        <p>Schedule Set in Microsoft Case  The United States Court of Appeals announced a schedule for Microsoft's antitrust appeal that will bring the two sides back into the courtroom at the end of February. The court ordered Microsoft to file its first written brief by Nov. 27, with the government's reply expected Jan. 12. Final briefs are due on Feb. 9, and arguments are set for Feb. 26 and 27.

        <p>U.S. Agents Raid Tax-Cut Company  Federal agents with search warrants raided the headquarters of the Tax People, which has been selling aggressive tax-avoidance techniques to middle-class Americans. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Gemstar Plans Push Into E-Books  The chairman of Gemstar-TV Guide International will outline today the details of his bid to make his company's technology the dominant format for electronic publishing by becoming the central distributor, bookstore and bookshelf for anyone who reads electronic books. But the scale of his ambitions has already stirred some anxieties about its potential power in the fledgling market. [C12.]</p>
        <p>China Oil Concern Prepares Offering  As the Chinese government prepares to set a price for the initial public offering in the country's second-largest oil company, Sinopec, the company has been jolted by an 11th-hour disclosure that one of its subsidiaries has invested in Sudan. [World Business, Section W.]</p>
        <p>Theory and Practice in Drug Plans  Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush both agree that elderly citizens should have government-subsidized prescription drug insurance. But both of their proposals deviate from the ideal model of economic insurance, which would seem to prescribe catastrophic coverage with a deductible and co-payment. Alan B. Krueger: Economic Scene.
