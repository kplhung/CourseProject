        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am a fifth-grade student in Dutchess County, New York. Regarding your Oct. 10 front-page article about the school board that limited homework in Piscataway, N.J., I think that having regular homework until 10:45 p.m. and then having to practice an instrument is terrible. But I also think that the school board went a little too far when it prohibited teachers from grading homework. What is the point of homework if it isn't corrected?</p>

        <p>At my public school in Red Hook, the homework policy is: third grade, 30 minutes; fourth grade, 40 minutes; fifth grade, 50 minutes; and so on. That is a better policy because it is just enough to reinforce the concepts learned in school, but not so much that it makes us have to choose between getting a good night's sleep and practicing our instruments, in my case the trumpet.</p>
