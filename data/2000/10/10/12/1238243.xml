        <p>Mets notebook; Matt Franco is added to roster of New York Mets for NLCS to replace injured Derek Bell; pitcher Pat Mahomes is left off roster (S)</p>

        <p>Perhaps if the Mets were playing the Atlanta Braves and their left-handed closer, John Rocker, Matt Franco would still be a spectator for the National League Championship Series.

        <p>Perhaps if the Mets were playing the Atlanta Braves and their left-handed closer, John Rocker, Matt Franco would still be a spectator for the National League Championship Series. But the Mets are playing the St. Louis Cardinals, who have only one left-hander in their bullpen, so Franco is a good fit.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine picked Matt Franco, a left-handed infielder, to take the place of the injured outfielder Derek Bell. Pat Mahomes, the long reliever who spent the entire regular season with the club, was left off the roster for the second playoff round in a row.</p>
        <p>''I was pretty much sure I was going to be on it, but the talk turned to 11 pitchers the last couple of days, and I was a little concerned,'' Franco said. ''But things worked out for me and I'm real excited about it.''</p>
        <p>The Mets are carrying 10 pitchers after having 11 in the regular season and in last October's playoffs. But Valentine said he was not concerned about overworking his staff; there are two off-days built into this series, and with Glendon Rusch in the bullpen, the Mets have six relievers, just as they did in the regular season.</p>
        <p>Valentine said he felt the Mets' only vulnerability was exposed in the first round against the Giants, when he had to shift Robin Ventura to first base in a double switch in Game 3. Franco can play third and first, and he joins Darryl Hamilton and Lenny Harris as left-handers on the bench.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals' only left-handed reliever is Jason Christiansen. Even if he is called in and the Mets have to pinch-hit for a left-handed pinch-hitter, they will have two more left-handed bats remaining.</p>
        <p>''You'd still like to have two if you burn one early,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Ankiel a Familiar Face</p>
        <p>The Mets were aware of Rick Ankiel, the Cardinals' Game 2 starter, before he pitched seven strong innings against them last month. Ankiel attended Port St. Lucie High School in the same Florida town where the Mets hold spring training. He was friends with the son of a Mets minor league coach and sometimes dropped by the Mets' complex to work with their instructors and throw off the mounds.</p>
        <p>''He was very polished,'' said Jim Duquette, the Mets' assistant general manager and farm director.</p>
        <p>Ankiel could have pitched for the Mets, but they passed on him in the first round of the 1997 draft, fearing a protracted negotiation with the agent Scott Boras. The Cardinals picked Ankiel in the second round, paid him a $2.5 million bonus and watched him develop into the National League's top rookie pitcher this year. Ankiel said he has never liked the Mets, for reasons he would not explain.</p>
        <p>Tickets Gone</p>
        <p>The Mets sold out all three potential National League Championship Series games at Shea Stadium by 11 a.m. today, the team announced.</p>
