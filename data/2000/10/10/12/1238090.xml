        <p>WENDY EWALD, 49, a photographer and video artist with the graying, dirty-blond bob and milk-plastic sunglasses of a 1940's movie star, was sitting at a weathered table in a shady corner of the garden behind her cottage in Red Hook, N.Y. She lives there with her husband, Tom McDonough, a writer and cinematographer, and their son, Michael, 4, whom they adopted in Colombia.</p>
        <p>''People's conceptions of children are very far from who children actually are,'' Ms. Ewald said. ''Because they don't speak for themselves, there are so many stereotypes.''</p>
        <p>For 30 years, she has been creating a portrait of childhood, in pictures and words, which she has asked children to help her construct. In a sense, it is the children's body of work, and Ms. Ewald has been only their collaborator.</p>
        <p>In Canada, Kentucky, Colombia, India, Mexico, South Africa, Morocco, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and now Durham, N.C., Ms. Ewald has taught children, ages 10 to 13, to use cameras to make photographs of their families, homes and communities, as well as representations of their dreams and fantasies. They write or record stories, too, to accompany their pictures. What she has produced with her students is a different kind of children's story -- an illustrated tale that adults would never suspect and would never have told. She also makes her own photographs of them and their communities, as an artist. Ms. Ewald has exhibited or published several of these regional projects of photographs, with their narratives, over the years.</p>
        <p>Now, a retrospective of this work, ''Wendy Ewald: Secret Games, Collaborations With Children, 1969-1999,'' is traveling in Europe and will come to the United States next year. The catalog, which includes photographs and text by both Ms. Ewald and children from each country she has worked in, has just been published here by Scalo.</p>
        <p>Seen from its four corners, the world of childhood is its own global village, with its own fables and laws.  The images are of family and home, shot from within, seized through eyes that see like windows without glass. Ms Ewald discovered quickly that a child's sense of place is fierce, not frightened or unformed.</p>
        <p>In a village in India, a girl named Samju, 12, from the farmer caste, refused to depict her dreams.</p>
        <p>''We have only bad dreams -- no happy ones,'' she told Ms. Ewald. ''I want to die, so I don't have to get married. Girls have troubles after they marry.'' Samju was later killed in a fire that a fellow student, writing Ms. Ewald this year, described as a bride burning.</p>
        <p>In rural Kentucky, a boy named Johnny, 12, recalled, in a taped interview, his life before his father was sent to prison.</p>
        <p>''I had the best family in the world until then,'' he told Ms. Ewald. He taught his younger brother Charles, 10, to swim by tying plastic milk jugs under his arms. Mountain panthers raided the hog pen one night.</p>
        <p>''After we moved I never saw panthers no more,'' Johnny said. He saw his father once, from a distance, after his parole. Johnny said of his future: ''Life would be happy for me if Daddy would ever come back to us. When I get older, if anybody's trying to break my family up, I'll kill them. I know I will.''</p>
        <p>On a blue September morning, Ms. Ewald arrived late for an interview. The modest cottage and garden seemed enchanted, like a town in a children's story when the inhabitants have disappeared. Inside an unoccupied room was a train set with toy mountains. In the empty garden was a rusting wheelbarrow and a sailboat sundial.</p>
        <p>''Whoops,'' Ms. Ewald said, stepping from her car and walking to the house. ''I had to buy presents for three 5-year-olds.'' She came out through the back door with lemonade, and sat, a breeze in a tree swaying the sky above her head.</p>
        <p>In Canada, on the Naskapi reservation, she took her own tentative pictures of Indian life. For their part, the children took pictures of what they knew: alcoholism, joblessness, inadequate housing, the scarcity of food and a people between two cultures -- a photograph of the chief, drunk, trying to saw a board.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ewald typically works with a dozen students, teaching them technical proficiency. What the children produce is a view without filters -- like cyanotypes lighted by the glow of the heart.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ewald recalled sixth grade students in North Carolina presenting their photographs in class. A boy recounted losing his house, and his brother, in a fire.</p>
        <p>''At the end, he said, 'I was playing with matches, and lit the match,' '' she said. ''There were gasps from the other kids.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ewald admires her students' work as photographers -- she included several of their pictures in the portfolio she submitted to the Whitney Museum of American Art for its 1997 Biennial.</p>
        <p>''Their dedication to making the pictures is just extraordinary,'' she said. ''It gives them power -- to decide who's in the picture and who's not, and how they're shown. Kids rarely have that much power, and they're aware of that.''</p>
        <p>In many instances, Ms. Ewald's assignments were not easy to complete. In South Africa, where she lived in 1992, the black children's cameras were confiscated by the police, who assumed that the expensive equipment was stolen.</p>
        <p>''The police told me that the kids had to carry notes saying that they had the right to use these cameras, so we had a meeting to decide,'' she said. ''The kids voted not to do it. They said they had a right to carry the cameras.''</p>
        <p>White South African children, asked to photograph what they didn't like about their communities, took pictures of black people. Black children photographed the interiors of their houses, because they felt unsafe on the street, Ms. Ewald said. She observed the same thing in Durham.</p>
        <p>''In Soweto, they were afraid to put the camera up to their face, because then they would lose their peripheral vision,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>At an exhibition of the South African children's work, though, Ms. Ewald watched two boys, black and white, befriend each other out of mutual respect for their pictures.</p>
        <p>In the tar-paper huts of Barrio Luis Alberto Vega, a squatters' settlement in Bogota, Colombia, she said, women kept a kettle on the boil. The scalding water would be used to throw at the police, who periodically stormed the camp, bayoneting the tar-paper walls. Everywhere around the world, home was of prime importance, her students taught Ms. Ewald.</p>
        <p>''There was a sense of preserving what was old in the culture,'' she said of their photographs. ''In Kentucky, it was the greater home of the mountains, and traditions that they had, like the boys going raccoon hunting, or making molasses, killing a hog -- the day-to-day of self-survival. And they were very proud of those things.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ewald is now a senior research associate at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University in Durham. She helped to create the Literacy Through Photography program, a project for students and teachers in local public schools based on her work with children internationally.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ewald says she has come to believe that the artistic and journalistic act of making a photograph has a true educational value and relevance.</p>
        <p>''Making the photographs brings the students' home lives into the classroom,'' she said. ''It allows the kids to share with each other. In this country, the mix of students is getting more and more diverse. A lot of times, a Latino kid will have no idea how an African-American kid lives, or a Korean kid.'' It is an intimate concern of Ms. Ewald's now because of her son, Michael. ''He's not white,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ewald hopes that living on a rural street upstate will provide Michael with a sense of a diverse community on a personal scale that he can expand as he grows older.</p>
        <p>''It's important that he feel that friends are neighbors, living up and down the road, that he can go and see,'' she said.</p>
        <p>What Ms. Ewald saw everywhere in the world were people visiting each other. ''People getting together and talking, on their porches or on a string bed in front of the house, or the women in Morocco, calling out their doors,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''And hospitality -- inviting you in for a cup of water, or an ice cream sandwich,'' she added. ''I think that's pretty universal.''</p>
        <p>She smiled at the thought, as though it were a picture that had come out unexpectedly well.</p>
