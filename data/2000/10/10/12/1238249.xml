        <p>ENCOUNTERED by a New Yorker in the lobby of a local hotel, a Cardinals fan was asked if it was true or just hype that people around here don't like New York, and the Mets. ''It's genuine,'' the man said. ''New Yorkers can be very antagonistic. When you meet New Yorkers, you get the impression that they don't think there's any place but New York.''</p>
        <p>''Is there?'' the New Yorker asked.</p>
        <p>''See what I mean!'' the man said.</p>
        <p>Then the man, Bob Gibson, of Baseball Hall of Fame fame and who still serves as a special instructor to the Cardinals, smiled -- that little wicked smile so familiar when he was intimidating big league batters.</p>
        <p>''What's bothered some people around here recently,'' he said, ''is the remarks by some Mets players that they're glad to be playing the Cardinals instead of the Braves in the championship series. Sure, the Cardinals' pitching staff isn't as strong as the Braves', but remember, we just finished beating the Braves in three straight games in the division series.</p>
        <p>''And to top it off, I was talking on the phone with a friend in New York, and he said, 'It would be great for baseball if the Yankees and Mets play in a subway World Series.' It would be great for New York, if it's a Subway Series. But not for baseball. The two best teams playing would be great for baseball.''</p>
        <p>Before it gets to that next step, the Cardinals and the Mets -- as well as the Mariners and the Yankees -- must settle their affairs. The particular feeling evinced by St. Louis folks toward Gothamites, particularly in the baseball area, reached a boiling point in the mid- and late-1980's, when, in the days before the wild card, the Mets and the Cardinals battled each other bitterly for the National League East title.</p>
        <p>The way it was then is the way it is now, as the Mets opened their series at Busch Stadium last night with a 6-2 victory and took the first step toward becoming the N.L.'s representative in the World Series. In the stands, it seemed as though someone had spilled red dye in the washing machines of the capacity crowd of 52,255. Cardinal red was suffused on virtually every blouse and cap and kerchief in sight. And whether it was the color or the competition, their enthusiasms were palpably incited.</p>
        <p>But the Mets quickly threw sand in their soup, scoring two runs in the first inning. They added another in the fifth and three more for good measure in the ninth, on home runs by Todd Zeile and Jay Payton. The ballpark during these outbursts was as quiet as a catacomb. The Cards, meanwhile, were toothless, as well as runless, until they scored two unearned runs with two outs in the ninth. It gave the home fans only these few scraps to cheer about -- the boosting at this point seemed almost sympathetic -- as the Mets took a 1-0 lead in the series.</p>
        <p>But things had a decidedly different feel earlier.</p>
        <p>''When I walked into the park yesterday,'' said Ron Darling, a key pitcher for the Mets in the 1980's and now a television sportscaster, ''I got goose bumps. We had so many big games here.'' He recalled that last series between the teams in 1985, when the up-and-coming Mets played in St. Louis in the final week, trailing the first-place Cardinals by three games. The first game was famously won, 1-0, in the 11th inning, when Darryl Strawberry hit a home run so prodigious it seemed like a special-effects gimmick from  ''Star Wars.''</p>
        <p>Darling started that game and went nine innings, giving up just four hits. The Mets won the next day, too, behind Dwight Gooden, but lost the last game, 4-3. The Cardinals won the division, and then the pennant, and the rivalry was in full swing.</p>
        <p>Those Cardinals said they weren't getting respect from New York. The Cardinals' manager at the time, Whitey Herzog, who unaccountably relished the nickname the White Rat, said there was a national bias toward the Mets. ''Whatever they do gets headlines,'' he said. ''When we do something, it's in the corner of a paper.''</p>
        <p>Taking his lead, the Cardinals of the 80's became one of the most bilious ball clubs in memory. Their ace pitcher, John Tudor, for one, gave the impression he simply didn't like people, or was it just sportswriters? ''All you need to get a press credential for the World Series,'' he said, ''is to show a driver's license.'' (Was he actually onto something?)</p>
        <p>The next year, 1986, the Mets swept the Cardinals in a four-game series in St. Louis early in the season and went on to win the division, the pennant and the World Series. Two of their stars were the Wunderkinder Strawberry and Gooden. The world was their special oyster. The sky the limit. Whatever became of those two guys anyway?</p>
        <p>''Nobody's talked about us all year,'' Eric Davis, the Cardinals' right fielder, said yesterday, repeating old, familiar lyrics. ''Nobody gave us a chance to be here.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the fans here were cheering their red Lovebirds on. And dissing the guys from the Big City. ''Pond scum,'' is what a local disc jockey, J. C. Corcoran, generously refers to as the Metsies, a term that originated in 1985 and has been happily revived by the local fandom. Corcoran recalled his first trip to Shea Stadium, ''It looked like everyone in the crowd had been paroled that afternoon.'' A New Yorker, in response, might wonder if the man was off his Rocker.</p>
        <p>Jose Oquendo, who played for the Mets and the Cardinals in the 1980's and 1990's, and who is now a Cardinals coach, said: ''What rivalry? It's just two good teams playing as hard as they know how, trying get to the next level. There's no rivalry. Never been.''</p>
        <p>There seemed a bit of a pallor to Oquendo, as though the fellow had been living in a cave for some time.</p>
