        <p>He talked about tax relief, about the need to ''trust people before government,'' about the energy he sees in supporters at his campaign stops.</p>
        <p>But Representative Rick A. Lazio, in a 10-minute address to 1,200 state Republicans at a Manhattan hotel last night, made no mention of the reason the crowd had gathered: soft money, or more specifically, the need to raise it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, has disparaged such unregulated, unlimited contributions to political parties as a corrupting influence on politics.</p>
        <p>He has campaigned with Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican most closely identified with the issue, and has said that his campaign has not raised any soft money for itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have agreed to ban the use of soft money for advertising in their race and have asked independent groups not to broadcast ads on their behalf or against their opponent.</p>
        <p>But last night, as the Republican Party collected $2.5 million at the New York Victory 2000 dinner, with some contributors paying up to $100,000, nary a word was spoken on the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio did not speak to reporters at the event, which was also attended by Gov. George E. Pataki and William Powers, the chairman of the state Republican committee.Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has also pressed for campaign finance reform, skipped the event to attend the Yankees-Mariners playoff game at Yankee Stadium, Mr. Powers told the crowd, adding, ''He sends his best but felt he had to coach up there tonight.''</p>
        <p>Democrats said Mr. Lazio showed hypocrisy by attending, but Mr. Lazio has said that there was no conflict in speaking at the fund-raiser because the party said it intended to use the money for voter drives and not commercials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio used the occasion to try to rally the party faithful, some of whom have complained that Mr. Lazio has not campaigned hard enough. Mr. Lazio delivered a variation of his standard stump speech, with a little more gusto and a few lines meant to drive up interest in the campaign.</p>
        <p>''Will you work hard for me?'' he asked to rising cheers. ''This is a team effort,'' he said. ''This is about all of us, a team going forth for the next 28 days. You as my ambassadors, as people who will bring energy and commitment. And you as my truth squad.''</p>
        <p>''So I promise you this,'' Mr. Lazio said, ''I am going to work very, very hard in the next 28 days. We're going to carry our message of opportunity, of true opportunity, of progress, of timeless values, of the relevance of character and integrity of trust in public service.''</p>
