        <p>Congress is rushing to provide additional money to health maintenance organizations to keep them in the Medicare program, even as politicians daily denounce the abuses of H.M.O.'s on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said today that the increase in payments to managed care plans was excessive.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Mr. Clinton said, ''The Congressional Republican leadership is preparing to pass unjustifiably large Medicare H.M.O. payment increases while preventing passage of a strong patients' bill of rights.''</p>
        <p>Clinton administration officials said they doubted that the increased payments would induce any health maintenance organizations to enter or rejoin the Medicare program. Thus, they said, the payments are a waste of money.</p>
        <p>Furious battles broke out today on Capitol Hill among health care lobbyists vying for a limited amount of new Medicare money. With little hope of enlarging the pie, each sector of the health care industry sought a bigger slice for itself.</p>
        <p>Republican negotiators from the House and the Senate neared agreement on a package that would increase Medicare spending by $26 billion to $28 billion over the next five years. About one-third of that increase would go to H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>Medicare spent roughly $214 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Health maintenance organizations received $40 billion of that.</p>
        <p>The legislation would increase payments to health care providers while adding coverage of some preventive health services for the elderly or disabled. Democratic members of Congress and White House officials said they had been excluded from negotiations on the bill.</p>
        <p>Hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies complained that they were being shortchanged while H.M.O.'s got more than their fair share of the available money.</p>
        <p>H.M.O.'s serve 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries -- 6.2 million of the 39 million people in the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert defended Republican efforts to increase payments to H.M.O.'s, especially those in rural areas. Payments vary by county, and in many rural areas, the payments are so low that no H.M.O. is available to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>The White House contends that H.M.O.'s are already overpaid. Numerous government studies say Medicare typically pays more for an individual in an H.M.O. than it would pay for the same person in the traditional fee-for-service program.</p>
        <p>But members of Congress said they had decided to pump large sums of money into H.M.O.'s because they and their elderly constituents were alarmed at the possible demise of Medicare's managed care program.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, 734,000 Medicare beneficiaries suffered disruption of their health insurance as H.M.O.'s withdrew from their areas. Another 933,000 people will be dropped in January.</p>
        <p>H.M.O.'s have mobilized beneficiaries to lobby for an increase in Medicare payments to health plans, which frequently offer drug coverage and other benefits not available in the traditional Medicare program.</p>
        <p>Michael A. Stocker, president of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New York, sent letters to all 43,000 people in its Medicare H.M.O. urging them to lobby Congress. More than 60 percent of these beneficiaries sent postcards to Congress, asking lawmakers to ''preserve my health care options'' by increasing payments.</p>
        <p>Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, said it was unfortunate that Congress could not meet the financial needs of all health care providers. But she defended her efforts to obtain a large share of the money.</p>
        <p>''Medicare managed care is a program in crisis,'' Ms. Ignagni said. ''It needs to be rescued.''</p>
        <p>But Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said, ''Congress is channeling money from hospitals on Main Street to investor-owned H.M.O.'s on Wall Street, enhancing the profits of managed care companies without improving the delivery of services.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 13, 2000, Friday  A picture caption yesterday about Congressional consideration of H.M.O. payments misidentified the House member seated between Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and Representative Michael Bilirakis. It was Bill Thomas, not Bill Archer.</p>
