        <p>BACK in the late 1960's, when Kenneth Jay Lane, the jewelry designer, saw the narrow green town house in Murray Hill, he bought it for the same reason many of his neighbors had bought theirs: it was in an area close to Midtown where doctors, lawyers and advertising executives were not only living, but working.</p>
        <p>When he first spotted it, Mr. Lane knew he loved the ''bones'' of the house, which was built in the 1870's for the Underwoods of typewriter fame. But he found its decor ''a bit dreary,'' he said last week. There were small-pane Tudor-style windows overlooking the rear garden and lots of conventional fittings.</p>
        <p>That was soon to change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane remembers that he spent a year -- and about $500,000 in 1968 dollars, the equivalent of roughly $2.5 million now -- ripping everything out and putting in his own distinctive touches. The house, at 115 East 38th Street, became a paean to the late 60's, an extremely tasteful version of the Austin Powers era, and it was featured in magazines, with its garden trelliswork, oeil-de-boeuf window, blue and white Delft-tiled kitchen, dining room totally covered in dark printed fabric and totally, totally mirrored master bathroom.</p>
        <p>He installed a superb handmade wrought-iron handrail on the staircase, done by a maker of garden furniture in Connecticut, whose name he cannot now remember. (An unfortunate lapse, as shall become apparent.) ''I used to walk up and down that staircase, and if I felt a bump I'd mark it with chalk, and he'd have to come back and sand it,'' the designer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane sold the house in 1977 to Liza Minnelli, who owned it for only a year and never moved in, Mr. Lane said. (''I told Liza she was not a house person,'' he said. ''She needs an apartment.'')</p>
        <p>This August, the 6,000-square-foot house was sold again, for $2.85 million, to Liora Manne, a carpet designer who, in the early 90's, developed a process called Lamontage, which uses synthetic fiber felting to create mosaic effects on rugs, place mats, plates and skirts. Ms. Manne has moved in with Charles Peck, a carpet importer. (Guess how they met!) Together, they have four children: two from his previous marriage, and two from hers. Two of the children live there full time, and two arrive on the weekends.</p>
        <p>Real estate brokers say that the Manne-Peck menage is part of a new wave of families moving into Murray Hill, the historic neighborhood nestled just below Grand Central Terminal. ''As prices for town houses skyrocketed on the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side, Murray Hill, Kips Bay and even the upper 20's started to look better and better to families,'' said Kathleen Burns Hoffman, head of town house sales for William B. May Real Estate. ''Over the last four years, prices have really jumped there, too.'' But a house like Ms. Manne's in, say, the 70's between Park and Lexington Avenues might cost $5 million to $7 million, she added.</p>
        <p>And just like some of the other families moving into town houses that had been split between personal and professional space, the couple are trying to decide how to make the house work for them, including trying to figure out what to keep and what to wave goodbye to. And because so much of Mr. Lane's decor is still there, they are having some particularly difficult choices, they said.</p>
        <p>At least for now, they will leave Mr. Lane's rock crystal doorknobs from P. E. Guerin. They will keep the mirrored master bath, as well as the mirrored powder room that's tucked under the stairs on the first floor. They love the sweeping wrought-iron staircase so much they want to extend it up through the entire house -- hence the problem with Mr. Lane's memory. (He promises to try to find the craftsman's name.) And they adore the Delft-tiled kitchen; in fact, they bought new blue pottery dishes to match.</p>
        <p>But after a lot of hand-wringing, they have decided to part with the tented ceiling and fabric-covered dining room walls. (''Goodbye to my tent?'' Mr. Lane asked, incredulous.)</p>
        <p>Alas, yes. ''It is so lovely,'' Ms. Manne said, ''but in the end, a little dark for us. We love light -- we need light.''</p>
        <p>To get more light into the ground floor, the couple, working with the architectural firm of Peix &amp; Marchetti, are lopping off a five-foot section that had been added at some point to the back of the house and creating a double-height conservatory off the dining room. They will then build a balcony leading off the upstairs drawing room, which, at this moment, contains a few pieces of furniture and a white scale model of the renovation.</p>
        <p>The couple, who moved into the house a few weeks ago from the carriage house they had been renting a few blocks away, said they were delighted to have found a place in the same neighborhood. ''We almost bought a house in Westchester,'' Ms. Manne said. ''Thank goodness we found this house in time!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peck agreed. ''Where else,'' he asked, ''could you get views of the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, from not only the roof deck but from most of the rooms? And where else could you get a parking spot in front of your house -- maybe not every night, but at least the other night, when I was unloading all the new dishes?''</p>
