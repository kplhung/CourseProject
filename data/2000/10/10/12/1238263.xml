        <p>St Louis Cardinals outfielder Jim Edmonds, whose fine season with team has included several clutch home runs, discusses just missing hitting home run that would have tied score against New York Mets in 7th inning of game 1 of NLCS (M)</p>

        <p>Jim Edmonds does not have a long history in Busch Stadium but he is familiar enough with the place to know when he has hit a home run. So when Edmonds drove the first pitch he saw from Mike Hampton in the seventh inning tonight, Edmonds was sure he had tied the score.</p>
        <p>But Edmonds's drive to left field landed in Benny Agbayani's glove at the wall, ending the inning and preserving Hampton's shutout. That was Hampton's final pitch and the Cardinals' last gasp. St. Louis lost, 6-2, to the Mets in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series tonight.</p>
        <p>Clutch homers have become almost routine for Edmonds, a top candidate for the league's Most Valuable Player award. He hit 42 homers this season after the Cardinals acquired him from the Anaheim Angels in spring training. Edmonds batted .571 with two homers and seven runs batted in during the Cardinals' three-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves in their division series.</p>
        <p>Edmonds was 2 for 5 tonight but left five runners on base as the Cardinals were 0 for 13 with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>''We have to take advantage of these opportunities just to beat this team,'' Edmonds said.</p>
        <p>When Edmonds batted in the seventh inning, the Mets were ahead, 3-0. Hampton's pitch count was high and the Mets' vaunted bullpen waited. If the Cardinals were going to rally, this was the time. A leadoff single by Placido Polanco and a one-out walk to Fernando Vina put the tying run at the plate.</p>
        <p>Edgar Renteria flied out to the right-field warning track for the second out. With Hampton tiring, Edmonds came up hoping to tie it. He drove Hampton's first pitch -- his 112th of the game -- to left field, where Agbayani back-pedaled to the wall. The crosswinds moved the ball, and Agbayani raised his glove at the last moment to catch the ball as he leaned against the wall.</p>
        <p>''I've had that ball a few times and it's been a home run, but you got to realize it was a damp and cool night,'' Edmonds said. ''No disrespect to Mike Hampton, but I thought I had a shot. That's the way it goes.''</p>
        <p>Agbayani also thought the ball was gone initially, as did most of Edmonds's teammates.</p>
        <p>''When he first hit it, I didn't think it was going out,'' Hampton said. ''I thought it was in. The way Benny approached it, I thought, 'No, no.' ''</p>
        <p>Edmonds's and Hampton's seasons have been intertwined since last winter. The Mets were interested in acquiring Edmonds after John Olerud signed with Seattle as a free agent. Mets General Manager Steve Phillips saw Edmonds as one player who might be available because of his pending free agency and had serious discussion with Angels General Manager Bill Stoneman in December.</p>
        <p>But Phillips was startled when Stoneman asked for Roger Cedeno and the starting pitchers Octavio Dotel and Grant Roberts. They were Mets with some of the highest trade value.</p>
        <p>''It really wasn't a deal where we were going to give up the pitching unless we got a pitcher back,'' Phillips said recently. ''We knew we were distant. From that point on, they never considered us an option.''</p>
        <p>Through a team spokesman today, Stoneman said he would not discuss conversations with the Mets about Edmonds.</p>
        <p>Phillips traded Dotel and Cedeno to the Astros on Dec. 23 for Hampton and Derek Bell, filling his need for an ace starter while adding a run-producing outfielder. But Phillips did not  let up. He knew Edmonds would probably be moved before the season started, so he continued to call Stoneman through spring training, even with his trading options limited.</p>
        <p>Stoneman did not call Phillips back. He took Edmonds off the market in the final week of spring training, tired of the circus that had developed and frustrated that the Yankees would not meet his asking price.</p>
        <p>Then, on March 23, the night before the Mets flew to Japan to open the season against the Chicago Cubs, Stoneman traded Edmonds to the Cardinals for pitcher Kent Bottenfield and the minor league infielder Adam Kennedy. After the Mets landed in Tokyo, Phillips told reporters he was surprised by the trade because the Angels never returned Phillips's calls asking for a new trade proposal.</p>
        <p>''It was surprising that two days later they had changed their minds,''  Phillips said this week.</p>
        <p>Seven months later, Edmonds and Hampton's paths crossed again, at the left-field wall.</p>
