        <p>Martha Stewart introduces tableware that closely resembles Drabware, stark khaki Wedgwood pattern that was discontinued a few years ago; photo (Currents column) (S)</p>

        <p>Now there is no reason to cry over broken Drabware. The stark khaki Wedgwood pattern was inexplicably discontinued a few years ago, and was nearly impossible to replace. But Martha Stewart, who uses Drabware in her own home, has introduced tableware, above, that is a dead ringer for the original, in a color she calls ''scone'' and at a fraction of the price. A set of four dinner plates is $12.99, four salad plates are $9.99. A mug, coffee cup or cereal bowl is $2.49, the water pitcher is $12.99 and the salt and pepper set is $4.99. Also in eight other colors. At Kmart, (800) 866-0086, or through www.bluelight.com.</p>
