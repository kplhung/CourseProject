        <p>From the 15th century through the 17th century, scholars often used the human hand as a symbol and a tool for explaining the mind, anatomy, religion and science. ''Writing on Hands: Memory and Knowledge in Early Modern Europe,'' an exhibition at the Trout Gallery at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., through Nov. 25, offers several illustrations at www.writingonhands.org. The Web site images, some with animation or sound, depict hands used to show astrological signs, to teach a sign language for counting large numbers and to teach music theory.  The exhibition will be at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington from Dec. 13 to March 4.</p>
