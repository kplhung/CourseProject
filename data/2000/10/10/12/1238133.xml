        <p>Advanced Micro Devices reported quarterly earnings today that exceeded analysts' expectations, an announcement that comes as its chief competitors have warned that their own quarterly results will not meet projections.</p>
        <p>Advanced Micro reported third-quarter earnings of $219.3 million, or 64 cents a diluted share, 2 cents more than analysts expected. The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., had a loss of $99 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales for the quarter ended Oct. 1 were $1.21 billion, up from $1.17 billion the previous quarter and $662 million in the 1999 period.</p>
        <p>Intel, Advanced Micro's biggest rival, experienced sharp declines in its stock price last month after warning that third-quarter revenue would miss analysts' expectations. Citing weak European sales, Intel said revenue would be 3 to 5 percent higher than that of the second quarter, compared with the 9 to 12 percent expected by Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Motorola, another competitor, reported third-quarter sales yesterday that were lower than expected, and today cut its profit outlook for the fourth quarter and the coming year.</p>
        <p>Advanced Micro officials said European sales were strong. ''We must have gained market share,'' W. J. Sanders III, the chief executive, said.  Advanced Micro's shares rose 75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $23.50, in trading.</p>
