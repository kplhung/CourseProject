        <p>France Telecom confirmed that it was talking with Equant, which operates one of the largest data communication networks, about ''a possible transaction.'' But the French company said it did not expect a deal under the current market conditions. Over the last year, Equant has discussed mergers with many partners, including Global Crossing and Infonet. This is the second time it has held talks with France Telecom. Disagreements over the value of the 34 percent of Equant owned by SITA, a consortium of major airlines, as well as SITA's demand for cash, have proved obstacles to any deal, people close to the discussions said.</p>
