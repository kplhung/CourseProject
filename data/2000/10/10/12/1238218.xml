        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The photographs accompanying the article about the technological riches enjoyed at an elementary school in Suffern, N.Y., were distressing to those of us who care about gender equity in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Did anyone look carefully at these pictures? Of the 18 children who could be easily identified working at computers, two, or at most three, were girls. These photographs illustrating the potential of technology for young children speak volumes about the progress that still needs to be made to insure equal opportunities for girls and boys.</p>
        <p>Either girls do not have the same access as boys -- which I hope is not the case -- or, somewhat surprisingly, the disparity in this particular set of pictures went unnoticed. While I am very interested in the possibilities of technology for young children, I am just as concerned with the potential message: ''Girls need not apply.''</p>
        <p>SARA ALDER  New York</p>
        <p>The writer is head of the Lower School at the Chapin School.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 14, 2000, Saturday  A letter to the editor in Circuits on Thursday about computers in schools misspelled the writer's surname. She is Sara Adler, not Alder.</p>
