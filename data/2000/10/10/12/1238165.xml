        <p>The New England Patriots began the season one play away from victory -- the final play of the game against Tampa Bay -- but a pass by Drew Bledsoe landed out of the end zone and the Patriots lost, 21-16. The next week the Patriots jumped to a 19-7 lead against the Jets but allowed 13 consecutive points in the final 10 minutes of the game and lost, 20-19.</p>
        <p>Similar trends occurred in the Patriots' 21-13 loss to Minnesota and their 10-3 loss to Miami.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the Patriots were an 0-4 team, and there were plenty of indications that more misery lay ahead.</p>
        <p>Bledsoe was being sacked mercilessly. A Patriots offensive line that could not protect Bledsoe also failed to open running lanes. The defense, playing with little margin for error, suffered. The Patriots were a mess.</p>
        <p>''At 0-4 we had to look around the locker room and understand one thing: nobody was going to feel sorry for us or give us anything,'' cornerback Ty Law said. ''Personally, I thought we had begun to make too many excuses for ourselves.</p>
        <p>''If there is a ball to be caught, catch it. If the pass protection isn't so great, work with what you've got. If the defense has to make the plays at the end to win, do it. We began to not only think that way, but also act and play that way.''</p>
        <p>The results were stunning.</p>
        <p>New England won at Denver, 28-19, after 11 consecutive losses there. New England rolled over a hot Indianapolis team, 24-16, last Sunday to give the Patriots a 2-4 record.</p>
        <p>Now comes the rematch with the Jets on Sunday, this time at Foxboro Stadium. The Patriots are a team halfway out of a bleak hole. Beat the Jets, reach a 3-4 record, and the Patriots are one victory away from pulling to an even record with exactly half of their regular season left.</p>
        <p>A small miracle.</p>
        <p>There was little reason to think New England could win at Denver since the Patriots had not won there since 1968. Their chances looked slim against Indianapolis since the Colts had just won at Buffalo and looked ready to sprint toward a fast divisional and conference start.</p>
        <p>But the Patriots in their last two games not only regrouped but also re-examined their offense. That is where surgery was required.</p>
        <p>''Obviously there were things we could do better all the way around,'' Bill Belichick, the Patriots' coach, said. ''But one of the main things was to figure out the things we can do on offense, figure out what weapons we have and maximize that.''</p>
        <p>That tune has a familiar ring.</p>
        <p>Often in the National Football League, when things go wrong with a team, it is with the offense. Thus far this season, only St. Louis and Minnesota have been exempt. Both teams are unbeaten.</p>
        <p>Buffalo can't score enough. Atlanta can't block. Jacksonville's offense is spinning out of control. Seattle made a quarterback change that failed last week. Tampa Bay's offense looks confused. Even Baltimore, which owns a sparkling 5-1 record, has offensive troubles. The Giants need more offense. The Jets wonder which direction and which quarterback their offense will take.</p>
        <p>But the Patriots in their last two games found offensive answers.</p>
        <p>Bledsoe began scrambling more to keep drives alive. The Patriots asked him to roll right and left to buy more pass-protection time. The offensive line began to mesh. On both sides of the ball, New England in practices began diverting more attention to its red zone and third-down play.</p>
        <p>The result? Victories. Improvement. Especially in the red zone.</p>
        <p>Consider that against the Jets, the Patriots scored a touchdown, kicked four field goals and missed a field goal in six trips to the red zone. In their victories over Denver and Indianapolis, however, the Patriots scored five touchdowns and one field goal in six trips to the red zone.</p>
        <p>The Jets give the Patriots a marquee game to continue their new trend. The rivalry remains intense and so does New England's desire to avenge its collapse during that first matchup in Week 2.</p>
        <p>''Both teams are highly competitive and it's a divisional game and an important game,'' Belichick said.</p>
        <p>These are the games that true competitors love, and the Patriots are showing that they do enjoy competing. They believe their first Jets game was a fluke of sorts and want to show that this time they can, indeed, finish what they start.</p>
        <p>The way the Patriots' season has unfolded, the Jets rematch occurs at a perfect time. We took the fun out of playing the first four weeks,'' Law said. ''In the last two weeks we've settled everybody down and tried not to play so stiff and look forward to being on the field.</p>
        <p>''We've only got two wins, so, nobody here is happy or overjoyed. We know we could be 4-2 or 5-1 right now, easy. But our goal is to not look or go back in time, only forward.''</p>
