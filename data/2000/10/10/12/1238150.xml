        <p>Global Crossing, the telecommunications upstart that is building a world-wide fiber optic network, seems to have a revolving door.</p>
        <p>Leo Hindery Jr., the former head of AT&amp;T's cable television and Internet unit, who only seven months ago took over as chief executive of Global Crossing, resigned today, the third chief executive to do so in three years. He had succeeded Robert Annunziata, a friend and colleague who lasted a year and, before that, Jack Scanlon, who remains on the board.</p>
        <p>Even in Internet time, such turnover draws attention. Global Crossing's stock price was down $2.44 for the day to close at $21.44. But the company, which is based in Bermuda and has its main offices in Beverly Hills, responded quickly, appointing Thomas J. Casey, a vice chairman with the company since September 1998, as its new chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casey, 48, has 25 years of telecommunications-related experience, both at Merrill Lynch where he was co-head of the global telecommunications investment banking group and as a lawyer working for the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department. He will remain a member of the office of the chairman.</p>
        <p>''I think if you cite one criticism,'' said Megan Kulick, a senior telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch, ''he doesn't have a lot of operational experience.''</p>
        <p>But more important, she added, ''he understands Gary.''</p>
        <p>Gary, of course, is Gary Winnick, chairman and co-founder of the company and the largest shareholder. Mr. Winnick is both a demanding and a hands-on manager who, in three short years, has steered Global from a handful of partners sitting around a table to a company with more than 14,000 employees. ''I think it would be difficult to recruit from the outside a real power chief executive who wants to take a back seat to Gary Winnick,'' Ms. Kulick added.</p>
        <p>That was, in effect, what Mr. Winnick hoped to get when he recruited both Mr. Hindery and Mr. Annunziata, analysts said, giving them stock options worth hundreds of millions of dollars to entice them to Beverly Hills. But Mr. Winnick's expectations of how to build the business clashed at times with the views of both executives, people close to the company said.</p>
        <p>''You recognize not to take a lot of things personally,'' Mr. Annunziata said in an interview this week, noting that a lot of his time was spent meeting with analysts and investors in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hindery, for his part, spent most of his time at GlobalCenter, the Internet and Web-host unit in Sunnyvale, Calif., which is being sold to Exodus Communications for $6.5 billion. He did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The agreement to call it quits between Mr. Hindery and Global Crossing was mutual, the company said. Mr. Hindery will remain chairman and chief executive of GlobalCenter until the sale to Exodus is completed.</p>
        <p>Jack Grubman, Salomon Smith Barney's well-known telecommunications analyst, wrote in a research report yesterday that he believed that Mr. Hindery could be pursuing other options, possibly in public policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casey is getting a somewhat different company than the one Mr. Hindery took over. For one thing, Global has streamlined its operations in recent months, not only selling GlobalCenter, but also reducing its debt. Mr. Casey said the company had plenty of financing available until 2002, a major factor now that investors have turned a cold shoulder to telecommunications stocks. And recurring cash revenue, which was nonexistent only a few years ago, is expected to reach $5.2 billion in fiscal 2000, Ms. Kulick said.</p>
        <p>The company has also shored up its management team. David Walsh, who founded Ixnet Inc., which was bought recently by Global Crossing, is co-chief operating officer, along with Gary Cohen, who joined Global Crossing from I.B.M., where he was responsible for strategy and development of technology for the telecommunications and broadband business customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casey, a lawyer who advised Global Crossing when he worked at Merrill Lynch, has worked closely with Mr. Winnick since the company began. He said that he intended to stay with the company for the long haul. His appointment -- Mr. Casey is a well-regarded deal maker -- does not signal that the company is for sale, he said.</p>
        <p>''Our strategy is not changing,'' he said. ''My job as chief executive is to lead a team that is already in place.''</p>
