        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>MINING THE PUBLIC TRUST?  Yes, there's still plenty of gold in them there California hills. Just ask the state's governor, Gray Davis, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis has raised more than $21 million for his re-election campaign in 2002, eclipsing all records set by his predecessors. But with his aggressive prospecting, the governor has also raised more than a few eyebrows.</p>
        <p>''He's the poster child for the need for campaign finance reform,'' Tony Miller, a former Democratic California secretary of state, lamented recently. ''It's outrageous. The governor's obsession is going to turn people off.''</p>
        <p>The San Francisco Chronicle recently warned, ''Davis risks losing the public trust and respect he needs to govern.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Davis seems not to be greatly concerned, having conducted his own survey on whether he has overdone fund-raising and whether he is perceived as being too beholden to his benefactors. His pollster, Paul Maslin, told The Associated Press this week that the governor believes he is in ''pretty good shape'' on those issues.</p>

        <p>CAMPAIGN PHOTO CONTEST  Republican candidates in the South love to tie their Democratic opponents to the less-than-popular national Democratic ticket. But few have done so with the relish of Richard Vinroot, who is running for governor of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, Mr. Vinroot's campaign Web site announced that the campaign would pay $500 for the best photograph of Vice President Al Gore with Mike Easley, the Democratic candidate. Like many other Southern Democrats, Mr. Easley, the state attorney general, has been conspicuously absent from several of Mr. Gore's appearances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinroot's Web site invites photographers to bring their shots of the two men to Vinroot headquarters to compete for the reward. Mr. Easley, whose early lead in the race has been slipping, says Mr. Vinroot is ''playing games'' and ''slinging mud.''</p>

        <p>ATTACK ON GUN POSITION  Gun control has become a major issue in the House race in Florida's Eighth Congressional District.</p>
        <p>First the Democratic candidate, Linda Chapin, ran television commercials attacking the Republican candidate, Ric Keller, for backing repeal of the Brady gun-control bill. And now the Florida Democratic Party has joined in.</p>
        <p>The Chapin advertisement suggests that American children would be at greater risk should opponents of gun controls succeed in repealing the bill, which provides for background checks on gun buyers. The new Democratic Party advertisement starts with the words ''I'm pro-gun'' in red letters over a picture of Mr. Keller and then follows with the image of a handgun being fired and an announcer saying, ''He wants to get rid of the Brady bill. He even opposes mandatory trigger locks on guns, to keep children safe from harm. He's Ric Keller.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Keller says his gun control views are consistent with his position of being tough on crime.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>CHENEY FAMILY TRIVIA  The Cheneys had some family confusion yesterday. First, Lynne Cheney forgot the name of one of her granddaughters while introducing her husband, Dick, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, to a group outside Chicago. Mrs. Cheney referred to ''Kate, who is 6, Elizabeth, who is 3, and the little baby, Claire.'' The little baby is named Grace. An aide explained that Claire is a daughter's middle name.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Cheney, in remarks on Social Security, got the age of his youngest daughter wrong. ''When my 30-year-old daughter retires, in 37 years -- she'll be 67 then, and that's the year the system is scheduled to go belly up,'' he said. His daughters are 31 and 34.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>LIEBERMAN DRAWS DONORS  In preparing for his run for president, former Senator Bill Bradley cultivated ties to Silicon Valley, as a source of ideas and cash. Now, he is helping his former rival, Vice President Al Gore, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, tap into those connections.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, he squired Mr. Lieberman at a fund-raiser in Atherton, Calif., that pulled in $3.2 million for the Democratic National Committee, the most ever raised at a single event with Mr. Lieberman as the headliner, party officials said. Many of the 120 people present, who paid a minimum of $10,000 apiece, were high-tech magnates who had contributed to Mr. Bradley's campaign.</p>
