      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Microsoft Corporation today released a new version of its popular Office suite for the Macintosh.</p>
        <p>This newest version underscores how the Macintosh market has continued to diverge from the mainstream of the PC world, because although it is similar to the Windows Office suite, it has some intriguing differences that relate to its history, and to the habits of the Macintosh faithful.</p>
        <p>The new version, Office 2001 for Mac, includes a personal information manager and e-mail program called  Entourage that is roughly equivalent to the company's popular Outlook application for its Windows Office suite, but only roughly.</p>
        <p>The addition is also notable because it is a program that William H. Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and chief software architect, four years ago told this reporter would never be available for the Office version for the Macintosh.</p>
        <p>That was, however, before Mr. Gates achieved a rapprochement with Apple Computer under its new chief executive, Steven Jobs, and invested $150 million in the company. Now Microsoft is the largest software developer for the Macintosh.</p>
        <p>''It's clear to me that although Office is a business tool, the Microsoft developers have clearly had the Macintosh audience in mind for their new product,'' said Chris LeTocq, a computer industry analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif.</p>
        <p>Like Outlook, Entourage is intended to blend electronic mail with calendar scheduling, making it possible to organize meetings and appointments and lists of tasks in one integrated program.</p>
        <p>But while the Outlook program is integrated closely with the Microsoft Exchange electronic mail server, Entourage is a stand-alone program, designed that way because Macintosh computers are less common in corporate settings than Windows machines.</p>
        <p>In other ways as well, the Macintosh product is different from the Windows version. The Entourage team said their goal was to cross the boundary between home and office transparently.</p>
        <p>So Entourage automatically retrieves mail from multiple e-mail accounts and enables the user to see all of it in one In box. It also makes it easy for several users of the computer to share the e-mail program.</p>
        <p>In one of its most interesting features, if you go to the address book and enter an address for a contact, there is a button you can click to get driving directions.</p>
        <p>Entourage is also the clearest evidence that as the market for Apple software has declined in recent years, some of the best Macintosh programmers have taken refuge at Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Its Macintosh Business Unit has about 200 employees, about half of whom work at Microsoft's new Silicon Valley campus in Mountain View, Calif.</p>
        <p>Entourage is the most recent work of a small group of these Microsoft programmers, some of whom began developing an electronic mail program called Emailer for the Macintosh in the early 1990's at a tiny company, Fog City Software.</p>
        <p>At that time the Macintosh computer still attracted innovative software first. Microsoft had not yet introduced Windows 95 and was still following the Macintosh lead.</p>
        <p>Among the programmers who worked on Emailer and ended up at Microsoft were Jud Spencer and David Cartwright, who were part of a small team that competed against the Netscape Communications Corporation in the Macintosh browser and electronic mail market.</p>
        <p>The group has produced five versions of the Explorer browser and  has steadily erased Netscape's lead by producing a stable program with a range of features.</p>
        <p>More recently Microsoft has tapped into the community of Macintosh software true believers and hired two young biology students who were dedicated software hobbyists.</p>
        <p>Dan Crevier, 29, had been a graduate student in biophysics at Harvard,  where he was a Macintosh enthusiast.</p>
        <p>''I realized I loved writing software for the Macintosh more than biology,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The same was true for Omar Shahine when he was a biology undergraduate student at Georgetown University. Mr. Shahine's Web page reads: ''You may ask what the heck Biology has to do with my current job. . . . Well, nothing. My years of tinkering with my Macintosh paid off!''</p>
        <p>For Microsoft, harnessing the efforts of Mac true believers has led to a boutique, but profitable, software business.</p>
        <p>David Readerman, a financial analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco, estimates that Microsoft's Office business revenue is $8 billion annually and that the Macintosh Office product may bring in around 6 percent of that market.</p>
        <p>''The Macintosh business is more profitable and its revenue contributes more profit than Windows Office,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And it aims at a different sort of consumer. The company has substantially redesigned its marketing campaign for Office 2001 for Mac, on the idea that Mac users are individualists and iconoclasts, said Kevin Brown, director of Microsoft's Macintosh Business Unit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown, who has worked on both the Windows and Macintosh sides of the Microsoft business, took over from Ben Waldman, who is now working on Microsoft's mobile and wireless business strategy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown started as a Microsoft salesman. During his years in the Macintosh division, however, he has been infected with the fervor for the alternative software world that is still embraced by many of its users as a virtual religion.</p>
        <p>During a recent Macintosh show in New York, Mr. Brown was given the opportunity by Mr. Jobs to give a brief demonstration of some of the features in the new version of Office for Mac.</p>
        <p>Although he said he was nervous going onstage before thousands of the Macintosh faithful for the first time, he chanted a short mantra after each new feature: ''Only on the Mac!''</p>
        <p>After just a few moments, he found that most of the audience was chanting with him.</p>
