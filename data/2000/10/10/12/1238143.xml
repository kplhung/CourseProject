        <p>The Federal Trade Commission announced plans today to subpoena records from 90 pharmaceutical companies to see whether drug industry strategies were keeping lower-cost generic drugs from patients or harming consumers.</p>
        <p>The commission has already filed complaints against two brand companies and two generic companies,  accusing them of making deals that effectively stopped or delayed the generic version of two brand-name drugs. Several other such agreements are under investigation.</p>
        <p>''There are more of these agreements than we know about,'' one commission official said, ''so our desire is to get our arms around the scope of the issue.''</p>
        <p>The economic stakes in the brand-generic drug wars are huge. In the next five years, drugs with $20 billion in annual sales in the United States  will have come off patent, said Robert Pitofsky, the commission chairman. Without patent protection, drug manufacturers can lose significant profits. At the same time, the availability of generic competition can mean considerable savings for consumers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitofsky said the study was meant to ''ensure that the process of bringing new low-cost generic alternatives to the marketplace -- and into the hands of consumers -- is not impeded in ways that are anticompetitive.''</p>
        <p>Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the brand drug makers' trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said that any comment was premature.</p>
        <p>''But,'' Ms. Cottrell said, ''we are confident that any balanced study by the F.T.C. will find the brand-name industry's practices are beneficial to patients.''</p>
        <p>The trade commission's proposed study must undergo a period of public comment and then be approved by White House budget officials. This will delay any investigation until early next year, after the next president takes office.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president, is a critic of the pharmaceutical industry and has said brand-generic agreements unfairly deny consumers the benefits of competition. His Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has not addressed this specific issue, but the pharmaceutical industry has been generally supportive of his candidacy.</p>
        <p>The trade commission's concerns trace to a 1984 law, now known as Hatch-Waxman, which was designed to ease greater competition between generic and brand-name drugs. But one of its co-authors, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said some incentives in the law had been used to delay competition, rather than foster it, costing consumers money and denying patients access to life-saving drugs.</p>
        <p>Whatever the law's shortcomings, however, it has benefited consumers. A study last year, done for a generic company by Paul MacAvoy, a Yale University economist who advised Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, found that from 1985 to 1997, consumers saved $112.5 billion by buying generic drugs.</p>
        <p>Despite the lost sales, the study also found, the brand-name drug companies actually increased their research and development outlays, to $18 billion from $4 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waxman wrote Mr. Pitofsky on Aug. 30 asking the commission to produce a study on the issue of deals between brands and generics. Last month, Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona , and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, introduced legislation to address the potential for manipulation in the 1984 law.</p>
