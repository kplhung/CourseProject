        <p>A federal appeals court ordered the repeal today of two long-established rules that had required radio and television stations to provide free reply time for opponents of political candidates endorsed by the stations and for candidates and others whose integrity had been attacked.</p>
        <p>The decision was a stinging rebuke of the Federal Communications Commission. The court concluded that the agency had dawdled for decades in considering broadcasters' complaints about the rules and had failed to respond to repeated court requests to justify the rules' chilling effect on free speech.</p>
        <p>Broadcasters had long complained that instead of promoting programming about political and controversial subjects, the rules discouraged such shows by imposing stringent reply requirements. Supporters of the rules have said they are a fair price for broadcasters to pay in return for gaining control over the limited and valuable public airwaves.</p>
        <p>The agency did not say whether it would appeal the decision, which comes after more than 30 years of legal wrangling about a series of regulations that had forced television and radio stations to provide free reply time to people who had been criticized on broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Hoping to avert an adverse court ruling, the commission last week temporarily suspended the rules to test during the political season whether they were necessary. The rules were the last significant vestiges of the fairness doctrine, which was imposed by the government at the dawn of radio.</p>
        <p>The 60-day suspension had followed years of deadlock between the two Republican commissioners at the agency, who had wanted to repeal the rules, and two Democratic commissioners, who supported the rules.</p>
        <p>That stalemate was broken last Wednesday after the agency's chairman, William E. Kennard, a Democrat who had disqualified himself from participating in the case because earlier in his career he had helped prepare a legal brief on the issue as a lawyer for the broadcasters, reversed course and decided to participate. He then cast the decisive vote to suspend the regulations.</p>
        <p>Today two judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that the agency's suspension was inadequate and took the highly unusual step of ordering the agency to repeal the rules immediately.</p>
        <p>The judges said the suspension order was not responsive to the court's earlier requests to justify the rules in light of the First Amendment infringement it imposes. Rather, the judges said, the suspension order ''compounds the problems'' that had been identified by the nation's broadcasters, who brought the suit.</p>
        <p>''The commission has delayed final action for two decades, to the detriment of petitioners,'' said the court, in an opinion written by Judge Judith W. Rogers and joined by Chief Judge Harry T. Edwards. (A third judge on the panel stepped down from the court before the decision.)</p>
        <p>''While it acknowledged the need for a prompt decision, the commission failed to act for nine months. Finally, its response consists of an order that further postpones a final decision without any assurance of a final decision,'' Judge Rogers said.</p>
        <p>The court said the agency had repeatedly failed to respond to its requests to justify the rules in light of the court's earlier findings that the regulations ''chill at least some speech and impose at least some burdens on activities at the heart of the First Amendment.''</p>
        <p>''It is folly to suppose that the 60-day suspension and call to update the record cures anything,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Noting that broadcasters had sought a final ruling from the agency to repeal the rules since 1980, the court added, ''if these circumstances do not constitute agency action unreasonably delayed, it is difficult to imagine circumstances that would.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard, who in recent weeks has been repeatedly critical of the broadcasters for failing to provide broader coverage of politics and the presidential debates, said he was ''disappointed with the court's decision to repeal these rules without the benefit of the further inquiry that a temporary suspension of the rules would have provided.''</p>
        <p>In a statement that some industry officials said rang particularly hollow in light of today's ruling, Mr. Kennard vowed to ''move forward promptly'' to consider whether to reinstate the rules.</p>
        <p>As a practical matter, the fate of the rules may rest with the outcome of the national election. While neither Vice President Al Gore nor Gov. George W. Bush has outlined his views on the rules, the issue has split largely along party lines.</p>
        <p>Republicans for years have maintained that the rules should be abandoned, while Democrats have supported them, and even included a plank in the party's platform this summer calling for the readoption of the broader fairness doctrine.</p>
        <p>Broadcasters were delighted today that they had finally prevailed in challenging the two regulations, known as the political editorial and personal attack rules.</p>
        <p>''This is historic,'' said Barbara Cochran, president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association, which filed the lawsuit challenging the rules with the National Association of Broadcasters. ''The effect of it, we will have to see over time.''</p>
        <p>Dan Troy, a lawyer for the broadcasting groups, said the court's decision was significant on three levels.</p>
        <p>''As a matter of administrative law, this shows that the courts will hold agencies to account if they try to play games,'' Mr. Troy said. ''We have seen some games-playing by the agencies, and in particular, the F.C.C. Secondly, we hope this will mean an end to the whole sorry 'fairness doctrine.' The third dimension is a political one. Many people suspect the F.C.C. was playing political games, and that it was not a coincidence that the F.C.C. order came after the Democratic platform adopted a provision calling for the reinstatement of the fairness doctrine.''</p>
        <p>But defenders of the regulations said that the court's decision, while justified in light of the agency's negligence, would remove regulatory incentives on the broadcasters to fair coverage of political campaigns and other controversial subjects.</p>
        <p>''I'm deeply disappointed but not exactly surprised,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a nonpartisan group that promotes diversity on the airwaves. ''What concerns me is the public's right to receive information will be impaired as a consequence of an unfortunate set of circumstances and an agency unable to focus.''</p>
