        <p>I'd like to chime in as a tester for CueCat, a computer peripheral that is used to scan the bar codes accompanying advertisings and articles so your browser will then go to the right Web page (''CueCat Links Printed Ads to Web, but Skeptics Are Wary,'' Sept. 28).</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I'd like to chime in as a tester for CueCat, a computer peripheral that is used to scan the bar codes accompanying advertisings and articles so your browser will then go to the right Web page (''CueCat Links Printed Ads to Web, but Skeptics Are Wary,'' Sept. 28).</p>
        <p>I have the CueCat at home. I always do my reading in the living room on the couch, but my computer is in the study, negating the sort of impulse scanning that the makers seem to think will take place. And all the advertisements have U.R.L.'s that take you to the same page. In fact, you may have to scan several times to get it to work. It seems that the benefits of the service do not yet outweigh the potential risks to private information.</p>
        <p>What would be great? A remote CueCat device that allowed you to scan things you found in the real world so you could get more information about them later from the Internet. That might tip the scales.</p>
