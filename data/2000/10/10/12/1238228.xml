        <p>Three gunmen wearing ski masks waited in a dark parking garage underneath a building here this morning, ambushed two workers and tried to force their way into a bank office on the first floor, the police said.</p>
        <p>But the workers were not employees of the bank branch, which was nearly an hour away from opening, and the gunmen fled empty-handed. The police were still searching for them late today.</p>
        <p>''One would think it is quite the aborted attempt,'' said Deputy Inspector Peter A. Matuza, a Nassau County Police Department spokesman, who said the men had intended to rob the bank.</p>
        <p>The incident began at 8:10 a.m., when the gunmen confronted a man walking in the garage under the Fleet Bank building at 1035 Stewart Avenue, forced him into an elevator and hit him on the back of the head with a handgun.</p>
        <p>The man was not seriously injured, the police said. Other workers in the building said he was an officer for an Internet company there.</p>
        <p>The gunmen -- each wearing a black ski mask, blue jeans and work boots and brandishing a silver handgun -- took the man up to the second story, but realized the bank was not on that floor. They rode down to the first floor, where they forced a second man, a building maintenance worker, onto the elevator.</p>
        <p>''They asked him what time the bank opened,'' said Henry Massada, who identified himself as a co-owner of the building and said he spoke with the worker after the incident. ''Then they went up and down the different floors, trying to find an employee or a way into the bank, I guess. And when they figured out that nobody was there to open the door for them, they left.''</p>
        <p>At one point, the police said, when the elevator doors opened onto the second floor, the robbers waved guns at two other men working in that office.</p>
        <p>When the gunmen took the elevator back down to the ground floor, one of them said to the other two, ''Let's get out of here,'' Inspector Matuza said. The suspects then forced the victims to lie face down on the elevator floor and disappeared, the police said. The gunmen most likely escaped through the same parking garage they used to enter the building, the police said.</p>
        <p>Inspector Matuza said it was unclear at first whether the gunmen were still in the building or whether they had taken any hostages. Officers from the department's Bureau of Special Operations, wearing heavy body armor, entered the building and made a floor-by-floor search that lasted nearly three hours.</p>
        <p>Dianna Mandel, who works in the building, pulled her car into the parking garage about 8:30 a.m., just as two bank employees she recognized were racing out in a sport utility vehicle. They warned her not to go inside.</p>
        <p>''They told me to turn around and get out of the building -- there are three guys with guns,'' said Ms. Mandel, of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>It was a tense moment, she said,  but in retrospect it was almost comical that the robbery attempt seemed so poorly planned. ''Because the bandits, the thieves, don't know what time the bank opens,'' she said.</p>
