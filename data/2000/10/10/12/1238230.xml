        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas played a central role in tonight's presidential debate as the governor and Vice President Al Gore clashed over the state's problem of uninsured residents, its environment and a hate crimes bill that failed to pass the State Legislature in 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has criticized Mr. Bush's record in Texas on and off for months, prompted the most heated exchange when he cited statistics that rank the state at the bottom or near it in several national health indexes, including having 1.4 million uninsured children, among them about 600,000 who are eligible for Medicaid but are not yet enrolled in it. Mr. Gore said Texas ranked 49th in the number of uninsured women and children.</p>
        <p>Asked by the moderator, Jim Lehrer, whether Mr. Gore's statistics were inaccurate, Mr. Bush did not directly respond, instead emphasizing his administration's recent enrollment of roughly 110,000 uninsured children in the federal Child Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and its overall spending of $4.7 billion on the uninsured in Texas. Mr. Bush also said that the percentage of uninsured Texans compared with the state's total population had gone down while the percentage of uninsured Americans had risen.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas played a central role in tonight's presidential debate as the governor and Vice President Al Gore clashed over the state's problem of uninsured residents, its environment and a hate crimes bill that failed to pass the State Legislature in 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has criticized Mr. Bush's record in Texas on and off for months, prompted the most heated exchange when he cited statistics that rank the state at the bottom or near it in several national health indexes, including having 1.4 million uninsured children, among them about 600,000 who are eligible for Medicaid but are not yet enrolled in it. Mr. Gore said Texas ranked 49th in the number of uninsured women and children.</p>
        <p>Asked by the moderator, Jim Lehrer, whether Mr. Gore's statistics were inaccurate, Mr. Bush did not directly respond, instead emphasizing his administration's recent enrollment of roughly 110,000 uninsured children in the federal Child Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and its overall spending of $4.7 billion on the uninsured in Texas. Mr. Bush also said that the percentage of uninsured Texans compared with the state's total population had gone down while the percentage of uninsured Americans had risen.</p>
        <p>''You can quote all the numbers you want,'' Mr. Bush replied, ''but I'm telling you, we care about our people in Texas.''</p>
        <p>For decades, Texas has ranked near the bottom nationally in public health. A study by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured found that in 1998 roughly 27 percent of Texans ages 19 to 65 were without insurance, compared with 19.7 percent nationally. The figure was worse for poor children, with 39.1 percent without health insurance in 1998.</p>
        <p>These problems, of course, predate Mr. Bush and can be traced to a host of causes, including the state's historic poverty levels, particularly along the border with Mexico.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's administration has been criticized as failing to do enough to address health concerns. During the 1999 legislative session, Mr. Bush lobbied to limit the coverage levels for the federal CHIP program to children with family incomes of 150 percent of the poverty line, though the federal law allowed coverage of up to 200 percent of poverty. Ultimately, the lawmakers approved the higher level, thereby providing coverage for 200,000 children who would have been excluded under Mr. Bush's proposal. The governor signed the bill into law.</p>
        <p>On the environment, Mr. Gore noted that Houston has ''just become the smoggiest city in the country, and Texas is No. 1 in industrial pollution.'' Mr. Bush countered that while Texas is ''a big industrial state,'' it had reduced its industrial waste by 11 percent since he took office in 1995. He also noted that the state had cleaned up 450 formerly polluted industrial sites since then.</p>
        <p>In fact, both candidates were accurate. Since 1988, when new federal pollution reporting provisions were enacted, Texas has significantly reduced its emissions of industrial emissions into the air. This includes emissions like benzene, ammonia and other industrial byproducts. But Texas still ranks first in industrial emissions, excluding mining waste.</p>
        <p>The state is also battling a growing smog problem. Last year, Houston surpassed Los Angeles for the most days violating the federal ozone standard. This year, Houston is again leading the nation, and city and state officials are struggling to complete a plan to bring the city into compliance. Dallas, El Paso and Port Arthur-Beaumont have also been cited for exceeding federal ozone levels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush referred to a 1999 electric deregulation law that included a stipulation that utilities must make mandatory reduction in their emissions of nitrogen oxide, one of the building blocks of smog. Mr. Bush signed this bill, but his emphasis during that session was another bill that created a voluntary program to bring outdated petrochemical plants into compliance. These plants, more so than utilities, are the state's leading industrial polluters.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have criticized this law as ineffective, and one group reported this month that it had amounted to reductions of less than 1 percent of emissions since 1999. Mr. Bush has argued that the cuts are greater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore criticized Mr. Bush for not supporting an expanded and toughened hate crimes bill before the Texas Legislature last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush replied, ''We're happy with our laws on the books.''</p>
        <p>The measure to which Mr. Gore referred, the most contentious issue  before the Legislature in 1999, was named after James Byrd Jr., the black man who was dragged to death in Jasper, Tex., a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The bill would have defined a hate crime as one motivated by the victim's race, ethnicity, sex, disability, religion or sexual orientation. Texas has a hate crimes law, but critics contend it is too vague to enforce.</p>
        <p>Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the Texas Senate, blocked the bill last year largely because many did not want to extend the protection to gays.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush never said during the legislative session whether he would have signed the proposed legislation, but he did not push for its adoption.</p>
        <p>In the debate tonight, Mr. Bush declared that the three men convicted of killing Mr. Byrd had been sentenced to death. In fact, two received the death penalty and one was sentenced to life in prison.</p>
