        <p>Pressed polypropylene foam, the humble packing material used to protect products in shipping, has been innovatively adapted to furniture by the London designer Ross Lovegrove.

        <p>Think of these stools and chairs as giant Styrofoam coffee cups just waiting to be called into service as seating. Mr. Lovegrove's pieces in silvery gray or metallic blue were shown at the International Furniture Fair in Milan in April and have landed in New York this month at Moss, 150 Greene Street (Houston Street).</p>
