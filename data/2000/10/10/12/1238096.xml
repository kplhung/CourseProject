        <p>JOEL SCHUMACHER didn't know what he was looking for at the 26th Street flea market, but he found it anyway. The director, whose new film, ''Tigerland,'' opened on Friday, stopped in New York recently to check out Indian rugs, hardware, workbenches, African masks, doorknobs, medallions, fixtures and handicrafts for a new home he is building near Santa Barbara.</p>
        <p>''I have beyond eclectic taste,'' he said. ''I believe everything works together as long as it's pure and made by hand. I also like everything not to be perfect, so people can spill things. I hate precious decoration.''</p>

        <p>JOEL SCHUMACHER didn't know what he was looking for at the 26th Street flea market, but he found it anyway. The director, whose new film, ''Tigerland,'' opened on Friday, stopped in New York recently to check out Indian rugs, hardware, workbenches, African masks, doorknobs, medallions, fixtures and handicrafts for a new home he is building near Santa Barbara.</p>
        <p>''I have beyond eclectic taste,'' he said. ''I believe everything works together as long as it's pure and made by hand. I also like everything not to be perfect, so people can spill things. I hate precious decoration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumacher, an artful magpie who moved from New York to Los Angeles two decades ago, often hits Portobello Road in London, and flea markets and swap meets in Silver Lake in Los Angeles. For years he has shopped at the 26th Street flea market on Avenue of the Americas. This Sunday he spotted a $300 African wooden mask, put it down, then circled back later to buy it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumacher has a house in Bel Air crammed literally to the rafters with decidedly unprecious stuff. And now, because he is building that new home, he has reason to shop anew. (As if he needed a reason.)</p>
        <p>Although he has made millions on big-budget films like ''Batman and Robin'' and ''The Client,'' he was no spendthrift when it came to shopping the market, bargaining over iron horse-head clothes pegs for his new guest bedroom (two pairs for less than $20), ornaments for his concrete fireplaces (a medallion embossed with a torso of an imposing man -- $30 -- and he liked it even before a reporter pointed out that it said ''Oskar Schindler'') and Indian rugs.</p>
        <p>''I like the condition it's in,'' he said as he looked at a worn Navajo rug at American Indian Treasures Gallery, a store on the second floor of a building on West 25th Street. He passed on another that had the ancient mark resembling a swastika, explaining, ''it's hard to show people, they don't understand.'' He uses Indian blankets as throws and stacks them on the floor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumacher, whose ''Tigerland,'' about soldiers training for Vietnam, is a somewhat atypical film for him, began collecting Indian rugs when he lived in New York in the 1960's. ''I bought my first for $50,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The new house, meant to be a casual getaway, is clad in barn siding shipped from Maine. ''I bought some 200-year-old barns in Maine,'' he said. ''Got some land on top of a mountain with a view out over the ocean. I really wanted to live in a barn, but it's hard to build a house inside a barn. It's easier to build the house and then hang the siding on it.''</p>
        <p>It's also a better way to build to California code. His architect, Don Nulty of Santa Barbara, said, ''I think in California that's the way you'd have to do it -- build yourself a strong structure first.'' The house won't be finished until February, but Mr. Schumacher has already bought old workbenches from Paula Rubenstein on Prince Street in New York (''She's got great taste''). He uses  them for consoles and desks, paired with ergonomic chairs. ''It's cool to put things together like that,'' he said. ''Some old bronze desk lamp and a state-of-the-art halogen lamp in case you really want to do some work. There are two kinds of lighting systems in my house, one for parties, when you want to look good, and one for actually getting work done.''</p>
        <p>He also shops in Atwater, Calif. ''But there you have to drive,'' he said. ''Here it's all so close, you can walk to everything.'' And ''on a much higher scale,'' he said, he buys from Mike Haskell in Montecito. He continued, ''He has beyond exquisite taste, museum taste, but it's not for bargain hunters.''</p>
        <p>While studying design and display at the Parsons School of Design in the 1950's, Mr. Schumacher, who is now 61, lived in a $60-a-month apartment at 444 West 57th Street with three roommates, ''a place with the bathtub in the kitchen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He worked his way through Parsons doing windows at Bendel's, became an art director for television commercials, then worked as a film costume designer, including on Woody Allen's ''Sleeper'' and ''Interiors.'' ''Woody had a great effect on my life,'' he said. He moved into production design, and eventually directing and writing screenplays.</p>
        <p>His new, gritty movie was made for around $7 million, with no makeup and no stars. Similarly, he prefers honest materials for houses. The first house he bought in Los Angeles was Rudolph Valentino's stable.</p>
        <p>He is making huge concrete fireplaces at the new house. ''You pour cement and use a great big barn lumber shelf for a mantel,'' he said. The Schindler medallion will be pressed into the wet cement, along with medals and crosses. ''It gives me something to look at when I get tired of looking at the fire,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I'm a big believer in poured concrete,'' he said. ''I use it for kitchen counters and bathtubs. It's such an inexpensive form of architecture. I like that it looks unfinished.''</p>
        <p>He grew particularly excited at some old brass wall fixtures from the New York subway system at one booth. ''I like rugged, oversized things,'' he said. ''Chandeliers are usually too dainty for me. Things like andirons and chandeliers were usually made for the rich, and because of that they're too frou-frou for me. I'll put these in my entryway with parchment shades on them, and hang them over an old workbench.'' The brass fixtures were $150 each.</p>
        <p>''When people put their houses together, they are under the tyranny of what other people will think,'' he said. ''The fear is that you will bring shame to your entire family with your choices. I want my friends to be comfortable at my place, but they're just visiting. I live in it. I want it to be the way I want it to be.''</p>
