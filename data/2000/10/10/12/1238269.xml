        <p>Jean Stottlemyre, the wife of the Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before yesterday's game.</p>
        <p>She said her husband, who learned that he had cancer in April and left the team Sept. 11 for a stem cell transplant, is making good progress and is optimistic he could rejoin the team in a limited capacity.</p>
        <p>''The prognosis is great,'' she said. ''We take it a week at a time. As far as him coming back, there is a possibility that if we get into the World Series, that he may be back here. I don't think he could travel with the team because they don't really want him flying for a couple of months, but there's a good chance. We hope.''</p>
        <p>She said her husband watches all the Yankees' games on television. She said she is in good spirits, too. She had been asked earlier this week to throw out the first pitch, and she said after she threw it that she was still shaking from the excitement.</p>
        <p>Asked if she practiced pitching at home, she nodded and said, ''Up against the wall.''</p>
