        <p>If it was good enough for Alfonse M. D'Amato when he ran for re-election to the Senate in 1998, then it is good enough for Hillary Rodham Clinton as she runs for the Senate in 2000.</p>
        <p>Or so it would seem from a new advertisement released by Mrs. Clinton yesterday. The ad attacks Representative Rick A. Lazio for precisely the thing that Mr. D'Amato attacked Charles E. Schumer for when Mr. Schumer challenged Mr. D'Amato: sneaking out of Washington so he could campaign.</p>

        <p>If it was good enough for Alfonse M. D'Amato when he ran for re-election to the Senate in 1998, then it is good enough for Hillary Rodham Clinton as she runs for the Senate in 2000.</p>
        <p>Or so it would seem from a new advertisement released by Mrs. Clinton yesterday. The ad attacks Representative Rick A. Lazio for precisely the thing that Mr. D'Amato attacked Charles E. Schumer for when Mr. Schumer challenged Mr. D'Amato: sneaking out of Washington so he could campaign.</p>
        <p>''Recently, Rick Lazio skipped 59 of 60 votes in Congress,'' the announcer declares at the start of the ad. Then, in the space of 15 brisk seconds, it lists, in stark white type against a black background, the votes Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, missed in Congress this month. In much the same way, almost exactly two years ago this month, Mr. D'Amato ticked off votes that Mr. Schumer missed for almost three straight weeks during the 1998 campaign.</p>
        <p>News of the new Clinton ad produced a topsy-turvy day in the New York Senate race. As it turns out, many of the players from 1998 are still on the scene today -- either as campaign advisers or commentators -- and both Democrats and Republicans, apparently unabashed, raced to the opposite side of the ideological field and marshaled the same arguments that had been used against them the last time.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, for example, Howard Wolfson, then the press secretary for Mr. Schumer, characterized the attack on Mr. Schumer's missed votes as ''fraudulent.'' Yesterday, that word was not used by Mr. Wolfson, who as communications director for Ms. Clinton, excoriated Mr. Lazio for his absences from Washington.</p>
        <p>''Congressman Lazio is trying to tell New Yorkers that he is an effective legislator for New York, and he has stopped doing his job,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''He has put his own career and ambitions ahead of New York.''</p>
        <p>Asked how this differed from Mr. Schumer in 1998, he responded: ''If you look at 1998, then-Congressman Schumer was trying to make his votes. The difference is that Congressman Lazio has essentially stopped doing his job completely.''</p>
        <p>Over at Republican headquarters, Mr. Lazio's aides sounded, well, the same way Mr. Wolfson sounded two years ago: they complained that Mrs. Clinton was referring to absences for ceremonial votes, or votes on which Mr. Lazio's presence would not have made a difference, for the sake of some political points. ''Either Mrs. Clinton has no understanding of the legislative process, or she is blatantly trying to deceive New Yorkers,'' said Bill Dal Col, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Among the votes that Mr. Lazio missed, and that were listed in Mrs. Clinton's ad,  were financing for 100,000 new teachers and  the Violence against Women Act. The ad said Mr. Lazio was present for a vote on a 3 percent congressional payroll increase, but the measure that was cited was in fact part of a larger Treasury bill that raised salaries for a wide range of federal employees, including members of Congress.</p>
        <p>Even Kieran P. Mahoney, the D'Amato consultant who helped direct the attack against Mr. Schumer in 1998,  said it was unfair of Mrs. Clinton to use the attack against Mr. Lazio. The difference, Mr. Mahoney said, was that Mr. Lazio had a nearly perfect voting record until Labor Day, when he accelerated his campaigning, whereas Mr. Schumer had missed votes for nearly a year before his election. Unlike Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lazio did not have to face a primary for his party's nomination; he entered the race in June.</p>
        <p>All of which begs the question: Does this kind of political attack work? Mr. Schumer's aides long insisted that the attacks by Mr.  D'Amato had no effect on Mr. Schumer, who went on to defeat Mr.  D'Amato's bid for a third term. That said, the fact that Mrs. Clinton is now embracing the same line would appear to be a belated affirmation of the effectiveness of the tactic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer's chief strategist, Hank Morris, declined to comment yesterday. But Mr. Schumer allowed that he believed attacks on a legislator's attendance record could be very potent. ''It is an effective line of attack,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer said that he believed it had taken a toll on his campaign, until it was revealed that Mr.  D'Amato had missed dozens of votes on the Suffolk County Board of Supervisors when he first ran for Senate. ''Then it just evaporated,'' Mr. Schumer said.</p>
        <p>But there is one practical effect to attacking voting records, as Mr. Schumer learned: It is harder to skip votes in Washington when public attention is suddenly turned on your attendance.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Lazio cut short a day of campaigning in Buffalo to return to Washington for votes on appropriation bills, among them an agricultural bill that included provisions for upstate farmers and apple growers. Although Mrs. Clinton's aides seized on this as evidence that he was scurrying in response to the ads, Mr. Lazio's aides had, for several days, said he intended to go to Washington for the spending bills.</p>
        <p>His advisers expressed incredulity at learning that Mrs. Clinton had borrowed a page from Mr. D'Amato's book. ''This is pure Clinton-think: They will say and do anything to win,'' said Dan McLagan, Mr. Lazio's spokesman. ''And do it with a straight face. It's amazing.''</p>
        <p>While he was upstate yesterday, Mr. Lazio weighed in on a dispute between the Seneca Indian tribe and New York State over 18,000 acres of land. Mr. Lazio argued that a solution to the land claims dispute did not require federal intervention, but should be resolved locally. Mr. Lazio also toured Niagara Falls High School, where every student has been given a laptop computer, and met for about half an hour with Bishop Henry J. Mansell of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo.</p>
        <p>In a series of speeches over the past two days, Mr. Lazio has moved away from asserting that the upstate economy had ''turned a corner,'' after critics, including some upstate Republicans, said he appeared insensitive to lingering economic distress. Mrs. Clinton has criticized Mr. Lazio for not having an economic plan to benefit the upstate region.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the New York State United Teachers group disclosed that it had bought more than $500,000 worth of time on radio stations for advertisements that might be used, the group acknowledged, to help bolster Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. Such advertisements are barred under an agreement between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton on campaign spending, though that deal has appeared increasingly shaky. The union said it would not place such ads if the deal remained in place, and would use the time for get-out-the-vote ads.</p>
