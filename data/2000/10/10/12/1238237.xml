        <p>Two toddlers were attacked by a dog outside the Loving Arms Day Care Center at 156-04 113th Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, yesterday.</p>
        <p>The dog, described by the police as either a Rottweiler or a pit bull,  followed an unidentified woman onto the porch of the center, where it bit a 2-year-old boy, whose lip, face and right shoulder were injured, the police said. The day care operator chased the dog away, hitting it with a broom, but it attacked a 4-year-old boy outside, injuring his left arm, the police said.</p>
