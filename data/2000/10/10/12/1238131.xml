        <p>The European Commission officially gave a green light today to Time Warner's $165 billion merger with America Online, but the companies face bigger objections from antitrust regulators in Washington.</p>
        <p>After four months of scrutiny, the European Commission took a fairly relaxed position and focused its demands almost entirely on preventing the merged company from dominating online music distribution.</p>
        <p>But competition officials played down some of the biggest concerns raised in the United States, saying those concerns were not a problem in the European market.</p>
        <p>At least in Europe, commission officials said, the combined company would not be able to dominate online distribution of movies, services like instant messaging or access to the high-speed broadband networks of the future.</p>
        <p>Those issues are central to deliberations at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, where both regulators and rivals warn that the merged company would own one of the country's biggest cable television networks as well as be the biggest provider of online services.</p>
        <p>In Europe, by contrast, Time Warner does not own any cable networks and America Online does not rank higher than being the second-largest online service in any individual country.</p>
        <p>As expected, America Online pledged to sever ties with Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate that owns 50 percent of AOL Europe and a smaller stake in AOL Compuserve France.</p>
        <p>The Bertelsmann Music Group is one of the biggest music distributors and is a direct rival of Time Warner's music subsidiary, Warner Music. Under the deal with European regulators, the two companies also promised to keep AOL's networks open to music produced by rivals and not prevent sales of Warner's music over competing networks.</p>
        <p>As a practical matter, Bertelsmann and America Online had already agreed to sever ties months ago. Just a few days after the Time Warner merger was announced, Bertelsmann's chief executive resigned from the board of America Online and soon announced that Bertelsmann would sell its stake.</p>
        <p>The reasons had nothing to do with concerns in Brussels, but rather with Bertelsmann's refusal to be partners with a major rival in music, publishing and television.</p>
        <p>The European decision became much easier last week, after Time Warner reluctantly agreed to abandon a separate $20 billion alliance between its Warner Music subsidiary and the EMI Group in Britain.</p>
        <p>Mario Monti, the European Commission's top antitrust official, had insisted that such an alliance would have reduced the number of major music distributors to four from five.</p>
        <p>''Our biggest concern was music,'' said Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman on competition issues for the European Commission. ''With the separation of Bertelsmann and with EMI out of the way, they no longer have a critical mass.''</p>
        <p>In its announcement, which had been expected since the Warner-EMI alliance was withdrawn, the European Commission said the Time Warner-America Online merger would create the first Internet provider capable of distributing its own brand of music and entertainment over its own distribution network.</p>
        <p>The commission rejected arguments by rivals of Time Warner, like the Walt Disney Company, which had warned that the combined company could dominate access to broadband networks as well as the online distribution of movies and television entertainment.</p>
        <p>The commission said those fears about access to broadband Internet access were unfounded because neither of the companies owns a network of that kind in Europe. And in contrast to its fears about the competition in online music, the commission said Time Warner's position in video entertainment ''cannot be regarded as dominant in Europe.''</p>
        <p>Commission officials also brushed aside worries about America Online's dominance in instant messaging services, which allow customers to find each other online and flash messages to each other. America Online's so-called Buddy System is one of the service's biggest attractions for many customers, and rivals argue that it tends to dissuade them from jumping to rival services.</p>
        <p>Here, too, however, European officials concluded that the company had a far less dominant position in Europe than in the United States.</p>
        <p>The decision announced today was a milestone in the globalization of antitrust regulation. With American and European corporations merging into Goliaths, they are facing scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Even though both Time Warner and America Online are American companies, European regulators had the power to challenge and even to block the merger if convinced it would reduce competition in Europe.</p>
        <p>But the decision was remarkably free from nationalistic politics or objections about the invasion of American culture in Europe. Throughout the four-month investigation, European officials weighed the merger strictly in terms of its impact on competition.</p>
        <p>''By allowing AOL to team up effectively with three of the five music majors, the resulting integrated company could have dominated the online music distribution market,'' Mr. Monti said in a statement today.</p>
        <p>In a brief statement, America Online and Time Warner said they were pleased by the decision and were still proceeding in discussions with the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
