      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Both houses of Congress overwhelmingly approved a bill today that would stiffen civil and criminal penalties for failing to report defects in cars and tires.</p>
        <p>The move is an unusually swift reaction to the failure of industry and regulators to recognize a problem with Bridgestone/Firestone tires on Ford Explorers until more than 100 people had been killed.</p>
        <p>But the bill, which passed the House on a voice vote early today, dismayed some consumer advocates, who said that the sanctions were unlikely to ever be applied and that the new law was in some ways a step backward.</p>
        <p>The Senate Commerce Committee had unanimously approved a tougher bill, but the full House did not consider it because Senator John McCain of Arizona, the main supporter, could not win unanimous consent to do so.</p>
        <p>The Senate this evening approved the bill 95 to 0, without debate. The administration had voiced support for both House and Senate versions, and a White House spokesman said the president would sign the House bill.</p>
        <p>The legislation requires auto companies that replace motor vehicle parts in a foreign country for safety reasons to notify American regulators, and it requires tire manufacturers to give regulators data on warranty claims.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company replaced Firestone tires for owners of its Explorer sport utility vehicles in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela but did not tell American regulators.</p>
        <p>In testimony, Ford executives referred to the replacements as ''a customer satisfaction issue'' and said it was not related to safety; how the new legislation would have applied to the Firestone-Explorer problem was not immediately clear .</p>
        <p>The bill also requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set new standards for tires, replacing standards set three decades ago, before the advent of radial tires. But that is something that the agency planned to do already and that the tire industry itself has called for.</p>
        <p>It also requires manufacturers to give the government data on warranty claims. Ford used Firestone's warranty data to demonstrate a pattern of problems with certain Firestone products.</p>
        <p>But the bill also establishes new protections on data obtained by the government from the companies, which consumer advocates complained about bitterly.</p>
        <p>''The deficiencies are earth-shaking,'' said Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, and a former head of the highway safety agency. The Freedom of Information Act, she said, carries the presumption that information will be released, but this legislation reverses that, permitting release only if the Transportation Secretary approves. Getting information from her former agency is already difficult, she said.</p>
