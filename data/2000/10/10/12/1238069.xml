        <p>IF cell phones are to become the mobile communication device of the future, as many experts predict, there is one major hurdle to overcome: the phone keypad was made for entering numbers, not letters. Trying to type a message on a phone is akin to typing on a shrunken keyboard that is missing two-thirds of its characters.</p>
        <p>For years, promoters of wireless devices have assured users that the problem will disappear once phones and personal digital assistants evolve into all-in-one gadgets with styluses or miniature qwerty keyboards. And some devices are getting close, like the BlackBerry pager, which has 33 tiny buttons that people use to type text messages. But for most people -- especially the millions who have mobile phones and are being encouraged to sign up for wireless Internet service -- the limitations of the phone keypad are very real.</p>
        <p>To combat the problem, a handful of companies have developed new technologies designed to make it easier for people to enter wireless messages. One of the products, Tegic Communications software called T9 Text Input, is being loaded onto most new cell phones. And a few other companies are attempting to persuade cell-phone carriers and manufacturers that consumers will prefer their solutions instead.</p>
        <p>Without these products, most people who want to type text on a cell phone must resort to a process called multitapping. To get out even a short word like ''ugh,'' for example, a person must tap the 8 key twice (U is the second letter displayed on the 8 key), the 4 key once (G is the first letter on that key) and then the 4 key twice (to arrive at an H).</p>
        <p>Multitapping is ''universally despised,'' said Howard Gutowitz, chief executive of Eatoni Ergonomics, one of the companies that has developed alternatives to T9 Text Input.</p>
        <p>T9 tries to predict what someone might be trying to type. Instead of having the user push a key repeatedly to get a certain letter, the software pulls up the letter that is the most likely choice, based on the frequency of words in normal conversation.</p>
        <p>For example, someone hitting the 4 key will first pull up the letter I because more words start with I than with G or H. As the user types more letters, the prediction process continues until all characters have been entered. If the sequence of characters seems to point to a word with a different first letter, the software will change the letter on the display to arrive at the likely word.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-nine out of 30 times, T9 will get the word right,'' said Don Davidge, vice president for sales and marketing at Tegic, which is owned by America Online. When T9 gets the word wrong, users click the Next key, which is sometimes simply the star key, to pull up the second-most-likely word.</p>
        <p>Not everyone thinks that T9 is the final answer. Mr. Gutowitz, of Eatoni Ergonomics, says that his company has a better solution. The simplest version of Eatoni's new software is called LetterWise, which is also designed to anticipate what someone is trying to type with a phone's keypad. But instead of focusing on predicting words, LetterWise predicts letters. The program relies on analyses that show how often certain letters appear next to other letters.</p>
        <p>On average, it takes 1.18 taps with LetterWise to produce the desired letter. When multitapping without any extra help, it takes an average of 2.2 taps per letter, Eatoni says. (The company has created a computer program that runs keypad simulations for more than 100 million words in the English language.) The engineers at Eatoni say that LetterWise takes up about 3 kilobytes of memory on a cell phone, compared with 40 to 60 kilobytes for T9.</p>
        <p>A second Eatoni product, called WordWise, was developed to make the typing process even faster. It allows users to shift  into a mode in which only one letter is assigned to each number on the keypad. (Those letters, as chosen by Eatoni, are C, E, H, L, N, S, T, Y.) By shifting into that mode (by hitting a separate key, like the pound sign or volume button), users can reduce the number of times they have to look at the screen to confirm what they type.</p>
        <p>For example, by using the shift key and the numeral 2, they can be certain that they are typing C. Without the shift, the system has to choose between only two letters, A and B, instead of three. Eatoni, which unveiled the software last month, is trying to sell both LetterWise and WordWise to cell phone carriers and manufacturers.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, a company called ecrio  Ecrio is betting that even with text-input software for telephone keypads, nobody is really going to want to type using the tiny keys on cell phones. It imagines that people will use their cell phones in tandem with personal digital assistants.</p>
        <p>Yet ecrio does not want people to resort to a shorthand system or the tiny P.D.A. keyboards. It has come up with a way to let the user send digital notes by jotting them down longhand, with a stylus.</p>
        <p>''Simply hand-write a little note and send it off,'' said Nagesh Challa, president and chief executive of ecrio, during a recent demonstration.</p>
        <p>The ecrio platform, which was announced last month, is designed for Palm, Handspring Visor or Pocket PC devices; people can use styluses to write on those devices' L.C.D. (liquid-crystal display) screens. The ecrio software works by turning the jots into highly compressed images, like JPEG's, that can be viewed as easily as text-based e-mail messages and sent wirelessly to handheld or regular computers. Since notes are sent as images instead of text, the software is ideal for people who sketch diagrams or jot notes in a language that is not handled by the text-editing systems of pocket computers, Mr. Challa said.</p>
        <p>Ecrio envisions the software being used at least two ways. A person could send a handwritten message using a handheld computer with a wireless connection, or a person could transmit the message from a handheld computer to a cell phone (using a short-range wireless system like Bluetooth), and have the phone send the message.</p>
        <p>The latter option, Mr. Challa said, would let people participate in the text-messaging craze without buying entirely new gadgets.</p>
        <p>Until such Bluetooth-enabled devices come on the market, cell phone users do at least have the option of receiving ecrio images, viewing them on the screens that come with Web-enabled phones. To send a message back, however, they may have to resort to maneuvering over the cell phone's minuscule keypad with the tips of their fingers, one peck at a time.</p>
