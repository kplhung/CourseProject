        <p>In the world of fuel cells and batteries, zinc-air systems get little respect, despite packing plenty of energy in small volumes while using cheap and environmentally benign materials as a power source.</p>
        <p>They have their niches. Zinc-air batteries, which generate power through a chemical reaction between zinc and oxygen, are common in hearing aids, for example. But after decades of research and hundreds of millions of dollars of investment, it is going to take some significant breakthroughs to shake their also-ran image.</p>
        <p>Sadeg Faris seems to think that Evonyx, one of several technology development companies he owns, has quietly made enough progress that the moment has come for a little showing off. What better way, he decided, than to drive an electric car from the Evonyx laboratory in Hawthorne, N.Y., in Westchester County north of New York City, to Detroit without recharging? Such a 600-mile journey would smash the 373-mile record the Solectria Corporation set in 1996 for electric vehicle range on one charge, and would end up right under the noses of the big Detroit auto executives who long ago wrote off metal-air technology.</p>
        <p>So four months ago, Evonyx quietly bought two Honda Insight gasoline-and-electric hybrid cars, stripped out the engines and drive trains, and began to convert them into full-fledged electric vehicles. The two vehicles are scheduled to set off at 6:30 a.m. today from Hawthorne with a goal of arriving in Detroit by 2 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The back seat and trunk areas are packed with batteries, but Evonyx says the system could easily be much more compact because the company cobbled it together without help from any auto engineers or auto electronics specialists. Evonyx intends to sacrifice speed on Interstate 80's hills in Pennsylvania to extend the cars' range, but it aims to average at least 45 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>''The mission is to get people to revisit their assumptions about metal-air technology,'' Mr. Faris said. ''We don't claim we have a product.''</p>
        <p>The company does, however, have a small-scale manufacturing line turning out components for a range of potential applications, from long-lasting AA batteries to vehicle and building power systems, thanks to an investment by Niagara Mohawk, an electric utility that has supported Evonyx research. Evonyxhas also acquired land to construct a factory in Taiwan that would supply power systems to the Asian scooter market.</p>
