        <p>Poets' Corner  The Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney will read a previously unpublished Robert Lowell sonnet about Beowulf in a ''Poets' Tribute to Robert Lowell'' at 8 tonight at the 92nd Street Y. Besides Mr. Heaney, a translator of ''Beowulf,'' the participating poets include Frank Bidart, Derek Walcott, Robert Pinsky, Heather McHugh and David Gewanter.

        <p>Changing Times  The exhibition begins with the year 1936. Regional and social realism formed the prevailing style in art. The exhibition ends 10 years later, as Abstract Expressionism burst out of a synthesis of European modern art and the tumultuous social and political changes between the Depression and the end of World War II, as well as a rebellion against realism. In reconsidering this era, ''The American Avant-Garde: A Decade of Change, 1936-1946,'' which opened yesterday at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Conn., brings together more than 60 paintings by 44 artists. Among them are Grant Wood, Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko and Hans Hoffman. The show continues through Dec. 31. Information: (203) 869-0376.</p>
        <p>Incoming Wave  What musical work lasts 101 minutes, has 12 movements and calls for 5 soloists, an 80-member mixed chorus, a 40-member children's choir and an orchestra? The answer is Philip Glass's Symphony No. 5, which will receive its North American premiere at 7:30 on Wednesday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as the opening attraction of the 2000 Next Wave Festival. Continuing into December and complemented by film, live music and humanities programs, the festival will present 13 dance, music and theater works from around the world. Information: (718) 636-4100.</p>
        <p>Rock and Rollers  He was a playwright. But history records the name Aloys Senefelder because he is credited with inventing lithography in Germany in the 1790's. Taking its name from the Greek for writing on stone, lithography is a printing process that produces a remarkable range of color. This process, which achieved peaks of popularity in Paris in the 1890's and in Southern California in the 1960's and 70's, is the subject of the exhibition that opens on Wednesday and continues through Jan. 15 at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif. Among the artists represented in ''From Paris to Pasadena: An Overview of Color Lithography, 1890-1975'' are Bonnard, Toulouse-Lautrec, Klee, Picasso, Richard Diebenkorn and Ed Ruscha. Information: (626) 449-6840.</p>
