        <p>The Virgin Mary, cast in smooth, white concrete, stands watch in many of the small yards in New Orleans East, her arms spread wide, palms out, as if to signal that this is a good spot to stop, to stay. Two, sometimes three to a square block in the neighborhood, the statues are heavy, permanent, and the plain, tiny houses they guard are brick, built to last. The journey to get here was too hard to even think about moving again.</p>
        <p>''We walked through the jungle all day, and spent the next 30 days on the ocean in a small boat,'' said Mary Nguyen, her mind slipping back almost a quarter-century, back to the waves off the coast of Vietnam. ''We stayed in the boat in sunshine, rain, mist. We couldn't move. After a while, we were hungry.</p>
        <p>''My 2-month-old boy had a fever, and I couldn't feed him because I couldn't produce milk for him. I didn't have food to eat myself. He died. I had to put the baby in the ocean. I couldn't leave him in the boat because he would smell. It was the worst day of my life.</p>
        <p>''First, we went to Malaysia. Then, we flew to California. We spent the night there, and the next day we flew to New Orleans. My parents lived there. We haven't lived anywhere else since.''</p>
        <p>Vietnamese, many of whom survived journeys like Ms. Nguyen's,  have been coming to New Orleans for 25 years, resettled here by the Roman Catholic Church after the fall of South Vietnam. More than 10,000 Vietnamese live in the New Orleans East community, a hot, damp and tangled, swampy landscape much like the one they fled -- but, at the same time, as different as the dark side of the moon.</p>
        <p>So, even as they have assimilated here, they also have created a world that sounds and feels like home, from the sweet, dark coffee, swirling with condensed milk, to unofficial community banks that help start businesses, to the open-air market that rings with the Vietnamese language.</p>
        <p>Old women in conical straw hats work fields of greens with hoes and picks, and old men patiently fish the bayou and canals. It is not home, exactly, but there are no killing fields, no state-run apparatus to control thoughts and politics.</p>
        <p>''I left Vietnam because I needed freedom of religion, freedom of speech, because I needed my children to have a future,'' said Ms. Nguyen, who is 41, has seven children, and is a preschool teacher here. ''I like New Orleans. I have a job, a job I like. I have a family. I feel at home here. I can continue my culture here, and not be forced to leave it.''</p>
        <p>Here, the businesses have names like Tran's Automotive, the Kim Anh Recreation Hall, Da Lat Cafe, Hoang-Gia Restaurant, and Nha Thoc Tay Pharmacy, Notary, Insurance and Tax Service.</p>
        <p>Here, the old do not have to adapt if they do not want to, do not have to change language or diet or customs, because much of the life they knew -- the good parts -- has been lifted here, as if in a suitcase.</p>
        <p>They are a people who have earned a little peace.</p>
        <p>Nga Nguyen, a secretary at Mary Queen of Vietnam Church, was about 8 when her family fled Phan Tiet when the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong overran much of South Vietnam.</p>
        <p>''My mother sold everything she had,'' so that the family could eat, Ms. Nguyen recalled.</p>
        <p>They made it to Vung Tau, a coastal town, and the boats were already being pushed out to sea. Mortars thundered in the air. South Vietnamese soldiers ran, stripping off their uniforms and boots.</p>
        <p>There was no room on the boats. But her mother picked her up and threw her into a boat.</p>
        <p>''She told me, 'Stay. They won't throw you off. They won't throw off the children,' '' Ms. Nguyen recalled. And while the grown people on the boat cursed her mother, they did not throw Ms. Nguyen into the sea.</p>
        <p>''And we drifted out, out, and I saw my parents running for the mountains.'' Her aunt, brother and three sisters were on the boat.</p>
        <p>She was taken aboard a United States Navy ship days later -- she cannot recall how long she lay sick in the hold -- and she was resettled in New Mexico in 1975. Two years later, she and her family moved to New Orleans, where a Vietnamese neighborhood was forming.</p>
        <p>She would eventually get a degree in social work from the University of New Orleans. Six years ago, she was able to move her mother and father to New Orleans from Vietnam.</p>
        <p>''It was different for them because when they arrived everything was established,'' she said. ''They just had to register into the community. The loved ones are here.''</p>
        <p>It may seem an odd thing, this enclave of Asian culture that thrives in New Orleans, a city that is considered to be one of the most European cities in America. But it makes perfect sense, say residents here and people who have studied the culture.</p>
        <p>''When the Vietnamese were being resettled in the United States, they were resettled by voluntary agencies,'' said Carl Bankston, a sociologist at Tulane University. ''New Orleans is a very Catholic city. Catholic charities were involved in the resettlement. The fact that Louisiana is a heavily Catholic area was an appeal to heavily Catholic Vietnamese.''</p>
        <p>The church runs strong through their lives, and people here prefer to hear their Mass in Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>''To celebrate Mass in your own language is very important,'' said Nga Nguyen, who is no relation to Mary Nguyen. ''Knowing that someone can live next to you and know your language, and celebrate Mass with you. It's more important than finding a luxury house.''</p>
        <p>Now there are Vietnamese communities not only in New Orleans East but in the Algiers neighborhood, all built around a Catholic church.</p>
        <p>But while the systematic violence of war that chased them here has faded, they have not been immune to  violence in New Orleans East.</p>
        <p>In March 1995, a New Orleans police officer, Antoinette Frank, fatally shot two Vietnamese, and a fellow officer working security at the time, in a New Orleans East restaurant.</p>
        <p>Ms. Frank, who is now on death row, shot Cuong Vu, 17, and his sister, Ha Vu, 24, and Officer Ronald Williams, as she robbed the restaurant.</p>
        <p>Many people here talked about how the killings shook them -- how they believed they had left such things behind. But this is a neighborhood of survivors, Nga Nguyen said.</p>
        <p>''We bury our loved ones, and baptize our new ones,'' she said.</p>
