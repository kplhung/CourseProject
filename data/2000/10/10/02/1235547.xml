        <p>Along a road meandering through the ponderosa pines that blanket the Sacramento Mountains sits a modest trailer. Inside is a small company with big ambitions: Mescalero Apache Telecom Inc.</p>
        <p>The telephone company is the latest effort by the Mescalero Apache Indian tribe to promote economic development on its reservation, which already contains ski slopes, a gambling casino, elk-hunting grounds, a lumber company and a resort with a golf course. Although the 723-square-mile territory in southern New Mexico covers an area more than twice the size of New York City, it has a population of less than 4,000.</p>
        <p>Inside the trailer, Godfrey Enjady, the new company's general manager, spoke optimistically about Mescalero Apache Telecom's plans. He means not only to expand basic telephone service beyond the 40 percent of the tribe's households with phones, but to ring the reservation with a fiber-optic network and introduce high-speed Internet connections.</p>
        <p>''The tribalization of telecommunications goes way beyond dealing blackjack to tourists from Texas,'' said Mr. Enjady, 38. ''This is about creating the infrastructure to attract investment in the same way an emerging market needs to lure foreign capital.''</p>
        <p>By forming a tribally owned and operated telecommunications company, the Mescalero Apaches, who count the legendary warrior Geronimo among their forebears, are not alone. A half-dozen American Indian-owned telephone companies are now in operation on Indian lands. And their numbers are expected to grow, after the Federal Communications Commission's recent decision to add as much as $35 million to the $550 million in federal money already available to companies that expand access to basic phone service on Indian reservations.</p>
        <p>For all the talk of the so-called digital divide in the United States, the least prosperous parts of Indian America find themselves on the wrong side of a more basic chasm: the dial tone divide.</p>
        <p>Only 47 percent of the nation's 720,000 Indian households have plain old telephone service, compared with a nationwide rate of 94 percent, according to the F.C.C. And on some tribal lands, phone service is even rarer. On the Navajo Reservation, the nation's largest Indian territory, encompassing parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, only about one in five households have telephones.</p>
        <p>Because a phone line is needed for Internet access, tribal and federal officials see the wiring of reservations as a basic step to bringing Indians into the New Economy.</p>
        <p>''The Indian people are at the top of the list of groups that are most at risk of being left out of the emerging dot-com economy,'' said William E. Kennard, the chairman of the F.C.C. ''When a tribal government establishes its own telephone company, it is creating an economic development nucleus.''</p>
        <p>Other tribes that are considering forming their own telephone companies include the Navajo Nation and the Hopis of Arizona.</p>
        <p>Under the F.C.C. plan, which will take effect in October, telecommunications companies that provide residential long-distance service throughout the country will be required to pay a small percentage of their revenue to two federal programs meant to reduce the costs of providing local service and of paying the monthly bills for low-income residents of tribal lands.</p>
        <p>Assuming that most carriers will pass this charge on to their customers, the average impact on a monthly $25 long-distance bill would be about 1 cent. The increase would help the programs to make it possible for most phone customers on Indian reservations to get basic local phone service for as little as $1 a month, according to the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>The high cost of providing phone service in sparsely populated expanses has long worked against the people of ''Indian Country,'' as many Indians refer to tribal lands.</p>
        <p>Darrell Gerlaugh, for instance, felt compelled to found Gila River Telecommunications in 1988 in Chandler, Ariz., near Phoenix, after his grandfather fell ill and his uncle had to hitchhike to the nearest telephone to call an ambulance. It took more than two hours for paramedics to arrive -- too late to save his grandfather.</p>
        <p>''It was so expensive to initiate service in far-off areas that the incumbent company ignored us,'' said Mr. Gerlaugh, a member of the Gila River Indian tribe.</p>
        <p>When Gila River Telecommunications began operation, the company's cost for installing phone service was as much as $48,000 per household, and only one in five families had a phone. Now, with the basic network in place -- thanks, in part, to federal subsidies -- the cost of connecting each additional household is minimal. Nearly half the households in Gila River's region now have telephones, according to Belinda Nelson, the company's general manager. The percentage is expected to increase as the additional federal subsidies kick in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerlaugh is president of the National Tribal Telecommunications Alliance, a group formed by the half-dozen tribally controlled telephone companies in existence. Besides Gila River and Mescalero Apache, the alliance includes the nation's oldest tribally owned telephone company, the Cheyenne River Sioux Telephone Authority, established in 1958 in Eagle Butte, S.D. The other members are three Arizona companies: the Tohono O'odham Utility Authority, San Carlos Telecommunications and Fort Mojave Telecommunications.</p>
        <p>The companies are structured in different ways, depending on the needs of each tribe. Mescalero Apache Telecom, serving a particularly entrepreneurial community, is set up as a wholly commercial enterprise. But the others so far are regulated by the tribal governments, which own and operate the companies, with as much of an emphasis on providing basic dial-tone service as on eking out profits. These companies, in particular, will rely on the new form of federal aid to help support their operations.</p>
        <p>Indian household incomes average $30,784, compared with more than $40,000 for white households.</p>
        <p>Although most tribes have significant say over what happens on their lands, the tribal companies are not necessarily exempt from competition. And with the prospect of additional federal subsidies, some tribal phone companies are bracing for new competitors. The F.C.C. has not yet determined whether the new subsidies should be made available to any company -- Indian or not -- that can demonstrate its intention to serve reservations.</p>
        <p>Already, tensions have developed between some executives at tribally controlled phone companies and potential competitors. One visible example involves Western Wireless, of Bellevue, Wash., a commercial company that focuses on providing wireless communications service in rural areas neglected by larger telecommunications companies. Western Wireless has aggressively sought to receive part of the new federal funds.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to get their foot in the door in an underhanded way,'' said J. D. William, general manager of the Cheyenne River Sioux Telephone Authority. ''It's not a level playing field because Western Wireless has deeper pockets and economies of scale we don't have. They're just profiteers, while our purpose goes beyond that.''</p>
        <p>But Western Wireless said it should not be prevented from trying to provide services on tribal lands simply because it was not Indian-owned. The company said it was working with tribes to arrive at the best structures for their needs. It cited a recent agreement with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in Pine Ridge, S.D., in which Western Wireless would eventually turn over control of the operations on tribal lands if the tribe deemed that necessary. Western Wireless apparently sees this concession as a bargaining tool that will help it to pursue similar agreements with other tribes.</p>
        <p>''The tribes who work with us don't have anything to worry about, because we'll turn over control of the operations if that's an option they want,'' said Charles Blackwell, a lawyer and a member of the Chickasaw and Picuris tribes, who is an adviser on Indian issues for Western Wireless.</p>
        <p>He said, though, that Western Wireless hopes the concession will serve primarily as a symbol of good faith. ''There are 82 tribes in our coverage area,'' Mr. Blackwell said. ''If some of those don't want their own phone company, but want service from us, isn't that fair?''</p>
        <p>The F.C.C. appears to think so, although it has not reached a definitive stance on whether to make Western Wireless and other nontribal phone companies eligible for federal money. ''Competition is good for consumers, whether they are in New York or the Navajo Nation,'' said Mr. Kennard, the F.C.C. chairman.</p>
        <p>While these issues are being resolved, the restless energy at the tribally owned companies seeking to increase access to telecommunications among their members is probably best witnessed at Mescalero Apache Telecom, which is run by Mr. Enjady and a work force of four.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the tribe acquired the telecommunications network, including nearly 950 telephone lines, on its land from the GTE Corporation for about $10 million after a lengthy dispute with the company. At one point, the Mescalero Apaches threatened to condemn, or effectively nationalize, GTE's telephone lines. Like other tribes, the Mescalero Apaches have sovereign rule over their lands, permitting them to make such a move.</p>
        <p>The next step was gaining approval to function as a telecommunications company from New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission. While the Mescalero Apaches could have followed the example of some other tribally owned telecommunications companies by self-regulating their phone company, doing so could have threatened the company's eligibility for federal money.</p>
        <p>For the road ahead, Mescalero Apache Telecom is mapping out a future that it hopes will allow it to deliver state-of-the-art services to its clients, who include the 3,600 people on the reservation and people who visit the tourism complexes at the Inn of the Mountain Gods and Casino Apache. The company plans investments of more than $10 million over the next several years, said Mr. Enjady, who was recruited to return to the reservation and run the company after he worked as a technician and manager at GTE.</p>
        <p>By November, the company's customers should receive their first bills with the words ''Mescalero Apache Telecom'' on them. When that happens, the company will find itself in the unusual situation of forming a small telecommunications company when many of the largest companies in the industry are consolidating and creating ever larger conglomerates. So how is a tribally controlled company expected to survive in an age of rampant consolidation?</p>
        <p>''We'll stay lean and mean, offering services that are in demand to our people but weren't available,''  Mr. Enjady said. ''I wouldn't be surprised if we're the ones receiving takeover offers in a few years.''</p>
