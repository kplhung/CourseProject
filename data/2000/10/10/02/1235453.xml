        <p>While there is no shortage of clever columnists writing on professional football, Slate, the online magazine, recently hired one who uses haiku to praise a winning catch and quantum physics terms to describe a quarterback's passing percentage.</p>
        <p>In August, Gregg Easterbrook began writing Slate's Tuesday Morning Quarterback column on the National Football League. Mr. Easterbrook, an author and journalist who writes about public policy and subjects like theology, physics and cosmology, is a senior editor at The New Republic and a contributing editor at The Atlantic Monthly.</p>
        <p>But this is Mr. Easterbrook's first shot at sports. He brings an esoteric humor to a game whose closest brush with the world of physics has been the spiral of a touchdown pass.</p>
        <p>Last week, he applied Newtonian principles to the rise and fall of great football rivalries.</p>
        <p>That San Francisco-Dallas matchups are no longer exciting, he said, ''demonstrates Newton's Third Law of N.F.L. Motion: For every bad team that gets hot, such as the Rams and Ravens, there must be an equal and opposite great team that goes in the tank.''</p>
        <p>He compares the throwing skill of the St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner to a ''neutrino transference array'' and a ''photonic vortex beam generator.''</p>
        <p>''The N.F.L. is a wonderful artificial world and a very entertaining one,'' Mr. Easterbrook said in an interview last week, ''and I wanted to bring the amusement value of the rest of world into a column about it.''</p>
        <p>He prefers to use an ''interdisciplinary approach'' to write about  ''the mad absurdities of the N.F.L.''</p>
        <p>He also makes comparisons to political figures like Joseph Lieberman.</p>
        <p>When prose fails him, Mr. Easterbrook writes in haiku about exciting football moments.</p>
        <p>After the victory by the New York Jets on Sept. 22 over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which the Jets' receiver Wayne Chrebet silenced pregame criticism by Keyshawn Johnson, the Buccaneers' receiver, Mr. Easterbrook wrote:</p>
        <p>Speaks with play not mouth</p>
        <p>Chrebet stands tallest at end</p>
        <p>Keyshawn now looks short.</p>
        <p>Michael Kinsley, editor of Slate, said he had avoided sports coverage, fearing it would not appeal to nonfans.</p>
        <p>''But I like Gregg's pieces, and I'm not interested at all in pro football,'' he said. ''So if he can interest me, he can interest anybody.''</p>
