        <p>The longtime Yankees Paul O'Neill and David Cone shagged fly balls together one sunny morning last March and shared their dreams for the coming season, chatting freely about trying to become the first team in 26 years to win three straight championships.</p>

        <p>The longtime Yankees Paul O'Neill and David Cone shagged fly balls together one sunny morning last March and shared their dreams for the coming season, chatting freely about trying to become the first team in 26 years to win three straight championships.</p>
        <p>O'Neill was reminded of that conversation the other day, in one of the few moments in the last month when some part of his body wasn't covered by an ice pack or a heat pad. ''If you would have written down 10 things that you expected to happen this season, nine of them didn't,'' O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>As recently as three weeks ago, the Yankees were expected to dominate in the postseason. But they collapsed as the regular season closed, clinching a division title only when their rivals also lost. The Yankees dropped their final regular-season game here this afternoon, 7-3, extending their losing streak to seven games -- the longest ever for a team entering the playoffs.</p>
        <p>They lost 15 of their last 18 games -- the worst record in the major leagues since Sept. 13 -- and were often routed. They never had a lead in their final nine road games of the season and were outscored, 94-21, by three teams that won't participate in the playoffs: Toronto, Tampa Bay and Baltimore.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, who finished the year with an 87-74 record, went 13-17 in September. Only three teams in the last 50 years have won the World Series after posting losing records in September. One was the 1974 Oakland Athletics, the last team to win three straight championships.</p>
        <p>''This is different than anything else I've ever had to deal with,'' said Manager Joe Torre, whose team will play the Athletics on Tuesday in the first game of the division series at Oakland. ''It's just weird.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees have a problem, and they know it; the players don't try to pass this off as some unexplainable fluke. They have played terribly. But they appear confident, sure that their wealth of postseason experience and strong starting pitching will come to the fore once the playoffs start.</p>
        <p>''We've been there before, and we know how to win and do the little things in big games,'' catcher Jorge Posada said. ''It's going to seem like a new life once the playoffs start, and we're going to be focused.''</p>
        <p>One player is capable of stopping a slump in baseball, more so than in any other team sport. Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte will start the first games of the playoffs for the Yankees this week, and it won't matter how badly the Yankees played at the end of the regular season if Clemens and Pettitte are effective. In just a matter of hours, the Yankees could transform their current image as aging, fading champions and be in a commanding position in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>It isn't necessary that the Yankees win the first game of the playoffs, according to Torre and some of his players. But they must play well and make sure that their slump does not linger into the start of the postseason.</p>
        <p>''Our intensity has got to be up,'' Posada said. ''We need to pitch well to set the tone, and the offense has got to get out there and score first and get at least one run early.''</p>
        <p>Nothing has come easily this season, unlike the record-setting year of 1998, when the Yankees won 125 games combined in the regular season and postseason. Posada is the Yankees' only everyday player who has had a season free of a serious injury or a deep slump. Cone was expected to win 12 to 15 games, but lost his sharp slider -- perhaps to his age -- and won only four. The Yankees have tried nine different left fielders.</p>
        <p>Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch has been intermittently overwhelmed by throwing jitters. Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius, playing the power positions of first and third base, combined for only 32 home runs, or 18 fewer than Sammy Sosa. With the team struggling to break away from the rest of the division in June, the Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner pushed for change, and the Yankees' midseason additions were probably the most significant in baseball history.</p>
        <p>The Yankees added the All-Stars David Justice and Denny Neagle, along with six other players, and all of them helped; from July 1 to Sept. 13, the Yankees went 45-23, sweeping the Red Sox in Boston in early September and building a nine-game lead. Their pitching staff was rounding into form, and scouts following the Yankees for opposing teams believed they were poised to roll through the postseason again.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees lost to the Blue Jays on Sept. 14, by 3-2 in 11 innings, and they have been reeling since. Their pitchers have an earned run average of 8.03 in the last 18 games. They batted .239 and averaged little more than three runs a game in that span, after averaging .282 and nearly six runs a game. In three successive games in the last week, the Yankees started Neagle, Clemens and Pettitte and were beaten by the unspectacular pitchers Cory Lidle, Bryan Rekar and Chuck McElroy.</p>
        <p>Brosius has not driven home a run since Sept. 10. O'Neill has not had an extra-base hit since Sept. 6. The Yankees' attack has been predicated on a patient approach of waiting for good pitches to hit and drawing walks. Torre agreed that the Yankees' hitters, often facing big deficits early in games during the slump, have been too aggressive.</p>
        <p>Torre's theory about the slump is that after the Yankees swept the Red Sox and established a big lead in the division, they fell into the habit of protecting their advantage, rather than trying to build on it.</p>
        <p>Some players, including Mike Stanton and Posada, believe the Yankees began to coast after the Boston series, their intensity waning. ''I think there was a big exhale once this Boston series was over,'' Stanton said. ''It's like the old parable. You push to row upstream in a river, and you don't stop rowing once you get to where you want. You have to keep pushing, and for a short time, we've stopped rowing.''</p>
        <p>Some players, including O'Neill, Bernie Williams and Justice, have been rested to give nagging injuries time to heal. Unable to get consistent production from a couple of his sluggers, Torre experimented with his lineup, starting Knoblauch at designated hitter to see if there was some other way to use him.</p>
        <p>Toronto crushed the Yankees, 16-3, on Sept. 19, and Torre was furious. He called a team meeting to remind his players that they needed to wrap up the division and prepare for the postseason. At that time, the Yankees seemed assured of having one of the league's two best records and starting the postseason at home.</p>
        <p>But after winning two of three games against Detroit, the Yankees began the losing streak that closed their season. When they came here on Friday, the Yankees were within a couple of games of the greatest collapse in baseball history, but were rescued when second-place Boston lost to Tampa Bay. The Yankees were in the ninth inning of a 13-2 loss to the Orioles Friday when they learned they were American League East champions. It wasn't until Torre told them to celebrate their season-long accomplishment that the players began to relax and open Champagne bottles.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' losing streak was extended when they lost the last two games of the season, but Torre treated the games like exhibitions. He was more concerned about resting regulars and preparing some of his relievers for the playoffs than about trying to rebuild the confidence of his players.</p>
        <p>Torre felt his players' tension relax in the last couple of days. ''There weren't a lot of smiles here for 10 days,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Torre said he expects his players, who have more than 50 World Series rings among them, to rebound once they get a fresh start in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>But he doesn't pretend to know whether his players can recover completely.</p>
        <p>''All of those questions are going to be answered in the next couple of days,'' he said. ''I'm not going to make any predictions, other than to say we're looking toward the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Cone said, ''If we don't play well in the playoffs, everyone will point to this time.''</p>
