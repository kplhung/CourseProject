        <p>After the commercial excesses and failures of technology and transportation in Atlanta, the Sydney Games revived the idea that the Olympics can be organized smoothly on a vast scale and that they remain within the reach of ordinary people.</p>
        <p>The Games of the XXVII Olympiad closed tonight after 16 days of competition during which the late winter weather cooperated with early spring sunshine, hundreds of thousands of spectators were transported daily with minimal inconvenience and 47,000 volunteers greeted those attending the Olympics with unremitting friendliness and humor.</p>
        <p>''I am proud and happy to proclaim that you have presented to the world the best Olympic Games ever,'' said Juan Antonio Samaranch, who participated in his final Games after 20 years as president of the International Olympic Committee. He did not hand out this customary compliment four years ago at the Atlanta Games.</p>
        <p>Nearly two years of scandal resulting from the Salt Lake City bribery case and from organizational problems with the Sydney Games were deflected for a fortnight by a public embrace of swimming, basketball and track and field events. About seven million tickets, a record 90 percent of the total available, were sold for these Olympics. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets daily for the torch relay as the flame made its way toward Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony. No other city could provide a more exquisite backdrop for an international sporting event.</p>
        <p>As the competition concluded, the United States won the medal count with 97 total (39 gold), while Russia continued to maintain its status as an athletic superpower in the wake of the splintering of the former Soviet Union with 88 total medals, 32 of them gold. China finished third in the medal count with 59 medals and 28 gold.</p>
        <p>The British rower Steven Redgrave became the third athlete to win gold medals in five Olympic Games, the two others being Hungarian fencers who started competing in the 1930's. Birgit Fischer, a German kayaker, won two golds in Sydney, giving her a total of seven in five Summer Games. Ethiopians won 8 of the 18 available medals for distance running. With three golds and two bronzes, Marion Jones became the first female athlete to win five medals in track and field in one Olympics.</p>
        <p>Today, Hungary defeated Russia in water polo 44 years after the occupied Hungarians defeated the Soviet Union in a famously contentious match that left blood in the pool.</p>
        <p>The most riveting moment of the Games occurred when Australia's Cathy Freeman ran the women's 400-meter sprint last Monday. As she circled the track, the 112,500 spectators in Olympic Stadium carried her along with flashing cameras and such sustained applause that she had to sit on the track to gather herself after she won the gold medal.</p>
        <p>''I could feel the crowd around me, all over me,'' Freeman said. ''I felt everybody's emotion. Happiness and joy absorbed into every pore of my body. I had to sit down to make myself feel normal and get comfortable. It was beyond words.''</p>
        <p>More than anything, these Games restored a common touch and sense of fun to an Olympic movement viewed by many to have been made inaccessible by an aloof, arrogant leadership. Street parties here were the most vibrant, some said, since the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of Games people grabbed hold of despite the scandals,'' said Richard Cashman, director of the Center for Olympic Studies at New South Wales University. ''The majority still wanted to be involved in these Games, almost in spite of the I.O.C. In turn, the I.O.C. got a little breathing room and relief after the scandals of the last 18 months.''</p>
        <p>Tonight's closing ceremony was a raucous party, evolving into a rock concert performed by Australian bands with international reputations. Australia also displayed one of its most endearing characteristics: its ability to laugh, often at itself.</p>
        <p>Tonight's frivolity included bicycling prawns, drag queens from the movie ''Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' and a riding lawn mower that tried to mulch a dignitary in a spoof that both sent up Australia's suburban dream and symbolized the country's famous antiauthoritarian streak.</p>
        <p>The must-see TV here in Sydney became a wicked nightly satire called ''The Dream,'' which imagined the Chinese synchronized-swimming routine as the story of the Mao's Long March and which featured the unofficial mascot of the Games, a wombat named Fatso.</p>
        <p>The Aborigine Issue</p>
        <p>More serious issues were also given their airing, especially the marginalization of Aborigines. Reconciliation is the most politically and culturally divisive issue in Australia. The indigenous culture was featured prominently in the opening ceremony, and Freeman, the Aboriginal sprinter, lighted the Olympic caldron. Samaranch mentioned the Aborigines in both his opening and closing speeches. Such conspicuous inclusion during the Games deflated a series of planned protests.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the Australian band Midnight Oil sang its protest song ''Beds Are Burning,'' and its members wore shirts and pants printed with the word ''Sorry,'' offering the symbolic apology for the treatment of Aborigines that Prime Minister John Howard has refused to do.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of unfinished business in terms of indigenous people,'' Cashman said. ''I think the Olympics created a positive environment for reconciliation. In some sense, the organizers are ahead of public opinion. Whether any further gains take place, or this was just a feel-good thing, remains to be seen.''</p>
        <p>Despite Sydney's success, the immense size of the Summer Games has left Olympic officials concerned about their manageability in the future. The International Olympic Committee has threatened to remove the 2004 Summer Games from Athens over worries about transportation, security and the Athletes' Village.</p>
        <p>''A friend of mine said that Sydney has raised the bar from a high jump to a pole vault,'' said Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. member from Belgium who coordinated the Sydney Games. ''It was a unique atmosphere. People love sport. They cheered all the athletes. They stayed for the medal ceremonies even if no Australian athletes were involved. The atmosphere of the city itself was incredible. Compared with Atlanta, there were no transportation problems, no technology problems, no overcommercialization. And the home team did splendid. Close to 60 medals for a nation of 19 million -- that is outstanding.''</p>
        <p>Still, Rogge said, it would be short-sighted to declare the Games a success without considering making them smaller.</p>
        <p>''We have to de-scale them, make them affordable to more countries and less rich and sophisticated cities,'' Rogge said.</p>
        <p>He added that it may be time to diminish the number of reporters. There were 21,000 accredited journalists here, two for each of the 10,500 athletes. All told, there were 195,000 people, including athletes, coaches, volunteers and officials, who received credentials for these Games, as against 130,000 at the 1992 Barcelona Games.</p>
        <p>''That is an army that has to be accommodated, fed, transported,'' Rogge said.</p>
        <p>Dealing With Drugs</p>
        <p>The I.O.C. now enters a transition as political jockeying begins for the successor to Samaranch. Rogge, the Belgian surgeon, and Dick Pound, the Montreal attorney, are the favored candidates to become the next president. Whoever wins will face the ominous problem of performance-enhancing drugs, which threaten the legitimacy of every performance at the Winter and Summer Games.</p>
        <p>Before the closing ceremony, two more drug positives were announced, both for the steroid nandrolone, one of which resulted in the stripping of a bronze medal from an Armenian weight lifter. Nandrolone was also the substance for which Marion Jones's husband, the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, tested positive four times this summer.</p>
        <p>Nine athletes tested positive during these Games, and at least 40 failed drug tests before they arrived, including 27 Chinese who withdrew and nine other athletes who were sent home from Sydney. Blood testing for the endurance drug EPO was carried out for the first time at the Sydney Games. The early withdrawals by a number of athletes, along with the fact that no world records were set in track and field, has led some scientists and Olympic officials to conclude that a renewed effort to catch drug cheats has been a deterrent.</p>
        <p>Some have called these Games tainted by drugs, and there can be little doubt now that the use of illicit performance-enhancing substances is pervasive. But a change of attitude appears to have occurred among members of the I.O.C., who no longer seem squeamish about catching cheaters for fear of a loss of public credibility.</p>
        <p>''I think for the first time we're starting to get a handle on this,'' said Pound, who is chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which the I.O.C. created. ''The issue is on the table. Athletes who are cheating are thinking that they might get caught.''</p>
        <p>Pound concedes, however, that much work needs to be done. No tests exist for substances that athletes are believed to be widely using, such as human growth hormone, insulin growth factor and products that serve as artificial blood. The use of genetic engineering to create stronger, faster athletes will begin in the near future, which will make it almost impossible to catch cheaters, some scientists say.</p>
        <p>The American drug-testing system, especially for track and field, has been largely discredited at these Games by I.O.C. officials, who have voiced long-held suspicions that the United States has been covering up positive tests of its athletes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert S. Voy, former medical director of the United States Olympic Committee, seemed to confirm those suspicions in an affidavit first obtained by The Associated Press. The affidavit was submitted in support of Dr. Wade Exum, another former medical chief of the U.S.O.C., who is suing the American Olympic committee.</p>
        <p>Voy's affidavit said he believed that drug use was common among American Olympic-level athletes and that the United States Olympic Committee ''has covered up evidence of American Olympic-level athletes' testing positive for banned performance-enhancing drugs.''</p>
        <p>The committee has denied any wrongdoing. Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic marathon champion, who heads an independent drug-testing agency in the United States, said, ''It's not like the U.S. can't look in the mirror and say, 'There's a problem and we've got to do something about it.'
