        <p>There's talk, talk and more talk about this being the age of artistic collaboration. It's certainly a time when art forms, genres and media technologies cohabit: theater uses film, video and journalism; dance uses narrative and poetry; and fairly new terms like ''performance art'' and ''music-theater piece'' abound, while old terms like ''opera,'' ''musical'' and ''play'' undergo reconstruction.</p>
        <p>Solo performers are now multiple units. Laurie Anderson and Diamanda Galas are musicians, visual artists and orators. Danny Hoch and John Leguizamo are storytellers and actors. Eddie Izzard and Dame Edna Everage (a k a Barry Humphries) are mythic characters and stand-up comedians. Anna Deavere Smith is an oral historian, playwright and actor. Lisa Kron is a memoirist, biographer and performer.</p>

        <p>Solo performers are now multiple units. Laurie Anderson and Diamanda Galas are musicians, visual artists and orators. Danny Hoch and John Leguizamo are storytellers and actors. Eddie Izzard and Dame Edna Everage (a k a Barry Humphries) are mythic characters and stand-up comedians. Anna Deavere Smith is an oral historian, playwright and actor. Lisa Kron is a memoirist, biographer and performer.</p>
        <p>It's awfully hard for one person to do so many things well. And having named a few who succeed brilliantly, I must say that I wish more artists would develop -- or sustain -- their craft by working together. Some might discover it's what they do best. (The Gershwins? Rodgers with Hart, then Hammerstein? Duke Ellington with too many band members to name here?) And how wondrous to find the partner (or partners ) in your work life that we all crave in our private lives. Think of Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev dancing. Think of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, geniuses together in the first days of bop's invention.</p>
        <p>How many singers or performance artists have you seen falter, sink quietly or flail desperately just like all those athletes who outpace themselves or just don't have the technique yet to finish well? (Yes, I've been watching the Olympics obsessively.) How often has a choreographer's work glittered with ideas then turned lusterless, usually a few minutes after intermission?</p>
        <p>Step 1 in collaboration: Join forces with another artist you admire in your field -- another singer, another dancer, another stand-up comic -- and split the bill, doubling your audience and your potential fan base. Step 2: start working together on a piece or pieces. That's how great partnerships and ensembles began.</p>
        <p>When R. H. Harris, the renowned gospel tenor, died last month, I went back to the records he had made in the 1950's with his quartet, the Soul Stirrers. Harris was the -- founder is not too strong a word -- of a soul singing that concentrated on supple phrasing and tonal sweetness. He could, as Tina Turner used to say, ''do it rough,'' but there was a core of reticence, even melancholy in him. His roughness was strategic.</p>
        <p>The Soul Stirrers set the mold for other outstanding quartets like the Swan Silvertones and the Five Blind Boys of Alabama, and for younger soul singers, from Sam Cooke (trained by Harris) to David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations (Harris had mastered husky rhythm singing and falsetto), and Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye.</p>
        <p>Harris would often trade leads with the group's bass-baritone, James H. Medlock. To hear them alternate on the swinging ''I Want to Rest'' is to hear those potent shifts of tone and timbre we expect when a man and woman sing together. And then there's the way they incite each other rhythmically: ''Watch me catch this note faster than you or any beat can,'' he is clearly signaling in the final verse.</p>
        <p>The discipline required of a first-rate ensemble, vocal or instrumental, translates into the kind of musical discretion that comes only from intense on-the-spot listening. Not biding time or doing cute things onstage until your solo comes, but listening. Take melisma (one syllable stretched over many notes), the vocal weapon so battered and abused by pop singers today. Harris was a master of it. For him it was a musical resource, like dynamics or timbre, not a way of muscling listeners to the ground till they screamed and clapped, maybe because they were overpowered, maybe just to stop the madness.</p>
        <p>The Soul Stirrers' a cappella harmonies are deeply satisfying. And when Harris rises above them with his pure, true pitch (pitch is usually the missing element in today's melisma mania), you will experience true bliss.</p>
        <p>There is nothing like watching artists who truly believe that what they do is greater than who they are. I saw that venerable jazz duo Jackie Cain and Roy Kral at the Firebird Cafe in Manhattan last month. They were there for just a few weeks, but I hope they will be induced back for a much longer time. They show that being part of a duo or group can inspire a humility toward one's art that has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with pure pleasure.</p>
        <p>There is nothing remotely pious or solemn about Jackie and Roy. (I'm not being familiar; that's how they are known professionally.) They are airy and off-the-cuff bop-centered musicians with a swing lilt who started singing together in the late 1940's but got their real start in the 50's with Charlie Ventura's band before going out on their own.</p>
        <p>As the pianist and group leader -- it was a trio at the Firebird; it has ranged from a quartet to a quintet through the years -- Mr. Kral sets the pace and takes his solos. As the lead singer Ms. Cain delivers whole songs with perfect intonation and a voice that reminds you of a flute (not twee and frilly, agile and fresh). Mr. Kral often joins her for unison singing, so nice to hear with its well-placed rhythms, cushioned by piano, bass and percussion. And so nice when it alternates with two-part harmonies, some sweet and lovely, some with bop's off-kilter intervals and key changes. At times Ms. Cain sets out alone on one of those buoyant instrumentlike solos known as vocalese; at times she and Mr. Kral, her husband, go forth together.</p>
        <p>They performed songs from 1914, from the 1990's and from many decades between. They did the Gershwins, Frank Loesser and Johnny Burke, as well as two odd, charming songs Mr. Kral wrote with the gifted lyricist Fran Landesman. As singers they are at ease with storytelling and musical abstraction. Mr. Kral is hip-courtly; Ms. Cain is more playful (though never coy) and more direct emotionally, with the music and with us. It is as if she is telling us: ''I know these songs, and I know something about myself. Maybe you'll find some part of yourself here, too.'' I've seen too many singers taint their skill with manners that signal, ''I display my fullest self through these songs, and I know you will find the most desirable expression of your inner self through me.''</p>
        <p>Jackie and Roy's most recent CD, ''By the Beautiful Sea'' (DRG), shows off their charm and versatility. Fortunately their earlier work is being rereleased now, too, on Concord and other labels. You can hear them go from Parker and Gillespie to Alec Wilder.</p>
        <p>R. H. Harris and the Soul Stirrers can also be found on CD, as one of six quartets in a wonderful anthology, ''Kings of the Gospel Highway'' (Shanachie), and by themselves on Specialty collections.</p>
        <p>Every duo, ensemble or company can't last a lifetime. All of them don't need to. But when that meeting of minds, bodies and souls occurs, heaven, however one defines it, feels close at hand.</p>
