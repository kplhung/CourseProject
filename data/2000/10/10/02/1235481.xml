        <p>About two months ago, Oprah Winfrey was summoned to a meeting with the women who had introduced O: The Oprah Magazine to the world -- Ellen Levine, editor in chief of Good Housekeeping, and Cathleen P. Black, chief executive of Hearst Magazines. They had some news for her: of all copies of Ms. Winfrey's new magazine placed on newsstands around the country, 75 percent had been sold.</p>
        <p>On hearing the figure, Ms. Winfrey's hands fluttered to her throat in a gesture of mock suicide.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'Seventy-five percent?' '' Ms. Winfrey said in an interview last week. ''We haven't sold all of them? That doesn't sound like we're kicking it, if you know what I mean.''</p>
        <p>But, in fact, in an industry where obscenely successful magazines sell 50 percent of the copies offered on the newsstand, 75 percent is a figure almost without precedent. And the first and second issues of O, in fact, eventually sold out.</p>
        <p>Ms. Winfrey is apparently kicking it just fine. After four issues, O: The Oprah Magazine -- buoyed by its famous editor's pop-cultural omnipresence, the magazine's ample opportunities for promotion and the soothing message that it is O.K. to be zaftig, divorced and maybe even broke -- is now considered by many magazine executives and advertisers to be the most successful new magazine in decades.</p>
        <p>The essays and articles about ''real stuff,'' in Ms. Winfrey's words, have made it a warts-and-all look at American womanhood. It is a magazine as much about reality as a glossy magazine can be, much as the CBS series ''Survivor'' purported to peer into the imperfect psyches of strangers. O is reality television, on sale at the newsstand. It is also Ms. Winfrey's talk show in print, an Oprah bible for her millions of fans.</p>
        <p>Despite some start-up troubles -- vagaries like staffing problems that bedevil all new publications, as well as other issues -- O. appears to be so healthy that exceedingly sober industry observers sound almost giddy when they discuss it. (Another testament to the magazine's success is that no one in the industry makes ''The Story of O'' jokes anymore.) David Verklin, the chief executive of Carat North America, a media-services company, said he had never seen anything like it.</p>
        <p>''I cannot recollect in my 25 years in the advertising business a magazine growing this big, this quickly and having this much consumer demand,'' he said. ''It is an unusual situation.''</p>
        <p>After two issues, newsstand sales averaged 1.5 million copies, according to Hearst -- more than the average newsstand sales of Vogue, Self and Martha Stewart Living combined. (The numbers for O are not yet audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the industry's monitor.) After just four issues, O already has more than a million subscribers, Hearst says, which is appreciably more than long-established magazines like Vogue (681,000, according to the Audit Bureau) and Self (786,000) and even more than the relatively recent upstart In Style (646,000).</p>
        <p>And 210,000 of those subscribers came in through Oprah.com, making the Web site probably the most successful example so far of a closely watched source of magazine subscriptions -- the Internet magnet for subscribers.</p>
        <p>But it still remains to be seen how long people will keep reading after being drawn to the magazine by Ms. Winfrey's enormous name recognition and her ability to prompt an almost Pavlovian response in consumers. Samir Husni, a professor of media studies at the University of Mississippi, said he had recently overheard a debate at a meeting of newsstand executives. ''They were saying, 'Where do we put O? Do we put it with the fashion magazines? Do we put it with the women's magazines?' I told them you could put it with the tattoo magazines and it would still sell.''</p>
        <p>The editorial mix is unlike that of most women's magazines. While Martha Stewart Living's October cover touts an article about how to carve pumpkin chandeliers, Self is praising thin thighs and Marie Claire is screaming ''Men Confess: What Makes A Woman Irresistible,'' O sounds more like Obi-Wan Kenobi, gently suggesting ''Trust Yourself: The Truth Is In There.''</p>
        <p>To that end, there are articles about how to recover after your husband walks out, how to diagnose your own depression and how a homeless woman became a chief executive, and interviews with celebrities like Sidney Poitier, Martha Stewart and Jane Fonda -- each revealing some vulnerable part of themselves to Ms. Winfrey. (Ms. Stewart admitted that she cries every day.)</p>
        <p>There are no articles about plastic surgery or Botox injections, no lists of the top 10 ways to get your man to declare his love, and no articles with titles like ''50 Orgasms a Minute.''</p>
        <p>''I am interested in helping women create intimacy in their lives and in their relationships,'' Ms. Winfrey said. ''And once you've reached a certain level of maturity, whether you're 28 or 48, you understand that 50 orgasms a minute does not exist.''</p>
        <p>Some editors believe O's success is due solely to Ms. Winfrey's popularity, that you could slap her picture on a blank book and it would still fly off supermarket shelves. ''The No. 1, incontrovertible reason for the magazine's success is Oprah herself,'' Cynthia Leive, editor in chief of Self magazine, said. ''Her popularity cannot be underestimated.''</p>
        <p>Others credit it to the fact that Ms. Winfrey, who is actively involved at every level of editing, has no magazine experience. Jane Pratt, the editor of another eponymous magazine, Jane, and a former talk show host herself, said that gives Ms. Winfrey a fresh perspective.</p>
        <p>''When someone comes from another form of media, they bring things with them that career-long magazine editors do not think of,'' Ms. Pratt said. ''She brought humanity to cover lines, for example. She will never do 'Five Ways to Be Fit by Tomorrow' because she sees that as an oversimplification and her audience does not respond well to that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Winfrey herself said she did not know if her lack of magazine experience was helpful. ''I think it might be irritating,'' she said. ''Because I'm like, 'Why can't we have these spreads right at the front?' But I do think we have an opportunity to break the mold.''</p>
        <p>Her lack of experience has doubtless been frustrating at times to executives at Hearst, where Ms. Winfrey has emerged as a sort of Eloise figure: like the fictional little girl living in the Plaza Hotel, she can roam the hallways demanding what she wants, and some responsible adult will see that she gets it. And there have been trouble spots at O since its first days. For starters, Ms. Winfrey was outspoken about disliking the first two issues.</p>
        <p>''I said it would get better and it did,'' Ms. Winfrey said. ''It is pretty good now, and I would not have said that three months ago.''</p>
        <p>Her dissatisfaction led to the departure of the magazine's first editor, Ellen Kunes. The magazine's publisher, Alyce Alston, resigned before the third issue arrived on newsstands. The new editor, Amy Gross, is ''seasoned,'' Ms. Winfrey said. (Ms. Gross, a former editor in chief of Mirabella, is also in tune with the magazine's quasispiritual self-help message: she has spent six months out of the last two years at a Buddhist retreat that allows no talking.)</p>
        <p>And on the business side, Hearst executives were exceedingly cautious in their expectations, which in hindsight makes them look a bit unwise. One media buyer for a major automobile manufacturer, who asked not to be named, said that when he was first asked to consider advertising in the magazine his reaction was that Hearst had grossly underestimated the first rate base -- the circulation guaranteed to advertisers.</p>
        <p>Hearst executives established the rate base at 500,000 for the first issue. Eventually, 1.6 million copies were printed and distributed. The rate base was raised to 900,000 with the September issue, and now it is 1.3 million. Hearst executives said the rate base will be raised to 1.6 million, and perhaps even more, in 2001.</p>
        <p>But the imbalance caused by the magazine's popularity has in turn caused a curious situation for Hearst: advertisers are paying, for example, $32,000 a page for a rate base of 500,000, when they should be paying closer to $100,000 a page.</p>
        <p>It is not considered a good idea to give advertisers a bonus circulation over rate base, said several advertisers. Gene DeWitt, chief executive of Optimedia International U.S., an advertising services agency in New York, said: ''You are paying to print those copies and you are not getting any revenue based on them.'' It is, in essence, money that Hearst should be earning flowing out of Hearst's pocket. (Jill Seelig, O's publisher, could not say how many advertisers had signed on to long-term advertising schedules from the outset, but she recently announced a plan that will encourage long-term schedules for advertisers.)</p>
        <p>In many ways, the rate base policy  reflects the cautious nature of Hearst Magazines. Ms. Black, the Hearst Magazines chief executive, said there was no way to have estimated the magazine's success. ''It is much better to be conservative than overpromise,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Winfrey still sounds skeptical. ''I do not think anybody really had any idea of how the Oprah brand -- the most overused word of our times, excuse me -- would translate and transfer itself into print,'' she said. ''But I remember sitting in those first early meetings and one of the first things they were telling me was, 'We are sticking with 500,000, we are not going back to reprint, that is the first thing we will not be doing.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Black said: ''The only question was whether or not we were going to go back on press. We would rather have sold out than go back on press and end up with half a million unsold copies.''</p>
        <p>And Ms. Winfrey is also ready to change the price of the magazine, which Hearst is selling $2.95 -- the kind of low price that could attract less august advertisers and alter the tone of the magazine.</p>
        <p>''I have been telling them from the beginning, it could have been $3.50,'' Ms. Winfrey said. Then she lowered her voice and, through what sounded like theatrically gritted teeth, said: ''But they have to test-market and see for themselves. I am feeling $3.50, folks! I mean, $2.95! You can't get anything for $2.95!'' (Ms. Black said, ''Well, I would anticipate that the price will be going up.'')</p>
        <p>Industry observers say the price could be raised and that O could even be published more frequently. Mr. Husni said that it could easily be published twice a month and reach the same levels of circulation.</p>
        <p>''Oprah is a drug for millions of women,'' he said. ''They need to be reassured, and told that everything is O.K. She does that, and if she does it once a month, she can do it twice a month, and the women will still come running. And Hearst needs to keep praying and lighting candles that the good Lord will add years and years to Oprah's life.''</p>
