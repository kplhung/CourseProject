        <p>Sure, Common Quest magazine was never going to outsell The New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Since it was founded in 1995, Common Quest -- which is subtitled The Magazine of Black Jewish Relations -- never reached more than a circulation of 20,000. But, appearing at a time when Jewish and black relations appeared to be at a low point, it was provocative and also had a certain tongue-in-cheek humor: one cover story about blacks and Jews who worked together to create the R &amp; B industry was titled ''Rhythm and Jews.''</p>
        <p>From the start, Common Quest was supported in large part by the American Jewish Committee. Last week, to the chagrin of Common Quest's editors, the committee said it would pull its support.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Rieder, a professor at Barnard and one of two co-editors, said the American Jewish Committee ''has decided to not explore whether funding can be raised for the magazine, and I am sort of mystified by that.'' Mr. Rieder said the magazine was just coming into its own and had begun to explore issues of race beyond just black and Jewish relations.</p>
        <p>Ralph E. Grunewald, the assistant executive director of the committee, said it was exploring other ways to address the issue of relations between blacks and Jews. ''For now, we want to step back and decide how best to accomplish our mandate,'' he said, adding that a new strategy might include conferences, monographs, a newsletter, a Web site and perhaps even a magazine further down the road.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Russell L. Adams, chairman of the department of Afro-American studies at Howard University and Common Quest's other co-editor, said a Web site might not accomplish as much as a printed magazine.</p>
        <p>''A lot of Afro-American readers are not folks with computers necessarily, even though the magazine was written at a fairly high literary level,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rieder expressed disappointment that the American Jewish Committee could not raise more money for the magazine. ''We were very bare-bones,'' he said. ''I was sending out letters to my mother saying, 'Mom, please renew your subscription! Send me $15! Keep us going!' ''</p>
