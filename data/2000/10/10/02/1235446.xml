        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 28 letter writer makes the argument that ''virtually all Americans without some form of insurance have access to some level of care in emergency rooms.'' But many studies have shown that lack of health insurance leads to poorer health even if emergency care is available.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A Sept. 28 letter writer makes the argument that ''virtually all Americans without some form of insurance have access to some level of care in emergency rooms.'' But many studies have shown that lack of health insurance leads to poorer health even if emergency care is available.</p>
        <p>Uninsured Americans are up to three times more likely than insured people to experience adverse health outcomes and have been found to be up to four times as likely to require avoidable hospitalizations and emergency hospital care, both of which add to the country's health care costs.</p>
        <p>Uninsured patients have a generally higher mortality rate than those with insurance. The data were reviewed in the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine report ''No Health Insurance? It's Enough to Make You Sick.''</p>
