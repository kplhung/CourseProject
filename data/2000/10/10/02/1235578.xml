        <p>Article compares Aleksandr Karelin, Russian Greco-Roman wrestler who had not lost match since 1987, to wrestlers of ancient games who had similar winning streaks until younger competitors wore them down; Karelin lost to Rulon Gardner of United States; photo (S)</p>

        <p>When Aleksandr Karelin lost his bid for his fourth consecutive gold medal, it was a struggle for commentators to resist hyperbole. When describing Karelins dominating career, the phrase best wrestler of all time was mentioned repeatedly. After all, Karelin had not lost a single Greco- Roman match since 1987, winning nine world championships to go along with his three Olympic golds. But this is not baseball or football. In wrestling, all time goes back a long way.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, Karelin's dominance is more in line with that of Sostartos, who also won three straight Olympics in pankration (an ancient form of wrestling). His reign lasted from 364 B.C. to 356 B.C. And, like Karelin -- who is often called the World's Meanest Man -- Sostartos struck fear into his opponents. Karelin's signature move, the reverse body lift, terrified his challengers, whom he flipped in the air and slammed on their backs. Sostartos had a nasty -- but legal -- habit of breaking his opponents fingertips. That habit has earned him the nickname Mr. Fingertips.</p>

        <p>When Aleksandr Karelin lost his bid for his fourth consecutive gold medal, it was a struggle for commentators to resist hyperbole. When describing Karelins dominating career, the phrase best wrestler of all time was mentioned repeatedly. After all, Karelin had not lost a single Greco- Roman match since 1987, winning nine world championships to go along with his three Olympic golds. But this is not baseball or football. In wrestling, all time goes back a long way.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, Karelin's dominance is more in line with that of Sostartos, who also won three straight Olympics in pankration (an ancient form of wrestling). His reign lasted from 364 B.C. to 356 B.C. And, like Karelin -- who is often called the World's Meanest Man -- Sostartos struck fear into his opponents. Karelin's signature move, the reverse body lift, terrified his challengers, whom he flipped in the air and slammed on their backs. Sostartos had a nasty -- but legal -- habit of breaking his opponents fingertips. That habit has earned him the nickname Mr. Fingertips.</p>
        <p>But neither could stand the test of time like Milo of Kroton, who is, dare it be said, the best wrestler of all time. According to Tufts University's Perseus Project Digital Library, he first won in boys'wrestling in 540 B.C. Eight years later, he returned to win the first of five consecutive wrestling Olympic laurels (no gold medals back then).</p>
        <p>And, like Karelin, Milo was a man with uncommon strength whose winning streak came to a similar end. Neither was overpowered by his conqueror. Rather the aging combatants were worn down by younger competitors, who simply warded them off or avoided them.</p>
