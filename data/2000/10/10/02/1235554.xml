        <p>Re ''Better Care in Nursing Homes'' (editorial, Sept. 25):</p>
        <p>Your editorial is in the camp of supply-side approaches to improving care through more and better trained health care workers. I would like to suggest that a demand-side approach be included: namely, a combination of more and better trained workers along with a self-help emphasis among staff and patients.</p>

        <p>Re ''Better Care in Nursing Homes'' (editorial, Sept. 25):</p>
        <p>Your editorial is in the camp of supply-side approaches to improving care through more and better trained health care workers. I would like to suggest that a demand-side approach be included: namely, a combination of more and better trained workers along with a self-help emphasis among staff and patients.</p>
        <p>Demand-side strategies would include a role for the residents of nursing homes, including participation in self-help groups.</p>
        <p>At present, nursing home residents are demoralized and conditioned by a trained incapacity to help themselves. This needs to turn around, and increasing the supply of professionals, though important, will not help empower residents in this way.</p>
        <p>FRANK RIESSMAN  New York, Sept. 25, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer, a nursing home resident, contributes to selfhelpweb.org, the National Self-Help Clearinghouse.</p>
