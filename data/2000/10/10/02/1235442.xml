        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read your Sept. 26 note ''From the Editors'' about the Wen Ho Lee case and noticed that those in charge were willing to accept responsibility for the coverage. This is remarkable. But the editors are too modest when  explaining the reasons for lapses in coverage and the impact of the coverage. The lapses in coverage were due to a failure to look for opposing views.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read your Sept. 26 note ''From the Editors'' about the Wen Ho Lee case and noticed that those in charge were willing to accept responsibility for the coverage. This is remarkable. But the editors are too modest when  explaining the reasons for lapses in coverage and the impact of the coverage. The lapses in coverage were due to a failure to look for opposing views. Let me give you one example.</p>
        <p>Your March 6, 1999, article described the national laboratories as irresponsible about security efforts. The following is stated as fact, not someone's opinion: ''The labs had long resisted F.B.I. and Congressional pressure to tighten their security policies.''</p>
        <p>Yet, in fact, the labs were leaders in improving security in the Energy Department. Donald M. Kerr, the Los Alamos director, asked me to help him set up a counterintelligence program in 1983. Livermore took similar actions at about the same time.</p>
        <p>The March 6 article contributed to the public perceptions that scientists at the national labs do not take security seriously. Based on my 20-year experience at Los Alamos, this is not accurate.</p>
