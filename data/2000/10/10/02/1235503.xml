        <p>Pope John Paul II today canonized 120 Roman Catholics killed in China although the Chinese government had condemned the action as an insulting reminder of colonial imperialism.</p>
        <p>The 120 canonizations and those of three other women, including Mother Katharine Drexel, a turn-of-the-century American philanthropist, underlined the complex geopolitics that vein the Vatican's spiritual mission.</p>
        <p>China had no saints before today. By canonizing as martyrs 87 Chinese believers and 33 European missionaries killed between 1648 and 1930, John Paul sought to send a strong signal to China's beleaguered underground Catholics, who are loyal to the pope. But he risked the wrath of the Chinese government, with which the Vatican badly wants to revive diplomatic relations.</p>
        <p>And by making a saint of the Philadelphia heiress who became a nun and spent her fortune to found schools for American Indians and poor blacks, the pope not only honored Mother Drexel's social conscience, but also recognized the influence of American Catholics, who raise more money for the Vatican than Catholics in any other country.</p>
        <p>Mother Drexel, who died in 1955, is only the second saint born in the United States. The first was Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was canonized in 1975. ''Katharine Drexel is an excellent example of that practical charity and generous solidarity with the less fortunate, which has long been the distinguishing mark of American Catholics,'' the pope said in his homily.</p>
        <p>The 80-year-old pope has created 447 saints, more than all of his predecessors in the last 500 years combined, retuning the process to raise the profile of the church in some countries and to create new role models for today's believers.</p>
        <p>Today, he also canonized Josephine Baktira, a former slave from Sudan, the first African saint not canonized as a martyr, and Maria Josefina, a Spanish nun who, like Katharine Drexel, founded a religious order.</p>
        <p>Vatican saint-making sometimes carries contentious political undertones, as became evident at the recent beatification of Pius IX, which was fiercely protested by Italian Jewish groups that view the 19th-century pope as anti-Semitic.</p>
        <p>The creation of Chinese martyred saints, intended as an inspiration for what the Vatican estimates are eight million Chinese Catholics loyal to the pope, inevitably angered the Communist government. China appoints bishops in a state-controlled ''patriotic'' Catholic church and fears that the underground church loyal to Rome undermines its authority.</p>
        <p>Chinese leaders had fiercely denounced the plan to hold today's ceremony on the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. In Beijing today, leaders of China's state-run church sided with the authorities. ''Today is National Day, and more than ever Chinese Catholics should stand with the nation,'' Bishop Fu Tieshan told worshipers at South Cathedral.</p>
        <p>In St. Peter's Square, under drizzling rain, tens of thousands of people gathered, including large delegations of ethnic Chinese Catholics from Taiwan, Hong Kong and elsewhere, who sang and prayed in Chinese.</p>
        <p>In its list of martyrs, the Vatican did not include any Catholics killed under Communist rule. That, however, did not assuage the Chinese government, which today denounced the chosen missionaries and Chinese martyrs as ''evil-doing sinners.'' Most of the 120 martyrs died in the anti-Western, anti-Christian Boxer Rebellion in the 19th century, which China still reveres as an heroic resistance to imperialists.</p>
        <p>John Paul alluded to China's interpretation of the role of missionaries in Chinese colonial history. ''This celebration is not the opportune moment to make judgments on those periods of history,'' he said. ''It can and should be done in another forum.  Today, with this solemn proclamation of sainthood, the church intends only to recognize that these matryrs are an example of courage and consistency for all of us and an honor to the noble Chinese people.''</p>
        <p>China broke diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1951. The Vatican, which has already signaled its willingness to move its embassy from Taiwan to Beijing in exchange for diplomatic relations, wants to increase religious freedom for Catholics loyal to the pope, who are often persecuted. When Zeng Jingmu, an 81-year-old bishop appointed by Rome, was reportedly arrested last month, the initial Vatican reaction was muted. A top Vatican official, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, was at the time on a rare public visit to  Beijing to attend a conference.</p>
        <p>Upon his return to Rome last week, the cardinal finally voiced the church's concern, telling reporters that he had ''protested energetically against a new wave of arrests of the faithful, even of bishops, which took place when I was in China.''</p>
        <p>Vatican officials last week indignantly challenged the Chinese government's characterization of the missionaries as ''a one-sided reading of history.'' The awkward timing of the canonizations, however, was more likely a blunder by Vatican officials than an intentional provocation. After the date was announced, Vatican officials insisted that Oct. 1 had been chosen because it is the feast day of St. Theresa of Lisieux, patron of missions.</p>
        <p>After the ceremony, the pope addressed another diplomatic issue roiling the Vatican, defending a recent document that upheld the primacy of the Catholic Church as a road to salvation. The document offended leaders of other faiths, who saw it as a step back in ecumenical and interfaith dialogue.</p>
        <p>John Paul told believers that the document was ''close to my heart'' but that it had received ''many erroneous interpretations.'' The pope said it was not a statement of ''arrogance to disparage other religions,'' but an effort to clarify the foundations of Catholic teaching. ''A dialogue without foundations is destined to degenerate into empty words,'' he said.</p>
