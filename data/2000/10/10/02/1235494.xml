        <p>ALITTLE less than 24 hours after winning her fifth and final Olympic medal, Marion Jones was still searching for the word to describe a feeling of emptiness.</p>
        <p>Jones came to these Olympics amid great fanfare. Her goal was to become the first woman in track in field to win five gold medals in one Olympics. Her events: 100 meters, 200 meters, the long jump, the 4x100 relay, the 4x400 relay. The result: gold medals in the 100, the 200 and the 4x400 relay; bronze medals in the long jump and 4x100 relay.</p>

        <p>ALITTLE less than 24 hours after winning her fifth and final Olympic medal, Marion Jones was still searching for the word to describe a feeling of emptiness.</p>
        <p>Jones came to these Olympics amid great fanfare. Her goal was to become the first woman in track in field to win five gold medals in one Olympics. Her events: 100 meters, 200 meters, the long jump, the 4x100 relay, the 4x400 relay. The result: gold medals in the 100, the 200 and the 4x400 relay; bronze medals in the long jump and 4x100 relay.</p>
        <p>Disappointed? No. How can you be disappointed in winning five Olympic medals?</p>
        <p>Sad? Not really. How can you be sad when three of those medals were gold?</p>
        <p>But Jones wanted it all.</p>
        <p>''There's something still out there,'' she said. ''That gold medal was still for the taking in the long jump and in the relays.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''Something just wasn't there on those days, that's unfortunate, and I'm a little bit saddened by that. But looking at the whole gamut of things, over all it was a very successful Sydney Games for me.''</p>
        <p>Jones was here to have lunch with Mya Thompson, an 11-year-old Make-a-Wish recipient from Ithaca, N.Y., whose request was to meet Jones. Thompson is a leukemia patient.</p>
        <p>Jones said she felt most ecstatic about her first and last events, the 100 and the 4x400 relay; the 100 because it was her first gold and the relay because it was her best performance of the Olympics. Her 400 leg underlined her value to the team.</p>
        <p>She had just run the 4x100 and was smoldering over the third- place finish caused by poor baton handling.</p>
        <p>''After that 4x100 I was a little upset; I thought it was a good opportunity to pick up gold No. 3, so from the stadium to the warm-up track I did a lot of soul-searching, asking myself, 'O.K., Marion. Are you going to be ready for this 4x4?' But as soon as I walked out to the warm-up track and saw my teammates and everybody, and that they were relying on me, I was like 'I got to do it.' ''</p>
        <p>But the greatest body blow was the disclosure that her husband, the shot-putter C. J. Hunter had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. She implied that this was only the beginning of a fight. Hunter said when the Games are over, the walls are coming down on the powers that be.</p>
        <p>''Apart from C. J. being an athlete, he's my husband, I support him,'' Jones said. ''I think he's a clean athlete and that there's an injustice that's been done against him. We have a very heavy support system. In the next coming weeks, or months or however long it will take, C. J.'s name will be cleared.''</p>
        <p>She added that the timing was not only unfortunate but suspicious. ''I definitely think it was planned. Something like this doesn't just come out.''</p>
        <p>Regarding the news conference she and Hunter held about his tests, she added: ''I was at the brink when I made my statement. I was very emotional at that point. I had a conversation with several family members, my coach, with C. J., and we decided that they were going to make a circle around me, and kind of embrace me and support me, and make positive energy flow my way.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday Michael Johnson paid Jones a supreme compliment. Johnson said he was at ease if the future of the United States track and field were in Jones's hands.</p>
        <p>''It's my first Olympic Games, I'm 24 years old, compared to the other members of the track and field team, I'm pretty much a newcomer.</p>
        <p>''To have somebody like Michael Johnson say something like that about you says a lot about my character, that I'm more than a track-and-field athlete.''</p>
        <p>While Jones accepted the compliment from Johnson, she did not accept his view of the brash celebration by the men's 4x100 relay team. She said she was not angry or ashamed.</p>
        <p>''Although their style's a little more flamboyant than others, that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong,'' she said. ''Everybody is different. If you have one way of celebrating, have a good time, enjoy it. You've worked hard for it.''</p>
        <p>During a news conference last night, the Bahamas sprinter Pauline Davis-Thompson said the Caribbean female athletes were only now entering an era of liberation she felt the United States athletes have already enjoyed.</p>
        <p>Chamique Holdsclaw, the basketball superstar who turned 23 last week, is part of a fabulous new generation of female athletes in the United States.</p>
        <p>Venus Williams, who turned 20 in June, grew in stature at these Games before our eyes, with a gold medal in singles and doubles.</p>
        <p>Marion Jones will be 25 this month.</p>
        <p>''Well, I think in terms of American women having an avenue and an open avenue for free speech,'' she said, ''and to say whatever we want whenever we want, to look however we want, to be able to show our personalities, as different as they might be, I think that's definitely a surge in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>Jones was still wrestling with her Olympic performance, disappointed on one hand but satisfied that she had achieved what very few athletes ever will.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people said I couldn't win five gold medals,'' she said. ''O.K., I didn't do that, but a lot of people would have never picked me to win five medals at all.''</p>
