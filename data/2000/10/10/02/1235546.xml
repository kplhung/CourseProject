        <p>ONLY a month ago, the chance of a Subway Series seemed feasible. Now that chance seems feeble.</p>
        <p>Only a month ago the Yankees were cruising and the Mets were ensconced in first place, however briefly. But now it's as if the Yankees are stricken with amnesia, as if they have forgotten how to hit or pitch or even pick up a ground ball. And even though the Mets have won 9 of their last 11 games, they could not beat the Atlanta Braves when they had to.</p>
        <p>About the only way the Yankees will get to the World Series is if they are mercifully granted a bye through the American League playoffs.</p>
        <p>As for the Mets, even if they get past the San Francisco Giants, they have to hope that the St. Louis Cardinals knock out the Braves.</p>
        <p>In losing 15 of their last 18 games (and seven in a row), the Yankees have also lost their mystique as the two-time reigning World Series champions. When their division series opens tomorrow in Oakland, the Athletics will know that the Yankees are more vulnerable than ever before during Joe Torre's five-year tenure as manager.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's going to affect Tuesday,'' Torre said yesterday, referring to tomorrow's series opener. ''I'm confident going into Tuesday, it's all new.''</p>
        <p>Such bravado is typical of any manager with a supposedly good team that is in a slump, especially a supposedly good team that is entering the playoffs. Torre has to sound confident; anything less would erode whatever confidence his players still retain after suffering through their horrendous and embarrassing slump.</p>
        <p>''But everything,'' Torre added, ''is going to be based on pitching.''</p>
        <p>In the postseason, everything always is based on pitching. And the proof of the Yankees' vulnerability is Torre's pitching plans. If there are fourth and fifth games in the division series, he will use his Game 1 and Game 2 starters, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte, after only three days' rest instead of their usual four days' rest.</p>
        <p>Having to use his two best starters on only three days' rest is a sign of Torre's desperation, if not panic. In mapping his starters in previous series, Torre always had a dependable fourth starter available. This time he obviously distrusts his fourth starter, Denny Neagle, who has been demoted to the bullpen, at least for now. David Cone, the Yankees' big-game starter in other years, is now their most unreliable pitcher; he has a 4-14 record with a 6.91 earned run average. To use him in relief with a game at stake would be Torre's biggest gamble.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' bullpen is also more vulnerable than in the past. Their setup relievers, Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton, have been inconsistent. Their closer, Mariano Rivera, who was virtually unhittable a year ago, is not that dominant now. And without the ailing Ramiro Mendoza available for long relief, Torre must look to Dwight Gooden, Neagle or Cone.</p>
        <p>The Mets now have a dominant closer in Armando Benitez, but so do the Giants in Robb Nen. This National League division series might evolve into which team is ahead after eight innings, maybe even after six. But the Giants' hitters have had problems against left-handed pitchers and the Mets will open with two of baseball's best, Mike Hampton and Al Leiter.</p>
        <p>For the Mets to get past the Giants, they also need Mike Piazza to hit as he did in July when he was the leading candidate for the Most Valuable Player award, which now is expected to go to Barry Bonds of the Giants.</p>
        <p>If the Mets and Braves advance to the N.L. Championship Series, the Mets will need to find a way to beat the Braves when it counts. They lost the first two games of their mid-September showdown in Atlanta, then watched the Braves clinch the N.L. East last Tuesday night at Shea when the Mets still had a mathematical chance to overtake the Braves.</p>
        <p>At least the Mets won't be playing under the severe ownership pressure that is hanging over the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Even if the Mets go out quietly, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday won't rant and rave. But unless the Yankees somehow regroup to win the World Series, you can expect George Steinbrenner to explode. He's been quiet throughout Torre's tenure, but that's because he never had much to complain about; the Yankees won the Series in three of the four years.</p>
        <p>The hunch here is that the Giants will win the World Series for the first time in San Francisco (after losing to the Yankees in 1962 and to Oakland in 1989). It would also be the first time in the franchise's history since 1954, when their New York ancestors swept the Cleveland Indians, who had won 111 games during the regular season.</p>
        <p>There's a better chance for another Bay Bridge Series between San Francisco and Oakland than there is for a Subway Series. Only a month ago, a Subway Series was feasible. But if a Subway Series develops now, you'll need more than a token. You'll need a miracle.</p>
