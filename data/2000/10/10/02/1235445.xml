        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have been teaching since 1975, and I read with great interest about Donna Moffett, a 45-year-old first-year teacher in Brooklyn (front page, Sept. 28). Ms. Moffett and her colleagues may lack formal education training, but they have the desire to teach. Just as those who really want to learn make the best students, so it goes for those who teach.</p>

        <p>I have been teaching since 1975, and I read with great interest about Donna Moffett, a 45-year-old first-year teacher in Brooklyn (front page, Sept. 28). Ms. Moffett and her colleagues may lack formal education training, but they have the desire to teach. Just as those who really want to learn make the best students, so it goes for those who teach.</p>
        <p>I know that my education courses in college did little to prepare me for the classroom. I learned, and continue to learn, by listening to my students and working hard. The job of teaching means that we must take children seriously and help them learn to hold themselves accountable for how they seek to understand the world. It's a wonderful profession, and I welcome Ms. Moffett and her colleagues to our ranks.</p>
