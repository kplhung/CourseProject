        <p>Fresh Fighting, and Rage, In Palestinian Protests  Nine more Palestinians were reported dead, bringing the Arab death toll to 28, and the first Israeli casualty was reported as Palestinian rioting spread beyond the West Bank and Gaza into Arab towns inside Israel's borders. An Israeli-Palestinian agreement to restrain the fighting disintegrated, and Palestinian funerals fed the rage that propelled fresh protests, countered at times by heavy-duty Israeli weapons.</p>

        <p>Fresh Fighting, and Rage, In Palestinian Protests  Nine more Palestinians were reported dead, bringing the Arab death toll to 28, and the first Israeli casualty was reported as Palestinian rioting spread beyond the West Bank and Gaza into Arab towns inside Israel's borders. An Israeli-Palestinian agreement to restrain the fighting disintegrated, and Palestinian funerals fed the rage that propelled fresh protests, countered at times by heavy-duty Israeli weapons.</p>

        <p>A scene of violence in Gaza that ended in the deaths of a 12-year-old boy and the ambulance driver trying to come to his aid has become a potent new symbol of what angry Palestinians contend is their continued victimization by Israeli occupiers.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>The prospect of President Clinton brokering an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before he leaves office has all but evaporated with the outbreak of violence, diplomats and analysts said.</p>

        <p>Lawsuit Cites War-Era Slavery  Thousands of Chinese men who served as forced laborers for Japanese companies during World War II have filed a landmark lawsuit. A 1999 California law allows victims who have been unable to pursue their claims elsewhere to sue companies that may have benefited from slave labor years ago and now have American subsidiaries. The plaintiffs hope to repeat the success of Holocaust survivors' suits, which have yielded $6.2 billion in recent settlements.</p>

        <p>Serbs Gird for Strikes  As Serbia's opposition vowed to shut down the country today, police officers, apparently sent to try to keep electricity production going, surrounded and entered an important coal mine yesterday. The miners went on strike on Friday as part of the opposition's campaign to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede defeat to Vojislav Kostunica, above, in the presidential election.</p>

        <p>First English Bill of Rights  England will get its first domestic bill of rights in a fiercely debated move that is likely to reshape the centuries-old relationship between the citizens and the government. The change comes with the scheduled enforcement of the Human Rights Act, which for the first time incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into English law.</p>

        <p>Tiananmen Square Arrests  Hundreds of followers of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement were arrested at Tiananmen Square in Beijing on China's National Day after recent instructions from their American-based leader to ''achieve consummation'' by facing imprisonment or death.</p>

        <p>First Canonizations of Chinese  Pope John Paul II canonized 120 Roman Catholics killed in China, including 87 Chinese, although the government had condemned the action as an insulting reminder of colonial imperialism. The canonizations also included Mother Katharine Drexel, a turn-of-the-century American philanthropist.</p>

        <p>Justices Face a Docket Full of Heft, if Not Flash  At first glance, the Supreme Court term that opens today figures to be a pale imitation of the blockbuster term that concluded in June. After all, there is no abortion case on the docket this time, no Miranda, no school prayer, no gay rights. But in its own perhaps less flashy way this term might well measure up to the last one for cases of far-reaching consequence.</p>

        <p>Bush Returns to Tax Cut Plan  After months of burnishing his image as a new Republican with proposals for modest social programs, Gov. George W. Bush has gone into the final sprint of the presidential race by returning his ambitious across-the-board tax cut plan to the center of his campaign.</p>

        <p>Gore's Debate Reputation  Vice President Al Gore heads into tomorrow's presidential debate with a reputation as one of the most artful, combative and practiced political debaters in modern history. But most of his practice has come at the expense of fellow Democrats.</p>
        <p>A23</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he would try a new tack -- and tone -- in his first televised debate with Mr. Bush: keep the focus on his own proposals and try to resist savaging his opponent.</p>
        <p>A24</p>
        <p>Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, accused the two major parties and their corporate supporters of stifling democracy by keeping him out of tomorrow night's presidential debates. Mr. Nader spoke to a rally of 12,000 in Boston.</p>

        <p>Battle Cry in Alabama  The rolling land along the highway that stretches from Selma to Montgomery offers little more than its rich red Alabama soil and the collective memory of its people. But a businessman's plan to build a landfill off Highway 80, near a landmark in civil rights history, has divided traditional allies and united blacks and whites on both sides.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Texas Battles Red Tide  Nearly 300 miles of Texas coast from Smith Point south to Corpus Christi are suffering from red tide, which is caused by a microscopic organism that releases toxins and depletes oxygen from the water. The toxic algae bloom kills fish and contaminates shellfish, threatening oyster beds and the state's $1 billion-a-year fishing industry.</p>

        <p>Turtles Released Into Sea  Three sea turtles outfitted with transmitters were released into the open ocean off San Diego as part of a research program to track their migration through the Pacific to nesting grounds in Japan. The Pacific loggerheads have lived at Sea World for more than two decades.</p>

        <p>Peace for Vietnamese Refugees  Vietnamese have been coming to New Orleans for 25 years, resettled by the Roman Catholic Church after the fall of South Vietnam. Even as they have assimilated, they also have created a world that sounds and feels like home.</p>

        <p>Lazio Supports Approval Of the Abortion Pill  Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, declared that he supported the legalization of the abortion-inducing drug RU-486, breaking from the position taken by his party's presidential nominee. But Mr. Lazio said he opposed allowing the government to pay for the drug for poor women.</p>

        <p>Ex-Pastor Is Focus of Inquiry  The retired pastor of a large Roman Catholic church in Queens is suspected of stealing millions of dollars from his affluent parish and giving much of it away, officials said.</p>

        <p>New York Airports Lose Edge  A rise in flight delays at Kennedy and La Guardia Airports, inadequate cargo facilities and chronic traffic congestion have caused the airports to lose much of their competitive edge and have cost Queens an opportunity to add jobs, a report said.</p>

        <p>TV Season of Promise and Risk  For network programmers the television season that gets off to a belated start tonight blooms with more promise than any since the mid-1990's; it also looms with just as much threat. The networks learned a vivid lesson last season: real hits are still possible.</p>

        <p>Studies Showed Tire Problems  Firestone officials in Venezuela conducted at least two studies in 1999 that reviewed patterns of tire problems there while assuring Ford that tire failures in the country were isolated cases resulting from customer abuse and poor maintenance, internal Firestone documents show.</p>
