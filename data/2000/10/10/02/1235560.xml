        <p>'Titans'</p>
        <p>NBC, Wednesday night at 8</p>
        <p>This latest collection of soap flakes from Aaron Spelling -- sort of ''Dallas'' comes to ''Beverly Hills 90210'' -- centers on the incredibly rich Williams family. They may control a hugely successful multinational something or other, but the Williamses can't stand looking at one another. You, on the other hand, are supposed to love looking at all of them. Go figure.</p>

        <p>'Titans'</p>
        <p>NBC, Wednesday night at 8</p>
        <p>This latest collection of soap flakes from Aaron Spelling -- sort of ''Dallas'' comes to ''Beverly Hills 90210'' -- centers on the incredibly rich Williams family. They may control a hugely successful multinational something or other, but the Williamses can't stand looking at one another. You, on the other hand, are supposed to love looking at all of them. Go figure.</p>
        <p>Dad (Perry King) and Mom (Victoria Principal) are divorced and live in facing mansions. Dad is about to marry a sexy young schemer (Yasmine Bleeth), not knowing that she was very recently the lover of his heroic son (Casper Van Dien), whose success is deeply resented by Dad's creepy son (John Barrowman). There are two overwrought daughters, the overachiever (Josie Davis) and the hopeless drunk (Elizabeth Bogush); they make too much noise, wear too little clothing and say things like ''I know something about you that no one else knows.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of secrets, this is a show that no one will admit watching. But judging from Mr. Spelling's track record with this kind of applesauce, some of you will be lying.</p>
