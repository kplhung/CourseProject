        <p>When a videotape accusing President Jacques Chirac of overseeing a vast illicit fund-raising kickback scheme first surfaced two weeks ago, there was lots of talk about how the fuss would blow over soon. After all, experts argued, the French were used to scandals over the financing of political parties and Mr. Chirac had survived being mentioned in connection with such activities before.</p>
        <p>Such reasoning is not heard much anymore. With unforeseen speed, this scandal has radically altered the dynamics of the 2002 presidential race.</p>
        <p>With prosecutors searching the homes and offices of the various players in this drama almost every day last week, the full scope of the scandal is not known. But already the damage has been extraordinary, enveloping not only Mr. Chirac, but also his chief rival, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, whose former finance minister admitted that he had been given the incriminating tape two years ago, but had never turned it over to the authorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac has denied all the accusations on the tape, made by a former aide who died last year of cancer. But there are growing signs that he has been severely weakened; in one survey conducted last week, 75 percent of those polled said they believed that the president owed them an explanation. Fully 23 percent thought he should leave office. And 31 percent believed that Mr. Jospin was also tainted by the scandal.</p>
        <p>Last month, a 2002 presidential race between Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin seemed set in stone. Now, political experts ruminate on who of the younger generation might be up to the task. Several newspapers ran profiles on the leaders of France's smaller parties. One survey concluded that 54 percent of the voters wanted to see something other than a Jospin-Chirac race.</p>
        <p>''What we are seeing is like an earthquake,'' said Dominique Moisi,  an analyst with the French Institute of International Relations, an independent think tank. ''The result of a huge earthquake.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moisi, like many others, said the images on the tape have had a far greater impact than other evidence dredged up against Mr. Chirac in the past, including letters he wrote that appear to link him to use of government money to pay employees of his conservative Rally for the Republic party. ''The audiovisual aspect of the thing is so powerful,'' Mr. Moisi said. ''And because these are charges coming from the grave, that too is a very dramatic thing.''</p>
        <p>Only a few months ago, France was bursting with confidence: its leaders were playing a central role in debating the future of Europe, the economy was booming and the future seemed bright. But the revelations of corruption and secret machinations reaching to the very heart of France's political elite have, some experts say, raised new self-doubt.</p>
        <p>''In a few weeks, or even just a few days, all that has changed,'' the historian Jean D'Ormesson noted in his column in Le Figaro. ''The government is in crisis.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin were already suffering in the polls when the latest scandal broke. Mr. Jospin incurred voters' wrath for tarrying over a plan for long-awaited tax cuts despite a huge budget surplus. And truckers, fishermen, taxi drivers and others got strong popular support when they blocked roads and ports to protest high fuel taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jospin eventually reduced the levies, but his popularity ratings dropped 20 points in a single month. Mr. Chirac's fell 9 percent, with both men suffering from the debacle over  a referendum last weekend on reducing the presidential term from seven years to five. The measure -- backed by both -- passed easily, but 70 percent of voters abstained, and nearly two million who did go to the polls returned either an empty envelope or a ripped-up ballot to register their disdain for a question that many saw as tailored more to the politicians' needs than to voters' daily lives.</p>
        <p>The morning after the vote, the cover of one of France's leading newspapers, Liberation, was black but for two miniature cartoon figures of Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin standing side by side, holding lanterns that lit up a small patch of space. The point was clear enough: France's two leading politicians were in the dark when it came to knowing the interests of the people.</p>
        <p>In the latest scandal, most experts say Mr. Chirac has the most at stake. The videotaped confession is of questionable use as evidence since the man who made it, Jean-Claude Mery, cannot be cross-examined. But it does offer the most direct charges yet that Mr. Chirac was involved in illicit fund-raising when he was the mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.  During that time, Mr. Mery said, he collected some $5 million a year for his party from contractors dealing with the city. Once, he said, Mr. Chirac was in the room when he gave one of Mr. Chirac's aides about $700,000 in cash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jospin could be in trouble mostly because his squeaky-clean image may be tarnished by even a whiff of association with scandal -- in this case, reports that his former finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, had been given the Mery tape by a lawyer who wanted a tax break for his client. Mr. Jospin had denied knowing anything about the tape before reading transcripts from it in Le Monde. But supporters of Mr. Chirac have accused him of in effect secretly beginning a brutal 2002 election campaign.</p>
        <p>The cassette was brought forward by an independent journalist, Arnaud Hamelin, who helped Mr. Mery make the tape five years ago. Mr. Mery said on the tape that he wanted it made public if he died under suspicious circumstances. If Mr. Mery died of natural causes, Mr. Hamelin said he was free to do as he liked with the tape. Apparently, Mr. Mery's lawyer gave the original to Mr. Strass-Kahn even before Mr. Mery died.</p>
        <p>Last week, investigators scoured Paris looking for the original, which Mr. Strauss-Kahn said he had misplaced, and supporting documents that may or may not exist. So far, all that has been found are two letters suggesting that Mr. Mery was paid to keep quiet about the kickbacks.</p>
        <p>Trying to find a way out of the scandal for Mr. Chirac, the spokesman for his party, Patrick Devedjian, floated the idea of a blanket amnesty so that ''all political parties could unburden themselves of their guilty past.'' That caused an uproar, even among party faithful, in part because it seemed to suppose that Mr. Chirac was guilty. To no one's surprise, Mr. Jospin's supporters rejected an amnesty, saying that justice must take its course.</p>
        <p>One leading Socialist, Francois Hollande, then suggested that voters should ask all future candidates for the presidency to renounce their presidential immunity as a way of assuring that they had clean hands. Smaller parties have called for a parliamentary investigation.</p>
        <p>An editorial in the influential magazine L'Express called on Mr. Chirac to move quickly to new elections, arguing that Mr. Chirac should apply the new five-year term now, rather than at the end of his current seven-year incumbency. Mr. Chirac, who loses his immunity if he loses his job, has little incentive to do so.</p>
        <p>No matter what, his image seems damaged. ''Something like this is a real handicap,'' said Alain Duhamel, a conservative political analyst. ''He will be social; he will go abroad. But he has lost stature.''</p>
