        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I was driving my usual commuting route recently on the first day of school when I came upon a large yellow school bus. I followed it through several stops and starts as it loaded excited children. Finally we arrived at a driveway with 10 or 15 children waiting with their parents. The parents watched quietly while the children boarded and settled down. As the doors closed and the bus moved on, the parents erupted with cheers as they exchanged high-fives to celebrate the start of another school year.</p>

        <p>A CITY PRAYER</p>
        <p>May the masonry of this world never</p>
        <p>Land on my head. May the local squirrels</p>
        <p>Shun my attic. May my jack and spare tire</p>
        <p>Remain sparkling clean and unused. May the</p>
        <p>Autumn leaves never find my gutters, my</p>
        <p>Basement never overflow of mighty</p>
        <p>Waters. May my car attract almost no</p>
        <p>Attention. May all these prayers be answered</p>
        <p>And all your supplicants find peace without</p>
        <p>The cacophony of car alarm, tonight.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I decided to give myself a strange gift for my birthday this summer. For one day only, I would indulge in self-pity and I would aim it at impositions placed on my life by multiple sclerosis. I ordered a handicapped-accessible bus from the Command Bus Company for a trip I needed to make to Brooklyn and I mentioned to Tom Geraci, the operations director, that I hated my illness because it limited my flexibility and necessitated such things as ordering an accessible bus in advance. I also told him that it was my birthday and that I was feeling sorry for myself. Although we had talked on the telephone before, we had never met.</p>
        <p>I arrived at the bus stop near my Manhattan apartment with my rolling walker, and a man wearing the bus company cap and carrying a bouquet of flowers greeted me. He wished me a happy birthday, and told me that the flowers were from Tom and that the driver would not charge me for the ride. When I arrived at my destination and the driver commented on the flowers, I told them they were from his boss and that I was going to call to thank him. The driver said, ''You can thank him now -- there he is.'' There was Tom, waiting to greet me with a hug, a birthday card, a good luck message and some lottery tickets. I didn't win the lottery, but I will never again consider feeling sorry for myself.</p>

        <p>Henry Goldsmith recently recalled when he and a publishing colleague, John Stevenson, turned 65 and were given a New York City card that entitled them to travel at half fare. They boarded a bus and Mr. Goldsmith began to fish out his card, but Mr. Stevenson stopped him. ''Here's what you do,'' Mr. Stevenson said. ''You get on and drop in the half fare, and if the driver challenges you and asks for proof of age, you show him the card. And then you tip him.''</p>
        <p>Laura Gallagher was awakened from a deep sleep by two men talking loudly on her front stoop. She put on a robe, opened the door and asked them politely if they would move because their voices were carrying into her bedroom. They apologized and left. The next morning she opened the door,  and to her considerable amazement, there was a bouquet of flowers addressed to the ''tired lady.'' An accompanying note, signed Ron and Clark, said they were sorry and wanted to apologize for their inconsiderate behavior.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Recently, after a series of cardiac tests, it was recommended that I have a pacemaker installed. I was referred to Dr. Stephen Haveson, a Manhattan vascular surgeon who had many years of experience in the procedure, and I was also told he had a special way of making his patients feel at ease.</p>
        <p>The day arrived, and shortly before the procedure was to begin, a rich baritone voice came over the audio system in the operating room. The tune was ''Matchmaker, Matchmaker'' from ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' The voice was that of the surgeon, and he began singing his version of the words: ''Pacemaker, pacemaker, we will make you O.K. Tra-la-la, tra-la-la.'' It was certainly a special way of putting patients at ease, and it worked.</p>

        <p>A song not quite so appreciated: An apparently homeless man on a Sixth Avenue express train during the rush hour was singing notes from what Michael Hamm described as ''some doo-wop song or other.'' When he concluded, a fellow passenger asked if he'd take a request. ''Sure,'' he said. The passenger advised: ''Get a job.''</p>
        <p>THE LADIES WHO BRIDGE</p>
        <p>We talk about theater and our favorite book</p>
        <p>We talk about clothes and how we should look</p>
        <p>We speak of our friends and preparing new dishes</p>
        <p>We even express our fantasy wishes</p>
        <p>Our children and grandkids come into the mix</p>
        <p>We tell of their progress while taking in tricks</p>
        <p>We reflect on the past and how we were then</p>
        <p>We laugh at our jokes and scoff at our men</p>
        <p>We hold forth on politics and food in our fridge</p>
        <p>But never, no, never, do we discuss bridge.</p>
        <p>SHIRLEE SLOYER</p>
        <p>Steven Schechter has taken the Microsoft Book Shelf 2000 definition of carpal tunnel syndrome as the pattern for his definition of Lincoln Tunnel syndrome:</p>
        <p>A form of repetitive strain injury to the psyche. Making the same daily commute over and over can cause swelling and scarring of the soft tissue of the cerebellum, which compresses the main nerve leading to the cerebral cortex. Symptoms of Lincoln Tunnel syndrome include pain and tingling in the brain, and in advanced cases, complete loss of functionality. Repeatedly passing through a Manhattan-bound tunnel during rush hour without proper emotional support is a common cause of Lincoln Tunnel syndrome.</p>
        <p>Five-year-old Kate Condon lives in Chatham, Mass., and when she lost her first tooth she found $1 under her pillow from the Chatham Tooth Fairy. She called Shirley Feder, her grandmother in Nyack, N.Y., to give her the news, and Mrs. Feder sent her $1 with a note that said it was from the Nyack Tooth Fairy. When Kate discovered the dollar bill under her pillow, she again called. ''It's amazing,, Grandma,'' she said. ''The Chatham Tooth Fairy e-mailed the Nyack Tooth Fairy!''</p>
