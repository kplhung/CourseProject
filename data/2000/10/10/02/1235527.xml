        <p>An increase in flight delays at Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports, inadequate cargo facilities and chronic traffic congestion around both airports have caused them to lose much of their competitive edge to other major American airports, and have cost Queens an opportunity to add jobs, according to a report released yesterday.</p>
        <p>The report, by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, said that both airports have experienced slower growth in passenger travel than most major American airports. It added that the cargo industry at Kennedy has been hurt by a space shortage that has led many airlines to move their shipping operations.</p>
        <p>In 1991, the report showed, Kennedy -- which still serves more international passengers than any other airport in the country -- was the nation's seventh busiest passenger airport and the world's busiest cargo hub. By 1999, it was the 14th busiest passenger airport and the world's fifth busiest cargo airport, according to the report.</p>
        <p>La Guardia, where the Federal Aviation Administration last week said delays had more than doubled in the last year, was the 15th busiest passenger airport in 1991 and the 20th in 1999.</p>
        <p>Other airports have created thousands of jobs in the last decade, including Newark International Airport, which has added 10,718 jobs since 1989 -- a 79 percent increase. But during the same period, employment declined at Kennedy and grew moderately at La Guardia.</p>
        <p>In 1999, the two airports employed 47,000 people in what are known as on-airport jobs: mechanic, ticket agent, restaurant worker and baggage handler. An additional 270,000 people held airport-related jobs, including travel agent and truck and taxi driver, the report showed.</p>
        <p>The on-airport jobs at Kennedy have declined by 9 percent, or 3,578 jobs, since 1989, the report said, while the number of those jobs at have risen at La Guardia by 14 percent, or 1,204 jobs. The report said that job growth at other major airports, including Miami International Airport and O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, far outpaced that of New York City's airports.</p>
        <p>Officials with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark Airports, said the decline in job growth at Kennedy was came largely because Eastern and Pan Am airlines, once the largest employers at that airport, both went out of business in 1991. Since 1992, that airport has added about 1,500 jobs annually, said an authority spokesman, Greg Trevor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trevor also noted that a $9 billion redevelopment program is under way at Kennedy. The plan involves rebuilding several terminals and includes a $600 million renovation and rebuilding of cargo centers.</p>
        <p>The report called the redevelopment program and other projects, including the $1.9 billion AirTrain light-rail system that will link Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan to Kennedy Airport in Queens by 2003, ''important steps.'' But it said that those measures fell far short of the investment needed to ensure the vitality of the two airports and their contribution to the local economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trevor said the Port Authority views the three airports as part of one system that has grown significantly in the last decade. ''The system is very healthy, the system is doing very well, and I think that's more important than the question of who ranks 8th or 9th or 10th on a list,'' he said.</p>
        <p>According to figures in the new report, most of the system's growth has stemmed from increases in travel and shipping through Newark.</p>
        <p>City officials, long critical of the Port Authority's management of the airports, said the report provided further proof that the agency had helped Newark airport flourish at the expense of the two in the city.</p>
        <p>The two airports generate about $150 million in annual revenues, but Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said that money was being used for other Port Authority operations, including the PATH train, instead of being reinvested. The Giuliani administration has said that management of the airports, which the authority leases from the city, should be privatized.</p>
