        <p>The leadership of three of the  world's most vital democracies  close allies, all -- could change hands by the coming spring.</p>
        <p>What would it mean if George Bush and Dick Cheney replaced Clinton-Gore; if Britain's William Hague and Michael Portillo swept Tony Blair and Gordon Brown out of office, and if Israel's Bibi Netanyahu and Arik Sharon took over from Ehud Barak and Ehud Barak?</p>
        <p>Granted, the odds are against such a worldwide conservative ''hat trick.'' But the right's chances have been improving lately:</p>
        <p>In the U.S., Bush has undergone a reversal of poll misfortune; if he strongly exceeds expectations in debate tomorrow, he will become the king of swing voters.</p>
        <p>In Britain, Blair's popularity took a plunge as the price of heavily taxed gasoline shot up and he arrogantly mishandled the reaction. But he had been riding for a fall as his mighty millennial pleasure dome, with half the expected customers, became a financial fiasco. His Labor Party is beginning to split over the issue of the wobbly euro while Hague's Conservatives are together in popular defense of the independent pound sterling.</p>
        <p>In Israel, the respected attorney general decided not to join a political witch hunt and Netanyahu, unindicted, will re-enter politics with a popular lead over the self-isolated Barak. Palestinian violence after Sharon's pre-Rosh Hashana visit to the Temple Mount, unrestrained by Yasir Arafat, diminished the dangerous notion of divided sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Assume for speculation's sake that all three parties of the right make it. How would relationships among their countries change?</p>
        <p>Clinton and Blair struck up a fine friendship, and their nations have been close allies in the Persian Gulf and in the Balkans. But Blair's desire to scrap economic sovereignty and thereby integrate Britain with Europe -- as well as his avid embrace and misplaced sponsorship of Russia's Vladimir Putin -- put long-range policy strains on the English-speaking Atlantic partnership.</p>
        <p>Bush and Hague would have no such conflicts in their world views. Hague envisions an expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement to the European Union, presumably with Britain as the fulcrum. That suits the U.S. more than the goal of a ''United States of Europe,'' dominated by Germany and France, that Clinton-Gore rhetoric tended to encourage.</p>
        <p>What changes would a rightward swing make in dealings with Israel? With Britain, not much; Israelis say that both Blair and Hague have advisers trusted not to tilt toward Arab interests. With America, the possible change is a mystery.</p>
        <p>Clinton-Gore had prickly relations with Netanyahu. Recently, Clinton's ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, publicly called for the division of Jerusalem; his extreme statement stands as Clinton policy.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Gore would repudiate that position, long rejected by Netanyahu, if asked about it in tomorrow night's debate; Bush surely would. Pro-Israeli hard-liners have greater trust in Gore than Clinton, but when Gore adopts a favorite administration formulation -- that the U.S. should stand with Israel when Israel takes risks for peace -- the question arises, What about when those risks are too great?</p>
        <p>Would Bush twist Netanyahu's arm to make previously unthinkable concessions, as Clinton and Indyk did with Barak? The jury is out on that because the memory of his father's gurus, James Baker and Brent Scowcroft, still rankles. But when George W.'s national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, visited Israel last month, she seemed impressed with the strategic value of the Golan Heights. And if George Shultz continues to be the elder-statesman adviser to Bush the younger, White House arm-twisting on security would stop.</p>
        <p>What are the odds against conservatives pulling off the hat trick in the U.S. in November, in Israel in January, in Britain in May? My local glitzy casino owner says nine to one at best.</p>
        <p>Geopolitical realists will shorten the odds by choosing other combinations of right, left and third way-out: Bush-Blair-Barak, for example, or a gridlocks-and-eggs special of Gore-Hague-Netanyahu.</p>
        <p>Or are we headed toward no change at all -- the ancient Roman status quo vadis? We cannot ignore the possibility of the liberal's trilateral trifecta: Gore-Blair-Barak. I don't want to even think about that.</p>
