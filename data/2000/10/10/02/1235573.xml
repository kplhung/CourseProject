        <p>MANHATTAN: CENTRAL PARK ROBBERY  Two women were robbed at knifepoint early yesterday morning as they sat on a bench in Central Park, the authorities said. The police said the women were sitting together inside the park near West 102nd Street just before 1 a.m. when a man took a seat beside them, threatened them with a knife and demanded money. The women gave the man a bracelet, a cellular phone and a watch, and the man ran off, Officer Joseph Cavitolo said. Neither women was injured, the police said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: CITY HALL PARK SLEEP-IN  Twenty-five people protesting the latest round of rent increases for rent-stabilized apartments were allowed by the police to spend last night camped just outside the gates of City Hall Park, said Deputy Inspector William Callahan. The rent increases, which took effect yesterday, allow landlords of the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments to raise the rent on a one-year lease by 4 percent and a two-year lease by 6 percent. The city's Rent Guidelines Board adopted the increases in June. The protesters, led by the Metropolitan Council on Housing, wanted to sleep in the park, but the police would not allow it, and a compromise was reached.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: GENETIC MODIFICATION DEBATED  The State Assembly is considering a five-year moratorium on genetically engineered crops. Assemblyman Jack McEneny, an Albany Democrat and the bill's sponsor, said last week that some of the foods derived from biotech plants that were acceptable in the United States were being rejected by foreign markets. And Pamela Hadad-Hurst, executive director of the New York Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides, said biotech crops can kill pests as well as beneficial insects. Opponents of the moratorium, speaking at a public hearing last week, said genetically engineered crops had produced the strongest and healthiest crops in history, and contended that the freeze would prevent New York farmers from sharing advantageous developments in the future. Hearings in Ithaca and Rochester are planned for this week and in Queens on Oct. 24.</p>

        <p>NEPTUNE: RESCUE AT SEA  A man who had a heart attack on a fishing boat several miles off the New Jersey coast was rescued yesterday by the New York City police aviation unit, the police said. At 12:15 p.m., the police heard a distress call on a civilian radio band saying that a passenger was having a heart attack aboard the Bandit, a 75-foot fishing boat, said Officer Gary Cillo, a police spokesman. A police helicopter flew from Breezy Point in Queens 18 miles south to the Bandit, and Officer James McVey, who is a medical technician, was lowered into the boat, Officer Cillo said. Officer McVey revived the 51-year-old man, whose name was not released. The victim was then flown to Jersey Shore Medical Center here, where he was in critical condition last night.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: ABUSE ALLEGED AT YALE HOSPITAL  The state will investigate claims that a psychiatric patient suspected of faking catatonia was subjected to a painful and unnecessary examination of his chest while being treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital. The patient, Martin Morse, 35, of North Branford, said that on Sept. 5 a nurse administered a ''sternum rub'' that made subsequent breathing and eating difficult. The hospital sent Mr. Morse a letter of apology five days later. Mark D'Antonio, a hospital spokesman, said the hospital was bound by patient confidentiality and could not comment on specific cases.</p>
