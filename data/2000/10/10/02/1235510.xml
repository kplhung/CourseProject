        <p>For Republicans intent on protecting and even bolstering their majority in the House of Representatives, Washington State's First Congressional District has long looked like a prime target.</p>
        <p>Curving along the northern and eastern suburbs of Seattle, the district has had a revolving-door history, with party control of the House seat having switched three times in the last decade. Republicans say the first-term First District representative who has the seat now, Jay Inslee, is one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the country.</p>
        <p>But in the curious sort of ''beauty contest'' that took place here last week in the primary, the Republican challenger, state Senator Dan McDonald, got a bit of rude news.</p>
        <p>Despite a heavy television advertising campaign against him -- ''Jay Inslee: fighting for more taxes,'' intoned the narrator; ''Dan McDonald: fighting for our future'' -- Mr. Inslee finished 14 points ahead of the challenger. Heading into the general election, that strong showing has cut into Republican contentions that the incumbent is on the ropes and could well complicate Mr. McDonald's drive to raise more money in the  closing stretch of the campaign.</p>
        <p>Neither man faced any opposition for his party's nomination, and last week's vote will have no official bearing on the November election. And the state's blanket primary system, under which a voter may select any candidate on the ballot, is on its last leg anyway: because of a United States Supreme Court ruling this year that invalidated a similar system in California, the primary rules will almost certainly be different in future elections here.</p>
        <p>But results of the blanket primary have long been used as a rough gauge of an incumbent's popularity, and by that measure, Mr. Inslee had plenty to crow about.</p>
        <p>''To wind up with a double-digit lead when the other fellow was up with all this negative advertising, and when I haven't even spent a nickel on television advertising yet, that's a pretty good showing,'' said Mr. Inslee, who once represented a district across the state in eastern Washington. After he was ousted in the Republican sweep of 1994, he moved across the Cascade Mountains and turned out the Republican incumbent here, Rick White, in 1998, partly by focusing on voters' wrath over the Republican drive to impeach President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald, 56, a genial engineer who has been in the state Legislature for 22 years, brushed off the results of the primary, in which he took 42 percent of the vote. (By contrast, in the race for an open House seat in the adjoining Second Congressional District, the Republican finished a few points ahead of the Democrat.)</p>
        <p>''They're an interesting snapshot, but there are still a lot of people that haven't been heard from who will be heard in November,'' Mr. McDonald said of the results in an interview the other day, just after a tour of a motorcycle shop here as he campaigned on helping small businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald said that Mr. Inslee benefited from the fact that he was still better known because of his incumbency. And, he argued, Democrats had a much higher turnout because there was a contest for their United States Senate nomination, one that featured Maria Cantwell, who was the congresswoman in the district here before she was voted out in 1994. And, when Mr. Inslee was the challenger two years ago, Mr. McDonald noted, he drew only 44 percent of the vote in the primary.</p>
        <p>In his campaign, Mr. McDonald has focused relentlessly on his drive to cut taxes and to increase local control of education. Senator McDonald said he would have another advantage in November because the district, in his view, leaned slightly toward Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Inslee said in an interview that the district ''is leaning toward positions my party is carrying forward in this campaign -- standing for a good, healthy environment, a good prescription drug plan, recognizing a woman's right to choose.''</p>
        <p>After his disappointing showing last week, Mr. McDonald flew to Washington, D.C., where, he said, Republican leaders assured him that his race was still one of their top priorities and that more financial help would be forthcoming. Mr. Inslee, who had his strong finish though  he put up no television advertising leading into the primary, said he would begin showing television advertisements soon.</p>
        <p>Aside from taxes and education, Mr. McDonald has brought up the issue of military preparedness, an issue he said he understood well because of his military service, which included two tours of duty in Vietnam with the Navy. And he says he knows how to reach across party lines to get things accomplished.</p>
        <p>''Take prescription drugs as an example,'' Mr. McDonald said. ''Jay Inslee held a press conference and he said, the Democratic plan is brilliant, the Republican plan is stupid. Now that is not how you get to a compromise.''</p>
        <p>Interviews with voters in the district suggested that many were looking beyond the two particular candidates, both of whom seemed well liked, and trying to decide which party should control the House. And, in this regard, there may be some good news for Mr. McDonald.</p>
        <p>''I like Jay Inslee and all, his heart's in the right place, but I'd like to see the Republicans keep control in the Congress,'' explained Joseph Andrews, a retired aircraft salesman who lives on Bainbridge Island. ''I mean, Clinton adopted their Contract With America, he made it all seem like it was his idea, but it was really the Republicans. I think they deserve to keep that majority.''</p>
        <p>And Douglas Rosen, a motorcycle mechanic at the shop Mr. McDonald toured here in Lynnwood, said Republicans may have better ideas on education, his top concern.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's a matter of money, so much as structure and accountability,'' explained Mr. Rosen, a father of three. ''Though I do think teachers deserve a raise.''</p>
        <p>Conversely, at least one voter who favored Gov. George W. Bush in the presidential election said that preference would probably lead her to vote for Mr. Inslee, the Democrat, in the Congressional election.</p>
        <p>''I've liked having split control in Washington, D.C.,'' said Susan LaFramboise, an insurance adjuster from Poulsbo, Wash. ''I just think you get a little more well-rounded vote on things.''</p>
