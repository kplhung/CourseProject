        <p>With the outbreak of the last four days of violence, the prospect that President Clinton can broker an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before he leaves office has all but evaporated, diplomats and other experts said today.</p>
        <p>Boxed in by a very short timetable that in effect ends with the American presidential election, it appears more unlikely than ever, they said, that the administration will be able to restore meaningful talks after the latest shattering of trust.</p>
        <p>Several experts pronounced the peace effort virtually dead, at least for the rest of Mr. Clinton's administration, largely because of the time it would take to reinvigorate a process that was already deadlocked over the future status of the Old City of Jerusalem, the very place that prompted the violence.</p>
        <p>In addition, the violence and the loss of trust it has generated may further undercut the peacemaking efforts of Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, who was already in a weakened political position. And the clashes may also make it more difficult for the Palestinian leader, Yasir  Arafat, to deliver the concessions that the administration has been looking for him to make.</p>
        <p>When he left the Camp David summit meeting in July, Mr. Arafat made it clear that he wanted the Palestinians to control East Jerusalem and that notions of shared sovereignty or ''divine'' sovereignty over the holy sites were unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Now that violence has broken out after a visit by Ariel Sharon, the rightist Israeli opposition leader, to the very places being contested in the negotiations, Mr. Arafat may feel that any concession will be seen as a betrayal.</p>
        <p>Still, administration officials put on a brave public face today, saying the White House was in touch with both sides. Mr. Clinton spoke to Mr. Barak on Saturday night and to Mr. Arafat by telephone this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton told both leaders that as soon as calm was restored, the  United States would convene a meeting of Palestinian and Israeli security officials in the region for a fact-finding session to figure out what went wrong, a White House spokesman said.</p>
        <p>But as administration officials argued for calm, they also faced their thin hopes for a peace agreement evaporating in the gun battles between Israeli and Palestinian forces.</p>
        <p>''This is not just another outburst of violence,'' said Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. ''This will have the most profound effect on the Israeli public. People in the last decade were optimistic the Arab-Israeli conflict was over. This opens some very old books.''</p>
        <p>The violence came as the administration had been feverishly trying in the last two weeks to come up with solutions to the most difficult issues left over from the summit meeting in July.</p>
        <p>Ten days ago, the administration compiled a summary of the Israeli and Palestinian positions. After discussing with aides whether to present that summary and other proposals to both sides, Mr. Clinton decided to hold off, a White House official said.</p>
        <p>According to several accounts, the president signed off on a set of ''bridging proposals'' that outlined what the administration believed were the most promising solutions to the outstanding issues.</p>
        <p>But instead of formally presenting the summary and its ideas to the two sides, the administration brought the top negotiators from Israel and the Palestinian Authority to Washington last week to see if they could make any headway. They left on Thursday, officials said, with little accomplished; that was the same day that Mr. Sharon made his tour of the ancient mosques atop the Old City.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Washington was reaching out to other possible mediators last week to pursue a solution to the Jerusalem issue that would involve the United Nations Security Council in managing the sites that are holy to Jews and Muslims.</p>
        <p>According to an account of one the most recent proposals, the holy sites would fall under ''divine'' sovereignty and the Security Council would authorize management of specific sites to either the Israelis or the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>But the extremely delicate nature of this solution and the intricate diplomacy under way involving the United States, the United Nations, European leaders and diplomats as well as the Israelis and Palestinians presented a tough chore even in peaceful times in the region, diplomats and experts said today.</p>
        <p>''Any agreement on Jerusalem has to got to be a cooperative arrangement, and events have shown that the mutual trust required for such an agreement just isn't there,'' said Alan Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of precedents in which violence threatened to derail Middle East peace accords. In February 1994, for instance, a Jewish settler fired on Muslims praying at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, killing 29 Palestinians. But both sides finally signed an agreement three months later.</p>
        <p>But that was a simpler negotiation, by comparison. The task faced by Mr. Clinton is more complex, and he has less time in which to complete it.</p>
