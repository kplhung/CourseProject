        <p>Firestone officials in Venezuela conducted at least two studies in 1999 that reviewed patterns of tire problems there while assuring Ford that tire failures in the country were isolated cases resulting from customer abuse and poor maintenance, internal Firestone documents show.</p>
        <p>The two studies are of interest because they describe dozens of cases in which steel-belted radial tires had treads and belts that were coming apart -- the same problem that led to the recall of Firestone ATX and Wilderness AT 15-inch tires in the United States on Aug. 9. But neither study compares the number of cases with the number of tires manufactured, making it difficult to assess the scope of the problem.</p>
        <p>There have been 103 deaths blamed on Firestone tires in the United States and 46 more in Venezuela, mostly in Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, on which most of the problem tires have been mounted. American regulators began a separate investigation on Friday into Firestone Steeltex tires, which are used on the largest sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans.</p>
        <p>A Firestone spokeswoman said that tread and belt separations were the most common problem in radial tires and could be the result of many factors, including road hazards, improper repair and underinflation, rather than a manufacturing defect.</p>
        <p>But Hector Rodriguez, the vice president for purchasing at Ford of Venezuela, said today that although Ford asked Firestone repeatedly to check its tires in 1998 and 1999, Firestone never shared the existence or results of the two studies with Ford. Ford even shipped a failed tire to Firestone in late 1998, asking whether it was part of a broader problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez said that he was furious and had switched all of Ford's tire purchases for new cars and light trucks in Venezuela to Goodyear in the last two weeks. ''With this information, we have lost total confidence not only in local officials but with the corporation and the brand,'' he said. ''I feel betrayed.''</p>
        <p>The Firestone spokeswoman said that she did not know what memorandums were shared in Venezuela.</p>
        <p>The first study by Firestone officials in Venezuela, completed in January 1999, said that 47 tires with separation problems had been replaced under warranty since 1995. The study noted that 13 had been imported from the United States.</p>
        <p>The second study, completed in November 1999, pointed out that tires on Chevrolet Grand Blazer sport utilities -- a model no longer sold in the United States -- had a higher percentage of warranty claims involving tread and belt separation than the tires on Ford Explorers. Ford has said that the tires were poorly made, and Ford officials said today that they had photos of two Toyota Land Cruisers, a Neon small car and a Blazer, which is smaller than the Grand Blazer, that crashed in Venezuela after Firestone tires failed.</p>
        <p>Firestone has contended that tire problems in Venezuela are the fault of the Explorer's design, and has blamed the design of sport utility vehicles in general for tire problems in the United States. G.M. officials had no immediate comment tonight.</p>
        <p>Firestone memorandums reviewing the results of the two studies were buried in a five-inch-thick stack of Ford and Firestone files that Congressional investigators released three weeks ago. A Ford lawyer noticed the memorandums, and Ford officials in Venezuela made them available today.</p>
        <p>Last Monday, Congressional investigators released a Firestone memorandum from May in which the tire maker's officials in Venezuela said that there had been no tire-related deaths in Grand Blazers there and concluded that the Explorer must be particularly prone to roll over.</p>
        <p>But no agency in Venezuela collects national traffic death figures. In the United States, where such records exist, the insurance industry has calculated that Explorer occupants have a below-average rate of rollover deaths compared with occupants of other midsize sport utility vehicles, but still a much higher rate than occupants of midsize cars.</p>
