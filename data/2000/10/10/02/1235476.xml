        <p>As the Lyon Dance Biennial approached its close on Sunday, the contrasts between East and West within the three-week festival's theme, ''The Silk Roads,'' were amazingly sharp.</p>
        <p>As usual, Guy Darmet, the biennial's artistic director, offered what other dance festivals do not: a concentrated overview of dance in a single country or in theme-related regions.

        <p>As the Lyon Dance Biennial approached its close on Sunday, the contrasts between East and West within the three-week festival's theme, ''The Silk Roads,'' were amazingly sharp.</p>
        <p>As usual, Guy Darmet, the biennial's artistic director, offered what other dance festivals do not: a concentrated overview of dance in a single country or in theme-related regions. Since this year's motif conjures up the old trade routes between the Pacific and Europe, the focus is on Asian contemporary dance and Silk Road themes from a few French modern-dance troupes.</p>
        <p>The inscrutable French have come up with enigmatic if energetic premieres in which conceptual springboards are implied rather than developed. By contrast, most of the Asian choreographers, especially from Taiwan, Japan and Korea, are more legible, although their works are now rooted in Eastern philosophies. The surprise is how abruptly they have turned away from earlier American modern-dance influences.</p>
        <p>Yet viewers familiar with tai chi exercises and Buddhist ideas in an age of alternative medicine and spiritual retreats would understand what these choreographers have had to say both in their work and at news conferences here. Their stage images speak of a purification of body and soul, especially through a nuanced flow of energy, even an emptying of energy to start anew and find a different dance vocabulary.</p>
        <p>This is what Saburo Teshigawara from Japan and Lin Hwai-min, artistic director of the Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan, have done in different ways. Those who have seen their work at the Next Wave Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music would be surprised at the change in their dance idioms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teshigawara, now associated with William Forsythe, the American director of the Frankfurt Ballet in Germany, works on a high experimental level that others here did not match. At 47 he is as intense as ever in his solos, but their astounding speed and compression of movement can no longer be seen as a frenzied commentary on postindustrial Japan.</p>
        <p>There is something deeply individual in his allegory of striving toward nothingness and renewal, as he and his female partner, Kei Miyata, showed in a chillingly bare piece aptly named ''Absolute Zero.'' Karas (Crow), his company, was one of the most startling groups in a festival that was less provocative than usual this year.</p>
        <p>Another highlight was Cloud Gate's ''Moon Water,'' in which Mr. Lin extended tai chi principles into an expressively fluid dance vocabulary that related to metaphors of water and moonlight as symbols of illusion. Vestiges of Mr. Lin's previous devotion to Martha Graham's technique were visible amid the floor work of the ensemble even as the dancers were soaked in water that filled the stage. The dominant image was that of sinking and rising dancers, whose slow flow of energy and occasional thrusts fused remarkably into the flow of music in Bach's Cello Suites, excerpted on a recording by Misha Maisky.</p>
        <p>Strangely but beautifully, the dancers embodied the music just as the dance forms in which Bach wrote fit into choreography derived from a codified system of movement: a rare example of different spiritual dimensions coming together.</p>
        <p>Legend Lin Dance Theater, another established modern-dance company from Taiwan, also blended tradition with contemporary expression. In her program note the choreographer and artistic director, Lin Li-chen, paid tribute to Paul Taylor as her inspiration in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Today she appears interested in dance theater with a ritualistic sensibility. Her premiere, ''Anthem for Fading Flowers,'' was slow moving but measured as it equated four seasons with the life cycle.</p>
        <p>The ''Summer'' episode, with its muddled tribal dance, ''Autumn'' with its aging of a goddess in a delicate procession, ''Winter'' with its snowfall: these episodes paled before the strongest and first vignette, a ''Spring'' that featured an erotic duet for a near nude man and woman flowing into a variety of embraces. Ms. Lin offered beautiful pictorial images but did not deepen them. Yet here as in many other pieces, a striving for serenity and enlightenment made up the theme.</p>
        <p>Harmony of a different sort was preached by the French choreographers in their always interesting but uneven works. Lyon, like other French cities, is part of a new multiracial society with a large immigrant population. The message in the French premieres was usually oblique but about bringing together  people from different backgrounds.</p>
        <p>''Anokha,'' a social-protest piece, came from Accrorap, a hip-hop company that included Indian classical dancers and French break dancers. Each group kept to its own vocabulary and rarely imitated the other. Unity came from dancing to the same rhythm.</p>
        <p>Kader Attou, the company's talented choreographer, took the risk of presenting a swastika at the heart of the piece. This use of an ancient but now ambiguous symbol of peace, seen in front of a portrait of Gandhi, followed a scene of conflict and resolution.</p>
        <p>Jean-Claude Gallotta, Kalina Cremona and Christiane Blaise took to their hands-across-the-desert ideas very differently. Long influenced by Merce Cunningham, anything but a social-protest choreographer, they created highly formal works with messages buried deep beneath the surface.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cremona invited a ballerina and male dancers from Mongolia to the Split Ballet, a company she directs in Croatia. ''Blue Wolf,'' a legend about a wolf and a doe, was visible on paper but not onstage. Yet the choreography was riveting, largely because of the quality of movement (both powerful and delicate) that the Mongolians brought to the neo-Cunningham structure and straight-armed idiom.</p>
        <p>As one of the Mongolians sang in the diaphonic (two-voice) style reminiscent of throat singers from Siberia, the dissociation between sound and movement was complete. That the Mongolians could adapt so well to  the aesthetics of Mr. Cunningham and John Cage was a tribute to all involved.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blaise, who has performed with Trisha Brown, offered a program note about the coexistence of misery and beauty in Asia. She extended the idea into her premiere, ''Caution, Silk,'' which supposedly played upon the notion that silk is smooth but can also rip. The first half, beginning with a woman rolling in yards of silk, had a colorful dynamism that the rest of the piece did not sustain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallotta, one of French modern dance's star choreographers, can be too cerebral for his own good. But his ''Tears of Marco Polo'' had surprisingly powerful emotional moments. The nonlinear choreography, full of staccato phrases, relied on contact improvisation techniques and looked abstract. Yet the music by a Chinese composer (Shuya Xu), played by a flutist from Beijing (Weiliang Zhang), the stylized maps on the floor and references on tape to ''The Travels of Marco Polo,'' the festival's springboard, conveyed a sense of encounters among strangers.</p>
        <p>The biennial itself was a meeting ground, attracting 249 journalists from 26 countries (first-timers were from China, Georgia and Russia) and 79,060 spectators.</p>
        <p>Although none of the festivals have been as strong as the 1988 (French) and 1990 (American) biennials, this year's version had some revelations: the Shanghai Teachers College Student Dance Company with its rock ballet about urban life, complete with ergonomic chairs in a ''traffic'' jam; three generations of Indian classical dancers to show the transfer of tradition, in Madhavi Mudgal's exquisite troupe of Odissi dancers; the artistry of Djamila Henni-Chebra's belly dancing in the witty ''Nights of Alexandria'' ball.</p>
        <p>As a display in a local bookstore noted proudly, ''The Travels of Marco Polo'' was originally written in French, albeit an Italianate form. Columbus carried a dog-eared copy to the New World, which is where Mr. Darmet has set his sights for the 10th biennial in 2002. The festival will have a Latino theme, focusing on Hispanic troupes in New York, Miami and South America, with special attention to social-protest works in countries recently ruled by dictators.</p>
        <p>Given Mr. Darmet's genius for creating a new context for the familiar, the title, ''El Sol, El Sal, El Sur'' (''Sun, Salt, South''), only hints at the possibilities.</p>
