        <p>After months of burnishing his image as a new Republican with proposals for modest social programs, Gov. George W. Bush has gone into the final sprint of the presidential race by returning his ambitious across-the-board tax-cut plan to the center of his campaign.</p>
        <p>At stop after stop -- despite his party's failure to excite voters with tax-cut proposals in recent years -- Mr. Bush presents individual middle-class families to his audiences as a way of talking about tax cuts. He carefully selects families that would save about $2,000 or more under his plan and much less under Vice President Al Gore's plan.</p>
        <p>Then he will say he trusts the people to manage their own money, while Mr. Gore trusts ''the thinkers and planners and plotters'' in Washington -- language that harks all the way back to conservative criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal brain trust.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's emphasis on tax relief as one of his core issues puts him at the forefront of conservative thought and comes as Republicans in high-profile races, like the Senate candidates Rick A. Lazio in New York and George F. Allen in Virginia, have offered more modest plans instead of embracing Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>And after years of watching the Democrats charge them with endangering Social Security, Medicare and the economy through large tax-cut proposals, Congressional Republicans this year proposed a handful of smaller tax cuts and are spending the last days of the Congressional session focused on debt reduction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has stepped up his assaults on Mr. Bush's proposal, arguing that it would reward the wealthy and hurt the economy. But the governor's aides say he will succeed in using tax cutting as a mainstay of his candidacy, where others have failed, in part because the size of the surplus has weakened arguments against tax relief.</p>
        <p>In addition, they say, Mr. Bush is pitching his plan in ways Republicans have not tried in the past.</p>
        <p>The tax cut is laced into a comprehensive package of issues that also includes Social Security, Medicare and education. Each issue is used to argue that Mr. Bush allows people to make their own choices in life, while Mr. Gore would increase the power and scope of the government.</p>
        <p>''The tax cut becomes a surrogate for a broader discussion about values and the role of government,'' a Bush adviser said.</p>
        <p>And instead of portraying tax cutting in economic terms, Mr. Bush uses values-laden language. He speaks of ''fairness'' and right and wrong, words designed to blunt the traditional charge by Democrats that across-the-board tax cutting gives huge windfalls to upper-income Americans.</p>
        <p>So, for example, Mr. Bush will call his $1.3 trillion 10-year tax cut equitable because it reduces tax rates for all income brackets. And he brands Mr. Gore's smaller cut of just under $500 billion across 10 years social engineering because people get tax credits for certain social needs, like a college education, child care or long-term care for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe my job as the president is to say O.K., you're the right kind of person, you're the wrong kind of person,'' Mr. Bush frequently says. ''My job as president is to say O.K., if we're going to have tax relief, let's be fair, and everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush rarely dwells on the overall cost of his tax cut. ''Bush communicates taxes without using numbers,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ''You could criticize the Republican Party for not figuring this out before.''</p>
        <p>The lack of emphasis on a figure also serves to reduce any disharmony with Congressional Republicans, according to party strategists. They note that even if Mr. Bush and Congressional candidates are not talking about the same size tax cut, they are hitting the same themes.</p>
        <p>''We don't see it as a problem at all, because all of them say in one form or another they are embracing independent components of our plan,'' one aide to Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>In some ways, Mr. Bush had little choice but to campaign hard on his tax cut as a way of fighting Mr. Gore's claims that his opponent is for ''the powerful'' and he is for ''the people.'' Mr. Bush's aides acknowledge that the governor's proposals for overhauling Medicare, for creating a prescription drug benefit and for reshaping Social Security are complicated and can be difficult to explain in concrete ways.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Bush's Medicare plan, for example, envisions competition between private insurers and the government Medicare program, his aides cannot say with any certainty what a monthly premium would be.</p>
        <p>But they can say how much money people would receive under Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal.</p>
        <p>The idea of showcasing families to talk about tax cuts came from Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director. The governor's aides say the couples, known inside the campaign as ''tax families,'' have two purposes. They help the governor excite the Republican base with tax cutting, and they come from the same income bracket as many of those voters who are viewed as undecided in this year's presidential race.</p>
        <p>The same technique of featuring certain taxpayers has been used by both parties for years on Capitol Hill as they have vied for advantage in various policy debates.</p>
        <p>Just a few years ago, Democrats in the House and Senate were having news conferences with teachers, nurses, divorced mothers and office workers with incomes between $20,000 and $25,000 who would benefit under their tax-cut plan, while the Republicans were showcasing couples and divorced mothers earning just over $60,000.</p>
        <p>At the time, the Democrats argued that as long as the fight was over how to cut taxes, as opposed to whether to cut them, they would benefit politically, because Democrats are generally perceived as more fair and more concerned about the middle class.</p>
        <p>It is precisely such perceptions that the Bush campaign is trying to dispel. So it is no accident that the governor often showcases couples whose income hovers around the $50,000 range. In addition, his chosen couples are ones who are ineligible for Mr. Gore's many tax credit proposals: they itemize their taxes and have no children in day care, no college tuition costs and few savings.</p>
        <p>Last week the Zells of Redwood City, Calif., were one of the couples on display. Mr. Bush said that by his count they would get a $2,175 tax cut under his plan and $100 under Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has focused on particular points to try to deride Mr. Gore's plan. He notes that under Mr. Gore's proposal to end the so-called marriage penalty -- the quirk in the tax law that makes some couples pay more taxes when they marry and file jointly than when they were single -- relief is available only to couples who do not itemize. A newly married couple who buy a house and deduct the mortgage interest get no marriage penalty relief, he points out, while those who rent do.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign argues the case differently. Mr. Gore's tax-cut proposal would alleviate the marriage penalty by raising the standard deduction for married couples, which is taken only by relatively low-income people. In short, Mr. Gore's aides say, he is directing this particular tax benefit to the neediest.</p>
        <p>Democrats say they will trump Mr. Bush in the tax-cutting debate. They point to Senator John McCain, who beat Mr. Bush in the New Hampshire primary with a smaller tax-cut plan and the argument that Mr. Bush risked reopening deficits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore makes that same point nearly every day, and charges as well that Mr. Bush cannot afford to invest enough in programs like education or Medicare because of the scope of his tax cut. He and his aides also point to the tax breaks the wealthy would receive under Mr. Bush's plan.</p>
        <p>So last week, on a day when Mr. Bush was speaking of education, Ronald A. Klain, a Gore adviser, countered in a news release: ''George Bush says his priority is education, but his real priority is tax cuts for the wealthy. How can he really invest in education, when he spends so much of the surplus on tax breaks for the few?''</p>
        <p>And on Friday, Mr. Gore called Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut ''a plan which spends $667 billion on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and would wreck our good economy in the process.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's staff has also analyzed how two hypothetical families who sound a lot like the Bushes and the Cheneys would fare under Mr. Bush's tax cut.</p>
        <p>A married couple from Wyoming earning $4.4 million a year, the Gore camp said, would get a $278,000 tax cut under Mr. Bush's proposal. A Texas family with one wage earner in state government but considerable additional income of $1.3 million annually would get a $60,000 reduction, the Gore staff said.</p>
        <p>But in the Republican Party, even onetime critics of Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposal approve of the way he is now campaigning on the issue. Rick Davis, who was Mr. McCain's campaign manager, said Mr. Bush must campaign hard on his tax cut because the election is likely in the end to turn on the economy. ''I think he's doing the right thing,'' Mr. Davis said. ''If you're going to run with this big tax cut, you'd better sell it.''</p>
