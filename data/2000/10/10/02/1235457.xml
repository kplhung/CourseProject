        <p>EVEN as the French basketball team was chiseling a few more cracks in the American men's basketball monolith, drawing within 4 points in the second half of the gold medal game yesterday, I was wondering how the Israeli kayaker was doing in the men's K1 500-meter sprint out in Penrith.</p>

        <p>Before Friday, I wouldn't have known a K1 from a canine, but these things happen at the Olympics. Something apart from the spoon-fed subjects finds its way onto your radar, and one doesn't have to keep up with the Joneses every day. Television doesn't portray it this way back home, but for those of us here, the playing field can be level, if we wish it to be.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta four years ago, it was Greco-Roman wrestling at the World Congress Center downtown and women's softball in distant Columbus, Ga. In Nagano, Japan, I took the bullet train one snowy morning and became fascinated by four women from Canadian prairie towns winning the first gold medal in curling, a scene best described as four mommies with brooms making Olympic history as their husbands cheered nearby.</p>
        <p>Hopefully, the gold medal they staggered to in their 85-75 victory over France meant something to those on what was formerly known as the Dream Team. Ray Allen sincerely called this ''the best experience in my life,'' though he may not be an accurate measure of his team. He is an Air Force brat who lived in England and Germany, and has always had a sense of the world at large.</p>
        <p>Since my first Olympics at Calgary 12 years ago, the planet has become so much more connected, via cell phone and digital cameras and the Internet. A Steel Curtain opened up and the Berlin Wall came down. The East German sports machine disappeared. Russians and immigrants from the former Soviet satellite republics now represent a host of other countries, like my kayaker, Michael Kolganov, the Uzbek who was Israel's last hope yesterday for a medal after five of its athletes had finished fourth.</p>
        <p>It's still a long way from here to Miami, as Alonzo Mourning discovered when he left Sydney and made it home with 17 minutes to spare for the birth of his daughter last week. Mourning showed more manliness with that effort than he ever will on the court, yet the Americans also discovered they are no longer far enough ahead of the competition to take such liberties, to treat the Olympics like a global trade show.</p>
        <p>Even Allen said it was obvious, painfully at times, how much more team-oriented the Europeans were, and how much better a grasp of fundamentals they had. Something has to change from the way American players -- spoiled early on by Amateur Athletic Union programs that are, in effect, run by shoe companies -- are being trained. Commissioner David Stern dropped in yesterday to say he hoped the National Basketball Association's planned developmental league would be a start in that direction.</p>
        <p>''What we learn from them,'' he said of the lessons administered by the Europeans here, ''is what they learned from us.''</p>
        <p>What else are the Olympics really for? The commercialism so rampant in Atlanta was barely visible here, though I suspect the Australian taxpayers will be left with quite the hangover for having had the privilege of drawing such a crowd to their beautiful island continent. The drug taint never goes away. But the Games remain relevant as a means of opening horizons, of reminding people so confined by their kingdoms and sense of importance that the world isn't all about them.</p>
        <p>While American journalists were trying to decide if a Lithuania upset over the United States in the men's semifinals Friday night would have been as dramatic as the 1980 Miracle on Ice, the Australian network televising the Games was showing taped highlights from track and field and celebrating its beloved Hockeyroos of women's field hockey. American pride was on the line, but the Aussies weren't involved. Not a big deal.</p>
        <p>The nation that beams schmaltzy NBC feeds has nothing to feel superior about. At least the Australians didn't open their Olympic Park to the nonticket-holding public for the purpose of turning it into an international flea market. And when a rare train derailment caused spectators to miss early track and field events in the stadium Saturday night, bag checks were suspended, one night only. No worries, mate. Right this way.</p>
        <p>Trains rolled on time and the sun came out, as if it were part of the plan. Forty-seven thousand volunteers reported for duty every day. It was a crisp, efficient effort, and even the American men's basketball team, as Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said, ''got down on the floor to win the games.''</p>
        <p>With rare exceptions, things got done here, right through last night's citywide fireworks show, which I had the good fortune to watch from a restaurant terrace in Darling Harbor. In the end, it even worked out for my man Kolganov, who came through for Israel by winning the K1 500 bronze. He proceeded to carry the flag in the closing ceremony for a country that has deep political and religious divisions and is still trying to figure out what to make of imports like him.</p>
        <p>Who was going to tell Kolganov and so many others that the Olympics don't matter anymore?</p>
