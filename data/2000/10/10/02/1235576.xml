        <p>Eight or so minutes of fame on a wrestling mat with the Meanest Man in the World must be worth something on the free market, and Rulon Gardner is about to find out just how much it's worth.</p>
        <p>Gardner, the Greco-Roman wrestler from the United States, pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the Olympics when he defeated the previously unbeaten Russian Aleksandr Karelin. He said he hoped that both he and his sport would benefit from his victory.</p>
        <p>Gardner, who carried the American flag in the closing ceremony, will soon be getting his chances. They begin with an appearance on ''Tonight'' with Jay Leno on Wednesday. Also on tap, Gardner said this morning, are a photo shoot with Vanity Fair and possible television appearances with Conan O'Brien and Rosie O'Donnell. He has done the ''Today'' show from here, since NBC is carrying the Games.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to come in and make an impact,'' Gardner said. ''Hopefully, I can make some money and help wrestling. The sport can use me to say, 'Hey, here's wrestling.' ''</p>
        <p>Gardner also knows this is the time to seize the opportunities in front of him.</p>
        <p>''I wear Adidas shoes,'' Gardner said. ''I get a little money from them. I'd like that figure to go up.''</p>
        <p>What else?</p>
        <p>''Well, I grew up on a dairy farm,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He paused, and then said, ''Got milk?''</p>
