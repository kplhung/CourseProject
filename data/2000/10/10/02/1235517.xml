        <p>Vice President Al Gore heads into Tuesday's debate with a reputation as one of the most artful and combative political debaters in modern history. He is certainly one of the most practiced, having participated in 43 televised debates since he first ran for the Senate in 1984.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore heads into Tuesday's debate with a reputation as one of the most artful and combative political debaters in modern history. He is certainly one of the most practiced, having participated in 43 televised debates since he first ran for the Senate in 1984.</p>
        <p>What is evident from a recent review of many of those encounters is that Mr. Gore is uncommonly disciplined. He will question an opponent relentlessly to make a point. A ruthless competitor, he can be unflinchingly aggressive. The vice president clearly took to heart a note his mother slipped to him before a 1988 debate: ''Smile, relax, attack.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's experience leaves his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, trying to bat down the impression that Mr. Gore is the more accomplished debater. But most of Mr. Gore's practice has come at the expense of fellow Democrats. In the 1988 presidential primaries, he debated members of his own party 26 times. In the 2000 primaries, he debated former Senator Bill Bradley nine times. His debates against Republicans -- Dan Quayle in 1992 and Jack F. Kemp in 1996 -- were for the vice presidency, and his 1993 debate with Ross Perot was limited to a single issue, Nafta.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's debate in Boston will be Mr. Gore's first at the presidential level. Mr. Gore likes to say that his opponent has never lost a debate -- Mr. Bush was in two before this campaign -- because he won the ensuing elections. Almost all of Mr. Gore's opponents have been weaker performers, unprepared to address issues or to fight back. In 1988, the field was so crowded (six or seven other Democrats) that it was hard for any participant to make a mark.</p>
        <p>Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. Gore's least effective performance came against Mr. Quayle, who was not expected to offer strong competition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle was determined not to repeat his humiliating experience of 1988, when Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen told him, ''You're no Jack Kennedy.'' So Mr. Quayle ignored Mr. Gore and instead attacked Bill Clinton. Mr. Gore stuck resolutely to his message and did not defend Mr. Clinton, and wound up looking flat-footed -- and enraging Mr. Clinton. In an interview today, Mr. Gore said he had little recollection of that encounter and shrugged off the cumulative effect of Mr. Quayle's attacks.</p>
        <p>David Birdsell, who specializes in political communication and presidential debates at Baruch College, said: ''Overwhelmingly, Al Gore's principal quality as a debater is his ability to remain dead on message, from beginning to the end. This is invariant. Sometimes he is almost maniacally on message, repeating the same line so many times it sounds like a tape.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Birdsell said: ''Gore is one of the most effective attackers in debates in the business. He plays the bully in the playground, like when he beat up on Bruce Babbitt in the primary debates in '88. He started the biggest attack on Babbitt, then everyone began to treat Babbitt as a comic character, and it was all set up by Al Gore. It works for him. It has the potential to backfire, but so far he's been able to walk that line very effectively.''</p>
        <p>Spontaneity takes a holiday in Gore debates. He goes into these forums thoroughly versed in his opponent's record and ready to use it -- Mr. Bradley might say ready to distort it. When Mr. Bradley said in this year's Democratic primary that President Clinton should sign an executive order banning racial profiling, Mr. Gore countered sharply: ''Racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, Senator Bradley.''</p>
        <p>He almost never flubs, either on a point of policy or political positioning. A rare exception was his assertion in a January debate in New Hampshire that he would apply a litmus test in his appointments to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, requiring that they support his policy to allow gays to serve openly in the military. He backtracked the next day.</p>
        <p>But that exception proves the rule. Increasingly, Mr. Gore likes to show he is in complete control. As he and Mr. Bradley were at their lecterns waiting for a debate to begin last October, Mr. Gore asked the audience, ''Anybody have a question?''</p>
        <p>Despite his command of the dialogue, Mr. Gore's body language tends toward the tense -- except when he is deliberately trying to look relaxed by putting his left hand in his pocket and wandering around the stage. More often than not, he opens with a planned surprise, offering his opponent some sort of deal -- a handshake to Mr. Bradley to eliminate television commercials, a joking suggestion to Mr. Kemp that if the former quarterback would refrain from using football metaphors, Mr. Gore would not mention ''any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement.''</p>
        <p>These moves -- his critics call them gimmicks -- have added to Mr. Gore's reputation as a master at flummoxing the other side, to great amusement in his 1993 debate with Ross Perot. To brand Mr. Perot as a protectionist, Mr. Gore pulled out a picture of Reed Smoot and Willis C. Hawley, the dreary-looking authors of a famously misguided tariff, the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act. He said he had it specially framed for Mr. Perot. Clearly irked, Mr. Perot grabbed the present and slammed it face down on his desk.</p>
        <p>William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard and Mr. Quayle's chief of staff, said that the best approach with Mr. Gore was to try to knock him off his script.</p>
        <p>''Gore is like one of these well-oiled machines,'' Mr. Kristol said. ''If you let him get going and pick up momentum, he's relentless and very hard to stop. If you can get him off his game early and disrupt his plans, he doesn't adjust terribly well.''</p>
        <p>In his least appealing moments, Mr. Gore can seem sanctimonious and condescending. He likes to show how much he knows. Some call it the Eddie Haskell effect; he appears to be the model student, pandering to the teacher, but when the teacher leaves the room, he turns around and annihilates his fellow students.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Gore, the wheels are always spinning, sometimes visibly. ''Let me take 10 seconds to finish my last answer,'' he frequently says. At a debate at Dartmouth College last fall, a woman asked Mr. Gore how to end school violence. ''Hmmmmmm,'' he said, as if hearing the question for the first time. ''Tell me about your family.''</p>
        <p>In an overt effort to connect with the audience, Mr. Gore made a small joke about her family (''One daughter 17 months old and a husband -- which one do you have more trouble with?'') but then jumped the rails: ''First, a brief comment on the latest exchange.'' The audience laughed. Mr. Gore's visage grew stern at the laughter and he held up his hand in a command to stop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore almost never makes gaffes or utters one-liners that work against him or, for that matter, are particularly memorable. His speech patterns, characterized by unfailingly formal syntax and multiple subordinate clauses, are generally too complex for that.</p>
        <p>This has spawned concern in the Gore camp that the vice president needs to figure out better how to speak to ''real people.'' Mr. Gore is rather showily not cramming for these face-offs. Instead, his campaign has set up ''debate camp'' here with 13 ordinary citizens he met along the campaign trail. They will serve, he said, as his ''sounding board'' and ''reality check.''</p>
        <p>The novel move is an implicit acknowledgment that Mr. Gore still has difficulty conveying his humanity to voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore tends to get lost in mind-numbing, eye-glazing detail. Aides said that having ''real people'' at practice sessions will help him focus on condensing his thoughts into easily digestible nuggets.</p>
        <p>And in what has become a Gore tradition, he expects to have them at the debate in Boston. Analysts trace his success in the Iowa caucuses this year to his display of Chris Peterson, an Iowa farmer and flood victim, at a forum in Des Moines where he questioned Mr. Bradley's commitment to farmers and Mr. Bradley appeared not to know his own record.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gore said the other day, he is hoping that his familiarity with issues -- and the fact that his positions are generally more popular with voters than Mr. Bush's are -- will win people over in a way that his personality might not.</p>
        <p>Asked if he was concerned he might win the debate on points and lose on style, Mr. Gore said: ''I think that it's the same question people ask about how people vote. Do they vote on the issues or on the person? Both. How do you separate them out? I mean, the way they think about somebody and they way they feel about somebody colors the way they interpret stands on the issues. But vice versa also -- the way the positions on the issues can have an impact on how they feel about somebody. So, I don't know. That's above my level of expertise. I just feel my way along.''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEBATES  Correction:  October 3, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Vice President Al Gore's performance in past debates referred incorrectly to strategy for the coming ones. It is Mr. Gore, not Gov. George W. Bush, who is trying to bat down the impression that the vice president is the more accomplished debater.</p>
