        <p>After Tennessee had rolled to a 21-0 first-half lead and the Giants had totaled as many turnovers (two) as first downs, after the Giants' offense and defense on too many instances looked stagnant, fractured and simply silly, the search began for slippery answers.</p>
        <p>Initially, these were among the options: A) The game began at noon Central time, but the Giants are used to 1 p.m. Eastern starts. Thus, they decided to show up only in body until after halftime. B) Tennessee has better players, better schemes, better coaches. C) The Giants' entire team suffered an off day. D) The Titans and Giants are built in similar fashion, but the Titans are a more refined version.</p>
        <p>Let's go with D.</p>
        <p>When the Giants gained an up-close look at last season's American Football Conference champion and Super Bowl entrant yesterday, it was like watching a highlight film of old-time Giants football. Once upon a time the Giants were this rugged, physical, beat-you-down team that featured power running and big-play defense. Those Super Bowl champion Giants could take the ball from your team and keep it for long drives that milked the clock and wore you down. Way down.</p>
        <p>You would look up at the scoreboard and although little spectacular had happened -- just a methodical tail kicking that left you bruised -- the Giants would have a two- or three-touchdown lead and, eventually, an easy victory.</p>
        <p>That was National Football Conference East division football, Giants style.</p>
        <p>Hello. What a retro game for the Giants here today in Adelphia Coliseum. What a misty-eyed awakening. The Giants found a team that does everything the way they used to do it, with equal effectiveness, with equal punch.</p>
        <p>It was a 28-14 loss for the Giants that hurt and signaled something much larger.</p>
        <p>Little wonder that when Jeff Fisher, the Tennessee coach, was asked last week about playing the Giants, he said something about their being a power-running team that takes occasional shots downfield and lets its defense do the grunt work.</p>
        <p>Fisher said his team was familiar with that style because that was the way the Titans play. So, Giants-Titans equaled who could get the first hit, the second hit, the third one and the last one on each series. It was a simple game based on which team  execute its run-oriented offense and which team could play the more destructive defense.</p>
        <p>Advantage Titans, on all counts.</p>
        <p>This was the Giants' first half on offense: The first three possessions were three plays and a punt. The fourth gained one first down and ended with a fumble. The fifth was one first down and an interception. One rushing yard gained the entire half.</p>
        <p>This was the Giants' first half on defense: Eighteen first downs allowed and an 82 percent third-down conversion rate (9 of 11). Touchdown drives of 80, 98 and 80 yards. The 98-yard drive included 19 plays and took nearly 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>It was shameful. The halftime numbers were so gaudy for the Titans and so rueful for the Giants that this had elements of Miami versus Rutgers on Saturday (Miami 64, Rutgers 6).</p>
        <p>And the Giants knew it.</p>
        <p>''They did what they wanted to do against us, and did it well,'' safety Sam Garnes said. ''I didn't see them missing tackles and dropping balls like we did; they did what good teams do and we had no answer for them. They called off the dogs; we didn't do anything to stop them or to put on a good show. We went out there and at times lost our confidence as a team. That 98-yard drive was disgusting.''</p>
        <p>Linebacker Jessie Armstead, the defensive captain, said: ''We all had our hands in it. We all could have played better. I am one of the leaders of the defense and I played flat. The captain can't play flat. The main thing was the third-down plays; you've got to make those and get off the field. We've got to take this whipping; that's what I consider it.''</p>
        <p>Guess so. Lomas Brown, one of the Giants tackles, said he hardly broke a sweat, especially in the first half, because his offense was on the field so infrequently. Conversely, Titans defensive end Kenny Holmes said he didn't ''feel that banged up, and that's how I know they didn't try to run a whole lot on us.''</p>
        <p>The Titans decided from the outset that neither Tiki Barber (five carries, 2 yards) nor Ron Dayne (three carries, minus-1 yard) was going to beat them on the ground. It took the Giants a half to spread the field and make a few plays in the passing game.</p>
        <p>And think about it -- the Giants did win the second half, 14-7.</p>
        <p>So, this was not all about personnel. It was not all about talent or depth.</p>
        <p>This game, as are most pro football games, was about mind-set. About focus and confidence. The Giants showed little of those traits, and this is exactly the kind of performance that will get their coach, Jim Fassel, fired. That is the larger signal. That in a game in which the Giants were reeling from a subpar performance against Washington, they melted here and were so unfocused, ineffective, timid and sloppy. Whatever Fassel and his staff did to prepare the Giants for this game and whatever changes were made during the free fall first half all fell horribly short.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Fassel said his biggest concern entering this game was special-teams play. He thought that could be decisive. Whoa! Not even close. There proved to be bigger holes, bigger worries, much larger headaches. Fassel and his staff  missed that point against a team that reached the Super Bowl last season, a team that had never lost a game in this stadium. How could the Giants be so unprepared mentally for such a challenge?</p>
        <p>The Titans talked long afterward about their comfort level in this game, how every down seemed like first-and-1 and how they ran the same play four or five times in a row because it worked. That is ridiculous. Football at this level is not supposed to be that easy.</p>
        <p>Unless, of course, you are the new model of an old formula that works.</p>
        <p>That would be the Titans.</p>
        <p>The Giants? Time for deep thinking, deep tinkering and a probing tune-up, from the top down.</p>
