        <p>APBnews.com plans to post on its Web site documents from Federal Bureau of Investigation's long probe of Playboy Magazine, spurred by Hugh M Hefner's Feb 1963 criticism of then FBI head J Edgar Hoover; Hoover assigned agents to monitor magazine's articles (M)</p>

        <p>Remember when the F.B.I. agent portrayed on television by Efrem Zimbalist Jr. on the ABC-TV show ''F.B.I.'' was chasing Communists and crooks? At the same time, some of his real-life counterparts had considerably more cushy duty. Their job was reading every word of Playboy Magazine, then offering miniversions of social commentary and media criticism, addressed principally to J. Edgar Hoover.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoover, the former F.B.I. director, was so stung by Hugh M. Hefner's February 1963 criticisms of his antipornography pronouncements that he wrote his top subordinates, ''What do we know of H. M.

        <p>Remember when the F.B.I. agent portrayed on television by Efrem Zimbalist Jr. on the ABC-TV show ''F.B.I.'' was chasing Communists and crooks? At the same time, some of his real-life counterparts had considerably more cushy duty. Their job was reading every word of Playboy Magazine, then offering miniversions of social commentary and media criticism, addressed principally to J. Edgar Hoover.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoover, the former F.B.I. director, was so stung by Hugh M. Hefner's February 1963 criticisms of his antipornography pronouncements that he wrote his top subordinates, ''What do we know of H. M. Hefner?'' according to one of 230 F.B.I. documents discovered by the Web site APBnews.com under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
        <p>APBnews.com is on life support after being bought out of bankruptcy  by the closely held SafetyTips .com for $575,000 four weeks ago. It will post the documents tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The documents -- compiled from 1963 to 1972 -- show that long before sound bites were a concept, the agents had mastered the art as they offered Mr. Hoover their take on the writers and subjects of Playboy articles. Martin Luther King Jr.? ''A false prophet.'' The entertainer Lenny Bruce? ''A foul-mouthed so-called comedian.'' The civil libertarian Nat Hentoff? ''A bore.''</p>
        <p>A 1964 Playboy profile of the pugnacious lawyer Melvin Belli prompted an agent to deride Mr. Belli as ''a two-bit, Barnum &amp; Bailey barrister,'' and say, ''This is a case where the director and the bureau can well be proud of its enemies.'' Mr. Hoover wrote in the margin, ''Playboy has sunk to a new low.''</p>
        <p>That particular summary was classified top secret, according to James Gordon Meek, the Washington bureau chief of APBnews.com, who discussed the material in an interview on Friday.</p>
        <p>The files also contain letters to the bureau from citizens who suspected the magazine harbored communist journalists and letters from the magazine requesting Mr. Hoover's comment for some article or other. The latter usually contained a note in the margin: ''Ignore. H.''</p>
        <p>Yet just as not every movie or book is worth reviewing, not every issue of Playboy elicited trenchant commentary from the bureau, Mr. Meek said. Many issues were reviewed briefly by agents who noted, in roughly these words, ''There were various pictures of nude and seminude women, but no mention of the director or the F.B.I.''</p>
