        <p>The Giants' once-hopeful season hit a jolting wall of realism this afternoon. With each failure by their offense and with each successful third-down conversion by the Tennessee Titans, the Giants' early-season success appeared a mirage.</p>
        <p>The Giants' players were left to wonder just how good they are after a 28-14 loss today left them with a 3-2 record after a 3-0 start. They sounded confused in explaining an afternoon full of alarming truths.</p>
        <p>Why has their offense regressed to its stagnant 1999 form? What happened to the running game that led the National Football League in rushing before today's game? Why was the defense outplayed and unable to stop Tennessee's predictable offense on third downs?</p>
        <p>''We all had our hands in this,'' Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead said.</p>
        <p>There was little rationalizing after the Giants' 16-6 loss last Sunday night to the Washington Redskins, a defeat the players blamed on two or three breakdowns. Today there was a litany of failure.</p>
        <p>''Right now, we certainly look like a mediocre team that's going to go 8-8,'' guard Glenn Parker said. ''That doesn't mean we can't pick ourselves up from our bootstraps and win a few more games, and people are saying this team can be 10-6 or 12-4.''</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel, who erupted after his players were lackadaisical in a practice last Thursday, made an urgent plea today for his team to save its season while there was still time.</p>
        <p>''We have to make up our minds right now where we're going,'' Fassel said. ''We started off with a lot of confidence so to speak, and we played that way. The last few games we haven't played that way.''</p>
        <p>How the team reacts to that challenge will be seen Sunday in Atlanta, but the Giants did nothing today to scare the Falcons.</p>
        <p>''After Atlanta watches the film, they're going to be licking their chops,'' Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most troubling was the observation made by Giants quarterback Kerry Collins that the team lacked confidence and had become passive after the quick start.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we got a little full of ourselves the first three games and now we're just waiting for it all to happen instead of going out and making it happen,'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>Tennessee won its 10th straight regular-season game here since Adelphia Coliseum opened last season, setting an N.F.L. record to open a new stadium.</p>
        <p>The 68,341 fans present had little doubt which team was dominant today. The Titans (3-1) used a nine-play drive to go 80 yards and score on their first possession, setting the tone for the game. Playing from behind for the second straight week, the Giants' offense was invisible.</p>
        <p>The Giants managed only nine plays on their first three possessions and did not record a first down until 2 minutes 39 seconds were left in the first half. They controlled the ball for only 17:14, the shortest recorded time of possession in the past 20 years.</p>
        <p>The defense could not get the Titans off the field. Tennessee converted 9 of 11 third-down opportunities in the first half, including all six on a 19-play, 98-yard drive that culminated with running back Eddie George rushing 7 yards for a touchdown and a 14-0 Titans lead. The Titans started the drive from the 2-yard line after Ron Dixon prevented a Giants punt from entering the end zone.</p>
        <p>That drive gobbled up 9:53.</p>
        <p>The Titans used another long drive to produce their third touchdown, a 29-yard pass from Steve McNair to Derrick Mason. Tennessee led, 21-0, at halftime and kept the Giants' defense on the field for 24:17 of the first 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>Armstead, the leader of a defense that had held opponents to a National Football Conference-low 64.3 yards rushing a game before today, was extremely self-critical.</p>
        <p>''Me, being a captain, I played flat,'' said Armstead, who did not know the reason for it. ''If a main guy on our defense plays flat, it trickles down to the next guy.''</p>
        <p>George became the first back to gain 100 yards against the Giants this season, rushing for 125 yards on 35 carries. Significantly, the Titans have won the past 15 games when George has had at least 27 carries.</p>
        <p>Also disconcerting for the Giants was allowing a season-high 436 yards to a team that had outscored opponents by only 3 points.</p>
        <p>The Titans need to run to win, but they apparently watched Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson dissect the Giants' secondary last week and used McNair to throw more often today. McNair was one of the lowest-rated N.F.L. passers for yardage entering the game and his 293 passing yards today were only 7 fewer than he had in his previous three games. He completed 24 of 35 passes for 3 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>The Titans used the same basic play to repeatedly hurt the Giants. McNair would roll out of the pocket and find a receiver on the left side just far enough downfield for a first down. Eighteen of the Titans' first downs came by passing.</p>
        <p>''Not to take anything away from them, but when they throw a 10-yard pass to the tight end, it makes it a little easier,'' Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn said. ''It's hard to make mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Third down is when defenses are supposed to rise, Armstead said, not crumble as the Giants did. Tennessee converted 14 of 20 third-down opportunities.</p>
        <p>''It felt like they knew what we were doing,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Tennessee's top two receivers are out with injuries, but the Titans compensated by using Mason, the kick returner, on offense. He had six receptions for 103 yards, his first 100-yard game as a professional.</p>
        <p>Fassel declined to blame the defense's woes on middle linebacker Mike Barrow's absence. Barrow missed most of the second and third quarters with a pinched nerve in his neck.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the offensive strategy again did not resemble the wide-open attack the Giants promised in training camp. The running game, crucial to the Giants' first three victories, had 1 yard at halftime and finished with 24 yards. Tiki Barber carried only once before halftime and finished with 2 yards on 5 carries. Ron Dayne carried three times for minus-1 yard. Collins was the Giants' leading rusher with 19 yards.</p>
        <p>''From Monday, we told ourselves we weren't going to let them run the ball,'' Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse said before taking a dig at Barber's and Dayne's nickname. ''They were bragging about Thunder and Lightning. We knew they were going to try to run the ball. Our objective was to make them beat us passing the ball.''</p>
        <p>Collins completed 17 of 36 passes for 197 yards and was intercepted three times. It was the first time the Giants were shut out in the first halves of consecutive games since 1980.</p>
        <p>When the Giants finally scored in the third quarter, the drive was fueled by two Titans penalties for 40 yards. Collins's 14-yard pass to Ike Hilliard (4 catches, 59 yards) cut the deficit to 21-7, but Tennessee then used a 14-play, 80-yard drive to demoralize its opponent.</p>
        <p>''I'm searching for answers but I'm not finding any right now,'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>He then repeated ''We'll get it right'' three times, as if trying to convince himself.</p>
