        <p>Le Grande Danseur, a 2-year-old colt who won his debut at Saratoga four weeks ago by three-and-three-quarter lengths, won his second straight race in dramatic fashion yesterday: He rallied from last place, swept five-wide on the turn for home and won the Bertram F. Bongard at Blemont Park by five-and-three-quarter lengths over the favorite, Backstreet Blues.</p>
        <p>Jorge Chavez, the jockey on Le Grande Danseur, said with some wonder: ''He just turned sideways at the start. He started to move up on the far turn, and I knew I had a ton of horse.''</p>

        <p>Le Grande Danseur, a 2-year-old colt who won his debut at Saratoga four weeks ago by three-and-three-quarter lengths, won his second straight race in dramatic fashion yesterday: He rallied from last place, swept five-wide on the turn for home and won the Bertram F. Bongard at Blemont Park by five-and-three-quarter lengths over the favorite, Backstreet Blues.</p>
        <p>Jorge Chavez, the jockey on Le Grande Danseur, said with some wonder: ''He just turned sideways at the start. He started to move up on the far turn, and I knew I had a ton of horse.''</p>
        <p>Dominic Galluscio, who trains the colt for the Team Five Star Stable, sounded just as impressed, saying: ''I couldn't believe the start he had. I've worked so hard with him coming into this race, and thought he lost all chance.''</p>
        <p>Le Grande Danseur trailed the field of eight after a quarter-mile, and was running seventh after a half-mile, with only three-eighths to go. Then he shot wide as they entered the one stretch while Backstreet Blues made his usual late run. But at the finish Le Grande Danseur was ahead by nearly six lengths, trailed by Backstreet Blues and Native Rhythm.</p>
        <p>The winner ran the seven furlongs in 1:23 4/5 and paid $10 for a $2 bet. Jerry Bailey, the rider on Backstreet Blues, said his colt had run well, but added, ''The winner ran a huge race.''</p>
