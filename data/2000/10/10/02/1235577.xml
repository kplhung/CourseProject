        <p>Ian Thorpe, the young Australian with size- 17 flippers for feet, led a charge of high- promise swimmers into the Sydney Games. And they did not disappoint. In all, 15 world records were set in the 32 events. Fast pools, fast suits and drug use were among the reasons offered for such an increase in swimming performances.</p>
        <p>Pieter van den Hoogenband and Inge de Bruijn from the Netherlands joined Thorpe in leading the swimmers in Sydney to better times than the swimmers four years ago in 29 of the 31 events held in both Games. By contrast, the swimmers in the Atlanta Games only managed to better the swimmers from Barcelona in 11 of the 31 events.</p>

        <p>Ian Thorpe, the young Australian with size- 17 flippers for feet, led a charge of high- promise swimmers into the Sydney Games. And they did not disappoint. In all, 15 world records were set in the 32 events. Fast pools, fast suits and drug use were among the reasons offered for such an increase in swimming performances.</p>
        <p>Pieter van den Hoogenband and Inge de Bruijn from the Netherlands joined Thorpe in leading the swimmers in Sydney to better times than the swimmers four years ago in 29 of the 31 events held in both Games. By contrast, the swimmers in the Atlanta Games only managed to better the swimmers from Barcelona in 11 of the 31 events.</p>
        <p>But Ray Stefani, Ph.D., cautions that the swimmers in Sydney, although a formidable group, have merely returned their Olympic sport to a rate of performance increase approaching that which has been seen throughout the modern Games.</p>
        <p>Swimming times have decreased an average of 2.2 percent for each Olympics over the last century. During the 2000 Games the performances were better by 1.3 percent. Stefani, an Olympic historian and statistical analyst, points out that the Atlanta performances were the only Olympics in which swimming as a whole was down from the previous Games (-- 0.2 percent). It was a continuation of less-than-normal increases that began in 1980. The boycotts of the '80 and '84 Games and the dismantling of Communism, which stripped money, athletes and coaches from the Olympic effort, were all factors that reduced the rate of improvement over the last 20 years.</p>
