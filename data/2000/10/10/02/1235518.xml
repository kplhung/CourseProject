        <p>HOLLYWOOD'S ambassador to Washington, Jack Valenti, said he was ready to quit back in 1992.

        <p>HOLLYWOOD'S ambassador to Washington, Jack Valenti, said he was ready to quit back in 1992. Warner Brothers had released Oliver Stone's ''J.F.K.,'' which half-suggested that the assassination of President Kennedy was carried out on the orders of his vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, Mr. Valenti's political patron and hero.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti, who left the Johnson White House in 1966 to run the Motion Picture Association of America, said he was warned to keep his mouth shut, that it would be improper for him to attack a Hollywood film. ''And I said, you know something, you're right; therefore I'm going to call a meeting of the board of directors and resign,'' he recalled telling one studio executive. The executive backed off, and Mr. Valenti went public, describing ''J.F.K.'' as a ''hoax'' and comparing it to Nazi propaganda.</p>
        <p>''I hated it,'' the 79-year-old lobbyist said. ''A tissue of lies.'' But should it have been censored, blocked from theaters? Of course not, said Mr. Valenti, who finds himself at the center of a new whirlwind over censorship and the film industry, this one whipped up by a government study over the marketing of R-rated films to children.</p>
        <p>''It's the price you pay for freedom,'' said the advertising man turned White House speechwriter turned film-industry spokesman. ''The price you pay for it is this slime. You have to allow tawdry, meretricious, soiling, loathsome, even unwholesome stuff into the marketplace.''</p>
        <p>It is a line of argument that has been heard often from Mr. Valenti in the weeks since the Federal Trade Commission released its report on the marketing of violent and sexually explicit films to young people. The commission uncovered internal documents showing that violent R-rated films had been test-marketed to 9-year-olds.</p>
        <p>Facing outrage on Capitol Hill, the Motion Picture Association hurriedly announced a program to restrict marketing R-rated films, including a pledge not to use children under 17 in screenings for films rated R for violence, unless they were accompanied by an adult. ''I think some of the transgressions that are obvious are not going to be committed again,'' Mr. Valenti said.</p>
        <p>But he is clearly less distressed by the failings of his industry than his critics had hoped.  In the age of the Internet and satellite television, he suggests, there is little the film industry can do to protect children beyond the ratings system (now G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17) that Mr. Valenti created in 1968.</p>
        <p>''It's a new world,'' he said with the drawl of his native Texas but the lofty rhetorical style of a man who likes to quote Churchill and Lord Macaulay. ''The walls have been breached. Tell me, with hundreds of channels of satellite television and 1,100 over-the-air television stations, how can you advertise anywhere some children aren't going to be watching?''</p>
        <p>PARENTS, he said, must take responsibility. ''If parents feebly perform the duty of parenting, if they have a casual regard for where their children go to school, what they read, what they listen to, what they watch, then no ratings system -- and by the way, no law -- is going to be able to deal with that,'' he said. ''If this moral shield breaks down, do you want the Federal Trade Commission to tell you how to raise your kids? I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>The road that brought Mr. Valenti to Washington began in Dallas, on the one that carried President Kennedy's motorcade on the day of his assassination in November 1963.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti, whose Houston advertising firm had been hired for the president's visit to Texas, was a few cars behind Kennedy when shots rang out. Within hours, Mr. Valenti was on Air Force One, hired on the spot by Mr. Johnson as a special assistant. In the famous photograph of Mr. Johnson's airborne swearing-in, Mr. Valenti can be seen next to a bloodstained Jacqueline Kennedy.</p>
        <p>He married another Johnson aide, Mary Margaret Wiley, and together they have three children, one a Warner Brothers executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti graduated from high school in Houston at the age of 15. He joined the Army Air Corps and flew 51 combat missions as a B-25 bomber pilot in World War II, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross. A model of a B-25 sits atop a coffee table in his spacious Washington office, dominated at one end by a large photograph of Kirk Douglas (''my closest, dearest friend'') from the 1960 film ''Spartacus.''</p>
        <p>A physical fitness fanatic, Mr. Valenti has the compact body of a welterweight and last year earned a black belt in tae kwon do. He works out daily in a home gym, watching films on a large-screen television as he exercises. Recent showings: ''Erin Brockovich'' with Julia Roberts (''terrific,'' he said) and ''The Matrix'' with Keanu Reeves (his review, after a pause, ''very good.'').</p>
        <p>At an age at which most people would crave retirement, Mr. Valenti continues to enjoy the spotlight as much as many of the film stars he escorts around Washington on their visits from Hollywood.</p>
        <p>With his silver mane, impeccably tailored suits and trademark cowboy boots, he is perhaps the city's best-known lobbyist -- and among the most courted by lawmakers, if only because he controls the guest list to the association's 70-seat screening room two blocks from the White House. The invitations are among the most prized in Washington.</p>
        <p>He has an ''evergreen'' contract for a salary of more than $1 million a year, renewed automatically unless the studios decide otherwise. Mr. Valenti laughed at the widely published rumor that President Clinton, a film buff, might want the job in a few months. ''I'm not going anywhere,'' he said. ''I say this -- with great thrill and gratitude -- that not one chief executive has ever said, 'Jack, how long are you going to serve?' They don't even ask me that.''</p>
