        <p>Vice President Al Gore, who is known as one of the most ferocious debaters in American politics, said today that he would try a new tack -- and tone -- in his first televised encounter with Gov.

        <p>Vice President Al Gore, who is known as one of the most ferocious debaters in American politics, said today that he would try a new tack -- and tone -- in his first televised encounter with Gov. George W. Bush: keep the focus on his own proposals and try to resist savaging his opponent.</p>
        <p>Strolling in his bare feet along the beach in this resort community on the Gulf Coast near Sarasota, where he is preparing for the first general election debate, on Tuesday, Mr. Gore said he expected to spew facts and figures -- as he did at the Democratic convention -- and not barbs at Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking at this one differently,'' Mr. Gore said in an interview that was repeatedly interrupted by well-wishers ambling up to him as the surf rolled in gently. ''I'll be communicating less on him and more on the people watching. That will be my single-minded focus.''</p>
        <p>That focus is intended to blunt what Mr. Gore's advisers say may be his greatest liability in debates: he can come across as badgering and even mean-spirited.</p>
        <p>By inviting two reporters to walk with him on the beach, Mr. Gore was clearly trying to convey that he was in high spirits, and at ease with his debate preparations. In saying that his strategy would be positive and future-oriented, the vice president also might have been trying to throw off Mr. Bush as he prepared at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.</p>
        <p>Whatever the intention, Mr. Gore seemed to enjoy his late morning constitutional. He chuckled at the contrast between his gray shorts and polo shirt and the suit and wingtips Richard M. Nixon wore when he, famously, walked the beach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore looked so much like he was on holiday that one woman asked, ''Are you just on vacation?''</p>
        <p>''No, I've been preparing for the debates,'' Mr. Gore responded, laughing heartily and stretching out his arms. ''Can't you tell?''</p>
        <p>Another beachgoer, Mort Goodman, handed the vice president a sealed envelope with the words, ''Memo For Debate Enclosed.'' That prompted Mr. Gore to say, ''This is better than finding seashells! Thank you.''</p>
        <p>There was such an outpouring from bystanders that Mr. Gore observed, ''I'm beginning to think we planted these people.''</p>
        <p>In seeking to break from his past as a basher in debates, Mr. Gore said that when he contrasted himself with Mr. Bush, he would focus more on their substantive differences, particularly the Texas governor's tax-cut plan. He said he would be less inclined to reach back and disparage  Mr. Bush's record in Texas, although the Democrats were doing that in television commercials.</p>
        <p>''I will talk less about his Texas record and more about proposals that are relevant to the future -- his and mine,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I'll spend most of my time talking about mine.''</p>
        <p>Another incentive for Mr. Gore to stick to issues, his aides said, was that polls showed that his positions were relatively popular while Mr. Bush's strength was his personality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he was buoyed by the response to his policy-laden speech at the Democratic National Convention, and he seemed comfortable with the idea that his selling point was his command of issues. ''As I said at the convention,'' he said, ''the presidency is not a popularity contest.''</p>
        <p>Asked if it was hard to compete on personality with the affable Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore was not about to concede anything, saying, ''It's in the ear, and eye, of the beholder.''</p>
        <p>Contending that Americans have had enough of ''sound bites and generalities,'' Mr. Gore said he did not expect to arrive in Boston on Tuesday armed with a batch of one-liners or ploys -- as in the primaries when he challenged Bill Bradley to eliminate television commercials. ''I'm not planning any gimmicks,'' Mr. Gore said. ''If something comes up that looks like a gimmick, you'll know it's spontaneous.''</p>
        <p>He did have a spontaneous outburst on the beach, when he met two little boys, one named Dylan and the other Wesley. He asked their father, Allan Gottesman of Tampa, if he was a fan of Bob Dylan, and began singing Mr. Dylan's song ''John Wesley Harding.'' Yes, the father said, the boys were named for Mr. Dylan and his song.</p>
        <p>As part of his campaign to show that he was of good cheer and more interested in the people than in his opponent, Mr. Gore was the host of a brunch of shrimp salad with 13 ''real people'' his campaign flew down here to watch him in a mock debate today and offer their tips. One of them, Matt Moseley, an Atlanta firefighter, advised Mr. Gore: ''Just have a conversation like we are. I don't envy you a bit trying to find that balancing between, I guess, the more technical side of the debate and the human side of the debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides said they recognized that in citing policy the vice president could come off as pedantic, not to say dull. When Mr. Gore ran through a practice debate Saturday night and again today, one aide said, a goal was to help him ''explain these complex policy ideas'' in a reasonable amount of time and ''do it in human terms.''</p>
        <p>While he tried to convey a sense of openness in the interview, Mr. Gore was guarded in discussing how he was preparing for the debate and how he viewed his sparring partner.</p>
        <p>The vice president seemed to jump to Mr. Bush's defense when asked about how the governor sometimes mispronounced words, saying, ''I think more is made of it than should be made of it.''</p>
        <p>Despite the display on the beach and the consultation with ordinary people, Mr. Gore retreated to serious practice sessions with a vanload of advisers. It was not lost on Mr. Gore that a stuffed shark graced their practice room at the Mote Marine Laboratory in nearby Sarasota. Yet even as he tried to play down his fiercely competitive nature, there was no doubt that he and his advisers were preparing for what could be a bitter encounter. Suggesting that the be-nice-to-Bush strategy could be canned in an instant, one aide who was advising Mr. Gore here said, ''If he whacks us, we're not going to sit and take it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore certainly must have appreciated the spirited words of Allison Frankel, 24, of Chapel Hill, N.C., when she walked up to him on the beach: ''We expect you to kick some butt.'' Mindful, perhaps, that he not sound too primed for battle, Mr. Gore replied, simply, ''I appreciate your best wishes.''</p>
