        <p>As Serbia's opposition vowed to shut the country down on Monday, several hundred policemen, apparently sent to try to keep electricity production going, tonight surrounded and entered an important coal mine that went on strike on Friday.</p>
        <p>The strike is part of the opposition's campaign to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede defeat in the Sept. 24 elections to the challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. The coal mine supplies an electrical power station at Obrenovac, which produces up to half of Serbia's electricity in a system patched together after NATO bombing campaign last year. At least 4,500 coal workers are on strike, and the general manager of part of the mine, Slobodan Jankovic, resigned earlier today, throwing his support to the workers.</p>

        <p>As Serbia's opposition vowed to shut the country down on Monday, several hundred policemen, apparently sent to try to keep electricity production going, tonight surrounded and entered an important coal mine that went on strike on Friday.</p>
        <p>The strike is part of the opposition's campaign to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede defeat in the Sept. 24 elections to the challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. The coal mine supplies an electrical power station at Obrenovac, which produces up to half of Serbia's electricity in a system patched together after NATO bombing campaign last year. At least 4,500 coal workers are on strike, and the general manager of part of the mine, Slobodan Jankovic, resigned earlier today, throwing his support to the workers.</p>
        <p>Citizens of Lazarevac, about 40 miles southwest of Belgrade, and relatives of the workers began to march toward the nearby mine, but the police did not let them through. An opposition politician, Nebojsa Covic, was negotiating with the police, who also blocked the road from Belgrade, checking identities of those traveling toward the mine.</p>
        <p>On state television news, the country's electricity company also appealed to the workers not to deprive hospitals and schools of electricity and said it would restrict supplies.</p>
        <p>The opposition is trying to organize what would be the first general strike in Yugoslavia since World War II.</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders said they hoped that their strategy of legal challenges mixed with popular pressure would be enough to persuade Mr. Milosevic and his allies to concede his loss of the presidency.</p>
        <p>''Monday is a crucial day, when schools won't work, students and teachers come onto the streets, the shops and cafes won't work and a great majority of Belgrade will block traffic,'' vowed Zoran Djindjic, a leader of the democratic opposition coalition. ''Tomorrow will be a day when Belgrade comes to a halt.''</p>
        <p>The opposition hopes to block major roads all over Serbia, to cut off refineries and electrical stations, to shut down schools and especially public offices and ministries, all to try to show to Mr. Milosevic that he can no longer command the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica says that he won the presidential elections outright with more than 50 percent of the vote, and that Mr. Milosevic and his Federal Election Commission organized electoral fraud to justify a second-round runoff next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica has vowed to boycott the second round as unnecessary. He has challenged the election commission's results in the Constitutional Court after a lower appeal was rejected and has urged Greece and Russia to mediate the electoral dispute and recount the votes.</p>
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, after talks with French, German and American officials, offered to send Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov to Belgrade, but Mr. Milosevic rejected the offer, according to American officials briefed on a conversation between Mr. Putin and President Clinton. Russia has been an important Milosevic ally, helpful with energy, credits and other support.</p>
        <p>But today German officials said Mr. Putin had agreed with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany in a telephone call on Saturday that Mr. Kostunica had won the election. There was no confirmation from Moscow of this view, which would mark a major defeat for Mr. Milosevic in his effort to persuade his own people that he was not defeated outright by Mr. Kostunica. Two senior Russian diplomats arrived in Belgrade late Saturday for talks with government and opposition leaders.</p>
        <p>Some opposition leaders believe that the pressure beginning on Monday must work quickly on the government, forcing a confrontation between the people and the police and fracturing the ruling circle before a second round next Sunday. If the strategy fails, however, there is the possibility of asking voters to come out again on Sunday to prevent a Milosevic victory by default.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica cannot easily reverse himself, but his name will appear on the ballot in any case. It is possible, the opposition leaders say, that the Serbian Orthodox Church, which has already recognized Mr. Kostunica as the first-round victor, could ask people to vote.</p>
        <p>A Serbian expert, Aleksa Djilas, says he believes that Mr. Kostunica's rejection of a second round is a mistake. ''If people vote again, Milosevic would surely lose, and such a huge fraud to win would be obvious and unlikely, and if it were that big, the wrath of the people would be enormous,'' Mr. Djilas said. ''A boycott induces passivity. Why not say, 'Let's drive it home -- we are not afraid.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic tends to give in to the inevitable to save himself when other options are foreclosed, as he did to end the war in Kosovo, said Mr. Djilas, who is now at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.</p>
        <p>While there is enormous anxiety in the governing coalition, with officials coming to their offices only to talk or calling in sick, there have been few signs of an open break with Mr. Milosevic. On Friday, he responded harshly at a Socialist Party meeting to suggestions that he concede to Mr. Kostunica, officials say, and his sudden visit on Saturday to a graduation ceremony at a military academy, with his two top generals, was perceived as a warning that he would not go without a fight.</p>
        <p>At the same time, even official figures show Mr. Milosevic trailing Mr. Kostunica by more than 10 percentage points, and his aura as an elected president has been badly tainted. Even officials who are careful now say it is unlikely that he can remain president long.</p>
        <p>They speak of a scenario where Mr. Milosevic concedes to Mr. Kostunica but remains in office until January or even June, then appoints himself federal prime minister, since his coalition controls the federal Parliament. Others believe that once Mr. Milosevic concedes, it is winner take all, and that even his allies will move to Mr. Kostunica.</p>
        <p>State media are beginning to crack. More than 60 reporters at Vecernje Novosti, a popular tabloid the state took over in March, have signed a petition demanding a return to balanced news coverage within 24 hours. In an open letter, they demanded that the paper ''stop linking itself to the interests of a narrow political party or person, but only to the truth and the will of the people as expressed in the elections.''</p>
        <p>There is a similar petition at the Belgrade radio, part of the state system. Eight local radio stations said they would also stop broadcasting state news.</p>
        <p>There have been abundant rumors that Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic; their son, Marko; and daughter, Marija, left the country to go to Russia. But they are here, officials said. Ms. Markovic appeared on state television news tonight to denounce the West for trying ''to produce hatred that will push people into civil war.''</p>
