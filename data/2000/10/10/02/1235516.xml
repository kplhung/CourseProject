        <p>The handoff looked seamless. On the stage of Stadium Australia tonight, the Olympic flag passed from Sydney to Athens.</p>
        <p>But it was more than a ceremonial transition, a simple, required transfer from the host city of the just-completed Summer Games to the host city of the 2004 Summer Olympics. Rather, it was a passage from a city that executed a near-perfect organization and execution of the Olympics to a city that is catching up on three years of inertia since winning the 2004 bid.</p>
        <p>Athens fell so far behind earlier this year that Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said that the Greek city's bid was so troubled by construction delays that it was in danger of heading into a red light ''danger zone.''</p>
        <p>And just before the Sydney Games began, Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. member who is overseeing the Athens committee's work, said simply: ''The clock is ticking.''</p>
        <p>Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, a lawyer and a former member of the Greek parliament, knows the minutes are racing by and the comparisons with Sydney are inevitable. She ran the Athens bid, returned to private life for three years, but when the disorganization of her successors placed the bid in jeopardy, she stepped in as president of the organizing committee at Samaranch's request.</p>
        <p>Before taking the job, which has inevitably led to daily scrutiny by the Greek news media, she demanded to report to the prime minister of Greece, not to subordinate government officials.</p>
        <p>''I've had to apologize for things I was not involved in,'' she said in a small conference room 30 floors above Sydney Harbor, hours before today's closing ceremony.</p>
        <p>''Everything I do is about credibility now,'' she said. ''I want to show we're ready to meet the needs of the Olympic family. My first three and a half months have been very productive. We've gotten things back on track. But there's no minute to say, 'Relax, O.K.?' We'll relax when it's over.''</p>
        <p>Now, all she has to do is revive hope that Athens will be ready well before August 2004 -- and do nothing to inspire fears that Athens could be replaced by an experienced Summer Olympic city like Seoul, South Korea, Los Angeles or Sydney. ''I'm not distracted by fear or rumor,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A new airport is opening soon, as is an extension to the city's metro train system. Greece recently signed a bilateral security agreement with the United States and expects to enter into similar arrangements with other countries. Angelopoulos-Daskalaki insisted that security and terrorism will not be a problem for Athens. ''We have a very low crime rate,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But she declined to say if she would import any of Sydney's logistical and creative talent to Athens, such as the security chief, to guarantee a level of Olympic expertise that she and her committee lack. All she said is that ''people from host cities always help future host cities.''</p>
        <p>To be with Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, even briefly, is to sense that she would prefer not to dwell much on Sydney's success or brook suggestions that Athens must top Sydney's Games, which Samaranch proclaimed the ''best ever.''</p>
        <p>''Sydney was fantastic,'' she said. ''I'm impressed with the coordination. Everything was coordinated to be on time. They moved huge numbers of people beautifully. They had live sites around the city to attract people. It's been a joyful, happy Olympics.''</p>
        <p>She led a 130-person contingent from Athens, examining how the sites for the Games in Sydney, news media and broadcast centers, and security worked. She sat in on the meetings between Sydney 2000 and I.O.C. officials.</p>
        <p>Athens, she said, does not have to be Sydney to be successful. Just the somber flag handover ceremony -- featuring the ''priestesses of Olympia'' enacting rituals of ancient Greece -- showed a city's mind-set that is far different from Sydney's ''Let's Party'' theme for the closing ceremony. ''There will be cycling around the Acropolis, and the marathon will be run on the ancient course,'' she said. ''We're going to show the world a state-of-the art games and our ancient heritage.''</p>
