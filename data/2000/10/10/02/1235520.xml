        <p>Like a lot of friends gathering on a Sunday to watch a big game, the Yankees surrounded a television in their clubhouse here this evening. But they were all dressed in coats and slacks and ready to travel. The outcome of the games would determine where they would start the playoffs.</p>
        <p>A few of them whooped when the Athletics' Jason Isringhausen finished off the Texas Rangers; the Yankees knew they were on their way to Oakland for the first two games of their three-of-five division series. ''O.K., let's head out,'' said David Szen, the traveling secretary, and the players quickly left.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will work out in Oakland Monday, and on Tuesday, Roger Clemens will start against Oakland's Gil Heredia at 8 p.m., Eastern time. On Wednesday, Andy Pettitte is expected to pitch against Kevin Appier. The two teams will have a day off Thursday, then resume the series Friday at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees lost their final game of the regular season yesterday, 7-3 to Baltimore. They are the first team in baseball history to go into the postseason with a losing streak as long as seven games. Their collapse ruined any chance of opening the playoffs at home. Oakland is generally viewed as dangerous and talented, if inexperienced, and the greatest American League threat to the Yankees.</p>
        <p>But that did not seem to matter to the Yankees, who, after their miserable finish, just want to get a fresh start in the playoffs. ''I don't care,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said after it was determined the Yankees would play the Athletics. ''If you're going to win, you've got to beat the best team, anyway. They're obviously hot, but we'll see what happens.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees went 6-3 against the Athletics this year, sweeping three games at Yankee Stadium Aug. 8-10 and taking two of three in Oakland Aug. 25-27. Clemens started against the Athletics once this year, leaving the game after seven solid innings Aug. 8 with the Yankees trailing, 3-2; the Yankees went on to win when Bernie Williams and David Justice hit back-to-back homers in the bottom of the ninth.</p>
        <p>Heredia has pitched well against the Yankees in recent years, going 1-1 with a 3.24 earned run average from 1997-1999, confounding them with his control and his ability to change speeds. They had more luck against him this year, when Heredia allowed nine earned runs in 12 innings.</p>
        <p>Torre used the final game of the regular season more as a tuneup for the postseason than an attempt to break the team's slump. With the outcome of today's game meaningless in the standing, Torre turned his job over to someone else, as he does every year -- and the duties fell to right fielder Paul O'Neill.</p>
        <p>Six everyday players started, including Justice, catcher Jorge Posada and Chuck Knoblauch, who started at designated hitter. Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless inning in relief. Jeter did not get any hits in his two at-bats, finishing the year with 201. Orlando Hernandez, who will start Game 3 of the division series, allowed five runs in six innings, although his numbers probably would have been better if the regular outfielders had started; a couple of balls that should have been caught fell in, costing Hernandez runs.</p>
        <p>Torre said the loss ''doesn't mean anything to me.'' But Torre is worried about Denny Neagle, the left-hander who has had a meteoric descent in the last month. The Yankees traded for him the day after the All-Star Game break and he pitched so well that the Yankee front office was intent on signing him to a contract extension.</p>
        <p>As those talks were delayed, Neagle began to struggle. In his last three outings, he allowed 18 earned runs in 10 2/3 innings. Unsure of how Neagle would respond in a starting role, Torre shifted him to the bullpen for the postseason.</p>
        <p>Hoping Neagle will adapt to that role, Torre made sure that O'Neill used Neagle in relief today, but Neagle pitched poorly again, allowing three hits and a walk in two-thirds of an inning.</p>
        <p>''I'm more concerned about Neagle coming in and not getting people out,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>This is why: the Yankees' middle relief corps is made up of Neagle, who has been terrible; David Cone, who allowed eight hits and six runs in four-plus innings in his last appearance Saturday; and Dwight Gooden, who gave up three runs in four innings in pitching back-to-back days Thursday and Friday.</p>
        <p>Torre will use Randy Choate, a left-handed specialist, to complement the veteran relievers Rivera, Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson. Torre is expected to make his roster final on Monday.</p>
