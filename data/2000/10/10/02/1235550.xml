        <p>Take the three desperate teams that are vying for the last two postseason spots in the American League. Watch them each play on the final scheduled day of the regular season. Wait for the results to show who is in and who is out so that this complicated baseball puzzle can finally be solved.</p>
        <p>The Oakland Athletics, the Seattle Mariners and the Cleveland Indians all won yesterday, which meant that the A's won the A.L. West, the Mariners snatched the wild card and the Indians went home. The Indians pounded the Toronto Blue Jays, 11-4, and then waited anxiously to see if the A's or the Mariners would lose to keep Cleveland's season alive. But Oakland and Seattle won, and the Indians -- who at 90-72 had a better record than the 87-74 Yankees -- experienced an excruciating ending.</p>
        <p>When Jason Isringhausen tossed a gorgeous curveball to strike out Frank Catalanotto, the A's nabbed a 3-0 victory over the Rangers and poured onto the field in Oakland to celebrate their first playoff appearance since 1992. Less than an hour later, Seattle's Kazuhiro Sasaki induced  Ron Gant to pop out to Alex Rodriguez as the Mariners beat the Angels, 5-2, in Anaheim and celebrated, too. Finally, the two elusive spots in the A.L. were decided. Finally, the postseason was set.</p>
        <p>''This is unbelievable,'' said Tim Hudson, who worked eight scoreless innings to win his 20th game and clinch the division for Oakland. ''It's something we worked for all year. I can't say enough about these guys.''</p>
        <p>While teammates poured Champagne on his head, the Mariners' Rodriguez said: ''We showed some guts here toward the end. We earned this position.''</p>
        <p>The floundering Yankees were also in limbo as they waited in Baltimore to find out who their opponent in the division series would be; now they know they will oppose the A's, starting with Game 1 tomorrow night at Oakland.</p>
        <p>It is an intriguing contrast because the two-time defending World Series champion Yankees have lost seven straight games and 15 of their last 18 while the upstart A's, who needed to win in September to reach October, have won 8 of their last 10. The Yankees have to prove that it is possible to sleep through the last few weeks of the regular season and then wake up and win in the postseason.</p>
        <p>''Once the postseason starts, whatever happened in the regular season is gone,'' the Yankees' Tino Martinez said.</p>
        <p>The Mets will also begin their division series in the Bay Area with the opener against the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday. There could also be a nifty postseason doubleheader with a New York flavor on Saturday. The Mets will play the Giants at Shea Stadium and the Yankees might play a Game 4 at Yankee Stadium against Oakland. If the Yankees or A's do not sweep the three-of-five series, there would be wall-to-wall postseason baseball in New York in six days.</p>
        <p>''Now it's whoever can win 11 games and win a championship,'' the Mets' John Franco said. ''We're trying to do that as fast as we can.''</p>
        <p>Even though most of the focus yesterday was on the A's, the Mariners and the Indians, the Atlanta Braves mishandled a 5-3 lead in the ninth inning, lost to the Colorado Rockies, 10-5, and lost the home-field advantage in their division series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Chipper Jones made an error before Todd Helton's three-run homer off John Rocker. The Mariners, who have not been in the postseason since 1997, will oppose the White Sox in the other  A.L. series, opening in Chicago.</p>
        <p>The Indians kept their season breathing for a few extra hours by drilling David Wells and the Blue Jays at Jacobs Field. Kenny Lofton, Sandy Alomar Jr. and Jim Thome stroked homers, and Manny Ramirez hammered a 452-foot homer in what could have been his final at-bat as an Indian. After winning, the Indians flipped caps to the fans behind the third-base dugout and waited.</p>
        <p>The Mariners did not watch the Indians-Blue Jays game in their clubhouse, and Rodriguez said it was stressful to know that the Indians had already won. But, as some Indians watched the A's-Rangers and the Mariners-Angels games on a split screen, they did not like what they saw. Both games were tied through six innings.</p>
        <p>Ramon Hernandez ripped a run-scoring double off the Rangers' Ryan Glynn to break a 0-0 tie in the seventh and catapult the A's (91-70). The victory enabled the A's to avoid a trip to Tampa Bay today for a makeup game. David Bell of the Mariners snapped a 2-2 tie against the Angels with a homer in the seventh. The Mariners finished 91-71, but they could not win the division because the A's won the season series with Seattle, 9-4.</p>
        <p>The Indians (90-72) had spoken hopefully about giving themselves a chance after finishing the second half of the season at 46-30. Alomar said he was going home and wait for a positive call. Lofton said he would probably watch the games. Thome said he would just hope the A's or the Mariners lost. Neither did and the Indians missed the postseason for the first time since 1993.</p>
        <p>''I almost wish it wouldn't come down to the last game,'' Cleveland's Travis Fryman said on Saturday. ''Because I know I'll sit back and think about the whole season and the at-bats and the close games we didn't win.''</p>
