        <p>As a Yale freshman George W. Bush was the only pledge in his fraternity who could stand up and recite the names of the other 49 pledges.

        <p>As a Yale freshman George W. Bush was the only pledge in his fraternity who could stand up and recite the names of the other 49 pledges. In his first year at Harvard Al Gore was knocking on doors and shaking hands while running for freshman council. In ''The Choice 2000,'' a joint biography of the presidential candidates, these differences still define the men and their campaigns: Mr. Bush's cult of personality and Mr. Gore's marathon of perseverance.</p>
        <p>That is the astute but at this point highly unoriginal observation behind this two-hour ''Frontline.'' Coming just five weeks before the election, the film doesn't do much more than that to define the choice voters have to make. Anyone who has been paying attention to the campaign will find ''The Choice'' familiar; anyone who hasn't is not likely to be drawn in by this low-key, superficial work.</p>
        <p>Both candidates were born into families of privilege in which ''You can grow up to be president'' seemed like a birthright rather than a dream. Yet they have taken such opposite personal paths to the same place that they are often viewed as different faces of a single generation, a perspective this film shares but seems to think is fresh.</p>
        <p>The film is best at depicting their childhood years, partly because it is always arresting to see home movies and snapshots. There is the boy called Georgie playing ball in Midland, Tex. And there is Al Jr., son of Senator Albert Gore, at home in the stuffy Fairfax Hotel in Washington.</p>
        <p>Among the people interviewed is the son of the tenants on the Gore farm in Tennessee whose family young Al stayed with during school vacations; Gore Sr. insisted on these stints, which gave the boy a seasoning in hard work and useful political roots. Paradoxically, it was Mr. Bush's ancestors who were rich, blue-blooded Easterners, despite the down-home ease his Texas childhood conferred.</p>
        <p>As it goes back and forth contrasting the men's lives, ''The Choice'' gets progressively weaker, making the necessary, obvious stops. There is Mr. Bush's decision to stop drinking when he turned 40, and the natural political flair that led to his quick rise when he decided to run for governor. There is Mr. Gore's disappointment after his brief run for president in 1988 and the personal tragedies of his sister's death and his young son's serious car accident.</p>
        <p>But ''The Choice'' fails to do the very thing it should: connect all its biographical data to the ideas and styles that drive the campaigns. Only at the end does it ask, as a kind of farewell, whether Governor Bush is intellectually weighty enough to be president and Vice President Gore exciting enough to win.</p>
        <p>''The Choice 2000'' does illuminate the shaky state of political biography on television. Recently ABC took a similar approach and did a more thoughtful, more revealing job of connecting biography and politics in a two-part prime-time special called ''Family Business.'' (It included the anecdotes about Mr. Bush's memory for pledges and Mr. Gore's freshman campaign; apparently there are only so many telling details in anyone's life.) But the fine ''Family Business'' was practically buried. It was not sent out for review; the second part was shown opposite the Olympics opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>More often what passes for political biography is fluff. ''The Choice 2000'' is serious, but it doesn't get points just because it avoids the candidates' heartfelt opinions about peanut butter sandwiches and breakfast cereal. Disappointing and sketchy, this ''Frontline'' shows that being serious is not the same as being substantial.</p>
