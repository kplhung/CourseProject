        <p>'Yes, Dear'</p>
        <p>CBS, tonight at 8:30</p>
        <p>The title of this new sitcom might suggest the usual cliched treatment of a tired old married couple. In fact what we have here is a generic treatment of two tired young couples.</p>
        <p>Greg and Kim Warner (Anthony Clark and Jean Louisa Kelly) are frazzled suburbanites coping with first-time parenthood. Greg has the added job of coping with Kim, a stay-at-home mom who obsesses about doing all the right things for 1-year-old Sam, as prescribed in the latest child-development books. (''Mommy doesn't want you to grow up to have food issues,'' defenseless little Sam is told between spoonfuls.)</p>
        <p>The aim is to spoof today's anxious, competitive, humorless culture of child rearing. That's a promising idea, but good satire requires wit and some bite, and little is evident in tonight's pilot episode.</p>
        <p>As yin to Greg and Kim's yang is a second pair of standard types: Kim's sexually bored sister, Christine (Liza Snyder), and Christine's do-nothing husband, Jimmy (Mike O'Malley), a couple with two children and a laissez-faire policy toward them. As the freeloading brother-in-law, Mr. O'Malley gets in a few good one-liners, but he's also a mouthpiece for obvious, juvenile humor.</p>
        <p>Next week it's about breast feeding. One can guess what to expect when it's potty-training time.</p>
