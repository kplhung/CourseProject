        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Better Nursing Home Care'' (editorial, Sept. 25):</p>
        <p>You are correct when you state that, regarding current Medicare restoration proposals, ''none of that touches the issue of inadequate staff.'' For that matter, neither does the president's proposed billion-dollar grant program. His proposal would add only about 10,000 new staff members in the first year for the nation's 16,000 nursing homes.</p>

        <p>Re ''Better Nursing Home Care'' (editorial, Sept. 25):</p>
        <p>You are correct when you state that, regarding current Medicare restoration proposals, ''none of that touches the issue of inadequate staff.'' For that matter, neither does the president's proposed billion-dollar grant program. His proposal would add only about 10,000 new staff members in the first year for the nation's 16,000 nursing homes.</p>
        <p>There are two fundamental obstacles that must also be addressed. First, as you note, Congress and state governments must be willing to pay, especially in the Medicaid program and to a lesser degree in Medicare. Second, Congress must act to increase the size of the available pool of labor, by enacting immigration legislation aimed at bringing health care workers into the country.</p>
