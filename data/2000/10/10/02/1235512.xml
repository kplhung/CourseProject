        <p>New York Giants coach Jim Fassel discusses several controversial referee calls that went against Giants in loss to Tennessee Titans (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Giants hoped briefly that they had changed the momentum of today's game. Early in the second half, with the score was 21-0, the Giants' Lyle West recovered the ball on the Titans' 7-yard line after Derrick Mason lost it on a punt return as he stumbled away from Reggie Stephens's hit.</p>
        <p>Officials initially ruled that Mason had fumbled the ball out of bounds. The Giants requested a video replay; television replays indicated that West fell on the ball before he touched the sideline. Officials changed their call, saying Mason had been downed by contact, and gave Tennessee possession.</p>

        <p>The Giants hoped briefly that they had changed the momentum of today's game. Early in the second half, with the score was 21-0, the Giants' Lyle West recovered the ball on the Titans' 7-yard line after Derrick Mason lost it on a punt return as he stumbled away from Reggie Stephens's hit.</p>
        <p>Officials initially ruled that Mason had fumbled the ball out of bounds. The Giants requested a video replay; television replays indicated that West fell on the ball before he touched the sideline. Officials changed their call, saying Mason had been downed by contact, and gave Tennessee possession.</p>
        <p>''We went around and around in circles,'' said Giants Coach Jim Fassel, who has never won a replay challenge. ''They're throwing curveballs at me, and I'm trying to swing at every one of them. Every time I was asking for a challenge, they were saying something different. Three times.''</p>
        <p>Fassel said the explanations he received included the ball going out of bounds, West's being out of bounds when he recovered the fumble and West's elbow being out of bounds.</p>
        <p>He stressed that he was not blaming officials for the loss.</p>
        <p>One Bright Spot</p>
        <p>The Giants' special teams played surprisingly well. The rookie Ron Dixon quickly atoned for a first-quarter mistake, but needed help from the officials. Dixon tried to down a punt on the 1-yard line but came around the ball, his foot touching the goal line. That made it a touchback.</p>
        <p>On the next punt, Dixon leapt into the end zone to bat the ball onto the field, where the Giants downed it at the 2. The officials let the play stand, even though television replays indicated that Dixon landed in the end zone while holding the ball. (No matter. The Titans drove 98 yards and scored for a 14-0 lead.)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Jaret Holmes, the Giants' new kicker, averaged 71.7 yards on kickoffs, negating the Titans' kick returner, Derrick Mason. The Titans led the league by starting their drives after kickoffs at the 37.4-yard line. Each of Holmes's three kickoffs reached the end zone; two resulted in touchbacks.</p>
        <p>Holmes was signed Saturday to replace Brad Daluiso, who went on the inactive list with a stiff back.</p>
