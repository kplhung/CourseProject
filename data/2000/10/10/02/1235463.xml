        <p>THE INFORMANT  By Kurt Eichenwald  606 pages. Broadway Books. $26.</p>
        <p>The Archer Daniels Midland Company calls itself ''Supermarket to the World,'' but you won't find shelves of its products in your local market. That's because it doesn't make consumer products. Rather, it churns out products like high-fructose corn syrup, ethanol and lysine that go into products like juices, motor fuel and animal feed produced by other companies. But although the company isn't widely known to the general public, it is a household name in the homes inhabited by the business and political elites.</p>
        <p>Archer Daniels Midland is famous -- some would say infamous -- for lavishing contributions on politicians of both parties and buying immense clout. It lobbies to keep sugar prices high, so it can make fat profits on high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener that competes with sugar. It also lobbies to keep the price of gasoline mixed with ethanol artificially low, so its ethanol can compete with petroleum as motor fuel.</p>
        <p>Archer Daniels Midland has had its share of scandals, the most famous of which is Watergate: a check to the Nixon campaign from the company's chairman was a major piece of evidence. But the scandal that posed the biggest risk to the company came in 1995, when it was charged with conspiring with competitors around the world to fix the price of lysine, an animal food additive. The lysine scandal is at the heart of ''The Informant,'' written by Kurt Eichenwald, a reporter for The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The lysine affair was more than just the business scandal du jour because the F.B.I. had gotten one of the company's highest-ranking officers, Mark Whitacre, to wear a recording device for years and to keep detailed notes of price-fixing meetings.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Whitacre, the book's title character, proved to be more than a little unreliable. In fact, he was delusional, something that no one, including Archer Daniels Midland, seems to have realized until after the scandal broke and the company started turning over every rock it could find looking for dirt on its renegade executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre (pronounced WIT-occur) ended up with the heaviest sentence of anyone in the scandal because he was such a liar and so erratic that the government withdrew its offer of immunity from prosecution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eichenwald gives us dozens of intimate conversations. And much of it isn't of the he-said, she-said variety. He has obtained previously unavailable transcripts and other documents, and the book is informed by the five years he spent covering scandals involving the company and the contacts he made in the process. ''The Informant'' doesn't read like a business document, it reads like an Ed McBain crime novel, only one without murder or sex. The main characters are Mr. Whitacre and the F.B.I. agent who turned him into a source, Brian Shepard. We get 500 pages of what these people were thinking and doing, and it all rings true.</p>
        <p>The book, unfortunately, starts out jumbled. The initial scene involves Mr. Shepard and another F.B.I. agent, but we don't immediately learn who they are. The list of main characters at the beginning of the book doesn't help much, but within a few pages the reader is hooked. I knew how the story ended, but I still couldn't put the book down.</p>
        <p>Unlike many books of reconstructed events and dialogue, ''The Informant'' provides us with sources for virtually every important fact, tucked neatly in notes at the back rather than clunking up the text. This technique is far superior to the unsourced, ''trust me'' technique that is the norm today. Mr. Eichenwald is even honest enough to note when the subjects disagree about who did what or said what to whom.</p>
        <p>There are endless nifty details of back-and-forth conversations involving both the investigators and some of their targets at Archer Daniels Midland and the other companies that conspired with it to fix lysine prices. These tales reek of real life, especially the parts showing mounting confusion and internal knife fighting on the government side as the feds tried to figure out what to do with Mr. Whitacre, who buckled under the pressure and became increasingly erratic.</p>
        <p>My favorite insights are the scenes where the company's executives talk about how its competitors are its friends and its customers are the enemy. And how one of the F.B.I. agents in the case becomes furious at the company when he realizes that the artificially high price of lysine is ruining one of his relatives' animal-feed business. It's a telling example of how even the whitest of white-collar crimes can ruin victims' lives, even if they don't know what's going on.</p>
        <p>One of the wonderful paradoxes that Mr. Eichenwald brings out is that the F.B.I. investigation that resulted in Mr. Whitacre's becoming an informer was based on a false story that he had concocted about a competitor of Archer Daniels Midland seeking a bribe to undo sabotage at his company's lysine plant. Mr. Whitacre had made up the story to deflect the pressure his bosses were putting on him because the plant wasn't working properly. Mr. Whitacre also invented an incident about his daughter's safety being threatened.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Eichenwald doesn't tell us -- probably because it's unknowable -- is what makes Mr. Whitacre tick and how he got to the head of the company's bioproducts department despite his weaknesses, which in hindsight seem so glaring. Among other things Mr. Whitacre embezzled millions of dollars from the company, which didn't realize the money was gone until it began looking for material with which to discredit him.</p>
        <p>Conspicuously missing from ''The Informant'' is Mr. Eichenwald himself. The book's one major shortcoming is lack of overall perspective. Rather than his one-page musing on the nature of truth, Mr. Eichenwald would have done better to step outside his reporter's role and give us a meaty chapter on what he thinks of all this.</p>
        <p>Is Archer Daniels Midland a typical company? Does Wall Street pressure to keep profits rising every quarter lead the company to cheat, or is it something inherent in its corporate culture? What made Mr. Whitacre what he is, and how on earth did he climb as high as he did? Is Mr. Whitacre typical of high-level government informants? The book could also use a chronology of major events.</p>
        <p>But, quibbles aside, ''The Informant'' is a good and valuable book. Its reporting is extraordinary and sucks you in. It shows how in big business life can imitate art. And Mr. Eichenwald didn't even have to make any of it up.</p>
