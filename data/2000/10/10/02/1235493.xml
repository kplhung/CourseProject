        <p>In 1929 Thomas Wolfe, big, bombastic and unkempt, strode into the literary world with a huge novel about the making of a genius: himself. ''Look Homeward, Angel,'' Faustian in its ambition, was about Eugene Gant, Wolfe's alter ego, and his self-dramatizing relatives from Altamont, a fictionalized version of Wolfe's hometown, Asheville, N.C.</p>
        <p>Gant's anxious, penny-pinching mother owns a boarding house; his father is a drunken stonecutter. Eugene loses his virginity in a brothel and has a sexual encounter with one of his mother's boarders, a woman five years his senior. He attends Pulpit Hill, based on Wolfe's alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
        <p>When his beloved older brother dies, Gant realizes his true vocation: writing. ''Look Homeward, Angel'' is both a denunciation of small-town provincialism and a loving attempt to preserve it. Especially, it is a novel about identity and the creation of an artist.</p>
        <p>''Naked and alone we came into exile,'' Wolfe wrote. ''In her dark womb we did not know our mother's face; from the prison of her flesh have we come into the unspeakable and incommunicable prison of this earth. . . . Which of us has not remained forever prison-pent? Which of us is not forever a stranger and alone?''</p>
        <p>Here at last was a novelist with the sheer lung power to take on the American experience. But from the beginning critics took issue with Wolfe's big, untidy work. Many said Maxwell E. Perkins, his editor at Charles Scribner's Sons, was the book's true author.</p>
        <p>Perkins, who also edited Hemingway and Fitzgerald, obtained Wolfe's permission to cut 60,000 words from the manuscript. Perkins made some excisions simply because of Wolfe's verbosity, others because he considered the passages to be scatological or disrespectful toward religion, sports, patriotism or Southern mores. Without Perkins's patient editing, critics said, the book would have been a formless mass.</p>
        <p>Over time Wolfe's reputation ebbed. Today he is known mostly as a novelist for late adolescents, and his work, if read at all, is usually the domain of college curriculums.</p>
        <p>But tomorrow, Wolfe's centenary, the University of South Carolina Press will publish ''O Lost: A Story of the Buried Life,'' a restored version of ''Look Homeward Angel,'' using Wolfe's original title. It is edited by a married couple: Arlyn Bruccoli, an independent scholar, and Matthew J. Bruccoli, a professor of English at the University of South Carolina and a biographer of Fitzgerald.</p>
        <p>The same publisher is also issuing ''To Loot My Life Clean: The Thomas Wolfe-Maxwell Perkins Correspondence,'' a collection of letters between Wolfe and Perkins and members of the Scribner staff, most never before published in their entirety. Edited by Mr. Bruccoli and Park Bucker, the letters reveal no startling facts about Wolfe but dramatize his overweening ambition and the pain of his eventual break with Perkins.</p>
        <p>There will also be celebrations of the centenary in Asheville, including the unveiling of a Thomas Wolfe postage stamp.</p>
        <p>'' 'O Lost' is a better, a greater artistic achievement than 'Look Homeward Angel,' '' Mr. Bruccoli said in a telephone interview. It is, he added, ''a complete, structured novel that apart from reasons of censorship was publishable as he wrote it and submitted it.''</p>
        <p>Because it was known that Perkins edited the manuscript heavily, Wolfe became the victim of a ''libel that he was incapable of writing a novel, that he was sloppy and undisciplined,'' Mr. Bruccoli said.</p>
        <p>''A generation of college students were taught about Wolfe by mainly antagonistic professors, who inculcated the slander that he's a 'young adult' author,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruccoli is a staunch champion of the version of the novel he and his wife have edited. ''Perkins was the greatest discoverer of literary talent in America,'' he said. ''Perkins believed he was improving the book, and we disagree.''</p>
        <p>The publication of ''O Lost'' marks nothing less than the restoration of ''a masterpiece to the literary canon,'' Mr. Bruccoli said.</p>
        <p>Wolfe began making notes for the book as a graduate student in a play-writing course at Harvard. After Harvard, he had no luck in getting his wordy outpourings produced onstage, and got a job teaching English literature and composition at New York University. In New York he met Aline Bernstein, a theatrical set designer and a wealthy, married  mother of two nearly 18 years his senior. Her face was like a pansy, Wolfe said, and they began an affair. Later he used her as the model for Esther Jack in ''Of Time and the River.''</p>
        <p>Bernstein urged Wolfe to switch to writing novels because they would be more suitable to his Whitmanesque style. She supported him while he wrote the first draft of ''O Lost.'' In return Wolfe, a monomaniacally self-absorbed alcoholic, accused her of being unfaithful while he frequented prostitutes.</p>
        <p>Wolfe's finished manuscript was rejected by several editors because it ''was so amateurish, autobiographical and unskillful,'' he wrote in ''The Story of a Novel,'' an essay. He hurled anti-Semitic invectives at Bernstein, berating her because she could not find him a publisher.</p>
        <p>Finally the manuscript was sent to Perkins. Contrary to publishing myth, it did not have to be delivered in a truck, Mr. Bruccoli said. It was 1,100 double-spaced pages and 294,000 words, not 330,000 words. It was not five feet high but about six inches high, he added. Perkins himself said, ''The extent of cutting in that book has somehow come to be greatly exaggerated.'' But the legends grew anyway, perhaps partly because of the novel's length and Wolfe's dramatic personality.</p>
        <p>The 28-year-old Wolfe was desperately eager to be published. Critics have said that Perkins, a reserved New Englander, became the steady father Wolfe never had, and Perkins, with five daughters, made of this tempestuous young writer the son he never had. ''For the first time in my life I was getting criticism I could really use,'' Wolfe wrote.</p>
        <p>Perkins cut the novel to focus more on Eugene. He also trimmed the opening, 21,400 words about Eugene's father, W. O. Gant, and the Battle of Gettysburg. (Perkins said later that he regretted the cut.) He also excised characters as well as Wolfe's parodies of boys' fiction and of T. S. Eliot. He shortened passages about Eugene's college career. The last encounter between Eugene and his brother's ghost was ''truncated and butchered,'' Mr. Bruccoli writes in the introduction to ''O Lost.''</p>
        <p>Perkins also cut a description of a boy displaying his genitals, , another about a youth having sex with a chicken and a bawdy song about ''three whores from Canada.'' Some of the passages that were cut seem innocuous today. In one section Eugene describes his father carving a tombstone: ''He felt that this was no common craftsman, but a master, picking up his tools again for a brief chef-d'oeuvre.'' Perkins cut a final clause from the sentence -- ''or as a lesson to aspiring disciples'' -- because he feared that Wolfe might seem to be comparing Eugene's father to Jesus.</p>
        <p>Another passage was cut because Perkins thought it would be interpreted as a criticism of sportsmanship, which in 1929 was equated with patriotism: ''Even as he grew older, Eugene could not understand the idea of the playing field -- the canting talk of 'sportsmanship' which seemed to him to give to the stronger unhampered license to prey upon the weaker.''</p>
        <p>Passages in which Wolfe ridicules the South were also removed. Eugene, Wolfe wrote, could not think of Southern women ''without the bigotry and petulance with which they used the romantic legend that enhaloed them, nor of the men without the cowardice and gregariousness of their opinions, nor of anything their lives had to offer without the pretentious sentimentality.''</p>
        <p>Finally Perkins changed Wolfe's title to ''Look Homeward, Angel'' because the publisher's salesmen said ''O Lost'' ''was not a good title, not a selling title,'' Mr. Bruccoli said.</p>
        <p>The final book was 626 pages. If ''O Lost'' had been printed in its entirety with the same type and page size as the cut version, it would have been about 825 pages, Mr. Bruccoli said. Such a volume would definitely have been publishable, he added, noting that the 1936 edition of ''Gone With the Wind'' had more than 1,000 pages.</p>
        <p>When ''Look Homeward, Angel'' was published, Margaret Wallace wrote in The New York Times Book Review that it was ''as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life.''</p>
        <p>''Mr. Wolfe's style is sprawling, fecund, subtly rhythmic and amazingly vital,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The citizens of Asheville, however, were furious, and Wolfe didn't return home for seven years.</p>
        <p>After the novel was published, Wolfe broke with Bernstein. Ever understanding, she helped him pack for a trip to Europe financed by a Guggenheim fellowship.</p>
        <p>Perkins went on to edit ''Of Time and the River,'' published in 1935. Reviewing the book in The New Republic, the critic Malcolm Cowley compared Wolfe to Dickens and Dostoyevsky but said that ''the trouble is that the best passages are scattered, that they occur without logic or pattern.''</p>
        <p>Other reviewers were already muttering that Wolfe's work was really Perkins's creation and simply badly edited autobiography. ''Works of art cannot be assembled like a carburetor,'' Bernard DeVoto wrote in The Saturday Review.</p>
        <p>Inevitably Wolfe broke with Perkins, writing to him: ''You know and I know that beginning with 'Look Homeward, Angel,' and mounting steadily there has been a constantly increasing objection and opposition to what I wanted to do, which phrased itself in various forms, but which had the total effect of dampening my hope, cooling my enthusiasm and almost nullifying my creative capacity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruccoli said that ''Perkins's friends and associates said Perkins died of a broken heart.'' He added that Perkins ''said over and over again, 'Working with Wolfe was the greatest excitement of my entire publishing life.' ''</p>
        <p>Edward C. Aswell of Harper &amp; Brothers was the next editor for Wolfe, who died in 1938 of tuberculosis that had spread to his brain. After Wolfe's death Aswell edited him more heavily than Perkins had, cutting his manuscripts ''The Web and the Rock'' (1939), ''You Can't Go Home Again'' (1940) and the stories in ''The Hills Beyond'' (1941), which some critics said contained Wolfe's best and most self-disciplined work.</p>
        <p>Whether or not ''O Lost'' restores Wolfe's literary reputation, for the moment he seems to be remembered mostly for the grandeur of his failures. ''Among his and my contemporaries,'' Faulkner wrote, ''I rated Wolfe first because we had all failed, but Wolfe had made the best failure because he had tried hardest to say the most.''</p>
        <p>In this passage, cut from the original version of ''Look Homeward, Angel,'' Eugene thinks he has contracted a venereal disease from a prostitute, and Ben, his brother, takes him to a doctor.  What follows is a rumination on the seduction of helpless men.</p>
        <p>The old gods and goddesses were no better. Aegis-bearing Zeus seduced a great number of young virgins, appearing to them disguised as a bull, a swan, a shower of gold and in whatever other shapes seemed most convenient to him. Venus, the so-called goddess of love, was a living symbol of unbridled lust, and had a whole legion of lovers, divine and mortal.</p>
        <p>The wife of Potiphar, prime minister of Egypt, lay her snares for a young man of strong character and unimpeachable morals. When he repulsed her, she plotted against his life. Think of the titled mistresses of King Charles the Second of England, the powdered courtesans of the dissolute kings of France, Lesbia, the faithless mistress of the poet Catullus, a faithless wife to boot, the unspeakable Sappho and Queen Catherine the Great of Russia, whom Byron justly calls the world's most celebrated whore. Think of Queen Helen, most beautiful of mortal women, that adulterous whore for whom Troy was put to the sack and burned, and for whom countless numbers of the Argive men suffered woes innumerable, and were given to the birds to scavenge . . . in order that the will of god might be accomplished. . . . Clytemnaestra, her hands dabbled with the blood of Agamemnon, Becky Sharpe, with her lover dead upon the field at Waterloo, Lucrezia Borgia -- the proud black names, each with its wrought skein of evil, marched through his brain their awful pageantry of treason, Lesbic loves, the smiling kiss of poison, the red smear of lust and murder, weaving all life, all nature, all men, bright shoals of flapping minnows, helplessly and irresistibly into their net.</p>
        <p>''And right here -- in this town, now, this very minute, it is happening. All around us!'' he burst out in resentful fury.</p>
