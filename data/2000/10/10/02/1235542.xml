      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial praises Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist for openness regarding ethical dilemma, in which son James Rehnquist is part of legal team representing Microsoft Corp in antitrust case pending before court, but says he should still recuse himself from case since public disclosure alone cannot cure underlying problem, which is preserving public confidence in disinterested decision-making by nation's highest court (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Chief Justice William Rehnquist took the occasion of last week's Supreme Court decision turning the government's case against Microsoft back to a lower court to air a personal ethical dilemma. In a brief statement, Mr. Rehnquist explained that he had decided not to disqualify himself from participating in the court's deliberations on Microsoft even though his son, James Rehnquist, is part of a team of lawyers defending Microsoft against rival companies in a private antitrust case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rehnquist's openness about the situation is praiseworthy. For a judge to reveal the thinking behind a recusal decision is all too rare. But disclosure alone cannot cure the underlying problem here, which is preserving public confidence in disinterested decision-making by the nation's highest court.</p>

        <p>Chief Justice William Rehnquist took the occasion of last week's Supreme Court decision turning the government's case against Microsoft back to a lower court to air a personal ethical dilemma. In a brief statement, Mr. Rehnquist explained that he had decided not to disqualify himself from participating in the court's deliberations on Microsoft even though his son, James Rehnquist, is part of a team of lawyers defending Microsoft against rival companies in a private antitrust case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rehnquist's openness about the situation is praiseworthy. For a judge to reveal the thinking behind a recusal decision is all too rare. But disclosure alone cannot cure the underlying problem here, which is preserving public confidence in disinterested decision-making by the nation's highest court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rehnquist said he does not believe that ''a well-informed individual would conclude that an appearance of impropriety exists simply because my son represents in another case, a party that is also a party to litigation pending in this Court.'' But this is not just ''another case.'' The overlap here goes well beyond the client's identity. The case his son is handling involves the same client, Microsoft, in an antitrust matter involving some of the very same issues the government is litigating. Indeed, notes Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University Law School, the outcome of the government's Microsoft case could have a decisive impact on the private antitrust case.</p>
        <p>We share Mr. Rehnquist's concern that his recusal could result in a 4-to-4 split in a case of great public moment. But a justice with Mr. Rehnquist's personal conflict should not be casting the tie-breaking vote. Should the government's case return to the Supreme Court, Mr. Rehnquist should step aside.</p>
