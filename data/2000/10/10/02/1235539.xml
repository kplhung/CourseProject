        <p>The retired pastor of a large Roman Catholic church in Queens is suspected of stealing millions of dollars from his affluent parish and giving much of it away in what may be a strange case of felonious charity -- a misguided effort to help people he saw as needy, church and law-enforcement officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The priest, Msgr. Thomas J. Gradilone, 75, who retired last January after 17 years as rector of Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church in Forest Hills, has not been charged with any crime, officials said, but is under investigation by the Diocese of Brooklyn and the Queens district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>Monsignor Gradilone, known to many of the 2,900 families in his parish as a generous, caring, community-spirited man who gave cash to people who told him they were desperate for rent money, or for college tuition or other needs, may have embezzled more than $2 million from Sunday collections, church repair funds and direct solicitations from parishioners and others, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''I have learned that substantial sums have passed from Monsignor Gradilone to one or more individuals in amounts that greatly exceed the bounds of charity normally accepted as a response to people in serious need,'' Bishop Thomas V. Daily, whose diocese comprises Brooklyn and Queens, told parishioners at five Masses yesterday at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs.</p>
        <p>''Monsignor Gradilone insisted to me that he distributed the funds as charity,'' the bishop added. ''Information brought to my attention, however, indicates that the monies were not given for worthwhile purposes. In charity, I am compelled to say that Monsignor Gradilone's explanation of his activity, given to me and my representatives, has limited credibility.''</p>
        <p>Bishop Daily said that diocesan auditors estimated that $2 million had been diverted by Monsignor Gradilone over many years, although The Daily News, which reported the case yesterday, quoted unnamed church sources as saying that as much as $8 million had been stolen.</p>
        <p>While there were no indications that the monsignor had lived lavishly or had enriched himself , church officials and other investigators said it was unclear where all the missing money went.</p>
        <p>Since Monsignor Gradilone had been unwilling or unable to identify those who received the money or to explain his ''erratic behavior,'' Bishop Daily said he had notified the Queens district attorney, who undertook an investigation three weeks ago. But he said he was still not sure of the monsignor's culpability.</p>
        <p>''I struggle to determine whether he is, for some reason, a victim of these individuals who have been the beneficiaries, or merely a victimizer, or perhaps both,'' the bishop said. ''I am even pursuing the possibility that his actions have been caused by an unknown physical condition.''</p>
        <p>Investigators said that church officials first began to suspect financial irregularities at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in early 1999, when the parish made a contribution to a diocesan fund-raising program that was inordinately large, even for the affluent Catholic community in Forest Hills. A check of Sunday collections then showed sums that seemed inordinately low.</p>
        <p>An audit of parish finances then turned up more troubling discrepancies, for which Monsignor Gradilone, in interviews with Bishop Daily and other church officials, had no satisfactory explanation, the investigators said. One item, The Daily News said, was a six-figure donation to a charitable trust that a parishioner entrusted to the monsignor, but which was never wired to the trust.</p>
        <p>Monsignor Gradilone, who retired as the church investigation focused on his conduct last winter, lives in Douglaston, Queens. He was in seclusion yesterday ''to reflect deeply on these events'' the bishop said, and was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>The Queens District Attorney, Richard A. Brown, acknowledged that a report of financial irregularities at the church was under investigation, but declined to give details.</p>
        <p>After the Masses yesterday, Msgr. Joseph Funaro, the pastor of Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, also declined to comment substantively on the case, and said only that he was unhappy over the situation.</p>
        <p>But parishioners expressed shock and dismay over the allegations, and some voiced sympathy for Monsignor Gradilone and spoke of him as a man of generosity and intelligence as they gathered yesterday outside the church, an imposing granite edifiace on Queens Boulevard, at Ascan Avenue, that shares a block with an attached rectory and the parish elementary school.</p>
        <p>''I'm very surprised that something like this would happen,'' said Herbert Tamayo, 38, a Forest Hills resident and a parishioner for eight years. ''I don't think anybody should make any prejudgments until the matter is completely investigated.''</p>
        <p>Arthur Lenihan, 72, a longtime parishioner, said he was taken aback.: ''It troubles me to think that a member of the church would do such a thing, against his values, against human behavior, and against ordinary daily normal living,'' he said. ''Even if he did do it for charitable purposes, it wasn't his money to give.''</p>
        <p>Mingling with the parishioners, Sandi Herschberg, 48, said she had worked as a part-time receptionist for Monsignor Gradilone in the early 1990's and that he had given money to many needy people, including her. She said he gave her $2,000 at a time when she was caring for her elderly mother, a Holocaust survivor who was in a wheelchair, and she owed back rent and was facing eviction.</p>
        <p>''I don't know any of the details and I don't want to know,'' Ms. Herschberg said of the allegations against the monsignor. ''All I know is that he saved my life. He was like a father to me. I feel sick about this. I see a beautiful man being destroyed.''</p>
        <p>Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for the Diocsese of Brooklyn, which includes 217 parishes and 156 schools, said that Monsignor Gradilone was ordained in 1950, and had a distinguished academic and pastoral career in the diocese. After working briefly as a parish priest, he became a teacher in 1950 at Cathedral College, a seminary then in Brooklyn. He earned a masters degree at Fordham University in 1955, and a doctorate in human letters there in 1962, when he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
        <p>In 1967, when Cathedral College moved to Douglaston, Queens, he served as its academic dean for three years, and then from 1970 to 1982 was rector and president of the college. He became pastor of Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in 1982 and held the post until retiring last January. From 1983 to 1998, he was also a trustee of the Queens Borough Public Library Foundation Board, and in recent years was its vice president.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Cospito, an administrator at St. Francis and St. Jude Chapel in Forest Hills, said he had known Monsignor Gradilone for 15 years and voiced shock and disbelief at the allegations. ''He's one person I'm going to pray for an awful lot,'' Mr. Cospito said.</p>
