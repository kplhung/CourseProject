        <p>Nearly a lifetime ago, during World War II, Japanese soldiers seized a strapping teenage peasant named Wang Songlin from a dirt path in his rural village in central China and shipped him off to work as a slave in coal mines owned by the Mitsubishi Company near Nagasaki in Japan.</p>
        <p>He was housed on the floor in a windowless warehouse and he still remembers the backbreaking work, the constant hunger and the vicious beatings meted out to those who complained. By the end of the war, the other 10 men taken from Mr. Wang's hometown had all died or gone out of their minds. Mr. Wang was forced to fish a friend's body out of a well after he committed suicide.</p>
        <p>Now, 55 years later, Mr. Wang -- partly deaf and missing teeth -- has joined thousands of other old Chinese men who served as forced laborers for Japanese companies in a landmark lawsuit filed this year in California asking them for an apology and compensation. ''I am old and I may die soon,'' said Mr. Wang, angrily. ''But I have asked my son and grandson to continue until this is resolved.''</p>
        <p>The old men are hoping that the United States court system will provide the millions of Chinese enslaved by Japan with a sense of justice and international recognition that history, Asian politics and regional judicial systems have so far failed to provide.</p>
        <p>They are suing under a 1999 California law that allows victims who have been unable to pursue their claims elsewhere to file suit in California state courts against companies that may have benefited from slave labor years ago and now have subsidiaries in the United States. In addition to the Chinese men, slave laborers from the Philippines and Korea have also brought suit using the same California law.</p>
        <p>They are all hoping to repeat the success in other suits brought by Holocaust survivors against Swiss banks, German companies and other businesses across Europe, which have yielded $6.2 billion in recent settlements.</p>
        <p>While such lawsuits have generally not yielded large rewards to individuals, a small sum could still mean a lot to the Chinese retirees, they said. And their main goal is to force Japan to accept some guilt and responsibility for their wartime misdeeds -- burdens that German politicians have shouldered, but Japanese have generally avoided, they say.</p>
        <p>''Discovering that we could file the case in the U.S. was like finding a shortcut to justice,'' said Zhang Yibo, a retired professor at the Communist Party School of Shenyang, who organized the mostly illiterate former laborers. ''We are taking advantage of the U.S. courts and also the chance to be heard in a third country.''</p>
        <p>On May 19 this year, Yang Li, a Shenyang-born lawyer who now practices in New York, filed a class action suit on behalf of the men against the Mitsubishi and Mitsui Companies, which is being reviewed by the Federal District Court in San Francisco. In late August, a similar suit was filed in Los Angeles by Barry Fisher, a lawyer who has helped Gypsy survivors of the Holocaust gain millions of dollars in compensation.</p>
        <p>''If this route worked for the Jews, why not for the Chinese?'' said Professor Zhang, clutching the carved wooden dragon at the top of his cane.  ''People forget us, but we suffered as much as them.''</p>
        <p>When the Japanese surrendered in 1945, an American ship took Mr. Wang back to China, where he and the estimated 50,000 Chinese forced laborers who toiled in Japan were mostly forgotten, their plight eclipsed by the Communist revolution of 1949 and the tumultuous years of early Chinese Communism. He settled here in Shenyang. In 1978, China and Japan signed a general friendship treaty, pushing them farther in the background. In the years since, many Chinese scholars and victims have remained deeply dismayed by what they consider Japan's unwillingness to accept moral or financial responsibility for its actions, including forcing women into military brothels and using Chinese as guinea pigs in medical experiments.</p>
        <p>As China has opened politically in the last two decades, they have found new opportunities to press their case and Chinese war victims have attempted to file 46 suits in Japanese courts -- all to no avail.</p>
        <p>A 1999 California law that allowed victims of forced labor during World War II to sue until 2010 provided a new tailor-made opportunity, at a time when Tokyo courts had started dismissing the Chinese claims.</p>
        <p>Yang Li, the New York lawyer, served as the bridge between the old,  mostly illiterate men and the American legal system. The suit names two of the men as representatives -- one worked for Mitsubishi, the other for Mitsui. There are more than 8,000 other co-claimants, including Mr. Wang, who have also signed on, Professor Zhang said.</p>
        <p>There were an estimated 50,000 Chinese used as slaves in Japan and, in addition, 10 million or more who worked as forced laborers for Japanese companies in northwestern China, which was occupied by the Japanese for 14 years. Up to 10 percent of them died, experts say. Professor Zhang said that 35 companies used Chinese forced labor, and that suits against the other companies would soon follow.</p>
        <p>Shenyang has become a center of activism for those seeking compensation, in part because it was the first Chinese city occupied by the Japanese -- on Sept. 18, 1931, the start of a brutal 14-year occupation. Shenyang people say World War II started on that day.</p>
        <p>Every Sept. 18 at 10:20 p.m. -- the exact moment the Japanese marched into the city -- all bells and car horns here toll in unison. ''All of Shenyang cries,'' Professor Zhang said. Indeed, here in northeastern China nearly everyone has a tale of horror. As a boy of 14, Professor Zhang watched Japanese soldiers bury his father alive, cementing the son's loyalty to the Communists, who fought savagely to oust the invaders.</p>
        <p>In addition to the forced laborers, a number of other Chinese are attempting to sue the Japanese for crimes during World War II, under various laws in the United States and Japan. The groups include women who were forced into army brothels and people who lived in villages sprayed with toxins like botulism and plague.</p>
        <p>But the forced laborers in many ways have a more straightforward case, experts say, because they are suing companies rather than a government. They were generally abducted late in the war to work in factories and mines, after Japan's own labor force had been decimated by its battles.</p>
        <p>Wen Jinhan, a hearty 75-year-old with a pompadour that makes him somewhat resemble Ronald Reagan, was 17 and working in his family's fields when he was arrested by armed Japanese in 1943 in central Hebei Province. The Japanese had already occupied that area for about five years, so it came as a shock when they started carting off locals.</p>
        <p>On the day he was seized, the Japanese rounded up about 200 young men from nearby villages, Mr. Wen recalled, taking them by truck and train to a processing center in the distant Chinese port of Tianjin. There, the sick -- even those who had scars -- were weeded out and killed, he said.</p>
        <p>The rest were issued uniforms and a blanket, and held under such tight security that they were even required to urinate in their rooms. They made the 12-day trip to Japan in the hold of a ship filled with coal. ''Those who tried to escape were shot in front of their friends,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He and Mr. Wang ended up in the same Japanese mine, where beatings for disobedience were fierce and constant -- often because the young Chinese peasants did not understand the instructions.</p>
        <p>There were no plates or spoons, and the two daily meals each consisted of a bone and a ladle of burning hot soup placed directly into the laborers' mouths. ''It was so hot the skin on your tongue often fell off, but you had to eat it otherwise it was taken away,'' Mr. Wen said.</p>
        <p>They were no baths, and the laborers were so hungry they ate rotten orange peels that had been discarded by the Japanese. Many fell ill, but they dared not miss shifts since those who did not work did not eat, Mr. Wang said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang said he eagerly signed on this summer when he read in a Shenyang newspaper that Professor Zhang was organizing men to sue in the United States. ''I still have scars from that work,'' he said, rolling up his pants to show the remnants of a deep gash.</p>
        <p>Although the case is in its early stages, the two Japanese companies have tried -- so far unsuccessfully -- to have it dismissed. They claim that wartime claims are a matter of international politics, and that the compensation issue was settled in the San Francisco Treaty of 1951.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yang counters that China was not a party to that treaty, which he said covered only state-to-state reparations, not individual lawsuits. He added that no treaty can be used to pardon slavery, which violates many international treaties.</p>
        <p>Judge Vaughn Walker of the Federal District Court in San Francisco has recently given Mr. Yang and his team permission to begin depositions, even though he has not yet finally decided to certify the class-action suit. And here in Shenyang, the old men are ebullient that in three months it has gone this far.</p>
        <p>''These plaintiffs are old,'' Professor Zhang said. ''More die each year. There's no time to wait.''</p>
