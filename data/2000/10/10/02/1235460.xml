        <p>They left before the closing ceremony, flying to Honolulu for fuel and then on to Los Angeles, where varied connections did their part: Allan Houston to New York. Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway to Miami. Vince Carter to Toronto. Off to their own worlds.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be an adjustment, going back to the N.B.A. this quick,'' Houston said after the United States weathered two scares before leaving the 2000 Games with the gold medal in men's basketball.</p>
        <p>''The atmosphere of this whole trip has been laid back,'' Houston said. ''People having a great time. Golf. You're playing with the best players in the world. And now you get back to your normal life.''</p>
        <p>Listed on the junket USA Basketball planned to entice some of the world's best players were San Diego, Hawaii, Japan and Australia. Five weeks. Three continents. Thirteen games. All expenses paid.</p>
        <p>No one, of course, warned them about Lithuania, a roughneck bunch of 6-8 forwards in crew cuts, who nearly made history before losing to the Americans, 85-83, in the semifinals. Or the litany of foreign players who now identify a National Basketball Association All-Star as less of an icon and more the Guy Who Is Making More Than Me in America.</p>
        <p>No one warned them about the disapproving crowds in Australia, who jeered Carter when he preened after dunks, feeling he was rubbing it in; or about the international news media comparing them unfavorably with Michael, Magic and Larry. Reporters were standing and rooting for the swaggering millionaires to lose, if only because it would make a tremendous story.</p>
        <p>Some junket.</p>
        <p>The last few weeks of representing the United States made 12 players see themselves for who they really are: fine, skilled players with flaws, all of whom got along famously, but who had trouble blending seamlessly on the court and understanding that there is indeed basketball played outside the United States worth worrying about.</p>
        <p>''Something like this gives you a little humility, makes you understand that as big as you are, there is always someone who wants to be where you are,'' Houston said. ''I don't think all of us understood that sometimes.''</p>
        <p>With roughly the same amount of time to prepare as the men, the United States women's team played a selfless, nearly perfect game to win the gold medal by routing Australia on Saturday. Lisa Leslie and Sheryl Swoopes are Women's National Basketball Association stars, but they are not multimillionaires, or one-person entertainment conglomerates whose annual income dozens of people depend on. They are ballplayers, who happen to be some of the best in the world.</p>
        <p>Beyond the practices, games and leisure time, the United States men's team visited an Aboriginal community in the impoverished Redfern section of Sydney -- a visit many players said reminded them of poor urban areas in America. They walked into the opening ceremony to the loudest ovation they could remember, 110,000 people waving and chanting.</p>
        <p>Playing for the United States was hardly a vacation; it became more like going to the summer camp. They didn't want to go at first, but they returned home with a larger sense of the world.</p>
        <p>Carter came back with a meaner disposition, a player who got in your face if he felt you were trying to undercut him. He was out of line on a few occasions, but by the end of the Games he began to understand that not everyone was out to get him. One of his favorite moments involved a spectacular dunk over the 7-foot-2 Frenchman Frederic Weis in a preliminary game. But he had a better moment yesterday in the 85-75 gold medal victory over France.</p>
        <p>''The same thing was about to happen on the same side,'' Carter said of a first-half midair encounter with him and Weis. ''And this time he fouled me. And he looked at me and started smiling. That was the greatest thing ever because we weren't taking it on a personal level. We were just playing basketball.''</p>
        <p>Of his boorish behavior at times, Carter said: ''I just say I gave it my all. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. I think I was protecting myself because after all this is over, some of these guys go back and -- I don't know what they do, but I have to go back to the States, and I have a career to uphold and continue.''</p>
        <p>Mourning came back home a father, missing two games on the trip so he could witness the birth of his daughter, Myka Sydney, nearly 10,000 miles away in Miami, before returning for the medal round.</p>
        <p>Ray Allen, often overlooked, returned as one of the most complete, mature players in the game at merely 25 years old, a guard almost as explosive to the basket as Carter and as dangerous on the perimeter as Reggie Miller. He may be a Most Valuable Player in two years.</p>
        <p>Gary Payton and Vin Baker, who understand they cannot carry the load by themselves, returned to a new teammate, Patrick Ewing, who was dealt to Seattle nearly two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Shareef Abdur-Rahim came back a genuine winner, one who broke through the stigma of playing for a losing team in Vancouver. Steve Smith and Jason Kidd came home smiling, knowing they had imparted some of their class and integrity to a team sometimes found wanting in those areas.</p>
        <p>Houston returned with the first gold medal by a male athlete from Louisville since the kind, loquacious man who knows his mother and who stopped by his birthday party when he was 3.</p>
        <p>''Grand Avenue now has two gold medals,'' Houston said, smiling. ''I wouldn't even want my name mentioned in the same sentence with Ali, that's how much I think of him. But I suppose I'll take it. Because we earned it. We did earn it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, along with Carter, Antonio McDyess and Kevin Garnett returned with the knowledge that none of their teammates would have stood proudly on the medal podium yesterday in Sydney, gold medals around their necks, if they had not bailed out the team in the most important 45 seconds of their careers.</p>
        <p>In the crucible of the Olympic semifinals, the Americans were trailing by 1 point. But Carter converted a difficult jump shot along the baseline, Garnett stole the ball in the backcourt and McDyess grabbed a monstrous rebound and put it back for a score, preventing an unimaginable loss for American basketball.</p>
        <p>When they needed a basket, a stop, a rebound and a loose ball to save their pride, the game and, as Kidd said, ''our citizenship,'' those three young players came through.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is, because the games are little bit closer, people are saying, 'Aha, this team we've sent must not be this good,' '' said Russ Granik, the USA Basketball president and N.B.A. deputy commissioner. ''I think what's really happening is the rest of the world is getting better. The more they play against us, the less afraid they are. The more they're now coming out to play basketball, as opposed to '92, when it was like they felt like they were playing against the gods.''</p>
        <p>Houston to New York. Mourning and Hardaway to Miami. Carter to Toronto. The basketball gods came home last night, humble and more human than ever.</p>
