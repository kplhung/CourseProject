        <p>The accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young said it would spin off its online corporate-training operations this week as part of a strategy to become a dominant player in the crowded online corporate-training industry.</p>
        <p>Ernst &amp; Young hopes that the newly independent training company, Intellinex L.L.C., will be able to grow more rapidly through acquisitions than it could if it remained a part of the parent firm. At the moment, there are believed to be about 5,000 players, large and small, in the online business-training industry, with new entrants appearing almost weekly. No single company is yet believed to hold more than 5 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>Analysts say the market for online employee-training courses -- often referred to as e-training -- is doubling every year with little sign of a slow-down. Cushing Anderson, an analyst with the International Data Corporation who follows e-training, estimates that the market has already doubled since 1998, when it was worth about $550 million. He predicts it will reach $11 billion by 2003.</p>
        <p>At the moment, only an estimated 11 percent of corporate-training programs are conducted through computer interactions, video streaming or other online means. But International Data, which researches technology and e-business trends, predicts that online training will soon steal market share away from business training courses that use teachers and classrooms.</p>
        <p>''It's just pervasive,'' said H. Michael Boyd, an International Data analyst who follows human-resources issues. But Mr. Boyd added that he did not believe online training would ever fully replace instruction by live teachers in classrooms.</p>
        <p>Although vendors say it is possible to teach such ''soft'' skills as sales techniques and leadership styles online, much of the current market growth is being driven by incessant changes in business technology. Richard S. Bobrow, chief executive of the Americas division of Ernst &amp; Young, said last year's Year 2000 computer jitters prompted many large American businesses to overhaul their business software, and at the time, the software companies were too busy filling orders to train customers' employees.</p>
        <p>Some of Ernst &amp; Young's clients asked the firm to conduct training, Mr. Bobrow said, and Ernst &amp; Young quickly spotted a business opportunity.</p>
        <p>''We said, 'We have a capability that is very important to other companies,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Ernst &amp; Young had developed its own online training programs to train auditors who were working outside the United States and needed to be kept current on the firm's standard auditing procedures. The firm found it less expensive to train them online than to fly them home for repeated training sessions.</p>
        <p>The Year 2000 concerns gave Ernst &amp; Young an occasion to refine its curriculum-development procedures, said Michael Powers, who will be chairman and chief executive of Intellinex. Before, it might have taken 200 hours to produce just one hour of online instruction, he said, but now it takes just 20 hours.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers said he expected Intellinex to have revenues of more than $100 million in its first year of independent operations, which he said would make it one of the three largest providers in the industry.</p>
        <p>He predicted that the industry would consolidate in the next three to five years, and that during this time Intellinex would gain market share by acquiring speciality training companies, or forming business alliances, to offer a full line of training courses to customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd, the analyst, said the plan had its logic. ''There are so many companies out there doing little niche things,'' he said. ''The logic is pretty well accepted of saying, 'Let's go out and suck them up so we don't have to build them ourselves.' ''</p>
        <p>But while he said a provider that assembled an array of such products  ''would have a premier capability,''  he questioned whether such a large company could be operated in a way that fulfilled online training's promise of low costs.</p>
