        <p>The election for New York City mayor is a full 13 months away, but yesterday, the race claimed its latest casualty: William J. Bratton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton, the former police commissioner and one of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's favorite sparring partners these days, said in an interview that he had decided against running next year, as a Republican. After talking to political consultants, fund-raisers and friends -- and, not incidentally, after taking a poll -- he said he had determined that he was too much of a long shot to make it worth entering the race.</p>
        <p>''On my end it really came down to the idea, was this the time in my life to be doing this?'' Mr. Bratton, 52, said in an interview. ''Timing is everything. I've concluded that this is simply not the time to run.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton said the decision was as much a bow to political reality as to his own desires. He said that while polls he reviewed convinced him that  he could be a strong candidate, ''all the stars in the constellation would have to line up to make it happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton had seen in this race an opening, a narrow one, created by Mr. Giuliani's departure next year from City Hall. Mr. Giuliani is prohibited from seeking a third term.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Mr. Bratton had seen himself as potentially the next Giuliani. He, too, while presenting himself as a Republican, would have counted on capturing the support of enough other parties (though almost certainly not the Democrats) to  present himself as a fusion candidate. He, too, had never run for public office before, as was the case in Mr. Giuliani's first and unsuccessful bid for mayor in 1989.</p>
        <p>And, most of all, Mr. Bratton is nearly as identified with the drop in the crime rate in New York City as is Mr. Giuliani himself. Indeed, it was the question of which man deserved credit for that decline that led to their very public estrangement.</p>
        <p>''I'm probably one of the most well-known public safety figures, not only in the country, but around the world,'' Mr. Bratton said, in describing why he thought he would have been an appealing candidate for office. And he scoffed at the notion that crime would not be the issue it once was, given the drop in the crime rate.</p>
        <p>''The concern now is a different concern; people feel the city is much safer, so their concern is that they're worried about slippage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He was the second potential candidate to have dropped out before ever dropping in. Fran Reiter, a former deputy mayor, considered running in the crowded Democratic field, but she dropped out in February.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton, who said he had no plans to endorse anyone for mayor for the time being, said he had not given up on the hope of getting back into public life, either by running for office or by being appointed to a government job. For now, he said, he will continue to run his own public safety consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani had seemed less than thrilled at the idea of Mr. Bratton attempting to succeed him, and said, fairly directly, that he would do what he could to make sure that it never happened. ''The Republican mayor of New York City will do everything he can to oppose you,'' Mr. Giuliani warned at a news conference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton said Mr. Giuliani's threats had not scared him a bit.</p>
        <p>''We've been at odds since I left as commissioner,'' he said. ''Those attacks were not unanticipated and had really no bearing on this particular decision. Nor would they have been an issue of concern going forward.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton said, given the mayor's own standing with his party after his sudden and dramatic exit from the race for Senate, there probably would not have been much Mr. Giuliani could have done to persuade Republican leaders not to back Mr. Bratton. The mayor's clout, Mr. Bratton said, was likely to fade as the election approached.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bratton said that he did not like all the feuding, and said that had he entered the race he would have tried to start a new era in the Bratton-Giuliani relationship.</p>
        <p>''I would have actively sought, had I gotten into this, to seek a reconciliation and an understanding with the mayor,'' Mr. Bratton said. ''As to whether or not that would have happened -- well, my potential candidacy would not have been based on that happening. Hope springs eternal.''</p>
        <p>And will he seek that reconciliation now that he is staying out of politics? ''At this juncture, it's not the first thing in my mind,'' Mr. Bratton said last night.</p>
