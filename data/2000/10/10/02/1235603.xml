        <p>MURPHY-Thomas P. Age 77, of Highlands, NJ, died Saturday, September 30, 2000 at Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch. He was a retired Circulation Manager of The New York Times and President of The Newspaper Guild, retiring in 1988. After retiring from the paper, he worked for 10 years with the Monmouth Park Racetrack. Mr. Murphy was a communicant of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Highlands. He was also a member of the Lions Club of Highlands, VFW of Highlands, the American Legion Post 143, President of the ''Gravelly Point Beach Association,'' the Knights of Columbus in Brooklyn, and a former Councilman of Highlands. He served his country during World War II in the Navy. Born in Manhattan, he lived in Brooklyn for 20 years where he started the first block association in Bay Ridge before moving to Highlands 31 years ago. Anyone whoever encountered him will always remember that the only thing bigger than his smile was his heart. He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Mary Murphy; son Michael Murphy; daughter-in-law Carol Murphy, son George Murphy; daughter Patricia Murphy, all of Highlands; brother James Murphy of Ridgefield Park, NJ; six grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. Funeral services will be held 11 AM, Tuesday at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church, 141 Navesink Ave, Highlands, where a Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated. Interment will be in Fairview Cemetery, Red Bank. The family will receive their friends 2-4 and 7-9 PM, Monday, at John P. Condon Funeral Home, 804 State Highway 36, Leonardo.</p>
