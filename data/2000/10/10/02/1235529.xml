        <p>When General Manager Scott Layden declared 12 days ago that the Patrick Ewing trade would be the Knicks' last before training camp, his words were met with disbelief, not only among those attending that day's news conference at Madison Square Garden, but also among the Knicks' 28 competitors in the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>But Layden was not being deceptive or dramatic. He was telling the truth.</p>
        <p>So tomorrow, after months of searching for ways to improve their rebounding, the Knicks will begin training at SUNY Purchase with an even poorer collection of rebounders than they had last season, when they were 24th in the league. The Knicks will move their training camp to Charleston, S.C., later in the week.</p>
        <p>Five months after Coach Jeff Van Gundy lamented that his team was ''structurally flawed,'' the Knicks have all the symmetry of mismatched socks. And after a season and a summer of complaining privately about Ewing's diminished ability and bothersome presence, the Knicks will begin with a group of centers who can only dream about matching him on his worst day.</p>
        <p>Like it or not, believe it or not, the Knicks will start the preseason as Layden said they would -- without Dikembe Mutombo or any other remotely dominating player over 6 feet 8 inches tall. After 15 seasons of working from the inside out, the Knicks are as inept in the post as they were on the wings during the leanest years of the Ewing era.</p>
        <p>The situation grew even more dire on Saturday, when Luc Longley, Ewing's projected replacement in the starting lineup, injured his right knee while representing Australia in an Olympic semifinal game against France. The Knicks will not comment on Longley's injury until their team physician, Norman Scott, examines him this week, but the early projections have Longley missing at least two months.</p>
        <p>Not that Longley is the answer for what ails the Knicks. Before his injury, he was being outplayed by Frederic Weis, the needs-much-work French center the Knicks selected with the 15th pick of the 1999 draft. Weis balked at joining the Knicks' summer league team, saying he was not yet ready to play in the N.B.A. He looked more than ready against Longley, posting 11 points and 11 rebounds against the Australians.</p>
        <p>Without Longley, the Knicks have this choice at center: Marcus Camby or Kurt Thomas, both power forwards, or Travis Knight, the reed-thin center who is best suited for backup duty.</p>
        <p>The Knicks are almost certain to make a strong run at Joe Smith, the talented though thus far disappointing power forward whose contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves is expected to be voided this week.</p>
        <p>While there are several reasons for Knicks fans to be pessimistic, mustering optimism is not impossible. In the past, the Knicks have proven they can win without Ewing. If Camby can stay healthy and regain the form he displayed in helping the Knicks reach the N.B.A. finals in 1999, the Knicks could enjoy at least as much success as they had last season.</p>
        <p>In Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston and Glen Rice, the Knicks can match up with anyone outside, but Van Gundy must find a way to make the most out of all three players. Rice will have to come off the bench, and it remains to be seen whether he can accept such a role for the first time in his 11-year career.</p>
        <p>Unless Van Gundy works some quick magic, rumors will hover over the Knicks until the trading deadline in February. At least for now, the Knicks will have to find a way to turn the great outside shooting of Houston and Rice, the fearless slashing to the basket of Sprewell and the horrible rebounding of its front line into a winning combination.</p>
