        <p>'Tucker'  NBC, tonight at 8:30</p>
        <p>The opening gag of ''Tucker,'' a new sitcom that NBC offers tonight, is so tasteless that it may take casual viewers a moment to decode it; it's not the kind of thing one expects to see on a show billed as ''a coming-of-age family comedy.'' Don't worry if you miss the first reference, though, because the best these oafish writers can do is reintroduce the offensive bit again and again. The gag won't be detailed here, but picture a 14-year-old telling Viagra jokes, and you've got the idea.</p>

        <p>The ''Tucker'' interpretation of ''coming of age'' is all hormonal, making the show a sorry imitation of its betters in the genre. Eli Marienthal is Tucker, the 14-year-old; Noelle Beck is his newly divorced mother; Katey Sagal is the aunt/ sister they move in with; Alison Lohman is the lust object who lives next door (happily, she declines Tucker's invitation to take off her shirt, at least in the first episode), and all of them should be quarantined immediately.</p>
