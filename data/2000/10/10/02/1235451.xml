        <p>Last April, SAS Institute, the designer of data analysis software that is the world's largest privately held software company, said it would go public in 12 to 18 months.

        <p>This may be the antithesis of Internet time.</p>
        <p>Last April, SAS Institute, the designer of data analysis software that is the world's largest privately held software company, said it would go public in 12 to 18 months. The talk was of a valuation above $20 billion for the company, based in Cary, N.C., because of its revenue of over $1 billion last year, a long track record of solid profits, a balance sheet free of debt and a projected annual growth rate of more than 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The result would be a $4 billion offering if, as SAS has suggested, up to 20 percent of the company was sold.</p>
        <p>Unlike the profitless start-ups that rush to make an initial public offering, SAS -- founded 24 years ago -- is clearly in no hurry. To be sure, Andre Boisvert, SAS's recently named president and chief operating officer, says his main assignment is preparing for the transition to becoming a public company. And Mr. Boisvert has said he is eager to be able to use stock rather than SAS's cash to acquire other software vendors and bolster incentives for employees.</p>
        <p>But last week he said that SAS still had plenty of work ahead in developing the kind of accounting systems and making the improvements in efficiency the company would need to meet its projections for investors. ''My time frame is 18 months,'' he said after a recent chat with Goldman, Sachs, the investment bank that is likely to lead the offering.</p>
        <p>That would push the big plunge  well into 2002.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Boisvert is unlikely to get orders to speed things up from James Goodnight, the frugal 57-year-old former academic who founded SAS with three colleagues and now owns two-thirds of it. Mr. Goodnight, who is chairman and chief executive, has no apparent need to cash out. Forbes Magazine recently listed him as the nation's 29th richest man, estimating that his holdings in SAS and other assets totaled $8 billion.</p>
