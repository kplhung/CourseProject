        <p>THE Polls as Good.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the proliferation of polls, people are better informed.</p>
        <p>Campaign operatives can no longer get away with peddling favorable, skewed tidbits from their polls, and the public develops insights into political machinations because journalists now learn what only political insiders used to know. We all have a better sense of the public's attitude toward issues and we learn counterintuitive things, like President Clinton's steady approval rating throughout the Monica mess.</p>
        <p>The Polls as Bad.</p>
        <p>They can be wrong. (Some must be; otherwise, how to explain different polls showing both George W. Bush and Al Gore slightly ahead of each other, and Hillary Rodham Clinton beating Rick A. Lazio and in a dead heat with him?) They can be misinterpreted. They can be biased. They can fail to catch up with a changing electorate. They can be based on the wrong data. And they are not the election.</p>
        <p>For some reason (The impatience of the remote-control generation? The demands of the perpetual news cycle?) we seem to need to know who won months before an election. So polls are a constant, and take on a life of their own. ''They become part of the story,'' says Mickey Blum, president of Blum &amp; Weprin Associates, a company that is polling in this year's New York Senate race. ''Obviously each time somebody is ahead, somebody has to respond, plus the media make one person look like a genius and the other look terrible.''</p>
        <p>Just yesterday, Tim Russert of NBC began his ''Meet the Press'' interview of Mr. Lazio with a question about how polls show him and Mrs. Clinton doing among women. The possibility that the polls were wrong or outdated wasn't even raised.</p>
        <p>But polls are off sometimes. In the 1993 race for New Jersey governor, most polls had Jim Florio well ahead of Christine Todd Whitman throughout the campaign, even two days before the election. She won. Reporters had been ''mesmerized'' by the polls, as an article in The New York Times put it, and treated Mr. Florio, the incumbent, as the front-runner. Post-mortems blamed political experts for assuming that Mr. Florio would get more undecided votes than he did. In fact, voters who are undecided late in a campaign have usually rejected the incumbent, a known quantity.</p>
        <p>The same phenomenon emerged in the 1998 Senate race between Representative Charles E. Schumer and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Most polls showed the race too close to call, or gave Mr. Schumer a slight edge. But once again the incumbent lost the lion's share of undecided votes, and Mr. Schumer won by 9 percentage points.</p>
        <p>A poll can also be distorted based on the seemingly simple but critical calculation of who will vote. Right now in the Lazio-Clinton race, all polls show Mrs. Clinton way ahead in heavily Democratic New York City, which accounted for only about 31 percent of the state vote in recent elections.</p>
        <p>Last week's Newsday/Channel 11 poll, taken by Princeton Survey Research Associates, assumed a 33 percent city vote, 22 percent suburban vote and 45 percent upstate vote. The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll went with 31/26/43. The New York Times/CBS News Poll assumed 31 percent city, 24 percent suburban and 45 percent upstate. If the race is close, those seemingly slight differences could matter.</p>
        <p>TURNOUT is another factor; only 47 percent of New Yorkers aged 18 and over voted in the presidential race four years ago. But recent polls, all but one of which give Mrs. Clinton a lead of 7 to 10 percentage points, assume larger turnouts: 50 percent (the Newsday/Channel 11 poll); 60 percent (the Times/CBS News Poll); 66 percent (the Quinnipiac poll). The latest Marist College poll, which had the two candidates in a dead heat, assumed a turnout of 50.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac poll, said it ''is supposed to predict how people will vote, not how many.''</p>
        <p>But sometimes turnout does matter. In 1996, nationwide polls predicted that President Clinton would win by as much as 16 points, based on a presumed turnout of about 55 percent (as in 1992). But the turnout was 49 percent, and broke heavily Republican; Mr. Clinton's margin over Bob Dole was 8 percentage points, not 16.</p>
        <p>''If actual voters split the same way as the likely voters in polls, it doesn't matter where you draw the line,'' said Michael R. Kagay, news surveys editor of The Times. ''But they didn't in 1996, and it made a huge difference.''</p>
        <p>So we argue for the obvious. Read the polls. Raise an eyebrow. And wait for Election Day, when some percentage of Americans will vote -- without benefit of remote control.</p>
