        <p>At first glance, the Supreme Court term that opens on Monday figures to be a pale imitation of the blockbuster term that concluded in June.</p>
        <p>After all, there is no abortion case on the docket this time, no Miranda, no school prayer, no gay rights. There are federalism cases, but the debate over limits on Congressional authority by now has a familiar ring. And just days ago, the justices decided to sidestep the one case that would surely have put the term on the map, Microsoft's appeal in the government's antitrust case.</p>
        <p>Despite all that, this is a term that in its own, perhaps less flashy way might well measure up to the last one for cases of far-reaching consequence.</p>
        <p>Among the 47 cases the justices have accepted for argument -- possibly 30 more will be added in the next few months -- is a case under the Clean Air Act that offers what may be the most significant test of government regulation in decades.</p>
        <p>One of the new federalism cases, on whether states may be sued for violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, could prove to be the most important in the series of recent cases in which the justices have carved out a widening area of state immunity from the reach of federal statutes.</p>
        <p>In addition, a Congressional redistricting case from North Carolina gives the court a final chance before the next round of post-census reapportionment to clarify its position on the role of race in the drawing of district lines.</p>
        <p>And in a First Amendment challenge to restrictions on the kind of advocacy that lawyers in federally financed legal services programs can offer clients, the court will revisit the increasingly important issue of what strings can be attached to government grants.</p>
        <p>The justices who enter the courtroom at 10 o'clock on Monday morning will be taking their seats in the glare of an election-year spotlight. They have served together for more than six years. The interval since Justice Stephen G. Breyer took the oath on Aug. 3, 1994, is the longest period without change in the court's makeup since the early 19th century. No justice has given any indication of retirement plans, but the sense that change is inevitable, even if not imminent, permeates the opening of the term this year.</p>
        <p>Following are some of the new term's most important cases:</p>
        <p>Congressional Authority</p>
        <p>A series of 5-to-4 decisions in the last four years has constricted the ability of Congress to apply various federal laws to the states. Last year, for example, the court ruled that states may not be sued for discriminating against older workers. This term, the question is whether states may be sued for violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, a far-reaching statute that requires all employers to accommodate the needs of qualified workers with disabilities and places special anti-discrimination obligations on public agencies.</p>
        <p>The case, University of Alabama v. Garrett, No. 99-1240, is highly significant because it poses a direct challenge to Congress's authority to enforce the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment.</p>
        <p>In the age discrimination case last year, the majority said there was insufficient evidence that age discrimination by state employers was a problem so serious as to justify breaching the states' constitutional immunity from damage suits in federal court. Consequently, in the new case, supporters of the disability act, including the Clinton administration, historians and disability rights advocates, have mounted a major effort to document for the court the extent to which states themselves have discriminated against people with disabilities, from denial of access to polling places to involuntary institutionalization and even sterilization.</p>
        <p>The historical record is striking, but whether it will prove conclusive is an open question. The case also poses an important question about how far beyond the 14th Amendment's nondiscrimination command Congress may may go in devising remedies or preventive measures. In requiring not only relief from active discrimination but affirmative acts of accommodation, the Americans With Disabilities Act goes further than what the equal protection guarantee itself requires. Whether it goes too far may depend, in turn, on where the court ranks disability in the hierarchy of equal protection.</p>
        <p>It is clear, for example, that age discrimination receives the lowest judicial scrutiny and racial discrimination the highest. There is some ambiguity in the court's precedents over whether disability discrimination ranks at the bottom or somewhere in between, another question that this complex and far-reaching case may answer.</p>
        <p>A second case challenges an exercise of Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce, in this instance under the Clean Water Act. The question in Solid Waste Agency v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, No. 99-1178, is the validity of a regulation known as the ''migratory bird rule,'' under which the government has asserted authority to regulate small intrastate wetlands that are habitats for migratory birds.</p>
        <p>The court's recent precedents have emphasized that activity regulated under the Commerce Clause must itself have a substantial impact on commerce. In this case, a federal appeals court upheld the regulation on the basis of the cumulative economic effect of the millions of people who travel across state lines to hunt or watch migratory birds.</p>
        <p>While the case could be resolved on statutory grounds, a constitutional ruling that directly rejects this ''cumulative effects'' test would further restrict Congress's discretion beyond the context of this dispute.</p>
        <p>Federal Regulation</p>
        <p>The federal appeals court here set off shock waves last year when it invalidated the Environmental Protection Agency's new standards for smog and soot under the Clean Air Act. Reviving an analysis that had fallen into disuse since the New Deal, the appeals court said that by failing to give the agency meaningful limits on the setting of standards, Congress had delegated too much legislative authority to the executive branch.</p>
        <p>Since many administrative agencies operate within broad and vague grants of authority, this unexpected judicial revival of the ''nondelegation'' doctrine could have major consequences. The Clinton administration appealed the ruling in Browner v. American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the industry groups that challenged the new standards have offered an alternative argument to the Supreme Court: that the Clean Air Act should be reinterpreted as requiring that regulations be justified under a cost-benefit analysis, and that such a requirement would remove the law from under the constitutional cloud of the appeals court's nondelegation analysis. The industry case is American Trucking Associations v. Browner, No. 99-1426.</p>
        <p>Criminal Law</p>
        <p>The docket contains an unusual number of criminal cases, with five raising substantial issues under the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure.</p>
        <p>Ferguson v. City of Charleston, No. 99-936, is a challenge to the South Carolina city's program under which selected obstetrics patients at a municipal hospital were tested for cocaine use, with positive findings turned over to the local police. Among the 10 plaintiffs are women who were arrested and taken to jail almost immediately after giving birth. The Fourth Amendment question is whether the urine tests performed without warrants were unconstitutional searches or whether, as the city argues, they were justified by a ''special need,'' beyond the bounds of ordinary law enforcement, to protect fetal health.</p>
        <p>The question in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, No. 99-1030, is the validity of a drug-interdiction checkpoint in which trained drug-detecting dogs sniffed the cars of motorists stopped on a city street. A federal appeals court rejected the city's argument that because the checkpoints served a ''special need'' of protecting health and safety, they should not be held to the same constitutional standard as a typical law enforcement program, which would require the police to have a reason to suspect wrongdoing before stopping a car.</p>
        <p>Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, No. 99-1408, asks the court to decide in a Texas case whether the Fourth Amendment bars a full custodial arrest for an offense -- failure to use a seat belt -- that carries no more than a $50 fine. The question in Kyllo v. United States, No. 99-8508, is whether use of a thermal imaging device, used to detect the heat that is often the byproduct of a home-growing marijuana operation, is a search that requires a warrant. Finally, in Illinois v. McArthur, No. 99-1132, the court will decide whether the police can secure a home from the outside, preventing the occupant's re-entry while they obtain a warrant to search the premises.</p>
        <p>Redistricting</p>
        <p>The court will scrutinize North Carolina's 12th Congressional District for the fourth time since 1993, when a decision called Shaw v. Reno rattled the political system by indicating that districts drawn predominantly on the basis of racial considerations are presumptively unconstitutional. The district was drawn after the 1990 census in order to elect a black congressman, the first in  North Carolina since Reconstruction.</p>
        <p>After the earlier decisions, the district is now somewhat more compact and contains a majority of whites. Nonetheless, a three-judge federal district court invalidated it again earlier this year. Now called Hunt v. Cromartie, No. 99-1864, the case raises the question of how a court, reviewing the record of a district's creation, is supposed to tell whether impermissible racial considerations or permissible political motives, like protecting incumbents, were predominant when the Legislature made its choices.</p>
        <p>Free Speech</p>
        <p>In a 1996 budget bill, Congress put new limits on lawyers who receive money from the Legal Services Corporation to represent poor people. While the lawyers may still represent welfare recipients in seeking benefits on a case-by-case basis, they may not challenge any welfare law or regulation. The question in Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, No. 99-603, is whether this restriction amounts to an unconstitutional restriction on speech critical of government policy, as a federal appeals court found.</p>
        <p>The court will decide whether journalists may be sued under the federal wiretap law for disclosing the contents of communications they have reason to suspect were illegally intercepted. In this case, Bartnicki v. Vopper, No. 99-1687, a radio talk show host in Pennsylvania, played a tape of a private cell phone conversation that had been anonymously delivered to him. The two parties to the conversation sued. A federal appeals court held that as the passive receiver of newsworthy information, journalists could not be punished under the wiretap law, despite the privacy interests at stake.</p>
        <p>Expanded Information Online</p>
        <p>In time for the new term, the Supreme Court has expanded the information that is available on www.supremecourtus.gov, its new Web site. The site now provides a searchable database of the court's docket, showing the procedural history of all pending and recently decided cases.</p>
        <p>The Oyez project of Northwestern University, named for the marshal's cry when the justices enter the courtroom, has expanded its Web site, oyez.northwestern .edu, to include information about the current docket, as well as links to lower court opinions and briefs and an archive of more than 1,500 hours of Supreme Court arguments.</p>
        <p>The Politics section of The New York Times on the Web (www .nytimes.com/politics) contains links to a Supreme Court Guide with a connection to the FindLaw databases of recent Supreme Court opinions, orders and briefs in pending cases.</p>
