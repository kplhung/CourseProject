        <p>Ecompanies, an Internet incubator, is expected to announce on Monday that it is combining its venture capital arm with the new economy operations of Evercore Capital Partners, a boutique investment firm in New York.</p>
        <p>Austin Beutner, a founding partner at Evercore -- which advised CBS on its merger with Viacom and has investments in, among other things, the owner of The National Enquirer -- has been named chief executive of the new group. It is to be called Ecompanies-Evercore Venture Partners, said Jake Winebaum, co-founder of Ecompanies. Mr. Beutner will remain a senior partner at Evercore and be based in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The move is an interesting one, especially for the year-old Ecompanies, which provides soup-to-nuts services for bringing companies to market in as little as 60 days, but has yet to prove such a strategy is financially successful. In recent months, other more established venture capital firms have begun working with old economy financial buyers, like Evercore, who make their money by taking stakes in companies they help run.</p>
        <p>Most notably, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, famous for the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco, teamed up with Accel Partners, a technology investment firm based in Palo Alto, Calif. But younger private concerns like Ecompanies have been dogged by Wall Street as investors become more finicky about what ideas they will support. Ecompanies Venture Group already has $160 million under management. But this summer, industry analysts said it ran into resistance when it tried to raise a second round of financing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winebaum said he met his longtime friend Mr. Beutner when they were classmates at Dartmouth in the early 1980's. In April, when the two were on a skiing trip, Mr. Winebaum said the idea came up that the two work together. ''There is a lot of rationale for doing this,'' Mr. Winebaum said. ''The Internet as a concept will disappear in two to three years as it becomes more integrated. New companies need Old Economy expertise.''</p>
        <p>What they need most these days are relationships with old economy concerns, especially as companies like Wal-Mart and Toys ''R'' Us have become smarter in building their own Internet strategies and are challenging Web upstarts. ''Evercore can help us there,'' Mr. Winebaum said. He would not say how big a stake Evercore will have in the operations. But in addition to being chief executive of the new group, Mr. Buetner will also become the third partner in Ecompanies.</p>
