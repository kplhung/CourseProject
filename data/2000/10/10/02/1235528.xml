        <p>Coach Ron Low singled out the rookie defenseman Mike Mottau again for his play as the Rangers ended their preseason schedule with a 2-1 victory over the Islanders today at the Hartford Civic Center.</p>
        <p>Mottau -- who had no goals, one assist and two penalty minutes in six games -- opened plenty of eyes with his play, but he may find himself making the two-hour drive back up to Hartford very soon. The Rangers have until Wednesday to sign Mottau, something both sides agreed upon when Mottau joined the team without a contract after missing the start of training camp.</p>
        <p>If the 22-year-old Mottau does agree to terms by Wednesday, it is quite possible that he will begin the season in Hartford with the Rangers' American Hockey League affiliate. The Rangers open their season on Saturday night at Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''I think the kid has played well,'' Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, said. ''He has good vision. He's not overly physical, but he's a smart player. I think he's going to play.''</p>
        <p>The question is where.</p>
        <p>''He's not going to step in and be a star in the National Hockey League right off,'' Sather said. ''But he's certainly a step ahead of people in the intelligence department already. He's a good prospect, let's put it that way. I'm happy he made the decision to come to camp.''</p>
        <p>Unless Brian Leetch's sore groin is more problematic than Low believes, Mottau will most likely begin the season in Hartford -- if he and the Rangers can reach an agreement.</p>
        <p>''Mottau's a guy who can go to the minors without requiring waivers,'' Low said. Neither Dale Purinton nor Jason Doig, two of the Rangers' other young defensemen, can do the same.</p>
        <p>Mottau said he would not oppose an assignment to Hartford. ''I just have to deal with whatever decision they make,'' said Mottau, who won the Hobey Baker award -- United States college hockey's equivalent of the Heisman Trophy -- last season at Boston College. ''I just want to play hockey. And if I play well and things work out, I will hopefully be with the Rangers as soon as possible.''</p>
        <p>The main sticking point to a contract remains Mottau's guaranteed signing bonus. The Rangers have offered $550,000.</p>
        <p>''I'm confident we can get something done,'' Mottau said today. ''Not being in training camp, they don't know if you can play. And I feel comfortable with the way I played. I showed what I can do at this level.''</p>
        <p>There is still a slim chance that Mottau might open the season with the Rangers. Not only is Leetch hurt, but so is Rich Pilon, who has a sore left thumb. And Vladimir Malakhov faces a possible suspension after receiving a game misconduct for checking Eric Cairns into the corner boards today.</p>
        <p>Cairns, who crumpled to the ice after hitting the boards face-first, escaped with just a neck strain. Malakhov insisted that the hit was not intentional, and Low said that videotape bore out Malakhov's statement.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JAN HLAVAC and VLADIMIR KAMENSKY scored on the power play for the Rangers against the Islanders, while KIRK McLEAN stopped 39 of 40 shots. KENNY JONSSON scored on the power play for the Islanders. The Rangers finished the preseason 3-4-2. The Islanders, who end their preseason against the Devils in New Jersey on Monday, are 0-4-1, but their last three defeats have all been by one goal.</p>
        <p>The Rangers' DALE PURINTON, 6 feet 2, racked up 24 penalty minutes Sunday after fighting ZDENO CHARA, 6-9, twice. That gave Purinton a whopping 74 penalty minutes in five preseason games. Prorated over an 82-game N.H.L. regular season, that would put Purinton at 1,214 penalty minutes, which would shatter the league record.</p>
        <p>It is quite possible that none of the Rangers' top three prospects, all forwards, will be on their opening roster. MANNY MALHOTRA could begin the season in Hartford, although he could be recalled at any time. PAVEL BRENDL and JAMIE LUNDMARK look to be headed back to Canada for another season in juniors. ''I don't think they hurt their cause with their play in camp,'' said GLEN SATHER, referring to Brendl and Lundmark. ''But they haven't helped it a great deal, either. They're kids that need time. The question is whether we think they're going to develop more here. And if they stay, they're not going to get as much playing time as they need.'' As for Malhotra, Sather said, ''He's another guy who has to play to develop.''</p>
