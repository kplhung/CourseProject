        <p>More and more newspapers have begun using bylines and afterlines that include journalist's e-mail address or phone number or both as form of community outreach, invitation to chat and to pass on news; some are using bylines to extend credit to editors; photo (M)</p>

        <p>HI. I'm your reporter. My name is Felicity. This is my editor, Dave. We're going to serve you reports on the media today. Do you want to chat about them? Do you want to recommend something that's not on the menu? Just let us know.</p>
        <p>I know, I know. This is a newspaper, not a pseudocheery California salad bar.

        <p>HI. I'm your reporter. My name is Felicity. This is my editor, Dave. We're going to serve you reports on the media today. Do you want to chat about them? Do you want to recommend something that's not on the menu? Just let us know.</p>
        <p>I know, I know. This is a newspaper, not a pseudocheery California salad bar. But over the last two years, more and more newspapers have begun using bylines and afterlines as a form of community outreach, an invitation to chat, to pass on news, to see the human face of the institution.</p>
        <p>The proximate cause, say editors like Tonnie Katz of The Orange County Register, is that out-of-town owners and itinerant journalists at most newspapers share little or no history with their readers.</p>
        <p>Decades ago, she worked on her hometown newspaper in Lowell, Mass. ''I wrote wedding announcements one summer,'' Ms. Katz said. ''I knew a lot of the people.'' Now the only people a journalist is likely to know as well as her readers are the characters in ''Friends.''</p>
        <p>So the byline is serving a new function, not just a badge of authorship but something like a conventioneer's identification badge, lacking only the words ''Hello, My Name Is.''</p>
        <p>At The Register, many articles are preceded or followed by a reporter's e-mail address or phone number or both. The same is true at The Oregonian in Portland, Ore., at The Miami Herald, The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va., The St. Paul Pioneer-Press and a growing number of newspapers.</p>
        <p>N. Christian Anderson III, The Register's publisher and chief executive, said the e-mail addresses are becoming news-gathering aids more than complaint boxes.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden people can actually get hold of you,'' he said. ''We get lots and lots of responses by e-mail, because it's easy to do. Reporters develop new sources.''</p>
        <p>At The Gazette in Colorado Springs, bylines are still being used mostly as a badge of authorship. But the authorship is now collective. As in:</p>
        <p>NOISE UNDER FIRE  By Pam Zubeck/The Gazette</p>
        <p>Edited by Jim Borden; headline by Gary Houy</p>
        <p>For those who find newspaper collaborations arcane, this means that Mr. Borden vetted Ms. Zubeck's piece. Mr. Houy looked for any errors of grammar, spelling or balance. Then he wrote the headline, ''Noise Under Fire.''</p>
        <p>Now, nit-pickers know that an honest accounting might go more like this:</p>
        <p>NOISE UNDER FIRE  By Pam Zubeck/The Gazette</p>
        <p>Edited by Jim Borden; kibbitzing by Nell, who</p>
        <p>read Pam's article because it was more interest-</p>
        <p>ing than what she was supposed to be editing.</p>
        <p>Headline by John Doe, the copy desk chief, who</p>
        <p>didn't like Gary's original headline.</p>
        <p>Steven Smith, former editor of The Gazette, said he started the new system to give credit to all members of the journalistic team. Mr. Smith, now editor of The Statesman Journal in Salem, Ore., said the most resistance came from copy editors,  who feared they would be inundated with calls.</p>
        <p>It did not happen.</p>
        <p>Mitchell Stephens, professor of mass communications at New York University, says that for most of the four centuries that newspapers have existed, only the editor's name was known. ''You bought Horace Greeley's paper, or you bought Ben Franklin's paper,'' he said. Bylines, he added, were often pseudonyms. Admitting authorship ''was a sure way to get yourself in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Hi. I'm Felicity. I may be away. Just call Dave.</p>
