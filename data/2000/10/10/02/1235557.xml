        <p>He lauded President Kennedy and excoriated Southern segregationists. He urged Congress to tackle New Frontier legislation and lectured Yale University's president on the First Amendment. He called for a national no-smoking campaign -- in 1964 -- and a ban on boxing.</p>
        <p>He was Joseph I. Lieberman, the 21-year-old chairman and chief editorial writer of the student-run Yale Daily News. During his reign in the early 60's, when tweed jackets and crew cuts were stylish and Yale students were all male and mostly white, Mr. Lieberman handed down opinions the way any self-respecting Ivy League liberal would: often and at length.</p>
        <p>In dozens of editorial columns Mr. Lieberman published between October 1962 and January 1964, during his sophomore and junior years at Yale, he opined on everything from increasing the number of sock hops to Nikita Khrushchev's nuclear policy.</p>
        <p>Though occasionally consumed by campus esoterica, most of the columns show that Mr. Lieberman in college was an early version of Mr. Lieberman in Congress: preoccupied with the same kinds of issues that he would later grapple with as Connecticut's attorney general, a United States senator and vice-presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>He often praised the policies of John F. Kennedy in his writings and criticized the Democratic-led Congress for not embracing them more heartily. He said labor unions were ''a little fat around the midsection'' from their reluctance to fit into an increasingly automated society. He lavished an entire column on an ailing Pope John XXIII, saying, ''The extension of his love and charity has not been confined within the walls of the Church.''</p>
        <p>As the elected chairman of The Yale Daily News, Mr. Lieberman had the power to decide where his words would appear, and three times his columns appeared on the front page. Sometimes his opinions were printed in type smaller than that used for other articles, apparently to fit in everything Mr. Lieberman had to say that day.</p>
        <p>Like college editorialists everywhere, Chairman Lieberman's opinions were grounded in a solemn certitude, unalloyed by ambiguity.</p>
        <p>''We saw our role as serious editorial writers, and that shows up in the editorials,'' said Jethro Koller Lieberman, who was The Daily News's associate managing editor under Joseph Lieberman and is now the associate dean of academic affairs at New York Law School. (The two men are not related.) ''We were peculiarly under the Kennedy spell, all of us,'' he said. ''A lot of us saw our futures working in the White House for the administration.''</p>
        <p>Senator Lieberman, who reviewed copies of dozens of editorials sent to his  national campaign headquarters last week, did not respond to several requests to comment on them.</p>
        <p>Candidate Lieberman has been criticized recently by black leaders who say they believe he is a tepid defender of their interests. But the Gore-Lieberman campaign has pointed out that Student Lieberman wrote more about racial injustice than any other subject.</p>
        <p>He also spoke out for undergraduate women seeking admission to Yale. In a front-page editorial on Oct. 25, 1963, he declared, ''The wonders of the female presence are sorely lacking on the Yale campus.''</p>
        <p>No slight was too small to take on. On May 14, 1963, Mr. Lieberman chided The New Haven Register for ridiculing his published comments condemning New Haven police officers who had roughed up a few students during a melee. ''This type of editorializing in an established newspaper such as the Register is altogether disappointing,'' Mr. Lieberman wrote.</p>
        <p>Sometimes he spiced his arguments with analogies like this: in arguing for a ban on boxing, he compared boxing matches to ''gangland killings.'' And in dismissing those who opposed the use of public money for church-affiliated schools, he argued that government money had long been used to enhance religious institutions -- in the form of traffic lights near church property. ''Does not this traffic light aid the religious school or make it more appealing?'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Lieberman is known for his frequent use of humor on the campaign trail, his undergraduate columns were weighted with gravity.</p>
        <p>''It is imperative,'' Mr. Lieberman wrote, on Jan. 13, 1964, his last month as Daily News chairman, ''that a major public and private campaign to discourage cigarette smoking should begin.''</p>
        <p>Reacting to the surgeon general's report linking cigarettes to cancer, Mr. Lieberman went on to suggest: ''Cigarette packages should indicate prominently the tar and nicotine content. Communications outlets should discipline themselves to diminish cigarette advertising.''</p>
        <p>In 1963, Mississippi was a violent battleground between the police and groups protesting state laws restricting the access of blacks to universities and voting booths. Mr. Lieberman echoed many leading editorialists when he wrote that ''the history of the Negro in America is a blatant contradiction to all that this nation promises.''</p>
        <p>On April 10, 1963, Mr. Lieberman even wrote a sympathetic response to the black-separatist message that Malcolm X had delivered to a local audience two days before. ''His message is not pleasing,'' the editorial said, ''but it is the understandable response to a people in anguish.''</p>
        <p>Six months later, in a bylined column headlined ''Why I Go to Mississippi,'' Mr. Lieberman explained his compulsion to join other Yale students who had traveled to Indianola, Miss., to assist in a mock election of a black man prohibited by state law from running for office.</p>
        <p>''I am going to Mississippi because I feel that my presence, as a white man, can indicate to Negro Mississippians that there are white men who care about their plight, that there are white men whose insides burn with anxiety and guilt when the consider the way in which other white men have sought to rob the black man of his humanity.''</p>
        <p>In the last days of his chairmanship, Mr. Lieberman grew nostalgic. ''Did we succeed in not taking ourselves too seriously?'' he asked in his final editorial, on Jan. 29, 1964.</p>
        <p>''There is obviously a built-in tone of seriousness about writing most editorials,'' he wrote. ''But we do not think we lacked the capacity to take the whole thing with a hell of a grain of salt.''</p>
