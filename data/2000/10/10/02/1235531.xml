        <p>On a fourth consecutive day of violence that occasionally looked more like war than rioting, an Israeli-Palestinian agreement to restrain the fighting disintegrated today. Palestinian funerals fed the rage that propelled fresh protests that were countered at times by heavy-duty Israeli weapons.</p>
        <p>During several exchanges of live ammunition with Palestinians sniping at them from rooftops and inside abandoned buildings, Israeli troops fired antitank rockets, lobbed grenades, shot from combat helicopters and maintained positions nearby in tanks. At the same time, the Voice of Palestine radio broadcast unusual Hebrew-language appeals for Israeli soldiers to restrain themselves, saying, ''Our babies' blood is as red as your babies.' ''</p>
        <p>For the first time, Palestinian rioting itself spread beyond the West Bank and Gaza into Arab towns like Nazareth inside Israel's borders. The internal riots stunned Israeli police officials by their size and intensity. One Israeli Arab was shot and killed.</p>
        <p>Additionally, nine Palestinians were reported dead today, bringing the Arab death toll to 28 since Friday, when Israeli troops stormed the area of Al Aksa Mosque in the contested center of Jerusalem's Old City after Palestinians began stoning Jewish worshipers at the Western Wall.</p>
        <p>That action followed angry scenes on Thursday set off by the visit of the right-wing political leader Ariel Sharon to the steps of the ancient mosques in the Old City.</p>
        <p>The riots claimed their first Israeli victim today, a border policeman  fatally wounded during a gun battle that began when Palestinians surrounded Joseph's Tomb, a holy Jewish site, in Palestinian-controlled Nablus.</p>
        <p>With the deadlocked peace negotiations as their backdrop, the Israelis blamed the Palestinians for failing to control their streets while the Palestinians, using terms like murder and massacre, accused the Israelis of excessive force.</p>
        <p>A senior Israeli official said the Israelis believed that the Palestinians wanted to exact vengeance -- ''a few Israeli soldiers dead to make it even'' -- before they cracked down on protesters.</p>
        <p>In uncharacteristically harsh language, Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami, a dove, accused the Palestinians of orchestrating the clashes ''from above, in the hopes that a certain degree of violence would serve a short-term political purpose.'' But he said that unleashing violence deliberately is like ''trying to ride a tiger.''</p>
        <p>Yitzhak Herzog, the Israeli cabinet secretary, said the violence would be counterproductive. ''As someone working closely with Prime Minister Barak,'' he said, ''I know that he will insist that violence not be used as a negotiating tool. In fact, this will only make Barak's positions tougher and stronger.''</p>
        <p>With black smoke billowing from burning tires and trash cans, funeral processions snaked through the rocky hills of the West Bank and along the sands of the Gaza Strip. Marching grimly to mourning verses from the Koran, Palestinian soldiers carried aloft the bodies of young men draped in Palestinian flags as fresh bodies collected in the morgues.</p>
        <p>It was a vicious -- but familiar -- cycle in which the sorrow roused by burials turned into the anger that fueled new rounds of violent confrontation between Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers.</p>
        <p>Palestinian mourners proceeded directly from village graveyards to the junctions between Israeli and Palestinian-ruled areas, where they jumped from pickup trucks adorned with wreathed pictures of the dead to collect and hurl stones at Israeli soldiers dressed in riot gear.</p>
        <p>''Our people are ready to have 10 times the numbers of martyrs,'' said Rafik Natsheh, the Palestinian labor minister. ''We gave too much to the peace process. We gave it to too much of a chance.''</p>
        <p>It is widely believed here that the present violence was touched off by Mr. Sharon's visit on Thursday. The Israelis have not formally acknowledged that. Today, though, a senior Israeli official said, ''It's clear to everyone that it's the Sharon show that created the original damage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon himself has said that he regrets the deaths but stands by his original assertion that any Israeli has the right to visit the Muslim religious compound on Haram al Sharif, where the Dome of the Rock has stood since the seventh century. Jews call the site the Temple Mount. On Israeli television, he said any Arab could visit Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, without permission. Yad Vashem is not a religious site.</p>
        <p>But Haram al Sharif is the subject of a bitter dispute that has deadlocked the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. And Mr. Sharon, surrounded by Israeli troops, strode into a very fragile situation, cheered on by nationalist Israelis. He says the situation escalated out of control because of inflammatory language used by Israeli-Arab lawmakers who were present during his visit.</p>
        <p>In Palestinian eyes -- and those of many Israeli leftists -- the present violent conflict is framed by ''a devil and an angel,'' said Muhammad Abu Hatem, a Gazan laborer and one of many who used the same words. As these people see it, the ''devil'' is Mr. Sharon and the angel is 12-year-old Muhammad al-Durrah, who was killed in the crossfire in Gaza while his father tried to shield him.</p>
        <p>Cameramen for French television captured Muhammad's death on tape, and it was broadcast throughout the region. The tape showed the boy and his father cowering beside a cement block as Israeli and Palestinians forces exchanged gunfire, and the camera was trained on them when a bullet hit the boy and he crumpled and died.</p>
        <p>In one night, it became the image that summed up the horror that many Israelis and Palestinians felt as they came to grips with the violence. For many Israelis, who today celebrated the second day of the Jewish New Year, the news has penetrated very slowly into the cocoon created by a national and religious holiday when no newspapers are published.</p>
        <p>Roni Daniel, a veteran Israeli television journalist, saw the footage for the first time as he was delivering the news on Saturday night. ''I lost my voice,'' he said today as shots rang out to punctuate his words. ''I've been doing this for many years, and I'm not exactly a vegetarian. But my brain went dead, and my tongue went limp. To see a little boy killed before your eyes . . .''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon has long symbolized the ugly Israeli to the Arab world. A former top-ranking general and defense minister, he is reviled for his lead role in the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and for failing to prevent the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. He is also seen as an architect of the Israeli settlement policy.</p>
        <p>''Death to Sharon!'' protesters have shouted throughout Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. At Haram al Sharif on Friday, an effigy of him was burned.</p>
        <p>Today, The Jordan Times ran an editorial called ''Deadly Provocations,'' laying the blame for the conflicts ''squarely on the fleshy shoulders of one man: Ariel Sharon.''</p>
        <p>But Israeli officials said that the situation has moved well beyond the original provocation to take on a life of its own.</p>
        <p>Some Palestinians agreed. Yair Darwish, 31, a Palestinian professional attending a funeral here today, said Palestinians were so frustrated with the failing peace negotiations that they were primed to explode at the provocation. ''Sharon was the match,'' Mr. Darwish said. ''But there was already gasoline poured all over the situation.''</p>
        <p>This morning, outside the morgue at the Ramallah Hospital, mourners carried posters of the youth inside, Nizar Mahmou Eideh, who was 16 and had brown saucer eyes and the hint of a mustache. ''Mention the name of God,'' one man called out, crying, as Mr. Eideh's father entered to view his son and escort him back to their village for burial.</p>
        <p>With a look of disbelief, the father leaned over the coffin and studied his boy, whose face was contorted as if in agony. Ibrahim Eideh, the youth's uncle, said they had always expected him to end up wrapped in a Palestinian flag. ''This is his third time injured in a demonstration, and his last,'' the uncle said. ''All the time, he was saying, 'I want to be a martyr, I want to be a martyr.' He believed it was his destiny.''</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said the Palestinians should be tempering rather than encouraging these feelings.</p>
        <p>Senior Israeli and Palestinian security officials met this morning and agreed to restrain the fighting. Israelis said that lower-level field contacts that were supposed to have taken place did not, and that some initial restraint by Palestinian troops in the morning petered out by the afternoon and evening.</p>
        <p>At the Netzarim junction in Gaza this morning, Palestinian policemen visibly made an effort to prevent youths who were gathering stones from advancing on the Israeli army post and Jewish settlement. But there were hundreds of protesters who simply ignored them or wriggled from their grasp. At a certain point, the Palestinian officers did stand back.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Israeli soldiers there started the day with obvious orders to use their fire sparingly, Palestinian witnesses said. They fired warning shots and used rubber bullets sporadically rather than continuously. But by the afternoon, the forces on both sides were exchanging heavy fire, and the Israelis were using rockets. Several teenagers were treated for shrapnel wounds that dotted their bodies.</p>
