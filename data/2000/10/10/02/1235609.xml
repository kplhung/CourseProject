        <p>SILLS-Thomas A. On September 26 at age 86. Beloved husband of the late Jeanne Reynal, a mosaicist. Devoted father of Kenneth and Michael, grandfather of Arvis and Dawn and brother of Anne McMurray. A gifted artist, who was a member of the New York Abstract Expressionist movement and then later in life turned to collage as a medium to create surreal works of unusual power and beauty. Lawrence Campbell wrote in Art News, ''There is a novel and unique strangeness to his work. He flirts with a language which has taken thousands of years to evolve.'' Memorial services Monday evening, 6 PM, at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 Street.</p>
