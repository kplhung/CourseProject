        <p>Rick A. Lazio declared yesterday that he supported the F.D.A.'s approval of the abortion-inducing drug RU-486, breaking from the position taken by his party's presidential nominee, George W. Bush. But the Republican candidate for Senate in New York said he opposed allowing the government to pay for the drug for poor women.</p>
        <p>''I disagree with him on this,'' Mr. Lazio said of Mr. Bush in explaining his support for the ruling by the Food and Drug Administration allowing the marketing of RU-486, or mifepristone. ''I think the F.D.A. signed off on safety. It ought to be available. And it's, again, another way a women can make a choice.''</p>

        <p>Rick A. Lazio declared yesterday that he supported the F.D.A.'s approval of the abortion-inducing drug RU-486, breaking from the position taken by his party's presidential nominee, George W. Bush. But the Republican candidate for Senate in New York said he opposed allowing the government to pay for the drug for poor women.</p>
        <p>''I disagree with him on this,'' Mr. Lazio said of Mr. Bush in explaining his support for the ruling by the Food and Drug Administration allowing the marketing of RU-486, or mifepristone. ''I think the F.D.A. signed off on safety. It ought to be available. And it's, again, another way a women can make a choice.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lazio took a step away from his electoral base, Hillary Rodham Clinton took a step toward hers yesterday, campaigning at black churches in Harlem, urging parishioners to ''put a red circle'' around Election Day on their calendars, a plea that signaled the importance she is attaching to a high turnout among black voters.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton invoked the pioneers of the nation's civil rights struggles as she urged parishioners to be sure to vote on Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>Her entreaties were the kind that politicians usually save for the final days of a campaign, and reflected concern among some Democrats that she can no longer count on the automatic strong turnout among black voters that seemed likely when her opponent was Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who quit the race in May.</p>
        <p>''If we don't vote, we turn our backs on everybody from Harriet Tubman to Frederick Douglass to Dr. Martin Luther King,'' Mrs. Clinton said at St. Luke African Methodist Episcopal Church on Amsterdam Avenue and 153rd Street, the third stop during the tour, where she half-danced her way down the aisle and out the church to the swelling chorus of a gospel choir. ''We basically are saying, 'We don't want to be citizens after all, do we?' We don't want to do the most basic job of citizenship, which is to cast our vote.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's position on RU-486, that he supports its distribution but does not believe Medicaid should pay for it, was evidence of the conflicting pressures he faces as he tries to present himself as a moderate Republican without alienating conservatives who have been extremely important to his financial and electoral support. He describes himself as ''pro-choice,'' but abortion advocacy groups have opposed his candidacy because he supports several restrictions on the practice, this one being the latest.</p>
        <p>''I would not say that for abortion purposes that RU-486 ought to be picked up as a Medicaid expense from the federal government,'' Mr. Lazio said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. ''If the state wants to deal with it, if the private sector wants to pick up the cost, if people want to make sure that they generate dollars to help low-income women pay for that, that's fine. I just don't think taxpayers should do it.''</p>
        <p>The remarks by the two candidates came on a warm October day that found Mr. Lazio traveling to Washington in the morning for a television interview and back to New York, where he slid between two ethnic cultures celebrating near each other: the Pulaski Day Parade, which started at Fifth Avenue and 26th Street, and the Korean Day Festival, on 32nd Street west of Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>At the parade, Mr. Lazio marched 27 blocks with Mayor Giuliani at his side. (Mr. Giuliani, characteristically, kept marching up Fifth Avenue when Mr. Lazio turned off at 53rd Street.)</p>
        <p>Reflecting the changing ethnic composition of the city, patches of the sidewalk were vacant along parts of the parade route, but Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lazio seemed unperturbed.</p>
        <p>On both sides of Fifth Avenue, small groups of people holding ''Lazio for Senate'' signs planted themselves where Mr. Lazio walked by, and once he passed, raced a block ahead to wait for him again. The effect was something like the rolling, repeating backdrop in cartoons produced before computerized animation.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Lazio, it ensured that there was always at least one supportive sign in the background for the television cameras to capture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has made a point of appearing on the national talk shows in Washington, something that Mrs. Clinton has avoided. (''I'm going to keep talking to the voters of New York and the press of New York and keep traveling around the state,'' she said when asked yesterday. ''That is where I am going to be spending my time.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's advisers view the appearances as a way of generating campaign contributions from supporters across the nation, and have asserted that Mrs. Clinton's refusal to appear reflects timidity on her part.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's appearance with Tim Russert, the host of the first debate between the candidates, was a good deal longer and more detailed than many of his interviews with reporters who regularly cover his campaign: his news conference in New York yesterday, for example, lasted three minutes.</p>
        <p>Besides detailing his position on RU-486, Mr. Lazio said he had no regrets about the aggressive posture he struck toward Mrs. Clinton during their debate. Several polls have suggested that Mr. Lazio hurt himself with that debate, when he walked across the stage and urged Mrs. Clinton to sign a paper renouncing the use of soft money.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans have suggested that Mr. Lazio find some way to offer amends for his actions in preparation for the next debate, which is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Sunday on WCBS-TV.</p>
        <p>At a lunch with reporters upstate last week, Mr. Lazio seemed to acknowledge that the first debate had not gone as well as his advisers had originally claimed. ''Actually, it turned out some of those questions were probably not good for me,'' he said with a small smile and without elaborating.</p>
        <p>But that was not his reaction yesterday on ''Meet the Press.'' When Mr. Russert asked him, ''You don't think you were menacing or impolite?'' Mr. Lazio answered, ''I don't think so at all.''</p>
        <p>At another point, Mr. Lazio sought to explain what a number of Republicans said was an error he made at the debate, when he proclaimed that the upstate economy had turned a corner.</p>
        <p>''Upstate New Yorkers would be the first to say that we have turned the corner on the failed policies of the Cuomo administration,'' Mr. Lazio said. And then, apparently recalling that Mr. Russert was Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's communications director before he got into the news business,  Mr. Lazio hastened to add: ''No insult to you.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton supports the F.D.A. decision on RU-486 and Medicaid financing for it as well, a spokesman said last night.</p>
        <p>Kelli Conlin, the president of the New York chapter of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, and an opponent of Mr. Lazio, criticized his remarks: ''Once again, he's trying to restrict the number of women who can have access to a legal method of abortion.''</p>
        <p>The chairman of the state Conservative Party, Michael Long, who is a strong supporter of Mr. Lazio and an opponent of abortion, said he was not happy with Mr. Lazio's position, but not surprised by it. ''We knew going into this race that Lazio was pro-choice,'' Mr. Long said. ''I wish he weren't, but I knew he was.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton toured the churches with an escort of some of the city's most prominent black politicians, among them Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Harlem Democrat; Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr.; and Bill Perkins, the city councilman. David N. Dinkins, the former mayor, joined her at the last church.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, was not on hand yesterday, and Mrs. Clinton's advisers said that she had no immediate plans to campaign with a figure that the first lady has for the most part avoided this year.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has seemed particularly energized when campaigning in black churches and in union halls, two of the last places where politicians can be assured of finding a passionate and energetic crowd. And yesterday was no exception. Besides visiting the churches, Mrs. Clinton made an unscheduled stop at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, to tour exhibitions on slavery and the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
        <p>She contended that sending Democrats to Congress was the only way to ensure the continuation of economic strides that she said blacks had made under President Clinton. ''I will keep going until everyone has access to a good job and every child has access to a quality education and a modern school building with a qualified teacher, until everyone has access to quality and affordable health care,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>At St. Philip's Church on West 134th Street, she spoke about the growing importance of prayer in her life -- particularly, she said to knowing laughter from the crowd, during her years in Washington.</p>
        <p>''Somebody asked me the other day whether I prayed,'' Mrs. Clinton told the congregation. ''And I said, yes, I do pray, and I have to tell you that if I didn't pray before the White House, I would have started. It is those prayers and that faith that certainly'' -- she stopped for a dramatic pause -- ''kept me going.''</p>
        <p>Churchgoers expressed delight at having a first lady in their midst.</p>
        <p>''She was right on the money,'' said Dorothy Day, who heard Mrs. Clinton speak at St. Philip's Church. ''She speaks what we are feeling in our community.''</p>
