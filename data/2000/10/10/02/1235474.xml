        <p>Leigh Witchel choreographically brooded on the transience of youth in ''A Shropshire Lad,'' the solo Peter Boal performed on Friday night at the Pace Downtown Theater on a program by Dance as Ever, Mr. Witchel's chamber-ballet troupe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boal, a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, was a guest artist in this piece to a recording of songs by George Butterworth based on poems by A. E. Houseman. Mr. Witchel's deliberately understated choreography was sometimes almost unduly spare. Nevertheless the solo emphasized Mr. Boal's quiet intensity and his ability to hold attention with even a simple walk.  Three other new works were seen at a disadvantage because one of the company's dancers was unable to appear, and Mr. Witchel was forced to recast and rechoreograph his ballets.</p>

        <p>Leigh Witchel choreographically brooded on the transience of youth in ''A Shropshire Lad,'' the solo Peter Boal performed on Friday night at the Pace Downtown Theater on a program by Dance as Ever, Mr. Witchel's chamber-ballet troupe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boal, a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, was a guest artist in this piece to a recording of songs by George Butterworth based on poems by A. E. Houseman. Mr. Witchel's deliberately understated choreography was sometimes almost unduly spare. Nevertheless the solo emphasized Mr. Boal's quiet intensity and his ability to hold attention with even a simple walk.  Three other new works were seen at a disadvantage because one of the company's dancers was unable to appear, and Mr. Witchel was forced to recast and rechoreograph his ballets.</p>
        <p>''Summer Dance,'' created for three women, was performed by only two. Mary Carpenter and Elizabeth Marie Gumz moved languidly, often doing the same steps, to music by Samuel Barber. Their actions occasionally became monotonous, and one wondered if the originally scheduled third dancer could have added welcome touches of asymmetry to the choreographic patterns.</p>
        <p>''Quodlibet,'' to scores by Mozart and C. E. F. Weyse, was a collection of pretty poses for Sarah LaPorte Folger, Morgan Friedman, Ms. Carpenter, Ms. Gumz and Robert McFarland.  The same cast, with Amy Rodgers replacing Ms. Friedman, appeared in ''The Elevator,'' a spoof of dance styles to a taped collage by Peter C. Lopez. The funniest sketches in this suite, with a set design by Matthew Mohr, took place in and around an elevator.</p>
        <p>People who were jammed together into an elevator suddenly felt inspired to try to lift their arms in the spacious gesture that begins George Balanchine's ''Serenade.'' Later, an elevator door opened and, one by one, out came the ghosts from the Kingdom of the Shades scene in that classic 19th-century fantasy ''La Baydere.'' Other sequences were also amusing, but because they had nothing directly to do with elevators they seemed irrelevant. It was the elevator jokes that gave this ballet its comic lift.</p>
