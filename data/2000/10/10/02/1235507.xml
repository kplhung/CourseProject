        <p>To make the case that a politician who supports more federal programs cannot also support more power for the middle class, Gov. George W. Bush said two weeks ago that voters did not simply have to take his word for it.</p>
        <p>They could listen to Ronald Reagan, who once said, ''You can't be for big government, big bureaucracy, and still be for the little guy.''</p>

        <p>To make the case that a politician who supports more federal programs cannot also support more power for the middle class, Gov. George W. Bush said two weeks ago that voters did not simply have to take his word for it.</p>
        <p>They could listen to Ronald Reagan, who once said, ''You can't be for big government, big bureaucracy, and still be for the little guy.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, giving a speech on energy, Mr. Bush quoted Mr. Reagan at even greater length, asserting that the same questions Mr. Reagan had raised about President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential race applied this time around to Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>These tributes to the only Republican president since 1960 to serve for two full terms did not seem coincidental.</p>
        <p>Between those references, Mr. Bush summoned the memory of President Reagan, either directly or indirectly, at least four other times.</p>
        <p>On Saturday he did it again, telling the audience at the annual conference of the Christian Coalition, ''Like Ronald Reagan, I believe that the freedom we cherish ultimately depends on the values our families teach.''</p>
        <p>More than ever before, Mr. Bush is tightly embracing Mr. Reagan and practically smothering him with affection and reverence.</p>
        <p>The timing is interesting. The coming series of debates, like the election itself, pits Mr. Bush, who has long assumed that he has a personality advantage, against Mr. Gore, who taps a seemingly greater command of policy details. Can anyone say Reagan-Carter in 1980, or Reagan-Mondale in 1984?</p>
        <p>Republican officials with ties to the Bush campaign can, noting that one of Mr. Bush's best hopes in the debates is to trump his opponent with charm, conviction and an aura of authentic and affable leadership, much as Mr. Reagan did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, too, seems conscious of the parallels. In Orlando, Fla., a week ago, he derided what he said was the latest in a series of exaggerations and distortions by Mr. Gore with the phrase ''There he went again.'' It pointedly echoed a famous line Mr. Reagan used in a debate against Mr. Carter.</p>
        <p>In an interview with MSNBC around the same time, Mr. Bush responded to a question about why some people label him a lightweight by saying, ''I take great comfort in the fact that they said the same thing about President Ronald Reagan.''</p>
        <p>And later, on CNN, Mr. Bush said: ''I remember what they did to Ronald Reagan. They belittled him and said, 'Oh, he can't possibly be smart enough to be president of the United States. He is simply an actor.' The man turned out to be a great president.''</p>
        <p>Several of Mr. Bush's aides said there was no intricately plotted, overarching strategy at work.</p>
        <p>They said Mr. Bush had quoted Mr. Reagan in the speech two weeks ago because he was addressing a Republican gathering in California, where Mr. Reagan had been governor.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush quoted Mr. Reagan in the energy speech on Friday, they said, because Mr. Bush's argument against Mr. Gore was so much like the one Mr. Reagan had made against President Carter, who emphasized conserving energy over expanding the supply.</p>
        <p>''We did, to some extent, want to raise, for the people who remembered it, the specter of what was going on in the late 1970's,'' the adviser said, referring to the energy shortages and long gas lines that helped undo Mr. Carter. Mr. Bush has used rising fuel costs to imply that the Clinton administration is bringing the country to the brink of similar woes.</p>
        <p>But several of Mr. Bush's advisers and other Republican strategists noted that there were additional reasons for him to refer to Mr. Reagan.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush is trying to persuade an electorate that does not necessarily prefer his positions and policies that he would be a better, more optimistic, more inspiring leader. Mr. Reagan talked about ''morning in America''; Mr. Bush occasionally quotes a Texas artist who talked about living on ''the sunrise side'' of the mountain.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush is selling a sweeping tax cut as economically healthy, and after President Reagan signed such legislation, the economy did improve. Mr. Bush has repeatedly credited that development as the wellspring of today's prosperity, neglecting to mention that federal debt ballooned.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is customary for a candidate who wants to be his party's leader in the future to talk about the party's leaders from the past, and Mr. Bush's choices from the last few decades are limited.</p>
        <p>Neither President Nixon nor President Ford will do. As for the Republican president who succeeded Mr. Reagan, well, that strikes a little too close to home, fueling potentially unhelpful chatter about dynasties and filial advantages.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, he doesn't want to talk about his own dad, because it's too self-serving,'' said John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster. ''And it's already there, implied, all the time -- it's the brand name.''</p>
