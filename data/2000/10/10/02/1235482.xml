        <p>Under pressure from politicians and federal regulators, Hollywood executives, one by one in the last few weeks, promised to cut back on the flashy commercials that make children want to go down to the nearest megaplex and put down their lunch money to see the latest R-rated, blood-and-guts thriller.</p>
        <p>But after weeks of hullabaloo after a Federal Trade Commission report accusing Hollywood of inappropriately marketing adult entertainment to children, it is unclear whether things will change with regard to the nation's most powerful promotional tool: television.</p>
        <p>Last week the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie industry's trade group, announced that it would take matters into its own hands and pledged its members would set a ''goal of not inappropriately specifically targeting children'' while promoting R-rated films.</p>
        <p>But, in light of the report's finding that studio executives had used programs popular with children to promote R-rated movies, only three of the studios detailed specific plans to cease such practices. And how much of a change these plans actually represent is open to interpretation.</p>
        <p>Only two of the six major broadcast networks, ABC and Fox -- both owned by media companies with movie studios -- announced plans to help block this kind of marketing.</p>
        <p>And it seems that the new standards that ABC and Fox announced would probably not have much effect on the number of advertisements for R-rated films that they show to begin with.</p>
        <p>Whether that means there is no real problem with movie advertisements inappropriately aiming at youngsters on television in the first place, or that the networks are just offering empty proposals -- or not at all -- with the hope that the issue will go away after the political season ends, is a matter for debate.</p>
        <p>''As usual, these companies try to get by with doing as little as they can in the heat of the pressure and hope the pressure goes away,'' said Kathryn C. Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education, a Washington group that monitors how the media influences children.</p>
        <p>Several network executives privately argued that the situation is under control, at least from their end, and that there is no epidemic of inappropriate movie advertising on prime-time television to begin with, though most acknowledged there had been some.</p>
        <p>Finding ways to cease all of it is proving complicated. Partly at issue is when to consider a television audience young.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, many in the industry have defined a young audience as one in which 35 percent of the people in it are 17 or younger.</p>
        <p>So, in making what may have seemed at the time a bold pronouncement, The Fox Network, a unit of the News Corporation, said last week that, among other things, it would no longer show advertisements for R-rated movies during any programs for which at least 35 percent of the audience is under 17 years old. Executives also said that 20th Century Fox Film, also a unit of News Corporation, would not advertise its own R-rated movies on any program, on any network, with such an audience. The Warner Brothers movie studio made the same pledge.</p>
        <p>But the Fox network, which already blocks ads for R-rated movies from many shows it deems family-friendly, like ''Futurama'' -- does not have any programs that would fit that 35 percent criteria. In fact, in all of broadcast television, there are only a few prime-time programs that do. ''W.W.F. Smackdown,'' which runs on UPN is one. Another, ''Popular,'' is shown on the WB Network. NBC and CBS have none. Last year ABC had three, but none of those will be returning this season.</p>
        <p>The Warner Brothers movie studio said it believed its new 35 percent policy would probably most affect the number of advertisements it shows on MTV, Viacom's cable music channel.</p>
        <p>Eric London, a spokesman for the F.T.C., said the commission, in its report, did not analyze television audiences by solely using percentages because percentages were not always adequate.</p>
        <p>''There might be shows where the percentage of children watching is lower, but, in fact, it might be the most popular show among children,'' Mr. London said.</p>
        <p>For instance, only 13 percent of the audience for ABC's ''Dharma &amp; Greg'' included people aged 2 through 17 last television season. Still, that represented nearly 2 million viewers. But, while 42 percent of the audience for ''Popular'' fell into that age range, that represented only 1.2 million viewers.</p>
        <p>It was with that in mind that ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, said it would not show any advertisements for R-rated films between 8 and 9 p.m., which is widely considered the prime hour for family viewing.</p>
        <p>But the announcement did not represent any great change. ABC has always had a loose policy barring R-rated ads between 8 and 9 p.m., although some exceptions were made, ABC executives said.</p>
        <p>And generally, they said, advertisements for R-rated movies have represented about 0.07 percent of the ads the network shows between 8 and 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>Disney's proposal has been well received in some quarters of Washington. Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, has requested that all the networks follow Disney's lead.</p>
        <p>But for their part, the other networks said that was not necessary. Executives with CBS, NBC, UPN and the WB said they had proper screening mechanisms to keep inappropriate advertisements from being shown to children and that they did not believe they needed to do more.</p>
        <p>''We have standards and practices to make sure that what is on the air in terms of advertising and programming is appropriate for our viewers,'' said Gil Schwartz, CBS executive vice president of communications. ''We'll continue, as we have for many decades, to rely on their professionalism and their judgment.''</p>
        <p>They may have a point. Missing from the debate have been many actual, hard numbers and no general accounting of how many advertisements of R-rated films have run on television, in prime time, on programs watched by large numbers of youngsters.</p>
        <p>But some on Capitol Hill said it would be unwise to assume that the issue will go away when the election season ends.</p>
        <p>''We're going to be watching now,'' warned Erik Hotmire, news secretary for Senator Brownback. Asked what would happen if nothing changed, however, Mr. Hotmire, offered no specific recourse.</p>
