        <p>Vice President Al Gore often resists calls to be succinct. Here is an example from a debate with former Senator Bill Bradley in Durham, N.H., on Jan. 5, 2000. The moderator, Peter Jennings, asked for one-word answers.</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. Gore, has Mr. Bradley ever taken a vote or a quote of yours out of context?  GORE -- I haven't complained about any.  Q. Question was, has he?  A. I'd have to think. I haven't made a point of responding to that. I don't -- I won't accuse him of that.  Q. Interesting one-word answer, sir.  A. Well, I don't know that the answer is no, but if you want a no, I'll give you a no.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore often resists calls to be succinct. Here is an example from a debate with former Senator Bill Bradley in Durham, N.H., on Jan. 5, 2000. The moderator, Peter Jennings, asked for one-word answers.</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. Gore, has Mr. Bradley ever taken a vote or a quote of yours out of context?  GORE -- I haven't complained about any.  Q. Question was, has he?  A. I'd have to think. I haven't made a point of responding to that. I don't -- I won't accuse him of that.  Q. Interesting one-word answer, sir.  A. Well, I don't know that the answer is no, but if you want a no, I'll give you a no.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore likes interjections with an edge. Here he was in a Dec. 1, 1987, debate in Washington with ve other Democrats, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Gore was running as the Southern candidate.</p>
        <p>JACKSON -- Since I'm the Southern candidate --  GORE -- South Chicago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore can be especially persistent, as in this excerpt from a debate with ve other Democrats, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt, on Feb. 29, 1988, in Williamsburg, Va.</p>
        <p>GORE TO GEPHARDT -- Do you think the Reagan-Gephardt Tax Bill of '81 was fair? Yes? No?  GEPHARDT -- You nished, Al? You nished?  GORE -- Yes or no? Yes or no? Was it fair?  GEPHARDT -- Are you nished? Are you nished?  GORE -- Are you going to answer?  GEPHARDT -- Are you nished?  GORE -- If you'll answer.  GEPHARDT -- I thought they taught you manners at St. Albans.  GORE -- Yes or no, Dick?  GEPHARDT -- Al, it was fair to take two-thirds of the money from that tax bill and give it to families earning $50,000 or less.  GORE -- You still haven't answered the question.  GEPHARDT -- By our party, by our party --  GORE -- Was that bill fair?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also thoroughly researches his opponent's positions and can be quick to unspool those positions. In his Oct. 9, 1996, vice-presidential debate with Jack F. Kemp in St. Petersburg, Fla., he did this after Mr. Kemp said that ownership of one's own home was afrmative action of the sort that Abraham Lincoln would have favored.</p>
        <p>GORE -- With all due respect, I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Dole's position to end all afrmative action. There is a specic measure on the ballot in California. It was embodied in legislation, introduced by Senator Dole, to apply to the whole nation. Mr. Kemp campaigned against it, spoke against it, wrote letters against it, went to California to ght against it, and now has endorsed it. I don't think it's a minor matter. I think this is one of the most important challenges that our country has to face in the future, and I hope that Mr. Kemp will try to persuade Senator Dole to adopt Mr. Kemp's position, instead of the other way around.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is also a master of the planned put-down, as he demonstrated in his Nov. 9, 1993, debate with Ross Perot on CNN's Larry King Live.</p>
        <p>GORE -- He started off as head of United We Stand. I'm afraid he's going to end up as head of Divided We Fall.</p>
