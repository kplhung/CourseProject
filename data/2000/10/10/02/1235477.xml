        <p>At the 1972 Munich Olympics, Dan Gable won a gold medal in freestyle wrestling, and at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, he coached the United States team to six golds.</p>
        <p>But this year the freestyle team he coached with John Smith, Greg Strobel and Bruce Burnett will leave here with no golds -- just the two silvers and two bronzes that made their recipients so unhappy.</p>
        <p>The freestyle team won three golds in 1996, three in 1992 and two in 1988. Except for the 1980 Moscow Games, which the United States boycotted, the last time the American freestyle team failed to win gold was in Mexico City 32 years ago.</p>
        <p>''We lost a lot of close ones when it really counted, so you can't say we were successful,'' Gable said today after the competition ended. ''You can lose it as quickly as you can win it. You have to remember how tough it is to wrestle in the Olympics. We have to figure out the reason; then maybe we can turn this around. We were so close to winning. But it's such a small difference that makes a big difference.''</p>
        <p>Early today, Kerry McCoy, a native of Riverhead, N.Y., lost in the quarterfinals in the 286-pound class. Soon after, Terry Brands (127 3/4) and Lincoln McIlravy (152) lost their semifinal matches and returned with strong victories to win bronzes. But the medals drooped from their necks like the world's worst consolation prizes.</p>
        <p>''Two guys were better than me,'' said Brands, 32, who retired for a while last year after unexplained headaches and blackouts. ''I didn't do this for redemption. I did it for the gold. I've got to get better.'' His twin, Tom, won gold in the same class in Atlanta in 1996.</p>
        <p>McIlravy, a four-time national champion, said: ''Coming back to wrestle for the bronze after losing in the semis was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I won the bronze for my country, my God and my family, but it didn't mean anything to me. The dream of being a gold medalist is forever gone.''</p>
        <p>McIlravy, 26, is unsure if he will try to wrestle at the 2004 Summer Games.</p>
        <p>On a day of disappointment, USA Wrestling protested the scoring in McCoy's quarterfinal and Brands's semifinal matches. Judges reviewed a tape of McCoy's 8-7 loss to Artur Taymazov of Uzbekistan and rescored it 11-9. Both protests were denied.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, Brandon Slay and Sammie Henson won silver medals, but Slay said the referee had unfairly penalized him for 3 points as Alexander Leipold of Germany won the gold. Henson was so distraught that he rushed from the mat, crying, wailing and screaming about his loss in the final to Namig Abdullayev of Azerbaijan.</p>
        <p>''We had the potential,'' Gable said. ''Nobody picked many of our guys for gold. We felt we had several contenders, but no one guy was able to withstand enough of everything to win a gold. We need to get better, because we don't want this again.''</p>
        <p>The high point for the American wrestling team was the gold medal won by Rulon Gardner over Aleksandr Karelin of Russia in the Greco-Roman superheavyweight division. Karelin was considered unbeatable in his quest for a fourth consecutive gold, but Gardner used his bulk and defensive skills to prevent him from mounting an offense.</p>
        <p>With good reason, Gardner was clearly the most gracious of American medalists. Slay refused to let the referee raise his hand after his match, and McIlravy would not wave his floral bouquet to the fans.</p>
        <p>''I know some people don't like us for not shaking hands,'' Gable said. ''But we have freedom in America. Our reactions aren't the same as other people.''</p>
        <p>The American attitude led a German wrestling coach, Wolfgang Nitschke, to say on Saturday, ''The Americans can't lose.''</p>
