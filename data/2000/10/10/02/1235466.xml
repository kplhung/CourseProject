        <p>Ernst &amp; Young to Spin Off Business-Training Company  The accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young plans to spin off its online corporate-training operations this week as part of a strategy to become a dominant player in the crowded online corporate-training industry.</p>
        <p>Ernst &amp; Young hopes that the independent company, Intellinex, will be able to grow more rapidly through acquisitions than it could if it remained a part of the parent firm. There are thought to be about 5,000 players, large and small, in the online business-training industry, with new entrants appearing almost weekly. No single company holds more than 5 percent of the market. [Page C16.]</p>

        <p>Stock and Debt Offerings Rebound  The market for debt and stock offerings rebounded in the third quarter. Investment banks raised $459 billion in the United States over the last three months.
