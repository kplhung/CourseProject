        <p>Proposals for a stadium on the far West Side of Manhattan seem to emerge every year as the solution to a problem, like a way to keep the Yankees in town or to get the Jets back from out of town.</p>
        <p>And if the plans are never officially dropped, they have always faded away amid a chorus of naysayers.</p>
        <p>This year, a proposal to build a 100,000-seat domed sports stadium over the rail yards west of 10th Avenue has become the linchpin of efforts by powerful rival forces  to bring the Olympics to New York City in the summer of 2012.</p>
        <p>Though those forces are united behind the Olympic flag, their varied agendas could tear the effort apart, some critics say.</p>
        <p>''It's a disparate group of very powerful people trying to pursue their pet projects,'' said Elliott D. Sclar, a professor of economics and urban planning at Columbia University. ''And it may very well blow up in their faces.''</p>
        <p>So the tug of war has begun again between those who want to build a stadium in Manhattan as the centerpiece of a wide-ranging development plan, and those who say such a large-scale project would be devastating to the relatively low-scale West Side below 42nd Street, while the stadium itself would be a costly white elephant.</p>
        <p>NYC 2012, the committee leading the effort to play host for the Games, has won the support of Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who face off as rivals as often as they meet as partners; corporations like Merrill Lynch, Time Warner and the Loews hotel corporation; some of the city's largest developers; and virtually every newspaper editorial board in the city.</p>
        <p>The proposed Olympic stadium, as well as an office tower, a hotel and a new home for Madison Square Garden, would be built on a platform over the rail yards, which stretch from 30th to 34th Streets, between 10th and 12th Avenues. It could become a new home for the New York Jets football team and could be used for large conventions as part of a badly needed expansion of the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which sits across 34th Street.</p>
        <p>Daniel L. Doctoroff, the investment banker who heads NYC 2012, said the Olympic effort was an opportunity to do something great for the city, and could result in new parks, housing and an estimated $10 billion in economic activity.</p>
        <p>''The major benefit of hosting the Olympic Games is that it would act as a catalyst for projects in the city that you otherwise wouldn't be able to muster the political will to achieve,'' Mr. Doctoroff said in a telephone interview from Sydney, Australia, where he was attending this year's Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>The New York Olympic committee has been working closely with the Giuliani administration on a plan to rezone the area west of Eighth Avenue, from 42nd to 28th Streets, for more than 20 million square feet of office space. The office projects would take some pressure off the rapidly rising rents in Manhattan and provide space for companies now moving to New Jersey, they said. A proposed extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to the project, as well as links to regional train networks, would carry residents, office workers and sports fans to the area.</p>
        <p>But local community groups say the Olympic effort is a Trojan horse for a sports arena in an already congested neighborhood and a major rezoning that would displace longtime residents and businesses.</p>
        <p>''Mayor Giuliani and the stadium boosters are offering us an enormous megaproject, which would overwhelm us with traffic and make this neighborhood unlivable,'' State Senator Thomas K. Duane said.</p>
        <p>Ross Graham, the chairwoman of the South Hell's Kitchen Planning Committee, said New York needed less costly office space in Brooklyn and Queens to compete with New Jersey more than it needed expensive space in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>She said the community board favored a comprehensive plan for the area that included middle-income housing, the preservation of light industry and some office development.</p>
        <p>NYC 2012 says it is not a subterfuge for a giant development, but one adviser acknowledged that the Olympic effort needed a stadium with up to 100,000 seats for opening ceremonies and track and field events, and that it had few options politically other than building on the West Side.</p>
        <p>''We're not using the Olympics as a stalking horse for a stadium,'' the adviser said. ''But it's clear that the big hole in the viability of New York as an Olympic site is the absence of an Olympic-quality stadium.''</p>
        <p>Much of the construction for the Games, like housing for athletes, can wait until 2005, when the International Olympic Committee will select a host for 2012; but major projects, like the extension of subway lines and a huge new stadium, cannot. (The committee is required to submit its application to the United States Olympic Committee by Dec. 15. New York is one of eight cities in the United States alone seeking to hold the Games.)</p>
        <p>NYC 2012 estimates that the Olympic Games will generate $3.2 billion in revenue and cost $1.9 billion to run, leaving $1.3 billion to build athletic facilities and parks. The Olympic proponents have said the stadium could be built with private money, but they have not said what they would pay the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the land.</p>
        <p>The committee has also explored using tax revenues from the increased value of property on the West Side to pay for an estimated $2.3 billion in projects, including the extension of the No. 7 subway line ($780 million), a retractable stadium roof ($248.9 million) and the platform over the rail yards ($382.8 million).</p>
        <p>But one top executive at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the subway alone would cost $1.5 billion, and state officials and other public finance analysts say taxpayers will have to cover hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in costs.</p>
        <p>In 1993, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo first proposed a West Side stadium for the Yankees after the team's principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3rd, threatened to move the club to New Jersey. The suggestion was condemned by nearly every Manhattan politician and by Yankees fans.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani got the same kind of reception when he later promoted a billion-dollar West Side stadium for the Yankees. In January 1999, he abruptly changed course, saying the West Side would make a good home for Madison Square Garden and the Jets, which unhappily shares Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands with the New York Giants.</p>
        <p>Later, the Olympics promoters seized on the suggestion and tied it into the more far-reaching proposal.</p>
        <p>According to people involved in the effort, the stadium proposal is a compromise put together by NYC 2012 over the last year. Until recently, Governor Pataki's five-year effort to double the size of the Javits center to 1.5 million square feet had been blocked by Mr. Giuliani, who refused to go along unless the governor supported a West Side baseball stadium for the Yankees, something he has refused to do.</p>
        <p>Under the Olympic plans, the mayor would get a stadium, albeit a football field, and the governor would get a bigger convention center.</p>
        <p>Yet the fragile nature of the Olympic coalition was evident last month, when the mayor and the governor  bickered publicly over the future occupants of the stadium.</p>
        <p>It began when Mayor Giuliani said the Olympic stadium could be used by the Jets or the Yankees. The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone,  and other prospective mayoral candidates who had been silent on the Olympic proposal joined the governor in quickly reiterating their opposition to allowing the Yankees to move from their historic home in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''If the idea is to move the Yankees from the Bronx,'' Mr. Pataki said, ''I will oppose it strenuously.''</p>
        <p>He also suggested that an alternative location for the Olympic stadium could be Flushing Meadows-Corona  Park in Queens, where the owners of the Mets have plans to replace Shea Stadium with a $500 million stadium.</p>
        <p>In recent months, people involved in the Olympic effort say, Mr. Steinbrenner has complained to City Hall that any stadium built in Manhattan should be for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>City and state officials and Olympic proponents said they hoped that a stadium for a football team, which plays mostly on Sundays, 10 times a year, would be less politically explosive than trying to move the Yankees.</p>
        <p>NYC 2012 and executives working with the Jets say a Manhattan stadium could be used for concerts, keynote convention speakers, college football and perhaps the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>''I think this could be an opportunity to expand Javits and provide an acceptable stadium for a football team,'' said Charles A. Gargano, the state's top economic development official, who is reviewing the Olympic proposal. ''We just have to work out the economics.''</p>
        <p>But some economists say stadiums rarely work well with convention centers, certainly not enough to justify such a huge expense.</p>
        <p>Jeff Gaines, assistant general manager of the Astrodomain Complex in Houston, said the Astrodome was used for conventions only 30 days a year, mainly by religious groups. That is far fewer than the 90 events projected by NYC 2012 for a West Side stadium.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College in Illinois who has written extensively about stadiums and convention centers, said he was on a commission in Chicago during the 1980's that explored building a stadium for the Chicago Bears and the White Sox next to McCormick Place, one of the largest convention centers in the world. The initiative fell apart, he said, because the teams did not want to share a stadium and the convention hall operators did not think they would use it very often.</p>
        <p>''A stadium is not an optimal space for either trade shows or conventions,'' Professor Baade said. ''If you host a convention of Southern Baptists it works, but there aren't that many Southern Baptist conventions. You're talking about a couple of events a year. It becomes a misinformed rationale for the stadium.''</p>
        <p>Robert Yarrow, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit civic group, said he, too, questioned the wisdom of a West Side stadium. But he said other elements of the Olympic bid, like mass transit and rezoning the West Side, did make sense.</p>
        <p>''It's all driven by the mayor's fixation with a stadium,'' he said. ''Football stadiums are dogs that repel economic activity. The only reason to build a stadium is if it is an excuse to build the transportation infrastructure we need anyway.''</p>
        <p>NYC 2012 recently hired two advisers to navigate the increasingly treacherous political waters that surround its Olympic proposal: Peter J. Powers, a close friend of Mayor Giuliani's and a former deputy mayor, and Kieran Mahoney, a political consultant with close ties to Governor Pataki.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Doctoroff made a misstep at a Sept. 12 news conference with Mayor Giuliani when he neglected to include Mr. Pataki, who controls both the convention center and the rail yards over which Mr. Doctoroff hopes to build the stadium.</p>
        <p>One senior state official complained that the Olympic plans expected vast sums from the state, but little from the city. ''I guess he's going to do this project with the mayor,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doctoroff said he was learning.</p>
        <p>''I'm new to this game,'' he said. ''The state has been and will be our partner in this whole thing. What we're talking about doing here cannot be accomplished without the two of them working together.''</p>
