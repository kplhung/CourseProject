        <p>Bobby Valentine announced before the Mets' final regular-season game yesterday that Mike Hampton would draw the Game 1 pitching assignment when the Mets open the division series in San Francisco on Wednesday. While the Mets stretched out the regular season by playing their longest game of the year, a 13-inning, 3-2 victory over the Montreal Expos, the thoughts were already turning to the postseason.</p>
        <p>''This is the postseason,  so there's a little more pressure involved,'' Hampton said. ''Some guys tend to act a little different with pressure. I don't feel any added pressure. I trust the guys behind me, I trust myself, I trust the things that I can do. I'm comfortable with the way things are now, mentally and physically.''</p>

        <p>Bobby Valentine announced before the Mets' final regular-season game yesterday that Mike Hampton would draw the Game 1 pitching assignment when the Mets open the division series in San Francisco on Wednesday. While the Mets stretched out the regular season by playing their longest game of the year, a 13-inning, 3-2 victory over the Montreal Expos, the thoughts were already turning to the postseason.</p>
        <p>''This is the postseason,  so there's a little more pressure involved,'' Hampton said. ''Some guys tend to act a little different with pressure. I don't feel any added pressure. I trust the guys behind me, I trust myself, I trust the things that I can do. I'm comfortable with the way things are now, mentally and physically.''</p>
        <p>The announcement ended a bit of suspense as to who would start, Hampton (15-10, 3.14 earned run average) or Al Leiter (16-8, 3.20 E.R.A). Both have pitched well lately, and both have pitched well against the Giants. Hampton is 9-0 with a 3.09 E.R.A. in his career against the Giants.</p>
        <p>''It's just the way we started the season,'' Valentine said. ''They're both going to pitch. It's been information overload, which meant nothing. Everything's been talked about, analyzed, and there is no determining factor other than it's Mike Hampton and Al Leiter pitching two very important games on the road as we open the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''You don't get in the playoffs unless your pitchers are good, and you want to have veterans who can handle situations. I think I'll take my chances with my two, and then I back my five against any other five, that's why we're going to battle here.''</p>
        <p>Hampton never started a Game 1 in three years of playoffs with the Houston Astros. ''It's great,'' he said. ''But really, Bobby had no wrong choice. It's just one of those things, Al will get a little extra rest. I can stay on the same schedule.</p>
        <p>''It's an honor to be able to start Game 1, but to me it's really no big deal. To me, it's like a 1A, 1B situation. With Rick Reed and Glendon Rusch, we've got a really solid rotation.</p>
        <p>''This is probably the deepest rotation I've ever been in. Knowing that, hey, you go out there and do the best you can, win or lose, you've got a guy behind you that can pick you up, that's what it's all about.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Mets feel good about starting Hampton, Leiter and Reed (11-5, 4.11 E.R.A.) in the first three games against Livan Hernandez (17-11), Shawn Estes (15-6) and Russ Ortiz (13-12). Hampton gave up five hits and two runs in seven innings to beat the Giants on Aug. 12, and Leiter followed that by limiting them to two hits in eight scoreless innings the next day. Only Reed, who pitched two innings to tune up yesterday, struggled all year against San Francisco, losing both his starts and allowing nine earned runs in 13 1/3 innings.</p>
        <p>Valentine was confident that the decision to start Hampton would not leave any bruised feelings in the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>''I think really if an explanation like that was needed for Al at this time of the year, then there would be some problems getting to where we're getting, as far as what I believe in and what he knows the entire team, the Met organization believes,'' Valentine said. ''I don't think we have that problem. I think Al, I think Mike, I think Rick Reed, Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura, even a couple of guys who got here for one month, understand what we're all about, why we make our decisions and how we do what we do.''</p>
        <p>Leiter said: ''I don't want his explanation because, A: He doesn't have to give it to me, and B: He can tell me whatever he wants. This isn't a time to patronize, either. I understand that.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't really matter. I'm still pitching to the same team, the same lineup, just the next night. I don't see it as that big a deal pitching the first game in a division series. I see this as an unselfish time for a team that is trying to reach it's goal of a world championship, which takes two series before you can get to the ultimate series. It's not the Super Bowl. It's not one game.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BENNY AGBAYANI tested his sore right hamstring and played the entire game, even withstanding an attempt to stretch a single into a double in the seventh inning, sliding hard by the bag without aggravating the muscle. He then scored the winning run in the 13th inning, drawing a leadoff walk, moving to second on a base hit by PAT MAHOMES, and scoring  when JORGE VELANDIA's bunt was thrown away by third baseman GEOFF BLUM trying to get Agbayani at third. ''I had to be a hundred percent sure,'' Agbayani said. ''It feels very good. I just told myself I was going to test it and if was going to pop, it was going to pop.'' . . . Mahomes pitched three scoreless innings to earn the victory, trying to earn his way onto the postseason roster. He escaped a bases-loaded jam in the 11th, striking out two to end the inning. . . . The Mets won their final five games, and eight of their last nine.</p>
