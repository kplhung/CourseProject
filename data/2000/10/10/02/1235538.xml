        <p>Warren Sapp's demeanor was about as pleasant as a beehive that had just been sprayed with water.

        <p>Warren Sapp's demeanor was about as pleasant as a beehive that had just been sprayed with water. Beginning in the second quarter, the Tampa Bay defensive tackle shifted up and down the Washington Redskins' offensive line, giving out equal-opportunity bashings, fighting through double and triple teams and several times body-slamming quarterback Brad Johnson to the ground, sacking him once.</p>
        <p>Sapp's punishment of Washington's offensive line will not lead the evening news. He routinely wreaks havoc on the opposition. But Sapp, the National Football League's defensive player of the year last season and the soul of the Buccaneers, was benched in the first quarter by Coach Tony Dungy for an undisclosed violation of team rules. The questions surrounding Sapp off the field are symbolic of the Buccaneers' disarray. Thanks largely to a subpar offensive performance, the Bucs lost today in overtime to the Redskins, 20-17.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Tampa Bay, a preseason Super Bowl favorite, looks vulnerable at 3-2, and the Redskins, who at one time were playing like a bunch of overpaid frauds, have rebounded from a 1-2 start to lead the N.F.C. East with a 3-2 record.</p>
        <p>Deion Sanders, one of the free agents brought in to help push Washington to the Super Bowl, returned a punt 57 yards in overtime to the Tampa Bay 8-yard line. That spectacular return led to Michael Husted'swinning 20-yard field goal.</p>
        <p>''Maybe people will get off my back now,'' joked Sanders, who has been booed here for his lack of production.</p>
        <p>The Buccaneers' problems -- and their frustrations -- bubbled over before a crowd of 83,532 at FedEx Field. After one particularly futile offensive series early in the second half, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who at that point had 4 catches for just 13 yards, began screaming in the direction of several assistant coaches. Almost simultaneously, running back Warrick Dunn threw his helmet in disgust, and Dunn later had words for quarterback Shaun King, who badly overthrew him on a third-quarter pass that could have produced a touchdown.</p>
        <p>Late in the fourth quarter, the Redskins led by 17-7. The only score the Buccaneers could generate was on a 2-yard run by fullback Mike Alstott, while the Redskins countered with a Stephen Davis touchdown run of 50 yards, a 28-yard field goal by Husted and an 8-yard pass from Brad Johnson to running back Larry Centers.</p>
        <p>King looks like a quarterback who lacks confidence, and the offensive coaches call plays as if they don't trust him. Most of his passes are safe short routes, but the few times King did throw deep, he often missed his target badly. Tampa Bay could also use its best offensive weapon, Keyshawn Johnson, a lot more.</p>
        <p>''Obviously we're not getting it done, that's the problem,'' Johnson said about the Bucs' difficulties in throwing deep. ''Maybe we're not good enough to do it.''</p>
        <p>Johnson, Dunn and Alstott -- Tampa Bay's main offensive weapons -- combined for just 139 total yards. Tampa Bay's offense converted only 3 of 14 third downs and managed just 2.6 yards per rush.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay's normally awesome defense was not blameless. Davis (141 yards on 28 carries) broke at least a half-dozen tackles. For the first time this season, the Buccaneers gave up third-quarter points, and Davis's touchdown run was the longest against the team in 10 years.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect for the Bucs was Sapp. They can only wonder how many more plays he might have made in the first quarter -- and whether one might have made the difference.</p>
        <p>While playing just three quarters, Sapp had one sack, five quarterback pressures, three tackles and one blocked field goal. Neither Dungy nor Sapp would discuss why Sapp was benched for the first quarter. But teams don't sit their best player for a minor infraction.</p>
        <p>Several Buccaneers players, when asked about Sapp, offered only cryptic responses that he had violated team curfew rules. For his part, when he was asked what happened, Sapp said, ''Next question.''</p>
        <p>Despite everything that went wrong for the Buccaneers, they still almost won. With about two minutes left in the game, King connected with wide receiver Reidel Anthony for a 46-yard touchdown. That cut the Redskins' lead to 17-14. Tampa Bay's onside kick was recovered by Redskins wide receiver Irving Fryar, but Washington's subsequent field-goal attempt was blocked by Sapp.</p>
        <p>The Buccaneers were able to send the game into overtime in part because of a 19-yard reception by Johnson that put Tampa Bay on the Washington 29. Martin Gramatica kicked a 42-yard field goal to tie the score as time ran out in regulation.</p>
        <p>That was before the punt return in overtime by Sanders that set up the winning field goal. The Redskins were back, and the Buccaneers had lots of questions to answer.</p>
