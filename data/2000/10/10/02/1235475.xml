        <p>The United States boxing team began the 2000 Olympic tournament with nine consecutive first-round victories, a high-flying time for the Americans whose medal expectations soared.</p>
        <p>It was hard to remember those times today, when the American boxers ended their competition without a gold medal and left Sydney protesting a loss amid accusations that other countries had colluded to foil them.</p>
        <p>It was the first time since 1948 that an American team that competed in the Olympics did not win a division.</p>
        <p>''I think it's slanted toward the European countries,'' United States Coach Tom Mustin said. ''Unfortunately, we weren't able to do our best. I guess I'll go down in the history books, but the wrong way.''</p>
        <p>To the Americans, the controversial defeat was by the featherweight Ricardo Juarez, a reigning world champion, who lost his gold medal bout today to Bekzat Sattar khanov of Kazakhstan on points, 22-14.</p>
        <p>The light-welterweight Ricardo Williams Jr. also lost a decision in his final fight later in the day against Mahamadkadyz Abdullaev of Uzbekistan. Williams lost on points, 27-20.</p>
        <p>Immediately after Juarez's loss, Gary Toney, the American team leader, said that he was lodging a protest of the defeat and that he was going ask that the referee of the bout, Stanislav Kirsanov of Russia, be suspended.</p>
        <p>After meeting on the protest this afternoon, the executive board of the Amateur International Boxing Association let the decision stand but suspended Kirsanov for four years.</p>
        <p>Toney maintained that Kirsanov should have disqualified Sattarkhanov for holding Juarez too often. Sattarkhanov, like many fighters in the tournament, spent a considerable amount of time grabbing in the clinches between the fighters, especially in the fourth round, when he had a large lead in points.</p>
        <p>Juarez, who is 5-foot-3, has had success fighting inside. He had won his last 68 consecutive fights.</p>
        <p>''I counted nine times that the referee cautioned the fighter from Kazakhstan,'' Toney said. ''After the third caution, he's supposed to issue a warning and deduct 2 points. After the fifth caution for holding, he should have disqualified the fighter.''</p>
        <p>Toney, however, later said that the rule book is not specific about how many cautions lead to a warning. He also said that the Americans believed Williams had won his fight, too. They didn't protest that decision because, Toney said, ''We didn't want people to feel this was all sour grapes.''</p>
        <p>Juarez suggested that there was a conspiracy between Sattarkhanov and Kirsanov.</p>
        <p>''Every time the ref broke us up,'' Juarez sadid, ''the Kazakhstan fighter said something, some word in another language that I didn't understand, to the referee. I knew pretty early on that something was up.</p>
        <p>''You're not even supposed to talk to the referee; you can get points deducted for that, too.''</p>
        <p>Toney conceded from the beginning that the Americans had little chance of having the decision overturned.</p>
        <p>''But this isn't subjective scoring by a bunch of judges,'' Toney said. ''This is a travesty. Before this fight, I was told this referee is one of the better ones in the world. How he could be so incompetent in one fight raises some questions.''</p>
        <p>Juarez trailed the entire fight, falling behind by 4-1 early in the first round. Sattar khanov is four inches taller than Juarez and scored easily with his left jab. Juarez has been effective in the tournament getting inside taller opponents, but even when he was free to work inside today, he did not find Sattarkhanov easy to hit.</p>
        <p>Sattarkhanov won the second round on points, 10-2, and Juarez grew desperate. But he had no chance to catch Sattarkhanov in the final round, when Sattarkhanov did clutch at Juarez whenever the American came toward him.</p>
        <p>Williams appeared sluggish after his difficult toe-to-toe victory over Diogenes Luna of Cuba in Friday night's semifinals. Williams won that fight, 42-41, the highest scoring bout of the tournament.</p>
        <p>Today, Williams fell behind early and never recovered. He was behind by 10-5 after two rounds and briefly closed the gap to 15-11 at the start of the fourth round. But Abdullaev, a world champion who defeated Williams in the world championships last year, appeared the stronger fighter in the end. With a series of quick left hands, he padded his lead to win on points, 27-20.</p>
        <p>''I have no excuses,'' Williams said. ''I came out a little slow, but I thought I did enough in the last two rounds to win.''</p>
        <p>In other gold medal bouts today, Wijan Ponlid of Thailand defeated Bulat Jumadilov, the reigning flyweight world champion from Kazakhstan, on points, 19-12.</p>
        <p>Yermakhan Ibraimov of Kazakhstan won the light-heavyweight class with a tight 25-23 decision on points over Marin Simion of Romania, and Audley Harrison of Britain won the superheavyweight division, defeating Mukhtarkhan Dildabekov of Kazakhstan.</p>
        <p>While the 2000 American team came into the Olympics hoping to be favorably compared with the 1976 United States team, which won five golds, it left with two silver medals and two bronze.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a sad way for it to end,'' Mustin said. ''I don't think we were given every shot, but the guys worked hard and tried their best. You'll still hear from some of them. A few, like Juarez, will have good pro careers.''</p>
