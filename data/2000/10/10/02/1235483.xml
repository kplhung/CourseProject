        <p>As Henry Liu riddles aliens with bullets from a compression rifle, he considers the advantages of having recently turned 17. His parents let him get his first driver's license, he points out, and he can now attend R-rated movies at will.</p>
        <p>He is also now of age to buy M-rated video games, which the game industry says should be marketed and sold only to those over 17. But Mr. Liu, playing a Star Trek game at a demonstration kiosk in a downtown computer store, said this particular rite of passage was moot.</p>
        <p>''I've been playing Doom, Quake, Unreal for three or four years,'' he said -- all games rated M (for mature), with graphic gore and violence. In Doom, for instance, Mr. Liu said he could use 10 weapons, including saws, shotguns and submachine guns, to kill human opponents, whose bodies explode and scatter when they are killed.</p>
        <p>For the video game industry, Mr. Liu and hundreds of thousands of other teenage players present a financial opportunity, but a sensitive one.</p>
        <p>A report last month by the Federal Trade Commission criticized game makers for deliberately marketing adult games to minors in violation of the industry's own policies. And it said retailers made it too easy for minors to buy those games.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the video game industry got higher marks in the report than the movie and music businesses. Jodie Z. Bernstein, director of the bureau of consumer protection for the Federal Trade Commission, said in an interview that the video game industry had ''the most comprehensive of all the self-regulatory bodies.''</p>
        <p>But ''that doesn't mean there has been full compliance'' with the policies by game makers, marketers and retailers, she added. ''The compliance has been, at best, mixed,'' Ms. Bernstein said.</p>
        <p>Among the points of contention are whether to curb advertising of M-rated games in magazines and on television programs with large teenage audiences, and whether retailers should require identification from those buying such games.</p>
        <p>It is a debate with substantial and explosively growing financial stakes. Sales of games for personal computers and video game consoles, like Sony's Playstation and the Nintendo 64, amounted to $5.5 billion in the United States last year, an increase from $4.7 billion in 1998, according to International Development Group, a San Francisco-based market research firm. Of last year's sales, roughly 10 percent were for games rated mature or adults only.</p>
        <p>As the game industry has gained a mass audience, mainstream retailers are increasingly sharing in the profits. For example, Wal-Mart and Best Buy together control more than a third of the market for Playstation games, according to International Development Group.</p>
        <p>But the specialty stores still account for a high percentage of sales. One such store, in downtown San Francisco, is EBX, where Mr. Liu has come to spend his lunch hour and to check out the latest games.</p>
        <p>He has traditionally been a good customer to the video game industry, spending, he said, $120 to $300 a month on games for his personal computer and his Playstation, Nintendo and Sega consoles. He said 20 of his 70 Playstation games were rated M, like Resident Evil II.</p>
        <p>What greets patrons are shelves stocked with hundreds of computer and video games, and their accessories: game guides, action figures, trading cards and game enthusiast magazines.</p>
        <p>In one corner, a demonstration kiosk features the game Star Trek Voyager, Elite Force, a so-called first-person shooter game in which players kill robots by firing an array of weapons, including a phaser.</p>
        <p>On the shelves, each box displays one of four Ratings: EC for early childhood, E for everyone, T for teenagers, or M for mature. There is a fifth rating, AO for adults only,  but many retailers decline to carry those titles, typically sexually explicit.</p>
        <p>Game makers and the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, the industry's self-regulatory body, say a game's rating depends not on a specific type of violence, but on its intensity, how graphic and realistic the gore, and whether the object is to destroy human beings or machines.</p>
        <p>For instance, violence is at the core of the Star Trek game being demonstrated at EBX, but the game is rated T. One reason is because the enemies are aliens, not humans. When they die, they fall to the ground, rather than spout blood or blow apart. But it is possible for a player to kill his own allies, who are human, and who writhe and moan when they are shot.</p>
        <p>''There's no blood, but you're still finishing him off with a heavy-powered weapon,'' said Chris Kelm, 25, a student, as he blew away a few Borg with his phaser, and tried to understand the distinction.</p>
        <p>The industry has said it is investing heavily in educating people about the rating system. One chain, Babbage's Etc., has posters in every store that explain the rating system, and includes an explanation on the back page of each advertising flier it sends out. It does not show M-rated games on in-store monitors.</p>
        <p>Executives at Electronics Boutique, which operates 520 EBX and Electronics Boutique stores nationwide, say they, too, send explanations with their mailings and plan to put posters in stores. But one retail clerk in the San Francisco store conceded that he did not really understand the rating system.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Liu and other teenagers say the rating system is largely irrelevant anyway, as they have been able to buy M-rated games for years. And this goes to the heart of one question facing retailers: whether they should require proof of a buyer's age.</p>
        <p>Target, Kmart and Wal-Mart have recently said that they will begin checking identification. But competitors like Babbage's and EBX have not followed suit, and they say there is good reason for their reluctance.</p>
        <p>They said they worry they will lose legitimate sales because some 17-year-olds will lack proper identification, will be offended and lost as lifelong customers if they are turned away, and could even sue, because the ratings are guidelines, not legal requirements. The retailers also argue that teenagers who want games can find them one way or another, including on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''It's not because we don't want to lose sales,'' said Dan DeMatteo, president of Babbage's, a chain that includes Software Etc. and Funcoland Stores, speaking of whether to ask for identification. ''It's an issue of whether we can do it effectively without opening ourselves up to liability.''</p>
        <p>The game industry says retailers should make their own choice. Doug Lowenstein, president of the International Digital Software Association, the parent of the ratings board, said, ''It is presumptuous of us to tell retailers how to run their business.''</p>
        <p>But whatever the retailers decide to do, the F.T.C. asserted in its report that the game makers themselves, through their advertising, were enticing minors to buy the adult games in the first place.</p>
        <p>Game makers insist that practice is ending. But even within the industry, there is deep disagreement about whether and how their advertising practices should be curbed.</p>
        <p>At the core of the debate are magazines for game enthusiasts, like GamePro, Playstation Magazine and Computer Gaming Monthly, which have substantial teenage readerships -- among them Mr. Liu -- but feature numerous advertisements for M-rated games.</p>
        <p>Take GamePro, a San Francisco publication that covers a broad range of games and whose monthly readership of 500,000 is also broadly drawn. Sixty-two percent of its readers are 17 or under, according to the magazine's associate publisher, Craig D. Lee.</p>
        <p>Of the advertising, 18 percent is for M-related games. The October issue has ads for at least six M-rated games, including Tenchu2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins, Duke Nukem, Land of the Babes and Heavy Metal F.A.K.K. 2, in which a G-string and bra-clad heroine pumps bullets into mutant aliens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee said his magazine was not wrong to publish the advertisements because ''we have the right to serve our community.'' He added that it was up to the game publishers to decide which ads to run and where to publish them. ''How advertisers chose to reach these gamers is their decision, not ours,'' Mr. Lee said.</p>
        <p>Game producers say they face something of a quandary in placing ads in magazines and on television shows with substantially teenage audiences.</p>
        <p>Marketing plans obtained by the F.T.C. showed campaigns aimed at networks like MTV and programs like ''Beavis and Butthead.'' But the companies say they have little choice but to advertise in the media their consumers read and watch.</p>
        <p>''It's not a perfect system, but it's the best system we have,'' said Martin R. Currie, director of marketing for Infogrames, publisher of the ultra-violent Duke Nukem games. He said his company left advertising purchases largely to its agency, instructing it only to hit the central demographic group, males 17 to 24.</p>
        <p>Edward S. Williams, a video game analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Company, a New York-based brokerage house, said game publishers should take more responsibility.</p>
        <p>''The buck has to stop with the publisher of the game,'' he said. ''It's their decision how they market their product.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bernstein, from the F.T.C., was harsher still.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to reach underage kids,'' she said. She said the commission was exploring whether criminal charges might apply to entertainment companies, including game companies, that deliberately aim adult content at children.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Liu said, young game players will hear about games -- if not through magazines, then through the grapevine -- and figure out how to buy them, whether by asking older friends or downloading them from the Internet.</p>
        <p>''People can get the games easily,'' he said of the mature titles. He should know: he's been getting them since he was 10 years old.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 6, 2000, Friday  An article in Business Day on Monday about the marketing of violent video games to children misstated the legal action that the Federal Trade Commission might take in such cases. Jodie Z. Bernstein, director of the commission's bureau of consumer protection, said the agency was exploring civil complaints over deceptive or unfair trade practices by game makers or other entertainment companies that market adult content to children. She did not say criminal charges might apply.</p>
