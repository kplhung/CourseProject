        <p>Three people were killed and four others were injured when two cars collided early yesterday at a busy intersection in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, the authorities said. The police said they suspected one of the cars ran a red light, but some residents said the light had been broken for two days.</p>
        <p>The police said the car, a red Nissan carrying three people, hit a black Acura with four people inside around 5:37 a.m. at the southwest corner of Stone and Blake Avenues, in front of Brownsville Houses, a city housing project. One of the people in the Nissan was listed in critical condition last night, and two were in stable condition at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn.</p>

        <p>Three people were killed and four others were injured when two cars collided early yesterday at a busy intersection in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, the authorities said. The police said they suspected one of the cars ran a red light, but some residents said the light had been broken for two days.</p>
        <p>The police said the car, a red Nissan carrying three people, hit a black Acura with four people inside around 5:37 a.m. at the southwest corner of Stone and Blake Avenues, in front of Brownsville Houses, a city housing project. One of the people in the Nissan was listed in critical condition last night, and two were in stable condition at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The Acura flipped over on its roof in the crash, and the four people inside had to be cut out by emergency workers, the police said. The driver of the Acura was declared dead at the scene, and two passengers died shortly afterward at Brooklyn Hospital Center, police said. The third passenger survived and was in critical condition last night at Kings County Hospital.</p>
        <p>The police did not release the victims' names, pending notification of their families.</p>
        <p>Although the police suspected the Nissan had run the light, several people who live in the area said one of the lights facing east on Blake Avenue, the direction that the police had said the Nissan was coming from, was damaged in a separate car accident on Friday, and the city had not fixed it.</p>
        <p>James Covington, 40, who had come out to look at the accident shortly after it occurred, said the light had been out for two days, as did other residents.</p>
        <p>Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, confirmed that one of the traffic lights facing east on Blake Avenue at the intersection had been damaged in Friday's accident, but said that had probably not contributed to the crash. He said there was a working backup light that the driver should have seen.</p>
        <p>''The second light is there for that reason,'' Mr. Cocola said. ''So that if there is a defect in one of the lights, the other one would act as backup until the other one can be fixed.'' All of the lights knocked out by yesterday's accident have since been repaired, he said.</p>
