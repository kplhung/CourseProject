        <p>Kresge's must have been having a heck of a sale that Christmas in 1938. Misses' blouses started at $1.50, children's shoes were $2 a pair and an ''apronette,'' a dress with a ''darling matching apron,'' was selling for $3.25.</p>
        <p>The sale signs -- along with miniature porcelain mannequins and wooden display cases -- remain scattered around the inside of the storefront, relics from a retail age that functioned in a subterranean trolley station.</p>
        <p>Sealed and forgotten more than 60 years ago, the station was recently rediscovered by transit workers unearthing a vast system of subway and trolley tunnels. The elegant Kresge's picture windows, now broken, once graced bustling streetcar platforms that led shoppers directly into stores like Kresge's, McCrory's and Stern's.</p>
        <p>Part of an extensive network that fanned out to the suburbs and beyond, Newark's fabled trolleys met their death with the advent of buses and automobiles, which began replacing them in the 1940's. Of 42 routes that at one time carried 2,000 trolleys and two million passengers a day, only the No. 7 line remains, a 4.2-mile run connecting Newark's Pennsylvania Station to the town of Belleville. That line, known as the Newark City Subway, carries 18,000 riders a day.</p>
        <p>But more than just an odd curiosity, the mothballed tunnel will play an important role in a modern mass transit project that seeks to resurrect the glory days of streetcar travel. As part of the $208 million new light rail line that will link Broad Street and Pennsylvania Stations to Newark International Airport, 1,000 feet of tunnel will be put into service again, shaving off a year from construction and saving at least $80 million, transit officials say. And with underground routes, they say, the system will move people faster than a line built at street level.</p>
        <p>''It's back to the future,'' Jeffrey Warsh, the executive director of New Jersey Transit, said this afternoon as he led reporters through the warren of dank tunnels, some of them dominated by the shapes of  antique rail cars that have not moved in decades.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Warsh, the abandoned tunnels are a sorry reminder of how another generation of planners trashed a viable transit system. ''It's a shame that all of the nation's cities will collectively spend trillions of dollars putting back what was once there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As New Jersey's largest city, and at one time its wealthiest, Newark had a trolley system second only to Chicago's. While most trolley cars shuttled along on street-level tracks, they sank below ground as they approached the congested city center. These subterranean lines were largely built on the bed of the defunct Morris Canal, which was drained in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>Trolley cars from the Oranges, Jersey City, Bound Brook and places as distant as Trenton poured into a downtown terminal that was owned by Public Service Coordinated Transport, the predecessor of New Jersey's power company, PSE&amp;G. Two levels of platforms were lined with shops; above, the terminal was topped by an 11-story office building. In 1917, a year after the terminal opened, more than 50,000 people a day were passing through its turnstiles.</p>
        <p>But the terminal was not long for this world. By 1937, when Pennsylvania Station opened, offering easy connections between street cars and Manhattan-bound commuter trains, the Public Service terminal became obsolete.</p>
        <p>For about three decades, buses continued to use some of the tunnels, but in 1978, PSE&amp;G replaced the entire complex with a glass skyscraper, including large sections of underground track.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, when transit officials started considering a light rail route to serve the newly built New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts and a minor league baseball stadium, they decided to explore the section of tunnel that had been severed by the building's foundation.</p>
        <p>Among those surprised by the rediscovery of the tunnel system was Mayor Sharpe James, who remembered the Public Service streetcar hub from his youth. ''Now that was a beehive of activity,'' he said wistfully as he walked below ground, a hard hat on his head. ''In those days you could go everywhere by trolley. You didn't need a car.''</p>
        <p>Although portions of unused tunnel are maintained by New Jersey Transit (vagrants are chased out from time to time), the tracks that once served Kresge's are rubble-strewn and pocked with gaping holes. The mouth to the tube is lined with a confounding assortment of junk, including an old bicycle, the hulk of a 1960's Firebird and a giant parking sign that advertises all-day parking for 95 cents.</p>
        <p>The lost station becomes visible, with the help of a flashlight, after climbing through a hole in a cinder block wall. With faded store signs, ornate window trim and empty, gift-wrapped display boxes, it is reminiscent of a scene from ''The Planet of the Apes'' series. The only thing missing are mummified shoppers. ''If you walk out ahead of everyone else, you'll see some really big rats,'' Mr. Warsh said.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, in a narrow tunnel 40 feet below Broad Street, transit officials showed off some of the vintage train cars that are kept underground, among them a 1911 iron-fronted plow and a 1921 track sweeper that is still called into action during heavy snow storms.</p>
        <p>''It's because of cars like this that our system is so dependable,'' said Kirk Wassong, superintendent of the Newark subways. Another train, a wood-sided contraption from the 1920's, is still used to string up the overhead power lines that feed the system. As Mr. Wassong spoke, a subway car filled with riders shuttled along on an adjacent track, its bell clanging in the dark. Built in the 1950's, these passenger cars are also close to being antique; it is a struggle to find spare parts for the cars, which were last refurbished in the early 1980's, Mr. Wassong said. Trolley aficionados, he said, are often the best source.</p>
        <p>But the entire fleet will soon be replaced by a modern one. Mr. Warsh said the transit agency had not yet decided what to do with the old cars, but that San Francisco's system of vintage trolley cars would love to buy them.</p>
        <p>But he cannot offer a second life to the orphaned stretches of tunnel that will not be recycled for the light rail system, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. James, on the other hand, seemed to overflow with possibilities as he emerged back into the daylight. He talked about a peddlers' marketplace, movie studios or a shopping mall featuring food and live music.</p>
        <p>''You've heard of underground Atlanta?'' he asked, referring to that city's subterranean mall. ''Well how about underground Newark? I think it could be a splendid thing. Anything's better than a sealed tomb.''</p>
