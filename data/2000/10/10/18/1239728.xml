        <p>Markets may be rocky, but there was not much sign of trouble in the strong third-quarter earnings reported by Citigroup and Merrill Lynch yesterday.</p>
        <p>Citigroup's profit, excluding special charges, beat analysts' estimates, rising 27 percent, to $3.1 billion, or 67 cents a share, from $2.4 billion in the period last year. At Merrill, profits rose 53 percent, to $885 million, or 94 cents a share, from $579 million a year ago.</p>

        <p>Markets may be rocky, but there was not much sign of trouble in the strong third-quarter earnings reported by Citigroup and Merrill Lynch yesterday.</p>
        <p>Citigroup's profit, excluding special charges, beat analysts' estimates, rising 27 percent, to $3.1 billion, or 67 cents a share, from $2.4 billion in the period last year. At Merrill, profits rose 53 percent, to $885 million, or 94 cents a share, from $579 million a year ago.</p>
        <p>The strong results did not help the performance of either company's shares. Both stocks fell yesterday amid a generally weak market. Citigroup's shares declined $1.44, to $49.38, while Merrill's stock fell 56 cents, to $57.81 a share.</p>
        <p>The two companies' results were driven by very different factors. Citigroup benefited from a 44 percent increase in profits at its Salomon Smith Barney brokerage division, where overseas acquisitions pushed investment banking revenue to almost $1 billion, a record. A quarter of the division's profits this quarter came from overseas, where Citigroup acquired the Schroders investment bank in London last January and started a joint venture with Nikko Securities in Japan.</p>
        <p>''We are beginning to see the results of these efforts,'' said Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weill noted that Citigroup expected to close its $31 billion acquisition of Associates First Capital, a consumer finance company, by the end of the year. Analysts said that should help the performance of Citigroup's consumer business, which had a 17 percent increase in profits.</p>
        <p>Merrill relied on cost-cutting to widen profit margins at existing businesses. The pretax profit margin was 21.3 percent in the quarter, up from 19 percent in the 1999 period. Cost-cutting accounted for about half of Merrill's $300 million profit increase in the quarter.</p>
        <p>The margin increase means Merrill is on track with a goal its executives set last May, when they pledged at a meeting with investors to increase pretax profit margins to 24 percent by 2003. ''Even with modest top-line growth we can show very attractive net income growth,'' said Thomas Patrick, Merrill's chief financial officer. That could be reassuring to investors anticipating a cyclical slowdown.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Citigroup, Merrill did not have as strong a quarter in investment banking. Revenue in that business was down 10 percent compared with a year ago, mainly because of lower fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions.</p>
        <p>''I would view Salomon's numbers as unusually strong rather than see Merrill's results as particularly weak,'' said Joan Solotar, a brokerage firm analyst who follows both Merrill and Citigroup at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>Analysts who follow both companies said they were concerned about the fourth quarter, given the recent weakness in the stock market, as well as the markets for high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.</p>
        <p>''The two big anxieties right now are worries about investment banking and the state of the commercial credit market,'' noted David Berry, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, a brokerage firm specializing in the financial services industry. ''A lot of the market weakness has occurred since the end of the quarter, so these strong results don't necessarily put worries to rest.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Solotar noted, the stock market also lagged in September 1999, then rebounded strongly before year's end. ''I would expect estimates to come down,'' she said, ''but the backlog is strong, and we could yet see strong results.''</p>
