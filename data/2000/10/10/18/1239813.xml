        <p>Donna Hanover, the estranged wife of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, delivered monologues last night about orgasm, lesbian sex and the rape of Bosnian women in her debut performance in the Off Broadway hit ''The Vagina Monologues.''</p>
        <p>In her longest monologue, she even imitated the rousing sounds of different kinds of women having sex, a performance that brought down the house in cheers and applause.</p>
        <p>''I think you got your money's worth,'' her fellow performer Susie Essman said to the crowd. ''Who knew?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover also delivered a monologue about a woman she described as a lesbian ''sex worker'' who had abandoned a career as a lawyer to bring sexual pleasure to other women.</p>
        <p>''There was nothing like this in tax law,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani spent his evening at the Yankee playoff game.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover's only indirect reference to her husband was one knowing sentence. ''This monologue was based on an interview with a woman who had a good experience with a man,'' she said, to laughter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover's appearance has been long anticipated. Still, her 90-minute performance with Robin Givens and Ms. Essman at the Westside Theater had none of the political impact that undoubtedly would have mesmerized the city had her husband stayed in the Senate race, or had her marital problems not exploded so publicly last spring.</p>
        <p>Her debut also came on the same night that the Yankees were on the verge of a Subway Series and George W. Bush and Al Gore had a third presidential debate, in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''Who thought that after the first debate anybody would still be paying attention?'' said Bob Fennell, a spokesman for the play.</p>
        <p>But the 250-seat theater was filled. Many seats were taken by Ms. Hanover's friends, among them Ellen Levine, the editor in chief of Good Housekeeping, and the comedian Joan Rivers, who is also a friend and supporter of Mr. Giuliani's. ''I keep out of these things,'' she said of the couple's problems. ''I have two phone numbers. They can call me on separate lines.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fennell said the show was nearly sold out for Ms. Hanover's three-week run, which he described as ''a little unusual.''</p>
        <p>The play, based on interviews with women from 6 to 75 exploring their feelings about their most intimate anatomy, has attracted a rotating series of actresses, among them Winona Ryder, Calista Flockhart and Whoopi Goldberg, who read a lament called ''My Angry Vagina.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover's original acceptance of a role in ''The Vagina Monologues'' was the first in a chain of events that became part of the mayor's unraveling personal and political life last spring.</p>
        <p>On April 20, Ms. Hanover, who had long led a separate life from Mr. Giuliani, announced that she would be appearing in the play with the actresses Kirstie Alley and Hazelle Goodman. Few people in political and theatrical circles failed to notice that the play was written by Eve Ensler, a friend and supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was then Mr. Giuliani's Senate opponent.</p>
        <p>On April 27, Mr. Giuliani announced that he had prostate cancer. On May 1, Ms. Hanover said she was postponing her performance in the play because of ''personal family circumstances.'' On May 3, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that he had a ''very good friend'' in Judith Nathan, a pharmaceutical sales representative whom friends now say he is in love with. On May 19, Mr. Giuliani withdrew from the Senate race.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover and Mr. Giuliani continue to live with their two children at Gracie Mansion.</p>
        <p>After her performance, Ms. Hanover made brief remarks to reporters on the sidewalk outside the theater.</p>
        <p>''This is wonderful material,'' she said. ''It's very textured, it's rich, it's multilayered, it's about women, it's about birth, it's about the difficult things that women face, it's about self-acceptance, it's glorious to me.''</p>
