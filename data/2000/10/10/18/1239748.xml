        <p>Seven years after President Clinton presided over a historic handshake between Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the Rose Garden, he tried one more time today to move the Middle East toward some kind of lasting peace.</p>
        <p>But today, all he could do was read an agreement that neither Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, nor Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was willing to sign, to read aloud or to answer questions about.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton flew halfway around the world on short notice to get that agreement -- in effect, to provide what one diplomat called ''a mutual climb-down mechanism'' -- after the deadliest eruption of violence in the Middle East since the president helped initiate the Oslo process.</p>
        <p>It was expected to be the last such role Mr. Clinton would play before his successor is elected in three weeks, and possibly before leaving the White House.</p>
        <p>But it was still a pivotal role. Mr. Clinton's personality and his ability to connect with Mr. Arafat provided a constant thread through the negotiations, American officials and other participants at the summit meeting said. His back-to-back, separate sessions with Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat were a crucial bridge between two men no longer able even to meet face to face.</p>
        <p>What the president achieved was better than a breakdown in talks, and better than not coming at all, his senior advisers said afterward. Still, Mr. Clinton best expressed the sudden dive in Middle East fortunes and the difficulties in restoring them when he told the news conference today, ''We should have no illusions about the difficulties ahead.''</p>
        <p>Just as he did seven years ago when he was the host on the White House lawn for a handshake between Mr. Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, Mr. Clinton had to rely on the help of others at Sharm el Sheik.</p>
        <p>This morning, when the summit meeting came to a boil over Mr. Arafat's insistence on a fact-finding mission into the violence in late September, Mr. Clinton called on the Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak to help him out. And before the summit meeting began, Mr. Clinton had the assistance of the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, who shuttled between Israel and the Palestinian territories for two days, using his moral persuasion to get Mr. Arafat to attend the meeting.</p>
        <p>This morning with Mr. Mubarak at his side, Mr. Clinton drew Mr. Arafat into a room. Mr. Clinton explained, according to a senior administration official, that Mr. Barak has agreed to withdraw to military positions as they existed before Sept. 28 and to reopen crossings to the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
        <p>The official said Mr. Clinton then put a couple of pointed arguments before Mr. Arafat: Wasn't this more important to his people than an inquiry? Wasn't it more important to keep the foundation agreement of the summit meeting rather than vitiate it on the composition of a summit? Mr. Arafat finally agreed to American domination of the inquiry.</p>
        <p>With that, Mr. Clinton emerged from the summit meeting with his relations with Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat apparently intact. The Palestinian, in contrast to his delegation, showed remarkable restraint in his rhetoric, an aide to Mr. Clinton said. Mr. Barak, whom the president first got to know nearly 18 months ago when he was the new prime minister of Israel, was in a way Mr. Clinton's dream Israeli prime minister. Mr. Barak had run on a platform of peace, but now that dream had been broken. Even so, Mr. Barak returned to Israel tonight with Mr. Clinton's friendship as firm as ever, the White House said.</p>
        <p>For this summit meeting, Mr. Clinton set limited, though realistic, goals, the White House said before it began. And on paper, he appeared to have achieved them. But the fruits of this meeting were a long way from the deal he was so close to closing at Camp David three months ago.</p>
        <p>''If this hasn't exploded in six weeks, we'll know the peace process is irreversible,'' a member of Mr. Clinton's Middle East peace team said, clinging to the hope that a scheduled meeting in two weeks of negotiators for both sides in Washington might reinvigorate what seemed so fruitful at Camp David.</p>
