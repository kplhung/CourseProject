        <p>''LARGE coffee please.''</p>
        <p>''That's called a grande,'' the guy behind the coffee counter at the US Airways terminal in La Guardia Airport informed me last week.</p>

        <p>''LARGE coffee please.''</p>
        <p>''That's called a grande,'' the guy behind the coffee counter at the US Airways terminal in La Guardia Airport informed me last week.</p>
        <p>''O.K., a grande, black.''</p>
        <p>''That's $2.05.''</p>
        <p>''But the sign up there says a grande costs $1.60.''</p>
        <p>''Sign's wrong. We have not yet received the new sign. Next! Next!''</p>
        <p>Slightly irritated, I paid up, grabbed my coffee, and wandered to the gate to await boarding of my early-morning flight to New Orleans, thinking that this kind of encounter would occur only in an airport. Anywhere else, I'd balk a little more at the mismarked price and the attitude that came with it.</p>
        <p>Cut to four days later, at the New Orleans International Airport. Stepping through the security gate for my early morning return flight to New York, I somehow set off the alarm. Embarrassed, I dig into my pockets, fish out a wayward dime, walk through once more. Again, the alarm goes off.</p>
        <p>''Get over there!'' a security agent yells in the tone of voice that a prison guard uses with a convict.</p>
        <p>Arms spread, I am frisked with an electronic gizmo, which keeps bleating. Now there are three guards surrounding me, barking orders. Finally, I find a fragment of a roll of mints in a pocket, and display the torn wrapper.</p>
        <p>''He's got tin foil!'' one of the guards shouts.</p>
        <p>Run for your lives! I'm thinking sarcastically. But I keep my big mouth shut. Feeling like the newly released criminal suspect that in fact I was, I sheepishly collect my carry-on from the belt and skulk on to my gate.</p>
        <p>We business travelers expend so much energy griping about the airlines -- which at least still define us as customers -- that we sometimes forget that a large part of the flying experience is framed by airports, a few of which would use cattle prods on us if they could figure out how to get around the Geneva Convention. However, other airports -- my own domestic favorites include Tampa, John Wayne and Tucson International Airports -- are pleasant and welcoming, showing that it can be done if the will is there.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, I asked readers to send me their own assessments of airports -- good, bad and ugly. Today, I'm only able to excerpt a tiny sampling of their comments, though I'll excerpt more from time to time as the topic comes up. Also, I'm not using names because of the difficulty of verifying e-mail signatures. But the response was impressive, as one correspondent predicted it would be.</p>
        <p>''My, you are a brave soul, inviting people's opinions on airports,'' this reader wrote, forwarding his own detailed assessments of airports that he has been through in the last year. ''Bet it takes you a while to dig out of your e-mail on this one. There's something cathartic about being able to dish one's most-hated airports."</p>
        <p>His candidate for the worst: Detroit Metro. It's ''an airport so dysfunctional, even the Starbucks are crummy,'' he wrote. ''The place seems to magnify noise. The CNN Airport channel, stationed every 20 feet, is cranked up full volume, so it is impossible to hear the many gate-change announcements. Also, there's something about the way they've managed to blend the smell of jet-fuel exhaust with Cinnabuns.''</p>
        <p>Other airports he'd just as soon avoid include big sprawls like Los Angeles International: ''A half-dozen terminals in separate time-zones.'' The same with Dallas-Fort Worth International which, he claims, has ''a layout inspired by the 'Where's Waldo' books.''</p>
        <p>At Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, this reader found the food so uninspiring that ''while I was waiting there, I saw a family send out for pizza.'' And he says to forget about Logan International in Boston, which he derides as ''an enigma wrapped inside a landfill.''</p>
        <p>Not that this particular correspondent is a complete grouch. He loves the ''rational layout, roomy concourses and variety of services'' at Pittsburgh International; considers Denver International ''bright and comfy;'' and has a soft spot for the airports at Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., saying: ''O.K., so they're lined with casinos. But they're still relatively calm, roomy and modestly laid out.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, here are some other reader assessments:</p>
        <p>''The best? Albuquerque, N.M.,'' writes a corporate travel planner who describes that airport as ''the least stressful'' in the country. The worst in this reader's view? International arrivals at Kennedy International, ''an almost Kubrickian fantasy of technology meets planning disaster meets the Third World meeting the Port Authority.''</p>
        <p>About a dozen readers name O'Hare International in Chicago as among the best, suggesting that big doesn't have to be bad. Denver International and Hartsfield International at Atlanta are mentioned by some as among the worst, but others name them with the best. No one seems to have a good word for Miami International. But Tampa International gets a few votes beside my own -- ''beautifully laid out, neat and clean, spotlessly maintained with a nice assortment of shops and restaurants,'' says one writer.</p>
        <p>International airports? Several readers praise Hamburg Airport in Germany. ''Great for connections. Beautiful shops,'' says one. The worst? One reader really gives it to Rio de Janeiro International. ''A nightmare,'' he avers. ''Departing during high season feels like trying to get out on the last flight from Saigon.''</p>
