        <p>The two candidates for the Senate from New Jersey, Jon S. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks, disagreed again tonight on American policy on a recent United Nations resolution criticizing Israel's role in the violence in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>The candidates, appearing before 150 people at a forum at Temple B'nai Abraham, differed over the United States' abstaining from a vote on a Security Council resolution that criticized Israel for ''excessive use of force'' in the armed clashes with Palestinians.</p>
        <p>While vowing an ''absolute commitment of faith'' to protect Israel's  security, including the use of American troops if necessary, Mr. Corzine said nonetheless that he supported President Clinton's decision not to veto the Oct. 7 resolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said he believed the United States abstained as part of a Clinton administration strategy to prompt Palestinians to join peace talks to end the fighting.</p>
        <p>''I support the president,'' Mr. Corzine told the crowd, ''and I don't think many of us on the outside of that process have the information to make those judgments as clearly as the president.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Corzine spoke, Representative Franks denounced the abstention. He said that America was obliged as the world's only superpower to bring a lasting peace to the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Calling the Security Council resolution a ''blatant, one-sided, anti-Israeli'' measure, he said it would not bring the Israelis and Palestinians together or strengthen the prospects for peace. He said it should have been vetoed immediately.</p>
        <p>''When the United Nations gangs up on Israel, it is America's obligation to stand up for Israel,'' Mr. Franks said to applause.</p>
        <p>The violence in the Middle East has preoccupied Jews in New Jersey since it flared in late September, said David Mallach, assistant executive vice president of the United Jewish Federation of MetroWest, which sponsored the forum. Sixty-five congregations throughout Essex, Morris, Sussex and northern Union Counties are affiliated with the organization.</p>
        <p>As a measure of that preoccupation, about 1,000 Jews gathered inside the temple before the arrival of Mr. Corzine and Mr. Franks and held a solidarity rally supporting Israel. Most of the crowd left before the forum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mallach said that if the forum had been held three weeks ago, the dominant themes would probably  have been health care for the elderly and the federal role in education. But now, he said, American policy on the Middle East is the biggest issue.</p>
        <p>He said the ''majority of the Jewish community'' in New Jersey believes the Clinton administration should have vetoed the resolution in the Security Council. Mr. Mallach said he thought Mr. Corzine''s standing among Jews had suffered because he endorsed the abstention.</p>
        <p>In his first debate with Representative Franks, on Oct. 8, Mr. Corzine said he approved of the abstention, without explaining why. In their second debate four days later, Mr. Franks criticized Mr. Corzine's position and said the United States should have vetoed the resolution.</p>
        <p>In New York's Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Republican opponent, Rick A. Lazio, have, in a rare moment of agreement, criticized the United States for abstaining on the resolution.</p>
