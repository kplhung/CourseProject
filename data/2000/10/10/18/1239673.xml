        <p>IT was only a matter of time before someone put quote marks around the old-fashioned American steakhouse. Strip House is not so much a steakhouse as a catalog of hip references to the idea of a steakhouse, a kind of restaurant that really has no natural place in the heart of Greenwich Village. Without the quotes, Strip House would be naked.</p>
        <p>As the name suggests, there's a burlesque theme hard at work here. The omnipresent David Rockwell has lined the walls with lust-red flocked wallpaper and upholstered the banquettes in quilted red leather. Vintage photographs of old-time strippers cover the walls, spicing up the mix of opera singers and 20-watt celebrities from a bygone era, left over from the days when the restaurant was Asti's. It all makes for a cheery, comfortable atmosphere, with none of the backslapping locker-room style of the old-line steakhouses, where big men take off their jackets, roll up their sleeves and get down to the business of eating big, unadorned slabs of beef. Strip House is a steakhouse for sissies, which means I can eat there without feeling like the second-string water boy.</p>

        <p>IT was only a matter of time before someone put quote marks around the old-fashioned American steakhouse.

Without the quotes, Strip House would be naked.</p>
        <p>As the name suggests, there's a burlesque theme hard at work here. The omnipresent David Rockwell has lined the walls with lust-red flocked wallpaper and upholstered the banquettes in quilted red leather. Vintage photographs of old-time strippers cover the walls, spicing up the mix of opera singers and 20-watt celebrities from a bygone era, left over from the days when the restaurant was Asti's. It all makes for a cheery, comfortable atmosphere, with none of the backslapping locker-room style of the old-line steakhouses, where big men take off their jackets, roll up their sleeves and get down to the business of eating big, unadorned slabs of beef. Strip House is a steakhouse for sissies, which means I can eat there without feeling like the second-string water boy.</p>
        <p>Peter and Penny Glazier, the owners of Tapika and Monkey Bar, already have one steakhouse under their belts, Michael Jordan's in Grand Central Terminal. For the tongue-in-cheek Strip House, they have empowered David Walzog, their executive chef, and Wayne Brachman, their executive pastry chef, to play with the steakhouse formula without actually getting rid of steaks. The result, although pleasing enough, is neither fish nor fowl. True worshipers at the altar of red meat will find Strip House insufficiently pagan. Younger diners will probably feel that there's a little too much uptown in this downtown spot. And the rest of us may well ask, What, exactly, is the point?</p>
        <p>Steak occupies center stage, as it must. The meat here is respectable, but not much more than that. I found the awesome rib chop, looking like a blunt weapon on the plate, awfully fatty, but the swaggering porterhouse came through in a big way, seared aggressively to achieve a deep crunch, all rubescent tender meat within. The filet mignon and New York strip steaks were perfectly acceptable, but neither called for that moment of respectful silence that the choicest, most flavorful beef inspires.</p>
        <p>Strip House plays it straight with the steaks. The rest of the menu, however, shows a more playful side. Lamb comes in a three-way dish listed on the menu as Menage a Trois. It is much more restrained than it sounds, an artfully assembled sculpture consisting of a first-rate chop, a loin and a braised flank, with a sprig of rosemary planted in the loin like a flag. One diner can manage it.</p>
        <p>The time-honored side dishes are reinterpreted a bit, and new ones have been added. Creamed spinach, which reminds me of baby food at most steakhouses, has some tooth to it at Strip House. The spinach is finely chopped and perfumed with truffles. Vegetables en papillote turns out to be a large parchment bag that opens up to reveal a cornucopia of little steamed prizes in a creamy lemon vinaigrette: pattypan squash, baby carrots, baby corn, candy cane beets and lots more. The potato fix comes three ways, depending on your mood: as a puree of fingerling potatoes, as deep-fried spuds or as a dark-golden dome of potatoes, crusty after frying in goose fat.</p>
        <p>This mildly antic disposition can be felt throughout the menu. Braised short-rib flan, one of the more arresting appetizers, wears the guise of a flan but is actually braised meat encased in a smooth wrapper of endive, with a port reduction sauce, roasted garlic cloves and chanterelle mushrooms. Skate meets snail in one of the more surreal culinary encounters of recent years, made legitimate by a sharp, suave lemon parsley sauce. The final bit of cheek in this nonsteakhouse is the steak that's not a steak: a block of tofu masquerading as steak au poivre.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brachman, who made the desserts at Mesa Grill for years, tries to enter into the fun, with mixed results. The grand chocolate profiterole squats on the plate like some rough beast summoned from a chocolate tar pit. Stuffed with two kinds of chocolate ice cream, covered in hot fudge sauce and splashed with raspberry coulis, it's a dessert that asks to be smeared all over the face of a 5-year-old. The chocolate fondue for two tries a little too hard to be cute. It's a retro fun ride that invites diners to dip chunks of chocolate-coconut poundcake, strawberries and pineapple in a soup of molten chocolate. Squashy spiral-form toasted marshmallows underscore the message: this is a wild and crazy dessert. Whee!</p>
        <p>I much preferred the fruit savarin, accompanied by toasted brioche, an ethereal Marsala sabayon and crunchy slices of toasted almond. That's more fun than a quiverful of fondue forks, in my book. There's not a thing wrong with the raspberry crepes suzette, either, and the caramelized apple tart with mascarpone ice cream and brown sugar hard sauce is as good as it sounds.</p>
        <p>Everything about Strip House feels very busy and very conceptualized. Once you peel back the layers of meaning and get a few chuckles out of the decor, what's left? A nice restaurant with some pretty good food. Manhattan has a lot of those.</p>
