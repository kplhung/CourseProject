        <p>In the month after his installation as head of New York's Roman Catholic archdiocese in 1984, Archbishop John J. O'Connor cut an ebullient, outspoken and photogenic figure, making rounds of parishes and schools.</p>
        <p>He joined 4,000 Staten Islanders for a ferryboat ride to their borough, where a marching band greeted his arrival. On other occasions, he met with schoolchildren and stockbrokers, tried on baseball caps and even played host to President Reagan at a charity dinner. Along the way, he said he saw goodness in the faces of everyone he met. And in speech after speech, he declared his opposition to abortion.</p>
        <p>If this is worth recalling, 16 years later, it is mainly to note the difference in the public style being established by his successor, Archbishop Edward M. Egan, installed in June after 12 years as bishop of Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
        <p>With little flash or fanfare, the new archbishop has been acquainting himself with his new territory, whose wide ethnic diversity, status as a cultural and media capital and importance to the Vatican make it one of the most complex and demanding in the Catholic Church in the United States.</p>
        <p>For Archbishop Egan, that has meant briefings by those who oversee the archdiocese's departments, and, more recently, meetings with priests, parishioners, academics and labor leaders, as well as people who come to watch the parades that pass by St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p>
        <p>Along the way, according to those who have met him, the archbishop has been making a mark as an urbane and affable prelate, a preacher fond of illustrating his homilies with personal or historical anecdotes, and a careful listener who can make those he meets feel they have his full attention.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, Archbishop Egan will step into national view when he presides over a venerable political event, the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner, a charity fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria sponsored by the archdiocese. The occasion represents the restoration of local tradition: for the first time in 12 years, the dinner will be attended by the presidential candidates of both major parties, in this case, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>In 1992, a presidential debate was scheduled on the same night as the dinner, and President George Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton declined the invitation. Four years ago, the dinner's organizers invited neither President Clinton nor Senator Bob Dole because, some officials in the archdiocese said, Cardinal O'Connor was angered by Mr. Clinton's veto of a bill that would have banned a late-term abortion procedure.</p>
        <p>During his first two months in office, Archbishop Egan was involved in what Joseph G. Zwilling, the archdiocese's spokesman, called ''big picture time,'' studying the nuts and bolts of his jurisdiction, through presentations by the people who run the archdiocese's departments, schools and hospitals. The new prelate presides over an archdiocese of 2.4 million parishioners that encompasses Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island as well as Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Sullivan, Ulster and Dutchess Counties.</p>
        <p>The goal was to give Archbishop Egan ''a handle on where everything is, where everything stands,'' Mr. Zwilling said. The archbishop was unavailable for comment.</p>
        <p>Some say the vivid public memory of Cardinal O'Connor may actually have helped Archbishop Egan by giving him time to settle into office.</p>
        <p>Archbishop O'Connor took up his duties under quite different circumstances, in the first stage of an unusual period of transition among major American archdioceses in the mid-1980's. Within about 18 months, the Vatican appointed new archbishops for New York, Boston and Los Angeles, choosing men who were more outspoken than their predecessors.</p>
        <p>In New York, Archbishop O'Connor succeeded Cardinal Terence Cooke, a painstaking manager who generally shunned the spotlight. In Boston, Archbishop Bernard Law followed Cardinal Humberto Medeiros, and in Los Angeles, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony succeeded Cardinal Timothy Manning.</p>
        <p>Referring to the transitions in New York and Los Angeles, the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of America, a Jesuit magazine, said that if these archbishops seemed to come on strong, ''part of that may have been in reaction to their predecessors, who were very, very low-key.''</p>
        <p>''Egan comes into New York and he doesn't have to do that because everyone knows the church is alive and well in New York -- because of O'Connor,'' Father Reese said. ''I think he's being very wise by taking his time, listening to people, getting briefed by his staff, before he decides what mark he's going to try to make on the archdiocese and on the American church.''</p>
        <p>The archbishop has drawn favorable notice among those who have heard him preach or met him in small gatherings. During a Labor Day Mass, he supported the right of workers to organize, in line with Catholic social teaching. On Oct. 1, designated by the church as Respect Life Sunday, he spoke against the federal Food and Drug Administration's approval of RU-486, the abortion pill.</p>
        <p>Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, described the archbishop's Labor Day homily as ''very strong.'' Later in September, he met Archbishop Egan, bringing along other labor leaders for a get-acquainted conversation.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLaughlin said that the archbishop disagreed with his opposition to school vouchers, but that they shared a conviction about the need to help the poor and immigrants. ''I have to say he extended himself to me and the guests I brought with me in a significant way,'' he said. ''There was an effort to welcome us and make us feel at home and to have an honest dialogue.''</p>
        <p>It is in such intimate settings that the archbishop may be making his biggest impression. Before recent parades, on Labor Day, Columbus Day and Hispanic Day, he has gone outside St. Patrick's Cathedral to shake hands and talk with people gathered on the steps and sidewalks.</p>
        <p>Three times in the last two months, he has met with groups of priests, at one point organizing a picnic and inviting all the archdiocese's priests.</p>
        <p>''People do look for signals,'' said Msgr. Philip J. Murnion, director of the National Pastoral Life Center in New York. ''There are a number of things that he has done that have been very encouraging to people.''</p>
        <p>Archbishop Egan visited a gathering for new parish pastors, in Spring Lake, N.J., in August. ''The priests were very enthusiastic about the way he had visited with them and how he had preached,'' Monsignor Murnion said.</p>
        <p>The Rev. John P. Duffell, the pastor of the Church of the Ascension on West 107th Street, attended and said, ''He respects the dignity of the person with whom he's talking.''</p>
        <p>Archbishop Egan also drew a warm response at Fordham University, a Jesuit institution, when he celebrated a Mass at its campus near Lincoln Center in September. In his homily, he praised the Jesuits not just for their intellectual endeavors, but also for their devotion to forming their students' spiritual character.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Egan said Jesuit-run education was ''where the life of the mind and the life of faith work in tandem,'' said the Rev. Gerald Blaszczak, the university chaplain. ''He was warm, affable. He struck an unmitigatedly affirmative tone.''</p>
        <p>In a gesture that did not go unnoticed, the archbishop ''turned to thank the music director and the choir,'' said Joan Cavanagh, associate director of campus ministry.</p>
        <p>The same month, Archbishop Egan made his first parish visit, dedicating a church building at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Parish in Tappan, Rockland County. The Rev. John F. Dwyer, the pastor, said the archbishop spoke about public church dedications' being part of a tradition that went back to the time of Constantine, the Roman emperor.</p>
        <p>''We're replicating what's been done for the last 1,700 years,'' Father Dwyer said, paraphrasing Archbishop Egan's homily. ''But the church is really the people of God, and you are to be God's people.'' After Mass, the archbishop spent time talking with parishioners, then walked to the rectory to meet with the priests.</p>
        <p>Afterward, he sent Father Dwyer a gift, a copy of ''The Five Books of Moses,'' a translation of the Pentateuch by the scholar Everett Fox, along with extra copies of photographs of the event, taken for the archdiocesan newspaper. ''I've had two letters of thank you from him,'' Father Dwyer said.</p>
