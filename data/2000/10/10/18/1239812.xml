        <p>After 28 hours of intensive diplomatic intervention, the Israelis and the Palestinians agreed today to take immediate steps to apply a tourniquet to the bloodshed and prevent the raging violence in the West Bank and Gaza from turning into a cataclysmic escalation.</p>
        <p>Israel will reopen the Gaza airport, end the border closings and withdraw forces now stationed at the edge of Palestinian territories, according to the agreement. The Palestinians will move to stop the riots and gun battles, crack down on incitement against Israel, and rearrest Islamic fundamentalists who were released from prison last week.</p>
        <p>With his eyes puffy from lack of sleep, President Clinton announced the truce this afternoon at the head of a horseshoe-shaped table surrounded by foreign leaders who flew in to mediate the crisis. Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, sat far apart, made no eye contact and -- an American decision -- did not utter a word.</p>
        <p>The cease-fire understanding, produced amid considerable rancor, was considered too fragile to be put at risk by public statements. Even as it was being announced, some Palestinians in the West Bank were protesting that Mr. Arafat, who left Egypt quickly to return to Gaza, had been railroaded into accepting watered-down compromises on his key demands.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, sporadic gun battles continued in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Two Palestinians were reported killed and three Israeli policemen were wounded, one critically.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton addressed each side's uncertainty about whether the cease-fire would be respected. The days  ahead will be a crucial test period, all agree, of the leaders' resolve and of whether the rage that has been released can be contained.</p>
        <p>''We have made important commitments here today against the backdrop of tragedy and crisis,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''We should have no illusions about the difficulties ahead.'' [Text, Page A14.]</p>
        <p>In a sign of their deteriorated relationship, the two sides made no commitments directly to each other. Nor did they put anything in writing.</p>
        <p>Rather, the Israelis and the Palestinians both made separate oral  promises to the Americans, who will return to their former role as broker, policeman and judge.</p>
        <p>The Americans played that role under former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Barak immediately sought to end it when he took office, preferring to establish a face-to-face dynamic with the Palestinians. But that dynamic has become a mutual cold shoulder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said today that the Israelis and the Palestinians had agreed to make unequivocal public calls for an end of violence as a kind of reveille trumpeting the start of the truce.</p>
        <p>After he arrived home, Mr. Barak issued a statement saying that he had instructed Israeli security forces to carry out the agreement and work jointly with their American and Palestinian counterparts. Indeed, a security cooperation meeting was planned for late tonight between Israeli and Palestinian officers whose forces have been shooting at each other in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>''I would like to emphasize that the Israeli Defense Forces and Israel police will take great care to halt the violence and prevent additional loss of life,'' Mr. Barak said. ''In recent weeks, violence has surged in our region and Israeli and Palestinian lives have been lost. We regret this.</p>
        <p>''We now have before us an additional opportunity to get back on track towards stability, coexistence and cooperation,'' he continued. ''I expect that our Palestinian neighbors share this hope with us.''</p>
        <p>Returning to Gaza, Mr. Arafat gave a brief statement that reserved judgment on the agreement. ''The most important thing is implementation and we expect an honest and accurate one,'' he said. It was unclear when and if he would make his public call for an end to the violence, although the agreement does not stipulate that he has to do so personally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said Israel would pull back its heavy military equipment in 48 hours if quiet prevailed.</p>
        <p>But the reality on the ground presented an immediate challenge to such aspirations.</p>
        <p>A world away from this shimmering Red Sea resort town, Palestinian militants said they rejected the call to lay down their rocks and guns, saying that they were in the midst of an uprising. Gun battles erupted in Nablus and Gaza. A Palestinian man was killed by Jewish settlers, who said later that they had acted in self-defense.</p>
        <p>And, unthinkable just weeks ago, Jewish residents of the Gilo neighborhood in Jerusalem flung themselves on the ground as bullets rained onto their streets. Also unthinkable, Israeli tanks shot back at the source of fire in the Arab neighborhood of Beit Jala.</p>
        <p>Asked here if Mr. Arafat was capable of restoring order, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said, ''He may not be totally in control of everything but he has the authority.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton said that the leaders agreed to ''end the current confrontation, eliminate points of friction, ensure an end to violence and incitement, maintain calm and prevent recurrence of recent events.'' Further, they agreed to consult with American officials in two weeks time in order to weigh their progress and contemplate reconstructing their fractured peacemaking relationship, Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, who has repeatedly declared that Mr. Arafat is no longer a partner for peace, did not want any reference to further negotiations in the agreement. But President Clinton insisted.</p>
        <p>The decision puts Mr. Barak, whose hold on power is tenuous, in limbo for the next two weeks, at which time the Israeli Parliament will reconvene after a long summer break and consider motions to dissolve the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said today that he was still prepared to form an emergency unity government with the right wing. But in embracing, however lukewarmly, the possibility of renewed peace talks, he immediately alienated the right, which has grown stronger during this conflict that has raised Israelis' elemental fears about survival in the region.</p>
        <p>Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud Party, issued a statement saying: ''I view gravely Barak's consent to continue the Camp David process as if nothing has happened. I see no point continuing the negotiations over the establishment of an emergency government.''</p>
        <p>Today's agreement was not celebrated in Sharm el Sheik, merely presented in a tense, somber ceremony presided over by President Clinton and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. American and Egyptian officials issued great sighs of relief that they had averted failure, which could have worsened the conflict. But Mr. Mubarak acknowledged that the agreement would disappoint many.</p>
        <p>''The outcome we have reached in this summit may not meet the expectations of all peoples,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians were particularly disappointed that an international inquiry into the recent violence was not mandated. Originally, Mr. Arafat set that as a precondition for attending the talks. But Mr. Mubarak and  Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations persuaded him to present the issue at the talks instead.</p>
        <p>The Israelis oppose such an inquiry, which one official said would turn into a ''kangaroo court.''</p>
        <p>The Palestinians agreed to a modification of what they wanted: an American-led fact-finding committee that will work in consultation with Mr. Annan. Its conclusions would ultimately be published as a report of the American president.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the talks, the Israelis withdrew their demand that the Palestinians act first, restraining the violence before they pulled back their troops. They agreed that both sides would take steps to curtail the violence simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Inside the Jolie Ville Golf Resort, the talks were businesslike at their best and vituperative at their worst. Emotions ran high.</p>
        <p>''It's worth noting that in any negotiations, you have to let the sides ventilate,'' a senior American official said. ''If you try to suppress that, you delay the point where they get into serious issues. I think it's safe to say that they did vent, but at the same time laid the basis'' for the agreement.</p>
        <p>The official said that after that venting, the conflicted mood of the day turned into a period of productivity in the wee hours of this morning.</p>
        <p>Between 12:30 and 4 a.m., President Clinton met with Mr. Mubarak and Mr. Arafat and then with Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>From his arrival here on Monday morning, President Clinton took a 4-hour break in a 28-hour period, holding more than 20 meetings back to back. In addition to Mr. Mubarak and Mr. Annan, the other foreign leaders who participated were King Abdullah of Jordan and Javier Solana, the foreign affairs director for the European Union.</p>
        <p>The agreement to rearrest the fundamentalists was not explicitly stated today. But Israeli and Palestinian officials confirmed it, and the Americans acknowledged that it was implicit in the goal of returning the situation on the ground to the way things were before the recent troubles began</p>
        <p>That goal, Israeli and Palestinian officials both said, was nearly impossible. It will take a very long time to repair the damage, they said, and things will never be the way they were before the violence erupted, the death toll mounted, the Israeli soldiers were killed by a mob and Ramallah and Gaza were shelled.</p>
        <p>''A great, big black hole opened up,'' another American official said. ''And if the parties end up back at the negotiating tables after that, then I will truly believe that the peace process has become irreversible.''</p>
