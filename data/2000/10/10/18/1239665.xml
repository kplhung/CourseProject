        <p>Good fruit deserves a little pampering. Once the blossoms fall off the Asian pear trees at Umpqua Organic Farm in Roseburg, Ore., each tiny budding fruit is enclosed in a two-ply paper bag imported from China. The bags keep the skin tender and uniform in color and prevent insect damage as the fruit matures on the tree. The pears are picked at their peak, then nestled in boxes with form-fitting foam liners for shipping.</p>

        <p>Good fruit deserves a little pampering. Once the blossoms fall off the Asian pear trees at Umpqua Organic Farm in Roseburg, Ore., each tiny budding fruit is enclosed in a two-ply paper bag imported from China. The bags keep the skin tender and uniform in color and prevent insect damage as the fruit matures on the tree. The pears are picked at their peak, then nestled in boxes with form-fitting foam liners for shipping.</p>
        <p>The special care is worth it. Unlike Asian pears in produce markets, which often have dry flesh, Umpqua's drip sweet nectar when cut. Of the more than 100 kinds of Asian pears, the farm grows four: Shinseiki, Shinko, 20th Century and Large Korean. They're sold from October through December in boxes of nine and are $21.95 plus shipping for seven pounds, or $19.95 plus shipping for five pounds of smaller pears. Not every variety is always available. To order: (541) 673-3223, or www.asianpearsorganic.com.</p>
