        <p>Symphony Hall, home of the Boston Pops as well as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has, over its 100 years, been many things to many people. In that respect, the concerts celebrating the hall's centenary on Saturday and Sunday surely covered the ground.</p>
        <p>Yoshikazu Fujimoto got the gala concert on Saturday evening off to a thunderous start on his giant Japanese drum. And the first third of the concert carried on without orchestra, as Yo-Yo Ma played two movements of an unaccompanied Bach cello suite, the jazz pianist Cyrus Chestnut played Rodgers and Hart's ''Lover,'' and the Boys Choir of Harlem performed with and without the singer James Taylor.</p>

        <p>Symphony Hall, home of the Boston Pops as well as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has, over its 100 years, been many things to many people. In that respect, the concerts celebrating the hall's centenary on Saturday and Sunday surely covered the ground.</p>
        <p>Yoshikazu Fujimoto got the gala concert on Saturday evening off to a thunderous start on his giant Japanese drum. And the first third of the concert carried on without orchestra, as Yo-Yo Ma played two movements of an unaccompanied Bach cello suite, the jazz pianist Cyrus Chestnut played Rodgers and Hart's ''Lover,'' and the Boys Choir of Harlem performed with and without the singer James Taylor.</p>
        <p>Then came the Boston Pops (basically the Boston Symphony without principal players), conducted by John Williams with and without the Irish band the Chieftains, and by Keith Lockhart with and without the actor and singer Mandy Patinkin.</p>
        <p>Even the Boston Symphony, conducted in its turn by Seiji Ozawa, played mostly material that would have been at home in a Pops concert: ''Remembrances'' from Mr. Williams's music for ''Schindler's List,'' with Gil Shaham as violin soloist; ''Make Our Garden Grow,'' from Bernstein's ''Candide,'' with Cynthia Haymon, Gregory Turay and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus; and ''La Valse'' by Ravel.</p>
        <p>The orchestra's lone concession to the hard-core classical repertory was the Kyrie from Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, the work performed at the first concert in Symphony Hall, on Oct. 15, 1900, and again two weeks ago to start this anniversary season.</p>
        <p>By now, you had to wonder what Henry Lee Higginson, who built the hall and who founded the Boston Symphony in 1881, would have made of all this. ''I always like the severe in architecture, music, men and women, books, &amp;c. &amp;c.,'' Higginson wrote to the hall's architect, Charles Follen McKim, in a letter included in Richard Poate Stebbins's ''Making of Symphony Hall,'' one of two books published for the anniversary.</p>
        <p>True, Higginson also founded the orchestra's Pops concerts in 1885, a time when serious music was revered, and even entertainment was taken seriously. (The book draws its epigraph from Seneca: ''Believe me, true joy is a serious matter.'') Higginson left no doubt, in any case, which was the dog and which the tail.</p>
        <p>So on to Sunday afternoon and a free concert kicking off a daylong open house at the hall. Mr. Lockhart conducted the Pops in Shostakovich's ''Festive Overture,'' dances from Bernstein's ''West Side Story'' and music of Elvis Presley; Mr. Williams led it in music of his own, including excerpts from the film score for ''J. F. K.'' By now, after so much fragmented programming, a listener could almost appreciate the gushy tone of surprise with which the television personalities acting as hosts announced that Mr. Ozawa and the Boston Symphony would play the entire Fifth Symphony of Beethoven.</p>
        <p>Like the variety, however disproportionate, the cautious choice of Beethoven is also reflected in the hall's history, indeed in its very stone, in one of the hall's lovable quirks. The name Beethoven appears in relief in a central medallion above the stage; surrounding medallions were left blank, because the directors could not agree on any other name.</p>
        <p>Those idealists could have used a touch of practicality, learned, perhaps, from the resourceful citizens of Amsterdam. Using paint instead of stone relief to cite composers in the Concertgebouw, the Dutch had merely to paint over Gounod's name with Richard Strauss's when Strauss showed up to conduct a century ago. (Gounod was restored later, when a second row of names was added.)</p>
        <p>But what everyone loves most about Symphony Hall is its acoustics, rivaled by those of the Concertgebouw, the Musikverein in Vienna and Carnegie Hall, but by few others. Its acoustician, Wallace Clement Sabine, was one of the founders of modern acoustical science, imprecise as it long remained.</p>
        <p>And those acoustics were utterly falsified in these concerts, even more by huge installations of theatrical and television lighting than by occasional miking. The lights, and whatever may have been used to cool them, produced all manner of antimusical whines and whooshes.</p>
        <p>Most affected, predictably, was the strictly classical fare, especially Mr. Ma's work, in which pianissimos that might have proved breathtaking by themselves came saddled with extraneous noise.</p>
        <p>In this respect the occasion was reduced to a celebration in principle. And not all the popsy tunes ever written can breathe life into that kind of thing.</p>
