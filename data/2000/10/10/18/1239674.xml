        <p>The difference between traditional Broadway singing and its contemporary theatrical incarnation has rarely been delineated more sharply than it was on Monday evening at City Center, where a multigenerational gathering of stars performed ''My Favorite Broadway: The Love Songs.'' The glittering, swiftly paced variety show, taped for ''Great Performances'' on PBS, featured songs by everyone from George Gershwin to Jonathan Larson. Its top-of-the-line production values included an orchestra conducted by Paul Gemignani playing arrangements by the likes of  Don Sebesky and Peter Matz.</p>
        <p>Leading the old guard was Julie Andrews, the evening's host, who dropped enough tantalizing tidbits about the creation of ''My Fair Lady'' to make you wish she would reminisce at greater length. Ms. Andrews rarely sings these days. But when Robert Goulet, her co-star in ''Camelot,'' serenaded her with ''If Ever I Would Leave You,'' and later when Michael Crawford (as Henry Higgins) coaxed her into singing a couple of phrases from ''The Rain in Spain,'' the audience went wild.</p>

        <p>The difference between traditional Broadway singing and its contemporary theatrical incarnation has rarely been delineated more sharply than it was on Monday evening at City Center, where a multigenerational gathering of stars performed ''My Favorite Broadway: The Love Songs.'' The glittering, swiftly paced variety show, taped for ''Great Performances'' on PBS, featured songs by everyone from George Gershwin to Jonathan Larson. Its top-of-the-line production values included an orchestra conducted by Paul Gemignani playing arrangements by the likes of  Don Sebesky and Peter Matz.</p>
        <p>Leading the old guard was Julie Andrews, the evening's host, who dropped enough tantalizing tidbits about the creation of ''My Fair Lady'' to make you wish she would reminisce at greater length. Ms. Andrews rarely sings these days. But when Robert Goulet, her co-star in ''Camelot,'' serenaded her with ''If Ever I Would Leave You,'' and later when Michael Crawford (as Henry Higgins) coaxed her into singing a couple of phrases from ''The Rain in Spain,'' the audience went wild.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Andrews, Mr. Goulet (in robust voice) and Chita Rivera (remarkably limber vocally and physically) embodied tradition, the evening was essentially a showcase for today's younger Broadway stars who reached maturity in the rock era, when stage singing became amplified. What quickly became apparent was how the microphone, with its emphasis on the treble, tends to homogenize even the most distinctive voices. That's one reason that the manufacture of a large, aggressive vocal sound has superseded quirky personality as a Broadway ideal.</p>
        <p>It would be useless at this late date to lament the technological revolution that has institutionalized exhibitionistic belting. It's a fait accompli. And in varying degrees the younger singers who dominated the evening upheld the new value system. Performers like Linda Eder and Adam Pascal, who combine formidable vocal power with flamboyant histrionics that aspire to VH1 ideals of a diva and of rock showmanship, now rule Broadway.</p>
        <p>Performing a medley of ''Come Rain or Come Shine,'' ''I Don't Know How to Love Him'' and ''What Kind of Fool Am I?,'' Ms. Eder unfurled a machine-tooled sob that suggested a technically flawless hybrid of Celine Dion and the mature Barbra Streisand. If nothing else, her stamina and ability to keep dynamically topping herself within the same song demonstrated an awesome prowess.</p>
        <p>Singing ''Elaborate Lives'' from ''Aida,'' Mr. Pascal filtered Anthony Newley through David Bowie through Dennis DeYoung (of Styx). At the same time his hyper-dramatic vocalizing echoed the braying sob of Mr. Crawford, who delivered ''Music of the Night,'' his signature song from ''Phantom of the Opera,'' with his usual majestic creepiness.</p>
        <p>Although more traditional in style, Rebecca Luker (''Till There Was You,'' ''Too Late Now''), Marin Mazzie (''So In Love,'' ''Not a Day Goes By'') and Ron Raines (''Gigi'') also reflected the new sock-it-out ethos. Introspection and interpretive subtlety were subsumed to volume and technical polish.</p>
