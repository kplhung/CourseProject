        <p>There were moments when they shined, such as when Allan Houston powered through the lane and a cluster of defenders for a resounding dunk, or when Latrell Sprewell fed Glen Rice for an open 3-pointer.</p>
        <p>But such highlights were rare when the Knicks played their three star swingmen together in a preseason game against the Washington Wizards on Monday night. More common was a Knick turnover or the sight of the Washington point guard, Rod Strickland, doing what he wanted on the offensive end.</p>
        <p>Without question, the Knicks' second experiment with Houston, Sprewell and Rice playing together was worse than the unit's mediocre debut last Thursday against the Philadelphia 76ers. Before Marcus Camby, Kurt Thomas and the second-string guards led the Knicks to a 95-90 victory over Washington, the lineup featuring the big backcourt had four turnovers and was outscored, 18-9, over six and a half minutes in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>''In order to be successful at it, we have to practice it somewhat,'' Sprewell said today, explaining the group's poor performance. ''And now's probably the best time to get that in.''</p>
        <p>That's true, but circumstance and injury have kept the Knicks from spending much practice time on their big backcourt. Houston sat out the first three days of practice while recuperating from the Olympics, then sprained his left ankle and missed the preseason opener.</p>
        <p>Against Philadelphia last week, the threesome played together for less than four minutes before Sprewell tweaked his left ankle and went to the bench for the rest of the game. And Monday, Rice strained his left knee in the third quarter. He missed the rest of the game and was kept out of practice today. Whether he plays Wednesday against the Milwaukee Bucks at Madison Square Garden will be a game-time decision.</p>
        <p>''We can never seem to get to it in practice,'' Van Gundy said.</p>
        <p>Sprewell, who moves from small forward to point guard in the alignment, has the greatest adjustment and needs the most work. So far, opponents have clamped down on the Knicks with fullcourt pressure when Sprewell runs the point, making it difficult for him to get the ball upcourt and the Knicks into their offense. Philadelphia's Speedy Claxton and Allen Iverson hounded him last Thursday, and Strickland bothered him Monday.</p>
        <p>''For me, it's just ball handling and getting used to the pressure,'' said Sprewell, who has 3 turnovers in 10 minutes at point guard this preseason. ''It's very tough, especially for somebody who hasn't done it in seven or eight years. It's different when you're in the halfcourt and you only have to go left for two dribbles as opposed to 90 feet, 80 feet or whatever. It's a big difference.''</p>
        <p>To ease the pressure on Sprewell, who had some experience at point guard while playing at Golden State, Van Gundy plans to have Larry Johnson and Marcus Camby bring the ball up the floor sometimes. While they are merely decent ball handlers, the large opponents guarding them will not be able to pressure them all the way upcourt as point guards can do to Sprewell.</p>
        <p>But offense is not the only matter concerning Van Gundy. Sprewell, Houston and Rice have also failed to impress on defense. Strickland had a field day for the Wizards, scoring 5 points and dishing out 4 assists in his six minutes against the big backcourt, prompting Van Gundy to call that unit's defense awful.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' swingmen brushed off their sluggish performance as an aberration, and for Sprewell, at least, it probably was. But Houston and Rice are average defenders at best, not the gritty stoppers whom Van Gundy favors.</p>
        <p>Another obstacle facing the big backcourt is the solid play of the Knicks' more traditional point guards, Charlie Ward and Chris Childs. ''Our point guards have been our best players so far,'' Van Gundy said. ''I like them very much.''</p>
        <p>Ward was aggressive attacking the basket for layups and the glass for rebounds in the first two games; and Childs was stellar against Washington, posting 9 points, 8 assists and 3 steals while directing the Knicks' offense. And though he is often out of control, Erick Strickland brings toughness and tenacity.</p>
