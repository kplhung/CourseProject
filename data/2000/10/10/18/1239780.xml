        <p>A father, apparently enraged by a fight with his estranged wife over when he could visit his 3-month-old son, threw the infant from the window of her 15th-floor apartment in Co-op City yesterday, killing the boy instantly, the police said.</p>
        <p>The baby, wearing just a diaper and a T-shirt, landed face up in a grassy courtyard in front of the building at 140 Debs Place in the Bronx. The boy, Kharel C. Slade, was pronounced dead at 2:45 a.m., the police said. The police said the killing took place just as officers were arriving at the apartment.</p>
        <p>At an arraignment last night before Judge John A. Barone of Criminal Court, the child's father, Derek Slade, 30, was ordered held without bail on charges of second-degree murder, first-degree manslaughter and second-degree criminal contempt. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, said a spokeswoman for the Bronx district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>Friends and neighbors said the Slades' three-year marriage had been troubled from the start. Since 1997, the year Derek Slade married Kerri Flowers, the police had been summoned eight times because of the couple's fighting.</p>
        <p>In late August, the police responded to Mrs. Slade's home three times in three days, officials said, including  one instance in which she reported that Mr. Slade had left with the baby, who needed to be near his mother because he was breast-fed and suffered from a heart murmur.</p>
        <p>Court records detailed a number of disputes between the Slades, including Mr. Slade's conviction on second-degree harassment charges in September 1997. Since then, Mrs. Slade had obtained two temporary orders of protection against him. Last month, she had initiated a custody and child support case. In that case, a family court judge ruled that Mr. Slade could not be in Mrs. Slade's home or harass, threaten or assault her, and that his rights to visit the baby were to be limited.</p>
        <p>Early yesterday, the Slades were arguing loudly inside her apartment after Mr. Slade had entered with a key, the police and neighbors said. Mrs. Slade called the police.</p>
        <p>When officers arrived at 2:26 a.m., they spoke briefly with Mrs. Slade, who showed them the order of protection. They arrested and handcuffed Mr. Slade, who had been in the rear bedroom. Mrs. Slade then went into the bedroom and discovered that Kharel's blanket was empty and the window was open.</p>
        <p>One of Mrs. Slade's neighbors, Calvin Cuttino, said that the mother later recounted desperately searching the bedsheets and the closet.</p>
        <p>Two officers and a sergeant raced downstairs, where they found the baby. Yesterday afternoon, neighbors placed candles and bouquets of flowers in the courtyard.</p>
        <p>Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city's chief medical examiner, said the baby died from blunt trauma to the head. Mrs. Slade was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, and later released, a hospital spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>Ken Jones, 29, said he could hear yelling and cursing in the Slade apartment at 2 a.m., while he was smoking a cigarette on the terrace of his eighth-floor apartment.</p>
        <p>He said he had attended high school with Mrs. Slade. ''She was talking about that baby like it was her world,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuttino's daughter, Jennifer Cuttino, a childhood friend of Mrs. Slade's, described the marriage as a volatile one that the new mother nonetheless wanted to save. The Slades had known each other for about 20 years, she said.</p>
        <p>''She tried and tried to be a family, and she thought that the baby would finally make them a family,'' Ms. Cuttino said. ''He said he wanted a child and he acted like he wanted a child, but he didn't. You can't be a family by killing your baby.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cuttino said Mr. Slade sometimes visited his wife's apartment to deliver cash or supplies, despite the order of protection. ''What would you expect her to say?'' she said. ''She wasn't doing all that well financially.'' Friends said Mrs. Slade worked for a temporary agency, while Mr. Slade had a manufacturing job.</p>
        <p>Records indicated that Mr. Slade lived with his father at 2420 Hunter Avenue in Co-op City, but the apartment appeared empty yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cuttino said the father was jealous of his wife's affection for their infant. ''She didn't want to be with him anymore,'' she said, ''and he knew the only way he could hurt her would be through the baby. And he did. He crushed her.''</p>
