        <p>Al Leiter and Dennis Cook are poised for their second World Series wild-card experience, but their former Florida teammate Edgar Renteria can be more objective about what the Mets face.</p>
        <p>''The Mets are playing good ball right now,'' said Renteria, whose 11th-inning run-scoring single delivered the 1997 World Series championship to the Marlins, the first and, until now, only wild-card team to reach the World Series. ''When you go to the playoffs, it does not matter if you're the wild card or win the division. They're playing good now. Nobody's better now. They beat us in the playoffs. They played great ball. The wild card will mean nothing. Only when they play on the field, that's all that matters.''</p>

        <p>Al Leiter and Dennis Cook are poised for their second World Series wild-card experience, but their former Florida teammate Edgar Renteria can be more objective about what the Mets face.</p>
        <p>''The Mets are playing good ball right now,'' said Renteria, whose 11th-inning run-scoring single delivered the 1997 World Series championship to the Marlins, the first and, until now, only wild-card team to reach the World Series. ''When you go to the playoffs, it does not matter if you're the wild card or win the division. They're playing good now. Nobody's better now. They beat us in the playoffs. They played great ball. The wild card will mean nothing. Only when they play on the field, that's all that matters.''</p>
        <p>Renteria was left to assess the Mets' chances in the World Series after they finished off the team he plays for, the St. Louis Cardinals, in five National League Championship Series games. As he walked through the bowels of Shea Stadium toward the team bus early yesterday morning, Renteria was asked to think back three years and recall what the key element for the Marlins was in winning that World Series.</p>
        <p>''Like these guys are doing now,'' he said. ''When you see this team, you see everybody together. They got confidence. When we won the World Series in '97, we felt the same thing. They're playing very good. They got a chance to win the World Series.''</p>
        <p>The Mets have certainly played as if they could beat anybody in the World Series. They dispatched the Cardinals as easily as they sent the San Francisco Giants home unexpectedly.</p>
        <p>What makes the Mets' conquest of the Cardinals all the more impressive was that it occurred immediately after the Cardinals vanquished the Atlanta Braves in three quick and easy steps. The Mets didn't show much gratitude for the favor the Cardinals did them, knocking out the Braves so the Mets wouldn't have to play them, but no such camaraderie exists in baseball.</p>
        <p>Pitching and defense seemed to be the primary reasons for the difference in the outcome of the Cardinals' two series. The Cardinals were able to hit the Braves' best starters freely but were shut down for the most part by the Mets' best starters.</p>
        <p>The Mets' best starters are left-handed, which helped explain the Cardinals' problems. During the season, the Cardinals batted .276 against right-handed pitchers and .255 against left-handers. They also had a better rate of home runs and runs batted in against right-handers.</p>
        <p>None of that explains why the Cardinals battered the Braves left-hander Tom Glavine for seven runs, knocking him out of Game 2 in the third inning. They ganged up on Glavine two days after bringing an early end to a start by the right-hander Greg Maddux, scoring seven runs (five earned) against him in four innings.</p>
        <p>But the Cardinals couldn't do a thing with the Mets left-hander Mike Hampton, failing to score a run against him in 16 innings over two games. They scored three runs in seven innings against Leiter, also left-handed, but they lost that game, too.</p>
        <p>Defensively, the Braves committed five errors, spreading them over all three games. Their first-game errors were especially harmful.</p>
        <p>The Mets made three errors in their first game, too, but they won the game and then made only one more error in the last four games. The Cardinals, meanwhile, committed only one error against the Braves but made seven against the Mets.</p>
        <p>Some St. Louis apologists lamented the pitching problems the Cardinals encountered in the series with the Mets, but Tony La Russa, their manager, dismissed that idea as irrelevant.</p>
        <p>''We had the exact same circumstances against the Braves,'' La Russa said.</p>
        <p>Garrett Stephenson wasn't able to pitch against the Mets, the manager pointed out, because he had been hurt early in the game he pitched against the Braves. Rick Ankiel was wild against the Braves, and he was wild against the Mets.</p>
        <p>The Mets had no pitching problems, other than giving up some runs at inopportune times.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the Mets' victory over the Cardinals, some scouts speculated on the effect Hampton and Leiter could have on the Yankees, who, like the Cardinals, supposedly don't fare as well against left-handers as against right-handers.</p>
        <p>''Leiter and Hampton are going to give any club trouble,'' one National League scout said. ''The thing the Yankees will have to worry about is these two left-handers. They really come at you, two nights in a row, and they can beat anybody.''</p>
        <p>As accurate as the left-handed theory might have been -- some teams used to bring up young left-handed pitchers from the minor leagues to pitch against the Yankees -- it hasn't been a sound strategy this season.</p>
        <p>This season the Yankees have actually fared better statistically against left-handers than right-handers. Their batting average was 19 points better (.291 to .272) against left-handers. David Justice, Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill, the lineup's left-handed hitters, have hit better against left-handers than right-handers this season.</p>
        <p>That's not to say that Leiter and Hampton would not be able to beat the Yankees, but it would probably not be as easy as it was to beat the Cardinals.</p>
