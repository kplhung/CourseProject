        <p>As rescue workers and federal officials searched a remote wooded area today for wreckage of a twin-engine plane that carried Gov. Mel Carnahan, his son and a campaign adviser, an investigator said the pilot had reported an instrument problem moments before the plane crashed on Monday night.</p>
        <p>The governor's son, Roger Carnahan, 44, who was flying the plane, reported experiencing trouble with the ''gyro,'' said an official close to the investigation who asked that no name be used.</p>
        <p>Pilots rely on several gyroscopes and gyrocompasses to read a plane's heading and orientation, and it was unclear which gyro was being referred to, the official said. The instruments become even more important in rain and clouds, the conditions on Monday night. Under those conditions, pilots can become disoriented and think a gyroscope's warning of danger is inaccurate.</p>
        <p>It could take months for the cause of the crash to become clearer, though.</p>
        <p>But Robert Bartlett, manager of St. Louis Downtown Parks Airport, in Cahokia, Ill., where the plane took off at 7 p.m., said, ''There was no unusually unsafe weather or even unusual weather'' for flying on Monday night. In fact, Mr. Bartlett said that several planes arrived and departed within 10 minutes of the governor's plane taking off.</p>
        <p>''They had no problems,'' Mr. Bartlett said, referring to other planes. ''We had arrivals and departures until we closed at 9 p.m.''</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service in St. Louis said that visibility at the time of the crash was three miles and that the area was having ''moderate to heavy rain,'' although apparently there was no lightning.</p>
        <p>''Our lightning sensors did not detect a lightning strike within 100 miles of the crash,'' said Dale Bechtold, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said.</p>
        <p>Many mourners and well-wishers gathered outside the Governor's Mansion in Jefferson City, where they placed hundreds of flowers, small presents and cards. Many state employees had begun wearing black lapel pins to remember the three men who died.</p>
        <p>Jerry Nachtigal, the governor's press secretary, said this afternoon that the 45 to 50 employees who worked with Mr. Carnahan, 66, were ''devastated.''</p>
        <p>''It didn't matter if it was a cabinet official or a courier, in this office Governor Carnahan always had a kind word,'' Mr. Nachtigal said. ''He knew that person's first name and probably knew all his or her children as well. We were all very fond of Governor Carnahan.''</p>
        <p>The governor had been expected at a campaign rally at 8 Monday night in New Madrid, about 150 miles south of St. Louis. The twin-engine plane, a 1980 Cessna 335, disappeared from radar at 7:33 Monday night, said Elizabeth Isham Cory, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. It crashed in an unincorporated area about five miles north of Hillsboro, the Jefferson County seat.</p>
        <p>Captain Ed Kemp of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said that witnesses reported hearing  ''what sounded like an engine revving up in a dive, then they heard an explosion and saw a ball of fire.''</p>
        <p>Also killed in the crash was Chris Sifford, 37, an adviser to Governor Carnahan in his race to unseat Senator John Ashcroft, a Republican.</p>
        <p>The plane was registered to Roger Carnahan's law firm, Carnahan Hickle &amp; Calvert in Rolla, Mo., officials said. Ms. Cory said the younger Mr. Carnahan was an instrument-rated pilot who was licensed on July 31, 1988. Records show that neither Mr. Carnahan nor the plane had been previously involved in accidents.</p>
        <p>''His record and the plane's record were clean,'' Ms. Cory said. ''No accidents no incidents, no service difficulty reports on the airplane.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carnahan's law partner, William Hickle, said that Mr. Carnahan had more than 1,600 hours of flying experience and that he had a basic rating as well as an instrument and a commercial rating and was certified to fly twin-engine airplanes.</p>
        <p>Today's search was made more difficult by what officials described as ''hilly, rough terrain.''</p>
        <p>Carol Carmody, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, said the agency's ''first priority is to identify the remains.''</p>
        <p>Governor Carnahan's plane crash  revived memories of a similar plane crash involving another popular Missouri Democrat 24 years ago.</p>
        <p>It was an August election night in 1976. Jerry Litton, a two-term congressman from Chillicothe, was winning the Democratic primary for  United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Shortly after taking off from Chillicothe for a short flight to Kansas City, the plane crashed into a field and burned. Mr. Litton, his wife, Sharon, their two children, the pilot and the pilot's son died.</p>
        <p>John C. Danforth, a Republican who at the time was Missouri's attorney general, won the election and remained in the Senate for 18 years.</p>
        <p>Pilot error and a problem with the crankshaft in the plane's left engine were blamed for the Litton crash.</p>
        <p>Across the state tonight, residents expressed shock over the death of Governor Carnahan. Hardest hit by the news of the crash were the governor's supporters and staff.</p>
        <p>''We're just stunned and saddened almost beyond belief,'' said Mr.  Hickle, Mr. Carnahan's law partner. ''These were just two very fine men, both father and son. And it's just hard to lose them in such a tragic manner. We love them both very much.''</p>
