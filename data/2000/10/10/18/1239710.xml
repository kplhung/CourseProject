        <p>Cardinal Pietro Palazzini, a retired Vatican official who was honored by Israel for rescuing an Italian Jew in the Holocaust, died in Rome last Wednesday. He was 88.</p>
        <p>Pope John Paul II delivered the eulogy on Friday at Cardinal Palazzini's funeral at St. Peter's, recalling his role in helping prepare the Second Vatican Council in 1962, as well as his work in the 1980's, when he headed the Vatican office that investigates candidates for sainthood.</p>
        <p>''After having read and studied so many biographies of the beatified and canonized, our revered brother is now called to enter their abode through the door of the just,'' the pope said.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Palazzini, who was ordained in 1934 and began his career teaching moral theology and canon law in Rome, became a cardinal in 1973. He was remembered in Israel for his effort to help Italian Jews during World War II. According to Mordecai Paldiel, director of the department of the Righteous Among Nations at Vad Yashem, Israel's Holocaust Memorial, Cardinal Palazzini hid an Italian Jew, Michael Tagliacozzo, on Vatican property for many months in 1943 and 1944, when Nazis and Italian fascists were rounding up Italian Jews. At the time, he was an assistant vice rector of a pontifical seminary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tagliacozzo now lives in a kibbutz in Israel. In 1985, Yad Vashem recognized Cardinal Palazzini as a righteous gentile, one of those who risked their lives to help Jews in the war, and his name was engraved on the Yad Vashem Wall of Honor.</p>
