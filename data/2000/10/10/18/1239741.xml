        <p>Next Time, Try the Door</p>
        <p>Clark Kent figured out the flying thing better than BRETT DE LA MARE did -- Mr. De La Mare proved the other day that Superman he is not.  Now Mr. De La Mare is trying to prolong his 15 minutes of fame, appearing on radio talk shows and calling reporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. De La Mare says he is a 36-year-old writer from Australia who is desperate to sell his action-adventure manuscript to a publisher.  But he says he is caught in a Catch-22: ''Publishers won't talk to you unless you've got an agent, and agents don't want to talk to you unless you've been published. No wonder there are so many awful books out there. They make it so hard for a new writer to get his foot in the door.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. De La Mare got his foot into was a garbage bin at the police station in Central Park, and all because he decided that the way to attract the attention of the publishing world was to go up, up and away.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, Mr. De La Mare strapped on a paraglider and some sort of sign, then flew from Liberty State Park in Jersey City to Manhattan. He said that he circled the Empire State Building before heading north, toward Central Park.</p>
        <p>''As I was flying over the Jackie Onassis reservoir, the motor cuts out,'' he said. ''I tried my best to make it to the Great Lawn but I could see I wasn't going to make it.  I thought I would crash into these trees. There were police helicopters circling. Beyond the trees there was a car park and a row of garbage bins with wheels on them. I come in at 20 miles an hour.''</p>
        <p>He was immediately surrounded by police officers who told him that he had landed in the station house parking lot and arrested him for reckless endangerment.  A police spokesman confirmed the charge and other details of his account.</p>
        <p>All that, he said yesterday, and still no one had offered to read his novel.</p>
        <p>A Moment of Zen, New York Style</p>
        <p>This is the story of one Monday-night screening and two Jameses -- JAMES GRAY, the director of the new film ''The Yards,'' about crime and corruption and subways, and the actor JAMES CAAN, who plays Uncle Frank in Mr. Gray's movie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray looked as if he would rather have been anywhere else than at the screening, at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel, at 2 Avenue of the Americas. Mr. Gray is a tall, thin man with glasses that give him a perpetually quizzical look, as in ''What am I doing here?''</p>
        <p>He seemed stuck at the door of the screening room, which was filled with actors, Miramax executives and reporters, until Mr. Caan took his arm and said, ''James, com'ere, I gotta talk to you.'' Then Mr. Caan walked him to a far corner.</p>
        <p>So what did Mr. Mr. Caan say that got Mr. Gray inside?</p>
        <p>''He's a worrywart,'' Mr. Caan said. ''I assured him the film was great and he had nothing to fear.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray's account was different. ''What he actually said,'' he said -- and here Mr. Gray did an excellent imitation of James Caan as a tough guy -- ''was, 'Whaddya gettin' so hysterical for? It's gonna be O.K.''</p>
        <p>Classics With Reverb</p>
        <p>PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the actor FRITZ WEAVER gave a reading of mostly Latin classics in translation at the museum on Sunday. But their post-performance review was in the original English.</p>
        <p>The idea was to read literature that was roughly contemporary with the art in the museum's exhibit ''The Year One.''</p>
        <p>But they had to contend with the booming sound in the barrel-vaulted, statue-filled gallery in which they appeared. ''Too much reverberation,'' Mr. Weaver said after the reading, despite the prolonged efforts of audio engineers beforehand. ''Could you hear me?''</p>
        <p>Then there was the program. ''Catullus,'' Mr. de Montebello said, announcing the Roman lyric poet who lived in the first century B.C.  ''With one t and two l's. Not two t's and one l, as in your programs.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Weaver's Virgil was a fiery melodramatist, Mr. de Montebello's was more in the reflective mode. And his Catullus was spelled correctly. ''One t, two l's,'' he said again after the reading, as he handed back a program a listener had dropped.</p>
