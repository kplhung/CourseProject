        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>VATICAN: QUEEN AND POPE MEET -- The temporal head of the Church of England and the leader of the Roman Catholic Church discussed Christian unity and the Northern Ireland situation in a 20-minute audience at the Vatican. Queen Elizabeth II, on her first state visit to Italy since 1980, met with John Paul II. In deference to Vatican protocol, the queen traded her customary pastels for somber black.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: 3 HELD IN OMAGH BLAST -- Three men were arrested in connection with the 1998 Omagh bombing, which killed 29 people and wounded 300. The three, who can be held in custody without charge for 72 hours, are among four people identified in a British television documentary as being involved in the attack. The Real I.R.A., a splinter group, took responsibility for the blast.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: CARLOS ASSOCIATE ON TRIAL -- Hans-Joachim Klein, 52, an associate of the jailed international terrorist known as Carlos, went on trial in Frankfurt accused of the killing three people and the attempted murder of three others when the gang seized 70 hostages, including 11 ministers, in an attack on an OPEC meeting in Vienna in 1975.</p>
        <p>Victor Homola (NYT)</p>
        <p>ENGLAND: ENIGMA RANSOM PAID -- A wartime German code machine stolen from a British museum at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, has been partly recovered after museum officials agreed to pay a ransom of some $36,000, the museum reported. The machine, whose capture enabled British cryptographers to crack the Nazi Enigma code, was sent to Jeremy Paxman, a BBC television presenter, but a museum spokeswoman said its coding wheels, its most valuable part, were missing.</p>
        <p>Alan Cowell (NYT)</p>
        <p>NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL DELAY -- The Lockerbie trial was delayed for at least another week to let prosecutors investigate new information from two unidentified countries in the trial of two Libyans accused in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Nearly 12 years after the blast, the Scottish prosecutors said new information came to light that may have ''material bearing'' on the defense.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>NIGERIA: 100 SAID TO DIE IN ETHNIC CLASHES -- Renewed clashes between a Yoruba group and Hausa merchants are reported to have led to more than 100 deaths, most of them in Lagos. The two days of ethnic conflicts have been led by the Odua People's Congress, a group that wants autonomy for the Yoruba, who make up one of the country's three main ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>Norimitsu Onishi (NYT)</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE: ANTI-MUGABE PROTESTS -- Angered by the soaring prices of food, demonstrators in poor townships around the capital, Harare, threw stones, blocked streets and clashed with the police. The leading opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, has warned that frustration with the government of President Robert Mugabe is mounting. In the next two weeks the party plans to announce the timing and tactics of a protest campaign to force Mr. Mugabe to step down.</p>
        <p>Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)</p>
        <p>UGANDA: W.H.O. ACTS IN EBOLA OUTBREAK -- The World Health Organization has sent two epidemiologists and a laboratory specialist with a shipment of protective clothing for health care workers in the Gulu district of Uganda to help contain a deadly outbreak of ebola hemorrhagic fever. The 81 cases diagnosed in Gulu now include two nurses who contracted the disease before its presence was confirmed, and 35 Ugandans have already died.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAQ: MORE AID FLIGHTS -- Flights from Bahrain and Egypt landed in Baghdad, in defiance of United Nations sanctions against Iraq, the Iraqi state news agency reported. The Bahrain plane was said to carry about 70 people, food and medical supplies. An Egyptian Boeing 737 carried a medical team and about 100 doctors, businessmen, artists, intellectuals and journalists.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: NEW FOREIGN MINISTER -- In a cabinet shuffle, John Manley, left, a centrist lawyer from Ottawa, became Foreign Minister, replacing Lloyd Axworthy, a liberal who is retiring from parliamentary politics after nearly five years in the office. Brian Tobin, who just quit as Newfoundland's premier, took Mr. Manley's old cabinet post, as industry minister. Prime Minister Jean Chretien is believed to have brought the Newfoundlander into the cabinet as a way to build support in Atlantic Canada before an election expected for Nov. 27.</p>
        <p>James Brooke (NYT)</p>
        <p>CANADA: U.S. BILL PROTESTED -- Canada's government and American environmental groups have protested that a water bill that passed the United States Senate on Friday could allow for the transfer of exotic species and fish diseases from the Missouri River to the Red River, which flows into Canada's Hudson Bay watershed. The government protested in a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright that the Dakota Water Resources Act could cause irreversible ecological harm.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>INDIA: BANDIT FREES HOSTAGE -- The South Indian bandit Veerappan released one of his hostages, but insists that he will not free the movie idol Rajkumar -- held in the jungle for 11 weeks -- until 51 people accused of being accomplices are let out of jail. The freed hostage, S. A. Govindaraj, who is Rajkumar's son-in-law, said at a news conference that Veerappan ''knows the release of his allies has been blocked by the courts, but he is unrelenting.''</p>
