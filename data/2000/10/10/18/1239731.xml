        <p>A week ago, Coach Jim Fassel viewed the films from the Giants' victory over the Atlanta Falcons and admitted that what he saw scared him. This week, the films showed the Dallas Cowboys doing everything they could to self-destruct, yet the Giants could not nudge past them until the final minutes. Still, Fassel was smiling as he took a breath, counting his blessings as the Giants headed into their bye week with a 5-2 record.</p>
        <p>While there were plenty of frightening signs in nearly every one of the Giants' victories this season, Fassel saw reason for optimism, too. Part of it is simply the mediocre competition in the National Football League. But Fassel also saw positives, even in the negatives.</p>

        <p>A week ago, Coach Jim Fassel viewed the films from the Giants' victory over the Atlanta Falcons and admitted that what he saw scared him. This week, the films showed the Dallas Cowboys doing everything they could to self-destruct, yet the Giants could not nudge past them until the final minutes. Still, Fassel was smiling as he took a breath, counting his blessings as the Giants headed into their bye week with a 5-2 record.</p>
        <p>While there were plenty of frightening signs in nearly every one of the Giants' victories this season, Fassel saw reason for optimism, too. Part of it is simply the mediocre competition in the National Football League. But Fassel also saw positives, even in the negatives.</p>
        <p>Receiver Amani Toomer struggled badly enough to be benched during Sunday's 19-14 victory over the Cowboys, but Fassel saw that as an opportunity to highlight the team's depth by inserting Joe Jurevicius in Toomer's place. Cornerback Jason Sehorn was injured on the first play of the game, and Fassel saw a chance to show his faith in Emmanuel McDaniel.</p>
        <p>''I'm more positive than anything,'' Fassel said. ''Anybody that takes a win lightly in this league, there are a whole bunch of teams, I'm sure, that would trade places with us record-wise. We're 5-2 and we know that we need to make improvement. That's a lot better than being 2-5 and knowing you need to make improvement.</p>
        <p>''We're not asleep at the wheel. We're not walking around here saying that we're wonderful. We know we're 5-2 and that's good. We also know we have to get better. We have the right attitude that allows us to get better. The guys have stuck together and they've worked very hard. So it gives me belief that we can get better, and we'll go out and fight every game.''</p>
        <p>The answer to whether Fassel is misguided in his beliefs will come shortly after the team returns to action Oct. 29 against the Philadelphia Eagles, who sit one game behind the Giants and the Washington Redskins in the National Football Conference East.</p>
        <p>After a road game against the struggling Cleveland Browns, the Giants return home to host the St. Louis Rams, a team that even Fassel admits may not have an equal in the league.</p>
        <p>''Well, we'll find out eventually,'' Fassel said. ''Obviously, the Rams are unbelievable. Who's going to stop them? I don't know. But when we get to them, we'll figure out a way to try to beat them.</p>
        <p>''In this league right now, there are only a couple teams that are on a fast track and people are saying, 'How are you going to beat them?' And there are a couple of teams that everybody is looking at and saying, 'They're going to have a tough time beating anybody.' Everybody else is in the middle. Everybody else is right there.</p>
        <p>''It's who you're playing on every Sunday, and it's who is going to keep their head above water through that majority of the pack. It used to be there were 10 teams who were dominant and 10 that were down below and about 10 in the middle. Those middles could jump up once in a while, but those 10 were pretty solid. Now you've got two up, two down and 27 or 28 teams that are all stacked together. And that's where we are, with everybody else. We're the big majority, and we've just got to play better than the big majority and keep going and see if we can knock off those couple of teams that everybody says is better than everybody else.''</p>
        <p>Fassel, in his fourth season at the helm, has kept a tighter leash on his players. When Toomer, his top receiver, made mistakes on pass routes against the Cowboys, Fassel did not hesitate to insert Jurevicius, who has endured his own struggles with the team. And the moves that were dictated by injury did not deter Fassel's belief that the Giants could survive adversity.</p>
        <p>''One of the things about being successful, you're going to have some injuries,'' Fassel said. ''Hopefully, they're not long or permanent, but guys have to step up and go. People say to me, 'Can Joe Jurevicius step in and play for us?' Well, he had to and he did. Can Emmanuel McDaniel step in and play for us? I can't predict all those things, but those guys have to be ready.</p>
        <p>''We beat the Dallas Cowboys and saw some guys step up and make some plays. We played with a tremendous amount of intensity. It wasn't always perfect. We've still got room for improvement in a lot of things, but we played with a lot of heart and a lot of belief and it got us through it. Five and two. We'll take it.''</p>
