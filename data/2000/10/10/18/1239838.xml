        <p>The roller coaster ride that captured the Yankees this year and sent them careering hither and yon gave them a final stomach-turning dip last night before David Justice grabbed hold of the controls and directed the Yankees to the customary final stop on their postseason ride.</p>
        <p>It was a thrill a minute.</p>
        <p>Just when it seemed that the Seattle Mariners might force a decisive seventh game and maybe create an all-wild-card World Series with the Mets, Justice created the first Subway Series between the Mets and the Yankees. He did it by crushing a three-run home run into the third tier of the right-field stands in the seventh inning, wiping out a 4-3 Seattle lead and propelling the Yankees to a 9-7 victory to clinch the American League Championship Series by four games to two.</p>
        <p>The Yankees claimed their spot in the Subway Series 24 hours 38 minutes after the Mets had taken the first step.</p>
        <p>The World Series opens Saturday night at Yankee Stadium, the first Subway Series in 44 years.</p>
        <p>Justice's electrifying shot was typical of the performance the playoff-proven outfielder has given the Yankees since they acquired him in a surprise trade with the Cleveland Indians on June 29. The Yankees, needing to bolster their offense, had tried to induce Juan Gonzalez to come to New York in a trade with Detroit, and they had tried to wrest Sammy Sosa from the Chicago Cubs.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez and the Cubs wouldn't budge, but out of the ashes of those talks came Justice. He did not ride in on a white horse, but he hit as if he had.</p>
        <p>''He can hit, there's no question about that,'' Lou Piniella, the disappointed Mariners manager, said. ''He's been a great hitter in this league for a long time. He hangs in there real well against left-handed pitchers. He did in this series, especially tonight.''</p>
        <p>Justice slugged his game-turning home run against Arthur Rhodes, a tough left-handed reliever. In Game 2, Justice led off the eighth inning against Rhodes with the Yankees losing, 1-0. He lashed a double off the left-field fence, triggering a seven-run outburst that won the game.</p>
        <p>Asked why he has fared so well against Rhodes, Justice said, ''I think it's because I respect him so much that I really don't try to do too much.''</p>
        <p>Facing him in the seventh inning last night with the Yankees down a run and runners at first and third, Justice said he went to bat thinking ''get this run in; let me tie this game up.'' He did more than tie it.</p>
        <p>In the A.L.C.S., Justice drove in eight runs and hit two home runs. In a remarkable 88 postseason games, Justice has knocked in a record 51 runs.</p>
        <p>One of his home runs and runs batted in won the World Series for the Atlanta Braves in Game 6 in 1995.</p>
        <p>''This is right behind it,'' Justice said of last night's home run, which clinched the most valuable player award for the A.L.C.S. ''It's like the 100 meters in the Olympics. The gold medalist runs a 9.7 and the silver medalist 9.71. This is a 9.71. It was just magical as I rounded the bases to see this place erupt.''</p>
        <p>That the Yankees have reached this point has confounded some people because despite their recent history of postseason success, they suffered a late-season spiral in which they lost 15 of their final 18 games.</p>
        <p>''You always have doubts,'' Justice said in response to a question. ''Especially when you're not playing well. But every team goes through a tough time each season, and we were just hoping our tough period was at the end of the season. You think maybe things aren't going to go right for you, but we turned it around.''</p>
        <p>Piniella was well aware of the Yankees' skid.</p>
        <p>''I kept asking our advance scouts, when we had our preparatory meeting here, was Joe doing anything different,'' Lou Piniella, the Mariners' manager, said, referring to Joe Torre, his Yankees counterpart. ''He said, 'He's always behind; he hasn't been able to do all that much.' ''</p>
        <p>Torre acknowledged before the game that his team was having problems at that time.</p>
        <p>''I felt my club was very tight going the last couple of weeks, trying to close it out, just to get to postseason play,'' he said. ''Since we have gotten in postseason play, it is a whole new set of circumstances, as far as pressure. This has been the most unusual season I've had as far as being unpredictable. I think we've all been distracted at times.''</p>
        <p>Bob Gebhard, former general manager of the Colorado Rockies, scouted the Yankees for the St. Louis Cardinals for a while and was impressed by their turnaround.</p>
        <p>''I saw the Yankees at the end of the season when they were scuffling,'' Gebhard said. ''Joe and his staff turned them around and they're playing pretty good baseball now.''</p>
        <p>The change had not escaped Piniella's notice.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, they're a different ball club,'' he said, comparing the Yankees with the team the scouts saw late in the season. ''Once they got into the postseason, their experience shows. Their starting pitching is very, very respectable, almost to the dominant point.''</p>
        <p>How does that experience reveal itself?</p>
        <p>''It's that confidence, it's that swagger, it's that feeling that 'we've done it before, we can do it again, lets rise up to the occasion,' '' Piniella said. ''They don't really get rattled over there. They play their game. They've had a heck of a run. You have to give them credit for what they've been able to do over there. It's something that really doesn't happen in sports too often anymore.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees, however, have not breezed through this postseason as they have others in recent seasons. Last year they won 11 of 12 games, the year before 11 of 13. In their first 11 games this year, they have lost four, one more than in those two seasons combined. Their late-season collapse and their postseason problems had some people thinking the Yankees' run could be halted.</p>
        <p>''They're a little more vulnerable,'' Piniella said. ''They're not as deep. That's the big thing. Their everyday players are excellent. They don't have as many horses to go to. But I'll tell you this. When that game starts, you have to go out and beat them. They don't give games away. They're still the team to beat.''</p>
