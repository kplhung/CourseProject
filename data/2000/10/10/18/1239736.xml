        <p>Talk of weak earnings continued to plague stocks yesterday, and major market averages moved sharply lower.</p>
        <p>''The market feels pretty ugly,'' said Bill Schneider, head of equity block trading at UBS Warburg. ''It is earnings-driven, and there is no readily definable moment when the market sees through the valley and sees the economy growing on the other side. Cash seems pretty good to a lot of people right now.''</p>
        <p>Broad sectors of the market were battered, from computer-related shares and telecommunications companies to banks and brokers.</p>
        <p>''When you start to take those groups and put them on the sell side, that is a lot of the market,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''Investors have been almost frantic to reduce positions ahead of earnings.''</p>
        <p>By the close of trading, the Nasdaq composite index had fallen 76.32 points, or 2.32 percent, to 3,213.96. It was the 10th decline for the index in the last dozen sessions.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index shed 24.65 points, or 1.79 percent, to 1,349.97. Among companies dragging the S.&amp; P. lower were America Online, which is expected to report third-quarter results today. It fell $9.01, or 17 percent, closing at $43.60. Another casualty was Time Warner, which AOL has agreed to buy. It dropped to $65.56, down $12.24.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average slumped by 149.09 points, or 1.46 percent, to 10,089.71. Breadth was strongly negative, with 2,129 Big Board issues declining and 829 advancing. Breadth on Nasdaq was also more than 2-to-1 negative.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan, Walt Disneyand Eastman Kodak were all big losers.</p>
        <p>Shares of I.B.M., another Dow component, rose $1.88, to $113, during regular trading hours. But Big Blue's stock fell sharply for a while in late-session trading, after the release of its third-quarter financial results. While earnings were in line with expectations, its revenue was slightly less than what Wall Street had expected. The stock traded as low as $108.56, then rebounded.</p>
        <p>Intel, which last month reported a modest slowdown in revenue growth and saw its share price cut in half, posted financial results after the market's close that were at the high end of its revised estimates. The stock, which gained 50 cents, to $36.19, during the day, settled at $36.56 after hours. It topped the most-active list.</p>
        <p>Teradyne, which makes semiconductor-testing equipment, said third-quarter earnings more than doubled from a year earlier. But it also said that shipments in the fourth quarter would fall by 2 to 4 percent compared with the third quarter. Investors focused on the latter, and sold the stock. Teradyne closed at $25, down $9.44, its lowest level since May 1999.</p>
        <p>Amazon.com and Yahoo were also hammered. Amazon fell $2.38, to $21.94. Shares of the company, an online bookseller, have fallen 23 percent in the last two sessions. Yahoo fell $6.31, to $48.94.</p>
        <p>Stocks of brokerage firms fared badly. The Goldman Sachs Group dropped $4.38, to $99.25. Lehman Brothers fell $4.56, to $118. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell $3.75, to $73.94.</p>
        <p>Drug stocks continued to move higher. Pfizer rose $1.25, to $44.94. Abbott Laboratories gained $1.06, to $51.50. And IDEC Pharmaceuticals jumped $14.44, to $182.06.</p>
        <p>The causes of the market's decline since the beginning of September have perplexed some money managers. ''I sometimes wake up wondering what I am missing,'' said Donald G. Berdine, chief investment officer at PNC Advisers in Pittsburgh. ''But I keep coming back to the solid fundamentals that got the Dow to 10,000 in the first place.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berdine said he expected the market to do considerably better in the final two months of the year.</p>
        <p>''Nasdaq will remain under pressure,'' he said, ''but I expect positive total returns in both the Dow and the S.&amp; P. 500 for the year.''</p>

        <p>Treasuries Are Higher  By The Associated Press</p>
        <p>Bond prices rose yesterday as jittery investors opted for government securities.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32, to a price of 100 19/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.67 percent from 5.73 percent on Monday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32, to 106 26/32. Its yield fell to 5.77 percent from 5.81 percent on Monday.</p>
