        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her most detailed views on foreign policy in the New York Senate race to date, yesterday called for the United States to reject isolationism and aggressively engage itself in world affairs in the tradition of President Harry S. Truman at the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>Staking out a more internationalist position than many of her fellow Democrats, Mrs. Clinton called for expanding the definition of American interests beyond the loss of American lives and the protection of American dollars to include such things as women's and human rights, environmental protection and the spread of deadly diseases.</p>
        <p>She cited American involvement in Bosnia and Kosovo as examples of foreign engagements she favored on moral and strategic ground, but also suggested that Americans needed to consider becoming involved in solving crises that are not only military in nature.</p>
        <p>''At this decisive moment in our history, I believe America needs a renewed internationalism, not an old isolation,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan. ''It very much is in our interest to assert the leadership required to meet our strategic and national security needs and interests around the world.'' Saying that the United States should do more than just intervene in ''splendid little wars'' in which it can prevail, Mrs. Clinton staked out a robust foreign policy approach that she said reflected the views of New York's current senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and two of its previous senators, Jacob K. Javits and Robert F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>And while aligning herself with her husband on many issues, she called for a broader foreign policy mandate that, for instance, considers disease fighting a national security issue and deems the rights of women a priority.</p>
        <p>''I think it has become increasingly clear that our efforts to ensure democracy and human rights cannot be considered marginal but are indeed central to our foreign policy objectives this century,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>The speech by the first lady marked the first time, with the exception of a discussion of Israel, that foreign policy has emerged as a potential issue in her race with Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican. It was also a reminder of the extent to which foreign policy concerns have faded in New York races in the last decade.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mrs. Clinton's aides said that in making the speech, she was as much trying to lay out what she said were differences with Mr. Lazio on foreign policy views as to highlight what some polls have found is concern among New Yorkers that Mr. Lazio does not have the maturity or experience to serve in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, campaigning on Long Island, responded by sharply questioning Mrs. Clinton for having too lax a standard for United States intervention in foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the record of Mrs. Clinton, it is a record of vacillation,'' he told reporter, although he said he had yet to read her speech. ''It is a record of inconsistency which creates opportunities for our adversaries, for people that resent America and America's principles, to undermine our interests, and undermine our principles throughout the world.</p>
        <p>''I think she has a very different record on foreign policy issues than I have. And I would take exception with her if she is trying to suggest that we ought to commit troops any time somebody asks. We've got to make some very tough decisions and those decisions include having to say no sometimes, when they undermine our ability to properly America's vital interests in different parts of the world.''</p>
        <p>In her speech, Mrs. Clinton blamed government and business leaders for doing too little to make known the connection between what happens overseas and the well-being of Americans at home.</p>
        <p>Something like the recent outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Uganda, she said, would have had little relevance to Americans 50 years ago, but today, because of improved transportation and movement of people across borders, could be a threat here.</p>
        <p>''We have to use our our moral and material strengths in ways that serve our evolving interests,'' she said. ''We have to ask ourselves what hope does the global market hold for the tens of millions of victims of child labor, who instead of going to school are sent out to work in the most dangerous and deadly conditions, or for the 100 million street children without homes or families whom I've seen everywhere from Brazil to Mongolia who are being left to fend for themselves.''</p>
        <p>Among her other concerns, she cited a commitment to advancing democracy in Russia. But she supported most favored nation trade status despite concerns about China's human rights record.</p>
        <p>William Kristol, a self-described Reagan-era internationalist and the editor of The Weekly Standard, said Mrs. Clinton's speech sounded like the thoughts of Senator Moynihan. But, he said, her remarks hearkened  back to Reagan as well. ''You've got to be happy that Democrats are now willing to embrace at least some aspects of energetic American leadership,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then he added: ''But are they willing to exert real leadership with real enemies and real casualties? Otherwise, you're talking about a conference on women's rights in Beijing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio canceled a scheduled appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations, but he is expected to speak to the group before the election.</p>
        <p>In her speech, Mrs. Clinton discussed several specific issues that she would likely deal with as senator.</p>
        <p>She said she would oppose lifting the embargo against Cuba until democracy took root there. She said she would support paying America's unpaid bills to the United Nations. She would also vote for a nuclear test ban treaty and to fund research for a missile defense system, she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton once again voiced her support for Israel and, while praising the tentative cease-fire agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians reached Monday, she made it clear the burden was on Yasir Arafat to end the violence.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Mrs. Clinton attended a fund-raising luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria organized by Caroline Kennedy. About 800 women contributed $100,000 to participate in the event.</p>
