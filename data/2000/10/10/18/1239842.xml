      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of Oct 15 article on effect of resurgent Arab nationalism on Mideast peace effort, which misstated name and mission of Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy; group holds it is public education foundation, not pro-Israeli group; article also misspelled name of institute fellow David Makovsky</p>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Sunday about the effect of resurgent Arab nationalism on the Middle East peace effort misstated the name and mission of a policy group whose director commented on the situation. It is the Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy, not Near Eastern Affairs. It describes itself as a public educational foundation that supports scholarly research and debate on the Middle East, not a pro-Israeli group.</p>
        <p>The article also misspelled the surname of an Israeli senior fellow at the institute whose concept of ''bottom-up peacemaking'' was cited. He is David Makovsky, not Markovsky.</p>
