        <p>Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik fought a grim battle to a 66-move draw in Game 6 of their world championship chess match in London yesterday. The early tide of the game saw Kramnik press hard to produce a mating attack, but Kasparov forced exchanges of material that pulled him through what looked like the worst. But it wasn't.</p>
        <p>Kramnik mobilized his rooks and came in for a strike on the other wing. It was enough to revive the pressure that the challenger seemed to have lost earlier.</p>
        <p>It looked for a long time as if Kramnik was going to take this game, but a clever maneuver with queen and knight forced chances of perpetual check that Kramnik couldn't stop.</p>
        <p>Kasparov accepts the Queen's Gambit again, despite his troubles in Game 4. But Kramnik, feeling sure that Kasparov has found improvements in the endgame following 7 dc Qd1 8 Rd1 Bc5, goes back to Botvinnik's old favorite, 7 a4, preventing any thought of a black advance with  . . . b5.</p>
        <p>Black's counterattacking prospects are diminished, but White has a hole at b4 beckoning intruders.  After 11 Nc3, Black has to reckon with the space-gaining 12 d5, and thus moves to block it with 11 . . . Nd5. Kramnik likes the thrust with 13 h4, which sets up a dangerous gambit after 13 . . . Bh4 14 Nh4 Nc3 15 bc Qh4 16 Re3 to be followed by 17 Rg3. Kasparov refuses to oblige him.</p>
        <p>Kramnik's 17 h6 loosened the dark squares in the black kingside, and he brought his queen knight to mass for an attack with 18 Ne4. After 18 . . . Nc7 19. Nc5, Kramnik charged in with 19 Nc5 Bd5 20 Ra3, but after Kasparov's 20 . . . Nc6! 21 Bd5 Qd5, the threat was 22 . . . Bc5, winning material.</p>
        <p>Kramnik defended with 22 Ncd7 Rad8 (not 22 . . . Nd4? because of 23 Qg4) 23 Nc6 Rd7 24 Ne7 Ree7, but after 25 Rc3 f6 26 Be3 the white pressure had evaporated. Still, Kramnik had another card to play: control of the open c line.</p>
        <p>Kramnik had enough rook pressure to force the exchange with 31 . . .  Rc5 32 dc, thus creating a healthy passed c pawn out of the former isolated d4 pawn. And it was not long before Kramnik's rook took a hearty grip on the open d line with 37 Rd1 and 39 Rd6.</p>
        <p>Kramnik leads the 16-game match, 3 1/2-2 1/2. Game 7 is tomorrow.</p>
