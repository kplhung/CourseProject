        <p>Acknowledging that sales had fallen after reports of more than 100 deaths linked to the failure of Firestone tires now being recalled, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced today that it would lay off indefinitely 450 workers at its factory in Decatur, Ill., and would close  the Decatur factory and two other plants for two to four weeks.</p>

        <p>Acknowledging that sales had fallen after reports of more than 100 deaths linked to the failure of Firestone tires now being recalled, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced today that it would lay off indefinitely 450 workers at its factory in Decatur, Ill., and would close  the Decatur factory and two other plants for two to four weeks.</p>
        <p>The Decatur factory has produced tires with some of the highest failure rates, according to the Ford Motor Company and Firestone. Today's layoffs amount to a quarter of the factory's work force.</p>
        <p>While Firestone's parent, the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, mentioned last month the possibility of closing the Decatur factory, John Lampe, Firestone's new chairman and chief executive, said today that the company had no plans to do so. But Mr. Lampe also raised the prospect today of further retrenchment if demand continued to erode, although he did not provide specifics.</p>
        <p>''We will continue to inform our people at the earliest possible time if further cutbacks are necessary,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe said that although sales of Firestone-brand tires to automakers remained strong, sales of Firestone replacement tires to consumers had dropped. He declined to provide figures. Mr. Lampe said that the company was reducing its overall production by a fifth for the next two months, even though Firestone-brand tires only account for half the company's sales.</p>
        <p>Firestone also sells Bridgestone tires, which go mainly on Japanese-brand automobiles, and other brands.</p>
        <p>Firestone's inventory of unsold tires is 50 percent larger than usual now, partly because of the slower sales but also because the company stockpiled tires this summer in preparation for a possible strike by union workers that did not take place, Mr. Lampe said. In addition, the company has found itself with large numbers of tires in smaller sizes as more Americans choose vehicles that use larger tires.</p>
        <p>The three factories cutting back production -- the Decatur factory plus factories in La Vergne, Tenn., and in Oklahoma City -- make a high proportion of Firestone-brand tires and tires in smaller sizes and had particularly large inventories accumulated before a labor agreement was reached on Sept. 4, Mr. Lampe said. All three factories will be closed for the second half of December, and the Oklahoma City and La Vergne factories will also be closed from Oct. 29 to Nov. 11.</p>
        <p>Laid-off workers and workers furloughed for two to four weeks will be entitled to unemployment benefits. Unionized workers with at least two years of seniority will receive additional payments from the company for up to 6 to 12 months, raising their overall benefits to 80 percent of previous income.</p>
        <p>Ford and Firestone dealers have been besieged by angry Ford Explorer owners, many of whom have been unable to find replacements for their tires since the recall was announced on Aug. 9. But Mr. Lampe said that Firestone and other tire makers had replaced 4.2 million of the 6.5 million recalled tires, and he predicted that all of the tires would be replaced by the end of next month. Firestone's production of replacement tires will not be affected by today's announcement, because most of the production is taking place at other factories, Mr. Lampe said.</p>
        <p>Stephen Garman, the city manager in Decatur, said that many of the laid-off workers should be able to find other jobs, although some might not have skills that closely match the available openings. The local economy is at full employment and the city has just hired an advertising firm to try to attract people from other cities to fill vacancies in a wide range of occupations, he said.</p>
        <p>''Our economy is in a position to absorb a great number of these employees,'' Mr. Garman said. ''If you're going to have this kind of problem, now is the time to have it.''</p>
        <p>The layoffs and reductions in production came as regulators continued to be flooded with complaints about the recalled 15-inch Firestone ATX and Wilderness tires mounted mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today that it had received more than 3,500 complaints linking the tires to 119 deaths and more than 500 injuries.</p>
        <p>The previous time the agency provided figures on complaints, on Sept. 19, there were 2,200 complaints involving 103 deaths and more than 400 injuries. But the agency subsequently said that two of those deaths were a German shepherd dog and a black Persian cat, not people.</p>
        <p>The agency, which is part of the Department of Transportation, accepts complaints from the public, lawyers and law enforcement officials but does little to check their veracity. Instead, regulators are focusing now on an engineering analysis of the tires to learn why they are failing, an agency official said.</p>
        <p>The traffic safety agency recently opened a separate investigation into Firestone Steeltex tires after receiving 169 complaints about them, involving two deaths. The Steeltex tires are mounted on the largest sport utility vehicles and pickups, notably the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban.</p>
        <p>An expert retained by Firestone to seek the cause of the problem, Sanjay Govindjee, said in a letter released by the company on Monday night that he was focusing on the materials that Firestone had used. The steel-belted tires slowly develop cracks inside between the rubber and the steel belts, and eventually fail as a result, he said.</p>
