        <p>AFTER warning investors last month that its revenue would not meet earlier expectations, the Intel Corporation reported third-quarter numbers yesterday that beat analysts' lowered forecasts. But the company gave wary investors other reasons for concern, reporting stagnant chip sales and projecting a relatively soft holiday season.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Intel executives said they were not seeing the signs of a price war among chip makers, or of a widespread drop in demand for personal computers -- fears of which may be causing investors to drive down the stock prices across the board in the sector.</p>
        <p>Intel reported third-quarter earnings before acquisition-related and other costs of $2.9 billion, or 41 cents a share, compared with $1.9 billion, or 27 cents a share, for the period a year earlier. The earnings came on revenue of $8.73 billion, up 19 percent from $7.33 billion.</p>
        <p>The per-share earnings were 3 cents higher than analysts had expected. But the 41 cents was in line with analysts' projections made before a Sept. 21 warning from Intel, in which the company cautioned that its revenue would suffer from suddenly weakening demand in Europe.</p>
        <p>Net income for the company, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., rose to $2.51 billion, or 36 cents a share, from $1.46 billion, or a split-adjusted 21 cents. The latest figure includes a higher-than-expected $966 million gain from interest and the sale of investments and the acquisition-related costs.</p>
        <p>Andrew D. Bryant, chief financial officer of Intel, reiterated yesterday that Intel had suffered from a steep drop in demand from Europe. Mr. Bryant said that even through mid-September, Intel still expected to post a blockbuster third quarter but that because of the weak euro and a rise in oil prices, demand in Europe had ''stopped dead in its tracks.''</p>
        <p>He said uncertainty about the continued weakness in Europe and its  potential to spill over to the rest of the world was causing Intel to be  conservative about its growth projections for the fourth quarter. Mr.  Bryant said the company expected revenue to grow 4 percent to 8 percent, which is on the low end of recent fourth-quarter growth of 8 percent to 12 percent, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''The question is, does it start in Europe and spread?'' Mr. Bryant said of the softening demand.</p>
        <p>Still, industry analysts expressed relief at the numbers and the projections, as some among their ranks had expected fourth-quarter growth expectations to come in much lower, in the 3 percent to 5 percent range.</p>
        <p>''People walked away relieved,'' said Greg Mischou, senior semiconductor analyst with UBS Warburg, referring to the earnings conference call analysts held with company executives.</p>
        <p>But analysts also see reason for continued caution. Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said that ''while revenues were higher than we anticipated, the key thing is the bread and butter business was flat,'' referring to the fact that Intel's microprocessor sales did not increase from the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joseph expects an industry price war that may benefit consumers buying personal computers, but that could cut into the profit margins of the chip makers. He said the coming six months could be clouded with ''competition and excess supply,'' an outlook others share.</p>
        <p>''Demand is kind of lousy, and competition is heating up with A.M.D.,'' said Hans Mosesmann, a managing director at Prudential Securities, referring to Advanced Micro Devices, a competitor of Intel's. ''This is going to be tough for Intel in the near term.''</p>
        <p>But Intel said there were no signs of a price war. The company cut prices on Sunday for three of its Pentium III processors, lopping 26 percent off the price of its 600 megahertz chip and 16 percent from the price of its 650-  and 667-megahertz chips. A company spokesman, Michael Sullivan, said the moves were routine cuts that were part of Intel's pricing strategy.</p>
        <p>Some industry analysts assert that Intel accelerated its price-cutting schedule to counter competition from Advanced Micro Devices, but Mr. Sullivan said he had no knowledge of an accelerated schedule. And he said the move did not represent the start of a price war. ''This is not a knee-jerk reaction to what's going on in the marketplace,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Intel executives said that outside of Europe, growth in the personal computer market remained normal, and that they expected growth to continue at the same pace. In addition, the executives said Intel had strong growth in businesses other than its sale of PC-based microprocessors, such as in its wireless, flash-memory and communications businesses, but they declined to cite specific figures.</p>
        <p>Shares of Intel rose 50 cents yesterday, to $36.19. They climbed as high as $38.38 in after-hours trading.</p>
        <p>Drew Peck, managing director at SG Cowen &amp; Company, said pressure might remain on the stock this year. He anticipates that the pricing situation for microprocessors ''is getting worse by the day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peck expects Intel's quarterly results to be met ''very, very positively by investors'' but that the rise should soon be subject to other realities. ''This is a short-term opportunity in the stock, but nothing more than that,'' he said.</p>
