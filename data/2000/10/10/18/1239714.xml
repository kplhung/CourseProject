        <p>With a deal for a new Serbian government sealed, President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia turned his attention today to the challenge of forming a federal government and to forging a new relationship with the independent-minded republic of Montenegro.</p>
        <p>Making his first visit to the small coastal republic since becoming president, Mr. Kostunica met with Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, and with members of his ruling coalition, as well as with Orthodox church leaders. Yet the day only highlighted the difficulties he faces and the constitutional muddle that resulted from the recent presidential election, which Montenegro largely boycotted to protest constitutional changes wrought by Slobodan Milosevic. Mr. Milosevic finally conceded power after admitting that Mr. Kostunica had won the first-round of voting.</p>
        <p>The visit today was low-key with no crowds out to cheer Mr. Kostunica, and only a representative from the small People's Party at the airport to greet him. Because most Montenegrins followed their government's call to boycott the elections, few now regard him as carrying any legitimacy in Montenegro, although there is a general feeling of good will toward him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica said today that he was pleased with his talks. ''I am very interested in some more serious discussions about joint relations between Serbia and Montenegro,'' he said, using a much more considerate tone toward Montenegro than previously.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Djukanovic made it clear that he would not participate in a new federal government, and instead would hold out for more recognition of sovereignty for Montenegro, the last Yugoslav republic still joined with Serbia. But he said he would continue discussions with Mr. Kostunica and the Democratic Opposition of Serbia to work out a future relationship with Serbia.</p>
        <p>Montenegro continues to push for a new alignment with Serbia based on a proposal it made last last year to Mr. Milosevic, who ignored it. The plan called for a very loose confederation of sovereign states, each controlling the troops on its soil, but conducting foreign and economic policy together.</p>
        <p>Just before Mr. Kostunica visited, negotiations abruptly broke off on Monday night in Belgrade over efforts to form a government with the Montenegrin Socialist People's Party, a pro-Milosevic party that did take part in the elections and subsequently won most of the parliamentary seats allotted to Montenegro.</p>
        <p>The Socialist People's Party had demanded that Mr. Milosevic's party also be allowed a ministerial post in any federal government, something that Mr. Kostunica's supporters in the Democratic Opposition of Serbia ruled out immediately.</p>
        <p>For 10 days now, since his inauguration as president of Yugoslavia, Mr. Kostunica has been trying unsuccessfully to solidify his position end the growing estrangement of Montenegro from Serbia that began three years ago under Mr. Milosevic. Mr. Kostunica wants to form a federal government that will run the foreign affairs and defense ministries as well as rebuild all federal institutions.</p>
        <p>He has chosen to negotiate a coalition government, and tried to encourage Mr. Djukanovic to send representatives or experts to participate in the government. But the Montenegrin president has rejected sharing power with his Montenegrin opponents, who until recently supported Mr. Milosevic and his aggressive policy against Montenegro.</p>
        <p>''They are not over-enthusiastic with our coalition with the Socialist People's Party, but we shall continue to collaborate with Djukanovic's party,'' Mr. Djindjic said in an interview with the Belgrade-based radio station B92. ''We need passions to calm down.''</p>
        <p>Despite his impressive personal victory at the polls, Mr. Kostunica and the Democratic Opposition of Serbia that supported him do not dominate the federal Parliament. By law, if a Serbian is elected president he must appoint a Montenegrin as vice president.</p>
        <p>A coalition with the Socialist People's Party is the most likely outcome. Both sides have agreed to basic principles of cooperation, and either of the party's two vice presidents, Predrag Bulatovic and Zoran Zizic, have been suggested for the post of vice president.</p>
        <p>Yet talks clearly broke off with some rancor on Monday night with the Democratic Party's leader, Zoran Djindjic, saying he would not accept members of the Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia in the government. ''We will not tolerate blackmail,'' he said, and threatening to bypass the federal authorities if he had to get foreign aid into the country.</p>
        <p>The wrangling with the Montenegrins is driven to some extent by their own power struggles, but is also a leftover of the damage wrought by the previous government. Mr. Djukanovic is insisting on the replacement of generals of the Yugoslav Army who served under Mr. Milosevic and whom he blames for raising tension in the region. Mr. Kostunica has so far retained the generals, and has commended them for not using violence against the popular uprising on Oct. 5.</p>
