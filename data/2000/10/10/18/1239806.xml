        <p>Gov. George W. Bush tried to paint Vice President Al Gore tonight as a traditional big-spending Democrat whose proposals would lead to a bigger, more intrusive federal government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's spending plans, Mr. Bush asserted, are far bigger than anything proposed by President Clinton when he was running for office, and put even Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis to shame.</p>
        <p>As is often the case when it comes to fiscal policy, there are different ways of evaluating Mr. Bush's claims. Looking at it one way, Mr. Bush has a point. Looking at it another way, Mr. Gore's response that government would actually shrink under his leadership is also credible.</p>
        <p>Campaigning against big government has long been a staple of conservative politics. Whether it still works in an era when the government expects to enjoy huge and growing budget surpluses for years is an open question.</p>
        <p>''This is a big spender,'' Mr. Bush said of his rival, ''and he ought to be proud of it.''</p>
        <p>Using his own figures, Mr. Gore has proposed about $1 trillion in new spending over the next decade. By the Bush campaign's estimate, Mr. Clinton's spending proposals when he first ran for president amounted to $800 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton was running when the federal budget deficit was hitting a record high, and both parties were constrained from proposing new programs. Mr. Gore is running against a backdrop of surpluses outside the Social Security system projected to be $2.2 trillion in the next decade.</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Gore suggested that the better way to look at spending levels was relative to the size of the total economy. By that measure, he said, his proposals would put spending on a track that would leave it at its lowest level in 50 years.</p>
        <p>His campaign said that by 2008, government outlays would be 17 percent of the gross domestic product, the lowest level since 1956 and down from 18.7 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also said that under the Clinton administration, civilian government employment had fallen by 300,000. The number is actually closer to 400,000. But according to figures in the administration's most recent budget documents, most of the reduction -- 286,000 -- has come from the Pentagon, and is associated with the slimming of the military following the end of the cold war.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely not,'' Mr. Gore replied when asked whether he was a big spender.</p>
        <p>The debate over spending tonight was part of the campaign-long debate over how best to allocate the projected surpluses. Mr. Gore pressed his attack that Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan would leave little or no money for other priorities, including increased financing for education.</p>
        <p>''Because the governor has all this money for a tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Gore said, Mr. Bush would not allocate as much money as he would to paying off the national debt. Mr. Gore has pledged to pay off the $3.4 trillion debt in a dozen years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said his tax cut would benefit the wealthy, since they pay the most taxes. But he said lower- and middle-income people would get proportionately more, a claim that is correct in percentage terms but not in dollar terms. And he suggested that the alternative to sending excess revenues back to taxpayers was to unleash a flood of new spending.</p>
        <p>''If this were a spending contest, I'd come in second,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I readily admit, I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.''</p>
