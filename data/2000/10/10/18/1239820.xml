        <p>There used to be a time when a network television executive could count on a few things year in and year out. One was that a sweeps month, ripped-from-the-headlines, made-for-TV movie would draw a very large audience. (Who could resist Alyssa Milano as Amy Fisher?) Another was that the annual ''Miss America'' pageant would have solid ratings as well.</p>

        <p>There used to be a time when a network television executive could count on a few things year in and year out. One was that a sweeps month, ripped-from-the-headlines, made-for-TV movie would draw a very large audience. (Who could resist Alyssa Milano as Amy Fisher?) Another was that the annual ''Miss America'' pageant would have solid ratings as well.</p>
        <p>That is why ABC paid handsomely to steal it from NBC a few of years ago. But things change.</p>
        <p>Blame it on presidential politics, conflict in the Middle East, the start of the new season or the evolution of gender roles, but the Miss America contest received scant attention this year. (Did you know that it was on last weekend?)</p>
        <p>When it was shown on ABC on Saturday, it received the lowest recorded ratings in its 41 years on television. According to Nielsen Media Research, about 8.8 million homes tuned in.</p>
        <p>The pageant's second-smallest household audience on record was in 1998, when it was watched in just over 10 million households on ABC. It had its largest recorded household audience in 1970, when it was watched in more than 22 million homes, according to Nielsen.</p>
        <p>ABC executives surmise that the contest's low ratings this year probably had a lot to do with the fact that it was up against fresh programming on the other networks for the first time in years.</p>
        <p>It has traditionally been shown in September, before the start of the new television season, when other networks are showing reruns and it can run virtually unopposed.</p>
        <p>ABC decided to push its showing of the contest back this year to avoid competition from the Olympics on NBC. Then again, since the Olympics coverage was watched by the smallest average audience in 30 years, maybe that was not such a good idea. (For those who are sorry they missed it, Miss Hawaii, Angela Perez Baraquio, was the winner).</p>
