        <p>The Delaware judge who imprisoned Brian C. Peterson in 1998 for his role in the death of his newborn son declined yesterday to impose new probation penalties relating to his arrest at a Mets game at Shea Stadium on Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Delaware probation officials, Judge Henry duPont Ridgely of Delaware Superior Court said he had accepted the recommendation by Mr. Peterson's probation supervisor in New Jersey against new sanctions. The ruling means that Mr. Peterson's original term of two years' probation and 300 hours of community service remains undisturbed.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we're pleased,'' said Mr. Peterson's lawyer, Russell M. Gioiella of Manhattan. ''Brian's very sorry for what occurred, and he's intent on working hard, going to school and satisfying his community service obligation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gioiella said Mr. Peterson, 22, of Wyckoff, N.J., was working part time in his family's video wholesale business and taking college liberal arts courses. As part of his community service obligation, Mr. Peterson is discussing his newborn son's death with teenagers, church groups and therapists who advise teenagers facing unwanted pregnancies, Mr. Gioiella said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peterson had faced the possibility of having his probation revoked if he had been convicted of any of the three charges the New York police filed against him on Sept. 26. The police accused him of interfering as they arrested his friend Raymond Maniaci, 21, also of Wyckoff, after Mr. Maniaci threw a bottle toward John Rocker, the outspoken relief pitcher for the Atlanta Braves. Mr. Maniaci pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct on Oct. 6 and was fined $250.</p>
        <p>During a court hearing at that time, Queens prosecutors dropped the most serious charge against Mr. Peterson -- resisting arrest -- which carried a penalty of up to a year in jail.</p>
        <p>Justice Robert Raciti of State Supreme Court said the other charges -- disorderly conduct and harassment -- would be dropped next April if Mr. Peterson stayed out of trouble.</p>
        <p>If he does so, Mr. Peterson will avoid a possible trial, which could affect his probation in the event of a conviction.</p>
        <p>Judge Ridgely suggested in his letter that the decision by the Queens prosecutors was a significant factor in his ruling. He instructed probation officials to inform him if the two remaining charges are not dismissed in six months.</p>
        <p>Before his arrest last month, Mr. Peterson had an unblemished probation record in the eight months since he was freed from a Delaware prison last January, officials said. He served 18 months of a two-year term for negligent manslaughter for dropping his son's body into a motel trash bin in Newark, Del., in November 1996. His former high school sweetheart, Amy S. Grossberg, also pleaded guilty to negligent manslaughter. She served 22 months of a 30-month term before she was freed last May.</p>
