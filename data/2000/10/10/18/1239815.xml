        <p>SECURE in living rooms and sports bars all over the greater metropolitan area, Mets' fans had that delightful opportunity to watch Yankees' fans squirm big-time last night.</p>
        <p>This win-win scenario lasted three hours -- hardly a complete game, the way American League games meander. Then David Justice clubbed a mammoth three-run homer in the seventh inning to propel a 9-7 victory over the Mariners for the Yankees' 37th pennant since they got the hang of it back in 1921. Now there will be a resumption of that ancient New York tradition and very recently a New York obsession, the Subway Series. Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy ride.</p>

        <p>SECURE in living rooms and sports bars all over the greater metropolitan area, Mets' fans had that delightful opportunity to watch Yankees' fans squirm big-time last night.</p>
        <p>This win-win scenario lasted three hours -- hardly a complete game, the way American League games meander. Then David Justice clubbed a mammoth three-run homer in the seventh inning to propel a 9-7 victory over the Mariners for the Yankees' 37th pennant since they got the hang of it back in 1921. Now there will be a resumption of that ancient New York tradition and very recently a New York obsession, the Subway Series. Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy ride.</p>
        <p>The Mets fulfilled their end of this inta-borough (as we say in New York) connection by winning their fourth pennant on a manic Monday night, through Mike Hampton's pitching that was so good that Shea Stadium could exult early and often.</p>
        <p>Last night, the Yankees had to sweat. The ageless Orlando Hernandez fell behind by four runs but then the Yankees, as it always used to be in this month, started to score distinct little triumphs with marginal players, currently named Sojo and Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>In the seventh inning the Yankees applied frontier Justice to the Mariners, and you could hear airline stocks plummeting due to the loss of transcontinental business.</p>
        <p>Only in their heart of hearts did Mets' fans know if they truly wanted a piece of the Yankees, or have the Yankees humiliated in some epic home-field collapse. It would have been a fascinating choice, but they have no option now.</p>
        <p>The Subway Series will begin Saturday night in the Bronx, with Paul O'Neill in resurgence and Roger Clemens, perhaps, able to throw flames in his home park without fear of feeling a baseball whistle near his own jowls and Joe Torre pushing all the right buttons, as he almost always does.</p>
        <p>The truth is, just about anybody with a MetroCard tucked in a wallet, whether a baseball fan or not, feels totally entitled to a Subway Series. Yet there was a time when the Subway Series dared not speak its name, lest it be pelted with ridicule. For many years, the Yankees lowered themselves to play the Mets, but only for charity or exercise. The Mets were an afterthought, the lesser civic child.</p>
        <p>The Subway Series was once an ongoing part of New York heritage, usually involving the Brooklyn Dodgers as the National League entry -- in 1941, 1947, 1949, 1951 (an odd variation involving a team from Manhattan called the Giants), and then back to the normal Brooklyn-Bronx infighting in 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956. Even in those modest times of rudimentary television and relatively modest behavior, it was a very big thing.</p>
        <p>However, for four seasons, a Subway Series was impossible, by definition, derailed by the defection of the Dodgers and Giants to some other coast. Then in 1962, the Mets were formed, but under such draconian conditions that it seemed absurd to even think the two teams could ever meet in October.</p>
        <p>The early Mets were more fun than a barrel of monkeys. The Yankees could be out on the road, clubbing Kansas City or Cleveland into submission, and word would reach them in the hinterlands that all of New York was tittering about Marvelous Marv's latest flub.</p>
        <p>Marvin Eugene Throneberry -- no longer with us, alas -- was the perfect symbol of the unequal tangent between the Mets and Yankees. He was a former Yankee farmhand who surfaced with the Mets early in 1962, and proceeded to have a legendary season of miscues, mishaps, gaffes and fumbles.</p>
        <p>Harrumph. That would be the reaction of your basic Yankee fan. What's so much fun about a guy who couldn't even carry Mantle's glove? Some people got it and some people didn't. The battle was on -- the eternal joust between darkness and light, overkill and mirth. The Mets caterwauled for attention and the Yankees cringed in snooty horror. Think of the flighty Richard Simmons buzzing around the head of an aghast David Letterman.</p>
        <p>Even when the Yankees went through a few lean years after 1964, their fans treated it as temporary insanity. When the Mets got good, it always seemed like an aberration. Now they will meet.</p>
        <p>The city hasn't been this nutty about sports on a nightly basis since late spring of 1994, when Madison Square Garden would quiver with the intensity of Mark Messier one night and the next it would quiver with the energy of Patrick Ewing. But those two teams were not on a collision course. The heat of that June was only a bland predictor of the frenzy about to erupt. The Mets wanted the Yanks? Be careful what you wish for.</p>
