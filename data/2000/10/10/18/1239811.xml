        <p>In tonight's presidential debate, Gov. George W. Bush presented himself as a champion of a patients' bill of rights in Texas, saying he ''brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the state of Texas.'' He made the same assertion in television commercials during the Republican primaries.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush was rarely regarded as a leader on the issue in Texas, and his record is mixed.</p>
        <p>''If he wants to say, 'I reformed the tort system,' then that's fair game,'' Reggie James, director of the advocacy group Consumers Union in Texas, has said. ''But if he wants to say he reformed health care, that's a different animal. The reforms happened despite him, not because of him.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, the State Legislature approved a patients' protection bill that would have required annual report cards for health maintenance organizations and would have forced them to provide necessary emergency-room care. Mr. Bush vetoed the measure, but he did instruct the state's insurance commissioner to draft rules covering some aspects of the bill, earning praise from some consumer advocates who had criticized his veto.</p>
        <p>In 1997, lawmakers again pushed for a patients' bill of rights. In the debate, Mr. Bush spoke of supporting a provision that would make Texas the first state to allow patients to sue any H.M.O. for malpractice if it denied necessary care.</p>
        <p>But during the 1997 legislative session, Mr. Bush was not initially so supportive of the lawsuit provision. He warned of a veto and came into  conflict with the bill's sponsor, Senator David Sibley, one of his staunchest Republican allies. Mr. Sibley even complained on the Senate floor about the governor's staff.</p>
        <p>''I can't make them happy no matter what I do, unless I completely gut the bill,'' said Mr. Sibley, who now credits Mr. Bush for being supportive of other patients' protection measures in 1997.</p>
        <p>Many Democrats described Mr. Bush as having little involvement on the overall bill.</p>
        <p>Representative Patricia Gray, a Democrat, sponsored a bill requiring H.M.O.'s to allow women direct access to their obstetrician-gynecologists without having to see a ''gatekeeper'' doctor first. Mr. Bush mentioned the provision in the debate, but Ms. Gray has said he and his staff did little to help the bill.</p>
        <p>The Legislature approved the lawsuit provision by a wide margin. Mr. Bush allowed the provision to become law without his signature.</p>
