        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki, who in May offered a state bailout to help Nassau County out of its fiscal crisis, yesterday criticized Nassau Democrats' plans to raise the county portion of municipal property tax bills by 16.3 percent next year.</p>
        <p>''I think a massive property tax increase is clearly the wrong way to go,'' Mr. Pataki said at a news conference in the Capitol in Albany. ''The state didn't come in to help Nassau County so that it could continue to spend too much and to tax too much; that is not the goal. I certainly would be personally opposed to any significant property tax increase.''</p>

        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki, who in May offered a state bailout to help Nassau County out of its fiscal crisis, yesterday criticized Nassau Democrats' plans to raise the county portion of municipal property tax bills by 16.3 percent next year.</p>
        <p>''I think a massive property tax increase is clearly the wrong way to go,'' Mr. Pataki said at a news conference in the Capitol in Albany. ''The state didn't come in to help Nassau County so that it could continue to spend too much and to tax too much; that is not the goal. I certainly would be personally opposed to any significant property tax increase.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pataki said he would reserve final judgment until the state board overseeing the bailout plan gave its opinion on the Democrats' tax proposal, part of its plan to balance the books through 2004.</p>
        <p>His fellow Republican, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, who has the power to veto any tax increase, said yesterday that the 16.3 percent figure proposed by the Democrats who control the County Legislature was too high. But he said he was willing to work with the Democrats before deciding whether to veto any part of their proposed budget.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Democrats submitted a draft of their budget and a financial plan for the next three years to the state oversight board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, and said that they, too, would heed the board before voting on the budget tomorrow.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, they revealed other details about their plans, saying they would try to repair what they called years of financial mismanagement by raising $95 million in additional county property taxes on houses and businesses next year while cutting spending by about $145 million.</p>
        <p>The Democrats said they would raise the county's share of the property tax -- which makes up just 19 percent of the overall property tax bill -- by 16.3 percent next year. That includes a 3.8 percent rise in taxes that Mr. Gulotta included in his 2001 budget proposal last month after years of resisting even minimal tax increases that would have kept pace with the rate of inflation.</p>
        <p>For the average household, which now pays $1,050 annually in county property taxes, the tax increase would add $165 a year to the cost of living in one of the most expensive places in the nation.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have accepted Mr. Gulotta's proposal for 3 percent property tax increases in each year from 2002 through 2004.</p>
        <p>Aides to Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the legislature's presiding officer, said the 2001 budget totals $2.23 billion, slightly higher than the $2.21 billion budget proposed a month ago by Mr. Gulotta and slightly less than last year's adopted budget.</p>
        <p>They also said the Democrats' budget would produce an $18.9 million surplus next year.</p>
        <p>''The plan presented today sets forth a framework for Nassau County to emerge from a broken, fiscally mismanaged county into a vibrant,  healthy county,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''We believe that in this time of World Series time, we have hit a home run with this budget.''</p>
        <p>She said she planned to brief Mr. Gulotta and Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader, yesterday on the budget, but added that the plan could still be modified after all sides, including the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, weigh in. The board expects to receive a separate budget plan from Mr. Schmitt by today.</p>
        <p>In May, Mr. Pataki offered the county $100 million in aid and a restructuring of its crushing $2.6 billion debt if it cut hundreds of millions of dollars in costs through 2004.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said then that the county's financial problems could be resolved without a tax increase. Democrats agreed, until a projected shortfall of $233 million for 2001 grew by $66 million early last month and $19 million in unanticipated borrowing costs came to light in recent weeks. The governor's comments yesterday came in response to a reporter's question about the size of the proposed tax increase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said the proposed tax increase greatly exceeded the amount the county's 1.3 million residents should be asked to shoulder, even as the county teeters on the brink of bankruptcy and faces the threat of losing day-to-day fiscal authority to the state board.</p>
        <p>''I submitted my budget on Sept. 15 and they have reviewed it backwards and forwards and inside out,'' Mr. Gulotta said of the Democrats. ''They have critiqued it and commented on it, and here we are two days before NIFA expects a consensus document, and for the first time I have received the proposal of the Democratic majority. That is not right.''</p>
        <p>Although Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the state board, has warned the various factions of county government for weeks to drop the political bickering and work together, the bitterness and blame among them seemed only to intensify yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said the Democrats had planned an even higher tax increase, citing a public notice they placed in Newsday that says their  budget includes a 40 percent county property tax increase and a $184 million increase in overall spending. But Darren S. Bloch, the chief of staff to the Democratic lawmakers, said Mr. Gulotta was ''completely misleading the public.'' He said such public notices have traditionally inflated the budget figures to allow room for possible increases in taxes and spending. He said the final budgets never come close to those figures.</p>
        <p>Phoebe B. Goodman, the executive director of the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee and a longtime county budget critic, said she found the tax increase proposal refreshing. She said the Republicans' refusal to increase taxes incrementally in the past contributed to the county's current problems.</p>
        <p>''I think it is probably realistic,'' Ms. Goodman said. ''I assume it is more realistic than either Gulotta or the legislative Republicans trying to balance the budget without a tax increase. Sooner or later, you have to raise taxes; there is an increased cost of living. I just wish they had all come to agreement on a budget.''</p>
