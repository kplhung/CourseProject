        <p>Slowly, but inexorably, Laveranues Coles, the fastest player in the history of Florida State football, is making an impact on the Jets' offense.</p>
        <p>Coles, a rookie, had more receptions against the Patriots last Sunday -- six -- than any other Jets wide receiver has had in a game this year.</p>
        <p>The offense will need to be sharp against the Miami Dolphins Monday night. The Dolphins, perched with the Jets atop the American Football Conference East at 5-1, are doing such unusual things defensively that their statistics read like typographical errors. Their opponents have scored only three touchdowns, for example, the fewest a team has yielded over the first six games of a season since 1977. The number of points the Dolphins have given up, 51, is the lowest over 6 games since that year.</p>
        <p>Coles will not be the only player the Jets will use to move the ball on the Dolphins' defense. Running back Curtis Martin, quarterback Vinny Testaverde and the offensive line will all be more important. But despite the Jets' gaudy start, the team is getting diminished production from the wide receivers. Does Keyshawn Johnson's absence have something to do with it? Or is it the nerve damage in Testaverde's left side?</p>
        <p>The team's leading receiver is Richie Anderson, the fullback, with 24 receptions. He is followed by Martin, who has 23, and then the starting receivers, Wayne Chrebet (21) and Dedric Ward (16). Testaverde is averaging fewer than 6 yards an attempt, a paltry figure that he has not sunk to since his days at Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Vincent Brisby, a big, experienced receiver who was picked up from the Patriots, has not suited up for a game in weeks.</p>
        <p>So while Chrebet (2 receptions) and Ward (1) were bundled up by the Patriots' man-to-man defense, Coles broke free. His 6 catches for only 53 yards did not amount to much. But he looked impressive on several plays, including one in which Testaverde barely avoided a sack and tossed an inside screen to Coles at the line of scrimmage. He was nearly stopped for no gain, but Coles put a move on two tacklers and broke out to produce a 4-yard gain instead of a loss.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh was not surprised.</p>
        <p>''He's got some running skills,'' Groh said. ''He gained something like 6,000 yards in high school, so he does have some run-after-the-catch skills.''</p>
        <p>Actually, at Ribault High School in Jacksonville, Fla., Coles rushed for almost 5,000 yards. When he was timed at Florida State, where he joined the team as a running back, he ran an eye-popping 4.19 seconds for the 40-yard run.</p>
        <p>But he had legal problems in college, first in a family dispute and then in a well-publicized arrest that involved unauthorized discounts at a department store. Suddenly, Coles, who was kicked off the Florida State team, was no longer going to be a first-round draft pick. The Jets chose him on the third round last spring.</p>
        <p>Since becoming a Jet, he has found a friend in Dwight Stone, the venerable special-teamer who has calmed things down when they got heated. Coles was benched in Game 2, the Monday night game against the Patriots at Giants Stadium. Coles complained publicly, but Stone told him that he had better learn how to play special teams and not think only of snatching touchdown passes.</p>
        <p>His work habits these days have impressed both Groh and Testaverde.</p>
        <p>Discussing Coles this past Saturday with the CBS commentator Phil Simms, Testaverde said: ''He and Marcus Coleman are two of the best athletes on our team. I'm very impressed at how hard he works. His speed makes it very hard to double him and Dedric.''</p>
        <p>In Coles's performance last Sunday at New England, he grabbed a Testaverde pass on third-and-9 and turned it into a 16-yard gain. There was also a 10-yard reception on the first scoring drive when he got between the Pro Bowl tandem of Lawyer Milloy and Ty Law. That was a third-and-4 conversion.</p>
        <p>''Was Vinny looking for him especially? No,'' Groh said. ''It's what I always say: Quarterbacks throw to who they see is open.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets and the Miami Dolphins are the only teams to hold every opponent to fewer than 21 points in each game. . . . The pass-rusher JOHN ABRAHAM, who sustained an abdominal muscle pull, leads American Football Conference rookies with 4 1/2 sacks. An M.R.I. performed this week was inconclusive. . . . Since the BILL PARCELLS reign began in 1997, and continuing this year with AL GROH, only three other teams in the National Football League have produced a better record than the Jets. They have a 34-20 mark since the first game of the 1997 season. Jacksonville, Minnesota and Denver have done better over the span. . . . Quick starts are nothing new to the Dolphins, but then neither are season-ending slumps. The Dolphins started 7-1 last year and then finished with a 9-7 record.</p>
