        <p>Sam O'Steen, a film editor whose work brought him three Academy Award nominations, died on Wednesday in Atlantic City. He was 76 and lived in New York.</p>
        <p>The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter Kathleen.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Steen became fascinated with filmmaking as a boy growing up in Burbank, Calif., and would regularly wangle his way onto the Warner Brothers lot in hopes of getting his foot in the door of an editing room.</p>
        <p>His first film was ''The Wrong Man'' (1957), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, on which he was an assistant editor. He wasn't credited as a full-fledged editor until 1964, when he worked on ''Robin and the Seven Hoods'' and ''Youngblood Hawke.''</p>
        <p>In addition to Hitchcock, Mr.  O'Steen worked with a number of other directors, including Alan J. Pakula and Roman Polanski. He edited both ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''Chinatown'' for Mr. Polanski and received an Oscar nomination for ''Chinatown.'' He received a second nomination for his work on Mike Nichols's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and a third for another Nichols film, ''Silkwood.'' In all, he edited nine of Mr. Nichols's films, including ''The Graduate,'' ''Catch-22'' and ''Carnal Knowledge.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Steen made his debut as a film director in 1976 with ''Sparkle.'' His television credits included ''Queen of the Stardust Ballroom,'' which he also directed and for which he received an Emmy nomination.</p>
        <p>In addition to his daughter Kathleen, he is survived by his wife, Bobbie, and three other daughters, Molly, Danielle and Wendy.</p>
