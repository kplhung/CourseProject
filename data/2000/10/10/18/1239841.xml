        <p>The hopes and fears of New York baseball fans are a reality.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will play the Mets in the city's first Subway Series since 1956, and the first ever between these two franchises, after the Yankees' wild pennant-clinching victory at Yankee Stadium early this morning.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees trailing the Seattle Mariners by 4-3 in the seventh inning, David Justice -- one of the team's many important additions during the regular season -- rocketed a three-run homer into the right-field stands for a 6-4 New York lead. Moments after the ball disappeared and the fans beckoned Justice for a curtain call, they began a chant: ''We want the Mets!'' Over and over: ''We want the Mets!''</p>
        <p>The Yankees added three more runs in the inning, and needed them all to hold off the Mariners in a 9-7 victory in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series and to win the four-of-seven-game series, four games to two.</p>
        <p>After falling deep into a slump at the end of the regular season, after nearly being eliminated by the Oakland Athletics in the division series, the Yankees will play in the World Series again, trying to become the first team since the 1972-74 Athletics to win three straight World Series titles.</p>
        <p>Either Andy Pettitte or Roger Clemens is expected to pitch for the Yankees against the Mets' Mike Hampton Saturday night at Yankee Stadium. Five boroughs will be watching. ''They've been looking for this matchup for a long time,'' Justice said. ''The Mets and the Yankees. New York is going to be on fire for the next week and a half.''</p>
        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre said, ''It's going to split a few families up, I think.''</p>
        <p>For six innings last night, it seemed the Yankees might be in jeopardy of being pushed to a Game 7 with the Mariners -- and perhaps out of the playoffs. Seattle took a 4-0 lead in the fourth inning against the Yankees' Orlando Hernandez, a stunning development, for El Duque had never lost in the postseason.</p>
        <p>The Yankees pieced together a three-run rally in the bottom of the fourth, and for the next two and a half innings, the two teams fended off rallies, Seattle's one-run advantage holding. Jose Paniagua took over in relief for Seattle in the seventh, and Jose Vizcaino was inserted as a pinch-hitter for Scott Brosius to lead off the inning for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Vizcaino topped a slow roller to the right side of the infield, just out of the reach of first baseman John Olerud. Second baseman Mark McLemore gloved the ball and threw to Paniagua covering the bag -- too late to get Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>He was the potential tying run and Chuck Knoblauch bunted him to second. Derek Jeter dribbled a grounder to the left side of the infield, the ball trickling between the shortstop and third baseman; Vizcaino, unsure of whether to stay at second or advance, rambled to third.</p>
        <p>With the left-handed-hitting Justice coming to bat, Seattle Manager Lou Piniella called for the left-hander Arthur Rhodes. When this series started, Justice had three hits in eight career at-bats against Rhodes, a hard thrower, and in the eighth inning of Game 2, Rhodes allowed a double to Justice to start a seven-run rally.</p>
        <p>Now it was Game 6, tying run at third, potential lead run at first. Justice stepped into the box, hoping to hit a sacrifice fly, ''to do anything to get that runner home from third. You got a guy there throwing 95 m.p.h., and I just didn't want to chase anything high. I've been having a problem doing that.''</p>
        <p>Justice took two pitches out of the strike zone, fouled off a pitch. Two balls and one strike. Rhodes fired a pitch that darted out of the strike zone and Justice tried to check his swing -- successfully, according to the third-base umpire, Mark Hirschbeck, who flattened his hands to signal safe, a call that drew screams from Piniella. It was a pivotal call, for now the count was three balls and one strike and Justice could confidently look for a fastball.''</p>
        <p>He was calm in this situation; Justice has played in more games in the postseason than any other player in baseball history, 88. ''He's lived in the postseason,'' Jeter said recently.</p>
        <p>Rhodes threw a fastball. Justice lifted his right foot, his timing mechanism, and it darted forward, like a cobra's head, his bat following. He absolutely killed the ball, the sound of contact unmistakable. He knew he had hit a home run.</p>
        <p>Jeter raised both arms, and several Yankees jumped from the dugout, the fans standing and jumping, the stands shaking. Justice turned toward first base and pumped his left arm, and afterward, he was near tears as he described how he looked into stands rounding second base and saw fans going crazy. ''I wish you all could've experienced that feeling,'' said Justice, gulping.</p>
        <p>Soon there was the chant -- ''We want the Mets!'' -- and the Yankees pounded away at Rhodes for three more runs, Paul O'Neill driving in the last two with a single, runs that seemed like chips and soda for the party. The Yankees led, 9-4, they were in full control.</p>
        <p>But nothing has been easy for this team, and it would not be a simple matter of getting the last six outs. Alex Rodriguez slammed a homer leading off the eighth to knock out El Duque, and even when Mariano Rivera came on, bearing his three-year scoreless streak, the Mariners continued to cut into the Yankees' lead. Mark McLemore ripped a two-run double, ending Rivera's record postseason streak at 33 1/3 innings. Yankees 9, Mariners 7, three outs to go.</p>
        <p>The one hitter who has hit Rivera harder than any other is Edgar Martinez, the Seattle designated hitter, who came into this series with 10 hits in 12 at-bats against him. Torre had tried to maneuver around that matchup, but as he waited for the ninth inning, he and the bench coach Don Zimmer fatalistically agreed that inevitably, Martinez would probably bat against Rivera in the ninth.</p>
        <p>Martinez was due to bat fourth in the inning, and Rivera retired the first two batters. But Rodriguez beat out an infield single and Martinez walked to the plate, the potential tying run.</p>
        <p>Rivera threw a fastball, Martinez hit a dribbler toward shortstop, where Jeter rushed in and threw to first, and when Tino Martinez caught the ball with his foot on the bag, Jeter leaped into the air. Catcher Jorge Posada hugged Rivera, Jeter ran up and body-slammed Rivera from behind, and they were American League champions again.</p>
        <p>Torre walked onto the field and the first player he saw was Rivera, who grinned at his manager, having put him through an emotional wringer in those last two innings. ''I knew it was going to come down to Martinez,'' said Torre, smiling.</p>
        <p>They sprayed Champagne, 15 cases of Moet, and hugged. They will enjoy this for a day, then focus on the Mets, their tough little brother franchise across the city, a resilient team they have faced during the regular season. A month ago, Paul O'Neill shook his head at the thought the Yankees might play the Mets in the World Series. ''I just couldn't handle that,'' he said. ''I just couldn't handle that. It would just be too much.''</p>
        <p>But now it's reality, the fulfillment of hopes and fears of players and fans alike.</p>
