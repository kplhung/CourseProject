        <p>BLAME FOR HIGH BILLS -- A consultant to the Independent System Operator, a group that administers the wholesale energy markets in New York State, yesterday attributed much of  the summer increase in electricity prices in the metropolitan area to the shutdown of a Con Edison generating plant. The consultant, David B. Patton of Capital Economics, challenged Con Edison's position that much of the increase resulted from the group's rules, which discourage economical imports of electricity. Mr. Patton said the shutdown of the Indian Point 2 power plant after an accident in February forced Con Ed to buy more expensive replacement power. A Con Ed spokesman, Joseph Petta, said the utility stood by its position.</p>

        <p>HEALTH CARE SPENDING RISES -- New York State had 6.7 percent of the nation's population in 1998 but 8.4 percent of its personal health care spending, a study by the state Conference of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans says. The study, released Monday, said part of the difference could be attributed to nonresidents' coming into the state for health care services. The study found that per capita health care spending in New York rose to $4,720 in 1998 from $2,454 in 1988, a 92 percent increase, compared with a nationwide rise to $3,760 from $2,033, an 85 percent increase.  Hospital care accounted for 35 percent of such spending in New York in 1998, the largest slice, while the services of doctors and other professionals accounted for 22 percent.</p>

        <p>REFUNDS COMING -- Verizon Communications has agreed to reimburse $1.5 million to 34,000 long-distance customers in New York State and pay $250,000 to the government under a consent decree. In March, the company and the Federal Communications Commission investigated the improper handling of electronic records used to confirm that a consumer has asked to switch long-distance carriers. They found that in some cases, a third party used to verify orders was given incorrect information by the Verizon representative or entered wrong information into its databases. Verizon said it would reimburse the customers for calls made while it dealt with its record-keeping errors.</p>
