        <p>Arab leaders, uneasy riders atop a wave of militant anti-Israel sentiment across the Middle East, began to regroup after the Sharm el Sheik summit meeting today in preparation for a weekend meeting of their own that will test regional support for a negotiated peace with Israel.</p>
        <p>The tone of the coming meeting in Cairo of Arab League heads of state -- the first such high-level conference in 10 years -- will largely depend on how Israelis and Palestinians respond to the agreement forged at their two-day meeting in the Egyptian resort town, said officials and experts around the region.</p>
        <p>''If the coming days bring no change from Israel, then the Arab summit will be under tremendous pressure to do something about the situation in the Palestinian territories,'' said Abdel Moneim Said, director of the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies here. ''This will also directly affect the Palestinian, Egyptian and Jordanian leaders' ability to sell any agreement to their people.''</p>
        <p>The American-guided meeting in Sharm el Sheik, sponsored by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, ended today with mixed results -- at least in the view of Arab leaders, who had hoped for a more resounding affirmation of Palestinian grievances.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, like the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, pledged to work toward stopping the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Mr. Arafat, bowing to pressure from the United States, abandoned his demand for a United Nations investigation into his charges that Israel has used excessive force in nearly three weeks of clashes with Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Concern that a disaffected Arab League could decide on a hard-line rejection of all dealings with Israel, bringing the region back to the hostile standoff that existed until the last few years, may lead to a new round of regional consultations.</p>
        <p>With the Arab meeting set to begin  Saturday, the principal leaders who could set the mood and lead the debate began consultations immediately after the Sharm el Sheik meeting.</p>
        <p>In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Abdullah met with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who was on a tour of the Persian Gulf states, before the Sharm el Sheik meeting ended. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright also flew immediately to Riyadh to brief the prince on the Sharm el Sheik results and to press for a restrained Arab response on regional relations with Israel.</p>
        <p>The fierce Palestinian-Israeli clashes will certainly be the central focus of the Arab League meeting,  which was specifically called to formulate a united Arab response to the situation.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, the assembled leaders of the 22-nation group are expected to make a declaration of solid Arab support for Mr. Arafat and for Palestinians. But events over the next few days could well determine how far beyond that axiomatic declaration the leaders are willing to go. Already, official statements from  Syria, Iraq and some conservative Persian Gulf states have lauded the Palestinian attacks on Israelis as a holy uprising that should not only continue but be accorded the Arab world's full backing.</p>
        <p>A number of Arab leaders, as well as Palestinian officials, have also openly questioned whether the triangular peace negotiations of the last seven years -- between Israel and the Palestinians with the United States as interlocuter -- ought to remain the model for future talks.</p>
        <p>A traditional Arab demand, before the direct Palestinian-Israeli negotiations began after the Oslo accord in 1993, has been for the United Nations to take the lead role. Israel, suspicious of the United Nations, has long opposed such a model.</p>
        <p>The strain of keeping the Arab League from abandoning support for Palestinian-Israeli peace talks is particularly acute for President Mubarak and for King Abdullah of Jordan. Theirs are the only Arab countries to maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel.</p>
        <p>With the signing of their peace treaties, both Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 were rewarded with enormous annual infusions of American aid money that bound them as never before to the United States. Both Mr. Mubarak and Jordan's king have staked their political credibility on pushing Mr. Arafat and Israel to negotiate instead of fight.</p>
        <p>Both leaders -- the only Arab heads of state who attended the Sharm el Sheik meeting -- have been trying to show empathy with the outpouring of popular anger on behalf of the Palestinians and at the same time to accommodate American pressure to maintain relations with Israel.</p>
        <p>''The majority of our population is of Palestinian origin and is linked to what is happening in Palestine,'' said Taher al Masri, a former Jordanian prime minister whose family roots are in the West Bank. ''Those factors have forced the king to take a balanced position to the situation. He really had to go closely in support of Palestinians and Palestinian demands, without at the same time affecting our treaty and relations with Israel.''</p>
        <p>Demonstrations against Israel and the United States have been especially furious in Jordan and in Egypt.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia could also play a moderating role at the Arab summit meeting if the situation in the Palestinian territories stabilizes quickly.</p>
        <p>The crown prince, who has been effectively running his country during the illness of his brother, King Fahd, has taken a more active and public role in Arab diplomacy than any of his predecessors. He has been harshly critical of Israel and has issued vague warnings that Saudi Arabia would react if Israel continued to battle Palestinians.</p>
        <p>But, like other Saudi leaders before him, he also has shown little interest in involving Saudi Arabia directly in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, except to insist that neither he nor any other Muslim leader will accept any final deal that does not give sovereignty over East Jerusalem to the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>If asked to take a position one way or the other on the specifics of how or if the Palestinians should talk to Israel, he may abstain. ''He will say, go and do what you want and don't involve me,'' said Muhammad Salahuddin, a veteran Saudi political analyst and magazine publisher.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia, however, will be a leading force in rejecting any attempt to finesse the core issue of East Jerusalem, where Palestinians have demanded full sovereignty.</p>
        <p>''The crown prince has explicitly said lately that no one whatsoever can dare to surrender one inch of Jerusalem,'' Mr. Salahuddin said, adding that any agreement that dilutes Arab control of the city would expose Arab governments to dangerous domestic problems.</p>
