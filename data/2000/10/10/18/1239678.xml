        <p>Uganda rejects Sudan's claim that its defeat for a Security Council seat occurred because the United States browbeat or paid off African delegates (World Briefing item, Oct. 13).</p>
        <p>Uganda does not need to be bought to oppose Sudan-based terrorists who are killing innocent people in our capital. Nor does it need to be bought to oppose a country that harbors terrorist groups that have abducted thousands of Ugandan children. The presidents of Iran, Malawi and Kenya, as well as former President Jimmy Carter, have brokered peace agreements that Sudan never observed.</p>

        <p>In September, Sudan signed an agreement committing itself to return Uganda's children. Let Sudan adopt a policy of good-neighborliness. Let the Sudanese improve their human rights record.</p>
