        <p>In the first act of ''Stranger,'' Craig Lucas's bleak and crudely drawn new play at the Vineyard Theater, Mr. Strathairn spends close to an hour held captive in an airplane by a seat belt and a loquacious fellow passenger.

        <p>Few theater actors working today find the sounds in silence that David Strathairn does. Give him a stage and a character with a reason to be quiet and he'll highjack your attention, no matter what kind of noise is going on around him.</p>
        <p>In the first act of ''Stranger,'' Craig Lucas's bleak and crudely drawn new play at the Vineyard Theater, Mr. Strathairn spends close to an hour held captive in an airplane by a seat belt and a loquacious fellow passenger. He scarcely moves and he doesn't talk much. But, boy, does he manage to say a lot.</p>
        <p>As a young woman later tells his character, who has the too-resonant name of Hush, ''Some people just have something -- crackling, like a power station.'' With nary a vulgar tremor or twitch, Mr. Strathairn  does indeed send off electric waves that hint at some strenuously contained black force. His very soft-spokenness becomes a danger sign. He's a monument to willed passivity, a gentle giant acutely aware of his capacity to harm.</p>
        <p>Now does this description make you shirk or salivate? To some people, strong, silent and potentially pathological definitely reads as sexy, a fact of life that Mr. Lucas has bravely chosen to explore in ''Stranger.''</p>
        <p>Even more bravely the ever-questing author of ''Prelude to a Kiss'' and ''The Dying Gaul'' here presents an extreme portrait of a couple that suggests that at the heart of all relationships are the urges to torture and be hurt. Whatever role you chose, it seems, there is fear and loathing in love, much of it self-directed.</p>
        <p>Given this harsh (if less than original) premise, watching ''Stranger,'' which opened last night under Mark Brokaw's direction, should be a far more unsettling experience than it turns out to be. Despite the fine performance of Mr. Strathairn and some vibrant work from Kyra Sedgwick as his wounding and woundable female counterpart, the play feels flat and dismally free of tension.</p>
        <p>It doesn't even compel as the sort of tabloid police-blotter tale on which ''Stranger'' is a variation. And what should be a tantalizing series of nasty teases in plotting registers instead as a premapped, much-traveled path.</p>
        <p>This is all the more disappointing in light of the harrowing impact of Mr. Lucas's last drama, ''The Dying Gaul,'' also produced at the Vineyard and directed by Mr. Brokaw. In that work Mr. Lucas presented a knot of sexual relationships with a darkness that went far beyond cynical. It was in a sense the anti-''Angels in America,'' portraying grief and anger in the age of AIDS as a source of psychic pollution instead of ennoblement.</p>
        <p>Some critics hated ''Gaul,'' but it had a fierceness and energy rarely found in the theater anymore and it definitely got people talking. It also represented a major creative leap for Mr. Lucas from the gentler, rueful whimsy best embodied by ''Prelude'' to a dynamic take-no-prisoners aggression. And while ''Gaul'' would have seemed to puncture credibility with any number of outlandish plot devices, its violent, vitriolic imagination kept you involved and kept you guessing.</p>
        <p>''Stranger'' is even heavier on improbable story mechanics, and you are always aware of this burdensome weight. I won't be so ungallant as to give away the story's all-informing central event, but its like has been used before to more lurid effect by novelists, dramatists and filmmakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucas has said he was inspired by a newspaper account of a crime, and you can understand his fascination with the subject. But in translating it to the stage he has become overly obsessed with certain logistics of plot that require lengthy, ultimately tedious explanations by the two leading characters.</p>
        <p>They are Mr. Strathairn's laconic Hush and Ms. Sedgwick's garrulous Linda, who meet on an airplane in the play's opening seconds and wind up in a remote woodland cabin for the second act. Hush and Linda both have secrets, of course, which get spilled -- at least partly -- in the way of confidences between traveling strangers. These exchanges are laden with observations from Hush, a born-again Christian, on the battle of God and Satan for the soul and from Linda on the natural human urge to humiliate others.</p>
        <p>The evening's essential questions are all laid out early and, if you listen hard, so are the answers. The production, which features the attractive young actors David Harbour and Julianne Nicholson in assorted supporting roles, never takes that wild speculative jump that made ''Gaul'' so exciting. It keeps hoeing the same ground without digging deeper, and the usually inventive Mr. Brokaw just lets the story plod along.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sedgwick, a natural and vivid stage actress, has a virtuosic vitality that keeps you watching, but this doesn't disguise her being essentially miscast. She never seems, as she has to, like irreparably damaged goods.</p>
        <p>Students of acting are nonetheless urged to check out ''Stranger'' to see what Mr. Strathairn achieves with minimal words and gestures. Watch his eyes, particularly in a second-act flashback when you see Hush acting out a scene he has previously described. You hear what he's hearing in the silence. Indeed, the excessively talkative ''Stranger'' is never stronger than when it has the good sense to be quiet.</p>
