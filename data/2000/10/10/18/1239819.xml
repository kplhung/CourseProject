        <p>When it made its debut five years ago, ''Xena: Warrior Princess,'' a syndicated program about a leather-clad, towering, fantasy-age female warrior, provoked plenty of guffaws inside and outside the television industry. In large part the laughter was directed at the underlying sexual tension that seems to run through the series, which is geared for teenagers and young adults. (Its action sequences are often good for a laugh, too.)</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the program became a phenomenon.</p>
        <p>It consistently did well in the ratings, finishing first among first-run, syndicated dramas the last four years. And the popularity of its protagonist, Xena, played by Lucy Lawless, was an augury for the coming popularity of other very big people on television (professional wrestlers).</p>
        <p>But its syndicator, Studios USA Domestic Television, has announced that it is ending production of the series at the end of this television season, effectively ending an era.</p>
        <p>Executives there said they were doing so in large part because of major changes in the television world. Though the program could easily be shown on independent stations in prime time when it made its debut, the continued spread of the WB and UPN networks to independent stations has made things more difficult. Each of those networks has its own prime-time schedule, so there became fewer of the more profitable, nightly slots in which the Xenas of the world could be shown. Many stations moved it to more remote time periods.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't paying off,'' a spokesman for Studios USA said sadly.</p>
        <p>''If every station came back to us tomorrow and said. 'We'll put you back in prime time because we don't want the show to go away,' we would reconsider.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, he said, there has been no such luck.</p>
