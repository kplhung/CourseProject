        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>SHUNNED CANDIDATE SPEAKS OUT -- Just as Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, was not permitted to join the two major-party candidates in last night's presidential debate in Missouri, so Jeff Gates, also a Green Party candidate, was not permitted to join the two major-party candidates in the Senate debate in Georgia on Monday.</p>
        <p>But unlike Mr. Nader, Mr. Gates decided not merely to grumble and sue.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the debate in Albany between Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat, and former Senator Mack Mattingly, a Republican, Mr. Gates stood up and demanded to be included, shouting: ''This is what democracy looks like. This is what democracy feels like.''</p>
        <p>The outburst, broadcast on statewide television, prompted a police officer to handcuff Mr. Gates and hustle him out of Albany Municipal Auditorium. He was charged with disorderly conduct and spent much of the rest of the night in jail before being released after posting a $181 bond.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>HIGH-TECHNOLOGY POLITICS -- Both parties have aggressively courted the computer industry this year, with Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman arguing that they are the ticket with the best understanding of the new, high-technology economy and its needs. Mr. Gore even took some controversial credit at one point for helping develop the Internet.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, he and Mr. Lieberman got some solid support yesterday when 400 of the industry's leaders endorsed them.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be here without Al Gore having done everything he's done in the last 25 years,'' said one of the most prominent in the group, Marc Andreessen, a founder of Netscape.</p>

        <p>THE BALLOT QUESTIONS</p>
        <p>DEVELOPMENT ON COLORADO BALLOT -- Among all the choices Colorado voters have next month, nothing has stirred passions more than a ballot initiative that would require local governments to put development plans before voters each year.</p>
        <p>Recent polls show that a majority of Coloradans favor the measure. But record amounts of money are pouring in to fight it, with the opposition group, Coloradans for Responsible Reform, raising $5.1 million. That is more than eight times the $633,000 that initiative supporters have raised.</p>
        <p>The bankers, builders and real estate developers who oppose the initiative say it would curb the supply of affordable housing units and stunt a booming economy. But the Sierra Club and other environmental groups  contend that without stricter oversight, new development will overwhelm roads, schools and other government services.</p>

        <p>THE ELECTORATE</p>
        <p>THE VOTERS ARE CHATTING -- Maybe the voters have not really vanished. Maybe they were just a bit slow to take interest.</p>
        <p>Harvard University's Vanishing Voter research project, which seeks to understand how to get more of the American electorate involved in politics, got some encouraging results in its latest poll, conducted last week. Nearly half of adults reported having discussed the campaign with someone within the past 24 hours.</p>
        <p>The project had previously found that, on average, only about 22 percent of adults said they had talked with someone about the campaign within the past 24 hours. But once the presidential debates started, that figure quickly more than doubled.</p>
