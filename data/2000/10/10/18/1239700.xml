        <p>DOUGHNUTS show up in all sorts of places in New York: restaurants, diners and bakeries. Here are some of the places where they are made with care. The best, like those made at Gramercy Tavern, Il Forno and Eli's Manhattan, are worth a detour.</p>
        <p>CUPCAKE CAFE, 522 Ninth Avenue (39th Street). One of the best cake doughnuts around, with flavors like buttermilk and whole wheat orange. They are dense and caky, but not too dry if you buy them early in the morning; 60 cents each; $5.40 a dozen.</p>

        <p>DOUGHNUTS show up in all sorts of places in New York: restaurants, diners and bakeries. Here are some of the places where they are made with care. The best, like those made at Gramercy Tavern, Il Forno and Eli's Manhattan, are worth a detour.</p>
        <p>CUPCAKE CAFE, 522 Ninth Avenue (39th Street). One of the best cake doughnuts around, with flavors like buttermilk and whole wheat orange. They are dense and caky, but not too dry if you buy them early in the morning; 60 cents each; $5.40 a dozen.</p>
        <p>S.G.S. DONUTS, 254 Eighth Avenue (23rd Street). The honey-dipped and sugar-coated yeast doughnuts are made twice a day, at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. They are pleasantly chewy and have an almost creamy yeast flavor. Other flavors are drowned in stodgy glazes; avoid them; 60 cents each.</p>
        <p>DOUGHNUT PLANT, 379 Grand Street (Norfolk Street). These are huge, chewy masses of rich yeasty dough. One could last you all week. They are made with good butter and milk and coated with everything from pistachio glaze to strawberry to Valrhona chocolate; $1.75 each.</p>
        <p>ELI'S MANHATTAN, 1411 Third Avenue (80th Street). A terrific jelly-filled doughnut, with dough as light as a feather and not very sweet, a perfect counterpoint to the filling. The chocolate-coated yeast doughnut is also excellent, with bittersweet chocolate and a dense, springy texture; $1.50 each.</p>
        <p>GOOD, 89 Greenwich Avenue (Bank Street). A very dense, fragrant sour cream orange cake doughnut is served with Mexican hot chocolate for dessert. They are warm, which makes them irresistible and dangerous; $5 for two with hot chocolate; 2 for $3 at brunch.</p>
        <p>GRAMERCY TAVERN, 42 East 20th Street. The beignets are round little puffs of dough -- bonbons among doughnuts -- delivered to the table warm. They are technically a different sort of pastry, but with their squishy interior and crisp sugar-coated exterior, who's going to quibble? A baker's dozen for $11.</p>
        <p>IL FORNO, 400 West 50th Street. Bomboloni as puffy as throw pillows, and almost as big. A tender dough, crispy on the outside, with a generous stuffing of fresh, eggy custard. Delicious, but they may sink you. Plain doughnuts make a lighter alternative. Bomboloni, $1.75; plain doughnuts, $1.50.</p>
        <p>OSTERIA DEL CIRCO, 120 West 55th Street. Little round bomboloni filled with jelly, chocolate or pastry cream are served at the bar. The dough is incredibly light, with the thin, crisp crust a touch oily, but pleasantly so. Three for $9.</p>
        <p>STEINWAY BAKE SHOP, 2808 Steinway Street (28th Avenue), Astoria, Queens. The cream-filled doughnuts are as heavy as a shoe, and it's a good thing, because the cream is so delicious you want plenty of it. The exterior is sturdy and has a hint of sweetness. The plain doughnuts live up to the description; 60 to 70 cents each.</p>
