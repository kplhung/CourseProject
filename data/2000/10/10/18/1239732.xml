        <p>Restored Sculptures Back on View</p>
        <p>In 1852, five years after its founding as the Free Academy, City College was given a large gift of 24 casts of marble sculptures in the Parthenon in Athens. Generations of City College art students have fixed their gazes on Dionysus and other Greek figures. Four years ago, the pieces were judged to need repair and were placed in storage.  Now the college is lending most of the casts for 5 to 10 years to the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation (USA), which paid for the repairs. The foundation will display the works in the lobby of Olympic Tower on Fifth Avenue starting next week to celebrate the foundation's establishment in the United States.</p>

        <p>Restored Sculptures Back on View</p>
        <p>In 1852, five years after its founding as the Free Academy, City College was given a large gift of 24 casts of marble sculptures in the Parthenon in Athens. Generations of City College art students have fixed their gazes on Dionysus and other Greek figures. Four years ago, the pieces were judged to need repair and were placed in storage.  Now the college is lending most of the casts for 5 to 10 years to the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation (USA), which paid for the repairs. The foundation will display the works in the lobby of Olympic Tower on Fifth Avenue starting next week to celebrate the foundation's establishment in the United States.</p>
        <p>Two of the restored pieces will be displayed at the college, probably in the library; the rest are eventually to be reinstalled in the art department. The college and the foundation will also sponsor seminars organized by HARRIET SENIE, director of the college's master's degree program in museum studies.</p>
        <p>Prodding on Contract Talks</p>
        <p>RANDI WEINGARTEN, president of the United Federation of Teachers, has written a  stern letter to city and school officials, accusing them of dragging their heels in getting contract talks under way. The teachers'  contract expires next month, and on Sept. 6, Ms. Weingarten presented the union's demands for a new one to HAROLD O. LEVY, the school chancellor, and to JAMES HANLEY, the city labor commissioner. But a second meeting has not been scheduled. In her letter, dated Oct. 6, she warned that union lawyers would ''take whatever actions are appropriate to protect the rights of our members'' if she did not receive the city's counteroffer by Saturday. Their most likely step would be to file a complaint with the state's Public Employee Relations Board.</p>
        <p>New President at Pace</p>
        <p>DAVID A. CAPUTO, the former president of Hunter College, is to be installed as Pace University's sixth president this morning. A brass quintet featuring members of the Westchester Philharmonic and JENNIFER HO, a Pace Law School student and violinist, will be among those performing at the ceremony, which is to be held under a tent on the campus in Pleasantville and broadcast on Pace's Web site, www.pace.edu.</p>
        <p>Taking Over a Foundation</p>
        <p>After 12 years as president of Cooper Union, JOHN JAY ISELIN has moved to Columbia University to become president of the Marconi International Fellowship Foundation. Established 26 years ago in memory of Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of wireless communication, the foundation honors innovators in telecommunications and information technology. Mr. Iselin, who was also president for 16 years of Channel 13, WNET, hopes to explore the connections between modern telecommunications and public education.</p>
        <p>For Encouraging Minority Students</p>
        <p>A City College chemistry professor has been honored with a Presidential Award from the National Science Foundation for his work encouraging minority students to pursue science careers. The awards, established by President Clinton in 1996, recognize efforts to mentor young people entering science, math, and engineering, and include a $10,000 grant to continue mentoring programs. DANIEL L. AKINS, the recipient, is the director of the Center for Analysis of Structures and Interfaces.</p>
