        <p>PATEL-Mahendra, MD. With a profound sense of loss, we mourn the passing of our good friend and colleague, Mahendra Patel, MD. As an outstanding physician, he treated so many patients with compassion and humility; as an exceptional educator, he taught countless residents and medical students, and us all, with kindness and insight; as a beloved friend, he inspired us with his unending courage and optimism. To his beloved wife, Suli, and children Lipi and Anshul, we want you to know that your pain is our pain. We will miss terribly Mahendra's gentleness and sensitivity, his smile and good humor, his sense of professionalism and mentorship, his wit and wisdom, his nobility and character. His memory will live on for eternity in the endeavors of his students. Mitchell A. Goldman, MD, Chairman, Dept. Radiology Jay Cinnamon, MD, Vice-Chairman, Dept.
