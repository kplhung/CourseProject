        <p>I started with AT&amp;T over 20 years ago, before the breakup, and have since worked for several of the spinoffs. Working for communications companies means that I have drawn mostly phones or phone switches, or diagrams showing how to use them.</p>
        <p>I also produce slides or overheads for marketing presentations for customers, or for people to use when they give talks within the company. I do a lot of artwork for our internal and external Web sites, too.</p>

        <p>I started with AT&amp;T over 20 years ago, before the breakup, and have since worked for several of the spinoffs. Working for communications companies means that I have drawn mostly phones or phone switches, or diagrams showing how to use them.</p>
        <p>I also produce slides or overheads for marketing presentations for customers, or for people to use when they give talks within the company. I do a lot of artwork for our internal and external Web sites, too.</p>
        <p>The strangest request I ever received was to help another graphic artist create two 8-foot illustrations of flying frogs wearing capes and then drive them from central New Jersey to Great Gorge for a big executive multimedia presentation. The theme was ''Leapfrogging Into the Future.'' It was a rah-rah meeting to get everybody pumped up about the future of the company. On the way we had to stop at a wholesale toy distributor and get 50 inflatable frogs to float in the pool.</p>
        <p>In the old days, it was not uncommon to work around the clock to complete a project on time. Once I had a rush presentation that I apparently didn't check very well -- one slide had a picture of a clock that was noticeably backwards when the client displayed it on a three-foot projection screen.</p>
        <p>One of the top executives here likes to make last-minute changes to his slide presentations, which is very frustrating when a laptop or disk has to be shipped ahead of time to a foreign country where he's giving a talk. On one occasion, customs wouldn't let the zip disk through. Some countries have a thing about admitting electronic information they can't read. We were in a total panic trying to get the slide presentation into the country. Eventually we broke the talk into sections and e-mailed the files one by one.</p>
        <p>Another time an executive threatened my job if I didn't stay all day on a Saturday to finish his slide presentation. I didn't argue with him. I found out later that the party I was supposed to go to that day, which I missed, was a surprise engagement party for my fiance and me.</p>
        <p>Some of my daily frustrations are the equipment breaking down after I've told a client I'll have something to him in five minutes. Or I'll send someone a graphic that he has to have immediately and he can't open the file and I have no idea why. The art department is usually the last part of the chain in any project, and I'm given next to no time to do my part.</p>
        <p>Some days I spend all day doing nothing and at 4 p.m. I'll get a bunch of e-mails and calls that have me working overtime. Again, people don't think of the art department until the last minute, and most clients probably think they can explain something and I can do it on a computer in a few minutes.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working with marketing people, I work mostly with engineers, and this is a generalization, but they have fairly bad handwriting. It can be frustrating to try to decipher stacks of handwritten drawings an engineer has left me, especially when there are engineering terms I'm not familiar with. Engineers are also perfectionists. If an engineer tells me a word would look better 1/16  of an inch to the left, I move it. It's just easier that way.</p>
