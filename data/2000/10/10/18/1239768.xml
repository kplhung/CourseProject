        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani expressed hope yesterday that the city could complete negotiations for construction of a new Ebbets Field-style ballpark next to Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, as soon as the season is over, we'll be able to get that arranged and work out a new ballpark for the Mets,'' Giuliani said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>The mayor's remark, coming amid the euphoria that followed the Mets' National League championship victory on Monday, followed three weeks of uncertainly over the plan for a new Mets stadium to replace the 37-year-old Shea.  Although Mets officials first proposed the new ball field in 1998, one of the team's co-owners, Nelson Doubleday, told The Associated Press in late September that he was not satisfied with the amount of financial assistance being offered by the city and was leaning toward renovating Shea.</p>
        <p>But the Mets' other owner, Fred Wilpon, who is heading the team's negotiations with the city, was quoted by The Daily News yesterday as saying that bargaining had progressed, and that a formal announcement of the new stadium might be made during the World Series. The Mets have said their plan is to demolish Shea to make room for parking once the new stadium, which may have a retractable dome, is completed.</p>
        <p>Giuliani said yesterday that he had discussed the plan with Mets officials in their offices at Shea before the game on Monday night.</p>
        <p>''I think they know the parameters of what the city can do, and where the city needs help,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The mayor has proposed that the Mets stadium, expected to cost $500 million, be paid for in an even three-way split by the city, the state and the Mets organization. He did not comment yesterday on financing, but said, ''we are very interested in trying to make a deal.''</p>
