        <p>No one looking at her would ever guess that Eileen Barton has a food obsession. She seems so utterly normal: a part-time administrative assistant at her church, Crosspointe Church at Cary, N.C., part-time freelance writer and a conservatively dressed mother of a 12-year-old boy. She is a woman whose calm demeanor indicates a life that is balanced and in control.</p>
        <p>At a recent dinner at an Italian restaurant in Raleigh, N.C., Ms. Barton spent no time thinking out loud about what to eat. With little ado, she had a tossed salad, a glass of wine, monkfish, one slice of bread and, after her plate was cleared, one cup of decaffeinated coffee. It was almost unconscious for her to refrain from the appetizers, to abstain from the dessert, to keep her hands out of the bread basket.</p>
        <p>But eating, for Ms. Barton, is anything but impulsive. She is acutely aware of what she is eating, privately contemplating what to eat, how much to eat, and whether she has had too much to eat. She weighs herself to make sure that her weight never exceeds 145 pounds on her 5 foot 7 frame, she exercises every day, and she dreams of losing those 5 to 10 pounds that she believes would make such a difference in her appearance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barton is the chronic dieter. Food, her weight, her exercise program, she says, are ''always on my mind.''</p>
        <p>A recent national survey of 107,804 adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that more than two-thirds of Americans, 64 percent of men and 78 percent of women, are either dieting to lose weight or watching what they eat to prevent themselves from gaining weight.</p>
        <p>Not all are as skillful as Ms. Barton. Dr. Mary K. Serdula, who led the survey, said many tried to control their weight by controlling their fat intake, a strategy that Dr. Serdula and other experts said was ineffective. Or they fail to exercise. But Dr. Serdula said she was not at all surprised that so many Americans wee trying so hard to keep their weight under control.</p>
        <p>''Weight is a big concern in America,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Until recently, obesity experts would have wrung their hands in dismay over such statistics. Chronic dieters, they would have said, either have eating disorders or are on their way to developing them.</p>
        <p>Now, however, increasing numbers of experts say that view is woefully wrong. In today's society, where ever greater varieties of food, in larger and larger portions, always beckon, these experts have concluded that the only way for most people to control their weight is to be like Ms. Barton, exquisitely aware of food, planning their eating and planning exercise to burn off calories and never letting a day go by when what to eat and how much to eat and how much to exercise is not on their minds.</p>
        <p>''How many people eat because they're hungry?'' asks Dr. James Hill, an obesity researcher at the University of Colorado  Health Science Center in Denver. ''We eat because it's 12 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>While there are what Dr. Hill calls ''the genetic superstars'' who are naturally thin and who naturally stop eating when their body tells them they have had enough, ''the data suggests that they are in the minority,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''The only way to keep from gaining weight is to make gaining weight a conscious activity rather than an unconscious activity,'' Dr. Hill said. ''If you leave it to your physiology, you're going to gain weight. You have to plan.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Madelyn H. Fernstrom, director of the weight management center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System, put it bluntly: ''The term 'chronic dieter' is not a negative one.''</p>
        <p>And, Dr. Hill added, it is the responsibility of obesity researchers to tell the public that they really do have to think about food and exercise all the time.</p>
        <p>Ever Vigilant on Regimens</p>
        <p>For years, the great hope and promise of diet programs had been to get people's weight down and then allow them to, in essence, forget about food, living the rest of their lives like someone who was naturally thin.</p>
        <p>''That was the meta-message. You go on a diet for short period of time and then the diet's over,'' said Dr. Gary D. Foster, who is the clinical director of the Weight and Eating Disorders Program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>If only it were so simple, chronic dieters say.</p>
        <p>Mary Litman began dieting years ago, when she was 20. She remembers the moment she resolved to lose weight, at the end of a date with a good-looking young man.</p>
        <p>He walked her to her door, she recalled, and said, ''It's a good thing you have a pretty face because you're really fat.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Litman was 5 foot 2 and weighed 125 pounds. Her date was right, she decided. All that oblivious eating of cakes and pies that her mother, a farmer's wife, had made for the family had taken their toll.</p>
        <p>''I was farm-girl fat -- pretty, but chubby,'' Ms. Litman said.</p>
        <p>She began a life of dieting, first losing about 10 pounds, then learning to maintain it. She walks at least four miles a day, makes deliberate food choices and bargains with herself in a constant internal conversation.</p>
        <p>The other day, for example, one of the women in her office at the University of Pittsburgh Health System, where she is an administrative coordinator, brought in homemade cannoli.</p>
        <p>''I said to myself, 'I'm going to eat it,' '' Ms. Litman declared. But then, she told herself, ''If you do, you have to walk home from work and eat a salad for dinner.'' Which is exactly what she did.</p>
        <p>She plans ways to keep her portions small. ''If I buy a pound of grapes and leave them in a big package, I'll eat every one of them,'' she said. ''If I put them in baggies, I'll eat what's in a baggie.'' When she wants mint candy, she buys Junior Mints rather than a large mint patty and eats a few at a time. ''If you buy a mint patty, it's gone,'' Ms. Litman said.</p>
        <p>Others have more extreme regimens.</p>
        <p>''I've been in pretty good shape now for decades,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman, who directs the clinical research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''But it's only because of being concerned every day with what I eat and what I burn up.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Wurtman, who describes himself as a fat person in a thin person's body, says he is so concerned about getting his aerobic exercise every day that he calls hotels before he visits them when he travels to make sure they have stair-stepping machines.</p>
        <p>''There's one hotel in Paris that I've gone to for 15 years because they had the only StairMaster in town,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also keeps a mental tally of the calories he consumes each day, aiming for a total of about 2,000. Breakfast is always grapefruit juice, black coffee and a bran muffin made by his wife, Dr. Judith Wurtman, who directs Triad, a commercial weight-loss center in Belmont, Mass. No bakery muffins for the Wurtmans. They can have 600 calories, Dr. Wurtman said.</p>
        <p>Lunch for Dr. Wurtman is either a cup of soup or nothing at all, unless he has a visitor and goes out to eat. ''Then I compensate later,'' he said, eating less for the rest of the day. After work, Dr. Wurtman has ''a dab of cottage cheese -- we buy the fat-free kind -- and I pour some soy sauce on it to make it taste good.'' Then he goes to the gym. After working out, he and his wife have dinner. ''It's very spartan -- fish and lots of vegetables and good bread.'' For dessert, he gets a treat -- some frozen yogurt.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be fat,'' Dr. Wurtman said. ''I don't want my clothes to be tight on me. I like the sense of looking in a mirror and not being displeased.''</p>
        <p>Control, a Relative Term</p>
        <p>In a sense, Ms. Barton, Ms. Litman and Dr. Wurtman are lucky. With chronic dieting, they have learned to stay thin. Not everyone is able to do so, obesity researchers say. Some are simply misinformed about how to do it. Others are biologically unable to become thin -- the most they can realistically hope for is to be less fat.</p>
        <p>In recent years, an ever-accumulating body of evidence has led most obesity researchers to a troubling conclusion: except within certain narrow limits, people may  not be able to control their weight completely. Each individual, they say, inherits genes that predetermine a range of body weights -- varying about 10 percent from a midpoint, that they can maintain. The chronic dieters, through their constant vigilance, are keeping their weights as low as their genes will allow. The notion of natural weight ranges can be hard for many people to accept, obesity experts say. The idea that anyone who wants to could be thin, is ''the biggest misunderstanding in medicine,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hirsch and others point out that years of research consistently show that if someone's weight gets out of her genetically determined range -- either because she has managed to eat so much that she becomes fatter or because she diets so much that she becomes thinner -- her body is driven to lose or gain weight to force her weight back in line. Those who are above their range lose their appetites and lose interest in food. At the same time, their body's metabolism actually speeds up to push their weight back down. Those who are below their range become obsessed with food and unable to control their urges to eat. In that situation, the body's metabolism slows down to make the pounds creep back on, researchers find.</p>
        <p>That, of course, does not mean that environment plays no role in making people grow fat. After all, researchers add, genes cannot change overnight, but environments can. And something must be making people gain weight. Many experts say that more and more Americans are responding to a society that insidiously encourages them to be as fat as their genes will allow them to be. Instead of being at the bottom of their weight range, like the chronic dieters, many people are at the top.</p>
        <p>But what is it that tempts people to eat so much? Hypotheses abound.</p>
        <p>''Portion sizes are enormous,'' said Dr. F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, a professor of medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. ''People are walking around with liter cups of milkshakes. And people nibble all the time. They're eating on the street, they're eating all night while they watch television.''</p>
        <p>Americans are eating more and more meals away from home, too. Fast foods are notoriously fattening. But expensive restaurants, too, have been known to ladle on the fat, knowing it makes their food taste good.</p>
        <p>Mashed potatoes at luxury restaurants may contain one part butter to two parts potatoes and even vegetables often get a tablespoon of butter per serving added on their way out of the kitchen. At Union Pacific, a Manhattan restaurant, the menu correctly said that its halibut was poached, but it did not say in what. The answer, said the proprietor and chef, Rocco DiSpirito, was goose fat.</p>
        <p>''Fat is an important element of flavor,'' Mr. DiSpirito explained.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jeffrey M. Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University, likes to explain weight ranges by analogy with height. With height, he said, people -- and animals -- are pretty much at the mercy of their inheritance, but the environment can -- and does -- make a big difference. After all, he said, the average height of soldiers during the Civil War was 5 foot 4. But while diet can make people grow taller, the upper and lower limits of an individual's height is  set by genes. The same may be true with weight, Dr. Friedman said.</p>
        <p>''There's an illusion that you can control weight,'' he said, ''but the facts don't support that.''</p>
        <p>Expectations vs. Reality</p>
        <p>Researchers who have seen what they describe as overwhelming evidence of biologically determined weight ranges say they are becoming weary of hearing promoters of weight-loss programs insist that people could be really thin if they truly wanted to.</p>
        <p>''They insist that if you would just eat less,'' Dr. Hirsch said. ''How many calories would it take? Come on, a mouthful less a day. Can't you do that,'' he said, adding,  ''Everyone wants to focus on the behavior side, as though people are perversely eating one bite more.''</p>
        <p>But behavior has failed to explain why people stay fat, Dr. Hirsch and others say. Studies searching for behavioral characteristics, like binge eating, eating too quickly or skipping meals that typified obesity failed to find consistent patterns. Every behavior by fat people was found just as often in thin people.</p>
        <p>It is a lesson that has been met with denial or disbelief, even by some who run research programs on obesity. These experts say that until recently they would point to height-weight charts and tell fat people that their goal should be to get to what the chart said was an optimal weight for their height. Only a few got their weights down that low and even fewer could maintain them. Now, these researchers say, they are citing what is a more realistic weight goal -- a loss of about 10 percent of body weight, which often is enough to make people healthier, lowering their blood sugar and blood pressure.</p>
        <p>But such modest goals are not always  easy for fat people to accept, Dr. Foster said. Achieving them requires great effort -- and constant vigilance for life -- but it also means coming to terms with the fact that, for many, being slender will always be a fantasy.</p>
        <p>In a recent study, Dr. Foster and his colleagues asked 60 obese women to reveal what they hoped for, and what they dreamed of, when they began a diet and exercise program. The women, whose average weight was 218 pounds, said their goal was to lose, on average, about a third of their body weight, or 71 pounds for a new weight of 146 pounds. They said that their dream would be to get down to 135 pounds.</p>
        <p>But after 48 weeks of diet and exercise, their average weight loss was just 37 pounds, a loss that they had described before the study as ''disappointing and could not be viewed as successful in any way.'' And that was before they tried to maintain what they had lost.</p>
        <p>Obesity experts say that many fat people will have to lower their expectations and realize that they can look and feel better even though they will not be thin.</p>
        <p>''Most of us have a little bit of an unrealistic idea of what we should look like,'' said Cathy Monas, the director of the weight management and nutrition center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Monas reminds patients of how much better their lives are with even a small but sustainable weight loss. ''We say, 'Look, you're maintaining your weight. Your blood pressure has gone down, your cholesterol has gone down, you're playing tennis again. This is terrific.' ''</p>
        <p>That, of course, is not the message that many fat people want to hear.</p>
        <p>Dr. Foster says he tries to explain to patients that they must be realistic. But, he said, ''when you tell a woman who weighs 220 pounds that she has to lose 22 pounds, she looks at you like you've got three heads.''</p>
        <p>Planning Diet and Exercise</p>
        <p>Dr. Fernstrom says she is still dumbfounded when she sees what many do to try to lose weight. Over and over again, she says, her patients will tell her they drank fruit juice with abandon or ate bags of fat-free pretzels, reasoning that because these foods had no fat, they are not fattening.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I call it the great hope of American eating, that nonfat means non caloric,'' Dr. Fernstrom said. ''This has been a sabotage.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Serdula of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the same thing in the national survey she directed. About 35 percent of the men and 40 percent of the women who were trying to lose weight said they were controlling their food intake by eating less fat. That simply does not work, Dr. Serdula said. ''Calories do count,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While high-fat foods typically have many calories, so do many low-fat foods, including ones like nonfat cookies or muffins that dieters buy in place of the real thing, obesity experts point out.</p>
        <p>Because the total number of calories, a measure of the energy value of food, is what determines whether a person loses weight, stays the same, or gains weight, people ignore calories at their peril, obesity experts say.</p>
        <p>It is one thing for someone to want to be at the bottom of their weight range, obesity experts said. It may be quite another for them to know how to do it.</p>
        <p>''The people who watch and know the calorie content of foods are labeled as overzealous and obsessed with foods,'' Dr. Fernstrom said. But, she said: ''You do need to learn the calories that are in certain portions of food. You do have to have some control over the types and amounts of foods that are going into your mouth.''</p>
        <p>It is all too easy for people to eat more than they realize, obesity experts said. In a recent study, Dr. George Bray, an obesity expert at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, asked dietitians to estimate the number of calories they were consuming, thinking that if anyone should get it right, it was these professionals.</p>
        <p>''They underreported by 10 percent,'' Dr. Bray said.</p>
        <p>Many Americans also delude themselves about how much benefit they are getting from exercise, researchers say. In Dr. Serdula's national survey, about two-thirds of the people who were trying to lose weight said they were increasing their physical activity. But only 21 percent reported exercising at least 150 minutes a week, which is the minimum recommended for weight loss.</p>
        <p>The goal now, Dr. Hill said, should be to teach people what is really required to control their weights. It means showing people what the participants in his registry of successful dieters do.</p>
        <p>''These people have figured out that they can't just leave it to chance,'' Dr. Hill said. ''They have to plan their diet and they have to plan their exercise.''</p>
        <p>A Choice for a Lifetime</p>
        <p>Growing up, Eileen Barton had seemed like one of those girls who would never have to worry about her weight. She gave no conscious thought to what she was eating yet remained slender and healthy. In fact, she says, the first time she even thought about her weight seems silly in retrospect.</p>
        <p>She was a junior in high school, 5 foot 6 and weighing 115 pounds. Anyone would say she was thin, but she decided she had a weight problem because she thought her hips bulged too much when she wore a bikini. ''I thought I had this disgusting problem,'' she said. The next year, however, she weighed even more -- 120 pounds. ''I remember thinking, 'This is all wrong. I was supposed to go down. I wasn't supposed to go up,' '' Ms. Barton said. ''I was flipping out.''</p>
        <p>Then came college, and the beginning of a real weight problem. At Wheaton College, an all-woman institution in Massachusetts, the students would joke about ''the freshman 20,'' the 20 pounds that freshmen often gained. Ms. Barton far exceeded it. In her first two years, she gained 60 pounds, topping the scales at 180. Her weight gain was no mystery. ''I was bingeing,'' she said. Miserable about they way she looked, she tried desperately to lose weight.</p>
        <p>''I remember the feelings and the thoughts were, 'How did I ever allow it to get out of my control? This wasn't supposed to happen to me,' '' Ms. Barton said. She tried fad diets, like a high-protein diet and the Scarsdale diet. Once she fasted for two weeks. But the pounds she lost came right back.</p>
        <p>Alarmed, her mother took her to a doctor  because she was convinced that Ms. Barton must have a thyroid problem. She turned out to be perfectly healthy. Just fat.</p>
        <p>After college, Ms. Barton moved to Denver. There, over two years, she assiduously dieted and exercised and the weight slowly came off. With her weight down to 135 pounds, a perfect size 8, Ms. Barton decided that that awful period of her life as a fat woman was behind her. Now that she was thin she would never have to think about dieting again.</p>
        <p>It was not to be. The only way to maintain her weight, Ms. Barton learned, was to watch what she ate and to exercise regularly, walking or riding her bike for an hour to an hour and a half each day. Even so, staying at 135 pounds was beyond her. At that weight, she found herself obsessed with food and unable to control her eating. She let her weight creep up to 140 to 145, and she now carefully keeps track of it so it goes no higher. She also gave away her size 8 clothes.</p>
        <p>''I'm at the point where I say, 'O.K. I've got more on my hips than probably exceeds my best desire, but I feel great,' '' Ms. Barton said.</p>
        <p>When she gets depressed about her weight, she goes to a Web site that gives body mass indices, a measurement of obesity, and verifies that she is not even close to being too fat.</p>
        <p>But still, Ms. Barton said, she often wishes she could just forget, for once, about what she is eating.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to just live my life and not think about it,'' she said.</p>

Serdula, who led the survey, said many tried to control their weight by controlling their fat intake, a strategy that Dr. Serdula and other experts said was ineffective. Or they fail to exercise. But Dr. Serdula said she was not at all surprised that so many Americans wee trying so hard to keep their weight under control.</p>
        <p>''Weight is a big concern in America,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Until recently, obesity experts would have wrung their hands in dismay over such statistics. Chronic dieters, they would have said, either have eating disorders or are on their way to developing them.</p>
        <p>Now, however, increasing numbers of experts say that view is woefully wrong. In today's society, where ever greater varieties of food, in larger and larger portions, always beckon, these experts have concluded that the only way for most people to control their weight is to be like Ms. Barton, exquisitely aware of food, planning their eating and planning exercise to burn off calories and never letting a day go by when what to eat and how much to eat and how much to exercise is not on their minds.</p>
        <p>''How many people eat because they're hungry?'' asks Dr. James Hill, an obesity researcher at the University of Colorado  Health Science Center in Denver. ''We eat because it's 12 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>While there are what Dr. Hill calls ''the genetic superstars'' who are naturally thin and who naturally stop eating when their body tells them they have had enough, ''the data suggests that they are in the minority,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''The only way to keep from gaining weight is to make gaining weight a conscious activity rather than an unconscious activity,'' Dr. Hill said. ''If you leave it to your physiology, you're going to gain weight. You have to plan.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Madelyn H. Fernstrom, director of the weight management center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System, put it bluntly: ''The term 'chronic dieter' is not a negative one.''</p>
        <p>And, Dr. Hill added, it is the responsibility of obesity researchers to tell the public that they really do have to think about food and exercise all the time.</p>
        <p>Ever Vigilant on Regimens</p>
        <p>For years, the great hope and promise of diet programs had been to get people's weight down and then allow them to, in essence, forget about food, living the rest of their lives like someone who was naturally thin.</p>
        <p>''That was the meta-message. You go on a diet for short period of time and then the diet's over,'' said Dr. Gary D. Foster, who is the clinical director of the Weight and Eating Disorders Program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>If only it were so simple, chronic dieters say.</p>
        <p>Mary Litman began dieting years ago, when she was 20. She remembers the moment she resolved to lose weight, at the end of a date with a good-looking young man.</p>
        <p>He walked her to her door, she recalled, and said, ''It's a good thing you have a pretty face because you're really fat.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Litman was 5 foot 2 and weighed 125 pounds. Her date was right, she decided. All that oblivious eating of cakes and pies that her mother, a farmer's wife, had made for the family had taken their toll.</p>
        <p>''I was farm-girl fat -- pretty, but chubby,'' Ms. Litman said.</p>
        <p>She began a life of dieting, first losing about 10 pounds, then learning to maintain it. She walks at least four miles a day, makes deliberate food choices and bargains with herself in a constant internal conversation.</p>
        <p>The other day, for example, one of the women in her office at the University of Pittsburgh Health System, where she is an administrative coordinator, brought in homemade cannoli.</p>
        <p>''I said to myself, 'I'm going to eat it,' '' Ms. Litman declared. But then, she told herself, ''If you do, you have to walk home from work and eat a salad for dinner.'' Which is exactly what she did.</p>
        <p>She plans ways to keep her portions small. ''If I buy a pound of grapes and leave them in a big package, I'll eat every one of them,'' she said. ''If I put them in baggies, I'll eat what's in a baggie.'' When she wants mint candy, she buys Junior Mints rather than a large mint patty and eats a few at a time. ''If you buy a mint patty, it's gone,'' Ms. Litman said.</p>
        <p>Others have more extreme regimens.</p>
        <p>''I've been in pretty good shape now for decades,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman, who directs the clinical research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''But it's only because of being concerned every day with what I eat and what I burn up.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Wurtman, who describes himself as a fat person in a thin person's body, says he is so concerned about getting his aerobic exercise every day that he calls hotels before he visits them when he travels to make sure they have stair-stepping machines.</p>
        <p>''There's one hotel in Paris that I've gone to for 15 years because they had the only StairMaster in town,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also keeps a mental tally of the calories he consumes each day, aiming for a total of about 2,000. Breakfast is always grapefruit juice, black coffee and a bran muffin made by his wife, Dr. Judith Wurtman, who directs Triad, a commercial weight-loss center in Belmont, Mass. No bakery muffins for the Wurtmans. They can have 600 calories, Dr. Wurtman said.</p>
        <p>Lunch for Dr. Wurtman is either a cup of soup or nothing at all, unless he has a visitor and goes out to eat. ''Then I compensate later,'' he said, eating less for the rest of the day. After work, Dr. Wurtman has ''a dab of cottage cheese -- we buy the fat-free kind -- and I pour some soy sauce on it to make it taste good.'' Then he goes to the gym. After working out, he and his wife have dinner. ''It's very spartan -- fish and lots of vegetables and good bread.'' For dessert, he gets a treat -- some frozen yogurt.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be fat,'' Dr. Wurtman said. ''I don't want my clothes to be tight on me. I like the sense of looking in a mirror and not being displeased.''</p>
        <p>Control, a Relative Term</p>
        <p>In a sense, Ms. Barton, Ms. Litman and Dr. Wurtman are lucky. With chronic dieting, they have learned to stay thin. Not everyone is able to do so, obesity researchers say. Some are simply misinformed about how to do it. Others are biologically unable to become thin -- the most they can realistically hope for is to be less fat.</p>
        <p>In recent years, an ever-accumulating body of evidence has led most obesity researchers to a troubling conclusion: except within certain narrow limits, people may  not be able to control their weight completely. Each individual, they say, inherits genes that predetermine a range of body weights -- varying about 10 percent from a midpoint, that they can maintain. The chronic dieters, through their constant vigilance, are keeping their weights as low as their genes will allow. The notion of natural weight ranges can be hard for many people to accept, obesity experts say. The idea that anyone who wants to could be thin, is ''the biggest misunderstanding in medicine,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hirsch and others point out that years of research consistently show that if someone's weight gets out of her genetically determined range -- either because she has managed to eat so much that she becomes fatter or because she diets so much that she becomes thinner -- her body is driven to lose or gain weight to force her weight back in line. Those who are above their range lose their appetites and lose interest in food. At the same time, their body's metabolism actually speeds up to push their weight back down. Those who are below their range become obsessed with food and unable to control their urges to eat. In that situation, the body's metabolism slows down to make the pounds creep back on, researchers find.</p>
        <p>That, of course, does not mean that environment plays no role in making people grow fat. After all, researchers add, genes cannot change overnight, but environments can. And something must be making people gain weight. Many experts say that more and more Americans are responding to a society that insidiously encourages them to be as fat as their genes will allow them to be. Instead of being at the bottom of their weight range, like the chronic dieters, many people are at the top.</p>
        <p>But what is it that tempts people to eat so much? Hypotheses abound.</p>
        <p>''Portion sizes are enormous,'' said Dr. F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, a professor of medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. ''People are walking around with liter cups of milkshakes. And people nibble all the time. They're eating on the street, they're eating all night while they watch television.''</p>
        <p>Americans are eating more and more meals away from home, too. Fast foods are notoriously fattening. But expensive restaurants, too, have been known to ladle on the fat, knowing it makes their food taste good.</p>
        <p>Mashed potatoes at luxury restaurants may contain one part butter to two parts potatoes and even vegetables often get a tablespoon of butter per serving added on their way out of the kitchen. At Union Pacific, a Manhattan restaurant, the menu correctly said that its halibut was poached, but it did not say in what. The answer, said the proprietor and chef, Rocco DiSpirito, was goose fat.</p>
        <p>''Fat is an important element of flavor,'' Mr. DiSpirito explained.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jeffrey M. Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University, likes to explain weight ranges by analogy with height. With height, he said, people -- and animals -- are pretty much at the mercy of their inheritance, but the environment can -- and does -- make a big difference. After all, he said, the average height of soldiers during the Civil War was 5 foot 4. But while diet can make people grow taller, the upper and lower limits of an individual's height is  set by genes. The same may be true with weight, Dr. Friedman said.</p>
        <p>''There's an illusion that you can control weight,'' he said, ''but the facts don't support that.''</p>
        <p>Expectations vs. Reality</p>
        <p>Researchers who have seen what they describe as overwhelming evidence of biologically determined weight ranges say they are becoming weary of hearing promoters of weight-loss programs insist that people could be really thin if they truly wanted to.</p>
        <p>''They insist that if you would just eat less,'' Dr. Hirsch said. ''How many calories would it take? Come on, a mouthful less a day. Can't you do that,'' he said, adding,  ''Everyone wants to focus on the behavior side, as though people are perversely eating one bite more.''</p>
        <p>But behavior has failed to explain why people stay fat, Dr. Hirsch and others say. Studies searching for behavioral characteristics, like binge eating, eating too quickly or skipping meals that typified obesity failed to find consistent patterns. Every behavior by fat people was found just as often in thin people.</p>
        <p>It is a lesson that has been met with denial or disbelief, even by some who run research programs on obesity. These experts say that until recently they would point to height-weight charts and tell fat people that their goal should be to get to what the chart said was an optimal weight for their height. Only a few got their weights down that low and even fewer could maintain them. Now, these researchers say, they are citing what is a more realistic weight goal -- a loss of about 10 percent of body weight, which often is enough to make people healthier, lowering their blood sugar and blood pressure.</p>
        <p>But such modest goals are not always  easy for fat people to accept, Dr. Foster said. Achieving them requires great effort -- and constant vigilance for life -- but it also means coming to terms with the fact that, for many, being slender will always be a fantasy.</p>
        <p>In a recent study, Dr. Foster and his colleagues asked 60 obese women to reveal what they hoped for, and what they dreamed of, when they began a diet and exercise program. The women, whose average weight was 218 pounds, said their goal was to lose, on average, about a third of their body weight, or 71 pounds for a new weight of 146 pounds. They said that their dream would be to get down to 135 pounds.</p>
        <p>But after 48 weeks of diet and exercise, their average weight loss was just 37 pounds, a loss that they had described before the study as ''disappointing and could not be viewed as successful in any way.'' And that was before they tried to maintain what they had lost.</p>
        <p>Obesity experts say that many fat people will have to lower their expectations and realize that they can look and feel better even though they will not be thin.</p>
        <p>''Most of us have a little bit of an unrealistic idea of what we should look like,'' said Cathy Monas, the director of the weight management and nutrition center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Monas reminds patients of how much better their lives are with even a small but sustainable weight loss. ''We say, 'Look, you're maintaining your weight. Your blood pressure has gone down, your cholesterol has gone down, you're playing tennis again. This is terrific.' ''</p>
        <p>That, of course, is not the message that many fat people want to hear.</p>
        <p>Dr. Foster says he tries to explain to patients that they must be realistic. But, he said, ''when you tell a woman who weighs 220 pounds that she has to lose 22 pounds, she looks at you like you've got three heads.''</p>
        <p>Planning Diet and Exercise</p>
        <p>Dr. Fernstrom says she is still dumbfounded when she sees what many do to try to lose weight. Over and over again, she says, her patients will tell her they drank fruit juice with abandon or ate bags of fat-free pretzels, reasoning that because these foods had no fat, they are not fattening.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I call it the great hope of American eating, that nonfat means non caloric,'' Dr. Fernstrom said. ''This has been a sabotage.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Serdula of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the same thing in the national survey she directed. About 35 percent of the men and 40 percent of the women who were trying to lose weight said they were controlling their food intake by eating less fat. That simply does not work, Dr. Serdula said. ''Calories do count,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While high-fat foods typically have many calories, so do many low-fat foods, including ones like nonfat cookies or muffins that dieters buy in place of the real thing, obesity experts point out.</p>
        <p>Because the total number of calories, a measure of the energy value of food, is what determines whether a person loses weight, stays the same, or gains weight, people ignore calories at their peril, obesity experts say.</p>
        <p>It is one thing for someone to want to be at the bottom of their weight range, obesity experts said. It may be quite another for them to know how to do it.</p>
        <p>''The people who watch and know the calorie content of foods are labeled as overzealous and obsessed with foods,'' Dr. Fernstrom said. But, she said: ''You do need to learn the calories that are in certain portions of food. You do have to have some control over the types and amounts of foods that are going into your mouth.''</p>
        <p>It is all too easy for people to eat more than they realize, obesity experts said. In a recent study, Dr. George Bray, an obesity expert at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, asked dietitians to estimate the number of calories they were consuming, thinking that if anyone should get it right, it was these professionals.</p>
        <p>''They underreported by 10 percent,'' Dr. Bray said.</p>
        <p>Many Americans also delude themselves about how much benefit they are getting from exercise, researchers say. In Dr. Serdula's national survey, about two-thirds of the people who were trying to lose weight said they were increasing their physical activity. But only 21 percent reported exercising at least 150 minutes a week, which is the minimum recommended for weight loss.</p>
        <p>The goal now, Dr. Hill said, should be to teach people what is really required to control their weights. It means showing people what the participants in his registry of successful dieters do.</p>
        <p>''These people have figured out that they can't just leave it to chance,'' Dr. Hill said. ''They have to plan their diet and they have to plan their exercise.''</p>
        <p>A Choice for a Lifetime</p>
        <p>Growing up, Eileen Barton had seemed like one of those girls who would never have to worry about her weight. She gave no conscious thought to what she was eating yet remained slender and healthy. In fact, she says, the first time she even thought about her weight seems silly in retrospect.</p>
        <p>She was a junior in high school, 5 foot 6 and weighing 115 pounds. Anyone would say she was thin, but she decided she had a weight problem because she thought her hips bulged too much when she wore a bikini. ''I thought I had this disgusting problem,'' she said. The next year, however, she weighed even more -- 120 pounds. ''I remember thinking, 'This is all wrong. I was supposed to go down. I wasn't supposed to go up,' '' Ms. Barton said. ''I was flipping out.''</p>
        <p>Then came college, and the beginning of a real weight problem. At Wheaton College, an all-woman institution in Massachusetts, the students would joke about ''the freshman 20,'' the 20 pounds that freshmen often gained. Ms. Barton far exceeded it. In her first two years, she gained 60 pounds, topping the scales at 180. Her weight gain was no mystery. ''I was bingeing,'' she said. Miserable about they way she looked, she tried desperately to lose weight.</p>
        <p>''I remember the feelings and the thoughts were, 'How did I ever allow it to get out of my control? This wasn't supposed to happen to me,' '' Ms. Barton said. She tried fad diets, like a high-protein diet and the Scarsdale diet. Once she fasted for two weeks. But the pounds she lost came right back.</p>
        <p>Alarmed, her mother took her to a doctor  because she was convinced that Ms. Barton must have a thyroid problem. She turned out to be perfectly healthy. Just fat.</p>
        <p>After college, Ms. Barton moved to Denver. There, over two years, she assiduously dieted and exercised and the weight slowly came off. With her weight down to 135 pounds, a perfect size 8, Ms. Barton decided that that awful period of her life as a fat woman was behind her. Now that she was thin she would never have to think about dieting again.</p>
        <p>It was not to be. The only way to maintain her weight, Ms. Barton learned, was to watch what she ate and to exercise regularly, walking or riding her bike for an hour to an hour and a half each day. Even so, staying at 135 pounds was beyond her. At that weight, she found herself obsessed with food and unable to control her eating. She let her weight creep up to 140 to 145, and she now carefully keeps track of it so it goes no higher. She also gave away her size 8 clothes.</p>
        <p>''I'm at the point where I say, 'O.K. I've got more on my hips than probably exceeds my best desire, but I feel great,' '' Ms. Barton said.</p>
        <p>When she gets depressed about her weight, she goes to a Web site that gives body mass indices, a measurement of obesity, and verifies that she is not even close to being too fat.</p>
        <p>But still, Ms. Barton said, she often wishes she could just forget, for once, about what she is eating.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to just live my life and not think about it,'' she said.</p>
