        <p>AMERICANS drink their Scotch, bourbon and Canadian whiskey any number of ways -- on the rocks and neat, in highballs and in cocktails. But we drink most of our Irish whiskey, if we drink it at all, mixed with hot, sweetened, creamy coffee.</p>
        <p>Not so the Irish, and not so me, at least not all the time. I'm the last person to turn up my nose at proper Irish coffee (which by my lights means a dark, strong brew infused with good whiskey and just a little sugar, with real cream floated on top, not that nasty synthetic stuff squirted from an aerosol container). I drink it often when the mood is upon me, usually after dinner when the weather outside is frightful and the fire is so delightful.</p>

        <p>AMERICANS drink their Scotch, bourbon and Canadian whiskey any number of ways -- on the rocks and neat, in highballs and in cocktails. But we drink most of our Irish whiskey, if we drink it at all, mixed with hot, sweetened, creamy coffee.</p>
        <p>Not so the Irish, and not so me, at least not all the time. I'm the last person to turn up my nose at proper Irish coffee (which by my lights means a dark, strong brew infused with good whiskey and just a little sugar, with real cream floated on top, not that nasty synthetic stuff squirted from an aerosol container). I drink it often when the mood is upon me, usually after dinner when the weather outside is frightful and the fire is so delightful.</p>
        <p>But put me in an age-encrusted Irish pub some evening, among those unfailingly sociable and hospitable people, with the smell of peat hanging in the air, and I'll ask for a couple of fingers of Jameson. If I see Redbreast or Bushmills Malt behind the bar, I'll go for that in a nanosecond. Nothing, except maybe a pint of Guinness or Beamish, fits the time and place so well.</p>
        <p>The mellow, easygoing charm of Irish whiskey perfectly matches the mood of the pubs. If you want something to snap your head back, look elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Americans seem to be moving beyond Irish coffee. Although Irish whiskey still accounts for only two-tenths of 1 percent of spirits sales in the United States, and seven-tenths of 1 percent of whiskey sales, consumption is increasing. In 1999, 325,000 cases of Irish were sold in the United States, up from 265,000 in 1995, according to the 2000 edition of Impact's authoritative spirits study. (Scotch whiskey sales in 1999 amounted to more than 8.2 million cases.)</p>
        <p>But how did we Americans develop our dump-the-Irish-in-the-coffee habit in the first place? The tale has to do with Foynes, a quiet little town west of Limerick, and a group of cold, miserable, no doubt disgruntled passengers who filed off a flying boat here late one night in 1942 onto a jetty that stuck out into the sheltered estuary of the River Shannon.</p>
        <p>More of that in a moment or two. But let us begin at the beginning, with a visit to the Jameson Irish Whiskey Heritage Center, a group of dour gray limestone buildings at Midleton, east of Cork.</p>
        <p>At the heritage center you can not only taste a lot of whiskey, all in the name of dispassionate scientific analysis -- not a bad way to spend a foggy morning -- but also tour the 19th-century distillery, now a museum that retains the aroma of whiskey making. They built 'em big in those days. An iron waterwheel installed in 1852 measures 22 feet in diameter, and the biggest pot still, its copper still gleaming after decades of use, held 31,648 gallons and consumed four tons of coal a day.</p>
        <p>Midleton is also the site of the only large working distillery in the Irish Republic.  There's a much smaller upstart called Cooley's at Kilbeggan, County Clare, which makes three single malts -- Tyrconnell, Connemara and Knappogue Castle, the last a rich, creamy, vanilla-scented dream -- and a second big distillery at Bushmills, County Antrim, in Northern Ireland -- the world's oldest licensed distillery, in fact, chartered by James I in 1608.</p>
        <p>A bit of background may be in order here. The brands most familiar in the United States, like Jameson and Bushmills, are produced by the same company, Irish Distillers, which since 1988 has itself been part of Pernod Ricard, the big French spirits group. Irish Distillers also makes Midleton Very Rare, Paddy and Powers, which is much the largest seller in Ireland but not as well known outside this country.</p>
        <p>The brands differ sharply in formula and hence in flavor, and they command fervent followings, sometimes for reasons of taste, sometimes for political reasons (I know some fiercely patriotic Irishmen who won't drink Bushmills because of its connections with Ulster, and hence with Britain), sometimes for reasons of regional loyalty (former Prime Minister Jack Lynch, a Cork man, always ordered Paddy, originally a Cork whiskey, and expected those drinking with him to do likewise).</p>
        <p>Several things set Irish whiskey apart from its cousins. Scotch gets a smoky flavor from the peat and turf fires used to dry the grain that goes into it; the malted barley that goes into Irish is dried in closed kilns over smokeless anthracite fires, so the whiskey has a clear, milder taste. Bourbon gets its distinctive sweetness from the corn used in its distillation.</p>
        <p>Bourbon is distilled once, Scotch twice and Irish three times, lending a greater smoothness to Irish whiskey, or so its producers contend. But then they also rhapsodize at Midleton over the special, magical qualities of the water they draw from the River Dungourney -- singing the same songs in praise of the ''unique'' taste of their limestone-filtered local H2 O that you hear when you ask questions in Louisville or Glasgow. Only the accent is different.</p>
        <p>Distilled in pot stills or columnar stills, which produce a somewhat less refined spirit, the whiskey is then blended. Jameson's standard bottling, for example, is half pot still, half columnar. After blending, the whiskey goes into used oak barrels for aging, more than 12 years in the case of some of the premium blends. Old sherry, port and bourbon barrels each impart a slightly different flavor as the spirits react with and gain flavor from the wood.</p>
        <p>Single-malt Scotch -- that is, the unblended product of a single distillation -- and single-barrel and small-batch bourbon have achieved much greater currency than single-malt Irish. Irish Distillers produces only one, at Bushmills. It is available in both 12- and 16-year-old versions.</p>
        <p>Of the dozen or so whiskeys I tasted at Midleton and elsewhere during my 10 days in Ireland, I was most taken with Redbreast, a 12-year-old, pure pot-still product of Irish Distillers. Almost impossible to find outside Ireland and scarce even here, it is well worth asking for, with a slightly sweet, bourbon-like nose; a strong but not a ''hot,''  stinging taste and a wonderfully long, lingering finish, reminiscent of a superior Cognac or Armagnac.</p>
        <p>A Bushmills Malt 16-year-old, matured in three woods, had a nutty nose and a thoroughly pleasant malty taste, all of a piece from start to finish.</p>
        <p>I also liked a Powers Millennium 12-year-old, a special bottling. It had a chocolate/ caramel nose and filled the mouth at once, but lacked the remarkable staying power of Redbreast.</p>
        <p>David Byrne, the assistant manager of the Old Midleton Distillery, gave me some of his company's thoughts on the consumption of Irish whiskey. Jameson, the worldwide best seller, is best drunk neat, he said, perhaps in a snifter to allow its spicy, sherry-tinged nose to develop; the same applies to Jameson 1780, a deluxe 12-year-old whiskey matured mostly in old sherry casks.</p>
        <p>Powers is the local favorite for making Irish coffee because of its hefty, honeyed flavor. Bushmills, smooth and unusually oaky in flavor, may be the best all-round standard brand, good on the rocks. Midleton Very Rare, made from casks individually selected by the master distiller, like a single-barrel bourbon, has a floral, herbal bouquet, a taste marked by notes of fruits and almonds and a velvety finish.</p>
        <p>But to return to those folks we left at Foynes back in 1942 . . .</p>
        <p>They had taken off for Botwood, Newfoundland, 10 hours earlier, but they had been forced back by foul weather -- no uncommon occurrence in those relatively early days of long-distance commercial aviation. Regular trans-Atlantic passenger service had in fact been inaugurated only three years before, mainly because of the threat posed to merchant vessels by Nazi U-boats.</p>
        <p>Between 1939 and 1945, generals, admirals, ministers, prominent refugees and film stars passed through Foynes, the staging point for air traffic between Britain and the United States, allies in the common struggle against Germany. Adm. Chester W. Nimitz was among them, and Bob Hope and Clare Boothe Luce. Some of the passengers were in uniform; others traveled under false passports.</p>
        <p>The local people were well disposed to the pioneering passengers in their midst, even though Ireland was officially neutral. The Knight of Glin, one of Ireland's great hereditary landowners, who lived just down the road, regularly sent fruit and vegetables from his walled garden to the flying boats.</p>
        <p>Although it is not known exactly who was on board on the night in question, they were history makers. No doubt about that. Because when they reached the little Foynes terminal, looking glum and dog-tired, they encountered Joe Sheridan, a chef in the restaurant there, who was evidently a kindly as well as an inventive man.</p>
        <p>Deciding that they needed a stiffener, he combined strong black coffee, some sugar and a tot of good Irish whiskey, then floated a cap of thick, ivory-hued local cream on top.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Buddy,'' an American passenger is supposed to have asked the chef, ''is this Brazilian coffee?''</p>
        <p>''No,'' he is alleged to have responded, ''that's Irish coffee.''</p>
        <p>The conversation may be apocryphal, but Mr. Sheridan's concoction was real enough, and he kept making it when he crossed the river to the new Shannon Airport, which opened in 1945 to serve land-based trans-Atlantic flights. In the early 1950's, Stanton Delaplane, then a columnist for The San Francisco Chronicle, tasted it and persuaded Mr. Sheridan to give him the recipe.</p>
        <p>He passed it in turn to his friend Jack Koepler, an owner of the Buena Vista Cafe, his favorite watering hole back home, which is still going strong, down by the waterfront where the Hyde Street cable car turns around.</p>
        <p>It caused a sensation. There was, and is, something unmistakably sensual about sipping the hot, whiskey-laced coffee through the cool, sweet cream. Soon bars everywhere, and not a few private houses, laid in a stock of Irish whiskey and a handful of small stemmed glasses, often decorated with a shamrock, with a flange in the stem that could be grasped firmly without searing one's fingers. At one time, or so the story goes, more Irish whiskey was consumed in San Francisco than in Ireland.</p>
        <p>Eventually Joe Sheridan moved to San Francisco to work at the Buena Vista, then drifted away. He died in 1962 in the Marshall Islands, a very long way from Foynes.</p>
        <p>Finding the Unusual</p>
        <p>The standard brands of Irish whiskey -- Jameson, Bushmills and Midleton -- can be found in good liquor stores. More unusual bottles can often be found in Manhattan at Park Avenue Liquors, 292 Madison Avenue at 40th Street, and Crossroads Wine and Liquor, 55 West 14th Street.</p>
