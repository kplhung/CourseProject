        <p>When the Yankees nailed down their 37th American League pennant last night, they set up the 14th Subway Series, the first one against the Mets and the first in 44 years. After losing the first two such intracity showdowns to the New York Giants in 1921-22, when both teams shared the Polo Grounds as their home field, the Yankees won the next nine Subway Series, until the Brooklyn Dodgers broke the spell in 1955. The team from the Bronx is 10-3 in Subway Series: 4-2 against teams from Manhattan; 6-1 against teams from Brooklyn, and 0-0 against the team from Queens.</p>
