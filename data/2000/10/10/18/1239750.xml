        <p>Unable to get enough microchips to make everything it could have sold, the International Business Machines Corporation reported yesterday that it had squeezed out the profits Wall Street had expected for the third quarter but had fallen short of revenue projections.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. said it earned $2 billion, or $1.08 a share, in its third quarter, up 16 percent from 93 cents a share, or $1.8 billion, a year earlier. Adjusting for a 3-cent-a-share gain last year on the sale of the I.B.M. Global Network and other one-time events, earnings per share increased 20 percent. Analysts reporting to First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of $1.08 a share.</p>
        <p>But third-quarter 2000 revenues grew 3 percent, to $21.78 billion from $21.14 billion a year ago. I.B.M. said the increase would have been 6 percent without currency fluctuations.</p>
        <p>Highlights for the quarter included the long-awaited return to profitability of I.B.M.'s personal computer business, strong demand in Asia and strong growth from a number of businesses tied to I.B.M.'s strategy of focusing on electronic commerce and the Internet.</p>
        <p>But sales of large computers were below estimates because of parts shortages for popular models and, in other cases, customers deferring purchases of mainframes in anticipation of the availability in December of I.B.M.'s powerful new z900 unit. Software sales were hit by slower hardware sales and by heavy turnover in the sales force. And key portions of the disk drive business remained too soft to halt a long-running trend of declining sales.</p>
        <p>The report was released after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where I.B.M. shares were up $1.88, to $113. The shares fell below $100 in after-hours trading within minutes of the release of the earnings numbers.</p>
        <p>''The key question is whether the demand is there for their technology, and I.B.M. has just blown it from a supply standpoint,'' said Thomas Kraemer at Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. could have had an additional 2 percent in revenues -- nearly $436 million -- had it been able to build all of the electronic components it needed to meet demand from its own hardware groups and its fast-growing business supplying other equipment manufacturers, according to John R. Joyce, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joyce said that I.B.M. expected revenues to grow faster in the current quarter but that the company would continue to face supply constraints into next year, even though it is expanding its manufacturing capacity and working with outside vendors to fill some of its needs. As an example of how the component shortages hurt in the recent quarter, Mr. Joyce said sales of the company's large Unix servers would have grown at more than 30 percent instead of the 15 percent it achieved had it been able to build more of them.</p>
        <p>I.B.M.'s currency problems centered in Europe and could get worse in the current quarter, given the continued strength of the dollar, Mr. Joyce said. The decline in European currencies turned what would have been an 8 percent increase in revenue from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, had exchange rates been stable, into a 3 percent decline, to $5.6 billion.</p>
        <p>Like other personal computer vendors, I.B.M. is having trouble in the desktop market. Although the company sharply reduced its activity in that area by ending retail sales last year and through stringent cost-cutting, it still lost money on desktops. But strong sales of Thinkpad laptops and Netfinity servers were enough to push the personal systems unit into the black with a 17 percent growth in revenue, an event Mr. Joyce hailed as a ''significant milestone.''</p>
        <p>Over all, hardware revenues were $9.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 4 percent, compared with last year's third quarter. Revenue from I.B.M. Global Services, including maintenance, which also grew 4 percent in the third quarter, reached $8.2 billion.</p>
        <p>The Global Services unit experienced especially strong growth in demand for outsourcing services in the Asia-Pacific region. I.B.M. said it had signed $13.3 billion in services contracts in the quarter, its second-strongest ever.</p>
        <p>Software revenue declined 3 percent in the quarter, to $2.9 billion. Mr. Joyce said that the company failed to close as many contracts as it usually does at the end of a quarter. At least part of the problem might be attributable to high turnover rates in the sales force. In addition, sales plummeted for some older products as the sales force focused on rapidly growing new ones like WebSphere.</p>
        <p>Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive, called the quarter solid, but John B. Jones, who follows the company for Salomon Smith Barney, summed up the results as understandable rather than satisfying. ''They have a 16-cylinder engine that rarely runs with all 16 firing in unison,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
