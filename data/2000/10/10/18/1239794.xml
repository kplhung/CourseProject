        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush dropped the pleasantries of their previous debate last night and held their most spirited confrontation to date while outlining their disagreements over tax cuts, health care, schools, campaign finance and other subjects. Taking questions this time before a ''town meeting'' audience, both the candidates put in vigorous performances, but it was Mr. Gore who dominated their exchanges. He offered a tighter, more cogent presentation of his policies and for the first time in weeks recaptured some of the passion of his Democratic convention speech. The Texas governor responded by promising to bring a new tone of bipartisan cooperation to Washington, but he seemed less at ease than in last week's debate in engaging the budgetary and legislative details laid out by Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Though most opinion polls show a close race, Mr. Bush has been running ahead of Mr. Gore in recent days. The difference has been magnified by their recent demeanor, with Mr. Bush looking more confident on the campaign trail and Mr. Gore seeming tentative and off his game. Last night, however, Mr. Gore dropped the almost phlegmatic manner he adopted last week, paced the large stage area and repeatedly challenged the governor directly with his answers. ''All right, here we go again,'' he said before dissecting Mr. Bush's first answer on drug prices, and that set the style for an evening marked by Mr. Bush's complaints that Mr. Gore was not following the debate ground rules.</p>
        <p>On education, Mr. Gore dismissed the governor's proposals for testing with a wave of the hand and added that Mr. Bush's voucher plan would drain the public schools. On health care, he pointed at Mr. Bush and declared that if the voters wanted a program embraced by the drug companies, ''this is your man.'' Mr. Bush answered those thrusts with thematic responses depicting Mr. Gore as an exponent of big government. ''If this were a spending contest,'' he said, ''I'd come in second.''</p>
        <p>Over all, however, Mr. Gore was the aggressor and pace-setter. After last week's much-criticized performance he seemed willing, almost eager, to risk the possibility of some people's finding him unlikable. By being less reluctant to unleash a torrent of facts he seemed to throw Mr. Bush off balance, though the governor closed with a well-formed argument for sending a change agent to Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's principal theme once again was that the vice president wanted to exploit issues for political gain rather than solve problems. He played down the policy differences between their two health plans, saying simply that the real ''difference is that I can get it done.'' But for the first time in their debates, Mr. Gore dwelled on the economic accomplishments of the last eight years and invited voters to ponder the risks of changing leadership.</p>
        <p>The contrast between the two candidates on tax policy was especially sharp in an exchange over the estate tax. Mr. Gore said he favored removing the tax for most farm families and small businesses, but not the most wealthy. Mr. Bush was forced to argue for fairness for the very rich, and accused Mr. Gore of leaving 50 million Americans with no tax relief. Even on the issues of violence, pornography in popular culture and the death penalty -- traditional issues for Republicans -- Mr. Gore was more muscular in his response than Mr. Bush, who looked awkward when he gave a defensive answer about whether he was excessively keen on imposing the death penalty.</p>
        <p>It may take several days before voters evolve a firm sense of who won the debate, but Mr. Gore's forces were sure to be energized by his return to form. He laid the groundwork for a final campaign push on the issue of Social Security by getting Mr. Bush to acknowledge that the $1 trillion program for private investment accounts for young working people would be taken from the Social Security surplus in coming years. The vice president is sure to keep the issue alive by charging that this money will not then be available for future retirees.</p>
        <p>But the biggest contrast could be seen in the way each candidate addressed the issue of trust. For Mr. Bush, trust was a question of who could end the bickering in Washington. Mr. Gore's more potent formulation was that Americans could trust him to ''fight for you'' against special interests. The next three weeks will determine which choice is preferred by voters.</p>
