        <p>At least four people were killed and 33 injured today when a high-speed train traveling north from London derailed, raising new concerns about the safety of Britain's privatized railroads.</p>
        <p>The accident, which sent a number of cars skittering off the track and onto their sides, occurred just two weeks after the anniversary of a 1999 crash near Paddington Station that left 31 dead. Since that crash, a commission led by Lord Cullen has been studying railroad safety and is to publish a series of recommendations soon.</p>
        <p>Recently, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott pledged to devote $87  billion during the next 10 years to improving the structural condition of Britain's railways.</p>
        <p>Investigators from the British Transport Police said they did not know what had caused today's crash at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, about 30 miles outside of London. But they confirmed that another rail line had received a bomb threat on Sunday, making terrorism one possibility, albeit a remote one.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Great North Eastern Railway company said the train, the 12:10 from London to Leeds, was traveling about 115 miles per hour around a bend when several middle cars careered off the track and down a bank. Two front cars were left on the track, with the seven behind derailing.</p>
        <p>The dead were most likely in or near the buffet restaurant car, which toppled over and was almost demolished, with its roof sliced off, witnesses said. It was unclear how many people were on the train, but about 100 passengers walked off or were freed by rescue workers. Some had minor injuries and were classified as ''walking wounded.''</p>
        <p>Survivors described the scene as ''mayhem'' and said they had had no warning before the crash.</p>
        <p>Britain's train services, which are operated by a number of different companies, have been plagued by derailments and crashes through the years. Two years ago, nine people were hurt when a train derailed on the same track as today's train, 25 miles farther north.</p>
        <p>Among other incidents, 30 people were injured on March 10 this year when a passenger train smashed into another train at Waterloo Station in London. Last Tuesday, 20 people were injured when a Scotrail train traveling north from Newcastle derailed after a 70-yard stretch of track was washed away by floods.</p>
        <p>The derailment this afternoon was the second of the day. This morning, an empty commuter train derailed after it hit a minibus stuck between automatic barriers at a crossing near Egham, Surrey. The van's driver and passengers jumped out at the last moment as the train bore down on them, its horn blaring, at 60 miles an hour. The train's driver suffered cuts and bruises.</p>
        <p>''It's a miracle nobody was hurt,'' said Robert Squibb, an inspector with the British Transport Police.</p>
