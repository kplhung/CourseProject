        <p>The Devils feasted on the expansion Atlanta Thrashers last season, winning all four games between the teams and outscoring Atlanta by 24 goals to 2 in perhaps the easiest cakewalk all season for the defending Stanley Cup champions.</p>
        <p>Atlanta showed some strong signs tonight that things may be different this season in its four confrontations with the Devils. The Thrashers were the better team for long stretches and skated to a 3-3 tie with the Devils at Philips Arena.</p>
        <p>The Stanley Cup champions were the dominant team in the third period but could only manage a goal by Sergei Brylin with 3 minutes 47 seconds left that earned the tie for the Devils, who have two victories, a loss and a tie in their first four games.</p>
        <p>This was just one of the numerous games the Devils were expected to face as the defending champions. Like Atlanta did tonight, everyone in the 30-team National Hockey League will be looking to upset the champions, who did not play well enough to establish their authority early in this game.</p>
        <p>Devils Coach Larry Robinson said his team did not play well considering the style of hockey the Thrashers used.</p>
        <p>''They were dumping it in and there was no room for anything,'' Robinson said. ''I think that our forwards were also a little too loose about scoring.'' The Devils' coach was also critical of his defensemen, who were trying to push the puck up ice and join the rush. That style created several odd-man rushes for Atlanta, and several headaches for Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur.</p>
        <p>''It's tough when you get behind the eight ball,'' Brodeur said. ''It's not really that bad. We still got a tie.''</p>
        <p>Atlanta scored the lone goal in the first period when Donald Audette's blistering shot from the top of the right circle went between Brodeur's legs at 5:23 of the first period. Brodeur, who was the winner in all four meetings between the teams last season, had little chance on Audette's goal, or on Ray Ferraro's power-play goal at 8:52 of the second period, which tied the score.</p>
        <p>The Devils had taken a 2-1 lead on goals 25 seconds apart by Scott Stevens and Patrik Elias.</p>
        <p>It was the first goal of the season for both Stevens and Elias. Stevens's goal came at 6:55 of the period, on the Devils' first power-play opportunity. The Devils pressed hard on the goal, swarming the net around Thrashers goaltender Damian Rhodes, and finally scoring when Stevens, alone in the slot, shot through a crowd to beat the goaltender.</p>
        <p>Elias's goal came after Sergei Nemchinov made a good move and pass from the right side. All Elias had to do was redirect the puck past Rhodes from close range.</p>
        <p>Atlanta came out with a great deal of enthusiasm in the third period and regained the lead just 42 seconds in when Tomi Kallio's shot from the right circle sailed past Brodeur.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JAY PANDOLFO is nursing a bruised left shoulder and will also miss Thursday night's game at Washington. JIM McKENZIE will take his place in the lineup. . . . It appears that CHRIS TERRERI may get a chance to make his first appearance either eight or nine games into the season, when the Devils play back-to-back games at Carolina and Pittsburgh.</p>
