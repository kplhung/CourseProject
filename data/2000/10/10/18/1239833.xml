        <p>Trying to inject a little spice into the last presidential debate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman made a hastily arranged trip here to watch the debate in person.</p>
        <p>Such a surprise, in fact, that campaign officials would not tell the reporters traveling with Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, of the change in plans until they were aboard his campaign jet in Little Rock, Ark. Even some of the senator's own traveling staff were among those kept in the dark.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore's camp was hoping to add a little unexpected drama to a confrontation already freighted with import in a race that is excruciatingly close. His advisers were also hoping that having Mr. Lieberman around, as the person with the greatest stature schmoozing the press, might dominate the pre- and post-debate spin sessions that have become a fixture of the debates.</p>
        <p>The senator strolled into the media center here an hour before the debate, and about 50 members of the news media, starved for something to report, mobbed him. He proceeded to say the same things -- about Mr. Gore's intending to outline sharp differences between him and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas -- that he has said a dozen times before.</p>
        <p>As for the surprise factor, that did not quite go according to plan. The idea was to prevent word from getting to the Republicans with enough time for them to get their own star -- like, for instance, Mr. Lieberman's counterpart, Dick Cheney -- to the debate, if they were so inclined.</p>
        <p>But before reaching the airport in Little Rock, the reporters traveling with Mr. Lieberman had figured out what was up, and called their editors. And word went out on The Associated Press news service.</p>
