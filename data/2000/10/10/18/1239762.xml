        <p>There is a new six-story building on Park Avenue four blocks south of Grand Central Terminal. It is called Scandinavia House: The Nordic Center in America. It has tinted windows and a smooth gray facade. Above all, it is well-branded.</p>
        <p>There is Volvo Hall, named after the Swedish carmaker that donated $1 million for the building's construction. There is the children's playroom with little wooden stools imprinted with the Lego logo and a six-foot Viking made from Lego blocks. And yesterday morning, the $20 million cultural center got the most auspicious branding of all: a benediction by Scandinavian royalty who rarely appear in the United States.</p>

        <p>There is a new six-story building on Park Avenue four blocks south of Grand Central Terminal. It is called Scandinavia House: The Nordic Center in America. It has tinted windows and a smooth gray facade. Above all, it is well-branded.</p>
        <p>There is Volvo Hall, named after the Swedish carmaker that donated $1 million for the building's construction. There is the children's playroom with little wooden stools imprinted with the Lego logo and a six-foot Viking made from Lego blocks. And yesterday morning, the $20 million cultural center got the most auspicious branding of all: a benediction by Scandinavian royalty who rarely appear in the United States.</p>
        <p>King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden was at the grand opening. So was Queen Silvia and their eldest daughter, Crown Princess Victoria. Princess Martha Louise of Norway and Princess Benedikte of Denmark were there, too, the latter wearing a suit as blue as her blood.</p>
        <p>There was a lot of sitting around, but not on thrones. The royals sat on a stage in a basement auditorium during a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Then they sat on an outdoor stage during the speeches and flag-waving and national anthems. Being heads of state but not heads of government, they spend a lot of time these days warming seats.</p>
        <p>''I really like the king,'' said Kirsi Paalanen, who was visiting from Finland and wearing the white-and-blue flag of her country on her lapel. ''He seems like a real down-to-earth guy.''</p>
        <p>Finland never had a monarchy. So many newspapers and magazines in that country write slavishly about the Swedish royal family. In fact, all of the Scandinavian countries closely follow the comings and goings of the family because of Sweden's historical impact on the region.</p>
        <p>It is not hard to keep track of them. They pop up everywhere in Sweden. They cut more ribbons than a sweatshop seamstress.</p>
        <p>''They turn out for openings for new train stations, or for pretty much everything,'' said Peter Karrlander, a Swedish businessman who moved to New York two months ago.</p>
        <p>''School openings, too,'' said his wife, Susanne, as she held up her country's flag.</p>
        <p>''I think it's quite normal for them to travel,'' Mr. Karrlander said. ''I would have been surprised if I didn't see them here.''</p>
        <p>''It's not like in England, where the royal family is harassed,'' his wife said.</p>
        <p>Nordic people have been traveling to North America for almost a millennium, ever since the Vikings first landed on these shores, some historians say. Scandinavia House was designed to preserve that history, and to teach people about other important cultural contributions: Hans Christian Andersen, Ingmar Bergman and Ikea, for starters.</p>
        <p>The king of Sweden called the center ''a dynamic, creative, interesting world, so far from home and yet so near.''</p>
        <p>The opening of Scandinavia House coincides with a craze in New York for all things Viking. O.K., maybe craze isn't exactly the right word. But earlier this month, Capt. Gunnar Marel Eggertsson, a direct descendant of Leif Ericson, steered a replica of a Viking ship into New York waters after an almost four-month journey from Iceland.</p>
        <p>And on Saturday, the American Museum of Natural History is scheduled to open an archaeological exhibit called ''Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga.''</p>
        <p>So the Scandinavian royals have plenty of reasons to celebrate these days. Those at yesterday's opening are expected to show up at the Grand Hyatt tonight for a fund-raiser for the American-Scandinavian Foundation, which owns Scandinavia House.</p>
        <p>People are paying anywhere from $600 to $25,000 per plate. Even if they can no longer send armies off to war or parade around all the time with crowns and scepters, the royals can sleep easy knowing that their brand is still worth something.</p>
