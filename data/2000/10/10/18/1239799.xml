        <p>Yemeni security officials have searched an apartment in Aden that they suspect was used for several days by men who may have played a role in the bombing last week that killed 17 American sailors, American officials in Washington said today.</p>
        <p>The officials said the development was potentially significant, though they cautioned that it was not yet clear whether evidence had been uncovered showing that the apartment was used to support the attack.</p>
        <p>The American ambassador, Barbara K. Bodine, told reporters at a briefing tonight that American investigators had been provided with ''some significant leads'' by Yemeni officials, and called the day's developments ''a quantum leap'' for the investigation.</p>
        <p>But she and other American officials in Aden refused to discuss the apartment search or even acknowledge that it had taken place, saying they did not wish to compromise the investigation.</p>
        <p>On the basis of the information from the Yemenis, Ambassador Bodine said, ''we are very hopeful that we are going to be able to get to the bottom'' of the apparent suicide-bombing of the sailors' ship, the Cole, as it lay moored for refueling in Aden's inner harbor on Thursday.</p>
        <p>For now, she added, ''we'll just say that we have not found all the people that may or may not have been behind this, and for that reason there may very well be people out there'' to track down.</p>
        <p>Yemeni authorities have turned over the names of at least two people who may have been involved in the attack, officials here and in Washington said, but they declined to release names or nationalities.</p>
        <p>In Washington, law enforcement authorities expressed even greater caution, saying that while the search of the apartment could be important, the investigators had not yet obtained specific evidence, either from witnesses or from forensic investigation, that pointed to any individual or group. News reports in the Middle East indicated that the Yemenis had found bomb materials at the apartment, but officials in Washington said they had not yet seen an inventory of the evidence seized.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said Yemeni investigators were also looking at a trailer and a car, and at a warehouse that might have been used in the attack.</p>
        <p>In Aden today, the Navy removed the bodies of six more sailors; five bodies have already been sent back to the United States and six are still to be recovered.</p>
        <p>Officials said examination of the Cole indicated that the explosive used was even more sophisticated than initially thought. The penetrating force and the damage deep in the interior strongly suggested that the bomb was a ''shaped charge,'' designed to focus the explosion rather than allow it to spread in all directions, as with a typical truck bomb, officials said.</p>
        <p>''With every piece of information, it becomes a more sophisticated operation,'' one official said.</p>
        <p>The officials have not disclosed the specific type of device used, though the use of a directed explosive led to speculation that the device operated like an warhead. Such a device is a more sophisticated weapon than those used by most terrorist organizations, and possibly came from a military stockpile.</p>
        <p>''I can't think of a major terrorist operation that has involved, essentially, hardware of that magnitude,'' said Daniel Benjamin, a former terrorism analyst on the National Security Council and now a senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington.</p>
        <p>A military officer with access to information about the investigation said the first interviews with people in Aden, including American sailors aboard the Cole, suggested that the attack could have involved more people than the two apparent suicide attackers who detonated the huge bomb, which was carried aboard a small boat.</p>
        <p>The official said ''a significant number of people'' in the port appeared to be aware that something was amiss because boats that would normally prowl the harbor ''cleared the area'' just before the bomb exploded. The harbor pilot, who boarded the Cole to help steer it to the refueling station, was ''acting really nervous -- kind of anxious to get off the ship,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Those interviewed also reported seeing an unusual number of people on the piers and on the beach, watching the refueling. The official said that was in contrast to previous refueling visits and had raised suspicions among investigators.</p>
        <p>Divers with specialized naval metal-cutters finally broke through water-filled compartments and a mass of tangled steel today to recover the six additional bodies. The Cole's crew draped the bodies with American flags before putting them on a small boat that carried them ashore.</p>
        <p>Rear Adm. Mark Fitzgerald, the task force commander overseeing the recovery operation, said the search team has a strong hunch where the remaining bodies are, and hopes to recover them quickly. The bodies of five other sailors were flown to Dover, Del., on Saturday.</p>
        <p>President Clinton is to attend a Navy memorial service for the victims on Wednesday in Norfolk, Va.</p>
        <p>A senior American officer said that as part of the investigation, Yemeni authorities had also turned over videotapes from security cameras in the harbor. The cameras captured some activity that might be useful to investigators, but the officer said the evidence might not be conclusive.</p>
        <p>Still the officer and others cited the sharing of the tapes as signs of Yemen's cooperation.</p>
        <p>Senator Carl M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, praised the cooperation shown so far. He was responding to a call by Representative C. W. Young of Florida, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, to condition $4 million in aid to Yemen on the government's cooperation with the investigation.</p>
        <p>Senator Levin said that he had spoken with Ambassador Bodine and with Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of American forces in the region, in the last 24 hours and that both had assured him that the Yemeni authorities were ''fully, actively and completely cooperating.''</p>
        <p>''Yemeni officials in Aden provided information to Ambassador Bodine concerning specific perpetrators who carried out this attack,'' Senator Levin wrote in a letter to Representative Young and Representative Sonny Callahan of Alabama, the Republican who is chairman of the appropriations subcommittee overseeing foreign aid. ''Ambassador Bodine described this information to me as 'vital, critical and fundamental.' ''</p>
        <p>He added that Ambassador Bodine had told him the information would be useful to finding who backed the bombing. In the letter and in an interview today, Senator Levin said he believed that legislation linking aid to Yemen to its cooperation could prove counterproductive.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to suggest that we used some kind of club to get cooperation we're already getting,'' he said.</p>
