        <p>In a friendly deal that will create one of the world's biggest power companies, Grupo Endesa of Spain agreed today to acquire a domestic rival, Iberdrola, for stock and cash worth about $12.7 billion.</p>
        <p>The acquisition has been in the works for some time. But the agreement was accelerated after GasNatural SDG, Spain's dominant supplier of natural gas, sought to break up the deal late Monday with a rival proposal to buy Iberdrola. GasNatural's main shareholder is Repsol YPF, Spain's biggest oil company.</p>
        <p>Endesa's purchase of Iberdrola, which still requires regulatory and shareholder approval, reflects the tumult in Europe created by the deregulation of the power industry. Battles for control of power companies are now cutting across borders, and the Spanish government has indicated it wants to keep Spain's power industry in Spanish hands.</p>
        <p>GasNatural had hoped its merger proposal would persuade Iberdrola's board with the argument that the combination of GasNatural's gas distribution network and Iberdrola's power-generation capabilities would create a powerful competitor in Europe. But the Endesa-Iberdrola deal had already advanced too far.</p>
        <p>''We will have a Spanish company of world importance in the sector and our merger is aimed at boosting value for our shareholders and benefiting the Spanish consumer,'' Iberdrola's president, Inigo de Oriol, told a news conference here.</p>
        <p>GasNatural and Repsol had no comment.</p>
        <p>The merger would rank as one of the biggest power industry mergers, second in Europe only to the purchase of the Viag utility of Germany in June by Veba, creating E.ON.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the Endesa-Iberdrola deal, Iberdrola shareholders will receive 18 Endesa shares and 0.15 euro for every 23 Iberdrola shares they own. That is worth 16.82 euros a share, or $14, at current exchange rates, 21 percent more than their value on Sept. 26, a day before Endesa said it was in talks with Iberdrola. Based on Iberdrola's 901.5 million shares outstanding, the deal is worth about $12.7 billion.</p>
        <p>The stock of both companies was suspended today on the Madrid exchange. Endesa closed Monday at 21.49 euros, or about $18, and Iberdrola closed at 15.34 euros, or about $12.89.</p>
        <p>The Spanish companies said they would call their combination Endesa-Iberdrola, to be based in Madrid. To gain approval from regulators concerned about the merged company's dominance in electric power, Endesa and Iberdrola said they would sell unspecified electricity assets ''to facilitate the entrance of new agents in the market and increase competition for the good of consumers.''</p>
        <p>Endesa-Iberdrola would have a combined market value of 37 billion euros and control around 80 percent of Spain's electrical power distribution market.</p>
        <p>Endesa, with around 9.8 million customers, is strong in the northeast and south of Spain, while Iberdrola, which serves 8.3 million clients, is mostly active in the Basque region, and in the center and southeast of the country. Union Fenosa and Hidrocantabrico share the rest of the domestic market.</p>
