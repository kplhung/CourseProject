      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>IN the middle of the Loire Valley, from the Anjou region east past Tours, the greatness and versatility of chenin blanc is revealed. This grape, which has a reputation for making dull, indifferent wines elsewhere in the world, produces wines in this region that are light and crisp, and others that are nearly dry but for their slightly honeyed finish. They can be sparkling and refreshing or they can be thick and luscious enough to have for dessert.</p>
        <p>Just north of the Loire and southwest of Angers is Savennieres, a tiny appellation that produces perhaps the most concentrated, powerful examples of chenin blanc. Savennieres are often described as grown-up wines. Unlike, say, the innocent, easy to enjoy chenin blancs of Vouvray, Savennieres are not lightly likable.</p>

        <p>IN the middle of the Loire Valley, from the Anjou region east past Tours, the greatness and versatility of chenin blanc is revealed. This grape, which has a reputation for making dull, indifferent wines elsewhere in the world, produces wines in this region that are light and crisp, and others that are nearly dry but for their slightly honeyed finish. They can be sparkling and refreshing or they can be thick and luscious enough to have for dessert.</p>
        <p>Just north of the Loire and southwest of Angers is Savennieres, a tiny appellation that produces perhaps the most concentrated, powerful examples of chenin blanc. Savennieres are often described as grown-up wines. Unlike, say, the innocent, easy to enjoy chenin blancs of Vouvray, Savennieres are not lightly likable.</p>
        <p>You have to stick with them, past the surprisingly dry and steely first taste that can sometimes seem like a closed gate. Keep tasting, and the wine's depth begins to reveal itself. First comes the texture, unusually thick and rich for a white wine, and then a range of flavors that encompasses sweet, spicy, floral and mineral.</p>
        <p>Savennieres are among those rare white wines with the capacity to age for a couple of decades or more. Recently, I stumbled onto a bottle of Nicolas Joly Clos de la Coulee de Serrant 1991. This was admittedly not a good year in the Loire, a circumstance that might explain the slight shrillness of the flavors, but the oily texture and the wealth of aromas like almonds, wax and hay hinted at the splendid potential of an aged bottle from a good vintage, like 1996.</p>
        <p>The Coulee de Serrant 1996 is already full of toasty mineral flavors, in contrast to the 1998 Domaine du Closel, in which a fresh apple scent dominates.</p>
        <p>The number of Savennieres producers is few and their output is small, so you won't find a wide selection. But they are worth the time it takes to know them.</p>
        <p>NICOLAS JOLY, CLOS DE LA COULEE DE SERRANT 1996: $60  Smoky, almost caramel aroma; almost austerely dry.</p>
        <p>DOMAINE DES BAUMARD, TRIE SPECIALE 1997: $30  Depth and breadth, thick texture; mineral, floral and honey flavors.</p>
        <p>DOMAINE DU CLOSEL, CLOS DU PAPILLON 1998: $17  Fresh apple and chalk aromas; apple and honey flavors.</p>
        <p>PIERRE-YVES TIJOU, CLOS DES PERRIERES 1996: $23  Apple and mineral aromas; rich, thick texture; tart citrus flavor.</p>
        <p>DOMAINE DES BAUMARD, CLOS DU PAPILLON 1997: $20  Dry and firm, with richness and depth; a bit unfocused.</p>
        <p>NICOLAS JOLY, BECHERELLE 1997: $23  Smoky, flinty aroma, austere and minerally; flavor of baked apples.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various wine shops in the New York region.</p>
