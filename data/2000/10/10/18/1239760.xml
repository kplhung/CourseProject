        <p>They had spent almost a quarter of their season on the edge, consistently winning the close, low-scoring games that were supposed to be the stuff of nostalgia. When the Mets hit September, they had the best record in the National League. Who cared if they could pitch and field but only get just enough hits?</p>
        <p>It began falling apart when John Franco, who had an extraordinary summer, went down for two weeks with a sore pectoral muscle. With one piece removed from their prized bullpen, the Mets wobbled. Three teams passed them in the standing, and the Mets' offense was missing.</p>
        <p>They did not look like a team that would soon be perfecting the Champagne celebration.</p>
        <p>''We kind of reinvented ourselves after the slow start in September,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said. ''I think guys have much fresher minds now.''</p>
        <p>Most of the Mets' minds were a little groggy yesterday, after the team clinched the National League pennant with a 7-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series on Monday  night.</p>
        <p>Phillips, who spoke in a telephone news conference from his Connecticut home, said he slept until 1 p.m. for the first time in his life. The team will work out at 1 p.m. today at Shea Stadium, but yesterday was a day to rest.</p>
        <p>When the Mets open the World Series on the road Saturday -- possibly at Yankee Stadium in the first Subway Series since 1956 -- they will be playing their best baseball of the season. They went 26-10 from July 25 until the end of August, but scored four runs or fewer in 22 of the 36 games.</p>
        <p>Against the Cardinals, the Mets scored at least six runs in each of their four victories. Edgardo Alfonzo batted .444 in the N.L.C.S. Mike Piazza hit .412. Todd Zeile hit .368 with eight runs batted in. Robin Ventura had only three hits, but knocked in five runs. Timo Perez scored eight times.</p>
        <p>Phillips believes teams win in the postseason not with pitching and defense -- ''You expect good pitching in these games,'' he said -- but with offense. His team proved him right against St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''We're playing well, and we're playing as a team,'' Phillips said. ''The nice thing right now is we're getting contributions from everyone, offensively and defensively. We have the depth of our lineup right now where we have a chance to score in every inning and be a threat in every inning.</p>
        <p>''We're making the opposing pitcher throw more pitches, and even if we don't score, having those opportunities takes a toll on the opposing pitching staff.''</p>
        <p>Perez, the leadoff man, is batting .300 and has only one walk in 41 plate appearances this postseason. But over all, the Mets have shown patience, drawing 27 walks in the N.L.C.S. to the Cardinals' 11. They are sustaining rallies, and the pitching and defense have been stellar.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine, speaking amid a deluge of Champagne in the clubhouse on Monday, said he saw the charts before the series that gave the edge to the Cardinals in several areas. ''They forgot that one big check,'' Valentine said, ''and that's where the word 'team' is.''</p>
        <p>Valentine had reason to be proud. Even with a 6-12 stretch to start September, the Mets won 94 games, one fewer than the Cardinals and the Atlanta Braves, three fewer than the San Francisco Giants. They settled for the wild card after failing to topple the Braves in the N.L. East, but the postseason was in view all along.</p>
        <p>''We weren't thinking about the wild card,'' the veteran reserve Lenny Harris said. ''We had one goal -- let's win it all for Bobby V.''</p>
        <p>Having perspective on the pennant race gave Valentine a chance to rest Alfonzo, Piazza and others, and Phillips said he has come to appreciate the wisdom in that.</p>
        <p>In last year's N.L.C.S. against the Braves, Alfonzo and Piazza combined to hit .196; this year against the Cardinals, they hit .429. The Mets are soaring in part because they are strong.</p>
        <p>''It's not only from a physical standpoint, it's from an emotional and mental standpoint, too,'' said Phillips, noting last year's frenetic entry into the postseason with a one-game playoff. ''Losing seven in a row at the end of the year and fighting through it, that took an emotional toll.''</p>
        <p>Fresh in body and mind, the Mets will be preparing for the World Series today.</p>
        <p>Mike Hampton, who threw 16 shutout innings to win the N.L.C.S. most valuable player award, will probably start in Game 1, with Al Leiter going in Game 2. That alignment was successful in the first two rounds of the playoffs, and Hampton will have his four days' rest by Saturday.</p>
        <p>Another reason the Mets will probably pick Hampton for Game 1 -- that starter would also start Game 5 at Shea Stadium, where National League rules keep the pitcher in the batting order. Hampton is a .274 hitter. The designated hitter will be used in the American League park.</p>
        <p>''The D.H., no-D.H. factor is something to sort through, where pitchers hit in some ballparks,'' Phillips said. ''Do you consider it with your best-hitting pitcher, letting him hit in the N.L. park? I'm not proposing that; it's just one of the questions.''</p>
        <p>The Mets will need to choose a designated hitter for the games at the A.L. park. Harris and Darryl Hamilton are logical options against a right-handed starter; the Mets could have Todd Pratt catch and use Mike Piazza as the D.H. against a left-hander. Bubba Trammell is another right-handed-hitting D.H. option.</p>
        <p>The roster could stay the same. Phillips said the only issue is whether the Mets want to add an 11th pitcher and drop a position player. The long reliever Pat Mahomes had been left off the roster so far, with the left-hander Glendon Rusch filling that role.</p>
        <p>Valentine said he would be comfortable starting Rusch, presumably instead of the right-hander Bobby J. Jones, who struggled in Game 4 of the N.L.C.S. after his one-hitter to close out the division series. But Valentine also likes Rusch in the bullpen, and Phillips indicated he could stay there.</p>
        <p>''It's open for debate, but he really thrived in the role that he was in,'' Phillips said. ''You'd have to consider that if you do start him, you don't have him available in the role he did well.''</p>
