        <p>New York City's two most influential fiscal watchdog groups gave contrasting reviews yesterday on the $3.8 billion transportation bond act on the state's Nov. 7 ballot.</p>
        <p>The separate reports, by the city-financed Independent Budget Office and the private Citizens Budget Commission, said the borrowing proposal would provide city residents with a windfall in transit financing, but would also push the state's debt load dangerously high. While the budget office took no position, it pointed out financial advantages for city residents. The commission, on the other hand, recommended voters reject the bond issue.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gave the bond act a lukewarm endorsement last week, but it has been condemned by other officials, including the Staten Island borough president, Guy V. Molinari, who say it provides too few specifics on how the money would be spent.</p>
        <p>If approved, the act would authorize state officials to raise $3.8 billion through general obligation bonds, with the proceeds to be divided almost evenly between state highway and bridge projects and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  The money dedicated to the M.T.A. would reduce the amount of the agency's own borrowing, and would pay for several subway and commuter rail projects, including engineering work on the proposed Second Avenue subway in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The report yesterday by Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of city government that was created in 1996, said taxpayers in the city would pay 40 percent of the debt payments on the state bonds, but would directly benefit from 44 percent of the transportation projects that would be financed.</p>
        <p>The Independent Budget Office estimated that city residents would pay 48 percent of the debt payments if the bond act is defeated.</p>
        <p>The Independent Budget Office estimated that city residents would pay 48 percent of the debt payments if the bond act is defeated and the debt payments are assumed by the M.T.A. and the State Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>Although the Citizens Budget Commission did not provide detailed analysis of how money would be distributed under the bond act, it said voters should reject it on principle, citing what it called a ''danger zone'' in debt financing. It said the debts of both the city and state had more than doubled since 1990, and recommended that the state reduce its level of borrowing.</p>
        <p>''It is often assumed that if government is not in danger of defaulting on its debt, then its debt is not too large,'' said Charles Brecher, the group's research director. ''A jurisdiction's debt level, however, has a great impact on its competitiveness.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Ronnie Lowenstein, the chief economist for the Independent Budget Office, said, ''There is no question that the biggest reason to vote against the act would be concern over the state's debt position.''</p>
        <p>But if the act is rejected, she said, alternative financing would probably not be found for all the transportation improvements now contemplated by city and state agencies.</p>
        <p>Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said the Independent Budget Office's report ''misses the point'' in its comparison of benefits for city and state residents.</p>
        <p>She added that ''city taxpayers should be as worried as any other taxpayers in the state about a debt level that is just too high.''</p>
