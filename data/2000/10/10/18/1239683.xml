        <p>JOE DIMAGGIO  The Hero's Life  By Richard Ben Cramer  Illustrated. 548 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $28.</p>
        <p>For those people accustomed to taking their heroes as the embodiments of the simple virtues, Richard Ben Cramer's relentlessly iconoclastic new biography of Joe DiMaggio, one of the greatest American heroes, will tarnish more than just an idol. It will tarnish the American myth, make it appear a manufactured product of wishful thinking and commercialism. DiMaggio, in Mr. Cramer's penetrating and unforgiving illumination of him, is a scowling, calculating and sometimes cruel phantom lurking behind the splendid image created more by collective  need than by reality.</p>
        <p>Most of Mr. Cramer's effective dismantling of both the DiMaggio and the American myths comes in his last chapters, grouped under the heading ''The Greatest Living . . .'' It covers the last decade or so of the Yankee Clipper's long life, when, in the public's eyes, he waved graciously from the pedestal he deserved, occasionally selling coffee and banking services to make a living. In fact, as Mr. Cramer sees it, that decade was a time when DiMaggio turned his back on old friends, broke his relationships with his son and with his brother Dominic and grabbed the monetary and other emoluments of his hero status with a sense of entitlement bigger than the Ritz.</p>
        <p>The DiMaggio that seeps through the pages of ''Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life'' is the kind of man who could be given a luxury car by one Cappy Harada, the grateful promoter of an event that DiMaggio blessed with his godlike presence.  ''It's your brand-new Cadillac! I got it parked for you, right outside,'' Mr. Cramer has Mr. Harada gushing.</p>
        <p>''Joe looked from the keys to Cappy without sitting up, without a smile, without moving his head an extra inch. Joe said: 'Did you fill it up with gas?' ''</p>
        <p>The book in this sense is in the muckraking tradition, but he has written something more than a definitive revisionist biography of a cultural archetype. Mr. Cramer, a journalist whose previous book was ''What It Takes: The Way to the White House,'' has furnished us with a grand American tale, its ingredients including struggling immigrants from Sicily, the limitless dimensions to which talent can aspire, the possibility that dreams can be realized, and baseball. He writes with utter command, adopting a kind of guys-in-the-clubhouse voice, part of an effort to reincarnate the interior monologues of his characters.</p>
        <p>''Joe DiMaggio'' is a cross between Ring Lardner and David Halberstam with dollops of Dreiser and Hemingway thrown in for good measure. The voice verges on the affected from time to time: ''The way Toots saw it, there were only two guys who could walk into his joint and everything stopped. Jack Dempsey was one, and Daig'' (Dimaggio's nickname, based on the familiar slur) was the other. But for the most part Mr. Cramer gets us through his long and assiduously researched narrative in brisk and lively fashion, capturing the beat of mid-century America as he proceeds.</p>
        <p>He begins with DiMaggio as a San Francisco teenager, indifferent to school, unwilling to join his fisherman father on his boat, staying largely silent and aloof among his friends. Mr. Cramer contends that a gloss of mythology has been layered retroactively even over the early phases of the DiMaggio story so that he could be the plucky hero we need.  Among the myths was that DiMaggio got into baseball because he was a boy who loved only baseball. By contrast, Mr. Cramer discerns from the beginning a powerful streak of financial calculation in DiMaggio, who was, in the author's view, always more of a calculator of self-interest than a real enthusiast.</p>
        <p>''Joe was going to take care of business because he could treat the game as business,'' Mr. Cramer writes. ''It wasn't all tied up in his head with friends and the neighborhood, playground days and glorious dreams at night.''</p>
        <p>In any case, he was a natural whose rapid rise from Bay Area semi-pro ball to center field at Yankee Stadium is one of the several anecdote-rich and atmospheric narratives told by Mr. Cramer. The main outlines of the story are familiar, but the author adds an investigative reporter's edge to it, showing how as young Joe tore up the American League he moved as effortlessly into the hero's role as he did under a fly ball in the outfield.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cramer traces his embrace by New York's celebrity-conscious saloon keepers, most notably Toots Shor; his adoption as a kind of hero-mascot by known mobsters like Richie (the Boot) Boiardo of Newark, who gave him gifts simply because he was who he was; his first marriage, to Dorothy Arnold, whom he persuaded to give up her career for his sake and then effectively ignored until she left him.</p>
        <p>The author writes vividly about DiMaggio's career as a player, the central element in his rise to superhero status being his 56-game hitting streak in 1941, viewed by more than a few sports historians as the greatest baseball exploit ever. It was the hitting streak, in Mr. Cramer's view, that later ''shone as portent of America's brilliant rise to superpower, and made DiMaggio her poster boy for valor, victory, and God-given grace.'' Mr. Cramer details the enormous extent of the public adulation of DiMaggio, the way he was so worshiped that he came to see it as natural that he would pay for virtually nothing.</p>
        <p>Some remarkable small events arose from this exalted condition as DiMaggio and the press conspired silently together to foster the myth of classical perfection and heroic goodness. There was, for example, the famous story of the boy in the hospital supposedly cured, according to the newspapers, by DiMaggio's promise to tie the hitting streak record for him -- except that Mr. Cramer finds that the boy died before the record-tying game began.</p>
        <p>There is much more, including DiMaggio's resentment at being taken away from the life he loved in New York by his service in the military during World War II. (His brief tour consisted of playing baseball in Hawaii.) The book provides a full account of the savory story of Joe and Marilyn, DiMaggio and Monroe. DiMaggio appears often enough as a narrow-minded tyrant here, but he also gains our sympathy because of the reality of his suffering. The author then skips the quarter-century between Monroe's death in 1962 and 1989, when he picks up DiMaggio's life as a kind of robber baron, assiduously converting his extraordinary celebrity into considerable wealth while resenting anybody who managed to share in the profits.</p>
        <p>Here as elsewhere, Mr. Cramer never lets us forget that DiMaggio's greatness on the field was only one part of the picture. The other part was American fabulism, our need for images of imperial majesty arising out of the melting pot.</p>
        <p>''For it was always about how we felt . . . with Joe,'' Mr. Cramer writes near the end, in a crisp summary of his overall theme. ''No wonder we strove for 60 years to give him the hero's life. It was always about us.  Alas, it was his destiny to know that, as well.''</p>
