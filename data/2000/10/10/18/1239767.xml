        <p>Derek Bell knew better than to call the Mets clubhouse on Monday, after his teammates won the National League championship without him. Bell, who reached the World Series with Toronto in 1992, knows how celebrations can be.</p>
        <p>''I knew I wasn't going to have a chance last night,'' Bell said yesterday. ''Nobody was going to answer the phone.''</p>
        <p>This would seem to be a difficult time for Bell, who had a team-high 546 at-bats in the regular season but injured himself only one at-bat into the postseason. Bell sustained a high ankle sprain in Game 1 of the division series at San Francisco, and his right ankle swelled considerably on the flight back to New York.</p>
        <p>Wearing street clothes and on crutches, Bell took part in the pregame introductions at Shea Stadium on Oct. 7. But being virtually immobile and with his injury worse, Bell returned home to Tampa, Fla., where he will stay through the World Series.</p>
        <p>''I'll come up when they have the parade, though,'' Bell said.</p>
        <p>Bell spoke by telephone from his home, where he has spent the days playing video games and watching the Mets on television with friends. He spends an hour a day rehabilitating the ankle, but can put no pressure on it and will not be able to do so for about two weeks.</p>
        <p>Bell has been checking in with his teammate Lenny Harris, talking about hitters' mechanics, and which players are hot and which are not. ''I tell him to give them a kiss for me when someone does something good,'' Bell said.</p>
        <p>One Met playing consistently well is Timo Perez, the rookie who replaced Bell in right field and has hit .300 this postseason. If it has been bittersweet to watch his replacement become a folk hero, Bell did not say so.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to give him a big kiss when I see him,'' Bell said. ''I knew he could play. Darryl Hamilton told me, so I knew he had the potential to do something really good. I'm proud of him.''</p>
        <p>Perez's emergence has made it less likely that the Mets will re-sign Bell, a free agent this winter, who batted .266 but hit only .187 in the second half. Perez, Benny Agbayani and Jay Payton give the Mets an inexpensive starting outfield, freeing up money to re-sign the starting pitcher Mike Hampton and make a run at Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who will be a free agent.</p>
        <p>But Bell wants to return. ''All that stuff about how hard it is to play in New York, it's a myth,'' he said. ''They're the best fans in baseball when you've got them on your side and you're playing hard.''</p>
        <p>Bell also enjoyed his time with Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, whose contract also expires Oct. 31. Bell would like to package his deal with his manager's. ''I'm going to try to go wherever Bobby Valentine goes,'' Bell said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Payton Feeling Fine</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips said center fielder Jay Payton was fine after being beaned by the St. Louis right-hander Dave Veres in the eighth inning on Monday. Payton needed three stitches to close a gash over his left eyebrow.</p>
        <p>''He won't have any limitations,'' said Phillips, adding that he did not believe Veres threw at Payton intentionally.</p>
        <p>Ticket Mix-Up at Shea</p>
        <p>Mark Bingham, the Mets' senior vice president for marketing and broadcasting, reported to work at 8:30 a.m. yesterday, beating every other top official to the office. He may want to sleep in now.</p>
        <p>Bingham arrived to find about 500 Mets fans, by his rough count, lined up outside ticket windows that were not going to open. He explained to the fans that tickets will be sold by telephone only -- a tough argument to make to fans who had camped out all night.</p>
        <p>''I was very impressed with them,'' Bingham said. ''They disagreed with what I said, but they asked me questions and listened.''</p>
        <p>Bingham explained the Mets' belief that the safest and fairest way for fans to get tickets is over the phone. But the misunderstanding might have been avoided had Bingham heard something Tim McCarver apparently said on the Fox broadcast Monday night.</p>
        <p>''In about the seventh inning, McCarver said fans were already lining up outside,'' Bingham said. ''He just made an observation. I guess people heard that and thought that meant they were lining up for a good reason. If I'd heard that, I probably would have gone into the booth and asked Tim to make a clarification.''</p>
        <p>In reality, Mets tickets will go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday by telephone only. Fans may purchase a maximum of four for one game by calling (718) 507-TIXX. The cost per ticket is $160 or $110, with a $6 service charge per ticket.</p>
