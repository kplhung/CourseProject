        <p>This year's theme for Agenda, a computer industry conference that annually draws some of high technology's best and brightest, is supposed to be ''Who's got the juice?''</p>
        <p>But for most participants, caught in the dreadful stock market downturn of an industry once thought to be the shining symbol of a long economic boom, the theme has instead become ''Where did the juice go?''</p>
        <p>The confusion and rancor has been evident in remarks by executives who were once the darlings of Wall Street and now feel under siege.</p>
        <p>In the past, the conference has been a setting for the likes of William H. Gates of Microsoft, Steven P. Jobs of Apple Computer, Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems and Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle to lay out broad and sometimes contentious visions of computing's future.</p>
        <p>But this year, with many of the brightest Internet stocks down 50 percent or more from their highs a year ago -- and some e-commerce stocks off 90 percent -- the mood has been unusually subdued.</p>
        <p>There was more bad news today, as Intel reported earnings and forecast a relatively soft holiday season, and I.B.M. told of a revenue shortfall. [Pages C14 and C8.]</p>
        <p>And among the computer industry and Internet executives, venture capitalists and industry analysts at the conference here, there has been a sobering realization that the heady times of the past half-decade might not return any time soon.</p>
        <p>''For many of these people, this is welcome to the N.F.L.,'' said John Shoch, an experienced venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif. ''People are getting hurt and getting carried off the field, when many of them thought they were playing touch football.''</p>
        <p>In a keynote address to the invitation-only gathering of 400 executives this morning, Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, acknowledged that the downturn had hurt Microsoft's ability to keep some of its best programmers.</p>
        <p>''I think the big problem is not where stock prices are,'' he said. ''The big problem, from an employee perspective, is where stock prices were.''</p>
        <p>But for the software giant, whose stock peaked just short of $120 at the end of last year and now hovers around $50, the chastened Internet economy also holds a bit of good news. ''I think that some of the mentality that existed six months ago,'' Mr. Ballmer said, ''that said every start-up is going to be an I.P.O. and every start-up is going to have a minimum market cap of $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion -- I think some of that mentality is gone, which is good.''</p>
        <p>The changing mentality has definitely altered the landscape for Microsoft, which not long ago was one of Wall Street's gold standards, eagerly sought after as one of the two or three fixtures of the high-technology firmament.</p>
        <p>That was underscored this morning in the announcement that Microsoft and Intel had fallen from the top 10 holdings of the nation's largest actively managed mutual fund, Fidelity Magellan, in the third quarter. On Monday alone, Microsoft's stock was off 6 percent, and Intel's almost 12 percent.</p>
        <p>Intel's chief executive, Craig R. Barrett, was among those speaking at the conference here. But in an unusual reflection of the markets' sensitivity, he kept his remarks off the record, citing the company's impending earnings report.</p>
        <p>Even executives of companies that have largely survived the downturn unscathed, like Sun, joked nervously that they were adjusting their strategies to allow for the steep declines of Internet and electronic commerce start-ups.</p>
        <p>''We used to say we were the dot in dot-com,'' said Edward J. Zander, the president and chief operating officer of Sun. ''Now we say we're the 'o' in the old economy.''</p>
        <p>For industry veterans like Steve Kirsch, who founded his first successful company in 1981 and more recently created Infoseek, an early Internet highflier, the rapid shift has created a new more charged atmosphere that is a painful shift from the go-go days of last fall.</p>
        <p>''The downturn creates this tension in which people are asking, 'Am I going to be next?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>What was particularly troubling, he said, was that he knew of e-commerce companies that had doubled revenue month over month from $500,000 to $1 million but had nonetheless had been cut off by venture capitalists unwilling to continue to sustain losses over a long period.</p>
        <p>''The pace has clearly slowed,'' said Richard A. Shaffer, a computer industry analyst at Technologic Partners, where he follows the venture capital industry. ''I don't think there is fear and loathing, but there is growing concern that good companies may need private capital for quite a while.''</p>
        <p>In one panel discussion today, a group of leading Wall Street technology analysts squirmed on stage while their past recommendations were called into question.</p>
        <p>Henry Blodgett, a Merrill Lynch analyst who made his name as one of the first Wall Street analysts to discover Amazon.com, defended his forecasts. ''It's been awesome value creation,'' he said. ''The only anomaly has been late 1999 and the first quarter of 2000.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, there was general uncertainty about where the downturn might end. ''I don't know where the bottom is,'' said David Readerman, a managing director at Thomas Weisel Partners, a San Francisco investment firm. ''We need some stability to regain some confidence.''</p>
        <p>There were other signs of a slowdown in the hallways here this year. ''This is the first year in some time I've been able to use a pay phone,'' said one executive, noting that in the past so many deals were being made that the phone banks were thronged.</p>
        <p>Still, several venture capitalists attending the conference pointed out that the so-called Internet bubble applied most closely to the e-commerce market and that there were still technology segments -- they pointed today to wireless broadband and optical networking -- that were hot.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the popular world view here seemed to be of a wave theory -- with another crest still ahead -- rather than of a bubble bursting. And many attendees said they still saw a lot of technology innovation just over the horizon.</p>
        <p>At the same time they acknowledged that a growing atmosphere of caution was the order of the day, at least in the short run.</p>
        <p>For example, Stewart Alsop, a partner at New Enterprise Associates in Menlo Park, Calif., said that although his firm had just closed a $2.2 billion investment round, the largest early-round investment fund ever raised, the partners had decided at a recent meeting to go slow in their investment strategy.</p>
        <p>''We plan to wait three or four months because of all of the market turbulence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Alsop insisted that he remained a big believer in the future of the Internet. ''This is an immutable thing,'' he said. ''There are still plenty of multibillion-dollar firms left in our future.''</p>
