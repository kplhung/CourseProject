        <p>IN the last month or so, Roz Chast has had half a dozen cartoons published in The New Yorker. No news there -- happens all the time. She has also ushered her son and daughter into another school year. No news there, either -- happens every year. And been a featured entertainer on a trans-Atlantic cruise. Now that's news, if not the stuff of a Roz Chast cartoon. But that is not the big news.</p>
        <p>No, the big news is that she has not yet had a chance to look at her biggest cartoon yet: an eight-foot-high doodle of a woman trapped in a shopping bag that is hanging over the marquee of the Ethel Barrymore Theater on West 47th Street. Not that she hasn't had reports.</p>

        <p>IN the last month or so, Roz Chast has had half a dozen cartoons published in The New Yorker. No news there -- happens all the time. She has also ushered her son and daughter into another school year. No news there, either -- happens every year. And been a featured entertainer on a trans-Atlantic cruise. Now that's news, if not the stuff of a Roz Chast cartoon. But that is not the big news.</p>
        <p>No, the big news is that she has not yet had a chance to look at her biggest cartoon yet: an eight-foot-high doodle of a woman trapped in a shopping bag that is hanging over the marquee of the Ethel Barrymore Theater on West 47th Street. Not that she hasn't had reports.</p>
        <p>''Friends of my parents keep calling up,'' Ms. Chast said, laughing. ''And each time, it gets bigger and bigger.''</p>
        <p>The ''it'' in that sentence was the size of the cartoon, not the laughter; as in a fish story, the size of the cartoon somehow balloons with each telling. The cartoon is, in fact, a marquee advertisement -- the first Ms. Chast has done in her career, which includes 22 years of drawing for The New Yorker -- for ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' Charles Busch's comic dissection of an overeducated, understimulated Upper West Side couple played by Linda Lavin and Tony Roberts. The show, now in previews, opens on Nov. 2. And logistics and deadlines for her other projects made it easier for her to imagine herself in front of the marquee than for her to be photographed there.</p>
        <p>No wonder the play struck a responsive chord. The marquee depicts a frazzled-looking Ms. Lavin peering out of a giant shopping bag emblazoned with the logos of such socially attuned -- or socially stunted -- clubs as ''The West Side-Wine Tasting-Werner Herzog-Obsessed Support Group'' and ''Proud Parents of Lovely, Smart Children Who, for Some Reason, Are Still Finding Themselves.'' (Neither actually exists. Yet. Do not call Ms. Chast for information.)</p>
        <p>''It's a very New York play, and most of my characters seemed to intersect with them,'' she said. ''I mean, it's not really my world, but it's not so different, either.''</p>
        <p>That was just how the marketing team assigned to sell the play to the public was hoping she would react.</p>
        <p>''We were thinking it through and suddenly thought, 'This is totally Roz Chast,' '' said Mark Burdett, an art director at Spotco, the show's advertising agency. ''I mean, some of the show seemed to be a living Roz Chast cartoon.''</p>
        <p>BUT Ms. Chast said the billboard didn't just leap to the page.  She hadn't seen the original production at Manhattan Theater Club, where the play had a successful run this spring, so she had to work from the script and production photos. Perhaps that was why her main challenge was finding just the right level of existential angst.</p>
        <p>''It was a matter of degrees of strickenness,'' Ms. Chast said. ''One too many lines around the mouth and she looks ready for Bellevue.''</p>
        <p>So the woman in the bag went through several different drafts, some more worried around the eyes, until Ms. Chast found the look of psychological puzzlement.</p>
        <p>The marquee is Ms. Chast's Broadway debut -- ''Do I sing or dance? That's a question of definition'' -- and just her latest adventure in drawing. Her career began in 1978, a year after she graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design. It was then that she submitted -- and sold -- her first cartoon to The New Yorker, a panel whose quirky scrawl and offbeat humor sparked something of a scandal for readers more used to erudite, well-penned wit. Subscriptions were canceled, letters were shot off, but Ms. Chast's popularity -- and the loyalty of her editor, Lee Lorenz -- prevailed.</p>
        <p>Since then, she has published several collections of her cartoons and illustrated a dozen books, most recently ''Rationalizations to Live By,'' by Henry Beard, Andy Borowitz and John Boswell (Workman Publishing, 2000).</p>
        <p>Ms. Chast is a woman who speaks in captions. Almost every line is good enough to be a punch line in one of her cartoons. A 45-year-old woman with glasses and a high-school yearbook smile, she says that her success has been a happy accident. ''I don't think of myself as a huge force in graphic design,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She lives in Ridgefield, Conn., and says that a goodly part of her energy -- and that of her husband, Bill -- is devoted to keeping up with her two children, Ian, 13, and Nina, 9. (She called their daily return from school ''the onslaught.'')</p>
        <p>Her sustained run in The New Yorker has opened the door to a range of opportunities over the years, from Broadway marquees to, no kidding, a recent stint as a special guest on the Queen Elizabeth II, as part of a specialty cruise with the daunting title of ''The Limits of Human Endurance.'' In a logic known only to cruise experts, the other guests included a North Pole explorer and an expert on Stonehenge.</p>
        <p>''I had to sketch people's lives on command,'' Ms. Chast said. ''People would line up and say, 'I'm building a house, and it's on a hill and I keep putting money into it and nothing happens. See what you can do with that.' It was only an hour a day, but any more I would have been jumping off the side of the ship.''</p>
        <p>When she and her family finally returned from sea, Ms. Chast said, she considered swinging by the Barrymore to take a look at that marquee. But she opted to save that experience for another time.</p>
        <p>''We used to go to the theater more pre-kid,'' Ms. Chast said. ''But we'll be there on opening night.''</p>
