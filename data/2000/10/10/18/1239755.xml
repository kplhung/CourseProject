        <p>The emergency summit meeting that ended yesterday in Egypt proved as tense and difficult as advertised. But Israel and the Palestinians emerged from it with a fragile new opportunity to end nearly three weeks of traumatic clashes that have killed more than 100 people. Doing so can be a first step toward rebuilding the trust that will be needed to negotiate a more permanent peace.</p>
        <p>The bloody confrontations have so strained relations between Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, that the two found it almost impossible to speak to each other directly. They conducted most of their business through President Clinton. The meeting ended without the two leaders making a joint statement. Instead Mr. Clinton announced their mutual undertakings to the world, then departed without answering any questions from the press.</p>
        <p>The understanding calls for Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat to make public statements urging an immediate end to the violence, which they are then expected to follow up by taking concrete steps to reduce friction. It may no longer be in Mr. Arafat's power to completely shut down all further Palestinian violence. Militant groups like Hamas have pledged to continue fighting, and new incidents flared yesterday in the hours after the summit meeting concluded. But if Mr. Barak is satisfied over the next day or so that Mr. Arafat is trying as hard as he can to rein in Palestinian fighters under his command, clamp down on Hamas and calm the broader Palestinian community, Israel will withdraw tanks from major Palestinian population centers, unseal its borders with the West Bank and Gaza and reopen the Gaza airport.</p>
        <p>Agreement was also reached on the Palestinian demand for an investigation of the causes of the current upheaval. Mr. Arafat, who had originally insisted on a broadly international inquiry, instead accepted the idea of a committee consisting of Israelis, Palestinians and Americans, formed in consultation with the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan.</p>
        <p>Further, the two sides agreed to explore, over the next two weeks, the possibility of resuming negotiations toward a final peace settlement. The comprehensive peace agreement that seemed in sight only a month ago no longer appears a realistic possibility, at least in the short term. But it would be useful for the two sides to return to the negotiating table, the only place where their remaining differences over Jerusalem, refugees and other issues can ultimately be resolved. It is particularly important for Israelis and Palestinians to resume regular contacts over security matters with an eye to avoiding future destructive outbreaks of violence.</p>
        <p>Unlike most high-level diplomatic meetings, this one was set up without much preparation and with no guarantees of even minimal success. Mr. Clinton, along with Mr. Annan, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan, wisely recognized that tensions between Israelis and Palestinians were spiraling out of control and endangering the entire Middle East. Mr. Barak promptly agreed to attend, and so, eventually, did Mr. Arafat, braving the vocal opposition of many Palestinians. If the Israelis and Palestinians are now able to put into practice the understandings Mr. Clinton announced yesterday morning, it may be possible to start repairing the immense damage inflicted on the peace process by the violence unleashed in recent weeks.</p>
