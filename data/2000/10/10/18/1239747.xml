        <p>Four and a half weeks after he pleaded guilty to one felony count, the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee had his first session today with government officials and began explaining why he had illegally downloaded a library of nuclear secrets, an activity that the government said imperiled national security.</p>
        <p>Neither side would discuss what occurred at the meeting, which took place at the Federal District Court in Albuquerque after some disputes over scheduling. But one lawyer said it had gone smoothly.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee attended with two of his lawyers, John Cline and K. C. Maxwell. Present for the government was George Stamboulidis, the lead prosecutor, along with F.B.I. agents.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee had agreed in his plea that he would submit to 10 debriefing sessions over three weeks, each of them up to six hours long. Though the government had long insisted that it was desperate to learn why Dr. Lee had downloaded the data, and especially what had happened to seven missing computer tapes packed with secrets, officials made little effort to schedule the debriefing until last week, after news organizations noted the apparent lack of urgency.</p>
        <p>But a disagreement arose over the scheduling of the meetings. The mediator who helped work out the plea, Judge Edward Leavy of Federal District Court, had to be consulted again last week.</p>
        <p>Mark Holscher, Dr. Lee's lead criminal lawyer, was married on  Saturday and left for a long-scheduled honeymoon. The government had been informed in advance of his plans, but the prosecutors had asked to set up the debriefings just as Mr. Holscher was scheduled to depart.</p>
        <p>The defense, which said it had been prepared to do the debriefings shortly after the plea was entered, had sought to delay them until Mr. Holscher returned.</p>
        <p>After Judge Leavy was asked to intervene, people involved in the matter said, it was decided that the meetings would go ahead anyway with Mr. Cline, Mr. Holscher's co-counsel, accompanying Dr. Lee.</p>
        <p>In a related matter, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson said today that he had accepted recommendations for tightening security at Los Alamos and other government weapons laboratories.</p>
