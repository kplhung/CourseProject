        <p>Boots P.L.C., a British retailer of health, beauty and food products, said yesterday that it had bought the Clearasil acne treatment brand from Procter &amp; Gamble for $340 million. Global sales of Clearasil, the leading brand of acne treatment products, totaled $137 million in 1999, with 39 percent of its users in the United States. Boots said the purchase would enhance its earnings within a year. Procter &amp; Gamble, which also makes Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent, is shedding what it sees as minor brands in an effort to restore sagging profits.</p>
