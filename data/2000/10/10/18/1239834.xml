        <p>Shortly after the ball left the right hand of Orlando Hernandez, it also left the field of play, launched into the right-field stands by the bat of Carlos Guillen.

        <p>Shortly after the ball left the right hand of Orlando Hernandez, it also left the field of play, launched into the right-field stands by the bat of Carlos Guillen. The two-run homer gave the Seattle Mariners a four-run lead in the fourth inning, and it seemed as if it might give the Yankees pitcher known as El Duque the first postseason defeat of his career.</p>
        <p>As he watched the ball land in the upper deck, Hernandez covered his face with his glove, peeking through it as if to confirm the damage. How many more runs would he give up? How many more batters would he face? Could anybody bear to watch?</p>
        <p>''I covered my face because I made a mistake,'' Hernandez said through a translator. ''I threw it over the plate.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, he faced plenty more batters and more than 56,000 witnesses liked most of what they saw. Hernandez allowed one more run before leaving in the eighth inning and another run was charged to him when a man left on base scored later in the inning.</p>
        <p>Although Hernandez struggled mightily, he was the winning pitcher as the Yankees beat the Mariners, 9-7, to clinch the American League Championship Series in six games and qualify to meet the Mets in the World Series.</p>
        <p>''What's more important above everything is that the Yankees are once again in the World Series,'' Hernandez said in the celebration of the locker room.</p>
        <p>The victory gave Hernandez an 8-0 record in postseason play, including 2-0 in this series and 3-0 in the first two rounds of the playoffs. He is the first player in major league history to win his first eight decisions in the postseason. He will get at least one start, probably two, against the Mets.</p>
        <p>''The fans are going to enjoy a spectacular event, which they deserve,'' Hernandez said of the coming Subway Series. El Duque proved again what Yankees fans have known since he arrived from Cuba three seasons ago, a mystery man with details cloudy about his escape and even his date of birth. Big, bald and bold, he resembled Mark Messier, the hockey star of the Rangers, in some physical and competitive aspects. Like Messier, Hernandez competes. Most good pitchers can win when they have their best stuff. Hernandez showed again last night that he can win when he has to overcome himself and his lack of control as well as the opposing batters.</p>
        <p>Not always a conversational man, his words flowed like the Champagne around him.</p>
        <p>''I really enjoy the pressure,'' said Hernandez, who allowed six runs, seven hits and five walks in seven-plus innings. ''I like to compete under pressure. It was a great battle for our team.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the return to the World Series and playing as a Yankee, Hernandez said: ''It's a dream of mine since I was a kid. It's one of the most important things to happen to me in my life. My first day with the Yankees, I was happy wearing the uniform. From that day forward, I could die happy.''</p>
        <p>''This is a combination of sacrifice over eight months, and it makes us very happy. The Mets have proven they are a great team, especially in the games between us and them.''</p>
