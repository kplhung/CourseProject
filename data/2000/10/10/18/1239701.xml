        <p>DOUGHNUT makers are a furtive bunch.</p>
        <p>''Everyone should just find a recipe and have fun with it, create their own,'' said Mark Isreal, the owner of the Doughnut Plant on the Lower East Side, as he ducked question after question about ingredients, time, type of frying oil.</p>
        <p>''Time, temperature and humidity,'' he finally said, ''that's the key.'' But he would give no specifics on time, temperature or humidity.</p>
        <p>So I called James Bryant, who made legendary doughnuts at Georgie's Pastry Shop in Harlem until it closed in 1998.</p>
        <p>''If I had something going,'' Mr. Bryant said, ''why should I give it away?''</p>
        <p>Then, after 30 minutes on the phone with Maury Rubin, the owner of City Bakery, I thought I was finally getting somewhere. ''There are three big things with making doughnuts that I found in my own research with doughnuts,'' he said. ''And I haven't told you any of them.''</p>
        <p>Then he chuckled.</p>
        <p>Hilarious!</p>
        <p>But I was undeterred: one way or another, I was going to learn how to make a good doughnut. The doughnut is one pastry that Americans can truly call their own, and lately it has come to a sorry, sodden state. Even in New York, where serious bakers and pastry chefs have taken up the task, the exceptions are few. Eli Zabar makes a fine classic yeast-raised doughnut and a jelly doughnut that is light, springy and chewy. Good, a Greenwich Village restaurant, fries fragrant sour cream orange doughnuts to order. And a few old diners and bakeshops still make good ones, like S.G.S. Donuts in Chelsea and Steinway Bake Shop in Astoria, Queens. Beyond these, the situation is mostly depressing.</p>
        <p>It is easy to criticize doughnuts. There are the greasy, fluffy ones. The heavy caky. The chewy yeasty. The dry dunkers. They are highly variable, delicate, sensitive to bad handling and to climate conditions. And because eating one is an act of naughtiness, they tend to inspire passion, irrational exuberance and, at times, guilt-driven disdain.</p>
        <p>Doughnut eaters tend to divide into those who like yeast doughnuts, the light squishy kind, often glazed, and those who prefer cake doughnuts, which are leavened with baking soda and baking powder and are more dense and dry. Cake doughnut eaters tend to be dunkers, and in my opinion,  mistaken on the doughnut's true pleasures.</p>
        <p>I am a yeast doughnut eater. I want my doughnut to have some meatiness, and not just density, to it. It should be crisp on the outside, textured with nooks and crannies, and chewy on the inside. The dough should be moist, airy and taste of yeast and real eggs; it should not be too sweet.</p>
        <p>That's what I was after when I decided to make them. What I didn't expect to discover was a reserve of respect for all the bad doughnuts I had once sniffed at. It is not an easy project: the best doughnuts involve a wet, sticky dough, obscene amounts of butter, sugar and fat, and microscopic bits of it all clinging to the walls of your kitchen.</p>
        <p>Since doughnut makers proved a fruitless source, I began with cookbooks. The original ''Joy of Cooking'' gave a few recipes, each with about three lines of instruction, to the effect of ''Mix, shape and fry until brown.'' Mr. Isreal could have written the text.</p>
        <p>Modern cookbooks were more explicit. In ''The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook,'' Christopher Kimball includes a terrific recipe for buttermilk cake doughnuts. The dough has a consistency, as he describes it, somewhere between that of a batter and that of a cookie dough. Like most cake doughnut doughs, it's dense and sticky, enriched with buttermilk, butter, whole eggs and egg yolks, and so is tricky to handle. You need to work quickly but gently, much as you would with biscuits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimball even gives precise counts -- down to the second -- for mixing and frying. The recipe is flawless and turns out a moist, fragrant cake doughnut.</p>
        <p>It's also surprisingly light. Its only problem is that it's a cake doughnut.</p>
        <p>Yeast doughnuts, as it turns out, are easier to make. And because they can rise slowly in the refrigerator, they are easier to do at your own pace. The dough is much like brioche, but you fry the dough rather than bake it.</p>
        <p>And you can make yeast doughnuts that are better than any you will find in a bakery. The yeast doughnuts from ''Nancy Silverton's Pastries From the La Brea Bakery'' were the best I have ever eaten: plump little wheels that tasted of eggs, vanilla and browned butter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Silverton's recipe was a perfect model for understanding yeast doughnuts. The dough strikes a balance between weight and richness. It is moist and loose enough to form a dough that swells and expands in the hot fat and is highly seasoned and flavored so that it doesn't fade from your palate.</p>
        <p>Ms. Silverton uses pastry flour rather than all-purpose flour and flavors the dough with kosher salt, vanilla and sugar. She lets the dough rise slowly, as with bread, to allow the flavor to develop.</p>
        <p>I did change her recipe a little. Ms. Silverton fries doughnuts in canola oil, but as another baker slipped to me, liquid fats produce a greasy doughnut (especially when you fry them at home with less control over the temperature and, thus, the absorption). I used vegetable shortening instead, which firms up after the doughnut is fried, and I fried the doughnuts in small batches at a slightly lower temperature (365 degrees as opposed to 375), making sure to keep the temperature as even as possible.</p>
        <p>Ms. Silverton coats the doughnuts with a powdered sugar glaze. I rolled some in a mixture of cinnamon, sugar and salt and others in honey.</p>
        <p>They were beauties. And they stayed that way for about two hours. By morning, they were like any other doughnut: no matter how good they start out, doughnuts die once they are cold.</p>
        <p>Although I now had respect for anyone turning them out by the dozen, Mr. Rubin's three points were still a mystery to me.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons he conceded for being so proprietary (aside from the nature of bakers) was that there is a fine line between a great doughnut and one that's average.</p>
        <p>I could see that when making them. But that great doughnut is unforgettable, as Mr. Rubin will also attest. ''One of the hands-down favorite meals of my life was this humongous affair of a doughnut,'' he said. ''It was like a honey-glazed doughnut. I ate it in my car in the back parking lot of a place in Maine. It was eight inches across and like four inches high. It was somewhere between warm and hot, and the thing was literally melting in my mouth. On my deathbed I will think back on that doughnut.''</p>
        <p>The origin of the doughnut is unclear. It is possible, David A. Taylor wrote in a 1998 article in Smithsonian magazine, that it descended from a Dutch pastry called olykoeks, or ''oily cakes.'' The name doughnuts, he wrote, came later, from Elizabeth Gregory, a New England home cook in the mid-19th century, who made fried dough filled with nuts (dough-nuts) and lemon rind for her son, who later took credit for the hole.</p>
        <p>Doughnuts were made for soldiers in World War I, and by 1920, the first doughnut machine was invented in New York. When it became possible to produce the pastry quickly and efficiently, Mr. Taylor wrote, they soon became a symbol of national progress. The Krispy Kreme doughnut was born in 1937.</p>
        <p>By the 1950's, many small bakeries began buying mixes for their doughnuts. Mixes contain stabilizers, preservatives and other unsavory things. But they are cheaper, and consumers somehow didn't seem to notice the difference. Mediocre commercial doughnuts became the standard.</p>
        <p>Then, a few years ago, Krispy Kremes actually became trendy. In 1997, Nora Ephron waxed poetic about them in The New Yorker. She saw them as some kind of miracle. ''The Krispy Kreme Original Glazed doughnut is yeast-raised and light as a frosted snowflake,'' she wrote. ''It is possible to eat three of them in one sitting without suffering any ill effects.''</p>
        <p>It is easy to see how Ms. Ephron and so many others have been seduced by them. When Krispy Kreme swept into town, it had the backing of proud Southerners and it brought a show with it. The shop on 23rd Street, for instance, is bright and clean. The doughnuts, all lined up in neat rows, glisten in the glass cases. In the back you can watch the doughnut machine cranking away.</p>
        <p>As they come out, the doughnuts roll down a curved steel slide. On a recent visit I got one of the glazed originals, hot off the press. It looked just like a stroller wheel, coated in white wax. I pinched off a piece, and it felt as if I was pinching a spider web. It melted like cotton candy and left a slick of sweet sticky grease in my mouth. About five seconds later, it was stale.</p>
        <p>Doughnuts are a crude pleasure. And commercial doughnuts lack all of the best, crudest parts of it: the contrast in textures, the flavorful grease, the eggy taste.</p>
        <p>And for that alone, they are worth a brief meltdown of your kitchen.</p>
        <p>RAISED DOUGHNUTS  Adapted from ''Nancy Silverton's Pastries From the La Brea Bakery'' (Villard, $35)  Time: 2 hours plus 2 1/2 hours' rising time</p>
        <p>3/4 cup whole milk  2 teaspoons packed fresh yeast or 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast  3 cups plus 2 tablespoons unbleached pastry flour, or 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour and 1 cup cake flour (not self rising)  6 extra-large egg yolks</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt  1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter  1 vanilla bean  1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract  6 cups vegetable shortening.</p>
        <p>1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat milk until warm to the touch. Transfer to the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook, and add yeast. Let yeast soften 1 to 2 minutes, then stir to combine. Add 2 3/4 cups flour, without stirring. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until surface of flour cracks, 30 to 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together  egg yolks, sugar and salt. Whisk in  1/4 cup flour, and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Split vanilla bean lengthwise, and scrape out pulp and seeds into butter. Swirl pan as butter heats, and cook 3 to 5 minutes, until bubbles subside and liquid is dark brown. Remove vanilla bean.</p>
        <p>4. Whisk butter into egg mixture. Stir in vanilla. Add to yeast mixture. Return to mixer, and mix on low for 1 minute. Add remaining 2 tablespoons flour, and mix to combine. Turn mixer up to medium-high for 1 more minute. Dough should be very sticky.</p>
        <p>5. Sift a light coating of flour onto a work surface. Scrape dough onto it, and gather into a ball. Clean mixing bowl, and lightly coat with oil. Add dough, cover and allow to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until doubled.</p>
        <p>6. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface, tuck edges to deflate and return to oiled bowl. Cover and allow dough to rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>7. In a deep, heavy pan, heat shortening to 365 degrees. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface, and gently pat into a rectangle about  1/2 inch thick, flouring surface of dough as necessary. Dip a 2 1/2-inch doughnut cutter in flour, and cutting as close together as possible, cut out doughnuts. Let doughnuts and holes rest 15 minutes. Gather  scraps of dough together, gently roll or pat to  1/2-inch thickness and cut out remaining doughnuts.</p>
        <p>8. Add doughnuts to pan, a few at a time. When they rise to surface, turn them over. Adjust heat to keep oil at 365 degrees. Fry until browned, about 30 to 50 seconds, then flip once more and brown other side. Drain on paper towels. Fry remaining doughnuts. Fry holes separately; they will take less time. Cool, then sift powdered sugar over doughnuts. Or, dip them in one of the following coatings.</p>
        <p>Yield: 18 doughnuts and holes.</p>
        <p>Topping variations:</p>
        <p>Honey glaze: In a pan, heat  3/4 cup of honey until it is warm to the touch, and then dip the warm doughnuts in to coat.</p>
        <p>Cinnamon sugar: Combine  1/2 cup sugar with 1 teaspoon sea salt and 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon, and dip the warm doughnuts in to coat.</p>
        <p>White glaze: Combine  1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sifted powdered sugar in the top of a double boiler over simmering water with  1/4 cup heavy cream,  1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and  1/8 teaspoon Kosher salt. Heat until just warm, stirring frequently, until thin and translucent. Use a pastry brush to coat doughnuts.</p>
        <p>BUTTERMILK DOUGHNUTS  Adapted from ''The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook'' by Christopher Kimball  (Little, Brown, 1998)  Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  1 cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda  2 teaspoons baking powder  1 teaspoon salt  1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground nutmeg</p>
        <p>3/4 cup buttermilk  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  2 eggs  1 egg yolk  6 cups vegetable shortening  6 ounces lard (optional).</p>
        <p>1. In bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle, combine 1 cup flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt and nutmeg. In another bowl, whisk together buttermilk, melted butter, whole eggs and yolk. With mixer on medium speed, pour liquid into dry ingredients and beat for 10 seconds to make a homogenous batter.</p>
        <p>2. Lower speed and add remaining 2 cups flour; mix until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, give dough a thorough mix, in case liquid on bottom of mixing bowl has not been thoroughly combined. Dough will be quite moist and tacky, somewhere between a thick cake batter and a cookie dough.</p>
        <p>3. In a cast-iron Dutch oven or deep, heavy pan, heat shortening and lard to 375 degrees. Meanwhile, dust a work surface and a rolling pin with flour. Roll out dough to  1/2-inch thickness. Dip a 2 1/2-inch doughnut cutter in flour and cut out doughnuts. Gather scraps, roll them out and cut out more doughnuts. Let sit for 5 minutes before frying.</p>
        <p>4. Add doughnuts to oil, 4 or 5 at a time. As doughnuts rise to top, flip them using a slotted spoon. Let cook for 50 seconds, until well browned, and flip again. Fry for same amount of time on other side. Drain on paper towels. Let oil return to 375 degrees before frying subsequent batches. Eat warm, as is, or let cool and dust with powdered sugar.</p>
        <p>Yield: about 16 doughnuts.</p>
