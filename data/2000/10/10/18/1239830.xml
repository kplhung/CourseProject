        <p>Accor of France said it had abandoned talks to buy Granada Compass's hotel business because it was unable to agree on a price. Granada Compass, meanwhile, has decided to hold an auction for its Forte hotel division, which includes the Posthouse, Heritage and Signature chains. Accor said it would not participate in an auction, but potential bidders for the division, which could fetch around $5.8 billion, include Marriott International and the Hilton Group, analysts said.</p>
