        <p>Brandon Slay is growing accustomed to the prospect of replacing the silver medal he won in freestyle wrestling at the Sydney Olympics with a gold one. But he is not yet ready to celebrate.</p>
        <p>The International Olympic Committee's executive board has yet to rule on a recommendation made by its medical commission on Monday that the gold medal be stripped from Alexander Leipold of Germany because he tested positive for the steroid nandrolone last month at the Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>''I haven't let it move me emotionally yet,'' Slay said yesterday during a conference call from Amarillo, Tex. ''There's a 1 percent chance that it won't happen. If I'm blessed with the opportunity of having a gold medal, I'd be so pleased to accept it. If this works out, I'll be blessed with the thrill of victory. Not many athletes can say they have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat in about two weeks.''</p>
        <p>USA Wrestling officials said the I.O.C. executive board was expected to meet within a few days. Even if the panel upholds the commission's finding, Leipold could still appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. His urine sample was found to contain 10 times the acceptable limit of nandrolone.</p>
        <p>Slay reacted bitterly to losing by 4-0 to Leipold in the 167.5-pound class, charging that the referee had unfairly penalized him for 3 points, taking him out of his offensive strategy. Slay refused to let the referee raise his hand after the match and later apologized for seeming rude.</p>
        <p>''I immediately felt like a failure,'' he said. ''I felt angry, I felt empty and I felt lost, but once I prayed about it, I realized I was blessed to have won silver.'' He said he would not blame his rival for tainting his Olympic experience.</p>
        <p>''It didn't happen the way I dreamed, but he didn't take it away from me,'' Slay said. ''Who knows why things happen? It wasn't in Alexander Leipold's control.''</p>
        <p>If the I.O.C. awards Slay with the gold medal, it would be the only one for the United States freestyle team at Sydney. Rulon Gardner won gold for the Greco-Roman team in the superheavyweight division, defeating the Russian Aleksandr Karelin.</p>
        <p>Jim Scherr, the executive director of USA Wrestling, said, ''We're optimistic the executive board will uphold the recommendation of the medical commission.''</p>
