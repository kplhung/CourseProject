        <p>AT the heart of every chocolate truffle is ganache, a velvety amalgam of chocolate and cream that is often enhanced with flavorings as luxurious as Champagne and as exotic as black tea.

He starts with fine bittersweet chocolate of a type called couverture, which is sold at specialty food shops. Ordinary baking chocolate will not do. He prefers Valrhona chocolate with 65 to 67 percent chocolate solids. A higher percentage than that, he said, has too much cocoa butter and will make the ganache too heavy. Using couverture also eliminates the need for butter.</p>

        <p>AT the heart of every chocolate truffle is ganache, a velvety amalgam of chocolate and cream that is often enhanced with flavorings as luxurious as Champagne and as exotic as black tea. But ganache is not just for candy makers. Spooned into a pastry shell it makes a glossy chocolate tartlet. It can be sandwiched between cake layers or spooned warm over ice cream for hot fudge gone to heaven. Add egg yolks, then whipped egg whites and perhaps whipped cream folded in, and you have chocolate mousse.</p>
        <p>Ganache couldn't be simpler to prepare, but it takes an expert like Robert Linxe, the owner of La Maison du Chocolat, a chain of chocolate shops based in Paris, to show how it's best made. The exacting Mr. Linxe, who founded the chain in 1978, demonstrated his ganache-making skills last week at his new store in Rockefeller Center. He starts with fine bittersweet chocolate of a type called couverture, which is sold at specialty food shops. Ordinary baking chocolate will not do. He prefers Valrhona chocolate with 65 to 67 percent chocolate solids. A higher percentage than that, he said, has too much cocoa butter and will make the ganache too heavy. Using couverture also eliminates the need for butter.</p>
        <p>''People add butter and even sugar to ganache to compensate for inferior chocolate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He has tips for every step. Use a serrated knife to chop the chocolate in half-inch pieces, so they don't fly off the cutting board. The proportions are about twice as much chocolate, by weight, as cream. He brings the heavy cream (the supermarket type, even ultrapasteurized, is fine) to a boil, then takes it off the heat. He then repeats this step, which reduces the acidity in the cream, twice more.</p>
        <p>After the last boil he waits 20 seconds, then pours the cream over the chocolate in a bowl. Using a wooden spoon, he gently mashes the chocolate in the hot cream, and when most of it has softened, he begins whisking, starting in the center of the bowl and gradually working around to the outside, until the mixture is smooth and exceptionally glossy. That's it.</p>
        <p>Once the ganache has cooled to room temperature, it thickens and can be piped through a pastry tube or dropped from a small spoon to make little truffles, which can be chilled until they harden, about an hour, then dusted with cocoa to serve. Use only dark Dutch-process cocoa. At La Maison du Chocolat, the truffles are coated with a thin shell of bittersweet chocolate before being dipped in cocoa. The truffles are not perfectly round because ''they look more like truffles from the earth that way,'' Mr. Linxe said. Because ganache is so rich and chocolaty, small single-bite truffles are much more pleasing than gigantic ones.</p>
        <p>Plain ganache can also be flavored by infusing the cream with vanilla, ginger or other spices or even herbs like fresh mint, by adding grated citrus zest to the chopped chocolate, or by whisking in spirits or liqueur at the end. With hazelnut paste, ganache becomes gianduja, a classic Italian confection. Mr. Linxe said prepared ganache keeps up to two weeks, covered, in the refrigerator. Warm it by putting the bowl of ganache in a pan of simmering water.</p>
        <p>BASIC GANACHE  Time: 30 minutes plus cooling</p>
        <p>1 pound bittersweet couverture chocolate, like Valrhona  1 cup heavy cream.</p>
        <p>1. Chop chocolate with large serrated knife, and place in a 3-quart bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Place cream in saucepan, bring to boil and remove from heat. Bring to boil and remove from heat twice more. Wait 20 seconds, then pour cream over chocolate. Use a wooden spoon to mash the chocolate until it is soft. Whisk to combine, starting in center of bowl and gradually working out. Stop whisking as soon as mixture is blended. Ganache can keep in the refrigerator up to two weeks.</p>
        <p>Yield: Enough for about 75 small truffles.</p>
