        <p>Thousands of words tumbled out of the candidates mouths' tonight -- small ones and big ones, fancy references and colloquial terms -- but there was something else that spoke much more loudly and eloquently.</p>
        <p>It was body language, and one of its messages was unmistakable: Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore do not like each other one bit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore never actually verbalized this. But he strayed from his stool on the red-carpeted stage at one point and literally claimed Mr. Bush's territory as his own, shooting daggers at the Texas governor as Mr. Bush implied that the vice president was too partisan a politician to get anything done.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush never verbalized it, either. But one look at the tightness of his smile and the exasperated shrug of his shoulders whenever he believed that Mr. Gore was going overboard made his view of the vice president clearer than even the spiciest adjective could.</p>
        <p>The third and last presidential debate unshackled the candidates from a lectern or a table and let them roam, and what happened was in some ways extraordinary. Their answers and arguments did not change, but the whole feeling of the encounter did.</p>
        <p>It seemed more bracing, more candid, more revealing. And that was because the candidates' gestures, facial tics and movements communicated so much about them, from their apparent feelings toward each other to the depths of their longing for the presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's ardor seemed bottomless. He strode this way and that, arms outstretched, head tilted forward, eyes ablaze.</p>
        <p>He also found a vocabulary to match his demeanor in a pugilist's promise, repeated time and again.</p>
        <p>''I want to fight for you,'' he told a small audience of voters here and a larger audience of television viewers nationwide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's desire seemed muted, sometimes curiously so, as he kept his hands closer to himself, covered less physical ground and let his features go slack, as if he were musing out loud rather than making a vigorous case.</p>
        <p>It was as obvious tonight as at any previous point during the campaign that Mr. Bush was betting heavily that voters, in a time of prosperity, preferred a folksy, sometimes shuffling politician to one with any strains of stridency.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Bush spoke so softly at times that he seemed to be on the verge of slumber, and his answer to Mr. Gore's laser-beam stare was a wizened mien of bemusement.</p>
        <p>He also sought to direct voters' attention to what he clearly saw as an empty theatricality in the vice president by suggesting that Mr. Gore was too busy performing to provide the required, relevant responses.</p>
        <p>''One reason people are skeptical,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to American's relationship to their government, ''is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.''</p>
        <p>What voters perhaps saw tonight, more vividly than in the first or second debate, were the divergent degrees of intensity that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush bring to the presidential contest. What voters were left to decide is which style will give them the kind of government they want.</p>
        <p>Of course, some of the difference between the candidates had to be chalked up to the disparate burdens they carried into tonight's encounter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's was heavier, the result of a slight disadvantage in several of the most recent polls and withering criticisms of his previous two debate performances -- overcooked the first time around and underdone the second.</p>
        <p>Tonight he came closer than he ever had to finding that medium temperature, though a seemingly innate boastfulness was evident once again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore managed to mention that all four of his children had come, of their own volition, to the debate tonight. He managed to recite the entirety of his foreign-policy resume.</p>
        <p>And he managed to recall his service in Vietnam, even doing so in a way that endeavored to provide him inoculation from any charge that he was stretching the truth or being a braggart.</p>
        <p>''I didn't do the most or run the gravest risk by a long shot,'' Mr. Gore said, ''but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seemed intent above all on not committing any errors, which meant staying relaxed, and he probably made a special effort in that direction, given what happened to his father eight years ago. Unnerved by precisely the kind of town-hall format that was used tonight, former President Bush stole glances at his wrist watch, to disastrous effect.</p>
        <p>But his son may have gotten too mellow, his easygoing comportment sometimes producing hazy or disjointed locutions.</p>
        <p>''One thing about insurance that's a Washington term,'' Mr. Bush said at one point, despite the fact that there is really no other word for it, and his proposals for people on Medicare involve precisely that.</p>
        <p>Talking to a teacher in the audience about the way in which federal regulations sometimes hamper local schools, Mr. Bush said, ''I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-out-er.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore unfurled statistic upon statistic, putting his knowledge on full and self-conscious display. Mr. Bush leaned harder on generalities, answering a question about how parents could be made to take greater responsibility for their children's education by saying that he wished he could write and pass a law that would make people love each other.</p>
        <p>He sometimes sounded like a greeting card. Mr. Gore occasionally sounded like the denizen of a think tank.</p>
        <p>And that was the choice with which voters were presented in this last, arguably best and easily most demonstrative presidential debate: one guy so loose-limbed and laid-back that he seemed capable of slipping off his stool; another guy so coiled and intent he was barely able to sit still on his.</p>
