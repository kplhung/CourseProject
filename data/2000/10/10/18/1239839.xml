        <p>As Tino Martinez's glove snapped shut on the final out, the stars clicked into alignment in the sporting firmament above New York and a constellation that had not been seen in 44 years lighted up the skies of a city deliciously and deliriously divided against itself.</p>
        <p>The Yankees and the Mets. Timeless pinstripes vs. suddenly fashionable blue and orange. A Subway Series.</p>
        <p>It had to happen sooner or later. With 16 teams in the National League and 14 in the American, random chance would pair the Mets and the Yankees in the World Series once every 224 years. And given that the Yankees win pennants with stultifying regularity, it was probably due to happen sooner.</p>
        <p>But that did not make the Yankees' 9-7 victory over the Mariners any less sweet. And as the city absorbed the news, the moods in the streets, living rooms and taverns of the city ranged from pandemonium to a quiet sense of awe at witnessing a moment in history.</p>
        <p>At McHale's bar on Eighth Avenue near Times Square, the dozens of Yankee fanatics crowding the television stood slackjawed as the scenes of cheering fans filled the screen.</p>
        <p>''We're just crying,'' said Cristina Nascimento, 23, a law student from Weehawken, N.J. ''We can't believe it.''</p>
        <p>Dean Sirigos, 40, an information technology manager from the Midwood section of Brooklyn, added: ''Whatever the result is, a lot of Yankees fans will be crying. But right now, at the beginning, it's just a celebration of New York.''</p>
        <p>While Sirigos actually seemed to be contemplating the possibility that the Yankees might not win the Series, at the more rambunctious Bull Moose Saloon around the corner, Tom Brown, 38, harbored no such doubts.</p>
        <p>''Yankees fans aren't afraid at all,'' said Brown, who lives nearby in Hell's Kitchen and has been a Yankee fan ''since I knew what pinstripes were.''</p>
        <p>''We're looking forward to it,'' he said. ''We want to spank the Mets.''</p>
        <p>Outside Yankee Stadium, the crowd poured out shouting and screaming.</p>
        <p>''I dreamed of this my whole life,'' said Jack Berkowitz, an accountant. ''I never thought it would happen.''</p>
        <p>Now, with four days to count down until Saturday's opening game at Yankee Stadium, partisans of both teams have time to ponder the stakes. A rivalry that has been intense but completely theoretical -- barring a few relatively meaningless interleague games -- will be put to the test. It's put up or shut up time. The day of reckoning.</p>
        <p>And it's not just about the Yankee-Met dialectic either, for the Mets carry upon their shoulders not just the hopes of their own supporters but those of legions of Brooklyn Dodger fans still smarting from their team's seventh-game loss at the hands of the Bronx Bombers in 1956 and the Dodgers' ignominious decampment for the West Coast a year later.</p>
        <p>Jim Varley, a stock trader and Mets fan from Huntington on Long Island, who was escorted through Yankee Stadium by a group of Yankee-loving colleagues from work, predicted a chance of mayhem.</p>
        <p>''As someone said in the bathroom, I think they're going to have to get two separate bathrooms -- one for the Mets'' -- meaning their fans -- ''and one for the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>But before the Yankees demolished the Mariners, Met fans enjoyed 24 hours or so of uninterrupted boasting and strutting, and they made the most of it.</p>
        <p>At the Manhattan radio station where David Shaw, 24, works in sales, most of his colleagues are Yankee fans. He roots for the Mets and always has. He has listened to Yankee bragging for an eternity. After all, he was 10 the last time the Mets got to play in a World Series, and it became obvious that the wisest course for a Mets fan to follow in October was to be inconspicuous. Not yesterday.</p>
        <p>''Every day, we come in and we argue,'' he said. But yesterday, it was his day to gloat. He couldn't resist needling his co-workers: ''Hey, what's taking you so long? We're in!''</p>
        <p>He knew destiny was with the Mets. ''This is our year,'' he said. ''We're going to take it. We've paid our dues. It's our time.''</p>
        <p>It was the best day of the year -- make that of 14 years -- to display Mets loyalty rather than to conceal it. Everywhere there were New Yorkers in Mets caps and Mets jackets and Mets shirts. If you were a Mets fan without Mets clothing, you bought some.</p>
        <p>Audra Fallacara, 31, an administrative assistant, stopped in at the Mets Clubhouse Shop on East 54th Street to pick up a Mets T-shirt to advertise the team's success. For her? For her husband?</p>
        <p>No, for the dog.</p>
        <p>She selected a No. 31 Mike Piazza shirt in a child's small. ''The dog's a Piazza fan,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Throughout a city of divided baseball loyalties, offices and households riven by opposing team allegiances moved that much closer to their battle stations. Mets fans yesterday already shifted to full alert status.</p>
        <p>Take Maggie and Bobby Gaglin. She works for a bank and is a big Yankee fan. He's an electrician and an immutable Mets fan. They live in Richmond Hill, Queens, giving Bobby a geographic edge.</p>
        <p>As it happens, she's a Yankee fan of notable generosity in that not only is she genuinely glad that the Mets are in the Series, but given their years of futility, she allowed that: ''I wouldn't cry if the Mets won. I can't imagine waiting that long for your team to get in.''</p>
        <p>Her husband can. He was up until who-knows-what hour Monday night, the chatter from the TV canceling her sleep, as he deliriously celebrated with their dog, Mookie, named for Mookie Wilson, he of the 1986 should-have-been-an-out World Series ground ball to first. Her husband was up so late he never got to work.</p>
        <p>On their roof, they had positioned a simulation of a corpse for Halloween purposes and she knew that Bobby was threatening to put a Yankee shirt on the deceased. ''He does that,'' she said, ''and I'm going to put a Mets shirt on it.''</p>
        <p>How will they watch the World Series?</p>
        <p>''In different rooms,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mets fans took the day to compare among themselves their own stories of suffering and resilience. Hector Medina, 23, a corrections officer, became a Mets fan at what seemed like the best possible time: 1986. They won it all, unforgettably. To his young mind, the Mets had to be the greatest team to root for. Little did he suspect that was going to be it.</p>
        <p>''It's been heartbreaking,'' he said. ''Heartbreaking. I've just been sad. They just couldn't get in. Year after year, they couldn't get in. It was so hard.''</p>
        <p>And then there was Lamont Iglesias, 26, a mail clerk, who began his voyage as a Mets fan one year later, in 1987. It seemed to him he had picked the worst possible team.</p>
        <p>It didn't help any that he lived in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''For many years I've been getting pounced for being a Mets fan and living in the Bronx,'' he said. Yesterday he was still in a state of disbelief. ''I'm not used to it,'' he said. ''I could get used to it.''</p>
