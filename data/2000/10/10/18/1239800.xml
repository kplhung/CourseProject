        <p>A communications chip maker, the Marvell Technology Group, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Galileo Technology Ltd., an Israel-based maker of network routing and switching equipment, for about $2.7 billion in stock. Investors apparently thought Marvell had overpaid, and they knocked its stock down 30 percent from $57.06, to $24.69, and thereby cut the value of the deal to about $1.85 billion. Marvell is betting that its acquisition of Galileo will make it more competitive by allowing it to offer a full suite of products.</p>
