        <p>West 10th's New Mood</p>
        <p>Indigo, 142 West 10th Street, has become Merge, an eclectic spot owned by Gino Diaferia, who also owns Veritas in the Flatiron district, and Sam DeMarco, who owns First in the East Village. Mr. DeMarco will also be the chef at District, which he is opening next month with Mr. Diaferia in the Muse, a new hotel in the theater district.</p>

        <p>Out of the Bronx</p>
        <p>Jimmy Rodriguez, the owner of Jimmy's Bronx Cafe, near Yankee Stadium, has opened Jimmy's Uptown, 2207 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard (130th Street). This gracious 120-seat place with an upstairs lounge has a menu that blends French cooking with Latin and soul in dishes like pork chops with mushroom ragout and corn arepas, and Maine lobster with fufu (mashed green plantains), greens and lobster butter. The chef, Denzil Richards, a Jamaican by birth, worked at Le Bernardin, Asia de Cuba and Surya. Mr. Rodriguez has also taken over the space at 400 East 57th Street that had been Deniz, and plans to open Jimmy's Downtown there.</p>
        <p>Mussels Eight Ways</p>
        <p>Chazal, with a broad swath of sidewalk terrace and a French menu, has opened at 41 Madison Avenue (26th Street). It's a joint venture between Alain Chevreux, the owner of Ferrier on the Upper East Side; Roberto Ruggeri of the Bice group; and Jeffrey Beers, the architect who designed the restaurant. The menu features eight preparations each of mussels and carpaccio ($7 to $14).</p>
        <p>Short Orders</p>
        <p>Gitana, a cozy wood-paneled tapas bar, has replaced Diane's Uptown at 249 Columbus Avenue (72nd Street).</p>
        <p>Chez Goo Goo sounds like a place that welcomes baby strollers, but it's a serious spot, at 138 North Eighth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It has a supper club atmosphere and an American menu prepared by Anthony Bonner, who was chef de cuisine at Arcadia, an Anne Rosenzweig restaurant that closed in 1998.</p>
        <p>Gerard Renny, who owns Brasseriebit in Times Square, plans to open Sushi a Go-Go at 1900 Broadway (63rd Street) near Lincoln Center, at the end of the month.</p>
        <p>Chefs on the Move</p>
        <p>Robert Weiner, the new chef at Thalia, at 50th Street and Eighth Avenue, has simplified the menu, with fewer garnishes and Asian touches. He's also banking on the restaurant's staying power. ''My previous jobs were at a bunch of great restaurants that went out of business,'' he said. The list includes Maurice, Aurora, Raphael and Les Celebrites.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 21, 2000, Saturday  A report in the Off the Menu column of the Dining section on Wednesday about Jimmy's Uptown, at 2207 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard (130th Street), was published in error. The restaurant is not scheduled to open until Nov. 13.</p>
