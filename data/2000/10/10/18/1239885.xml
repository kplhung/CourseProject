        <p>SNITOW-Virginia Levitt. On October 16, 2000. Beloved wife of the late Charles. Mother of Ann and Alan. Grandmother of Tania. Services Wednesday, 9:30AM at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. SNITOW-Virginia. The Officers and membership of the American Jewish Congress express their sorrow over the passing of Virginia Snitow, Honorary President of the Women's Division. In her many years of service to our organization, Virginia served in a variety of high level positions, including President of the Women's Division, National Vice President of AJCongress, and Co-Chair of the Governing Council. In her service to the Women's Division, Virginia provided the inspirational leadership that made the Division one of the most powerful voices on behalf of Jewish women in the United States and Israel. Virginia's elegance and gentleness did not diminish her passion for social justice nor her fierce resolve and determination to pursue remedies for inequity and discrimination wherever she encountered them. We extend our condolences to Virginia's daughter Ann, her son Alan, and her entire family. Jack Rosen, President Phil Baum, Executive Director Belle B. Faber, Assoc. Exec. Dir. Lois Waldman, Dir., Comm. for Women's Equality SNITOW-Virginia. Inspiring leader in America's progressive movements for peace, civil rights, labor, education and women's equality. She leaves a legacy as the creative founder of US/Israel Women To Women, which has helped improve the status in quality of life for Israeli women, both Jew and Arab.
