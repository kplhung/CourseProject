        <p>Jason Doig is only 23 years old. But the Rangers have already decided that they have seen enough.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Rangers put Doig on waivers hoping that they can sneak the defenseman through that process and assign him to Hartford, their minor league affiliate in the American Hockey League.</p>
        <p>ter Doig was a major disappointment in his second game of the season.</p>
        <p>Doig looked so nervous every time he touched the puck in the Rangers' 4-3 loss to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks that the Rangers decided they simply could not keep him around anymore -- even if it meant losing him to another team.</p>
        <p>''The problem we have right now is there's no other way of getting him to the minors,'' Coach Ron Low said.</p>
