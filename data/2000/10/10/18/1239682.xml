        <p>Nobody turns a stage into a cozy front porch better than Victoria Williams. So it seemed perfectly natural when Ms. Williams's dog, Rupy, ambled onstage at Joe's Pub (425 Lafayette Street, East Village). The big golden-red mutt curled up under the pedal-steel guitar during Ms. Williams's set and an opening set by her husband, Mark Olson. It was just another touch of the casualness Ms. Williams carries with her like a charmed circle.</p>
        <p>She took her time deciding which songs to play Thursday night; she shrugged and stopped two of them when equipment malfunctioned. She has a high, cracked voice that can make her sound like Neil Young or a precocious 4-year-old, and when she sings she sometimes flaps her arms or makes faces. Meanwhile, her leisurely phrasing mixes her own wayward impulses with touches of Billie Holiday, Mildred Bailey and Louis Armstrong.</p>

        <p>Nobody turns a stage into a cozy front porch better than Victoria Williams. So it seemed perfectly natural when Ms. Williams's dog, Rupy, ambled onstage at Joe's Pub (425 Lafayette Street, East Village). The big golden-red mutt curled up under the pedal-steel guitar during Ms. Williams's set and an opening set by her husband, Mark Olson. It was just another touch of the casualness Ms. Williams carries with her like a charmed circle.</p>
        <p>She took her time deciding which songs to play Thursday night; she shrugged and stopped two of them when equipment malfunctioned. She has a high, cracked voice that can make her sound like Neil Young or a precocious 4-year-old, and when she sings she sometimes flaps her arms or makes faces. Meanwhile, her leisurely phrasing mixes her own wayward impulses with touches of Billie Holiday, Mildred Bailey and Louis Armstrong.</p>
        <p>Yet she is by no means naive. Her songs encompass country, Tin Pan Alley, hymns, blues, 1970's wah-wah funk, even touches of mambo and Indian music, and she sang Kurt Weill, Antonio Carlos Jobim and songs by Charlie Chaplin along with her own. The band members came and went, shifting instruments with Ms. Williams's whims, but each arrangement was precise, with shimmering sustained passages and jaunty, rolling vamps.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams sang about finding epiphanies in ordinary things: the way moonlight falls on a landscape or a bird looks for crumbs after a party. She sang about fond memories, second chances and abiding love. In her songs, those pleasures, momentary and lasting, become comfort for the fact of mortality.</p>
        <p>She started her set singing, ''I don't know how long I got, and neither do you,'' from ''Lagniappe,'' a song on her new album, ''Water to Drink'' (Atlantic). Ms. Williams has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and she and her fans can hear poignancy when she sings her own ''Century Tree,'' about people who bloom late in life, or Weill's ''September Song.'' But Ms. Williams is too blithely gawky to turn maudlin. Her songs are suffused with a clearheaded optimism; they are benedictions of the everyday.</p>
        <p>The couple shared a band, the Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers, with whom they make music in their home in the desert country of Joshua Tree, Calif. The Creekdippers have put out homemade albums, sold at shows and on the Internet, and Mr. Olson has just released an album with the Creekdippers, ''My Own Jo Ellen'' (HighTone Records). Mr. Olson is a former member of the Jayhawks, and his tunes hark back to the rooted folk-rock of the Band, though with the latter-day weariness that was a hallmark of 1990's alt-country rock. In an updated fiddle tune he sang matter-of-factly about polluted ''Ben Johnson's Creek,'' where ''the grass, it tastes like turpentine.'' He also had songs about togetherness, like ''Walking Through Nevada'' and ''Someone to Talk With,'' for which Ms. Williams slipped on stage to harmonize.</p>
