        <p>The question was simple: for as long as you have played football, have you ever been on the futile side of a rivalry like Tennessee versus Jacksonville, the side where Jacksonville now resides?</p>
        <p>''I can't say that I have,'' Titans safety Blaine Bishop said here at Adelphia Coliseum on Monday night after Tennessee had smacked Jacksonville, 27-13, for the Titans' fifth consecutive victory in the series.</p>
        <p>''Let's see,'' said Titans receiver Yancey Thigpen. ''I guess I've played football for the last 22 years. Nope, can't say that's ever happened to me.''</p>
        <p>But Marcus Robertson, another Titans safety, understood Jacksonville's plight. ''Hey, I went to Iowa State for four years,'' Robertson said. ''I don't recall us ever beating Nebraska. As a matter of fact, it was just as ugly as this.''</p>
        <p>Iowa State's nickname is the Cyclones; that pretty much describes the Jaguars' condition -- spinning, tossed for a loop, all swept away.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what is going on here,'' Fred Taylor, Jacksonville's running back, said. ''But we had better figure it out. This is getting old and tiresome. We've had just about as much from them as we can take.''</p>
        <p>Frank Wycheck, Tennessee's tight end, said: ''I was wondering what they would say after the game. There are only so many times you can go to the well with the excuse, 'We didn't play very well.' ''</p>
        <p>There are no excuses. When the Titans see the Jaguars, they see red. They see easy prey. They pounce.</p>
        <p>And when the Jaguars see the Titans, they crumble.</p>
        <p>Imagine if you were Jacksonville. You win 15 games last season and lose only 3, but all three losses were to Tennessee. In each game the stakes grew larger, but so did the gap between the teams. Then you work the entire off-season to close that gap, to match the Titans. You come here and, once again, you collapse.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville is part of a larger group -- the American Football Conference Central -- that the Titans have dominated recently. Tennessee is 19-2 in its last 21 games in the division. The Titans have also won all 12 games played in their new stadium, including the miracle-lateral playoff victory last season over Buffalo. They won the A.F.C. title here last season, represented the conference admirably in the Super Bowl in losing to St. Louis and they now appear primed for much more. After a season-opening 16-13 loss at Buffalo, Tennessee has won five straight games.</p>
        <p>In the National Football Conference, every team is chasing two elite, unbeaten teams: St. Louis and Minnesota. The A.F.C. picture is more competitive, with Miami, the Jets and Tennessee each with 5-1 records.</p>
        <p>But for now, Tennessee looks like the A.F.C. team to beat.</p>
        <p>''We had our problems without a doubt,'' said Jaguars Coach Tom Coughlin, whose team fell to a 2-5 record. ''They do a good job of creating some matchup problems. Everyone for us was focused and real excited about this opportunity. We lost some physical battles. It's not a pleasant situation to be in. Frustration -- it's a good word and it sums up our situation right now.''</p>
        <p>Tennessee is capable not only of beating most teams, but also of beating them up. Its defense hits with power from the first play to the last one; on offense, the big back Eddie George punishes tacklers with a bruising, direct running style.</p>
        <p>A key factor that helps make the Titans a serious contender to return to the Super Bowl this season is the addition of Mike Heimerdinger as offensive coordinator. Heimerdinger has helped quarterback Steve McNair play a more vertical passing game and, over all, a more relaxed game. Heimerdinger arrived from the Denver Broncos during the off-season and his play calling mirrors that of his college roommate, Denver Coach Mike Shanahan. Nearly every call feeds off the last one. Like Shanahan, Heimerdinger is always trying to set you up to knock you down.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, the Titans' game plan. Tennessee began the game throwing flare passes out of the backfield from McNair to George. Then, to set up the Titans' first touchdown of the game, McNair faked a screen pass to the right to George and then threw a screen pass over the middle to Wycheck. The Jaguars were completely fooled, chasing George instead. Wycheck rumbled 17 yards to the Jacksonville 2. Tennessee soon scored and the Jacksonville free fall was on.</p>
        <p>''Our offense is ahead of the pace it was at this time last season,'' Bishop said. ''That is exciting. We know what we can do on defense, but now the offense is gaining that kind of confidence. That makes us a dangerous team. We're getting ahead on teams and forcing them to play catch-up against our defense, which is the perfect situation for our type of attacking defense. Our offense is becoming as physical as our defense. There is a long way to go, but if we can keep this up, maybe we'll get another crack at the big boys again.''</p>
        <p>He was talking about the Super Bowl champion Rams.</p>
        <p>''Hey, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves,'' Robertson said. ''It's one game at a time and after this week we still have a game to go just to get to the halfway mark of the season.''</p>
        <p>The Titans play at Baltimore on Sunday and at Washington after that, two stern tests. But after that they play Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Cleveland, Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Cleveland again and then Dallas. This team can handle that schedule.</p>
        <p>Up and down the Titans' lineup, there are draft choices, home-grown talent, who are producing. The latest is the fourth-year receiver Derrick Mason, who is hitting his stride and compensating for the loss for the season of receiver Kevin Dyson to injury. Mason is fast and quick, determined and opportunistic. So much like the rest of the Titans.</p>
        <p>''He's a beast right now,'' George said.</p>
        <p>So are the Titans.</p>
