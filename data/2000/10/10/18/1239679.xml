        <p>A willing one or not, Christoph Eschenbach has been identified as a candidate for the music directorship of the New York Philharmonic. He was at Carnegie Hall on Monday night as conductor of the NDR Symphony Orchestra from the north of Germany, one of his many executive jobs around the world. Given Mr. Eschenbach's itinerary, which sends him ricocheting from Hamburg to Paris to Chicago to Houston and back, one wonders how he might squeeze in the Philharmonic. Maybe there would be time on alternate Mondays.</p>
        <p>The NDR, playing a fairly standard program, showed itself a cut above the usual German orchestra, although its solidity and reliability also identified its limits. The glow of the Berlin Philharmonic and its international peers is not to be found here. The largely German and wholly Romantic program, on the other hand, lay easily with the sensibilities of these players. Weber's Overture to ''Euryanthe'' began the evening; Schoenberg's curious adaptation of the Brahms G minor Piano Quartet ended it; and serving as scented bait for the less committed ticket buyer, the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, with Midori, came in between. The bait seems to have worked; Carnegie Hall was pretty well filled.</p>

        <p>A willing one or not, Christoph Eschenbach has been identified as a candidate for the music directorship of the New York Philharmonic. He was at Carnegie Hall on Monday night as conductor of the NDR Symphony Orchestra from the north of Germany, one of his many executive jobs around the world. Given Mr. Eschenbach's itinerary, which sends him ricocheting from Hamburg to Paris to Chicago to Houston and back, one wonders how he might squeeze in the Philharmonic. Maybe there would be time on alternate Mondays.</p>
        <p>The NDR, playing a fairly standard program, showed itself a cut above the usual German orchestra, although its solidity and reliability also identified its limits. The glow of the Berlin Philharmonic and its international peers is not to be found here. The largely German and wholly Romantic program, on the other hand, lay easily with the sensibilities of these players. Weber's Overture to ''Euryanthe'' began the evening; Schoenberg's curious adaptation of the Brahms G minor Piano Quartet ended it; and serving as scented bait for the less committed ticket buyer, the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, with Midori, came in between. The bait seems to have worked; Carnegie Hall was pretty well filled.</p>
        <p>The NDR's orchestra sound is bigger than it is beautiful, but in the Weber, the subtleties of phrase seemed to have needed little conductorial explaining.</p>
        <p>Midori's playing was remarkable not only for its steely poise in exceedingly difficult music but also for its freedom of tempo and broad dynamic contrasts. This is the same player whose fate I bemoaned when she was a highly publicized prodigy in the 1980's. How wrong I was. Midori keeps growing, and there is added pleasure with every new experience of her. The constant tempo adjustments made good sense in music as flamboyant as this, but they pose problems for a conductor. Mr. Eschenbach watched his soloist like a hawk and kept the various parties together with skill.</p>
        <p>Why Schoenberg made his Brahms arrangement is a puzzle. There are benefits, especially when new sounds emerge. Reducing an orchestral piece to one or two pianos produces a kind of X-ray: the black-and-white of keyboard sound has a kind of skeletal clarity. Here the process is reversed, but the results are equally interesting. Assigning different instruments to the individual voices of chords lights up harmonic movement, like a CT scan in which your brain takes on colors you never knew it had. A lot of the textures in the arrangement are impossibly thick, and at big climaxes timpani strokes are poor substitutes for piano chords or octaves. The mallet percussion and various tinkles of the last movement are positively weird.</p>
        <p>This finale was just about all the NDR could handle. Sharp edges in the string playing began to dissolve; winds, brass and percussion got by, but the strains were evident. Mr. Eschenbach guided it all admirably. He cuts a dashing figure and certainly does not lack for energy.</p>
