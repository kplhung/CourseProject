        <p>Amid predictions by its developers that it would transform the use and storage of digital information by American households, the 3Com Corporation introduced an Internet appliance it called the Audrey yesterday. Unlike most Net appliances, which are basically stripped-down personal computers for Internet use only, Audrey is not aimed at the millions of American households that do not have computers. Eric Benhamou, the chairman and chief executive of 3Com, said the stylish $499 device, with its slim monitor and small wireless keyboard, was intended for the ''connected home, people who already have one or two PC's.'' The first of the company's new Ergo product line, the Audrey is meant easily to send and receive e-mail messages and provide access to the Internet. It can also create a household calendar and synchronize it with Palm hand-held devices.</p>
