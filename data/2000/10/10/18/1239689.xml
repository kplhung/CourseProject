        <p>Nine choreographers and their companies will be featured in ''France Moves,'' a festival of contemporary French dance at six New York theaters from April 23 to May 6.</p>
        <p>Making their American debuts will be Philippe Decoufle's Compagnie DCA at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Compagnie Josef Nadj at the Joyce Theater. Seen in New York debuts will be Lionel Hoche's MeMe BaNjO and Dominique Boivin's Compagnie Beau Geste, both at the French Institute Alliance Francaise, and Compagnie Boris Charmatz at the Kitchen.</p>
        <p>Return engagements are planned by Compagnie Maguy Marin (New Victory Theater), Compagnie Montalvo-Hervieu (Brooklyn Academy of Music), Angelin Preljocaj's Ballet Preljocaj (Joyce Theater) and Fred Bendongue's Compagnie Azanie (Danspace Project).</p>
        <p>Festival participants, chosen by Yorgos Loukos, the artistic director of ''France Moves'' and of the Lyon Opera Ballet, were announced on Monday at the Carlyle Hotel. The choreographers talked of the influence of American modern dance seen in France in the 1970's and of street dancing and African and Caribbean dance and music forms.</p>
        <p>Many of their pieces will be in mixed media. The themes of the dances range from Mr. Boivin's one-man journey through the history of dance to Mr. Preljocaj's exploration of the differences between instinctual and conceptual art epitomized by the work of Joseph Conrad and Marcel Duchamps. Mr. Decoufle blends magical tricks, interactive video and dance.</p>
        <p>The festival will also feature screenings of ''Le Mystere Babilee,'' a documentary by Patrick Bensard, director of the Cinematheque de la Danse, a film by Francois Verret about the ballerina and teacher Rosella Hightower (both at the French Institute) and short films selected by Mr. Bensard (Brooklyn Academy).</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 31, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Oct. 18 about ''France Moves,'' a festival of contemporary French dance to be presented at six New York theaters from April 23 to May 6, misspelled the surname of the artist whose work helped inspire one work. He was Marcel Duchamp, not Duchamps.</p>
