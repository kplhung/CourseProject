        <p>The question has followed the Yankees and the Mets all season and both teams have mostly deflected it. The Yankees never really wanted to talk about the Mets and the Mets felt the same way about the Yankees. Wait and see if the Subway Series happens and we will talk about it then, they said.</p>
        <p>Now the Yankees and the Mets have days and days to discuss it because the Yankees rallied from a four-run deficit to defeat the Seattle Mariners, 9-7, and win the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>The Mets won the National League pennant on Monday and the two teams will play in Game 1 of the World Series on Saturday night. Hold your breath, buy those tokens and be thankful for something that is extremely rare.</p>
        <p>For the first time since 1956, there will be a Subway Series.</p>
        <p>''For all of us, it's going to be an ultimate experience,'' said Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager. ''When you get asked a question that is prefaced with, 'Can you ever believe . . .' or 'Can you ever imagine . . .', it gives you a different feel.</p>
        <p>''The only reference point I have to go to is interleague play, but this is for all the marbles,'' he added. ''The stakes are certainly real high now and therefore I think you turn that emotion up exponentially.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are trying to win their third straight World Series championship. The Mets, who have been overshadowed by the Yankees for the last five years, have a chance to win their first title since 1986. Let the endless questions begin over dinner tables, in bars and in schoolyards; then let those long-awaited games begin.</p>
        <p>''I'd love to see the Subway Series,'' the Mets' Todd Zeile said Monday. ''I have unfinished business with the Yankees, as far as I'm concerned anyway. They've eliminated me the other three times I've had a chance to be in the postseason. They've celebrated on what was my home field all three times.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' David Justice took an optimistic view of the situation. ''New York can't lose,'' he said. ''Everything is going to be right here in the city limits. I guess you could say we're making history with this series.''</p>
        <p>Phillips was in agreement on that issue. ''I'm happy it's the Yankees,'' he said. ''Now that we can say that; I'm happy it's the Yankees. I think it's extremely good for baseball, for the city of New York.''</p>
        <p>As the Yankees sprayed each other with Champagne in a packed clubhouse, a voice screeched, ''Does anybody know how to get to Shea?'' Of course, the Yankees do. It is eight miles from Yankee Stadium, but it will probably feel like eight blocks when these games are played. Eight city blocks, because the series is all about New York City and securing baseball supremacy.</p>
        <p>''The city is going to be rocking,'' Bernie Williams said. ''It's great to be a part of it.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre was a boy from Brooklyn attending the 1956 World Series when the Yankees halted the Brooklyn Dodgers, and he shook his head and thought about just how different the 2000 World Series would be.</p>
        <p>It will be bigger, so much bigger, with families being pitted against families. This is another Subway Series, but this one is in a different stratosphere.</p>
        <p>''At that time, baseball was just baseball,'' Torre said. ''Now it's more than just a baseball game. I hope the people behave themselves because this could break up some families.''</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter, who lives on the Upper East Side, said, ''If we win, I might buy a place in the city. If we lose, I might have to move someplace else.''</p>
        <p>Mets catcher Mike Piazza was one of the few players who embraced the possibility of a Subway Series even before both teams had clinched their league championships.</p>
        <p>''People would come from all over the world,'' he had said. ''It would be a madhouse. It would be crazy.''</p>
        <p>It is finally here and it should be enjoyed. Even Seattle Manager Lou Piniella, a former Yankee, sounded as if he planned to enjoy it.</p>
        <p>''Baseball has always been special here in this city and the Mets have their legion of fans and the Yankees certainly have theirs,'' Piniella said. ''And now they can go spill beer on each other. They can get raucous with each other and I can watch it from afar.''</p>
