        <p>Can a futuristic, slightly lopsided-looking, two-part plastic contraption be the key to good coffee? A vacuum coffee maker, called the Utopia, has just been introduced by Starbucks. It uses a method of brewing coffee that produces a truer, cleaner coffee flavor than a French press, a percolator or a filter drip pot.</p>
        <p>Vacuum coffee makers are usually complicated stove-top glass gadgets. The Starbucks model, made by Bodum, is electric and simpler to use. As water in the lower carafe is heated, it rises through a funnel to the top container, creating a vacuum in the lower carafe and saturating the ground coffee sitting on a filter screen in the top container. The finished brew then drops back through a filter screen into the lower carafe. The process takes about three minutes.</p>

        <p>The Utopia keeps coffee hot and can be programmed for automatic brewing. But it will make no fewer than 4 cups and no more than 10. And while rinsing it is easy, drying it by hand is not, so air-drying is the way to go. The Utopia is $169 at Starbucks stores and from www.starbucks.com.</p>
