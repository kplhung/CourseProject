        <p>The Nets' injury curse struck down one of their pillars last night when forward Keith Van Horn broke his left leg in the second quarter of a 99-94 exhibition loss to the Magic in Orlando. Nets officials said he would be out for four to six weeks, which means Van Horn will miss at least the first two weeks of the regular season, which begins Oct. 31 against Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Van Horn, who turns 25 on Monday, fell awkwardly on his left leg after going up for an offensive rebound against Orlando's Don Reid and Bo Outlaw with 5 minutes 2 seconds left in the second quarter. It was the first preseason game he had played; he sat out the first two with  strained ligaments in his left knee.</p>

        <p>The Nets' injury curse struck down one of their pillars last night when forward Keith Van Horn broke his left leg in the second quarter of a 99-94 exhibition loss to the Magic in Orlando. Nets officials said he would be out for four to six weeks, which means Van Horn will miss at least the first two weeks of the regular season, which begins Oct. 31 against Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Van Horn, who turns 25 on Monday, fell awkwardly on his left leg after going up for an offensive rebound against Orlando's Don Reid and Bo Outlaw with 5 minutes 2 seconds left in the second quarter. It was the first preseason game he had played; he sat out the first two with  strained ligaments in his left knee.</p>
        <p>''It's just unfortunate,'' Nets Coach Byron Scott said. ''We just  have to look forward to getting him back. He just went in for an offensive  rebound and landed oddly and he is out for a while. We've just got to pick  up the pieces.''</p>
        <p>Last season, the Nets lost 272 player games to injury, fourth most in the league. Forward Jayson Williams was forced to retire in June because of a leg injury, and the Nets were already expecting to be without  shooting guard Kerry Kittles, who is recovering from knee surgery.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we need to change the colors of our uniforms because we  have bad luck as far as injuries go,'' said the veteran shooting guard Kendall Gill, who was sitting out because of a scratched left cornea. ''I have never seen anything like this in the history of sports. To have a team that is decimated by injuries every year to key players.''</p>
        <p>Gill said as soon as he saw Van Horn fall, he knew something was  wrong. ''I kind of thought it was bad, the way he was holding his leg,'' Gill said. ''He didn't twist it or anything. All of his weight just came down.''</p>
        <p>Van Horn had X-rays at the arena. ''He was disappointed, I can tell you that much,'' Gill said.</p>
        <p>Van Horn's injury is the latest, and most devastating under Scott, their new coach. The team learned on the first day of practice that its leading rebounder, the reserve forward Jamie Feick, needed surgery to repair his left Achilles' tendon. Feick will not be able to start rehabilitating until November and may not be able  to return for two more months.</p>
        <p>Lucious Harris, a reserve shooting guard, underwent hernia surgery at the beginning of training camp and may not return until December.</p>
        <p>Scott would not say that the Nets are snake-bitten. ''I'm still not looking at it that way,'' he said. ''You've got to play with what you got. We played the first two preseason games without him. We'll just throw some different guys in there and see if we can go without him. You can't really replace him, he's a very valuable part of our team. Hopefully two or three guys can do the work of Van Horn.''</p>
        <p>Playing small forward last night, the rookie Stephen Jackson led the  Nets with 20 points.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-10-inch, 255-pound Van Horn missed only two games last  season. He averaged 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds, both second most on the  team.</p>
