        <p>By all appearances, the double whammy of two Broadway flops in a row -- ''On the Town'' and ''The Wild Party'' -- spelled danger for the Joseph Papp Public Theater and its artistic director, George C. Wolfe. The Public had to foot most of the bill for the shows' collective losses: $14 million, a punishing amount for a nonprofit theater.</p>
        <p>Making matters worse, the shows produced at the Public's five-theater home on Lafayette Street in the East Village and at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park have mostly failed to generate the kind of buzz that the Public has reveled in at other points in its vaunted history.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Wolfe heads into his eighth season at the helm, these issues have helped to make him and his theater hot topics of industry discussion, particularly because of the Public's historic place at the fulcrum of the New York theater world. Theater veterans have been asking why the Public's board backed Mr. Wolfe on yet another risky Broadway venture so soon after the last one, and how it could stand by him when artistic directors around the country have been let go simply for losing subscribers. They wonder why the Public Theater hasn't engendered the kind of excitement it did during the tenure of its founder, Joseph Papp, and why the theater's stages are rarely active at the same time.</p>
        <p>''It's just a matter of time -- you can't continue to lose money,'' said an artistic director at a nonprofit theater outside New York, discussing Mr. Wolfe's tenure on the condition of anonymity. ''Even the most beloved artistic directors -- the board turns around on them.''</p>
        <p>According to the Public's board, however, Mr. Wolfe isn't going anywhere soon. ''I don't have much patience for people who say this about George and that about George,'' said Kenneth B. Lerer, for six years the board's chairman. ''He clearly brings out emotions in people. But from where I sit, he's done a brilliant job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lerer said that when Mr. Wolfe, 46, assumed his post in 1993, the theater's endowment was $10.3 million, the deficit was $5.8 million, and box office income was down to $750,000. The theater under Mr. Papp's short-lived successor, JoAnne Akalaitis, had been widely considered adrift.</p>
        <p>Box office revenue has since doubled, the endowment is at $33 million (helped by a $20 million grant from the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust in 1995), the $12-million budget is balanced, and the Public has raised nearly $20 million of the $50 million needed for building improvements, including the construction in 1998 of Joe's Pub, the successful cabaret performance space.</p>
        <p>The theater's supporters say that Mr. Wolfe's artistic stature has been proved by a string of hits, including ''Angels in America,'' ''The Tempest'' (with Patrick Stewart), ''Jelly's Last Jam'' and ''Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk.'' They also point to strong work at the Public like Diana Son's ''Stop Kiss'' and last summer's park production of ''The Winter's Tale,'' and the nurturing of artists like the composer Adam Guettel and the playwright Nilo Cruz.</p>
        <p>''The Wild Party,'' a musical by Michael John LaChiusa and Mr. Wolfe based on the Jazz Age poem by Joseph Moncure March, is exactly the kind of work the Public should be doing, they said, reviews and financial returns notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>Gail Merrifield Papp, Mr. Papp's widow and a board member, said that her husband would have been pleased with Mr. Wolfe's Public. ''I feel it's in very good hands,'' she said. ''I can't think of any other hands I would rather have it be in.''</p>
        <p>Underlying these contradictory assessments is a changing Off Broadway where the definitions of success are in flux. While reputations were formerly made with experimental work, now nonprofit theaters feel pressure to produce more mainstream fare with Broadway potential.</p>
        <p>The larger-than-life Mr. Papp cultivated both artistic risk and financial reward. In any judgment of Mr. Wolfe, it is Mr. Papp's shadow that looms large.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papp, who died nine years ago, started the Public Theater in 1954, offering free Shakespeare in a Lower East Side church. He expanded to the East River Park Amphitheater, added a touring mobile theater and then established a permanent cultural landmark in Central Park at what became the Delacorte Theater.</p>
        <p>In 1966 Mr. Papp transformed the Astor Library on Lafayette Street into the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater, which fast became a hub of activity, from Latino theater festivals to Sam Shepard productions to Shakespeare marathons to film screenings. At the same time, through productions like ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' and, above all, ''A Chorus Line,'' Mr. Papp established a beachhead on Broadway and earned tens of millions for his nonprofit theater.</p>
        <p>These days the Public is not the focal point it once was. There are fewer cultural events: during Mr. Papp's 1978-79 season, for example, the Public produced 37 (thanks partly to the revenue from ''A Chorus Line''); during Mr. Wolfe's 1998-99 season, the Public sponsored 14 projects, including Joe's Pub, a puppet theater festival and a flamenco performance, and last season the number dropped to 10, including the pub. In the last few years the attention appears to have been elsewhere, particularly smaller nonprofit institutions like the MCC Theater, which produced ''Wit,'' and the Vineyard Theater, which produced ''How I Learned to Drive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe continues to produce unconventional plays in the Papp tradition, but now that does not necessarily translate into ticket sales or press attention. And with good work  coming from many nonprofit theaters, it may not be possible for the Public to consistently produce the volume or fireworks it once did.</p>
        <p>''The marketplace is now judged by a whole series of external factors that have to do with the level of hype that a production receives,'' Mr. Wolfe said. ''Our investment is in producing challenging and exciting work but also in nurturing and feeding work that would remain marginalized in the new theatrical landscape.''</p>
        <p>But many in the theater world believe that the Public's lower wattage has more to do with Mr. Wolfe than a hype-driven environment. Even some of those who admire him as a director said, at least privately, that he was more focused on his own career than on the Public and that he had trouble sharing power or, for that matter, the spotlight. Although Mark Litvin is the theater's managing director, just about everyone agreed that the Public, unlike peers such as Lincoln Center Theater and Manhattan Theater Club, was essentially a one-man show. Mr. Wolfe has no equally powerful counterpart on the business side, and those who  have come close have not survived long.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Wolfe has taken a strong interest in a few artists like the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, many say he pays considerably less attention to productions that are not his own.</p>
        <p>''To be a good artistic director, you don't necessarily not have to have an ego, but you have to love artists,'' said one artistic director who spoke on the condition of anonymity.''You have to love artists other than yourself.''</p>
        <p>But several playwrights and actors who have worked at the Public recently in productions that were not Mr. Wolfe's said that he stopped by at rehearsals and came through when it counted. ''He wears a lot of hats,'' said Ms. Parks, who wrote ''In the Blood,'' which the Public produced last year, ''but I think he has a lot of heads.''</p>
        <p>Many artists said they found Mr. Wolfe's input inspiring. ''He gets into a state where he becomes very passionate and kind of obsessive, and that's contagious,'' said Liev Schreiber, who recently starred in the Public's ''Hamlet,'' directed by Andrei Serban. ''And it makes you value your own work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe said he wanted the best for his artists and was not ''competitive that way.''</p>
        <p>He conceded, though, that when he started at the Public, he wanted to do everything himself to learn how everything was done. Mr. Wolfe said he was now open to sharing the load. Mr. Lerer said the board would soon hire a high-level financial executive.</p>
        <p>But for all that, Mr. Wolfe said, Mr. Papp established the Public Theater as an institution driven largely by ''the cult of personality,'' and he added that he was committed to carrying on that tradition. ''That had been the legacy of the institution,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While his last two Broadway experiences required ''healing,'' as he put it, Mr. Wolfe said he had resolved not to come away embittered or newly cautious.</p>
        <p>''Every experience teaches you something,'' he said. ''And it's very important that no experience teaches you fear.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe, whose play ''The Colored Museum'' opened at The Public to wide acclaim in 1986,  when he was 32, said he felt responsible for ''The Wild Party,'' which lost about $6 million, but had no regrets. He said it was the kind of creative, albeit stormy, enterprise that makes a theater stronger.</p>
        <p>If anything, it was ''On the Town,''  which lost nearly $8 million, that generated more debate within the Public, given that Broadway was already revival-heavy and that the commercial producers who had put $1 million into its first production in Central Park had pulled out for the Broadway run.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe said that he pressed ahead because he believed in the show's ''foolish kind of joy'' and that it might be profitable. ''The belief that the show could be commercially successful was looming in my head more than usual,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lerer, the board chairman and  a senior vice president at America Online, said that the Public was  keenly aware that the success of a nonprofit theater was increasingly measured in commercial terms: How many productions has it moved to Broadway? How many Tony Awards has it won?</p>
        <p>''I think that if you don't try to work at the outer edge of the envelope and get a bigger footprint these days, you get smaller -- pushed aside,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And, he pointed out, Mr. Papp took many plays to Broadway, ''so the notion that we are doing something inconsistent with the past is ludicrous.''</p>
        <p>As to the quantity of work the Public is producing, Mr. Lerer said,  ''If every play you put on down there loses money, you have to question whether it makes sense to do 12 shows or 6.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe said that he decided to direct the Public's resources toward artistic development: 30 to 40 play readings a year, 10 to 15 staged workshops, the commissioning of new work and a summer Shakespeare laboratory.</p>
        <p>This season's productions include ''Kit Marlowe,'' by David Grimm; ''Topdog/Underdog,'' by Ms. Parks; ''Dogeaters,'' by Jessica Hagedorn; ''Book of the Dead,'' by John Moran; ''References to Salvador Dali Make Me Hot,'' by Jose Rivera, starring Rosie Perez; and, Mr. Wolfe said, possibly one other show.</p>
        <p>''Other theaters have down time,'' Mr. Wolfe said. ''There is no down time.''</p>
        <p>Still, people who work in New York theater often suggest that Mr. Wolfe, who earns $210,000 a year, has his eye on the door. Adding fuel to such suspicions, Mr. Wolfe's new agent, Joyce P. Ketay, sent a letter last month to Broadway producers in which she said, ''I know I do not have to introduce you to this amazing man, but I did want to let you know that although George will continue as artistic director of the Public Theater, he is available for other projects.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe said that the letter was simply a way for Ms. Ketay to introduce herself to the industry and to field the one-time offers he often got and was willing to consider.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe added that he was happy at the Public and was planning to stay. ''People have been speculating I've been leaving since three days after I got there,'' he said. ''It's an ongoing commitment.''</p>
