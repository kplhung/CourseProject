        <p>I.B.M. Meets Forecasts, But Revenue Falls Short  Unable to get enough microchips to make everything it could have sold, I.B.M. reported that it had squeezed out the profits Wall Street had expected for the third quarter, but revenue fell short of projections.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. said that it earned $2 billion, or $1.08 a share, up 16 percent from $1.8 billion, or 93 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. But revenue grew just 3 percent, shy of analysts' forecasts. Before the results were announced, shares of I.B.M. closed up $1.88, to $113. They fell below $100 after hours. [Page C8.]</p>
        <p>Intel Exceeds Lowered Forecasts  After warning last month that its revenue would not meet expectations, Intel reported third-quarter results that beat analysts' lowered forecasts. The company also reported stagnant chip sales and projected a relatively soft holiday season. But executives said they did not see signs of a price war among chip makers or of a widespread drop in demand for personal computers. Market Place. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Citigroup and Merrill Beat Estimates  Citigroup and Merrill Lynch posted third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. Citigroup's profit rose 26 percent while Merrill's earnings rose 53 percent. But the strong results did not help the performance of either company's shares. Shares of Citigroup declined $1.44, to $49.38, while Merrill fell 56 cents, to $57.81. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Stock Prices Move Sharply Lower  Talk of weak earnings continued to plague stocks, and major market gauges moved sharply lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 76.32 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,213.96. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index shed 24.65 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,349.97. The Dow Jones industrial average slumped by 149.09 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,089.71. [C15.]</p>
        <p>Philip Morris Meets Expectations  Despite antismoking advertising and record-high prices, a resurgence in domestic cigarette sales helped lift profit at Philip Morris by 6.8 percent, in line with estimates. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Spanish Power Utility to Buy a Rival  In a friendly deal that will create one of the world's biggest power companies, Grupo Endesa of Spain agreed to acquire a domestic rival, Iberdrola, for stock and cash worth about $12.7 billion. [World Business, Section W.]</p>
        <p>Importance of Effort and Calculus  For Carol Bartz, the chief executive of Autodesk, which makes design software, there are no bad bosses. Even with the worst ones, you learn how not to treat people. She doesn't believe in doing anything halfway, telling her 12-year-old daughter, ''If you have a test, why not try for an A?'' A computer science degree opened doors for her when there were few opportunities for women, and if she could wave a magic wand, every girl would pass college freshman calculus. The Boss. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Hedge Fund Manager Is Arrested  A 23-year-old hedge fund manager was arrested and charged with attempting to defraud investors in his fund, Ashbury Capital Partners, officials said. [C15.]</p>
        <p>Judge Rules Against Tax Shelter  A federal judge ruled that one company's tax shelter was a sham and noted that 85 other large corporations used the same deduction to avoid paying $6 billion in taxes. [C12.]</p>
