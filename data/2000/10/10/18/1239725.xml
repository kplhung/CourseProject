      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The White House said today that President Clinton would veto the latest version of a bill restoring money to Medicare because it gave too much money to health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration insisted that Congress shift money from H.M.O.'s to hospitals, home health care agencies and other health care providers.</p>
        <p>Hospitals would presumably be the chief beneficiaries of the administration's veto threat.</p>
        <p>But Richard H. Wade, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said tonight, ''We are not supporting the veto threat.''</p>
        <p>Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the association, said a veto could imperil billions of dollars in relief for health care providers and the patients they serve.</p>
        <p>''We would hope there could be a bipartisan approach to resolve the differences here,'' Mr. Pollack said. ''A veto threat does not engender the bipartisan cooperation needed to enact this important legislation.''</p>
        <p>If no bill becomes law this year, elderly people could still receive health care under Medicare, but payments to providers would be cut by a 1997 law.</p>
        <p>President Clinton contends that many H.M.O.'s are already overpaid by Medicare.</p>
        <p>John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said today, ''Instead of passing an enforceable patients' bill of rights, Congress is on the verge of giving billions of dollars of Medicare money to the same H.M.O.'s that have fought tooth and nail to defeat patient protections.''</p>
        <p>Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, and Jacob J. Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said they would recommend that President Clinton veto the Medicare bill unless Congress reduced the increases in payments to H.M.O.'s. White House officials said Mr. Clinton would follow that advice.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, the administration demanded that Congress require H.M.O.'s to stay in the Medicare program and preserve existing benefits for three years.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said: ''We insist on accountability. H.M.O.'s say they need more money so they won't have to drop coverage or benefits. We want an assurance that, if they receive more money, they will continue to provide coverage and benefits.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, many health plans have pulled out of Medicare or reduced benefits, saying their costs outstripped the payments they received from the government. By increasing those payments, Congress hopes to reverse the exodus.</p>
        <p>The Medicare bill would raise payments to health care providers by $26 billion to $28 billion over five years. Mr. Podesta said that H.M.O.'s would get ''well over a third'' of the money.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, who is chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, rejected the administration's veto threat as so much bluster.</p>
        <p>''A veto of the Medicare relief bill would deny millions of seniors critical access to the health care they need,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''Nearly one million Medicare beneficiaries were dropped from their current health plans last year through no choice or fault of their own.''</p>
        <p>Medicare provides health care to 39 million elderly or disabled people. To slow the program's growth, Congress in 1997 cut payments to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. The savings far exceeded what Congress intended.</p>
        <p>Members of Congress from both parties have drafted numerous proposals to restore some money cut from Medicare. Payments to hospitals are increased each year to reflect changes in the cost of the goods and services they use. In 1997, Congress ordered that the annual inflation update be cut 1.1 percentage points in 2001 and again in 2002.</p>
        <p>Republicans have decided to pay the full update in 2001 and to restore half of the money cut in 2002. The White House said that this was not enough, and that hospitals should receive the full inflation allowance for both years.</p>
