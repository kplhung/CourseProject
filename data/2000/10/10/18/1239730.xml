        <p>Despite hundreds of millions of dollars in antismoking advertising and record-high prices, a resurgence in domestic cigarette sales is providing some of the nation's largest tobacco companies with their biggest gains in years.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Philip Morris Companies, whose Marlboro, Virgina Slims, Parliament and other brands command slightly more than 50 percent of the United States market, reported its best earnings since 1997, the year before the $206 billion national tobacco settlement was reached.

        <p>Despite hundreds of millions of dollars in antismoking advertising and record-high prices, a resurgence in domestic cigarette sales is providing some of the nation's largest tobacco companies with their biggest gains in years.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Philip Morris Companies, whose Marlboro, Virgina Slims, Parliament and other brands command slightly more than 50 percent of the United States market, reported its best earnings since 1997, the year before the $206 billion national tobacco settlement was reached. And, later this week, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, the maker of Camel and Winston cigarettes, is expected to report its second consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris said yesterday that its third-quarter profit from operations rose 6.8 percent, to $2.24 billion, or 99 cents a share, compared with $2.1 billion, or 87 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose to $20.06 billion from $19.88 billion.</p>
        <p>The results matched analysts' estimates, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>In the most recent quarter, a gain of $139 million, or 4 cents a share, on the sale of a French candy business made net income $2.32 billion, or $1.03 a share. In the quarter a year earlier, the company took charges of $136 million for closing a factory and reducing cigarette production in Brazil and $8 million for job cuts in the United States. Those charges made net income $2 billion, or 84 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Shares of Philip Morris rose 94 cents, to $31.69.</p>
        <p>Neither Philip Morris nor R. J. Reynolds attribute their improving results solely to rising cigarette sales. Philip Morris benefits greatly from its Kraft Foods division, which represents about a quarter of its operating income. In the third quarter, profit at Kraft Foods North America rose 7 percent, to $827 million, while sales rose 2.5 percent, to $4.28 billion. R. J. Reynolds has been bolstered by an aggressive share buyback program.</p>
        <p>But after an 8 percent drop in cigarette consumption last year, both companies say the reduction in the number of smokers has slowed drastically, to about 1 percent or 2 percent a year -- no more than in the years before the tobacco settlement  drove prices up to more than $3 a pack and spawned commercials that showed antismoking advocates throwing bodybags in front of Philip Morris's New York headquarters.</p>
        <p>''Smokers' habits have not altered from historic norms,'' said Tim Swanson, an analyst for A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons. ''They're virtually the same as they were prior to the settlement.''</p>
        <p>The return to traditional attrition rates is proving to be a windfall for the industry because price increases have more than offset the shrinking market. When tobacco companies raised prices by 45 cents in 1998 and by 18 cents again last year, the increases went primarily to cover the national settlement scheduled to be paid over 25 years. But this year, for the first time since the settlement, an additional 19-cent increase on cigarette prices has been used to increase earnings directly. For Philip Morris, United States cigarette profit rose 6.1 percent in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>''They have been able to take more than they need, and it's actually going to the bottom line,'' said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>Few analysts expected the tobacco settlement, with its many restrictions on tobacco advertising and set-asides for smoking-prevention efforts, would have much long-term effect on smoking. Still, many are surprised that smokers have recovered from the ''sticker shock'' of higher prices and so quickly, stemming the exodus from smoking in only one year. With consumers 18 to 24, a particularly important segment of the tobacco market, the prevalence of smoking has actually increased, to 36 percent from 32 percent, since the settlement, according to William P. Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.</p>
