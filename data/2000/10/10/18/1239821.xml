        <p>Nail biting over the outcome of the presidential campaign can possibly end on Sunday night, at 8:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>That is when Nickelodeon, the children's cable channel, will present the results of a presidential poll of its audience, which is being asked to vote on the race via the Nickelodeon Web site (www.nick.com) all week long, and, on Friday, by using an 800 number (800 485-4225) from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>For the last three presidential campaigns, the results of the Nickelodeon children's vote have corresponded with those of the general elections.</p>
        <p>''Come Sunday, we're probably going to be able to tell you who is going to be president,'' said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president and general manager.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zarghami said that the Nickelodeon poll has been accurate because the children have ''voted exactly like their parents,'' adding, ''At the end of the day, they get their values at home.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zarghami said she hoped the outcome of the Nickelodeon vote would be different from that of the general vote this year. Nickelodeon has tried to brief its audience on the issues through its ''Nick News'' program and on its Web site. And, she said, if the children voted differently from their parents, ''it would validate how much we have empowered them to think independently and make their own choices.''</p>
