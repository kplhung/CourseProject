        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: GUILTY PLEA IN PARK ATTACKS -- A Bronx man yesterday became the first indicted defendant to plead guilty to charges stemming from sexual attacks on women in Central Park after the Puerto Rican Day Parade in June. The man, Imanuel Nunez, 18, pleaded guilty to first-degree riot, admitting that he was part of a large group of men who doused women with water and groped them on June 11. Justice Bernard J. Fried of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said he would sentence Mr. Nunez six months in jail, four and a half years of probation and 250 hours of community service. Mr. Nunez had faced up to four years in prison on the original charges, which included first-degree sexual abuse and second-degree assault. Mr. Nunez, who was in jail since June 16, was released by the judge immediately yesterday because he had served two-thirds of his sentence and was entitled to time off for good behavior.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: PRIEST IN INQUIRY LEAVES CITY -- Msgr. Thomas J. Gradilone, the Roman Catholic priest from Queens who is under suspicion in a financial scandal at his former church, is undergoing psychological evaluation and counseling for an ''indefinite'' time in Ontario, church officials said yesterday. Monsignor Gradilone, 75, has been there since Oct. 1, when church officials disclosed that the Queens district attorney was investigating up to $2 million in missing donations while Monsignor Gradilone was pastor of Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church in Forest Hills. Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for the Diocese of Brooklyn, which includes Queens, would not identify the center in Canada. A law enforcement official said yesterday that because Monsignor Gradilone had not been charged with a crime, his whereabouts, first reported yesterday in The New York Post, were not an issue.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SOHO'S 'WALL' SAVED -- The Landmarks Preservation Commission yesterday rejected a plan to demolish ''The Wall,'' a seven-story sculpture built in SoHo in 1973 and whose preservation was recently championed by prominent artists. For three years, the owners of the office building, the SoHo International Arts Condominium at 599 Broadway, sought to raze the sculpture and replace it with an advertising billboard because they said the sculpture had damaged the building. In denying the application, the commission found that the sculpture, a series of aluminum girders by the artist Forrest W. Myers, was an important contribution to the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: HOSPITAL TO EXPAND -- Long Island College Hospital in Cobble Hill yesterday announced a $63 million plan to update its 516-bed hospital and several off-campus facilities. Included are an expanded emergency department, new radiological equipment, an improved recovery room for children, and a birthing center with Jacuzzis in each room. Financing comes from a $130 million endowment from Donald F. Othmer and Mildred Topp Othmer.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: UNION LEADER'S PLEA -- A labor union leader with District Council 37 pleaded guilty yesterday to stealing more than $3,000 by using a corporate credit card to pay for personal items. The leader, Alfred Cannizzo, headed local 1508, which represents uniformed park officers. His activities were uncovered during an audit by the union.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: COLLEGE PLAN MADE MORE FLEXIBLE -- Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday signed a law giving more investment options to parents using a state college savings program to help pay for their children's education expenses. The two-year-old program allows parents to put up to $5,000 a year per taxpayer in tax-favored accounts to pay for college, but investment decisions had been determined by the age of the beneficiary, with accounts for younger students being more heavily invested in stocks. Under the new law, backed by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who oversees the accounts, families will be able to increase the percentage of stocks in their accounts, regardless of the child's age.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: DRUG-TREATMENT CHIEF NAMED -- A director has been chosen for the New York State courts' program to place nonviolent drug-addicted offenders in treatment instead of jail. Judge Joseph J. Traficanti Jr. was named yesterday to oversee drug screening and treatment for offenders in criminal and family courts. Last June, when Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye announced the program, she said it should keep 10,000 people a year out of the prison population, now about 95,000. Judge Traficanti will also direct an organization of new, specialized courts for repeat misdemeanor offenders. He will remain a deputy chief administrative judge, responsible for state and local courts outside New York City.  Laura Mansnerus (NYT)</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: STATE AIDS LOBSTERMEN -- Gov. John G. Rowland yesterday ordered the release of nearly $1 million in direct financial aid to Connecticut lobstermen whose catch has been devastated by a sweeping and mysterious die-off. It is unclear how many lobstermen will benefit under the plan. The release of the Connecticut money, some $912,000, will lead to the release of half of $7.3 million in federal financial aid. The federal money is to be split equally between New York and Connecticut. But New York has not yet released its funds and has not yet qualified for the federal aid. Last fall, an estimated 11 million adult lobsters died, or 90 percent of the lobsters in Long Island Sound.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>FREEHOLD: PROSECUTOR HAS CANCER -- The Monmouth County prosecutor, John Kaye, has announced that he has prostate cancer, but he said it would not cause him to leave office. Mr. Kaye, 57, said he discovered he has cancer three weeks ago when he went in for routine testing because his father, who is 88, was found to have prostate cancer six years ago. Mr. Kaye said he decided to tell his staff, many of whom are male detectives, because rumors about his health were starting to spread, and to urge them all to be tested. He said he had not yet decided whether to have surgery or radiation treatments.</p>
