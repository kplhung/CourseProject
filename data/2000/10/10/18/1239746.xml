        <p>Is a lily like the Woolworth Building in need of gilding?</p>
        <p>A plan by the owners of the landmark building to add two-story penthouse apartments on the 29th-floor setbacks on either side of the central Gothic tower was greeted incredulously Monday by members of the Lower Manhattan community board.</p>
        <p>''Apostasy,'' one member said.</p>
        <p>''Only God should be able to put a penthouse addition on the Woolworth Building,'' came another comment.</p>
        <p>''Grotesquely inappropriate,'' concluded the landmarks committee of the community board, as it voted 6 to 0 against the proposal, even as it praised the owner's plan for what it called a ''sympathetic and sensitive'' storefront restoration.</p>
        <p>While the committee vote does not bind the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which will be considering the project later this month, it is a measure of the almost proprietary concern that neighbors take in the fate of the tower, which has inspired religious comparisons ever since its christening 87 years ago as a ''cathedral of commerce.''</p>
        <p>Designed by Cass Gilbert as the headquarters of Frank W. Woolworth's 5-and-10 empire -- and as the world's tallest building -- the 54-story tower has been owned for two years by the Witkoff Group, Rubin Schron, Sam Domb and other investors. Office tenants fill the lower 27 stories of the building on Broadway between Park Place and Barclay Street, but the owners plan to turn the slender upper half into apartments, with 50 to 85 units, depending on the size desired by buyers.</p>
        <p>Because a condominium conversion plan may be filed soon with the state, Steven C. Witkoff, president of the Witkoff Group, said yesterday that he was not at liberty to discuss the project.</p>
        <p>However, Roger F. Duffy, a partner in the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, which is designing the additions to and restoration of the building, said, ''We clearly revere the building and its history.''</p>
        <p>''We especially revere the fact that it's a bold statement of modernity,'' said Mr. Duffy, who is also the architect of the Skyscraper Museum now under construction in Battery Park City. ''They had to invent new ways of engineering to create this building.</p>
        <p>''We see this not as an ossified relic of the early 20th century,'' he said. ''We see this as a modernist icon. There's nothing inconsistent about being able to adapt it to a new, 21st century use.''</p>
        <p>The penthouses would replace cooling equipment that now occupies what might be described as the Woolworth Building's north and south shoulders. And they would be no more visible than the existing equipment, Mr. Duffy said.</p>
        <p>Each apartment would be clad primarily in glass and would have about 4,100 square feet of space.</p>
        <p>''They are designed as transparent structures,'' Mr. Duffy said, adding that they would not touch the copper mansard roof around the setback nor the upper tower. Pending city approval, Mr. Duffy said, the cooling equipment would be moved off the Woolworth Building and reinstalled on adjacent buildings, also owned by Witkoff, that are not landmarks.</p>
        <p>But the landmarks committee of the community board did not accept this assurance. In its resolution, the committee said that the penthouses would be ''highly visible'' and that the existing air-conditioning equipment ''appears more visually benign from a distance than the proposal.''</p>
        <p>The committee considered the penthouses so ''onerous,'' the resolution continued, that ''one member called them apostasy, another noted that one of the world's great landmarks was to be significantly altered for the benefit of exactly two residential units and a third said that the tower facade should not be altered in any way for any purpose, except pure restoration.''</p>
        <p>A pure restoration is what the owners envision for the street-level facade of the building, which was altered over time. ''None of the storefronts are original,'' Mr. Duffy said.</p>
        <p>In their research, the architects delved into the Cass Gilbert collection at the New-York Historical Society, which happens to be featuring the Woolworth Building in its current exhibition, ''Inventing the Skyline: The Architecture of Cass Gilbert.''</p>
        <p>The new plan for the Woolworth Building calls for matching original paint colors, recasting decorative cast iron panels and even creating a system of inside ducts to avoid the need for louvers on the exterior, Mr. Duffy said, ''so the outside could remain in appearance as it did in 1913.''</p>
        <p>Judy Duffy, the assistant district manager of Community Board 1, said the architectural presentation on Monday night had been ''very professional'' and conceded that an apartment in the Woolworth Building would be appealing.</p>
        <p>''I'd give my eyeteeth to live there,'' she said. ''But to add two glass penthouses? Why?''</p>
