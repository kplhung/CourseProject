        <p>Leo Anderson was surprised to be called on. He rose, waited for a microphone to be handed to him and slowly unfolded his crumpled index card. Then he put it to George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>''You seemed to overly enjoy -- as a matter of fact, be proud -- that Texas led the nation in execution of prisoners,'' Mr. Anderson, 45, an operating room technician, said to the Texas governor. ''Sir, did I misread your response, and are you really, really proud of the fact that Texas is No. 1 in executions?''</p>
        <p>It was perhaps the most direct question of the 90-minute session, and it elicited a direct response. ''No, I'm not proud of that,'' Governor Bush said, adding, ''If you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me.''</p>
        <p>After the debate ended, Mr. Anderson had another direct response. ''I didn't like it at all,'' he said of Mr. Bush's answer.</p>
        <p>And did the debate help him decide how he would vote?</p>
        <p>''Ralph Nader,'' Mr. Anderson said with some disgust as he plowed past reporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson was one of 131 people chosen by the Gallup Organization to question Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore in the town hall meeting here that served as the third and final presidential debate of the election season. Janet Brown, spokeswoman for the Commission on Presidential Debates, said the questioners were selected ''because they were uncommitted voters.'' Roughly one-third were truly undecided, while another third leaned toward Mr. Gore and another third leaned toward Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>They assembled at 12:30 this afternoon at the field house of Washington University and then were sequestered for the next seven and a half hours, their cell phones removed so their questions could not leak to the candidates.</p>
        <p>They submitted their questions -- 130 in all -- in writing to Jim Lehrer, the debate moderator and PBS anchor man. Nineteen of the questions concerned health care; 18 were about education; 12 were on international affairs. Mr. Lehrer screened the questions, picked representative ones and determined the order in which to ask them.</p>
        <p>The participants, all from the St. Louis area, spent several hours  practicing with the microphones and, as Ms. Brown, who wore a coat in the hall, put it, ''enduring extremely chilly temperatures'' in the field house.</p>
        <p>But they did not know who would be called on.</p>
        <p>''That was the neatest part about it,'' said Andrew Kosberg, 42, who teaches woodworking and American history and who got to ask a question. ''So everyone was sitting there on pins and needles, and then when your name is called; that's the biggest rush you can imagine.''</p>
        <p>But, like others, Mr. Kosberg said afterward that he was still undecided on a presidential pick. The most useful part of the evening, he said, was that while he leaned Democratic, ''I'm pleased to realize that Governor Bush would make a wonderful leader.''</p>
        <p>''I'm comfortable either way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The audience members were not allowed to ask the candidates follow-up questions, under the rules both campaigns had agreed on, and the microphones of the questioners were turned off after they asked their questions.</p>
        <p>Many questions were broad. For example, the first, by James Hankin, was, ''How do you feel about H.M.O.'s and insurance companies making the critical decisions that affect people's lives, instead of the medical professionals?''</p>
        <p>The format did not allow the candidates to be overly chatty with the questioners. After the first question, Mr. Gore said in response, ''Mr. Hankin, I don't feel good about it.''</p>
        <p>But later, when Mr. Gore tried to engage Mr. Kosberg, the teacher, by asking what grade he taught,  Mr. Lehrer swiftly stopped him, saying, ''That's a violation of your rule.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore afterward resisted his inclination to to try to engage people by asking them personal questions. On the subject of tax cuts, he said, ''Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year. I won't ask you. But if you do, you're in the top 1 percent. If you don't -- -- ''</p>
        <p>Here, Mr. Lehrer interrupted again, saying, ''It would be a violation of the rules.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore conceded, ''I'm not going to ask.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush stuck to the rules and engaged his questioners by confining himself to simple hellos. ''Hi, Angie,'' he said when Angela K. Pettig, who asked a question about education, was introduced.</p>
        <p>And to Norma Curby, ''Hi, Norma.''</p>
        <p>Cheri Fortney, 31, a special education teacher, said she was disappointed with both candidates because they were not specific enough about how they would accomplish their many proposals.</p>
        <p>And Cathy Murray, 50, a registered nurse who did not get to ask a question, said the debate had not helped her make up her mind either.</p>
        <p>''I want someone in the White House who won't lie to me about anything,'' Ms. Murray said. ''I don't want empty promises. Both candidates, there seemed to be a lot of emptiness there.''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PARTICIPANTS  Correction:  October 21, 2000, Saturday  An article on Wednesday about Gov. George W. Bush's criticism of Vice President Al Gore's economic plans misstated a question Mr. Bush was asked at the presidential debate on Tuesday. The moderator, Jim Lehrer, asked him to respond to Mr. Gore's criticism that the governor's proposed tax cut ''benefits the top 1 percent of the wealthiest Americans.'' Mr. Bush responded: ''Of course it does. If you pay taxes, you're going to get a benefit.'' Mr. Lehrer did not ask whether the proposal would benefit ''mainly'' that group.</p>
