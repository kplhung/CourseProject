        <p>Correction of Oct 16 and Oct 17 articles about suit against eBay involving auction of forged sports memorabilia; judge dismissed suit in its current form, but let plaintiffs refile case with more specific arguments; did not back eBay's motion to dismiss suit itself</p>

The judge did not support eBay's motion to dismiss the case itself. On Monday, the plaintiffs responded by refiling.</p>
