        <p>Tribute  He illustrated Eleanor Roosevelt's book ''Christmas.'' He created a woodcut of the presidential seal for the inauguration of John F. Kennedy. His virtuosic pen-and-ink drawings, watercolors and woodcuts illustrated fairy tales, children's books, religious works, cookbooks, fiction and nonfiction for private presses and trade book publishers. His name was Fritz Kredel. To mark the centenary of this prize-winning German-born illustrator, who came to the United States in 1938 and died in 1973, the Grolier Club, at 47 East 60th Street, Manhattan, is holding a retrospective exhibition. On view through Nov. 18, the ''Fritz Kredel Centennial Exhibition'' includes works never before shown.</p>
        <p>State of Mind  In the 150th year of statehood for California, a major exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will address the relationship between the state's arts and image in the last century. Running from Sunday through Feb. 25, ''Made in California: Art, Image, and Identity, 1900-2000'' features more than 800 works. The mediums include painting, sculpture, photography, graphic art, decorative art, costume and video. In addition more than 400 cultural documents -- tourist brochures, rock posters, labor pamphlets and documentary photographs from public and private collections nationwide -- will be assembled to convey California's history and image.</p>
        <p>Guys, Dolls et al.  How's this for a winning New York pairing: Pete Hamill and Damon Runyon? They'll be found together at 6 tonight at Chumley's, at 86 Bedford Street, Greenwich Village. With readings from his favorite Runyon passages, Mr. Hamill will usher in ''Gangs, Gangsters and Gangstas,'' a new season of the peripatetic Gotham Readers series under the auspices of the Museum of the City of New York.</p>
