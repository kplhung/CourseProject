        <p>WHITE Bordeaux at two meals in one day? Even in Bordeaux the odds are against it. But I did it last week, both times in the company of dedicated red wine producers.</p>
        <p>Bordeaux makes two styles of white wines: the sweet wines of Sauternes, led by the incomparable Chateau d'Yquem, and dry, white table wines, like those of Chateau Haut-Brion in the Graves region and Chateau Margaux in the Medoc. Sweet or dry, famous or little-known, Bordeaux white wines are in serious trouble.</p>
        <p>''White Bordeaux is the most neglected of all the great white wines of France,'' said Michael Aaron, the chairman of Sherry-Lehmann in New York. ''Everybody has forgotten them.''</p>
        <p>The table wines in particular deserve to be much better known and appreciated than they are. My first that day came at lunch in Libourne, about 30 miles east of the city of Bordeaux, where the owners of Chateau Clos l'Eglise, in Pomerol, and Barde-Haut in St.-Emilion, were showing off their latest vintages. Since they also own Chateau Haut-Bergey, in the Graves, which, like Haut-Brion, makes both red and white wine, lunch began with an Haut-Bergey white.</p>
        <p>The second came at dinner that evening at Cordeillan-Bages, a former chateau turned into an elegant restaurant and hotel in Pauillac in the Medoc region north of the city of Bordeaux. Sylvie Cazes-Regimbeau, whose family owns Lynch-Bages, started dinner with the rare Lynch-Bages white.</p>
        <p>Both white wines that day were made from sauvignon blanc and semillon, the classic Bordeaux white grape varieties. Both wines were delicious: medium- to light-bodied, intensely flavored, fruity and crisp with just the right acidic bite. Nor were they atypical. Many dry Bordeaux whites are just as attractive.</p>
        <p>While a few of the best Bordeaux whites come from the Medoc -- Lynch-Bages and Chateau Margaux's Pavillon Blanc are the best known -- most come from the Graves area south of the city, where, once, more white wine was made than red.</p>
        <p>The Graves region includes the Pessac-Leognan appellation. Some of the most famous properties, including Haut-Brion, are in Pessac-Leognan. Haut-Brion white has always been considered the finest in the Graves region, but few people have ever tasted it. It is rare and expensive. Haut-Brion's manager and winemaker, Jean Delmas, normally produces only about 800 cases a year.</p>
        <p>In the past, the dry white wines of the Graves had a reputation for being flabby, dull and slightly sweet. Would-be buyers who continue to reject white Bordeaux on those grounds might be surprised to discover how much the wines have changed in recent years.</p>
        <p>Contemporary white Bordeaux can be bright, clean, crisp and lively and can be matched with any foods that go well with chardonnay. Modern Bordeaux whites go especially well with seafood. Bordeaux is, after all, a great port, and the Bordelais are discerning seafood fans. The lighter, fresher style of so many Bordeaux whites owes much to the work of the oenologist Denis Dubourdieu, who also owns Clos Floridene in the Graves. Mr. Dubourdieu was among the first to ferment white wines in new oak barrels and to extend skin contact with the wines while they fermented. Today almost all the chateaus producing white wine in the Graves use methods devised by Mr. Dubourdieu.</p>
        <p>The critic Robert M. Parker Jr. observed: ''The old days of insipid, tasteless, technically correct but uninteresting dry white wines from Bordeaux have ended. Denis Dubourdieu is the man who profoundly changed white winemaking in this region.''</p>
        <p>The trouble is that Mr. Parker first expressed those sentiments more than a decade ago and that for some reason the powerful Bordeaux merchants have been slow to act on them. Probably because for the past two decades, they have been making so much money from their reds.</p>
        <p>Perhaps things can be changed by some of the newer arrivals in the Graves, like the Garcin family, owners of Haut-Bergey; their cousins the Cathiards, at Chateau Smith Haut-Lafitte, both at Pessac-Leognan; and Jean-Michel Cazes of Lynch-Bages, who owns Villa Bel Air at Saint-Morillon. All three producers make quality white wines, as well as reds, at these properties and are skilled promoters, as well.</p>
        <p>In Paris, Jean-Claude Vrinat sells oceans of Bordeaux -- red Bordeaux -- at his restaurant, Taillevent, and in his 60,000-bottle wine shop, Caves de Taillevent. When I asked him if he sold much white Bordeaux, he shrugged and shook his head. ''A few bottles,'' he said. ''It's sad. Parisians drink Bordeaux red and Burgundy white.''</p>
        <p>Talking about the decline in white Bordeaux, Mr. Aaron of Sherry-Lehmann said: ''I blame the restaurant  sommeliers. White Bordeaux can be magnificent, and most of it is reasonably priced. The wine stewards should be telling people about it. Once people get to try good white Bordeaux, they love it.'' Sherry-Lehmann sells Blanc de Lynch-Bages at $30.</p>
        <p>Anyone wishing to expand his or her knowledge of these intriguing white wines might consider looking into the wines mentioned above, of course, but there are many more, many in the $20 to $55 range. They include chateaus Carbonnieux, Fieuzal La Grave, La Louviere, Olivier, Pape-Clement, Rahoul and La Tour-Martillac.</p>
        <p>Many other lesser appellations in or near the Bordeaux region produce dry white wines, but few are outstanding. An exception is Bergerac, in the Dordogne, where the standard Bordeaux white grapes are ameliorated by local varieties like gros manseng and Ugni blanc, which is called trebbiano in Italy. Still, Bergerac will always be better known for Cyrano than for its white wine.</p>
