        <p>Standing at a school desk, wearing shiny high-heel boots, Stacey Martin, 17 years old, rapped her fist on the table, looked straight into the judge's eyes and spoke with the aplomb of a seasoned lawyer and the dizzying speed of an auctioneer.</p>
        <p>The words flowed in rapid-fire succession -- drug use, suspicion, probable cause -- but they were part of a coherent, well-researched argument. She and her teammate at a national-level tournament at the Bronx High School of Science last weekend were arguing in favor of the United States Coast Guard's participation in the war on drugs.</p>
        <p>High school debate teams like Ms. Martin's, which won several rounds before being eliminated last weekend, have long trained the nation's elite in critical thinking and public presentation. Although aides to Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who debated on national television last night, said the candidates had not been on their high school teams, many politicians and public speakers cut their oratorical teeth in high school tournaments.</p>
        <p>But in the early 1980's, as urban schools faced budget cuts, debate teams were one of the first casualties. By the 1990's, only four public schools in New York City had teams, and only two -- Stuyvesant and Bronx High School of Science -- competed in policy debate, the most rigorous form.</p>
        <p>But in New York and other big cities, debate is making a comeback, and its newest participants are coming from nontraditional quarters. With long hours of research and often prohibitive entry fees for competitions, debate was for many years a bastion of financially comfortable white males. But in New York City, debaters are as likely to be low-income, nonwhite and female. Ms. Martin, who was raised by a single mother after her father died, attends Franklin K. Lane High School, a largely black and Hispanic school in Woodhaven, Queens, where 43 percent of students receive free lunches and 39 percent graduate in four years.</p>
        <p>Franklin K. Lane, Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, Wadleigh Secondary School in Harlem, Ralph McKee Vocational High School in Staten Island and the High School for Legal Studies in Brooklyn are among 34 New York City public high schools that recently started debate teams. All are members of the Urban Debate League, a pilot program financed by George Soros's Open Society Institute to help introduce debate into inner-city public schools.</p>
        <p>The program, which is based on a similar one in Atlanta, started its first teams in New York City in 1997 and has since branched out to 12 cities. Of a $2 million annual budget, about $500,000 goes to New York schools.</p>
        <p>Coming in, the students knew little about debate. Some were lured by the prospect of travel; one freshman said he attended his first meeting after a scary-looking older student cornered him and ordered him to go. One attraction was the prospect of challenging top-level schools to do intellectual battle.</p>
        <p>''We went to New York and said, 'Before the year is out you will have beaten Bronx Science or Stuyvesant at least once,' '' said Melissa Maxcy Wade, who founded the original Atlanta league and is director of forensics at Emory University there.</p>
        <p>That happened the second semester. By the second year, an Urban Debate League school, Grace H. Dodge Vocational High School in the Bronx, was the junior varsity state champion. Last year, Franklin K. Lane High School came in third all around in the state, with the fourth and fifth positions also taken by Urban Debate League schools.</p>
        <p>''Once that happens, the self-esteem they get, you can't buy that in a store,'' Ms. Wade said. ''Because these kids are basically led to believe they cannot compete with those schools.''</p>
        <p>Urban Debate League debaters have also seen their grades rise and discipline problems fall. Many report an increased sense of confidence, an ease with the world beyond the neighborhoods they grew up in.</p>
        <p>''You get familiarized with what's going on in your society,'' said Daymean Lewis, 15, a member of Lane's junior varsity team. ''And you just get this tone in your voice, you feel more forceful, that you can do anything.'' Many league debaters say they would like to use their debate skills to become lawyers or teachers.</p>
        <p>For some, public speaking comes naturally. ''In the African-American tradition, oratory is taught in the church,'' Ms. Wade noted. ''You're supposed to be eloquent; your job is to be Martin Luther King.'' As a result, she said, ''kids can speak well, but they're content-light.'' So coaches focus on research skills as well as teaching the foreign language of argumentation.</p>
        <p>The league teaches the most difficult form of debate, policy debate, which draws on fields like history, politics, economics and science. Policy debaters nationwide focus on a different topic each year. This year it is privacy, with students tackling issues like Internet privacy and a favorite of the presidential candidates: racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Some students drop out, daunted by the hours of research and meticulous organization of evidence into wash-basin-size plastic tubs that have to be lugged to each tournament. But for those who stay, the payoffs are many. Socially, they say they are more confident, and many find themselves resolving personal conflicts through logic and argument rather than force.</p>
        <p>Debate helps with schoolwork, too. ''I've learned a lot of big words lately,'' said Julia Monegro, a Lane student who immigrated from the Dominican Republic 5 years ago and had failed two classes before she started debating. ''I got a 91 on my report card in English, and I'm not that good at it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wade credits the Internet with opening debate to less affluent students who can now do the needed research. ''Computers have been a profound way to level the playing field,'' she said. So have scholarships for intensive summer training programs, which can run $3,000 to $4,000 for a 3-week session.</p>
        <p>By senior year, many urban debaters are hotly pursued by universities. ''I have college coaches coming up to me, saying, 'Who's graduating?' '' said the Lane coach, Shawn Robertson, who is also an English teacher at the school. Noting that past students have gone on to Middlebury, Brandeis and State University of New York at Stony Brook, he said, ''It's a good feeling as a coach to know that your students are wanted.''</p>
        <p>It also feels good, he added, ''to see students go from concerns about their sneakers to concerns about 'Is this missile defense something we should do?' ''</p>
        <p>League debaters are not the only beneficiaries. When tournaments and camps throw together the affluent with less affluent, both sides learn, Ms. Wade said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin recalled students she met at a debate camp at Northwestern University last summer. ''They tried to do things that they thought we would like,'' she said. ''One girl, because I'm black, she thought I'd like rap. I said 'Blink 182's cool,' '' referring to a white alternative rock band, ''and she's like 'Oh my God, you like Blink 182?' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin's teammate, Patricia Socorro, said interactions with suburban students had opened her mind. ''The way I used to think about them and they used to think about me, once you get together, that's abolished,'' she said. ''At first I thought, 'they're so snotty.' But they weren't snotty, they were cool.''</p>
        <p>Rafael Bruno, 14, recently spent his first night away from home when local debaters' families in suburban Monticello, N.Y., played host to the team. ''I was scared,'' he admitted. ''There was nothing but forest around there.'' But after his host started asking him about how debate works, he said, he forgot his fears.</p>
        <p>''Debate is like a link to different places,'' he explained. ''Half my family didn't graduate high school. I don't want to take the easy way; I wanted to take the hard way.''</p>
