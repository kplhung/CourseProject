        <p>Brahms is about as standard as the standard repertory gets, yet programs devoted solely to his works come along infrequently enough that the all-Brahms concert by the Orchestra of St. Luke's at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening seemed unusual, if perhaps a bit quaint. The program notes revisited the feud between Brahms and Wagner -- a musical battle that now seems distant and almost incomprehensible compared with the more understandably passionate disputes between supporters of Minimalism and Serialism.</p>
        <p>But the performance was less about reviving ancient battles than about looking at Brahms afresh. On offer were the Third and Fourth Symphonies, with the Alto Rhapsody between them. And on the podium was Sir Charles Mackerras, the orchestra's music director, who has breathed life into everything from Handel and Mozart on modern instruments (with interpretive ideas drawn from early-music performers) to the operas of Janacek. Recently he turned his gaze on Brahms and recorded a remarkable traversal of the symphonies with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra on the Telarc label.</p>

        <p>Brahms is about as standard as the standard repertory gets, yet programs devoted solely to his works come along infrequently enough that the all-Brahms concert by the Orchestra of St. Luke's at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening seemed unusual, if perhaps a bit quaint. The program notes revisited the feud between Brahms and Wagner -- a musical battle that now seems distant and almost incomprehensible compared with the more understandably passionate disputes between supporters of Minimalism and Serialism.</p>
        <p>But the performance was less about reviving ancient battles than about looking at Brahms afresh. On offer were the Third and Fourth Symphonies, with the Alto Rhapsody between them. And on the podium was Sir Charles Mackerras, the orchestra's music director, who has breathed life into everything from Handel and Mozart on modern instruments (with interpretive ideas drawn from early-music performers) to the operas of Janacek. Recently he turned his gaze on Brahms and recorded a remarkable traversal of the symphonies with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra on the Telarc label.</p>
        <p>Both on the recordings and with the St. Luke's players on Wednesday, he reconfigured the textures, tempos and weights of these familiar works and presented the thesis that Brahms's music as we have come to know it -- from performances by full-size symphony orchestras -- is bloated and ponderous. So ingrained are those readings that the concept of the Brahms Fourth played by a chamber orchestra seems ludicrous.</p>
        <p>Yet with brisk tempos, fluid dynamics and a flair for dramatic phrasing, as well as the help of a hefty foundation provided by five double basses (more than usual for a chamber orchestra), the point was made. There was no diminution of grandeur in either symphony: the orchestra thundered through the opening of the Third and the finale of the Fourth.</p>
        <p>Nor did thinning out the violins, violas and cellos exact a cost in lyricism. These performances were sharply accented and had a lovely lilt. And apart from fleeting technical problems -- wayward intonation in the winds and a strident violin sound in the first movement of the Fourth -- the sound the orchestra produced was warm, rich-hued and invigorating.</p>
        <p>In the Alto Rhapsody, Jennifer Larmore's mezzo-soprano had a contraltolike timbre and gave the Goethe text the weight it demands, with firm support from the orchestra and the New York Concert Singers.</p>
