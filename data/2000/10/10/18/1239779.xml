        <p>Although Jon S. Corzine is shattering spending records in his New Jersey race for the United States Senate, most voters either do not know or do not care, a New York Times poll has found.</p>
        <p>In outspending his Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, by about 17 to 1, Mr. Corzine alone has captured the attention of a majority of voters. With three weeks remaining until Election Day, 59 percent of those who responded to the survey said they had no opinion of Mr. Franks. But despite intensive news coverage of Mr. Corzine's campaign finances -- he has poured about $53 million into his Senate bid so far -- he has not encountered widespread resentment from voters over his spending.</p>
        <p>The poll, which began last Thursday and was completed Sunday night, shows Mr. Corzine holds a considerable advantage over Mr. Franks but has yet to put the race away. Mr. Corzine leads by 12 points among likely voters, with 45 percent to Mr. Franks's 33 percent.</p>
        <p>But the survey also suggests this election could follow the New Jersey pattern of being decided at the last minute. One in five voters remains undecided, and, perhaps because most have found the race dull so far, 38 percent have been paying little or no attention until now -- twice as many as at the same point in the two most recent elections for governor.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Franks, who has husbanded his scarce resources until now, is to begin running TV commercials in both the New York and Philadelphia media markets today, his aides said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Franks may take little comfort from the survey's findings. His central strategy, to convince voters that Mr. Corzine is cynically trying to buy a Senate seat, has not had much effect, the survey found. Only 24 percent of voters were aware that Mr. Corzine was spending more than $1 million a week.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more important, every additional dollar Mr. Franks spends to attack Mr. Corzine for his campaign spending is largely wasted, according to the Times poll, and may even be counterproductive.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of voters say Mr. Corzine's spending makes no difference to them, and more view his spending as a necessity for Mr. Corzine, a political newcomer, than see it as an attempt to buy the election.</p>
        <p>''I feel if he has the money to spend, let him spend it,'' said Ethel Jackson, 71, a retired social worker from Atlantic City, who identified herself as a Democrat. ''There's no law against it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's arguments appeared persuasive to a smaller number of voters, including some independents and even fewer Democrats. When told Mr. Corzine was spending more than $1 million a week for his campaign, 37 percent then said they believed he was buying the election. Although 4 in 10 people who shared that view were Republicans, nearly 6 in 10 said they supported Mr. Franks.</p>
        <p>''I don't have a problem with candidates spending their own money, I just think it's unfair to Franks,'' said Scott Biri, a 45-year-old mechanical contractor from South Brunswick. An independent, he said he was intrigued by Mr. Corzine, but that his spending was problematic. ''Swamping me with advertising is not going to sway me either way.''</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Corzine, who has been alone in running positive, issue-oriented campaign commercials along with ads denigrating his opponent, is seen by 47 percent of voters as doing a better job of discussing the important issues in the campaign, compared with the 17 percent who said Mr. Franks was doing a better job.</p>
        <p>Similarly, although even Mr. Corzine's attack ads have outnumbered his opponent's, Mr. Corzine is seen as mainly explaining his own positions, while more people believe Mr. Franks is attacking rather than describing his views. In the same vein, more voters think Mr. Corzine cares about the needs and problems of people like them than think Mr. Franks does.</p>
        <p>Over all, the survey suggests Mr. Franks -- who has focused on Mr. Corzine's money, in one form or another, almost to the exclusion of any other issue -- may have difficulty gaining ground unless he changes tactics in the campaign's final three weeks.</p>
        <p>''It's still early, and we hope these numbers hold up through Election Day, but I think what it shows us is that Bob Franks is pursuing a dead-end strategy of attacking Jon Corzine on the money,'' said Tom Shea, Mr. Corzine's spokesman. ''There's a reason why 59 percent of the people in your poll don't know enough about Bob Franks. He hasn't told them anything about himself.''</p>
        <p>Strikingly, while Mr. Franks, a four-term congressman and lifelong politician, is viewed by 56 percent of voters as having the right kind of experience to be New Jersey's senator, Mr. Corzine, whose last run for office was in an election for the University of Illinois student senate, does not trail appreciably in this regard: 49 percent of voters say Mr. Corzine has the experience needed for the job.</p>
        <p>The Times telephone poll was conducted with 1,158 residents of New Jersey, of whom 908 said they were registered to vote. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>When undecided voters were asked to say which way they were leaning, and their probable votes were added to the totals, Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, broke the crucial 50 percent barrier, leading Mr. Franks 53 percent to 37 percent.</p>
        <p>The survey also found a pronounced gender gap in the Senate race: men were evenly divided between the two candidates, with 41 percent favoring Mr. Corzine and 40 percent favoring Mr. Franks, but among women, 49 percent favored Mr. Corzine, while only 27 percent supported Mr. Franks.</p>
        <p>The survey found that Mr. Franks could benefit greatly from a low voter turnout. When the sample was reduced to those voters who said they definitely planned to vote, had been paying attention to the Senate campaign, and had voted in either the 1996 presidential election or the 1997 gubernatorial election, Mr. Corzine's lead dwindled to just eight points, with 45 percent to Mr. Franks's 37 percent.</p>
        <p>Charlie Smith, the Franks campaign manager, seized on that smaller gap as evidence that Mr. Corzine's lead was not insurmountable despite what he called ''Jon Corzine's $50 million free ride.''</p>
        <p>''We are now up in both media markets for the duration of the campaign,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Our direct-mail program has started. For three weeks we intend to work hard to introduce Bob Franks to those 59 percent who are still waiting to hear from him or have yet to form an opinion of him. And we're confident, with three weeks, as people turn their attention to this election, to the choice before them, that we'll overcome this eight-point gap on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>But if turnout is higher than expected, it could swell Mr. Corzine's lead. Because the survey was adjusted to reflect turnout patterns in past presidential elections, it expects lower turnouts in Hudson and Essex Counties than elsewhere in the state. But Mr. Corzine, who hired an army of canvassers and drivers to pull voters from inner-city neighborhoods, produced enormous turnouts in those counties in the Democratic primary. That effort to get out the vote cost Mr. Corzine several million dollars, and he is expected to repeat it in November.</p>
        <p>In the presidential race, the Times poll showed Vice President Al Gore leading Gov. George W. Bush of Texas by 15 points, with 49 percent to Mr. Bush's 34 percent. Ralph Nader was supported by 8 percent of New Jersey voters, and Patrick J. Buchanan was favored by 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The poll's findings were in keeping with several years of statewide surveys by The Times and by the Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll that indicate New Jersey is evolving from partisan parity into more and more of a Democratic state. In October 1997, 33 percent of respondents to a Times/CBS News poll said they considered themselves Democrats, and 30 percent called themselves Republicans. The latest survey shows Democrats with a lopsided edge of 39 percent to 23 percent. The number of independents has remained constant at 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Asked to name the single most important issue in deciding how to vote in the Senate race, 15 percent of voters said education, and 13 percent said taxes. Health care was named by 6 percent of voters, and Medicare by 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Corzine and Mr. Franks had met in two debates that were televised before the survey began, few people had watched. Only 16 percent said they had seen one of the debates.</p>
        <p>The two candidates have met since then in a third TV debate and one on statewide radio, and they will appear in a fourth TV debate on Sunday on WABC in New York and WPVI in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>If the Senate campaign has failed to grab most people's attention -- 56 percent called the race ''dull'' -- some respondents said the New Jersey contest suffered by comparison to the one taking place across the Hudson.</p>
        <p>''It's dull compared to Lazio and Hillary Clinton,'' said Mike Byrnes, 34, of Lyndhurst, who works for an insurance company, referring to the New York Senate race between the first lady and Representative Rick A. Lazio. ''The New York race has two people who don't seem to be afraid to take the gloves off. It certainly gets more coverage.''</p>
        <p>How the Senate Poll Was Conducted</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times poll of New Jersey is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 12 through 15 with 1,158 adults throughout the state. Of those, 908 said they were registered to vote.</p>
        <p>The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges across the state. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, a process that permitted access to listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex and age.</p>
        <p>In addition, the questions about voting preferences in the 2000 election for United States Senate are based on the responses of ''likely voters,'' defined as a probable electorate in terms of intention to vote, interest in the campaign and past voting behavior.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New Jersey. For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.</p>
