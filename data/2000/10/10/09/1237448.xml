        <p>Anthony Tommasini reviews performances by Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky, with Orchestra of St Luke's conducted by Mark Elder at Avery Fisher Hall, opening concert of Lincoln Center's Great Performances series; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Gala concerts to open a season tend to be lightweight affairs, much like the first half of Wednesday night's concert at Avery Fisher Hall, which inaugurated Lincoln Center's ''Great Performers'' series, broadcast live on public television and radio. Two glamorous opera stars, the soprano Renee Fleming and the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's conducted by Mark Elder, sang some chestnut arias and favorite duets.</p>
        <p>But for the second half of the program, all involved took a chance with something more challenging. Several arias and extended scenes from Tchaikovsky's opera ''Eugene Onegin'' were performed as part of a new dramatic scenario by the playwright Albert Innaurato. The easy choice would have been for Mr. Innaurato simply to provide connecting narrative to place the musical excerpts in context. Instead his scenario is conceived as the wistful recollections of Tatiana, the young heroine of the opera and the poetic novel by Pushkin that inspired it. As portrayed with understated poignancy by the actress Frances Sternhagen, the old, tragically wiser Tatiana recalls her privileged and impressionable adolescence and that fateful day when her sister's fiance arrived at the house with a handsome, sullen stranger, Onegin, and Tatiana developed a helpless crush on him.</p>

        <p>Gala concerts to open a season tend to be lightweight affairs, much like the first half of Wednesday night's concert at Avery Fisher Hall, which inaugurated Lincoln Center's ''Great Performers'' series, broadcast live on public television and radio. Two glamorous opera stars, the soprano Renee Fleming and the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's conducted by Mark Elder, sang some chestnut arias and favorite duets.</p>
        <p>But for the second half of the program, all involved took a chance with something more challenging. Several arias and extended scenes from Tchaikovsky's opera ''Eugene Onegin'' were performed as part of a new dramatic scenario by the playwright Albert Innaurato. The easy choice would have been for Mr. Innaurato simply to provide connecting narrative to place the musical excerpts in context. Instead his scenario is conceived as the wistful recollections of Tatiana, the young heroine of the opera and the poetic novel by Pushkin that inspired it. As portrayed with understated poignancy by the actress Frances Sternhagen, the old, tragically wiser Tatiana recalls her privileged and impressionable adolescence and that fateful day when her sister's fiance arrived at the house with a handsome, sullen stranger, Onegin, and Tatiana developed a helpless crush on him.</p>
        <p>This bold concept had potential pitfalls. Pushkin's novel is written in rhymed verse, and Mr. Innaurato's attempt to evoke the style in English poetic couplets could have seemed stilted. And the familiar device of the flashback is always risky.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Innaurato's verse was simple and elegant, and the scenario, as staged with minimal props by the director, Frank Corsaro, worked effectively. It was like experiencing the entire opera compressed into an intensified 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>With his dashing stage presence and dusky, plaintive voice, Mr. Hvorostovsky was born to sing the role of Onegin. Ms. Fleming has sung Tatiana in two staged productions, the most recent with the San Diego Opera in 1994. New Yorkers can only hope she will sing the role at the Metropolitan Opera someday. The Russian language brings out an earthy quality in her sumptuous voice. And she tore into the music emotionally, fully capturing Tatiana's volatility and anguish.</p>
        <p>The program of chestnut arias in the first half, including the duets from ''Don Giovanni'' (''La ci darem la mano'') and Lehar's ''Merry Widow,'' was perfectly enjoyable. Though Ms. Fleming sang admirably in Puccini's ''O Mio Bambino Caro'' and Gounod's ''Jewel Song,'' she sounded vocally tired, which should not have been surprising: two nights earlier she had sung Donna Anna in the Met's production of ''Don Giovanni.'' Mr. Hvorostovsky was especially strong in Don Carlos's soliloquy from Verdi's ''Ernani.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Elder conducted throughout with stylistic insight and technical finesse. The Orchestra of St. Luke's must have worked hard at Glinka's joyous ''Russlan and Ludmila'' overture. Such incisive execution of the scurrying theme in the violins does not come easily.</p>
