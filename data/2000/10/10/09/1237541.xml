        <p>There is no pending legislation that would levy a tax on e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>But neither New York Senate candidate seemed aware of that yesterday in their debate as they were asked by the moderator, Marcia Kramer of WCBS-TV, what they thought of ''federal bill 602-P.'' The bill has become a sort of urban myth, with Internet users telling one another that Congress is considering a 5-cent surcharge on e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>At first, Mrs. Clinton said she had no idea what the bill was about, and then when it was described by Ms. Kramer, said: ''You know, based on your description, Marcia, I wouldn't vote for that bill. It sounds burdensome and not justifiable to me. I have been a supporter of the moratorium on taxation on the Internet. I think that we do have to let loose this extraordinary communication device and see how far it can go in connecting people up. And I'd like to monitor this closely and take a look at it in the time when the moratorium expires.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who is serving his eighth year in the House, said: ''I am absolutely opposed to this. This is an example of the government's greedy hand and trying to take money from taxpayers that frankly it has no right to. We need to keep the government's hands off the Internet. The industry has the capacity for creating more jobs, more high-paying jobs for New Yorkers than any other potential sector in the future. That's why I have voted for a moratorium on taxes on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>The moratorium they referred to is real, approved by the House in May and pending in the Senate. The bill, H.R. 3709, extends a moratorium due to expire in October 2001 that forbids states from seeking new ways of taxing Internet use, like imposing taxes on monthly access charges for Internet service providers.</p>
        <p>The House, seeking to put to rest the rumors of an e-mail tax -- which had swirled on the Web and required a denial by the United States Postal Service as long ago as  May 1999 -- also passed a bill in May to prohibit federal fees on Internet access. The bill, H.R. 1291, would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from imposing a per-minute access fee on Internet use, like that imposed on long-distance telephone calls. The bill is pending in the Senate.</p>
        <p>During the debate both campaigns sent reporters a flurry of e-mails labeled ''Truth'' (Mr. Lazio) and ''Reality Check'' (Mrs. Clinton) to rebut comments from the other side. But campaign workers apparently overlooked the veracity of 602-P.</p>
        <p>WCBS-TV officials said the question was one of several hundred the station received in response to an invitation to viewers to send questions by e-mail for the debate.</p>
        <p>''The debate's moderator, Marcia Kramer, was not aware that there is no such bill,'' said a statement released by the station. Ms. Kramer did not return a message left on her office voice mail.</p>
        <p>For months, a chain of e-mail messages has circulated asserting that a ''Congressman Schnell'' has introduced legislation that would impose a 5-cent surcharge on each e-mail message over the Internet. The money would be collected by Internet service providers and turned over to the Postal Service.</p>
        <p>The Postal Service's statements denying any such plans include: ''The U.S. Postal Service has no authority to surcharge e-mail messages sent over the Internet, nor would it support such legislation.''</p>
        <p>And there is no Congressman Schnell.</p>
        <p>The fictitious nature of ''602-P'' was pointed out by members of Congress after the debate (for one thing, all federal legislation begins with specific letters - ''H.R.'' for House of Representatives, or ''S'' for Senate.) Both Representative Anthony D. Weiner of Brooklyn, a Democrat, and Representative Sue Kelly, a Republican who represents the Hudson Valley, said they knew of the hoax.</p>
        <p>Democrats said Mr. Lazio, as a sitting member of Congress, should have taken an opportunity to point out a hoax that is, Mr. Weiner said, the subject of ''hundreds of e-mails to House members.'' The Democrats said his failure to note it was a fictitious bill was evidence of what they consider his neglect of Congressional duties, including missing scores of House votes to campaign. (Mr. Lazio has said he would vote on what he considers significant legislation, but has been spending time campaigning in New York.)</p>
        <p>Did Mr. Lazio know the basis of the question was a false bill?</p>
        <p>Mike Murphy, Mr. Lazio's chief strategist, suggested that was irrelevant in light of what he considered the more important issue of where the candidates stood on the potential for Internet taxation.</p>
        <p>''There are thousands and thousands of bills dropped in the hopper,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''The question was never, 'Have you ever heard of the bill?' She just mentioned it.'' He added, ''The key is where do you stand on the issue, and on Internet taxes, he is against it.''</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said he did not know if Mrs. Clinton was aware the bill cited was false and that, since she is not a member of Congress, she should not be expected to know solely from the number of the bill given.</p>
