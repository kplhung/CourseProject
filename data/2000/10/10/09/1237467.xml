        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>Last week I made my way home via the flower district, as I like to take advantage of end-of-day bargains there. As I was hesitating between Japanese lanterns and anemones, an elderly woman laboriously pushing a shopping cart stopped near me. She was holding a long-stemmed red rose. There was a questioning look in her eye as she turned toward the young clerk. He nodded to her, and she then took a beautiful bunch of red anemones, looked at me a little guiltily and went on her way. When I paid for my flowers, the clerk explained: ''I give her flowers whenever she passes by. It makes her smile.'' I headed home with a glow in my heart and a smile on my face, grateful to have seen that random act of kindness.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>

        <p>Ann Davidson Michell was at an Upper East Side movie theater one weekend afternoon when an elderly man, speaking with a pronounced Southern accent, questioned the ticket seller about the price of his grandson's ticket. ''Nine dollars and 50 cents for his ticket,'' he said in a voice that could be heard throughout the line. ''That's ridiculous! Why, when I was his age we used to see a cartoon, an installment of a serial, coming attractions and a double feature, all for 35 cents.''</p>
        <p>''Yes, sir,'' replied the ticket seller, a young woman about 18 years old, who smiled politely as she answered him. ''I'm sure that's true. But today we have sound.''</p>
        <p>ON SEEING TWO BUSES LUMBERING OFF TOGETHER INTO THE SUNSET</p>
        <p>Is it so that we may choose?</p>
        <p>Is that why buses come in twos?</p>
        <p>Whatever bus you see at random</p>
        <p>Always seems to be in tandem.</p>
        <p>With this, one would find nothing wrong</p>
        <p>Were it not for waiting twice as long.</p>
        <p>Neither snow nor hail nor sleet nor rain</p>
        <p>Can part the faithful constant twain.</p>
        <p>Let anxious commuters get older and colder,</p>
        <p>When the buses arrive, they are shoulder to shoulder</p>
        <p>As though each were a Siamese brother.</p>
        <p>You can't have one without the other.</p>
        <p>This close rapport 'twixt bus and bus</p>
        <p>Might begin to bore the rest of us</p>
        <p>Save when, to liven up our lives</p>
        <p>They come in threes or fours or fives.</p>
        <p>JENNA ORKIN</p>
        <p>A man who doesn't wish to be identified stopped a customer leaving a Midtown bank. ''Excuse me,'' he said. ''Do you have the time?'' No, said the man leaving the bank. ''I don't wear a watch.'' But as the first man turned away, he heard, ''Hold it!'' The second man then pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket and said: ''I have an A.T.M. receipt. I think they print the time. Yes, here it is. It was 7:52 about a minute ago.''</p>
        <p>There's-only-so-much-one-can-take department: One weekend afternoon, John Stratton was walking behind a young man who was pushing a stroller holding a wildly crying child. As the walk progressed, the crying got louder, and eventually the father and crying child entered the same building as Mr. Stratton on West End Avenue. By that time, the little boy was having a full-blown tantrum with ear-splitting screams. As they all got on the elevator, the operator asked what seemed to be the problem. ''Oh, he's only reminding me to never, ever, under any circumstances, have another kid,'' the father said.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>When I complained to a friend how I hated rainy days in New York because of the problems carrying an umbrella, she suggested I try no umbrella. Recently, on my way to my club, a light sprinkle started and I tried her suggestion. Instead of opening my umbrella, I marched on. The rain felt refreshing and exhilarating, and I soon found myself bursting into song.</p>
        <p>''I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain. What a wonderful feeling, I'm happy again,'' I sang. At first, as I strode up Amsterdam Avenue, people stared at me, but before long some joined in. Soon, there was a whole chorus of New Yorkers walking along, some who had put their umbrellas down and others with them still up, but all singing at the top of their lungs.  JUDITH C. KEILER</p>
        <p>FALL  A beckoning breeze  Seduces the quiet leaf  She's taken for a fall.</p>
        <p>CYNTHIA-MARIE PHILLIPS</p>
        <p>Joan Reid walked into a deli operated by a Pakistani man. She asked for some horseradish. The owner looked bewildered and shook his head. As she left, she heard his puzzled voice inquire of someone, ''What language is that?''</p>
        <p>Scene: A fine Chinese restaurant on the East Side of Midtown</p>
        <p>Time: Lunch</p>
        <p>Participants: Six business executives, including Len Corlin</p>
        <p>Action: None for about 10 minutes. Then water is delivered by a busboy. Time passes and no order for drinks is taken, and the maitre d'hotel and waiters are busy at other tables. Ten more minutes pass without service. Patience exhausted, one of the men in the ignored party lifts a glass of water and holds it over the aisle as though he is going to drop it. This attracts immediate attention. The maitre d'hotel appears instantly asking if he can be of help.</p>
        <p>Yes, says the host of the party. ''We would like to send out for Chinese food.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corlin reported that the service was impeccable from then on.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>In the wild, lions, tigers and other cats cover the food they are saving with soil. So what is an indoor New York City pussycat to do? Usually when they are finished eating, they scrape the kitchen floor in a futile attempt to hide any leftovers. But not our fastidious Fanny! This little 7-month-old Abyssinian cat neatly covers her dish with a napkin. We learned to leave a napkin near her ever since Fanny found one that had fallen on the floor and neatly pushed it over to use as a cover. And it's no accident -- she does it every time.
