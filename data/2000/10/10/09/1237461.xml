        <p>'West Wing' Posts 'ER'-Like Ratings  The two-hour season premiere of ''West Wing,'' the NBC series about an idealistic president, played by Martin Sheen, and his very earnest minions pulled in more than 25 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. That audience catapults ''West Wing'' up among the top programs in network television, into what is known as ''ER territory.'' [C13.]</p>
        <p>Revised Offer Is Seen for Exchange  OM Gruppen, the owner of the Stockholm stock exchange, is expected to revise its offer for the London Stock Exchange and may increase its bid, people close to the negotiations said. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Luxury Sites Revamp Credit Plans  Many Internet retailers have assumed that one of the quickest paths to profitability is to sell expensive goods: the higher the price, the higher the profit margin. Such simple math lured a swarm of luxury goods retailers onto the Web last year. But high-price goods have not been fast to catch on among Web shoppers. To eliminate barriers to completing a sale, merchants are offering extended payment plans during the checkout process. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Radio Expands Presence on Web  Many radio stations with loyal but small followings have in recent years expanded into Web broadcasting as a means of transcending their traditional geographic boundaries. And not only have they found a market hungry for their programming, but many have begun reaping financial benefits. [C13.]</p>
        <p>Time Gap Closed for News Releases  For decades, corporate news releases have been sent to the media 15 minutes before everyone else gets them, giving financial news agencies a monopoly on crucial information about earnings and mergers. But the 15-minute gap has ended. PR Newswire and Businesswire, the two services that distribute the vast majority of corporate news releases in the United States, are now sending those releases to Web sites at the same time they offer them to financial news organizations.

        <p>Investing With Islamic Law in Mind  IslamiQ.com, a financial services portal, seeks to guide Muslim investors who wish to manage their finances in accordance with Islamic principles. Dr. Hasnita Dato' Hashim, chief executive of the portal and one of the company's founders, said the company hoped to capture much of the Internet activity of an Islamic equity market it estimates at $150 billion. Staff members have screened more than 8,000 stocks listed on exchanges around the world to determine whether they are compliant with Islamic law. [C4.]</p>
        <p>G.M. Is Seen Bidding for Daewoo  General Motors has submitted a letter of intent to the former chairman of Daewoo's restructuring committee to buy Daewoo Motor of South Korea, the Financial Supervisory Commission said. G.M. would not confirm that the company had submitted a letter of intent to the commission, though. [C16.]</p>
