        <p>A solid, classical defense by Vladimir Kramnik held Garry Kasparov to a draw in Game 1 of their World Championship Chess Match in London yesterday.</p>
        <p>The 25-year-old challenger, who had been a protege of the 37-year-old Kasparov, and who only five years ago was a member of the champion's analysis team, set up a refined cordon that blocked the only invasion route that Kasparov had to try for a victory. It was a case of a Maginot Line that worked.</p>
        <p>So, after one game, the score is  1/2- 1/2. It takes 8 1/2 points to decide the contest, which will go a maximum of 16 games. The winner will receive the $1.33 million prize put up by Brain Games Network. The loser will get $666,666.</p>
        <p>Because of his apprenticeship with Kasparov, Kramnik is thought to have a greater insight into his thinking than any other grandmaster. Their prematch score against each other was a dead heat: 3 victories each, with 17 draws.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Kramnik rarely loses. This year he played 82 consecutive games without a defeat.</p>
        <p>Kramnik's 3 . . . Nf6 initiated the Berlin Defense to Kasparov's Ruy Lopez. After 4 O-O Ne4 5 d4 Nd6 6 Bc6 dc 7 de Nf5 8 Qd8 Kd8, an endgame is reached in which White has an advantage in space, with the e5 pawn as spearhead. In return, Black has a compact formation and the pair of  bishops.</p>
        <p>The only criticism of this defense is that there are other more flexible ways to compete. But this has no application in match play, in which  the usual strategy is for Black to be satisfied to draw and save his winning attempts for the games in which he is White.</p>
        <p>After 9 Nc3, it is usual for Black to play 9 . . . Ke8, but Kramnik's 9 . . .  Bd7, to bring his king ultimately to b7, is a reasonable alternative.</p>
        <p>Kasparov's repositioning of his king knight with 15 Ne1 and 16 Nd3 freed his f pawn for an advance, but it never succeeded in penetrating the enemy position.</p>
        <p>After 18 a4, the queenside was blocked, with Kasparov's three pawns nullifying Kramnik's four. This meant that if Kasparov could clear the board of all the pieces, he would be able to produce a passed pawn on the king's wing and would win the king-and-pawn endgame.</p>
        <p>With 18 . . . h4, 21 . . . Rh5 and 25 . . . Nf5, Kramnik spun a light square web that prevented the thrust with f5 that Kasparov needed to break through on the kingside.</p>
        <p>If 26 Nf5 Bf5 27 Ng4 c6 28 Ne3 Be7 29 Nf5 Rf5, Kramnik's position would remain secure. The players agreed to a draw.</p>
