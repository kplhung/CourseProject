        <p>There is a fine line in bridge between ingenious deception and unethical trickery. For example, playing quickly may conceal that you have something to think about but is never improper. Conversely, playing slowly may be unethical: it can deceive an opponent into believing that there is something to think about when there is not.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal, from a Spingold match, was reported in Bridge Today Digest Online and illustrates the point. South made a tricky play very quickly, and the defense eventually erred, allowing him to score an ''impossible'' game. Should either or both of the defenders have seen through the plot? Consider this as you read on.</p>

        <p>There is a fine line in bridge between ingenious deception and unethical trickery. For example, playing quickly may conceal that you have something to think about but is never improper. Conversely, playing slowly may be unethical: it can deceive an opponent into believing that there is something to think about when there is not.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal, from a Spingold match, was reported in Bridge Today Digest Online and illustrates the point. South made a tricky play very quickly, and the defense eventually erred, allowing him to score an ''impossible'' game. Should either or both of the defenders have seen through the plot? Consider this as you read on.</p>
        <p>The declarer was Tommy Sanders of Nashville, Tenn., one of the country's top players. He bid strongly and found himself in an optimistic four-heart contract when his partner decided that his hand was better than it might have been.</p>
        <p>A trump lead would have been effective, but West chose to attack the unbid diamond suit. South summed up the situation rapidly, which was essential: slow thinking would have helped the defense considerably. He had seven sure tricks in the red suits and could certainly score a diamond ruff. He could hope for one club trick, but the 10th trick was going to be hard to find. Two diamond ruffs were not possible, since there was no quick re-entry to the closed hand and the defense would surely lead a trump at the earliest opportunity.</p>
        <p>After 10 seconds for thought, South played low from dummy. When the king appeared on his right, he followed low without hesitation. (If he had hesitated, both defenders would have known where the ace was, since hesitation without the ace would be improper.) East shifted to a trump, and South won and ruffed a diamond. He led a spade, West winning with the nine. Eager to cash diamond tricks, West confidently continued that suit, sure that his partner held the ace. He was deflated when South won with the jack, drew the remaining trumps, and made a winning guess in clubs to make his game.</p>
        <p>Should the defense have solved the problem? West could have reasoned that if his partner held the diamond ace, South must have the club ace. And holding that card South would not have led a spade from the dummy. He would surely have crossed to the club ace, drawn trumps and tried the club finesse.</p>
        <p>But East should have saved his partner. He knew that South held the diamond ace, for West would not have underled that card at the first trick. And West's failure to lead spades suggested an ace-queen holding. So when South led a spade from dummy at the fourth trick, East should have risen alertly with the spade king. Then he could have led a diamond, preventing his partner from making a disastrous error.</p>
