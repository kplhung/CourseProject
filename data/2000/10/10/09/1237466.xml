        <p>Representative J. Dennis Hastert was elected speaker by his Republican colleagues last year for one reason: He was the opposite of Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>Where Mr. Gingrich was fiery and combative, blamed for going so far as to shut down the government rather than concede to President Clinton, aides say Mr. Hastert is subdued and devoid of ego, a conciliator who works diligently behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>Never have the men's opposing styles of leadership been more evident than now, a month before Election Day, when Mr. Hastert must go head-to-head with the president in  year-end budget negotiations.</p>
        <p>With control of the House at stake, Mr. Hastert is more willing than his predecessor to broker agreements with the president without betraying rank-and-file Republicans, a delicate balancing act. It is an approach that brings out the natural dealmaker in Mr. Clinton, a president who is always eager to split the difference and hash out policy details.</p>
        <p>Their dynamic harks back to a political era before Mr. Gingrich, when presidents and speakers from opposing parties -- like President Reagan and Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. -- cajoled and disagreed, all without personal animosity.</p>
        <p>''I think we've had a pretty honest, open relationship with each other,'' Mr. Hastert said in an interview. ''I'm not here as a person who tries to play games and set traps. I've always told him I'm not going to try to blow smoke at him, and I'll be a straight shooter.''</p>
        <p>At a time when profound partisanship still dominates Capitol Hill, their bond -- one built on mutual trust -- has led to several successful legislative partnerships, from fighting drugs in Colombia to combating poverty in America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert spoke for about 20 minutes one day last week on a range of subjects as different as spending bills and breast cancer research, aides said.</p>
        <p>The two men occasionally detour into chitchat about their Labrador retrievers or Mr. Clinton's collection of campaign buttons, but aides say Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert thrive on getting down to business. There is little gamesmanship. There are few existential tangents.</p>
        <p>''They can essentially level with each other about what they want or don't want, what they can or can't deliver,'' said the White House chief of staff, John D. Podesta. ''They are not buddy-buddy, but they have a kind of solid relationship of trying to work to get some stuff done.''</p>
        <p>This solid relationship is often tested by election-year politics. Mr. Clinton must consider the needs of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Mr. Hastert, who seldom speaks with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, must nevertheless be sensitive to his standing in the polls. Mr. Bush's success or failure could play a pivotal role in whether Republicans keep control of the House.</p>
        <p>In fact, the president and the speaker disagree on many things. When gas prices jumped in the Midwest, Mr. Hastert said the Clinton administration lacked an energy policy. They have also traded sharp words publicly on Republican tax cuts that Mr. Clinton has vetoed.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Hastert's efforts to find common ground with Mr. Clinton, Congressional Democrats say the process does not work that way on the Hill, where they say Republicans have abandoned bipartisanship on major issues like the importing of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hastert's collegial relationship with Mr. Clinton is in stark contrast to the open acrimony that prevailed on Capitol Hill under Mr. Gingrich, particularly during the impeachment.</p>
        <p>And while House Republicans have not necessarily lost their contempt for Mr. Clinton, they recognize that they must work with him or risk being portrayed as unable to govern. Such a conciliatory approach is made more palatable by Mr. Hastert, who has won over conservatives and moderates by including them in decisions. This tactic has earned the speaker the good will of his colleagues and made it easier for him to govern with a seven-vote majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert first dealt with the White House in 1993 on Mr. Clinton's ill-fated health care plan, when House Republicans were still in the minority. But it was not until Mr. Hastert became speaker in January 1999 that he began working with Mr. Clinton regularly.</p>
        <p>From the start, Mr. Hastert took a less combative tack, in part because of his longtime ties to Mr. Podesta, a friend since their paths crossed in college.</p>
        <p>The first challenge came within months, when Mr. Hastert backed a Democratic resolution in the House to give symbolic support to Mr. Clinton's air campaign in Kosovo. Even though the measure failed in a tie vote, Mr. Podesta said that the speaker took a ''constructive role, a nonpartisan role.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert recalled telling Mr. Clinton: ''We'll work with you on the Kosovo thing. We do have a responsibility in Congress to pay for these things. We don't want to be surprised. We'll work with you, but don't take us for granted.''</p>
        <p>By fall, the president and the speaker were working closely on a bipartisan plan to encourage investment in cities and rural towns with high unemployment rates. In an unusual display of comity, the two met on the south side of Chicago, a short drive from Mr. Hastert's district, to promote the plan.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the annual fall showdown over the budget approached. House conservatives were clamoring for Mr. Hastert not to yield on protecting the Social Security surplus. And he stood firm, telling the president that was one line he could not cross. ''I'm just telling you the facts,'' Mr. Hastert said he told Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>This impressed conservatives, including Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, who had felt betrayed by Mr. Gingrich's penchant for cutting deals with Mr. Clinton without consulting them, Republicans say. The one bit of advice they have given Mr. Hastert is ''trust but verify,'' said Representative John Shadegg, an Arizona Republican who is a leading House conservative.</p>
        <p>In June, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert championed a bill to send $1.3 billion to help train and equip Colombian Army and police forces to fight drug traffickers. The two flew to Colombia to deliver the aid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert's opening move in this year's contentious year-end budget battle was so conciliatory it unsettled even some of his strongest allies, including Mr. DeLay. Mr. Hastert offered to compromise on a deal to increase the minimum hourly wage by $1 to $6.15 in exchange for tax breaks for small businesses. Both sides are optimistic they can reach a deal. In the end, Mr. DeLay resigned himself to the trade-off.</p>
        <p>What has made for this more cooperative relationship is Mr. Hastert's plain, uncomplicated style. He is impervious to flattery, aides say, and his patience is legendary. Earlier this year he presided over a meeting on a health care bill from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.</p>
        <p>At the White House, currying favor with Mr. Gingrich was easy, officials and Republican aides said; one time, Mr. Gingrich arrived there to find a copy of Time magazine with his picture on the cover lying on a coffee table. ''If you want to get to Denny, you have to throw out Bass Master magazine,'' said one House Republican leadership aide.</p>
        <p>Bill Paxon, a former Republican congressman from New York who is now a lobbyist, said with a chuckle: ''I've been around the world with Denny, and I've seen him meet with potentates and princes. He is not a guy who is easily impressed. He's more impressed being out at an old car auction with someone who understands engines.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Clinton in the same room, conversations would often veer off into esoteric tangents and there was always an undercurrent of one-upmanship. The  fine details of legislation seemed too mundane, aides said.</p>
        <p>''Newt was much more a kind of theoretician,'' Mr. Podesta said in an interview. ''At the end of the day, even on stuff he knows he's going to have to give up, he will spend 20 minutes telling you why you are wrong asking for it. Hastert will say, 'I understand you need this, let's move on.' ''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Hastert is often dismissive of House Democratic leaders, he takes a much more hands-on approach in negotiations with the White House and is more pragmatic than Mr. Gingrich was, Republican aides said. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert meet privately about four times a year and speak on the telephone about the same number of times.</p>
        <p>Election-year forces may yet conspire to derail this collegiality. While there is some hope for a bill to overhaul managed care, aides say Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert are far apart on legislation to provide prescription drug coverage to the elderly and to make attacks on gays a federal hate crime.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Mr. Hastert speaks only for House Republicans. Senate Republicans, led by Trent Lott of Mississippi, feel less vulnerable this campaign season and less inclined to compromise. ''What Hastert wants and what he can deliver are two different things,'' Mr. Podesta said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert recognizes that the president faces his own pressures. Mr. Clinton tries to be a straight shooter ''as much as he can,'' the speaker said. ''He's pretty much laid things out on the table.''</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Hastert added, ''he has a party he must go back to in the Congress.''</p>
