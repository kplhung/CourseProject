        <p>Like many celebrity authors, Danielle Steel hates book tours. Indeed, she now refuses them all together. So, to promote the publication of her 50th romance novel, ''Journey,'' Random House's Delacorte Press is planning an unprecedented promotional stunt instead: giving away a million paperback copies of three previous novels, with no strings attached.</p>
        <p>''She does not like to do publicity, so we wanted to find a way that the books themselves can carry the weight,'' said Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of Random House's Bantam Dell publishing group. So the publisher arranged a special printing of one million copies of three of her previously published romances, ''Kaleidoscope,'' ''Fine Things'' and ''Family Album.'' On Oct. 17th, stacks of the copies will be available free at small bookstores, chains, drug stores, Wal-Mart Stores and anywhere else that her best-selling books are sold. (Except Barnes &amp; Noble, which declined the hassles of unpacking the free copies in the company's 800 stores.)</p>

        <p>Like many celebrity authors, Danielle Steel hates book tours. Indeed, she now refuses them all together. So, to promote the publication of her 50th romance novel, ''Journey,'' Random House's Delacorte Press is planning an unprecedented promotional stunt instead: giving away a million paperback copies of three previous novels, with no strings attached.</p>
        <p>''She does not like to do publicity, so we wanted to find a way that the books themselves can carry the weight,'' said Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of Random House's Bantam Dell publishing group. So the publisher arranged a special printing of one million copies of three of her previously published romances, ''Kaleidoscope,'' ''Fine Things'' and ''Family Album.'' On Oct. 17th, stacks of the copies will be available free at small bookstores, chains, drug stores, Wal-Mart Stores and anywhere else that her best-selling books are sold. (Except Barnes &amp; Noble, which declined the hassles of unpacking the free copies in the company's 800 stores.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Applebaum declined to comment on the cost. Publishers say rack-size paperbacks cost less than a dollar a copy to print, but shipping and distribution will probably raise the total price to close to $1 million.</p>
        <p>To commemorate her 50th book, Ms. Steel provided a note to her readers in each free book in her inimitable romantic style. ''I hope that this book will be one that you enjoy, and that it will open yet another door for you into a world of challenge, integrity and hope,'' she writes. In case readers missed any of the preceding 49 page-turners, the publisher provided a one paragraph summary of each in a catalog-like appendix, from ''Irresistible Forces'' to ''Going Home.''</p>
        <p>Lynn Goldberg, a prominent book publicist, called the giveaway a novel if pricey solution to the common problem of placating celebrity authors who no longer care for the hassles of promoting their books to new readers.</p>
        <p>''All the big authors are looking for the next gimmick,'' she said. One author recently approached her with a plan to give away a car, she said.</p>
