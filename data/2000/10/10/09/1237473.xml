        <p>THEY have raised record-breaking sums of cash to help their candidates. They have stayed unified, on message and unequivocal in their mission to win back the House. Even Republicans concede that.</p>
        <p>But House Democrats could face a snarl in their carefully drawn plans to take control of the House and make one of their own its speaker.</p>
        <p>''I'll vote for Hastert,'' said Representative James A. Traficant Jr., the renegade Democrat from Ohio, a man who has had run-ins over the years with the F.B.I., federal prosecutors, the Internal Revenue Service, legions of hair stylists (including his wife), and now, Democratic leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Traficant's vow means that even if Democrats clinch a net gain of six seats on Election Day to regain a bare majority in the House, Mr. Traficant would still provide the winning vote to rename J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, as speaker.</p>
        <p>''He's very fair,'' Mr. Traficant said about Mr. Hastert. ''He doesn't come off with a lot of flash at times, but he's a real person.''</p>
        <p>He's also the person who helped Mr. Traficant deliver a swift kick in the knees to the I.R.S., by pushing through a provision in the tax reform bill of 1998 that hampered the agency's ability to seize a taxpayer's property. Mr. Traficant felt that the I.R.S. had too much power -- perhaps a grudge he held after the agency, in a civil procedure, found him liable in the 1980's for taxes on income that federal prosecutors had originally called bribes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Traficant, who was acquitted of the bribery charge before coming to Congress, calls his support for Mr. Hastert a matter of independence more than loyalty.</p>
        <p>''I came in here without really the control of the leadership, quite frankly, Scarlett,'' Mr. Traficant said (all his franklys are followed by Scarletts). ''I didn't come in with the idea of surrendering my voting card to anybody. I vote my conscience, and some people don't like my votes, and that's the way it goes.''</p>
        <p>In his view, Republicans haven't gotten the credit they deserve for ending welfare and balancing the budget. ''When people deserve credit, they should get it,'' said Mr. Traficant, who routinely votes with Republicans.</p>
        <p>What's more, he said, Democrats worked against him during his primary this year. He offered no proof but to say that organized labor did not endorse him.</p>
        <p>''I harbor no grudges,'' he said, adding in the same breath and using a vulgarity that he would get his revenge when the time is right. ''I mean, that's politics, you know. This isn't horseshoes.''</p>
        <p>THE fact is that Mr. Traficant -- his history, his love affair with flare-bottomed polyesters, the gray shock of hair that sprouts like a Chia Pet, and those one-minute speeches on the House floor that teeter between clever and eerie -- is markedly different from the average, nondescript Washington politician. His constituents, largely, love him.</p>
        <p>In March, Mr. Traficant stood up on the House floor and did something that most lawmakers wouldn't think of doing: He predicted that he would be indicted.</p>
        <p>For months now, he has been investigated on allegations by the Justice Department that he illegally accepted gifts from constituents. So far, there has been no indictment. That's not to say it won't happen, he says.</p>
        <p>In 1998, his top district aide pleaded guilty to federal perjury and racketeering charges that painted the aide as a ''bag man'' for organized crime figures.</p>
        <p>''They've been constantly on my heels,'' Mr. Traficant said. ''From the information I have, they are due to come with an indictment any time.''</p>
        <p>It would not be the first time the law came knocking.</p>
        <p>When he was a sheriff of Mahoning County, Ohio, in 1982, the F.B.I. accused him of taking bribes from mobsters in Youngstown, Ohio. They had him on tape, talking to Charlie ''the Crab'' Carrabia, saying, for example, that if Mr. Traficant's deputies ever betrayed him, they would ''come up swimming in the Mahoning River.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Traficant, who never went to law school, chose to defend himself.</p>
        <p>Dubbing himself ''my client'' in the courtroom, he told the jury he had masterminded a sting and double-crossed the mob. He was acquitted, and Youngstown, a blue-collar Rust Belt town, embraced him as a folk hero.</p>
        <p>One year later, in 1984, he was elected to Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Traficant was born and raised in Poland, Ohio. Notre Dame University tried to recruit him for its football team, when he was in high school, but the deal crumbled when the college coach was fired. Instead, he went to the University of Pittsburgh, where he became a star quarterback (and played with Mike Ditka, he said). Mr. Traficant, 59, and his wife, Patricia, have two grown daughters.</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Traficant holds special contempt for Attorney General Janet Reno, who ''committed treason,'' he said, for never appointing an independent counsel to investigate the Democratic fund-raising scandals.</p>
        <p>''Chinagate makes Watergate look like a jaywalking misdemeanor,'' he said. ''You have evidence of the Communist Party funneling cash to influence national politics in America, and there is no investigation. There is not even a hearing in a junior high school in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.''</p>
        <p>But back to the elections, and the Democrats' chance at seizing control of the House.</p>
        <p>''If it hinges on one vote,'' Mr. Traficant said, ''they better get me convicted because I will vote for Hastert. Period.''</p>
