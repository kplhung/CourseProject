        <p>A Nassau County police officer was arraigned yesterday on charges that he raped and sodomized a 30-year-old woman after pulling over the car she was a passenger in in North Woodmere on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The officer, Jay Seifert, 30, was on patrol around 4:45 a.m. Saturday when he stopped a car with two women in it on Peninsula Boulevard, the county police said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Officer Seifert asked the passenger to get out of the car and follow him to a nearby park, then sexually assaulted her, said Herbert Faust, the county's chief of detectives. Chief Faust said the driver witnessed the assault from her car.</p>
        <p>The women drove to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, where doctors determined that she had been raped, Chief Faust said.</p>
        <p>Officer Seifert, who worked at the Fourth Precinct in Hewlett, was arrested Saturday night and charged with first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy and official misconduct, the police said. He was suspended without pay pending an internal-affairs investigation, the police said.</p>
        <p>Officer Seifert joined the Nassau County police in June after nine years as a New York City officer. The New York department's public information office said yesterday that it could not provide information about him because it did not have access to his records on a Sunday.</p>
