        <p>A quiet credit squeeze is under way for the most heavily indebted corporate borrowers. Banks and other companies are increasingly wary of lending to start-up businesses, companies undertaking leveraged buyouts and other leveraged enterprises.

        <p>As the stock market gyrates and rumors are heard about Wall Street firms' incurring losses on high-yield bonds, investment worries are spreading to new markets.</p>
        <p>A quiet credit squeeze is under way for the most heavily indebted corporate borrowers. Banks and other companies are increasingly wary of lending to start-up businesses, companies undertaking leveraged buyouts and other leveraged enterprises. The volume of new loans to such companies, which typically carry bond ratings below investment grade, was 25 percent lower in the first nine months of this year than it was in the corresponding period a year earlier, according to S &amp; P/Portfolio Management Data, an affiliate of Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>''Only the best issuers are able to tap the market right now,'' said Sam DeRosa-Farag, director of global strategy for leveraged finance at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p>
        <p>A tighter loan market means that many of the small start-up companies that have fed the stock market's rise are finding it hard to obtain the credit they need to grow.</p>
        <p>The loan market, although it receives little publicity, is a critical source of financing for corporate borrowers of all stripes. Typically, one or two banks or Wall Street firms take the lead on making a large loan to a company. They then sell pieces of the loan to other firms, a process known as syndication. The riskier the company, the higher the interest rate.</p>
        <p>For many years, corporate loans simply stayed on lenders' books until they were repaid. But more recently, lenders have begun trading their holdings, and a relatively active secondary market for corporate loans has developed.</p>
        <p>In theory, corporate loans are among the most secure types of investments. The investors in loans have first claim on a company's assets should the company end up in bankruptcy. Next in line among creditors are bondholders, with stockholders having lower priority and assuming more risk.</p>
        <p>Start-up companies and deal makers undertaking leveraged buyouts rely on the high-yield-bond and loan markets to satisfy their hunger for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in financing. And with high-yield bonds in a slump, these would-be borrowers have increasingly depended on so-called leveraged loans.</p>
        <p>But buyers of such loans are increasingly wary of lending to marginal borrowers.</p>
        <p>What has many institutional lenders worried right now is the same fear that concerns the high-yield bond market: a rise in corporate defaults. For the 12-month period ending on Aug. 31, 3.87 percent of all high-yield debt was in default, up from 1 percent two years ago, according to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. With the increase in such defaults, the number of leveraged loans trading at distressed levels now accounts for 16 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>Last week, bankers were busy renegotiating loans for two companies, according to investors. A group seeking to acquire Johns Manville, the building materials manufacturer, in a $2.9 billion leveraged buyout was debating whether to invest more cash in the company after weak demand from banks.</p>
        <p>Another company, MainStream PCS, postponed efforts to raise more than $1 billion in loans last week, according to bank loan investors, due in part to their wariness about putting money into telecommunications start-ups. MainStream was raising money to finance the purchase of assets from Verizon Communications, Bell Atlantic's corporate successor. A spokesman for Manville declined to comment; a spokesman for MainStream could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>The week before, a third company, the car battery maker Exide, agreed to give its lenders warrants entitling them to purchase as much as 3 percent of its stock, in order to raise $250 million in bank loans it needed for an acquisition. That marked the first time a large corporate borrower was forced to issue stock to its lenders, according to Christopher Donnelly, a director with Portfolio Management Data.</p>
        <p>''This hasn't been the best period for the auto industry,'' said Bruce Ling, head of syndicated finance at Credit Suisse First Boston, which, together with Citigroup, took the lead on the Exide loan. In addition, Exide is in the midst of a corporate turnaround. ''We thought this was a creative way to market the deal to a broader investor base,'' Mr. Ling said.</p>
        <p>But to some investors, Exide's willingness to part with stock smacked of desperation. ''A deal that's selling well doesn't need an equity kicker,'' said David Millison, managing director of Caravelle Advisers, which manages a $2.1 billion investment portfolio that includes senior loans. Indeed, Citigroup and Credit Suisse have yet to sell a majority of the loan, according to investors in the loan market, suggesting some wariness on the part of other lenders. ''We are still in the process of selling the deal,'' Mr. Ling said.</p>
        <p>Banks that make leveraged loans are also facing pressure from the government to reduce their exposure to such lending. Last month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency completed a survey of bank underwriting practices. The report found that the problem loans on banks' books had doubled in the last two years, to $100 billion, or 5.1 percent of the value of all outstanding syndicated loans greater than $20 million.</p>
        <p>The good news for borrowers is that banks' role in the leveraged loan market has been shrinking for some time. Commercial banks long dominated the market. But securities firms have expanded their presence, and the wave of banking mergers over the last decade has caused the number of financial institutions participating in this market to dwindle. In the last few weeks alone, J. P. Morgan, Summit Bancorp and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette -- all participants in the leveraged loan market -- have announced plans to be acquired.</p>
        <p>As banks reduce their role in the leveraged loan market, private investors have stepped in. Investment funds now account for nearly half the buyers of leveraged loans, according to Portfolio Management Data. That compares with a share of 17 percent in 1994. These investors include mutual funds set up specifically to purchase loans, as well as pools of loans known as collateralized loan obligations that are then sold to insurance companies and the like. (There are also collateralized debt obligations, which invest in a combination of loans, high-yield debt and equities.)</p>
        <p>The growth of the mutual funds and collateralized funds helped the market for leveraged loans quadruple in size between 1993 and 1999, rising to $626 billion from $150 billion, according to Donaldson. That worked to the benefit of growing companies eager to borrow money.</p>
        <p>But there are signs that this new crop of lenders is even quicker than banks to cut back on lending when markets become wobbly. These nonbank lenders look at new loans with a much more critical eye than was customary in the old, clubby world of banking.</p>
        <p>''Banks will often provide credit for relationship reasons,'' Mr. Donnelly of Portfolio Management Data said. A company seeking a loan might also look to the bank for cash management services, or trading. ''What has developed is a large segment of the market that's immune to those kind of issues,'' Mr. Donnelly said. ''They have no bridges to burn.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Millison of Caravelle is a case in point. As the manager of a collateralized debt obligation fund, he is continuing to buy some new issues, but lately he has been spending more of his cash buying existing loans in the secondary market.</p>
        <p>''There is a flight to quality,'' he said. ''The loan market is still fairly robust. But with default rates on the rise, we're being very selective.''</p>
