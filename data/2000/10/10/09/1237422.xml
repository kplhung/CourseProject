        <p>After watching some of the political ads for the past few months, I can't help but wonder why candidates are spending so much money only to remake themselves into the spitting image of every other politician -- including their own opponents.</p>
        <p>When I worked as communications director in a gubernatorial campaign in 1986, I got to see how political commercials were made by some of the best in the business, using the best equipment. Since then, a revolution in video production technology has made it easier, cheaper and faster to produce commercials that are clever, visually provocative and, most important, different from any other. But beyond some occasionally flashier, animated graphics, the basic formula in this year's political ads seems to remain the same as it was back in 1986.</p>
        <p>You know the formula by heart: The slow-motion, soft-focus images of the candidate interacting with students in a classroom, talking with senior citizens, walking with construction workers, shaking hands with police officers. The sonorous voice-over announcer (occasionally a woman, but almost always a man and almost always one of a handful of identical-sounding voice talents). The generic canned songs that sound exactly like their Hallmark-card titles -- ''Scent of Victory,'' ''Call to Glory,'' ''Reach for the Sky,'' ''Gentle Winds,'' ''No Limits.'' On-screen graphics that are little more than bullet-point statements giving a shorthand version of the candidate's vague policy or his opposition's outrageous congressional votes, failures to vote or nefarious campaign contributors.</p>
        <p>These political spots begin life as words on a page. The announcers record rigorously poll-tested scripts.  The studio editors then use this audio track as the spine for the spot, laying on generically appropriate visuals: film, still photos or written graphics. It's not television, really, but polls with pictures. In an era when commercial marketers understand that every element of their presentations must emphasize the unique value of their brand, the message most of these ads send voters is that every  candidate falls within the same generic brand: politician.</p>
        <p>I'm not calling for flashier commercials. The right solution is simpler ads where candidates can express their personalities or viewpoints directly by speaking to the camera. I saw how well this could work when I worked with the media team on Harris Wofford's 1991 Senate campaign. Mr. Wofford, an unknown, 65-year-old first-time candidate, overcame a 44 percent deficit against Dick Thornburgh, the former Pennsylvania governor. In many ads Mr. Wofford spoke directly to the camera about ideas that truly were his own.</p>
        <p>Many political pros maintain that  the familiar ad formula doesn't become less effective from repetitive overuse. Why tamper with success? they ask. But at a time when ideology and party affiliation seem to matter less and less to an increasing number of swing voters, many of whom say they are simply looking for candidates they feel they can trust, human qualities that convey authenticity and character may be more persuasive than a nameless, faceless narrator insisting that a candidate ''is on our side'' and ''will stand up for us.'' After all, that's what they're supposed to do.</p>
