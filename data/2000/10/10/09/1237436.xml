        <p>The Internet may finally be living up to its potential as a truly global network.</p>
        <p>A case in point is IslamiQ.com, a financial services portal aimed at Muslim investors who wish to manage their finances in accordance with Islamic principles.</p>
        <p>The company, which began operations in Malaysia in 1999 and has its headquarters in London, held a luncheon in Manhattan last Wednesday to celebrate the opening of its New York office and sign a partnership with the database software company Sybase Inc.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hasnita Dato' Hashim, chief executive of IslamiQ (pronounced Islam I.Q.) and one of the company's founders, said the company hoped to capture much of the Internet activity of an Islamic equity market it estimates at $150 billion. Staff members have screened more than 8,000 equities listed on exchanges around the world to determine whether they are compliant with Islamic law, or Shariah.</p>
        <p>''You have to look at the activities of the companies involved,'' Dr. Hashim said. ''For example, a Muslim cannot invest in a company that is involved in the production of alcohol or the gaming industry.''</p>
        <p>Likewise, she said, ''interest is one of the key areas that is forbidden.'' So rather than paying investors in the form of interest, a compliant investment would be structured as ''more of a profit-sharing agreement,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In determining whether products are compliant with Islamic law, the site's 40 staff members are assisted by the company's Shariah board, whose members are Islamic scholars in Pakistan, Syria and Malaysia.</p>
        <p>So far, 40 percent of the site's users are in the United States and 20 percent are in Britain or Europe. Some 85 percent are men.</p>
        <p>Currently, IslamiQ primarily offers news and information, but plans to allow members to purchase stocks and other financial products once it has updated the site's technology through the Sybase partnership and secured the appropriate regulatory licenses.</p>
        <p>How soon will that happen? Dr. Hashim indicated there were no cultural strictures against operating at Internet speed.</p>
        <p>Gesturing toward the company's lawyers, she said, ''The faster, the better.''</p>
