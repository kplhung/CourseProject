        <p>Chuck Knoblauch was back in the Yankees' lineup for Game 5, as the designated hitter, but he has ensured that the controversy surrounding his benching and his uncertain future will remain an issue for weeks to come.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch met with Yankees Manager Joe Torre twice in the last 24 hours, once during the flight here, and Torre and he seemed to reach an understanding. Torre told Knoblauch he needs to take ground balls before games, which he had not been doing since his benching, and Knoblauch explained to Torre why the benching bothered him.</p>
        <p>But what Torre probably didn't know, as he made nice, is that Knoblauch had suggested in an interview with the Hartford Courant that he had played his last game with the Yankees. ''Why don't they replace me on the roster?'' Knoblauch was quoted as saying. ''They don't have anything for me to do. I'm not sticking around if they do, I'll tell you that.''</p>
        <p>As Knoblauch was being interviewed Saturday, the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner -- who intimated last month that Knoblauch was faking his elbow injury -- walked by without saying hello or acknowledging the second baseman. ''I'm as good as gone,'' Knoblauch said. ''I don't know what I did to Steinbrenner. When I was in Tampa, he was around all the time, asking me where I wanted to go out and he could make reservations for me. Now he doesn't even talk to me.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch refused to speak with reporters before tonight's 7-5 victory over Oakland, in which he went 2 for 5 with a run scored and a run batted in. It was his first start since Game 1. When asked about Knoblauch's comments, General Manager Brian Cashman said: ''I tend to believe it's emotion coming from a player who hasn't played in the last three days. It's the competitor in him.''</p>
