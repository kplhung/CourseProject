        <p>They look like real books. They have glossy covers, and convincing promotional blurbs.

        <p>They look like real books. They have glossy covers, and convincing promotional blurbs. Their titles sound like those of real consumer books: ''Al Gore: America in the Balance,'' ''Hillary Rodham Clinton: What Every American Should Know'' and ''Courting Disaster: How a Scalia-Thomas Supreme Court Would Endanger Our Rights and Freedoms.''</p>
        <p>But with some exceptions, these books are not available in bookstores. They are published by groups like the American Conservative Union, the People for the American Way Foundation, and the National Rifle Assocation -- and you will get them in the mail if you are considered an influential voter by the grass-roots political organizations that send them out, or if you happen to be a large donor.</p>
        <p>And for a number of reasons, there are more of these books rolling off the political vanity presses than in previous election years, according to scholars of the presidential races.</p>
        <p>Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, said the proliferation is a result of the tightness of races for the presidency, Senate and House and the huge sums of so-called soft money around.</p>
        <p>''It could well be that in an election this close, or so the polls tell us, anything can make a difference,'' he said. ''Close elections are very much the exception in American political life. And everyone has money coming out of their ears.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Coleman, a spokeswoman for People for the American Way, said that it was the importance of the issues that prompted the group's affiliated foundation to publish ''Courting Disaster.'' People for the American Way did not publish any books during the last presidential election, she said.</p>
        <p>''After Bush said last year that his idea of model Supreme Court justices were Scalia and Thomas, we got together a small herd of lawyers to research what that would really mean, so we could inform voters,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The grass-roots groups rarely profit from the books. The American Conservative Union, for example, raised $7 million to publish ''Hillary Rodham Clinton: What Every American Should Know,'' said Ian Walters, the communications director.</p>
        <p>''At the grass-roots level, it is easy for conservatives to order 12 books and then distribute them among their friends and families,'' he said. ''I know a lot of people who have called up and said, 'I know a lot of Democrats who need to be educated about Hillary Clinton. Let me buy 50 copies and hand them out at my Rotary Club meeting.' ''</p>
        <p>But the Democratic National Committee is trying to earn money from the book business. Lou Weisbach, the chairman of the Jefferson Trust, a group of the most generous donors to the Democratic Party, edited a book titled ''We the People,'' published by a group called Rare Air Media, and all the proceeds from the royalties on the book go directly to the D.N.C.</p>
