        <p>Gone were the postgame tirades and denials. The silence that permeated the Giants' locker room last Sunday was replaced by something more mysterious and intangible today.</p>
        <p>The feeling was everywhere, a realization that today could be repeated again and again this season.</p>
        <p>These are the Giants, a team whose 13-6 victory this afternoon over a hapless Atlanta Falcons team ended a two-game slide and accomplished little else.</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense, shattered last week by Tennessee, finally pressured a quarterback in its sixth game. Its four sacks were a season high and knocked quarterback Chris Chandler out of the game. The former Giant Danny Kanell replaced him but could not guide the Falcons to the end zone. And Atlanta produced just 13 yards rushing, its lowest total in team history.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offense is a more dire case. Nearly halfway through the season, there are more questions than optimism about a unit that was expected to make fans forget the dreary days of three-and-out.</p>
        <p>''Not good enough'' is how quarterback Kerry Collins described his performance. ''Not good enough in most weeks.''</p>
        <p>Victory was a necessity for this team after consecutive losses to powerful teams, by 16-6 to Washington and by 28-14 to Tennessee. Today the Giants improved their record to 4-2 and remain tied with the Washington Redskins atop the National Football Conference East.</p>
        <p>The players' reward was a day off on Monday, although Coach Jim Fassel said that had more to do with the team's late return to the metropolitan New York area tonight than a well-played victory. Even Fassel could not say that. Instead, he praised his team's third victory in four road games.</p>
        <p>But this was not a boastful team afterward.</p>
        <p>''We knew we were going through some adverse times,'' Tiki Barber said. ''We just didn't think it would be as tough as it's been.''</p>
        <p>Offensively, the Giants remain a mess. They not only failed to score in the second half, but they also barely entered Falcon territory. Their only complete series across midfield came after Jessie Armstead's interception put them at Atlanta's 38-yard line, and the Giants went three-and-out. Otherwise, they had one play over the 50-yard line.</p>
        <p>They converted just 1 of 12 third-down opportunities. Barber, the Giants' most explosive player, had 14 carries for 50 yards. His longest run was for 17 yards.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have enough spectacular plays, and that's what we're used to,'' Barber said.</p>
        <p>Collins's numbers looked pedestrian compared to what he flashed earlier this season. He completed 14 of 25 passes for 151 yards. But he was intercepted twice, both on deflections. Barber and Greg Comella, the running backs, were the Giants' leading receivers, combining for 9 receptions. Ike Hilliard had 2 catches for 25 yards. Amani Toomer, who had the ball go off his hands for an interception, caught 1 pass for 17 yards.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offense made things look easy during a 3-0 start. But it has struggled since its first drive against Chicago in Week 3.</p>
        <p>''The way things have turned out, it's certainly a lot harder than early on,'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>With an offense like that, the Giants had to rely on their defense. That burden plagued the team so much last season that it erupted into finger-pointing.</p>
        <p>Today they seemed thankful the defense stopped Kanell when it needed to. Kanell entered the game in the second quarter and completed just 15 of 36 passes for 166 yards.</p>
        <p>Still, Kanell had a chance to rally the Falcons (2-4). Starting at Atlanta's 26-yard line, Kanell drove his team to the Giants' 34. But he too made crucial mistakes, including wasting a play when he grounded the ball as the two-minute warning approached.</p>
        <p>On second-and-10, Kanell overthrew Shawn Jefferson in the left corner of the end zone, but cornerback Dave Thomas was called for a pass-interference penalty, putting Atlanta on the Giants' 10-yard line.</p>
        <p>After a Kanell pass went off the fingertips of  Terance Mathis, defensive end Michael Strahan sacked Kanell for a 7-yard loss. Defensive end Cedric Jones knocked down one pass and Jason Sehorn batted away another in the end zone, ending Atlanta's drive.</p>
        <p>''Defensively, I just didn't think they could score a touchdown,'' Strahan said. ''If they move the ball, let them kick a field goal.''</p>
        <p>The defense had already done harm. It sent Chandler stumbling to the sideline with bruised ribs following a succession of blows.</p>
        <p>The Giants' game plan was to apply pressure and hit the quarterback. ''Not just hits but hard hits,'' Armstead said.</p>
        <p>Shaun Williams applied several hard blows and Sehorn had a game reminiscent of his 1997 season.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to be physical today,'' Sehorn said. ''We wanted to get up in their face. We noticed in the last couple of games people that got up in their face have disrupted their passing game.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' opening score was fueled more by Atlanta mistakes than anything else. After the Giants failed to get past their 34-yard line, Atlanta's Winslow Oliver dropped the punt and Lyle West fell on the ball at the Falcons' 34-yard line. The Giants thought they ended that drive with a field goal, but unsportsmanlike contact by Atlanta tackle Travis Hall gave the Giants a first down. Ron Dayne ended the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run.</p>
        <p>The Giants led, 7-0, and had killed 11 minutes 40 seconds of the game before Atlanta ran a play. The Falcons marched to the Giants' 5-yard line, but Sehorn ended that drive with an interception in the end zone and a return to the Giants' 31. Nine plays later, Jaret Holmes's 34-yard field goal gave the Giants a 10-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Morten Andersen made a 42-yard field goal to pull Atlanta to 10-3 with 5:25 left in the half, but Andersen later missed a 45-yard attempt.  Holmes's 27-yard field goal as time expired gave the Giants a 13-3 halftime lead; Andersen added a third-quarter field goal.</p>
        <p>The Giants led, 13-6, late in the fourth quarter but Atlanta could not take advantage of their mistakes. After a Collins pass glanced off Dan Campbell and was intercepted by Ashley Ambrose, the Falcons could not manage a first down.</p>
