        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report on enthusiasm for the ''social norming'' approach to cut down on college drinking, in which colleges emphasize statistics indicating that most students drink in moderation (front page, Oct. 3). Yet few studies have evaluated this approach, and those that have are far from definitive. Almost all of the studies were done at single schools rather than at representative samples of colleges, and focused on how often students drink rather than on how much.</p>

        <p>You report on enthusiasm for the ''social norming'' approach to cut down on college drinking, in which colleges emphasize statistics indicating that most students drink in moderation (front page, Oct. 3). Yet few studies have evaluated this approach, and those that have are far from definitive.

        <p>College drinking requires our attention because too many students down enough alcohol to create problems -- vandalism, fights, injuries, driving while intoxicated and altercations with the police. Then there are the secondhand effects experienced by non-bingeing students, who are assaulted, whose property is vandalized, who are the victims of unwanted sexual advances or whose sleep and study time are interrupted. Playing down the problem is just another example of denial.</p>
