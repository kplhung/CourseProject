        <p>Until Wednesday night, NBC was not having a very nice fall.</p>
        <p>For the Sydney Olympics, the network received much lower ratings than it had promised advertisers. On Monday night, its first showing of ''Tucker,'' a new comedy, did poorly in the ratings. So did its airing of the first game of the American League playoffs, which many NBC stations carried on Tuesday night instead of the first presidential debate.</p>
        <p>But then ''West Wing'' made its season debut, and suddenly, things started to look brighter.</p>
        <p>The dramatic series about an idealistic president, played by Martin Sheen, and his very earnest minions was watched by nearly 13 million people a night in the last television season, making it the 27th ranked prime-time television show overall.</p>
        <p>But on Wednesday, a special two-hour edition of ''West Wing'' did far better, pulling in more than 25 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p>
        <p>That audience catapults ''West Wing'' up among the very top programs in all of network television, into what is known in the industry as ''ER territory.'' ''ER,'' NBC's hospital program, was the top-rated dramatic series in prime time last year, averaging 24.9 million viewers.</p>
        <p>Whether ''West Wing'' will stay up there is another matter. Not only had the premiere been heavily promoted throughout the summer and during the Olympics, but it also just won nine Emmy Awards, including one for best drama, which usually does a lot to help a program's ratings.</p>
        <p>Also, politics and the presidency is very much on the nation's mind right now, playing right into the program's premise. That could end after Election Day.</p>
        <p>Then again, it might not. Neither Al Gore nor George W. Bush is Martin Sheen. Nor does either of them have the actor Rob Lowe on his staff.</p>
