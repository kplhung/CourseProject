        <p>NOT to be too unkind to the Ivy League, which in varying degrees shaped all four men on the major national tickets, but you had to wonder about the value of a Yale education after listening to Gov. George E. Pataki carry on at the end of the second Lazio-Clinton face-off yesterday.</p>
        <p>The governor made an attempt at postdebate spin that was a good example of the modern politician in full ordinary-guy mode.</p>
        <p>He behaved like so many public figures, particularly men, who make it almost a point of pride to appear ignorant of anything that smacks of culture. We've strayed far from the era in which John F. Kennedy excited voters with his knowledge of literature and art. Now, many politicians are reluctant to acknowledge ever having so much as opened a book, for fear of being called elitist, as damning a word as exists in the current political lexicon.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just that Mr. Pataki, Yale Class of '67, professed yesterday to having never heard of E. B. White, who was only one of America's greatest essayists and literary stylists as well as the author of children's classics like ''Charlotte's Web'' and ''Stuart Little.''</p>
        <p>After all, we all have gaps in our general knowledge, sometimes glaring ones. Columnists are hardly an exception. And who knows? Maybe Mr. Pataki never gave his children a copy of ''Charlotte's Web.''</p>
        <p>The issue was the way the governor reveled in not recognizing White's name, or in at least claiming not to recognize it. Either way, he provided the most revealing moment on a day when the New York Senate candidates stuck like Velcro to scripted japes and ripostes.</p>
        <p>NEITHER Representative Rick A. Lazio nor Hillary Rodham Clinton landed a punch that could be called a haymaker. Nor did it seem that either made a paralyzing mistake. That task was left instead to Mr. Pataki in the post-debate spin sessions, which are used by each side to explain to waiting cameras and pencils why it won.</p>
        <p>E. B. White, who died in 1985 at age 86, had been mentioned by Mrs. Clinton when she and Mr. Lazio were asked during the debate to define a New Yorker.</p>
        <p>''Well, you know, E. B. White and others have done that over the years,'' said the first lady, who still struggles with a carpetbagger label that she cannot shake.</p>
        <p>A short while later, Mr. Pataki sneered at the reference as he proclaimed victory for his fellow Republican, Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio looks, sounds and talks like a New Yorker,'' he said. ''Mrs. Clinton quoted some guy, Wyatt or somebody -- I don't think he was from Brooklyn -- with some definition of a New Yorker that she must have read somewhere. I don't know who that guy was. I don't know what he wrote. I don't know where he was from. But it sure doesn't sound to me like that guy was a New Yorker or understood New York the way we do.''</p>
        <p>Listening to this assault on ''Wyatt,'' the supposed outlander, this columnist felt prouder than ever of his degree from the City College of New York. ''Governor,'' he asked, somewhat astonished, ''you've never heard of E. B. White?''</p>
        <p>''Where's he from?'' Mr. Pataki replied. When someone mentioned White's long years as a writer for The New Yorker, the governor said:</p>
        <p>''Well, I don't think the average -- maybe the average member of the media that lives in Manhattan when they're quoting New York would use E. B. White or whatever his name is. I don't think people from Brooklyn or Peekskill would have quoted that person.''</p>
        <p>The governor might care to know that Whatever His Name Is was born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., not from Mr. Pataki's hometown, Peekskill. Moreover, White's parents had moved to Mount Vernon from Brooklyn. Sounds like a New Yorker. And not a writer to be dismissed, certainly not by Mr. Lazio. ''He wrote 'Charlotte's Web,' '' the congressman said without missing a beat when asked if he knew the name. With a smile, he added, ''I won't tell you when I read it.''</p>
        <p>By the way, on the matter of defining a New Yorker, White wrote a book called ''Here Is New York'' some 50 years ago. ''There are roughly three New Yorks,'' he wrote, listing them as the city of those born here, the city that some commute to and the city of those born elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''Of these three trembling cities the greatest is the last -- the city of final destination, the city that is a goal,'' White wrote, adding: ''Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion.''</p>
        <p>Obviously, he had nothing as fleeting as a Senate race in mind when he wrote that.</p>
