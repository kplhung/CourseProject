        <p>As the lights dimmed in the Bowlus Fine Arts Center, five black-clad musicians of the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra took up their instruments. On the screen, the credits appeared for the 1924 Buster Keaton comedy ''Sherlock Jr.,'' and the audience settled down to treat the silent film with the respect accorded high art.</p>
        <p>The orchestra managed to make the music do the talking in Keaton's tale of a young man working in a movie house who dreams of becoming a detective. While trying to win his true love from an evil rival, he dreams himself right out of the projection booth one night and into the story on the screen in what was a technological coup for the era.</p>
        <p>At the end, the audience -- several hundred people dressed in everything from bib overalls or cutoffs to business attire -- clapped and cheered in this town of 6,400 people in southeastern Kansas. Film purists and comedy fans alike, some from as far as London and Los Angeles, they had gathered for the eighth annual Buster Keaton Celebration.</p>
        <p>The festival is timed to coincide with the anniversary of Keaton's birth on Oct. 4, 1895, in Piqua (pronounced PICK-way), seven miles west of Iola, while his parents were traveling with a medicine show.</p>
        <p>Keaton is ''a truly 20th-century American comic hero,'' said Frank M. Scheide, a film professor at the University of Arkansas and co-chairman of the celebration, emphasizing the word American. After starting in vaudeville with his parents when he was 3, Keaton got into movies at 22 when he signed to co-star with Fatty Arbuckle. He went on to create a body of comic silent-film masterpieces. With the arrival of sound, Keaton's career waned, but it revived in the 1950's, and he made many film, stage and television appearances until his death in 1966.</p>
        <p>Clyde W. Toland, an Iola lawyer who started the Keaton event, had never seen a Buster Keaton film back in 1991 when he heard a regional historian suggest that some kind of celebration ought to be held in Keaton's honor. The first was in 1993. Organizers like to call the event a celebration instead of a festival because it includes presentations by film historians and other experts as well as showings of films by Keaton and other performers of the silent era. ''Sherlock Jr.'' was restored by David H. Shepard, a former film professor who has put many old movies on DVD and video.</p>
        <p>A certain homegrown, family air surrounds some of the Keaton Celebration events, as when Keaton's granddaughter, Melissa Talmadge Cox of Cloverdale, Calif., stood on the lawn in front of the Bowlus Center showing a book of family photos to a couple from Topeka. And Keaton's cousin, Jeanne Keaton Holler of Jasper, Ind., presented a framed copy of an old article about him from The New York Times to Judy Westerman, curator of the one-room museum of Keaton memorabilia in the waterworks building in Piqua.</p>
        <p>And then there was Steve Allen, the comedian, musician and writer, urging a concerned schoolteacher from suburban Kansas City and the rest of the applauding audience to ''raise hell'' about ''the rudeness, violence, vulgarity and ugliness in comedy today.''</p>
        <p>Organizers said 792 people registered for at least part of the event this year, although those who attended both days were probably registered twice. They came from 61 towns in Kansas, 18 other states and Britain. Among the Kansans were Janiece and Terry Huntley from Muscotan, a community of a few hundred people in northeastern Kansas, who sat near the front for the two days. Mr. Huntley said that as a child in the early 50's he enjoyed seeing Buster Keaton on television and came here ''because we like to laugh.''</p>
        <p>Many of those on the program have also become regulars, including Patricia Eliot Tobias, president of the Damnfinos, an American-based Keaton society, and David Macleod, an announcer for Channel 4 in London and head of the Blinking Buzzards, a Keaton society in Britain.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tobias's group holds its annual meeting in Muskegon, Mich., the weekend after  Iola's celebration, and many hard-core Keatonites attend both events. Louise Langberg, who drove 10 hours from her home in St. Paul, planned to drive back there and fly to Michigan for the Damnfinos meeting. Calling Iola ''a great place to see obscure bits of film,'' she said she organized her vacation around the two gatherings each year. So does Mr. Macleod, who flies to Chicago from England, rents a car and spends two weeks driving around the Midwest, stopping in Iola, then Muskegon. This was his fourth visit.</p>
        <p>The yellow-brick Bowlus Center opened in 1964 as a first-class venue for performers -- from Count Basie and Marcel Marceau to the Alvin Ailey Repertory Company to the Vienna Boys Choir -- and as a place for Iola citizens and schoolchildren to perform and study fine arts.</p>
        <p>Mary Martin, the director of the Bowlus, which was built with money left by an Iola banker, Thomas W. Bowlus, says it was the catalyst for the creation of Iola's community theater and its orchestra. Over the years, three other families have set up trusts that help support the center and its programs. ''Those things only exist because the Bowlus Center is here,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The entire Keaton Celebration is accomplished on a budget of about $25,000, slightly more than $10,000 of which comes from the Kansas Humanities Council and $4,000 from  the city of Iola. The rest comes from private contributions and fund-raising efforts. Volunteers from Iola and Piqua provide support. The event is free, a condition of aid from the Kansas Humanities Council.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, when Mr. Toland turned to Ms. Martin and others to support a Keaton Celebration, she thought at first that it was ''the dumbest idea I had ever heard.''</p>
        <p>''I had no idea there were all these people out there involved with long-dead movie stars,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Ms. Martin, who is co-chairman of the event, threw herself into the project as Keaton became what she called ''our button to hang a vest on.''</p>
        <p>The first year, 1993, an old school friend directed Mr. Toland to John C. Tibbetts, a film professor at the University of Kansas, who put together a half-day program of three speakers, including himself. About 200 people showed up. The organizers also made a pilgrimage to Piqua and dedicated a marker. In the evening, everybody watched a showing of ''The General.''</p>
        <p>Things took off quickly after that. Mr. Toland's cousin, Kathleen Lax, a bankruptcy judge in Los Angeles, mentioned the Keaton Celebration to Ken Mars, an actor and comedian, who in turn mentioned it to his friend Jim Karen, an actor. Mr. Karen grew up idolizing Keaton and became a friend of Keaton and his wife, Eleanor, in the star's later years. He decided to come and to bring Mrs. Keaton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toland, meanwhile, sent notices to colleges in four states and carried brochures around in his car, dropping them off around Kansas and the region, including movie houses in Kansas City.</p>
        <p>That second year, the celebration was a full-day event, with Eleanor Keaton delighting the audience with a description of her husband's only return visit to Piqua. She said he had always assumed that tiny Piqua had simply disappeared, until one day in 1957 when they were whizzing along U.S. 54 on the way to the state fair at Topeka, where Keaton was to perform.</p>
        <p>Eleanor, who was driving, suddenly saw a railroad depot saying Piqua and slammed on the brakes, awakening her napping husband. They stopped, took photos at the depot, then drove off the highway a couple of blocks into town, reportedly spoke with a few people, then continued to Topeka.</p>
        <p>''By the third year, in 1995,'' said Mr. Toland, ''people began calling us and asking to be on our program.'' Mrs. Keaton, who died in 1998, returned, as did Mr. Karen, who has come back several times.</p>
        <p>Professor Scheide, an expert on film comedy, particularly the work of Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, first came in 1994 and has become a mainstay of the organizing committee. Now co-chairman with Ms. Martin, he brought the expertise and contacts for finding speakers that Iola's committed amateurs lacked.</p>
        <p>''He's almost adopted us,'' Ms. Martin said.</p>
        <p>Jeanne Keaton Holler and her brother, Ted Keaton, whose grandfather was a first cousin of Buster's father, attended in 1997. They have supplied original family photos and displays of postcards that Buster and his family sent to their grandparents.</p>
        <p>The year before last, two members of the Mont Alto orchestra drove to Iola from their base in Boulder, Colo., and volunteered to play for one of the movies. They were such a hit that all five members were invited back with the help of a grant from the Kansas Arts Commission.</p>
        <p>For this year's Keaton Celebration, the Mont Alto musicians produced a score to match the pace and mood of ''Sherlock Jr.,'' choosing from more than 5,000 pieces of music gathered from the silent film era.  Now, says Ms. Martin, they are ''part of the family.''</p>
