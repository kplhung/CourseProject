        <p>East Wareham, Mass., near the Cape Cod canal about an hour south of Boston, is not generally known as one of the telecommunications industry's hotbeds of competition. But do not tell that to Gary D. Powers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers is president of Abbey Glass, a small glass installer and distributor in East Wareham. His company, with nine employees and perhaps a half-dozen phones, is also a pioneer of what could be the most ambitious plan yet to give consumers and businesses across the country a choice in local communications providers.</p>
        <p>The vehicle for Abbey Glass's rush to the telecom vanguard is SBC Communications Inc., the giant local phone company known variously throughout the Midwest and Sun Belt as Ameritech, Pacific Bell and Southwestern Bell. This summer Abbey Glass became the first customer of SBC's new unit that plans to take on incumbent carriers in at least 30 markets outside its traditional region -- nine of them by year's end.</p>
        <p>Ever since the Bell local phone companies emerged from the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984, theirs has been a cozy club. With their mutually exclusive territories, they have reaped the fruits of their dominance as relatively friendly neighbors.</p>
        <p>Now, for the first time, that truce is breaking in a big way. SBC is invading the territories of BellSouth, Verizon (which includes what used to be Bell Atlantic and Nynex) and Qwest Communications (which includes what used to be U S West). In so doing, SBC hopes to siphon $1 billion in annual revenue from its Bell brethren within two years.</p>
        <p>For some people, the competition is long overdue. After the Telecommunications Act of 1996 relaxed many of the regulations that had bound the communications industry, regulators and consumer advocates hoped to see the benefits of competition. Instead, the local phone companies embarked on a binge of buyouts. In a few years, as the seven original Baby Bells dwindled to four, consolidation seemed to replace competition as the industry watchword.</p>
        <p>But more recently, regulators have made competition a condition for approving the biggest mergers. That is why SBC, which acquired Ameritech last year, is now under a Federal Communications Commission obligation to begin invading local markets outside its home territories.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Powers, among others, says bring it on.</p>
        <p>''When I heard about SBC from a friend of mine I said, 'Any new company in this business is good for competition,' '' Mr. Powers said. ''Auto glass is a highly, highly competitive business, and it's being consolidated every day by the larger worldwide companies. Any time that competition is injected into any industry it makes it better for the people using the product.''</p>
        <p>It was certainly convenient that Mr. Powers's friend was an SBC sales representative. But SBC, based in San Antonio, cannot rely on personal connections for all, or even most, of its sales as it enters new territory.</p>
        <p>And that raises the key question: is SBC serious? Will SBC's expansion strategy, which it says will include offers for both voice and data services to business customers and consumers, become the major force for competition that it certainly can? Or is this all a Potemkin village, meant to impress regulators?</p>
        <p>SBC officials say they mean business. ''We have set out to be a true communications partner for our customers, to really be a one-stop shop,'' said Ron Blake, president of the new SBC unit. ''We can't do everything at once but we want to be able to serve all of our customers' needs, and we certainly want to sign up a lot of them.''</p>
        <p>But suspicion may be natural because SBC's expansion initiative is being orchestrated under a deal with the government.</p>
        <p>On May 11, 1998, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman, stood up at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan, announced that his company had agreed to acquire Ameritech and almost immediately began talking about how the combined company would invade the territories of the other Bells under what has been called SBC's ''national-local'' plan.</p>
        <p>Certainly the plan, if done right, could provide a big new revenue opportunity for SBC; with essentially zero market share in the 30 target markets, the only direction to go is up. But ever cynical, many communications executives, analysts and journalists immediately suspected that Mr. Whitacre's appeal was directed more at the regulators who had to approve the deal than at customers. Having already acquired one of the other Bell companies, Pacific Telesis, SBC would surely have to make major concessions to push through the Ameritech deal.</p>
        <p>And lo, 13 months later, in June 1999, SBC announced an agreement with the F.C.C. under which the regulators would approve the takeover and SBC would go through with the national-local plan it had announced the previous year, among other conditions.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing new about the national-local plan except a guarantee that it will actually be performed,'' Bob Atkinson, the lead F.C.C. lawyer who negotiated the pact, said at the time.</p>
        <p>In a statement last week, William E. Kennard, the F.C.C. chairman, said: ''The purpose of the merger condition is to topple the status quo and further advance competition in local telecommunications markets. We look forward to seeing these companies providing customers with new services and lower prices in the near future.''</p>
        <p>Tomorrow is the deadline for SBC to certify to the F.C.C. that it has opened shop and signed up at least three customers -- of any type or size, business or residential -- in the first three of its new markets, Boston, Miami and Seattle, a target the company says it has already met.</p>
        <p>By the end of the year, SBC will also have entered Fort Lauderdale, Fla., New York, Washington, Baltimore, Atlanta and Philadelphia, in roughly that order. SBC plans to deploy communications switches and other equipment in at least 30 markets outside its region by 2002.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Whitacre bristles at the suggestion that this could all just be window-dressing wrapped around the Ameritech acquisition. ''That's really not the case,'' he said last week. ''We really did want to do this. The political side was really not ever part of it. I guess we didn't publicize all that much before, but it's something we've wanted to do for a long time. This is something we are very serious about.''</p>
        <p>It is tough to argue with that assessment after a visit to West 26th Street in Manhattan. There, on the ground floor of a cavernous building that SBC shares with dot-com companies and modeling agencies, among others, is a hulking Caterpillar diesel engine that has been installed to provide backup power for SBC's communications gear.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, SBC has contracted to sublet 27,000 square feet from Williams Communications, which also provides SBC with long-distance communications capacity. This is mostly a Lucent shop. Technicians were installing a new voice telephone switch made by Lucent Technologies and were installing racks for more advanced equipment that uses a technology called asynchronous transfer mode, which helps transmit voice, video and data communications on a single network.</p>
        <p>On the other side of a wire mesh wall, Williams technicians were installing complex optical networking equipment made by Nortel Networks and Cisco Systems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre said that early next year SBC would unveil a major marketing and advertising campaign aimed at building the SBC brand outside the company's traditional markets. The company's deal with the F.C.C. requires SBC to provide local phone service under the SBC brand to any consumer in the covered markets who want it. So when that advertising begins, SBC may get serious about serving consumers.</p>
        <p>To start, however, business customers are clearly the focus. In the 26th Street lounge, for instance, is a map showing the local Verizon switching offices where SBC is installing equipment. Only one is in Brooklyn and another is in the Bronx. But eight are in the business corridors of Midtown and Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In a cramped suite of offices in the Chrysler Building, Lorraine Davis, who runs the New York sales force, was making her initial push by focusing on business customers that spend at least $25,000 a month on communications services. SBC plans to begin offering services in New York next month, and on one office wall there was a plan for pitching a major Manhattan law firm. The sales representative who used to handle the law firm for a rival communications company was recently hired by SBC and is now plotting to win the account for his new employer. By the end of this month, Ms. Davis plans to manage a New York sales staff of about 100 people.</p>
        <p>''You have a tremendous amount of opportunity here,'' she said, ''but all the competitors are also here.''</p>
        <p>And that is a big reason why, in the end, many telecommunications experts expect the real opportunity for SBC to be serving the branch offices of big corporations that already use SBC back home -- companies like, say, the auto giants that use Ameritech around Detroit.</p>
        <p>''In general, the out-of-region strategies are really going to be a way to serve in-region customers with out-of-region needs,'' said Megan Kulick, a telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''Is SBC going to be a major competitor across the board in New York? Probably not. They just don't have a competitive advantage in that market. For them to commit a big amount of resources to compete against an incumbent who has a big advantage obviously would not be wise.''</p>
        <p>William J. Rouhana Jr., who as chairman of Winstar Communications Inc., a small competitive local communications company based in New York, has an interest in SBC's failure, predicted: ''They're not serious. They will do the minimum they have to to meet the regulatory requirement they face.''</p>
        <p>Almost the entire cadre of competitive local phone companies is in the dumps right now, with their stocks near all-time lows, but many regulators believe the Bells have it in them to become powerful competitors.</p>
        <p>As a condition of their merger to create Verizon, GTE and Bell Atlantic this year agreed to a set of expansion conditions somewhat similar to SBC's. But because GTE was not a Bell company subject to special rules, regulators appeared to have less leverage over the Bell Atlantic deal than they did over SBC's acquisition, and Verizon has much more flexibility than does SBC to put its concessions into effect.</p>
        <p>As a company that will a bear much of the brunt of SBC's offensive, Verizon, at least, is not taking its latest competitor lightly.</p>
        <p>''They are one of the top telecommunications companies,'' said Thomas J. Tauke, Verizon's senior vice president for public policy and external affairs. ''We expect SBC to be a major competitor across the country.''</p>
