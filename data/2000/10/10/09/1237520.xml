        <p>Diplomatic and military dialogue steered Israelis and Palestinians away from a broader confrontation today, but leaders on both sides remained braced for the possibility that the fighting that has already claimed at least 85 lives could still worsen.</p>
        <p>As Israel shut down tonight to observe Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement became the most severe 24-hour test yet of what remains of the peace process after a stern warning from Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Saturday that Israel would use ''all available means'' if the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, did not quell Palestinian rioting.</p>
        <p>American diplomats, trying to coax the two sides back to the bargaining table, floated proposals about possible new meetings of both sides with President Clinton in Egypt or Washington this week, but neither  Israelis nor Palestinians appeared disposed toward compromise.</p>
        <p>With violence having spread this weekend from the West Bank into Lebanon and inside Israel itself --  reaching into the family of the American vice-presidential candidate Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, whose second cousin was killed in the West Bank this weekend -- the anger in both communities make it extraordinarily difficult to resume negotiations, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak repeated his ultimatum today, saying that without a reduction in violence, Israel will end peace talks and begin responding to Palestinian disturbances with even greater force. Unless there is ''a calming of the situation, we will draw the conclusion that Arafat has deliberately decided to abandon the negotiations,'' Mr. Barak said.</p>
        <p>Palestinians, angered by Mr. Barak's ultimatum, retorted that the peace effort was already put in forced hiatus by the scores of Palestinian casualties in clashes with Israeli troops during the last 10 days. ''If it is dead, it has been killed by Mr. Barak,'' said the Palestinian Information Minister, Yasir Abed Rabbo.</p>
        <p>The 48-hour period Mr. Barak had set began ominously with more violence, and there were numerous rock-throwing clashes between Jewish and Arab civilians reported in the West Bank throughout the day.</p>
        <p>But there was some evidence that both Israeli and Palestinian forces sought to avoid direct armed confrontations today. Nowhere did Israeli and Palestinian security forces engage in the sustained firefights of the last 10 days. In Nablus, Palestinian officials vowed to rebuild and protect the Jewish shrine known as Joseph's Tomb, which was destroyed by Palestinian rioters on Saturday.</p>
        <p>In what Israeli and American officials considered a constructive development, the Gaza security chief and Israeli army commander for the zone today agreed on a limited, local cease-fire agreement that included Palestinian guarantees for the safe transit of Israeli civilian and military vehicles. The Palestinians also promised to halt the release of imprisoned terrorists and to lower the level of anti-Israeli vitriol in the semi-official media.</p>
        <p>Israel, meanwhile, refrained for now from initiating large-scale retaliatory attacks against Lebanon for cross-border guerrilla attacks and the abduction on Saturday of three Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah fighters.</p>
        <p>Lebanon was the scene of intensive diplomatic activity today, as the Red Cross and the United Nations joined French, German and other intermediaries in efforts to negotiate a resolution to the crisis.</p>
        <p>Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Hezbollah faction, tentatively agreed to let United Nations representatives visit the three hostages, who are said to be well, according to television news reports in the Arab world tonight.</p>
        <p>Still, an Israeli military official said, ''we are keeping all our options open.'' And Mr. Barak has said he will hold the governments in Beirut and Damascus accountable for the fate of the three men, implicitly threatening punitive air strikes against both nations.</p>
        <p>Along the northern border, the army massed tanks and heavy artillery, while the air force prepared its F-16's and Apache helicopters for possible action.</p>
        <p>Tanks were also wheeled into position in Jerusalem and the West Bank, where troops reported sporadic exchanges of gunfire with Palestinian gunmen on the fringes of several major Jewish settlements. Rock-throwing battles between Jewish and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem's Old City also raised tensions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's advisers made clear today that Israel would respond with special fury to any attacks on Israeli citizens or territory during the 24-hour holiday, considered the most sacred day of the Jewish religious year. As is traditional in Israel for Yom Kippur, all traffic stopped an hour before sundown, all stores closed, all television broadcasts ceased. But the Israeli military remained on alert. And for the first time since the 1973 war on Yom Kippur with Egypt and Syria, Israeli  military radio is staying on the air throughout the solemn holiday with an emergency bulletin service.</p>
        <p>''I sincerely hope that our neighbors know what it is to respect the holiest days of their neighbors,'' said Yitzhak Herzog, the Israeli cabinet secretary.</p>
        <p>Apparently in an effort to eliminate one site of deadly clashes, this morning the Israeli army demolished three Palestinian apartment buildings at a Gaza crossroads.</p>
        <p>A few miles south, Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a busload of Israeli civilian airport workers, wounding nine. The Israelis responded by closing the Gaza airport to all flights ''except those of Chairman Arafat'' -- a move that infuriated Palestinians, as it forced the cancellation of anxiously awaited medical relief flights from the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>Israeli helicopters pounded targets in Hebron said to have been the source of rifle attacks against the small Jewish settlement there, while Palestinians buried a young man who was killed Saturday by a band of armed settlers. A Jewish Israeli motorist died this morning after his car was hit by a rock on Israel's coastal highway, and an Arab Israeli was reported killed during mob clashes between Jews and Muslims in Nazareth tonight.</p>
        <p>One West Bank unit of a powerful armed Palestinian faction, Fatah, today distributed leaflets calling for ''continuing clashes'' with Israelis, including inside Israeli territory, and the abduction of Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank. ''I wouldn't rush to speak of an all-out war, but without a doubt we're in a period when if the Palestinians choose confrontation, there will be a confrontation,'' said Maj. Gen. Uzi Dayan, Israel's national security chief.</p>
        <p>On both sides, there was a notable closing of ranks today.</p>
        <p>In Gaza City tonight, Mr. Arafat met with top aides and representatives of the hard-line fundamentalist Hamas and Islamic Jihad movement to coordinate a joint response to what they termed the new ''Israeli threat.'' The Palestinian government earlier urged a protest boycott of Israeli and American products.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials seemed unfazed by the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution on Saturday night condemning Israel for ''excessive force,'' though Washington's decision to abstain from rather than veto the resolution did concern some.</p>
        <p>''Anything that looks like American even-handedness, or even a tilt against Israel, will be interpreted by Arafat as newly tepid American support for the state of Israel, so the effort to give him a clear red light to stop the conflict will be more difficult,'' said Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The Israeli cabinet, which adjourned for Yom Kippur, is scheduled to reconvene Monday night to discuss the possible formation of a unity government incorporating the right-wing Likud party and other opposition factions. Mr. Barak acknowledged that with such a ''broadly based government'' it would be difficult if not impossible to continue talks with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>''In the situation today, on the brink of war, we must immediately restore law and order and we have to show internal unity, and for that we need a national emergency government,'' Natan Sharansky, the former interior minister, said today.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best indicator of how profoundly the Israeli mood has changed in the last few days is the prospect that the rightist opposition leader, Ariel Sharon -- blamed by Arabs for touching off the violence with a visit to Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem's Old City on Sept. 28 -- could soon be appointed foreign minister. It is the most powerful cabinet portfolio available and would be his price for entering such a coalition.</p>
        <p>Another price, Mr. Sharon said, would be for Israel to rescind the negotiating compromises Mr. Barak put on the table at the Camp David talks in July, a move that would effectively set the peace process back a year.</p>
