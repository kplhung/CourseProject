        <p>Before the last decibel of applause had faded, before Donatella Versace had breathed a sigh of relief, the editor who oversees Women's Wear Daily, Patrick McCarthy, was out of his seat and bolting for the exit. So were Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief, and her comrade Andre Leon Talley. So, too, were 30 other people whose uppermost thought, as the Versace show ended on Oct. 6 before 8 p.m. and a weak Milan season came to a close, was to be on the last plane out to Paris on that night.</p>
        <p>Seldom has the sight of editors fleeing into the night invited more boredom with fashion. If insiders can't put the Italian collections behind them fast enough, what are mere mortals expected to think when they see the clothes for themselves next spring? And if, for their part, designers here can't produce a single look that says even to a jaded consumer, ''Here is something new and you must have it,'' then Paris will always be the city where you want to wake up.</p>
        <p>If one looked, one could find a fashion pulse in Milan. It was there at Giorgio Armani, and in the pop-sensational clothes of Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, with their unabashed love of Madonna. One found it in surprising places, too -- at Max Mara, where the pulse had begun to slow in previous seasons -- and with more brain work, at Prada, with its undercurrent of antifashion. These were collections where one sensed the presence of honest-to-goodness design -- not some jive attempt to push the limits of acceptance and make people feel old or unhip if they don't get it, but the kind of change that comes from a solid knowledge of design and women and yet can still make you tremble and ask, Why now?</p>
        <p>''That's the definition of fashion -- 'Why now?' '' Karl Lagerfeld said before his great Fendi show on Oct. 5. A master of moving the fashion conversation to a new place without closing the door on the old one, Mr. Lagerfeld continued to give volume to his clothes, but now with touches of bias shirring that articulated a more fluid line. Out came loosely draped dresses in black jersey or deep brown chiffon with a band of ruching going lightly around the body. Jersey rippled in drapery folds down the front of a brown T-shirt top with a slim black skirt. But there was nothing boudoir about the look. These are drapes for the street.</p>
        <p>To say that Mr. Lagerfeld brings a strong element of creativity to his clothes sounds absurd. Of course, he does. He's a designer. He isn't just taking black jersey and making another bland slip dress out of it. He's taking the liquid fabric and ingeniously combining it with brown cotton poplin, so that the back of the dress billows out in soft, eccentric folds. A nod to Balenciaga? Sure, but how many designers working today can make a connection to the past without the result screaming ''retro''? Only someone who each season rigorously asks himself the question, Why now?</p>
        <p>Antonio Berardi put on a fine show on Oct. 6 for Pucci. There were sleek minidresses with rows of fabric-covered buttons on the sleeves and cute hot pants in a refreshing palette of soft gray and white mixed with petal green and warm yellow. The simple empire dresses highlighted Mr. Berardi's great choice of fabrics, like cotton lace and cotton batiste (does anybody else use batiste anymore?), and the Pucci prints were less ululating.</p>
        <p>The portrait collars of the homey cotton jackets and blouses that opened the Miu Miu show, also on Oct. 6, brought to mind wheat-gathering peasants in some sort of Communist-era tableau. But Miuccia Prada's collection had a modern, if slightly drab, charm. Those tops were belted over full skirts, and some of the newer styles were gathered in tiny, drawstring folds at the waist.</p>
        <p>Oblivious of the season, Ms. Prada showed mohair sweaters with wide stripes in red and charcoal. There was a sense, conveyed mainly by shirts that had cigarette-box-shaped pockets and by a khaki miniskirt that looked inspired by a workman's utility belt, that Ms. Prada was marshaling her young converts for chic boot camp.</p>
        <p>Before her show on Oct. 6, Ms. Versace said: ''I wasn't ready to get out of the luxury moment. I felt that women finally looked refined.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Versace wasn't about to lose the momentum she has gained over the past couple of seasons, so she stuck with simple dresses in white or black jersey that spilled in drapes off one shoulder and were cinched with wide belts. There were snug leather suits with the sleeves pushed bosslike up to the elbows, and abstract flower prints in peacock blue, deep red and pink.</p>
        <p>A high-neck black mousseline blouse looked cool over black leather trousers, and there were sexy patches of rhinestones and ruching. The collection was slight on inspiration, but in a chaotic season, Ms. Versace may have sensed it was time to take a pause.</p>
        <p>Bruce Willis was the season's big front-row guest, and he arrived at the Versace palazzo for a post-show dinner with a posse of bodyguards and minders. While the actor sat with Ms. Versace at one table, his entourage demanded to be seated at another, even though the seats were reserved with place cards for editors.</p>
        <p>There was a tense moment as one of Mr. Willis's men put his beefy face to within inches of a Versace employee's face. But one wouldn't have missed the scene for the world. With editors on one side of the long table and the bodyguards on the other, it was like having dinner with the Sopranos.</p>
