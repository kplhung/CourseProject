        <p>It showered Champagne on two coasts last night, in the clubhouses of both New York baseball teams. At Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens, and the Coliseum in Oakland, Calif., the Mets and the Yankees won their division playoff series. Both teams will advance to the four-of-seven-game League Championship Series, the Mets in the National League and the Yankees in the American League.</p>
        <p>The Mets beat the San Francisco Giants, 4-0, getting a one-hit shutout from the veteran right-hander Bobby J. Jones to win the three-of-five-game series, three games to one.</p>
        <p>In Oakland, the Yankees scored six runs in the first inning and hung on to eliminate the A.L. West-champion Athletics, 7-5, in the fifth and deciding game.</p>
        <p>For decades, New York sports fans have dreamed of having the World Series all to themselves again. It happened seven times from 1947 through 1956, but since the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants migrated West, no World Series has involved two New York teams.</p>
        <p>That could change this year, if the Mets get past the St. Louis Cardinals and the Yankees beat the Seattle Mariners. The Yankees play host to Seattle at Yankee Stadium tomorrow, in the opening game of the A.L.C.S. On Wednesday, the Mets begin the N.L.C.S. at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won last year's American League pennant and went on to win their second straight World Series championship, but the Mets fell two games shy of meeting them in the World Series when they lost the N.L.C.S. to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The Mets have made breathless baseball their habit, winning extra-inning thrillers twice against San Francisco this season and once last season against Atlanta. The Yankees' habit is grander, if perhaps more methodical: in three of the last four seasons, they have trampled the competition en route to World Series championships.</p>
        <p>This October has already been tougher. The Yankees lost only one game in the postseason in 1999, but they lost twice to the Athletics.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees' dynasty is faltering, the Mets will be more than happy to start their own.</p>
        <p>''We want to take care of our own business,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''If, in fact, it is a head to head with the Yankees a couple of weeks from now, we'd love to steal their thunder.''</p>
