        <p>After a weekend of violence between Israelis and Palestinians that threatened to spill across the region, the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, today appealed for Arab restraint, saying that ''those who speak of war do not know the meaning of the word.''</p>
        <p>The Egyptian leader spoke amid a flurry of high-level consultations aimed at developing a common Arab approach, as street protests and angry denunciations of Israel continued across the Arab world. His aim appeared to be to steer Arabs away from popular fury toward policies that would reflect the harsh lessons learned on the four occasions since 1948 when bitterness has flared into conflicts that ended with overwhelming Israeli victories.</p>
        <p>''Declaring a war is not something simple,'' Mr. Mubarak said in remarks to Egyptian reporters. ''We are in a very grave situation which demands a wise reaction.'' In what appeared to be a reference to statements by hard-line leaders who have called for Arab military attacks on Israel, including the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, and the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Mr. Mubarak, who leads the Arab world's most populous nation, said peace was ''still possible'' if Arab nations ''use reason and stop outbidding ourselves'' with hard-line statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak's remarks followed a series of interviews he gave in recent days in which he made some of his most hostile remarks on Israel in his 19 years as president. On Egyptian television on Friday, he accused Israel of using ''excessive force'' against ''unarmed Palestinians'' and said Israel appeared to want to ''stand up against the world.'' On Thursday, he told Egypt's army newspaper that the peace deal that Washington has been urging on Palestinians, involving Israeli sovereignty over most of Jerusalem, ''would be a time bomb that would explode in the faces of us all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak spoke as the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation, and new tensions between Israel, Lebanon and Syria over the capture on Saturday by Hezbollah guerrillas of three Israeli soldiers, stoked fierce emotions across the Arab world.</p>
        <p>One measure of growing international concern was the arrival late on Sunday in Syria of the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, who was scheduled to travel on to Lebanon, Israel and Egypt. In Damascus, Mr. Ivanov was scheduled to meet the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, as well as Mr. Qaddafi, who began an extended Middle East tour of his own last week.</p>
        <p>For days, Arab capitals, including Cairo, have been roiled by street protests that have drawn large crowds, as well as campus protests and bitter denunciations of Israel by Arab leaders, including many like Mr. Mubarak who have forged peace or trade with Israel.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the mood has seemed like a throwback to the period before the Oslo peace accords of 1993, when antagonism for Israel often seemed like the only enduring political bond between Arab nations.</p>
        <p>One of the largest protests took place today in Morocco, one of the Arab nations with the closest ties to Israel. According to news agency reports, a crowd of more than half a million people, including the prime minister, Abderrahman Youssoufi, a veteran leftist who spent years in exile before returning to head the Moroccan government two years ago, marched through the streets of Rabat, the capital. Agency reports said the crowds burned Israeli flags and carried banners denouncing Israel's ''war of extermination'' against Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak's more conciliatory remarks today came as Egyptians concluded an annual holiday commemorating the war with Israel in October 1973, celebrated here although an initial strike against Israel quickly turned into Egyptian losses. Mr. Mubarak, who is 72, is a former air force commander who was deputy war minister in the 1973 conflict. Since he came to power after the 1981 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, he has been a principal architect of Middle East peace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak's shift appeared to have been prompted by developments on Saturday. The capture of the three Israeli soldiers on Israel's northern border prompted Israel to issue a stern warning to Lebanon and even Syria, the dominant power in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Next, Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, also warned Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, that the peace process could end if he failed to rein in Palestinian attacks following days of violence that killed at least 85 people, mostly Palestinians. That set off a wave of apprehension that the situation could spin out of control, enveloping Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and possibly even Jordan and Egypt in conflict. In this scenario, the entire security architecture in the Middle East would be at risk of unraveling, including the peace pact Egypt signed with Israel in 1978, which has remained the cornerstone of Egypt's foreign policy.</p>
        <p>In effect, Mr. Mubarak appeared to have found himself today at a political crossroads. For more than 10 weeks, since the collapse of the Camp David peace talks between Israel and Palestinians in July, Mr. Mubarak has been unyielding in the face of American appeals for Egypt to use its influence with Mr. Arafat to accept the peace deal he rejected at Camp David. In one of his bluntest moments, he told President Clinton during a meeting at the Cairo airport in August that no Arab leader could support the American proposal that sovereignty over the Muslim holy sites in east Jerusalem remain with Israel, and that Mr. Arafat would be assassinated if he accepted the deal.</p>
        <p>In the wake of Mr. Mubarak's appeal for caution by the Arab states today, Western diplomats said the Egyptian leader appeared to have recognized that the entire region had reached the edge of an abyss, and that moderation was essential.</p>
        <p>The diplomats said that stance was the one Mr. Clinton had urged on Mr. Mubarak since Camp David, most recently in a call on Saturday.</p>
