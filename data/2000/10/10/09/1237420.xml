        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I applaud Nafis Sadik of Pakistan, an obstetrician with the United Nations who has been working for women's sexual rights in the developing world for more than 20 years (news article, Oct. 2).</p>
        <p>You say the United Nations Population Fund's new annual report finds that ''until discrimination against women ends, the world's poorest countries -- where women are also often the most oppressed -- cannot develop to their potential.''</p>
        <p>You report Dr. Sadik as saying, ''I remember making speeches in 1975 saying unless women had rights to control their own fertility, they would have no other rights.''</p>
        <p>I find it of note that we are still struggling with that issue here in our own country in the year 2000. Women must vote in November to preserve their right to make decisions about their own lives.</p>
