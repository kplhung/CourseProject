        <p>The first conversation Vojislav Kostunica ever had with Slobodan Milosevic took place on Friday night, when Mr. Milosevic, faced with a popular revolt, finally conceded defeat in the Yugoslav presidential elections and agreed to go on television to say so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, 56, a constitutional lawyer born into a family rooted in the law with a tradition of opposing the Communists, had always kept his distance from Mr. Milosevic. That was a sharp contrast to more prominent opposition leaders like Zoran Djindjic and Vuk Draskovic, who had negotiated with him or even joined his ruling coalition.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Kostunica's image as the anti-Milosevic -- his apparently uncorrupted, humble, unpretentious and somehow normal air -- that made him a perfect candidate for the elections, which became a referendum on Mr. Milosevic himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, having a deep sense of Serbian history and nationalism and being an outspoken critic of NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, could not be accused of ''collaboration'' with NATO and the West. He was a bridge over which many Milosevic supporters could walk into opposition.</p>
        <p>But when the opposition -- a loose coalition of 18 parties, including his own -- asked him to be their candidate, it took Mr. Kostunica a long time to decide to run, he said. He kept wondering why some opposition leaders, who had never disguised their mistrust of his nationalism, wanted him as their candidate.</p>
        <p>His devotion to principle was often seen by others, not always incorrectly, as a form of political inactivity and obstinacy. One other leader said: ''He always knew what was wrong with everyone's ideas. He knew what he didn't want, but not what he did.''</p>
        <p>He described his own indecision about running this way: ''It was a joke that among the undecided voters in Belgrade was Vojislav Kostunica.'' But opinion polling showed him as the opposition's best candidate -- with the most positives, and, most important, the fewest negatives. Mr. Kostunica soon understood that the task was both important and inescapable, he said.</p>
        <p>Overcoming what he describes as his innate skepticism and pessimism, he began a campaign of retail politics, driving all over Serbia to shake hands, hold rallies and appear on the local news. When he won the election outright in the first round but was denied victory through vote fraud, he refused any effort by Mr. Milosevic to compromise.</p>
        <p>Vojislav Kostunica was born in Belgrade on March 24, 1944. He graduated from Belgrade University Law School in 1966, earning a master's in 1970 with a thesis on ''The Political Theory and Practice of the Constitutional Judiciary in Yugoslavia.''</p>
        <p>In 1974, however, he was fired from his job as a lecturer at the law school for defending a senior professor's criticism of changes to the Constitution made that year by Tito. In 1989, when Serbia's new leader, Mr. Milosevic, tried to co-opt intellectuals and offered to rehire those fired in 1974, only Mr. Kostunica refused.</p>
        <p>Moving to an academic institute, Mr. Kostunica got a doctorate in 1976 with a thesis on ''Institutionalized Opposition in Capitalist Political Systems,'' which formed the basis for a book. Despite his criticism of American foreign policy, he describes himself as a Western liberal, with a belief in free speech, an independent media and judiciary and the rule of law. He translated the Federalist Papers into Serbo-Croatian in 1981, and was a member of a committee to defend freedom of speech in the early 1980's, when the post-Tito government cracked down on advocates of nationalism ranging from Franjo Tudjman in Croatia and Vojislav Seselj in Serbia to Alija Izetbegovic in Bosnia and Adem Demaci in Kosovo. Two of them -- Mr. Tudjman and Mr. Izetbegovic -- went on to become presidents of their republics, just as Mr. Kostunica has now of his.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Djindjic, he helped found the Democratic Party in 1989, but in 1992 it split and he left to begin his own Democratic Party of Serbia. He and the party believed that the Serbian national question was central, and he supported the efforts of Radovan Karadzic for self-determination by the Serbs in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica condemned ethnic cleansing and gave no support to paramilitaries. But he has criticized The Hague's war-crimes tribunal as a political instrument of American policy, not an independent legal institution. And he says he will not arrest Mr. Milosevic or hand him over to the tribunal for trial on charges stemming from the Kosovo war. Mr. Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who has been living in Belgrade, were both indicted for war crimes in Bosnia. Mr. Kostunica has refused to say whether he would extradite them, saying he has more important priorities just now and that extradition is not within the competency of the Yugoslav president. Another complication is that both men are citizens of Bosnia, not Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Kostunica's refusal to answer there is a clear reluctance, but also an understanding that turning the two men over to the tribunal might be part of the price for the reintegration into Europe that Yugoslavia craves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica speaks English, German and French. He and his wife, Zorica Radovic, also a lawyer, live with a dog and two cats in a small apartment in the Dorcol section of Belgrade. However impractically, he says he wants to remain there even as president, choosing not to occupy the official residences used by Tito and Mr. Milosevic.</p>
