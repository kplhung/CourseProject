        <p>A distant cousin of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman who had lived in Israel for 15 years was found slain in a gully near the West Bank town of Nablus over the weekend after being abducted by Palestinian rioters as he tried to defend a Jewish holy site they were demolishing, Israeli and American officials said.</p>
        <p>The body of the victim, Hillel Lieberman, 36, the son of a Brooklyn rabbi and a second cousin of the Connecticut senator who is the Democratic candidate for vice president, was not immediately identified when found on Saturday. His body showed signs of what officials called a brutal beating.</p>
        <p>But the identification was made yesterday even as an unknown Palestinian guerrilla faction claimed responsibility for his killing. On the eve of Yom Kippur, the killing plunged his American and Israeli families into despair and prompted expressions of outrage from Jewish leaders in Brooklyn and Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, a graduate of Yeshiva University in Manhattan, was last seen by his Israeli wife and seven children on Saturday at Sabbath services in their village, Elon Moreh, a Jewish enclave three miles northeast of the Palestinian-controlled town of Nablus.</p>
        <p>Neighbors in Elon Moreh said Mr. Lieberman had left his synagogue in a fury after learning that the Israeli Army in Nablus had evacuated the Jewish holy site known as Joseph's Tomb, where Mr. Lieberman taught and studied in a yeshiva, and that Palestinian mobs were attacking the site.</p>
        <p>Palestinian police officers were to have guarded the shrine but they watched helplessly as the rioters reduced it to a blackened ruins, strewn with Jewish artifacts and torn pages of Hebrew religious books.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, described by acquaintances as a lifelong Zionist and a passionate defender of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank, is believed to have been abducted as he approached the site, Israeli and American officials said.</p>
        <p>Alarmed by his disappearance, his family in Elon Moreh asked for the help of the Israeli police, who, with dozens of friends and neighbors of the missing man, searched in and around Nablus all weekend. Mr. Lieberman's parents, Rabbi Sidney Zvulun Lieberman and his wife, Bracha, were called in Brooklyn. The State Department also sought information on the case.</p>
        <p>Scores of people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in Israel and the Palestinian territories over the last 10 days, and like those of other victims of the violence, Mr. Lieberman's body was found but not immediately identified.</p>
        <p>The Israeli police suspected that the missing man had been killed, however; the Palestinian television in Israel reported that an unknown Palestinian faction had claimed responsibility for abducting and killing him.</p>
        <p>Still, word that his body had been found stunned his American and Israeli families and outraged the Jewish community in Brooklyn, where he grew up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's father collapsed at his home in Midwood, Brooklyn, after receiving the call from Israel at 4:30 p.m. notifying him of his son's death. Hours earlier, he had spoken of his missing son in an interview with touching words of hope whose subtext was dread.</p>
        <p>''There's been nothing,'' he said somberly, seated on a straight-backed chair in a darkened, austere living room, while his wife remained in the kitchen, too upset to see anyone. ''We haven't heard any reports that he's been found,'' he added, ''and our prayers go out for him, of course.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Lieberman said that the family's relationship to Senator Lieberman -- their grandfathers were brothers -- was too distant to be personal. ''He would have no idea who we are,'' the rabbi said, and indeed, the senator said yesterday that he was unaware of that Hillel Lieberman was a cousin.</p>
        <p>Members of Rabbi Lieberman's Orthodox synagogue, Congregation Beth Torah on Ocean Parkway in Midwood, were visibly shaken as they walked to Yom Kippur services last night. Many who knew Mr. Lieberman spoke of his courage and his passion for Israel.</p>
        <p>''He was beyond courageous,'' one member of the congregation said. ''He lived what he believed. He dropped his life, he went to Israel and started over.''</p>
        <p>WHOSE HOLY LAND? A CASUALTY  Correction:  October 13, 2000, Friday  An article on Monday about an American-born Jewish settler killed in the Mideast last weekend misidentified him as a cousin of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. The man, Hillel Lieberman, was found slain near Nablus, on the West Bank. Senator Lieberman said yesterday, after speaking to the man's father in New York, that the father's information about a relationship with the senator was apparently incorrect. Further developments are reported today on Page A10.</p>
