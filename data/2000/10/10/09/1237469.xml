        <p>The Big East is a basketball conference. It is a crime that its football champions are automatic qualifiers in the Bowl Championship Series bowls. Frank Beamer of Virginia Tech?

        <p>The Big East is a basketball conference. It is a crime that its football champions are automatic qualifiers in the Bowl Championship Series bowls. Frank Beamer of Virginia Tech? Butch Davis of the University of Miami? They could not carry the clipboard for such football geniuses as Steve Spurrier, Phillip Fulmer, Lloyd Carr and John Cooper, let alone giants like Bobby Bowden and Joe Paterno.</p>
        <p>Sound familiar? It should, because every fall these are the verses sung about the sorry state of college football in the East. Well, forgive the chest thumping echoing from Miami to Blacksburg, because at this moment in a topsy-turvy season, the Big East is playing the best college football in America. Do not take my word for it. The Hurricanes upended top-ranked Florida State on Saturday and poll voters took notice.</p>
        <p>Miami (4-1) moved to No. 4 in the Associated Press writers' poll and No. 6 in the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll, while Virginia Tech (5-0) of the Big East remained at No. 3 in the writers' poll and was bumped up to No. 2 in the coaches' poll. It is the first time since Sept. 12, 1993, that two teams from the Big East ranked in the top 6 of the major polls. Then, it was Miami at No. 3 in both polls and Syracuse at No. 4 in the writers' poll and No. 6 in the coaches' poll.</p>
        <p>Know-nothing voters, you counter?</p>
        <p>The numbers, please. The Big East boasts the best winning percentage of the six B.C.S.-guaranteed conferences. Big East teams are 19-4 out of conference for an .826 victory percentage. The Southeastern Conference is 23-6 (.793); the Pacific 10 is 23-7 (.767); and the mighty Big Ten is 22-13 (.629 percent).</p>
        <p>For every 27-24 upset of Florida State, there is a rout of an overmatched opponent, like the Hokies' 52-23 rout of Akron.</p>
        <p>Yet, the New York Times computer ranking, released today for the first time this season, determined Virginia Tech is No. 1, Miami is No. 2 and Nebraska, which the two other polls have on top, is No. 3.</p>
        <p>Two things are significant about the Times ranking. First, a computer crunches data such as opponents' records and margins of victory. Second, it is one of eight computer ranking services the B.C.S. uses as part of its formula to match the top two teams in the title game, which will be on Jan. 3 at the Orange Bowl in Miami.</p>
        <p>There is too much football remaining to put the Hurricanes or the Hokies in the title game. Only one of them is likely to play for the title because they play each other on Nov. 4 in Miami. And, presuming both win the rest of their games, it will be winner take all. But as the Big East's nonconference record indicates, the rest of the league is not going to roll over for them.</p>
        <p>Early in the third quarter on Saturday, Virginia Tech was ahead only by 21-13 at home against Temple. The Hokies are not the same senior-laden team that threatened Florida State in last year's title game. Michael Vick is the most exciting player in the nation, but he is only a sophomore and it showed against the improved Owls (3-3) when he turned the ball over three times and was sacked four times.</p>
        <p>Besides the Hurricanes, the Hokies must go to Syracuse (3-2) and beat Pitt (4-1) at home. The Orangemen beat the Panthers, 24-17, in a second overtime on Saturday in a game that showed both are capable of hard-nosed defense to go along with their imaginative offenses. The Hurricanes, too, travel to Syracuse and play host to Pitt. They have already lost to Washington and have no margin for error.</p>
        <p>What is fair to say, however, is that Miami and Virginia Tech are only two of four teams left who not only are in control of their title aspirations but may have the firmest grip on them. Like the Hurricanes and Hokies, Nebraska (5-0) and Kansas State (6-0) will play each other in what will be an elimination game for the loser. Complicating matters, however, is that the Big 12 also has a conference championship game.</p>
        <p>The Wildcats, who inexplicably were vaulted ahead of the Hokies to No. 2 in the writers' poll, learned the danger of that the hard way in 1998, when they suffered their only loss of the season, against Texas A&amp;M. They remember the Alamo -- that is the bowl they ended up in.</p>
        <p>They fell out of the B.C.S. bowls -- the Orange, the Rose, the Sugar and the Fiesta -- because of their soft schedule and the late-season loss. Those obstacles loom for them again, and for another undefeated team: Clemson (6-0). The Tigers are ranked No. 9 in the Times ranking because of a 12-14 opponents' record while the Wildcats are at No. 14 because of an almost embarrassing 7-19 opponents' mark.</p>
        <p>The wild card is perhaps Ohio State. It is 5-0 with a respectable opponents' record of 14-9. It is ranked No. 4 by the Times computer, No. 6 in the writers' poll and No. 5 in the coaches' poll.</p>
        <p>But even if the nonconference record does not reflect it, the Big Ten is the most competitive league. Penn State beat Purdue, which knocked off Michigan over the weekend. It is hard to imagine the Buckeyes going undefeated. If they do, they belong in the title game.</p>
        <p>So does the Big East champion, if it is Virginia Tech or Miami. Last year, an undefeated Hokies team had to sweat to the final week of regular season for its berth in the title game. That will not happen this year. The numbers are in the Hokies' and Hurricanes' favor. So are perceptions, as the subjective polls show.</p>
        <p>The Big East now is a football conference, too.</p>
