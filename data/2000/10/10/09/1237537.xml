        <p>In the Champagne-drenched Mets locker room at Shea Stadium, the celebration spilled over into every corner last night. Armed with bottles that they used to soak anyone who walked by, the team's highest-profile players -- Mike Piazza, Mike Hampton and Al Leiter -- celebrated as wildly as anyone.</p>
        <p>But it was not these stars who carried the Mets in their 4-0 victory over the Giants in Game 4, or in the entire division series, which the Mets won, three games to one. In Game 2, it was the heroics of Darryl Hamilton and John Franco's performance out of the bullpen. In Game 3, Benny Agbayani became a Shea Stadium folk hero. And last night, the stage was set for the redemption of Bobby J. Jones and Robin Ventura.</p>

        <p>In the Champagne-drenched Mets locker room at Shea Stadium, the celebration spilled over into every corner last night. Armed with bottles that they used to soak anyone who walked by, the team's highest-profile players -- Mike Piazza, Mike Hampton and Al Leiter -- celebrated as wildly as anyone.</p>
        <p>But it was not these stars who carried the Mets in their 4-0 victory over the Giants in Game 4, or in the entire division series, which the Mets won, three games to one. In Game 2, it was the heroics of Darryl Hamilton and John Franco's performance out of the bullpen. In Game 3, Benny Agbayani became a Shea Stadium folk hero. And last night, the stage was set for the redemption of Bobby J. Jones and Robin Ventura.</p>
        <p>While Jones pitched the game of his life, completing a tale that would be a little too hokey for Hollywood, Ventura emerged from a batting slump that has encompassed most of the season to provide all the runs that Jones needed with a two-run home run in the first inning.</p>
        <p>Ventura went through his first 10 at-bats of the series without a hit, then singled in the 11th inning of Game 3. In his first at-bat yesterday, he took the first pitch from the Giants' starter, Mark Gardner, and sent it 405 feet or so away, off the scoreboard in right-center field.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't really matter about the season,'' Ventura said. ''I'd rather be swinging the bat a little bit better now than anytime during the year. We'll see what happens later. Everybody has done it for us. Benny did it for us last night. We've had guys do that for us all year long. Timo Perez coming up and doing things, Edgardo doing stuff all year. We have a team that has a lot of guys that can make some impact during a game.''</p>
        <p>Al Leiter said: ''It's not tennis or golf. It's a team sport. You need everybody to do their one twenty-fifth, their share, to help win a championship. This team, whether it's this year or last, we've always had a new hero. This is fitting today. A lot of so-called experts predicted a high-scoring game. Bobby Jones looked at everybody and said, 'Yeah, you know where you can go.' He internalized it all, became very aggressive, and pitched magnificent.''</p>
        <p>Jones came back from injuries and a trip to the minor leagues this season to return to the mound last night with his greatest performance with a one-hitter.</p>
        <p>Franco returned to the Mets this season only after acknowledging that he no longer would be the closer, instead serving as a setup man and mentor to Armando Benitez.</p>
        <p>And last season Ventura was so good and provided the most magical of moments when he hit a grand-slam single in the 15th inning against the Braves in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series. Thanks to his home run yesterday, the season goes on with opportunities for those sort of heroics again.</p>
        <p>If these players never lost faith in themselves, Manager Bobby Valentine stuck with them, too. Despite his troubles at the plate this season, Ventura was in the clean-up spot in the batting order last night.</p>
        <p>''What I see is the Mets uniform they're wearing,'' Valentine said. ''I'm behind it. I support guys who believe in themselves. When they lose a little bit of confidence I try to fill that void. When the hole is big, then I'm not with them. No one out there ever doubted themselves.</p>
        <p>''Robin is another pro. He is a confident guy. Everyone is looking at the stats and saying, 'Oh, poor Robin,' and Robin knows that. He goes out there every day and contributes to our team's effort. And this is 97 wins so far, and he's been a part of every one of them. He understands.''</p>
        <p>Piazza does, too.</p>
        <p>''This is what a team is,'' Piazza said. ''You win as a team. Everybody feels like they're part of this ball club. This is what it's all about, a bunch of guys working together. This game is all about getting another chance. That's what makes this game great.</p>
        <p>''Bobby Jones had some rough breaks this year and rebounded just beautifully. He's a champion like we all are. We all work hard as a team. That's what it's all about. He didn't get down. He came back strong and just really pitched his butt off today. And Robin is just the foundation on this ball club. His big home run today got us momentum, got Bobby in his groove, and that's what it's all about.''</p>
        <p>Franco said: ''We're like a family. One guy can't do it, you pick up for him.''</p>
