        <p>In the end, the soldiers of the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard came home from Bosnia without using the ammunition they took there.</p>
        <p>In nearly eight months overseeing American peacekeepers in Bosnia, they never fired a shot, either intentionally against enemies of peace in that tense land or accidentally when clearing their weapons as a safety measure when entering buildings on their base near Tuzla.</p>
        <p>That they never engaged in combat is a measure of the stability taking root in Bosnia. That they never slipped up on firearms safety is in some ways just as important a measure of the military discipline that some have long felt is lacking in the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard.</p>
        <p>''Not everybody in the National Guard is as screwed up as they thought we were,'' Specialist Frank T. Hinnant 3d of Bellville, Tex., said in an interview in Bosnia just before returning home.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, in a traditional rite that included a Russian military band playing ''The Yellow Rose of Texas,'' the division relinquished its command of the American NATO sector in Bosnia, rolling up its battle flag and turning over the operation to the regular Army's 3d Infantry Division.</p>
        <p>Today, the last of some 650 men and women of the 49th returned to the division's headquarters at Camp Mabry in Austin, tearfully reuniting with their families eight months to the day after President Clinton called them away to active duty.</p>
        <p>The 49th completed its mission having erased at least some of the doubts about the National Guard's role in military operations. But its experience also raised questions about how often the Pentagon can turn to soldiers who normally spend no more than a weekend a month and two weeks each summer in uniform.</p>
        <p>The 49th's commanders oversaw the safest spell in Bosnia since  American troops began arriving five years ago in December, with no deaths or major accidents, officials said, even though active and reserve troops under its command flew 14,000 hours in the air and covered 1.25 million miles on the ground. Maj. Gen. Robert L. Halverson, the 49th's commander, said his worst safety problem was sports injuries.</p>
        <p>The soldiers kept a lid on the lingering tensions that divide Bosnia's Serbs, Muslims and Croats, despite several especially volatile events, including a grenade attack on a house near Zvornik, where American special forces were staying, and a commemoration by thousands of women whose husbands and sons died in the  massacre in Srebrenica in 1995.</p>
        <p>More than 8,000 refugees returned to their homes in the American sector during the 49th's command. The 49th succeeded in pressing Bosnia's two armies, one Serb and the other Muslim and Croat, to cooperate for the first time on reconstruction projects, including bridges in Celic, Besici and Mackovac.</p>
        <p>''Victory comes in inches, not in miles,'' said Lt. Col. James Brown, the owner of a well-drilling company in Tyler, Tex., who commanded the civil-affairs unit overseeing reconstruction efforts.</p>
        <p>For the National Guard, however, this was not a victory measured in inches. The 49th's deployment culminated a trend in which the Pentagon has relied more heavily than ever on the Guard and Reserves for missions like the one in Bosnia. And its successes have already had an effect on the Army; in particular, clearing the way for officials to consider expanding the Guard's role still further.</p>
        <p>The 49th's soldiers and other Guard units made up less than a quarter of the 4,300 American troops in Bosnia. Next year, when the 29th Infantry Division from Virginia takes command, three-quarters of the troops will be from the National Guard and Reserves -- and not just primarily in the headquarters, but also in operational units, including 300 more members of the 49th from the Rio Grande Valley.</p>
        <p>''The success of the 49th makes people who weren't comfortable much more comfortable in shouldering that kind of burden,'' said Brig. Gen. H. Steven Blum, the commander of the 29th, with troops from Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. ''There were people saying, 'Uh, I don't know.' There's less reluctance now.''</p>
        <p>The 49th's successes, however, have come at a price, for the Army and for the soldiers.</p>
        <p>Since the 49th, like other Guard units, has to make do with older, often outdated equipment, the Army  had to equip its soldiers with the newest radio system just so they could communicate with the active forces under their command.</p>
        <p>Other Guard and Reserve soldiers  received the newest M-16 rifles only  when they left for Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Then there is training. Although the law allows the president to activate Reserve units for only 270 days, the 49th's officers and soldiers spent at least 108 days training for the mission before they mobilized in February.</p>
        <p>Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army's chief of staff, who flew to Bosnia to  attend the change of command, called the 49th's deployment ''a tremendous step forward for the Army,'' which has long had internecine rivalries with the Guard. At the same time, however, General Shinseki questioned how deeply the Army could tap into the 350,000 soldiers of the Guard.</p>
        <p>General Shinseki has already limited future Guard deployments overseas to six months, shorter than the 49th's tour. He ordered General Halverson to review the training the 49th went through to see whether it could be compressed, shortening the time Guard soldiers are forced to be away from their jobs and families before and during deployments.</p>
        <p>''I think in peacetime there is a limit to how often and how deeply we can go to the Reserve component,'' General Shinseki said en route to Bosnia. ''I know this is not an open-ended deal.''</p>
        <p>For the 49th's soldiers, the deployment was an affirmation of the Guard's latent abilities.</p>
        <p>''If we're going to be relevant in the national military strategy,'' Lt.  Col. Larry D. Rutherford, the operations commander, said as he packed his duffel bags to leave Bosnia, ''we felt like we needed to give something.''</p>
        <p>Col. Thomas A. Roman, who commanded the information operations cell, said that for him, that was a local television network his troops established, along with five programs about the peacekeeping efforts -- a sort of Bosnian ''On the Road With Charles Kuralt,'' as he put it.</p>
        <p>For Capt. Geoffrey C. Ryan, a seventh-grade science teacher in Weslaco, it was putting into place a new system for monitoring the removal of land mines, which resulted in 85 square miles of land being cleared, nearly as much as in the previous three years.</p>
        <p>When the deployment began, many of the 49th's soldiers said they encountered subtle and not so subtle doubts from the active-duty troops, most of them from one of the Army's elite combat units, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. There were condescending comments and occasional efforts by the 3rd's officers to bypass the 49th's commanders, they said.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Maj. Charles H. Cromwell, who served in the 49th's engineering  battalion, did not feel he had much to prove. He wears a combat patch on his right sleeve, signifying his tour in Vietnam 30 years ago. That experience -- and the performance of the troops in Bosnia -- overcame many of the doubts, he said.</p>
        <p>For the 49th, the challenge now is returning to their civilian lives. In Washington, officials express concern that the increasing deployments could hurt the Guard's ability to recruit and retain soldiers. So far, the Texas National Guard has not suffered an exodus, but General Halverson said the division's commanders would monitor the impact of the Bosnia deployment carefully.</p>
        <p>For the soldiers of the 49th, there has already been an impact. Several have lost their jobs, despite a federal law prohibiting retribution against Guard or Reserve troops called to duty. A few marriages have crumbled.</p>
        <p>Specialist Hinnant lost his job and his wife. Before he left, his employer, a contractor in Bellville, told him he would not have his position as a welder back. When he returned for leave in August, his wife, Tina, asked for a divorce after 10 years of marriage.</p>
        <p>Still in Bosnia, he settled on a simple solution to his problems: ''Stay here,'' he said. He and 32 others from the 49th chose to extend their service on active duty for an additional six months.</p>
        <p>The rest flew to Fort Hood on Thursday. Today, after a last round of paperwork, three buses carried the last of them to the 49th's headquarters here at Camp Mabry. General Halverson mustered the troops one last time, with their families beside them, and praised what they had accomplished. Then his executive officer, Capt. Christopher C. Ryan, barked one final order: ''Dismissed!''</p>
        <p>About the Series</p>
        <p>This is one of several articles about the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard describing the troops' deployment in Bosnia, where the unit led the American sector of a NATO peacekeeping force.</p>
