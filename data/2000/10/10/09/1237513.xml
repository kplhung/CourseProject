        <p>The New York City Police Department has fallen short of its recruitment goals. Besides increasing numbers, it needs to attract more officers from minority communities, building a police force that has more in common with the people it polices. But Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik's decision to relax the age and education requirements is a bad idea. Instead, the department should dramatically expand its recruiting and find creative new ways to attract and retain mature, well-educated candidates. For starters, the new effort should focus on the college-age population within the city itself, especially at the City University of New York.</p>
        <p>The department has historically drawn its  recruits from the ranks of former military men accustomed to discipline and self-restraint. After the draft was abolished, police recruits tended to  be raw high school graduates who had little discipline or experience following orders. The department tried to compensate for this problem in 1995, when it raised the minimum age for new recruits from 20 to 22 and and required that they have two years in the military or two years' worth of college credits.</p>

        <p>The New York City Police Department has fallen short of its recruitment goals. Besides increasing numbers, it needs to attract more officers from minority communities, building a police force that has more in common with the people it polices. But Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik's decision to relax the age and education requirements is a bad idea. Instead, the department should dramatically expand its recruiting and find creative new ways to attract and retain mature, well-educated candidates. For starters, the new effort should focus on the college-age population within the city itself, especially at the City University of New York.</p>
        <p>The department has historically drawn its  recruits from the ranks of former military men accustomed to discipline and self-restraint. After the draft was abolished, police recruits tended to  be raw high school graduates who had little discipline or experience following orders. The department tried to compensate for this problem in 1995, when it raised the minimum age for new recruits from 20 to 22 and and required that they have two years in the military or two years' worth of college credits.</p>
        <p>There were many applicants the first year, but since then the pool has shrunk. Mr. Kerik therefore announced last month that he was dropping the age requirement from 22 to 21 and would allow some recruits to substitute work experience for college credits. The department attributes the dearth of applicants to competition from higher-paying jobs in the private sector, and to public antipathy after police shot and killed two unarmed black men, Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond.</p>
        <p>But much of the blame lies with the department, which has failed to engage in creative year-round recruiting. For example, the department failed to build on its promising police cadet program, which placed college students in desk jobs where they got a taste for police work and then sent them on to the police academy once they graduated. Among the cadet program's most distinguished graduates is former Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who rose from a part-time college worker to the department's top executive.</p>
        <p>The police department and the City University of New York cooperated on a cadet program during the mid-1990's, when it became clear that the department needed better-educated recruits. But the CUNY program dissolved after a turf fight between CUNY and One Police Plaza. With 200,000 college students -- most of them black, Latino or Asian -- CUNY is an obvious place to turn for a cooperative education program that could feed the police department's needs. Using stipends and other financial incentives, the department could attract a promising applicant pool.</p>
