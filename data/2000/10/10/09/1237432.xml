        <p>No sooner do the leaves start falling than the thoughts of retailers -- and the analysts who track them -- turn to the coming holiday shopping season.</p>
        <p>For Internet retailers, consumers' holiday shopping habits are monitored particularly closely. The health of the industry rests on how many shoppers head to their computers instead of to the mall in December, and on how much they spend while they are clicking.</p>
        <p>The latest company to take a stab at making these predictions is Nielsen/NetRatings, which plans to release a report this week forecasting that 55 million people, or 20 percent of the population of the country, will visit shopping sites on the World Wide Web this holiday season.</p>
        <p>That represents a 34 percent increase over the 41 million people who visited online shopping sites in December last year, said Sean Kaldor, vice president for e-commerce at  NetRatings Inc.</p>
        <p>Since the company's main work is measuring traffic on the Internet, it did not forecast how much consumers would spend online, although Mr. Kaldor said browsers are more likely to buy during the holiday season.</p>
        <p>''The percentage of shoppers that become buyers doubled from October to December last year,'' he said, ''and we expect the same thing to happen this year.''</p>
        <p>At least two Internet research firms have made predictions in recent weeks about online holiday sales. Jupiter Communications forecast that online sales in November and December will reach $11.6 billion, while Forrester Research projected that consumers will spend $10 billion online between Thanksgiving and the end of the year.</p>
        <p>As for where shoppers are likely to point their browsers, Nielsen/-  NetRatings predicted that ''virtual department stores'' like Amazon.com or Buy.com will have the most traffic, with 22.4 million visitors. Next will be book, music and video stores (11.1 million visitors), toy stores (10.0 million visitors) and apparel retailers (5.5 million visitors), the company said.</p>
        <p>Nielsen/NetRatings based its forecast on traffic data it collected for 715 sites it characterized as shopping sites, which have at least 100,000 visitors a month.</p>
