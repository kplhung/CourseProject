        <p>As Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde lay on the grass yesterday, writhing in pain, Jets fans at Giants Stadium held their breath. This was deja Vinny all over again. Last season, in the first half of the first game, Testaverde ruptured his Achilles' tendon while diving for a fumble.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Testaverde was sacked on the Jets' first offensive play of the game by Pittsburgh's Jason Gildon, and when he left -- feeling the sting from a pinched nerve in his neck -- so did the Jets' chances of staying undefeated.</p>
        <p>Ray Lucas is the best backup in football and someday soon will be starting for another team, though he simply didn't have a chance against the Steelers yesterday because Testaverde got most of the work in practice this week.</p>
        <p>But the Jets' offense is geared for Testaverde: his pocket passing and accurate deep throws are perfect complements to Curtis Martin and the ground game.</p>
        <p>That is why the Jets are in a precarious position, though this is no time to panic: the team is still 4-1 despite its 20-3 loss to Pittsburgh yesterday afternoon. As Testaverde goes, so go the Jets. And right now, it is impossible to tell just what the future holds for Testaverde.</p>
        <p>He may not be the same all season.</p>
        <p>There is concern simply because of some cryptic comments coming from Coach Al Groh and Testaverde. Like this one from Groh when asked if Testaverde would start next week against New England, ''The future will be dealt with in the future.''</p>
        <p>Did Groh steal that from a greeting card?</p>
        <p>Or Testaverde, answering a similar query, responded, ''We're going to take it one day at a time.''</p>
        <p>Those are not exactly ringing endorsements for Testaverde's health.</p>
        <p>The Jets organization is not very forthcoming about player injuries. It turns out that for the past three weeks Testaverde has been fighting nerve damage in his neck, and the pain radiates throughout his nonthrowing arm, causing weakness and numbness. The velocity of Testaverde's passes has also been affected.</p>
        <p>Yet, mysteriously, Testaverde's injury has not shown up on a league report. The National Football League said yesterday that technically -- technically -- what the Jets did in hiding Testaverde's injury may not be a violation of league rules because the Jets believed he would start against Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Semantics, semantics.</p>
        <p>When a Pittsburgh official was told that Testaverde had nerve damage that affected his throws, the official said there was a small chance the Steelers might file a complaint with the league. The Steelers would argue that Testaverde should have been listed as probable on an injury report, and by not doing so, the Jets received a competitive advantage.</p>
        <p>Testaverde received at least one magnetic resonance imaging scan to diagnose the injury, and he has also been taking medication to help speed the healing process. He will receive more tests today.</p>
        <p>If there is anyone who can beat this injury, it is Testaverde. He is one of the more fit players on the team, and he is also very tough, both physically and mentally. ''Vinny's a warrior,'' Lucas said. ''I'm sure he'll be back.''</p>
        <p>The question is, when he does, how effective can he be? Will this be an injury that will dog Testaverde for the rest of the season, or can he heal completely and begin throwing normally?</p>
        <p>These nerve injuries are not uncommon in football, though it is rare for quarterbacks to get them. Many linemen and linebackers play with nerve stress their entire careers. It can be painful but they can continue being effective players. A linebacker just needs to hit somebody. There is little precision required to do that.</p>
        <p>''I've had those nerve problems before,'' Jets offensive lineman Jumbo Elliott said. ''Sometimes the pain would come in games and it would be hard to lift my arm. But I could still play. You just tough it out.''</p>
        <p>A quarterback with the same injury faces different problems. When Testaverde drops back to pass and goes through his throwing motion, a sharp pain -- one that players describe as knives poking up and down your back and arm -- can affect both the direction of the ball and how fast it gets there.</p>
        <p>Testaverde's problems will cause stomach pains for Groh. In a way, he will have to prepare both quarterbacks for the rest of the season. Even if Testaverde heals this week and can play against the Patriots on Sunday, one tough hit could force the same situation the Jets faced yesterday, playing a rusty backup.</p>
        <p>So the Jets may consider giving Lucas more repetitions in practice. They had better.</p>
        <p>Testaverde should get credit -- lots of it -- for playing despite what must be at times harsh pain. He also spoke to the news media for a good 20 minutes after the game, even as his left arm was numb down to his hand.</p>
        <p>''I've had better days,'' Testaverde said.</p>
        <p>If Testaverde heals, more are on the way.</p>
