        <p>In a matter of days, three pitchers with a combined 11 Cy Young awards were shelled in the first round of the playoffs and a hitter with two Most Valuable Player awards couldn't get a hit in an entire playoff series. What's going on here?</p>
        <p>Nothing really. It's only an extension of performances baseball has long seen from some of its star players. Sometimes the performance is an isolated experience, limited to one postseason or one World Series. Other times the performance is a career-long postseason stumble.</p>
        <p>The Atlanta Braves, the only baseball team to win nine consecutive division championships, are no longer in this year's playoffs. They were dropped out of the pursuit of the World Series championship in three devastatingly quick losses to the St. Louis Cardinals. Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, their starting pitchers 1 and 1A, each started one of those games. Neither lasted long.</p>
        <p>Maddux lasted four innings, giving up seven runs (five earned). Glavine didn't make it through the third inning, allowing seven runs (all earned). Then came Roger Clemens, whose five Cy Young awards are the most by one pitcher. He has also won more of those awards than postseason games.</p>
        <p>Clemens pitched the Yankees' first game of this year's playoffs and lost. Oakland scored four runs against him in six innings. Clemens started again in Game 4 on Saturday, with the Yankees in position to conclude that series and move on to the American League Championship Series. But the Athletics battered Clemens for six runs in five innings, sending the Yankees back to the Bay Area to try to snare the admission card to the A.L.C.S.</p>
        <p>Clemens took with him a career postseason record of 3-5. Maddux went home for the winter with a 10-11 postseason record, Glavine with a 10-12 mark.</p>
        <p>Frank Thomas went home, too. He powered the Chicago White Sox to the A.L. Central championship but apparently misplaced his bats on the way to the playoffs. The Seattle Mariners held him hitless in nine times at bat and quickly dispatched the White Sox in the minimum three games. A strong candidate for yet another M.V.P. award, Thomas will not be penalized for his inept playoff performance because voting is based on the regular season.</p>
        <p>What happens to this caliber of player from the last day of the regular season to the first day, or first appearance, of the postseason? Hitters' sudden shortcomings are more readily explained.</p>
        <p>Late-season scrutiny of players on contending teams increases. Teams send scads of scouts to watch every pitch of several weeks of games. The number of scouts attending games has itself increased. Wealthy teams like the Yankees set the pattern, and other teams follow as well as possible.</p>
        <p>By the time the first playoff game arrives, managers, pitching coaches and pitchers know every possible batting peculiarity of every player. But the scouts pay special attention to a team's primary run producers and their tendencies. Pitchers pay closer attention to what pitches seem to have a better chance of neutralizing big hitters.</p>
        <p>''Don't let Frank Thomas beat you,'' pitchers are told. Or, ''Don't let Barry Bonds beat you.'' And they take it seriously.</p>
        <p>That's why players like Brian Doyle and Melvin Mora and Timo Perez have a better chance to produce big hits. Pitchers are less likely to bear down on them having escaped an at-bat or two against a Bonds or a Thomas.</p>
        <p>Why good pitchers self-destruct in postseason games is not as easily explained. Perhaps Clemens is an exception. He has a reputation of imploding in big games, getting so pumped up that he tends to overthrow and becomes less effective than he would be if he simply relaxed and pitched.</p>
        <p>When Maddux or Glavine are hit harder in a playoff game than they might be during the season, it's possible that hitters become more disciplined. Instead of trying to pull a pitch on the outside corner they go the other way with it.</p>
        <p>Consider some of the career World Series won-lost records of these Hall of Fame pitchers: Walter Johnson 3-3, Burleigh Grimes 3-4, Rube Marquard 2-5, Christy Mathewson 5-5, Eddie Plank 2-5, Don Drysdale 3-3, Don Sutton 2-3.</p>
        <p>Some players perform well in one postseason series but fail in another. For example, Dave Stewart, a four-time 20-game winner, had an 8-0 record in the League Championship Series but won twice and lost four times in the World Series. Bernie Williams has batted .367 in the league series but .151 in the World Series, has driven in 13 runs in 16 league series games, 7 in 14 World Series games.</p>
        <p>Some premier hitters have poor career postseason records; others are notorious for having performed poorly in one series. World Series time always prompts recollection of Gil Hodges's failure to get a hit for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 21 at-bats in the 1952 World Series and Dave Winfield's one hit in 22 tries for the Yankees in 1981.</p>
        <p>Barry Bonds and Mike Piazza are two of the best in baseball's current crop of hitters, but after the fourth game of the series between their teams yesterday, Bonds had a career .196 postseason average (19-97) and Piazza .211 (15-71).</p>
        <p>Willie Mays, who batted .302 during his career, was only a .247 postseason hitter. Joe Morgan, who batted .182 in his postseason experience compared with .271 during the regular season, drove in a run every 3.85 games in the league and World Series but knocked in one every 2.33 games during the regular season.</p>
        <p>Ted Williams played in only one World Series, but his .200 batting average in that one was a wisp of his .344 career average. Stan Musial had a career .331 average but a .256 average in four World Series. Ty Cobb had an even greater contrast, .367 during the season and .260 in three World Series.</p>
        <p>Ernie Banks never had to worry about failing in the postseason. The Chicago Cubs' great shortstop never played in a postseason game. If asked, though, he would say better to have played and not hit than not to have played at all.</p>
