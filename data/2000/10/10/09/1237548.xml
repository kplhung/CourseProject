        <p>A 21-year wait by Formula One's most illustrious team came to an end yesterday as Michael Schumacher won the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, earning his third driver's title and Ferrari's first since 1979.</p>
        <p>It was the culmination of a five-year effort by Schumacher, a German, and the Italian team, which he joined after winning his second driver's title with Benetton in 1995. But until he crossed the finish line it looked as if the team race might still go the way it had each of the past three years, when Ferrari lost the title in the last race.</p>

        <p>A 21-year wait by Formula One's most illustrious team came to an end yesterday as Michael Schumacher won the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, earning his third driver's title and Ferrari's first since 1979.</p>
        <p>It was the culmination of a five-year effort by Schumacher, a German, and the Italian team, which he joined after winning his second driver's title with Benetton in 1995. But until he crossed the finish line it looked as if the team race might still go the way it had each of the past three years, when Ferrari lost the title in the last race.</p>
        <p>Mika Hakkinen, who had to finish ahead of Schumacher to preserve his chances of winning the driver's title, finished as the runner-up by only 1.8 seconds, after he and Schumacher stayed within two seconds of each other through most of the race.</p>
        <p>It was Schumacher's eighth victory this season and his third in a row. He joins five other drivers with three world championships. Only Juan Manuel Fangio (five) and Alain Prost (four) have more.</p>

        <p>LATE CHARGE POWERS LABONTE: Bobby Labonte, who was running sixth before a final pit stop, took four new tires 25 laps from the finish and motored past the leader, Jeremy Mayfield, who took only two, to win the U.A.W. GM Quality 500 yesterday in Concord, N.C.</p>
        <p>Labonte's Pontiac beat Mayfield's Ford to the finish line at Lowe's Motor Speedway by 1.166 seconds. Labonte opened his lead to 252 points in a bid for his first Winston Cup championship with his fourth victory of the season.</p>
        <p>Mayfield finished second, and was followed by Ricky Rudd, Tony Stewart and Mark Martin in a race that had a season-high 46 lead changes among 13 drivers. (AP)</p>
