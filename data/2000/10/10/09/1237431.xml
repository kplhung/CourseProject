        <p>The Microsoft Corporation has been celebrating its 25th anniversary -- ''25 years of technology innovation,'' as Microsoft puts it, by one of the most phenomenally successful companies in history.</p>
        <p>Last month, the company held a huge anniversary party at Safeco Field in Seattle, and it was attended by 15,000 employees. Microsoft also published an anniversary book listing every employee's name, 39,510 in all. And on Tuesday, Microsoft will throw another big anniversary party in Washington.</p>

        <p>The Microsoft Corporation has been celebrating its 25th anniversary -- ''25 years of technology innovation,'' as Microsoft puts it, by one of the most phenomenally successful companies in history.</p>
        <p>Last month, the company held a huge anniversary party at Safeco Field in Seattle, and it was attended by 15,000 employees. Microsoft also published an anniversary book listing every employee's name, 39,510 in all. And on Tuesday, Microsoft will throw another big anniversary party in Washington.</p>
        <p>For most of its history, Microsoft did not pay much attention to the nation's capital. More recently, as the company fell into trouble with the federal government, Microsoft has kept a large stable of lobbyists in town whose job is to beat back the ever-sprouting challenges and threats.</p>
        <p>None of the lobbying seemed to help the company in federal court, however. In June, a judge in United States District Court found Microsoft in wide violation of state and federal antitrust laws and ordered it broken into two. The ruling is being appealed.</p>
        <p>This week's party will be held at Les Halles, a large, boisterous French-bistro-style restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue, a street that holds some significance for Microsoft. The Justice Department headquarters is also on Pennsylvania Avenue, a few blocks east of the restaurant. And the United States District Court, where the antitrust trial was held, is just off Pennsylvania, six blocks farther east.</p>
        <p>A Microsoft spokesman said the company decided to hold the party in Washington ''just because we thought it would be nice to celebrate our birthday in D.C., as well.'' No similar celebrations are planned in other major cities, like New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Several hundred people have been invited, including the company's several dozen lobbyists, who might come close to filling the restaurant on their own. Cheerful yellow invitations also went out to Congressional staff members, government officials, journalists who write about the company ''and other supporters, friends and people we deal with in town,'' the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Some people whom Microsoft deals with in town were not invited. No one from the Justice Department's antitrust division, which successfully prosecuted the lawsuit, got an invitation, for example, even though the antitrust office is just three blocks from the restaurant. Nor was the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, invited, even though he lives in an apartment on Pennsylvania Avenue, just a few blocks away.</p>
