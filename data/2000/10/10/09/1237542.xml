        <p>There was something different in Bobby Valentine's office last night, something besides the Champagne that clung to the Mets manager's uniform. The time was right, Valentine thought, to place a small wooden star on his desktop. It was a gift from a fan, he said, and it was inscribed appropriately: ''Miracles Happen to Those Who Believe.''</p>
        <p>Surely, it was not a miracle that the Mets beat the San Francisco Giants yesterday, 4-0, to win their first-round playoff series, three games to one, and advance to the National League Championship Series. The Mets, who reached the N.L.C.S. last year before falling two victories short of a World Series berth, have a payroll exceeding $80 million, one of the highest in baseball.</p>
        <p>But the way the Mets did it drew on their miraculous past. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Tug McGraw, a relief pitcher on the Miracle Mets who captured the 1969 World Series and the man who coined the phrase ''Ya Gotta Believe'' in 1973.</p>
        <p>Bobby J. Jones, a veteran right-hander whose career was in tatters four months ago, threw the last pitch, retiring the Giants' Barry Bonds on a fly ball to center field to complete a one-hitter and what he considered the best performance of his career.</p>
        <p>Jones is probably the Mets' least expressive player, and after calmly turning to the outfield to watch Jay Payton make the catch, he pumped his fist, softly. When Jones turned the other way, catcher Mike Piazza embraced him, and third baseman Robin Ventura leaped onto his back. A wild celebration had begun.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know what to do,'' said Jones, who retired the Giants in order in every inning but the fifth. ''I'd never been in a situation like that before. It's just an overwhelming feeling.''</p>
        <p>Jones and the Mets will face the St. Louis Cardinals in St. Louis on Wednesday in the first game of the four-of-seven-game National League Championship Series. The first of three possible games at Shea will take place on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Mets, who lost the first game of the series in San Francisco last Wednesday, recovered to win Game 2 after blowing a lead in the ninth inning. The series shifted to Shea for Game 3, and the Mets came back to win in 13 innings on a home run by left fielder Benny Agbayani. Last night's game was less dramatic: the Mets took a lead in the first inning on a two-run homer by Ventura, and Jones made it stand with what Piazza called ''textbook pitching.''</p>
        <p>Jones does not overpower hitters; his fastball usually registers between 82 and 87 miles an hour, below the major league average. To be successful, he must locate his pitches precisely. When he doesn't, he can be hit hard.</p>
        <p>After eight starts this year, Jones had an earned run average of 10.19. Because he had nearly seven years of major league service, the Mets needed his approval to send him to Class AAA Norfolk in mid-June. Jones gave it.</p>
        <p>''We were worried about him, no question about it,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said. ''When we asked him to go to the minor leagues, we never put timetables on guys, but we knew he was going to have to turn it around or we were going to have to make a decision.''</p>
        <p>Jones came back from the brink. At Norfolk, he altered his delivery and concentrated on rediscovering his slow but sharply breaking curveball.</p>
        <p>He had poor results in the minors, but he was not pitching to get outs. He was working on getting the feel of his pitches back, and when he returned, he had it.</p>
        <p>Jones went 10-3 the rest of the way, re-establishing the form that made him an All-Star in 1997. The Mets could have brought back their No. 1 starter, Mike Hampton, on three days' rest last night in an effort to thwart the Giants and avoid an overnight trip to San Francisco for a decisive Game 5 today. But Valentine believed in Jones; he never discussed an alternative with Phillips.</p>
        <p>Jones rewarded that faith. The game was ''without a doubt'' the best he has ever pitched, Jones said, and he felt he had the best command of his pitches he has ever had, his curveball aided by what he called a weird wind. The only hit Jones allowed was a double by Jeff Kent leading off the fifth, and even that hit grazed Ventura's glove.</p>
        <p>Piazza, who sensed in the early innings that Jones's command was exceptional, said Jones took advantage of a Giants lineup that was trying too hard after falling behind in the first. Kent, the leading candidate for the National League's Most Valuable Player award, agreed.</p>
        <p>''Bobby Jones is a perfect guy to throw against us in this situation, because we're a team that had to do something,'' said Kent, whose team was eliminated after winning 97 games, the most in the majors during the regular season.</p>
        <p>''He was ho-humming everything, and I mean that in a good way,'' Kent said. ''But we didn't ho-hum with him. You've got to control all of your aggressiveness, and that's hard.''</p>
        <p>Jones mastered all the Giants, but Bonds's failure stood out most. The three-time M.V.P. finished the series with 3 hits in 17 at-bats (.176), and he has now been on five playoff teams without winning a series. Bonds was the last Giant to make an out in each of the Mets' victories this series.</p>
        <p>After Kent's double in the fifth, Jones issued two walks and loaded the bases. With two outs, Giants Manager Dusty Baker decided to leave his pitcher, Mark Gardner, in to bat. ''We were short of pitching,'' said Baker, who used five relievers on Saturday, ''and it was the fifth and it was too early'' to pinch-hit.</p>
        <p>Gardner, a .128 career hitter, popped out to end the inning. But he was back on the mound, and after retiring Mike Bordick on a grounder, he struck out Jones for the apparent second out.</p>
        <p>That's when Baker's strategy backfired. The strikeout pitch bounced and trickled away from catcher Doug Mirabelli. Jones raced to first ahead of Mirabelli's throw.</p>
        <p>Coming to bat: Timo Perez, the pesky leadoff man the Giants will not soon forget. Perez ripped a pitch into the right-field corner, moving Jones to third. Edgardo Alfonzo batted next, and after fouling twice with a full count, he stroked a curveball into center field.</p>
        <p>Marvin Benard hesitated, and the ball carried well over his head. Two runs scored as Alfonzo pulled into second with a double, pumping both fists in excitement -- a rare show of emotion for him.</p>
        <p>But this was a night to get excited, and the Mets did, spraying each other with Champagne in an uproarious clubhouse party.</p>
        <p>As Jones gave a television interview, Ventura sneaked up behind him, carrying Jones's 4-year-old son, Breyton, on his shoulders. The boy poured bubbly all over his father's head, and Jones smiled broadly, kissing his son. ''After what I went through in the beginning of the season,'' Jones said, ''to battle back and have a chance to do something in the postseason -- it meant a lot.''</p>
