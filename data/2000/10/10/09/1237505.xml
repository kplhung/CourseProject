        <p>Fifteen years ago, a handful of fast-growing national bookstore chains started a price war on discounting books that became one of the momentous trends in the book business.</p>
        <p>Widespread markdowns on best sellers, tens of thousands of other hardcover titles and even paperbacks delighted consumers and increased book sales. The low prices lured customers to the national chains from independent stores and pumped up best sellers' sales by making them much cheaper than other titles. And when Amazon.com joined the game five years ago, its online book store upped the ante on competitive discounts.</p>
        <p>But this year, the discount era in the bookstore business has virtually come to an end. With none of the fanfare surrounding new markdowns, the dominant bookstore chains, Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders, have quietly raised their prices. So have the online stores Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com, and Borders.com, just a year after their discounts of up to 50 percent on best-selling books escalated the price wars to a new height.</p>
        <p>As a result, consumers are paying more for books. Publishers stand to see the already sluggish growth in book sales suffer from the sharp increase in retail prices.</p>
        <p>But independent bookstores, bloodied by 15 years of struggling to compete against the chains' discounts, are breathing a sigh of relief.</p>
        <p>The bookstore chains say they rolled back their discounts because of rising costs, slowing growth rates and the wisdom of experience.</p>
        <p>The price increases at the online stores are particularly significant, however, because of their implications about the future of Internet bookselling. Although less than 5 percent of consumer book sales last year were made through the Internet, online sales were the fastest-growing part of the business. But the price increases combined with shipping costs make buying many books online more expensive for the first time.</p>
        <p>Amazon.com made headlines in May last year when it announced a new discount of 50 percent off the cover price of books on The New York Times best-seller lists, selling the titles to consumers for just about the wholesale price.</p>
        <p>Amazon was selling most other hardcover books at 30 percent off the cover price and selling most trade paperback books at 20 percent off the cover price. Almost all of its books were offered at some discount.</p>
        <p>BarnesandNoble.com, the second-largest online bookstore, and Borders's online store immediately matched Amazon.com's prices.</p>
        <p>This summer, however, as investors battered its stock, Amazon.com raised all its book prices, according to publishers' sales executives. Last week, Amazon.com's prices were 10 percent higher across the board -- it was selling best sellers at 40 percent off, hardcover books at 20 percent off and paperbacks at 10 percent off. Publishers say Amazon.com now sells more of its slow-selling titles at no discount. Again, the other online stores have followed suit.</p>
        <p>The price increases are a notable reversal for Amazon.com. The company had suggested that the economics of selling over the Internet -- no store rents, no store clerks, better inventory management at central warehouses -- permitted high-volume online stores to maintain steeper discounts than their brick-and-mortar rivals. As recently as June, an Amazon.com spokesman, Bill Curry, said in an interview that the company did not need to change its prices to be profitable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curry declined last week to comment on the company's pricing policy. ''We are constantly reviewing our prices to be competitive,'' he said. ''Price is important, but so are selection, convenience and service.''</p>
        <p>The price increases mean many books are now more expensive online than at the cover price in a traditional store. Amazon.com and other online booksellers charge about $4.50 for shipping the first book and about a dollar to ship each additional book. Including shipping charges, only hardcover books with cover prices above $22.50 are now as cheap online as they are at full price in a traditional store, excluding sales tax. Last year, the break-even price was $15.</p>
        <p>Customers need to order five or more paperbacks at once to make an online purchase less expensive than paying the cover price in a store. As a result, publishers say, hardcovers already sell better than paperbacks at online stores.</p>
        <p>Leonard Riggio, chairman of both Barnes &amp; Noble and Barnesandnoble.com, attributed the rollback of discounts online to new realism about selling books over the World Wide Web. ''The whole paradigm of the Internet is exposed as being more costly than it was advertised to be.'' He said, however, that he thought convenience and selection would still draw shoppers online.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riggio attributed the bricks-and-mortar stores' turn away from widespread discounting primarily to the rising cost of doing business.</p>
        <p>Rents have been soaring, the tight labor market is increasing payrolls and Barnes &amp; Noble has increased its investment in its stores' computer systems, he said.</p>
        <p>''Our customers were telling us that the 10 percent discount wasn't a factor in terms of their purchasing decisions,'' he said. ''So our policy was to be more aggressive on the best sellers, and the only thing I can say is that our pricing policy on everything else is evolving.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Barnes &amp; Noble, whose 550 superstores and 380 B. Dalton stores account for one-fifth of the consumer book market, sold the 15 fiction and 15 nonfiction hardcover books on The New York Times best-seller list at 30 percent off their cover price. Its superstores sold the rest of its hardcover books for 10 percent off their cover price.</p>
        <p>But this spring, Barnes &amp; Noble shifted to discounting its stores' own best-sellers list and scaled back its list of 30 books to 20 books. And the chain dropped its 10 percent across-the-board discount on almost all hardcover books. Barnes &amp; Noble now typically marks down less than 150 of the roughly 150,000 titles in its superstores, usually stacked near the entrance to create the impression of low prices.</p>
        <p>Dropping its hardcover discount is only the latest pullback for the chain. A few years ago, for example, many Barnes &amp; Noble stores discounted almost all hardcover books by 20 percent and nearly half their trade paperback books by 10 percent. Superstores often discounted the fastest-selling half of their books.</p>
        <p>Borders, the second-largest bookstore chain, with 300 superstores and 900 Waldenbooks stores, dropped its 10 percent discount on hardcover titles last fall, said Phil Ollila, vice president for merchandising.</p>
        <p>''We decided the 10 percent discount on all hardcover books that weren't best sellers wasn't driving traffic into the stores,'' he said. Borders superstores now mark 30 percent off the cover price of best sellers and a rotating selection of other titles -- usually up to about 100 of their roughly 150,000 titles, he said.</p>
        <p>Executives at the superstore chains acknowledged that they are raising prices partly because they feel pressure from Wall Street to increase their profits. The proliferation of superstores across the country means adding stores makes less of a contribution to their growth rate.</p>
        <p>Discounts off the cover price have not disappeared, of course. Books-A-Million, which operates 184 gift-and-book stores and an online store, still discounts all of the roughly 75,000 titles in its stores. But the chain, which operates in 17 southeastern states and through an online store, is a discount club. It sells mainly to its members and tailors its choices to their buying habits. It has no immediate plans to challenge the other chains outside its region.</p>
        <p>In addition, some independent stores now discount best sellers as well. But best sellers account for less than 10 percent of all books sold, according to bookstore chains and industry consultants.</p>
        <p>Vigorous, across-the-board markdowns persist primarily outside bookstores, at general merchandise chains and price clubs, which account for about 18 percent of the book market. But they offer only a narrow range of recently published and highly commercial titles, like cookbooks, self-help books and thrillers.</p>
        <p>Bookstores remain the core of the business. Only bookstores sell a broad selection of titles, and it is only after bookstores establish a new book or author's commercial success that other retailers follow. And only bookstores sell older titles, the key to profitability for much serious nonfiction or literary fiction.</p>
        <p>Independent bookstore owners are already crowing about the decline of widespread discounts. Over the last 15 years, small stores, unable to match the well-financed superstores' prices, closed in droves.</p>
        <p>''The chains' success at creating the impression that the independents were expensive and the superstores were deep discounters hurt the independents and hurt them badly,'' said Oren Teicher, the association's chief operating officer. ''That is no longer factually true.''</p>
        <p>The pullback in discounting at the national bookstore chains may be a rude awakening for both publishers and consumers. Publishers have steadily raised the prices on consumer books for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>The average price of a hardcover book of fiction, for example, rose from $24.97 in 1997, to $26.79 in 1998, to an estimated $27.46 last year, according to the editors of ''Books-in-Print.'' Barnes &amp; Noble's Mr. Riggio has publicly denounced publishers for ''foolishly'' overpricing books. Others have questioned book prices, too. ''Hardcover books are simply priced beyond what many people will pay,'' Karen Jenkins Holt, editor of the Book Publishing Report, a newsletter, wrote in a recent study.</p>
        <p>Now that big booksellers no longer blunt the effect of rising cover prices with their across-the-board discounts, the weight of rising book prices may further dampen demand.</p>
        <p>So far, at least, publishers say they are not worried. ''There are other outlets -- the mass merchandisers and price clubs are significant, and they are strongly committed to deep discounting,'' said Peter Olson, chairman and chief executive of Random House, the largest publisher in the United States.</p>
        <p>''I think consumers are barely going to notice the change,'' said Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman of trade publishing at Time Warner.</p>
