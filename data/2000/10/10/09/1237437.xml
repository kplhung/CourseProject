        <p>OM Gruppen A.B., the owner of the Stockholm stock exchange, is expected to revise its offer for the London Stock Exchange and may increase its bid, people close to the negotiations said today.</p>
        <p>The company is ''working out different scenarios'' that could include either adjusting the mix of cash to stock or increasing the overall bid, one person close to the company said. As of Friday, OM's offer was valued at $:742 million ($1.07 billion), or $:25 a share, of which $:7 would be in cash with the rest in stock.</p>
        <p>OM has until Oct. 26 to file its final offer, but such a move is not expected this week because the company will be focused on releasing its nine-month results on Tuesday, one person said.</p>
        <p>''OM feels they've won a lot of the argument on the technology, management and strategy front,'' said another person close to the company. ''One of the outstanding issues is price.''</p>
        <p>Yet it is far from clear whether a sweetened offer would be enough to win over London Stock Exchange shareholders, who, as of last week, seemed unmoved by OM's overtures. Last week, OM Gruppen extended the offer's original closing date until Oct. 23 because it said only about 300,000 shares, or 1 percent of the shares outstanding, had been tendered.</p>
        <p>''Our members aren't just looking for price,'' said Angela Knight, chief executive of Britain's Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers. ''They are looking for a proper pan-European strategy. On that point OM has fallen down badly.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the London exchange have argued that Don Cruickshank, its chairman, has failed to articulate a modified strategy after plans to merge with Germany's Deutsche Borse collapsed last month. This weekend at an investor conference in Brussels sponsored by the investment association, Mr. Cruickshank outlined several plans that he hoped would help the exchange fend off OM's advances. Plans, he said, include creating a European growth market modeled on Techmark, the London exchange for high-technology companies, and exploring ways to lower costs for private investors.</p>
