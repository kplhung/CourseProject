        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Colleges are on sound psychological footing in appealing to student norms about drinking rather than trying to scare students into drinking less (front page, Oct. 3).</p>
        <p>There is much evidence that efforts to arouse fears or change personal beliefs about alcohol abuse are apt to fail. These messages run up against students' defense mechanisms, notably their illusory conviction that ''it won't happen to me.'' By contrast, students are much less likely to react defensively to messages that say their peers don't drink so much.</p>
        <p>Young people are among the least likely to believe they are vulnerable to life's dangers. It is probably easier to convince them that they over estimate how much their peers drink than that they underestimate the personal dangers of binge drinking.</p>
        <p>RICHARD M. PERLOFF  Cleveland, Oct. 3, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of communication, Cleveland State University.</p>
