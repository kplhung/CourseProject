        <p>The previously unsullied Jets sprouted their first ugly blemishes of the season today when quarterback Vinny Testaverde left the game soon after it began with an aggravation of a previously undisclosed pinched nerve in his neck.

        <p>The previously unsullied Jets sprouted their first ugly blemishes of the season today when quarterback Vinny Testaverde left the game soon after it began with an aggravation of a previously undisclosed pinched nerve in his neck. The day got worse for the Jets (4-1) as the rest of the team sleepwalked through a mistake-marred 20-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
        <p>As little feeling as Testaverde said he had in his left arm and hand after he was hit in the back on the Jets' first offensive play, the seemingly numb Jets matched it. The only sign of emotion came from receiver Wayne Chrebet, who disappeared from the locker room before reporters were allowed in and made a visible show of his frustration after Lucas overthrew him on one play, throwing his hands in the air.</p>
        <p>The litany of disappointments was endless. The offense, which had struggled with consistency even as the Jets won their first four games, produced 206 yards, its worst day by far this season. The backup quarterback Ray Lucas, a hero in 1999 after Testaverde suffered his season-ending Achilles' injury, showed none of the spark he provided the Jets last year, passing for just 99 yards on 13 completions in 25 attempts.</p>
        <p>The Jets lost two fumbles, the first fumbles they have lost this season -- including Curtis Martin's first lost fumble in 544 touches dating back to the 1998 playoffs -- and Lucas was intercepted twice. The Jets' last five drives of the game ended: punt, fumble, punt, fumble, interception.</p>
        <p>On top of everything, the Jets had six penalties for 45 yards, and a field-goal attempt by John Hall in the first quarter was blocked.</p>
        <p>The defense was worn down because of long stretches on the field during which the Steelers' Jerome Bettis barreled into them for 107 yards.</p>
        <p>Kordell Stewart, the nimble backup quarterback who started in place of the injured Kent Graham, threw for 140 yards and a touchdown and ran for 33 more yards.</p>
        <p>The Jets' defense gave up its first rushing touchdown of the season when Bettis stretched as he neared the goal line after a 12-yard run. That put the Steelers up by 10-0 with  1 minute 40 seconds remaining in the first half. Hall made a 40-yard field goal at the end of the half to make the score 10-3, but for the Jets, that was the game's high point.</p>
        <p>In the fourth quarter, the Jets' defense gave up the Steelers' first passing touchdown of the season, a 10-yard throw from Kordell Stewart to Bobby Shaw that put the Steelers ahead, 17-3, with 11:33 left in the game. In all, the Steelers had the ball for 37 minutes 43 seconds, 15 minutes more than the Jets, and mounted scoring drives of 94, 87 and 53 yards.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh barely contained his anger, although it was directed largely at himself.</p>
        <p>''When you perform poorly -- and I use the word 'perform' because that's much more inclusive than the word 'play,' which would mean it was only the players -- you lose,'' Groh said. ''And we performed poorly today. I feel I didn't do enough to help the team today and so I take it very personally. Accountability and responsibility belong to everybody in green and white today, and the accountability starts with me and I'm upset about it.''</p>
        <p>As brutal as the loss was, the most ominous development for the Jets was Testaverde's injury. He was hit as he turned his back to protect the ball and himself as he dropped back. When Steelers linebacker Jason Gildon hit him, Testaverde felt pain behind his left shoulder blade, and numbness radiated down his left arm and hand. Testaverde has had such numbness before, he said, but never so severe, and he revealed that he has had at least one magnetic resonance imaging test that showed a bulging disk in his back.</p>
        <p>Testaverde first suffered the injury during the Jets' Sept. 11 victory against the Patriots, and it flared up in the week of practice leading up to the Buffalo game on Sept. 17. His hand has gone numb during the victories over Buffalo and Tampa Bay. He feels the nerve grab when he drops back and looks over his left shoulder. For weeks, there have been whispers that Testaverde's arm strength was not what it should be, but Testaverde insisted he was healthy. Today he conceded that the velocity on his passes has been affected by the pinched nerve.</p>
        <p>Testaverde tried to get up after he was sacked, but he was in too much pain. The trainers knew almost immediately that there was no way he could return. Testaverde has performed exquisitely in the fourth quarters of the Jets' previous games, driving them to three come-from-behind victories. With about 11:30 left in the game and the Steelers comfortably ahead, he briefly removed the coat he wore throughout the chilly day and slapped his left hand against a football.</p>
        <p>He was trying, he said, to get some feeling in his left hand, but to no avail. There would be no reprise of Testaverde's virtuoso performances and, cloaked in his green winter coat, he skulked the sideline with his hands in his pockets, like a specter haunting an offense that was lost without him.</p>
        <p>Testaverde said he will have more tests done this week and that neither he nor Groh could guess at his availability for next week's game at New England. When he met with reporters a full three hours after he was hurt, Testaverde said his hand felt as if it were asleep.</p>
        <p>''I've had better days,'' Testaverde said. ''You feel just helpless on the sideline.''</p>
        <p>The Jets said they did not experience a letdown after four straight victories and a bye week. They said they did not underestimate the Steelers, who had two close calls before finally beating Jacksonville last week for their first victory of the season. But, Lucas admitted, the offense was a bit stunned when Testaverde went down so quickly. Lucas said he was overanxious, causing him to overthrow balls in a discouraging reprise of last season's Jets' troubles. After Testaverde's injury in 1999, the Jets went into a tailspin, but salvaged an 8-8 record by winning their last four games with Lucas at quarterback.</p>
        <p>Early in today's game, Lucas went over to Testaverde and said, ''Don't worry, I got your back today.'' But the offensive performance was as painful to see as Testaverde's injury.</p>
        <p>''We're in shock at first, but it's still no excuse,'' Lucas said. ''Pittsburgh had our number from the start.''</p>
