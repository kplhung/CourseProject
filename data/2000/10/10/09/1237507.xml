Mr. Mubarak did not immediately agree to a mid-week regional summit meeting in Egypt, but said he would discuss it with Yasir Arafat when the Palestinian leader arrived today in Cairo.</p>

        <p>Clinton Seeks Meeting To Cap Mideast Violence  President Clinton asked the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to convene an urgent summit meeting where Mr. Clinton could meet the leaders of Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan, a senior administration official said. Mr. Mubarak did not immediately agree to a mid-week regional summit meeting in Egypt, but said he would discuss it with Yasir Arafat when the Palestinian leader arrived today in Cairo.</p>

        <p>High-level diplomatic intervention and military talks kept the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from growing into an even broader and bloodier confrontation, but leaders on both sides braced for a possible escalation of the fighting.</p>

        <p>Hillel Lieberman, a distant cousin of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, was found slain near the West Bank town of Nablus. Mr. Lieberman, who had lived in Israel for 15 years, had been abducted by Palestinian rioters as he tried to defend a Jewish holy site, Israeli and American officials said.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak appealed for restraint by Arab nations as talks continued in an effort to develop a common Arab response to the crisis. Arab protests against Israel also continued.</p>

        <p>Scandals Plague Argentina  Ten months after President Fernando de la Rua of Argentina took power, the economy remains in the doldrums and a federal judge is investigating whether cabinet members paid bribes to up to 11 senators. And with the resignation of Vice President Carlos Alvarez, above, Mr. de la Rua is scrambling to save his government.</p>

        <p>Forging Democracy in Belgrade  President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia is struggling to consolidate his authority over Serbia and his own allies, trying to find a balance between revolutionary justice and legality in the post-Milosevic era. His coalition has formed a ''crisis committee,'' a kind of parallel government to the Serbian authorities linked to Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Townspeople in Cacak, Serbia, gathered in the main square to celebrate. Residents of the town, one of the most determinedly anti-Milosevic places in Serbia, were core participants in the crowds that overran the federal Parliament last week.</p>

        <p>Administration Will Issue Rules on Patients' Rights  With legislation to define patients' rights languishing in Congress, Clinton administration officials say they will soon issue rules that establish many of the same protections for more than 130 million Americans with private health insurance. The rules will set new federal standards for the handling of claims under employee health benefit plans.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Spending Bills Pile Up  Congress is trying to cram a session of work, including the passage of nine spending bills to keep the government running, into four days beginning tomorrow. Republican Congressional leaders must negotiate with the White House on three spending bills laden with politically charged issues like abortion, gun control and education funding.</p>

        <p>Gore Plans to Delegate Attacks  Vice President Al Gore's campaign is planning a multimedia offensive this week that assails Gov. George W. Bush over his record in Texas and his occasional slips of the tongue, Gore aides said. The strategy calls for Mr. Gore to delegate attacks so he can remain above the fray.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Many Blacks Back Vouchers  While established African-American organizations have opposed school vouchers, maverick black politicians and community organizers are increasingly the public face of the pro-voucher movement financed largely by white Republican businessmen. Polls show strong support for vouchers among African-Americans.</p>

        <p>Evaluating the Guard  The last of the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard returned home last week, eight months after they were called away to active duty. The 49th erased at least some of the doubts about the National Guard's role in military operations. But its experience also raised questions about how often the Pentagon can turn to part-time soldiers.</p>

        <p>Endangered Species Cloned  Scientists at a Massachusetts biotechnology company say they have cloned an endangered Asian gaur and implanted the resulting embryo into a cow in Iowa. It is expected to give birth to the gaur next month. The gaur, an oxlike creature, would be the first clone of an endangered species and also the first cloned animal to use another species as a surrogate mother.</p>

        <p>Clinton and Lazio Agree On Mideast, but Little Else  In their second debate, New York's two main Senate candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, condemned the United States for abstaining on a United Nations resolution censuring Israel for the violence in the Middle East. But they offered opposing views on campaign financing, abortion, gasoline taxes, potential Supreme Court appointees and public financing for a proposed stadium in Manhattan.</p>

        <p>Corzine and Franks Trade Jabs  Representative Bob Franks and Jon S. Corzine jabbed at each other for nearly an hour in their first debate of the United States Senate campaign in New Jersey, attacking each other's records, campaign tactics and stands on issues like health care, the environment and gun control.</p>

        <p>The End of Cheap Books  The discount era in the bookstore business has virtually ended. The big bookstore chains and online stores have raised their prices. Many books will now be more expensive online than at stores. The chains cite rising costs and slow growth.</p>
