        <p>JOE DRAPE</p>
        <p>LESSONS IN MOTIVATION,</p>
        <p>Part I -- Colorado Coach Gary Barnett, disgusted by his team's 0-4 start, benched one starting linebacker Saturday against Texas A&amp;M, put three other players on indefinite strength and conditioning leave and stripped the team's logo from the players' helmets. The result? A 26-19 victory over the Aggies.</p>

        <p>Highlights and lowlights from the weekend.</p>
        <p>JOE DRAPE</p>
        <p>LESSONS IN MOTIVATION,</p>
        <p>Part I -- Colorado Coach Gary Barnett, disgusted by his team's 0-4 start, benched one starting linebacker Saturday against Texas A&amp;M, put three other players on indefinite strength and conditioning leave and stripped the team's logo from the players' helmets. The result? A 26-19 victory over the Aggies.</p>
        <p>Part II -- Florida Coach Steve Spurrier, discouraged by his defense's play in a loss the previous week against Mississippi State, found inspiration after watching the Country Music Awards, which bestowed the best song award on ''I Hope You Dance'' by Womack. He told his defensive players that they didn't look as if they were having fun and challenged them to ''go dance.'' The Gators' defense responded with an enthusiastic showing in a 41-9 victory over Louisiana State.</p>
        <p>MY KINGDOM FOR A KICKER</p>
        <p>Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden wasn't the only coach wishing he had an accurate leg at crunch time. Florida State's Matt Munyon, a freshman walk-on, missed a 49-yard field-goal attempt that would have sent the game in overtime. Instead, Miami scored a 27-24 upset. In Syracuse's 24-17 overtime victory over Pittsburgh, the Orangemen's Mike Shafer missed four field-goal attempts, and the Panthers' Nick Lotz missed two and an extra point. Shafer had a chance to win the game on the final play of regulation but missed from 40 yards. In the first overtime, Lotz couldn't put a 30-yard kick through. Shafer had another chance to win it but was wide from 36 yards. In the second overtime, Syracuse's Troy Nunes threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to David Tyree.</p>
        <p>SEEING RED -- Josh Heupel led Oklahoma to touchdowns on its first five drives as the Sooners routed Texas, 63-14, scoring the most points in the 95-game history of the Red River rivalry. By halftime, Oklahoma scored six touchdowns, one more than the number of first downs Texas had. The 77 combined points were a series record and the winning margin was one shy of the biggest, a 50-0 Oklahoma victory in 1908.</p>
        <p>ICE HIS ARM -- Zamir Amin of Menlo College set an NCAA all-divisions record, passing for 731 yards in the Division III school's 37-32 loss to Cal Lutheran. Amin, 39 of 66 with four touchdowns, and three interceptions, broke the mark of 716 set by David Klingler of Division I-A Houston against Arizona State in 1990.</p>
        <p>SO SORRY -- ''I want to apologize to all of the Texas fans, our players and assistant coaches. You can't play that poorly and have a head coach do anything right during the week.'' -- Texas Coach Mack Brown taking the blame for a 63-14 loss to rival Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>WHO NEEDS A TRAVELING SQUAD? -- ''I thought the kicking game was good. Other than that, we should have left everybody else at home.'' -- Auburn Coach Tommy Tuberville after his team gained only 164 yards in a 17-10 loss to Mississippi State.</p>
