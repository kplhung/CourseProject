        <p>A Bronx synagogue was vandalized yesterday, hours before the start of Yom Kippur.</p>
        <p>The police were investigating the attack, in which a bottle of purplish liquid was thrown against an entrance door at the Conservative Synagogue Adath Israel of Riverdale, at West 250th Street and the Henry Hudson Parkway, at 9 a.m. The attack caused initial concern that someone had thrown a firebomb, but the police had ruled out that possibility by the afternoon.</p>
        <p>As the police were investigating, Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx left the Hispanic Day Parade on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to meet with synagogue leaders. He issued a statement condemning the incident, calling it a bias attack.</p>
        <p>''The perpetrators will be hunted down and prosecuted,'' Mr. Ferrer said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also traveled to the Bronx after hearing of the incident. ''The mayor wanted to reassure everyone,'' said his spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel.</p>
        <p>The attack came after a week in which some Jewish and Palestinian residents in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, said they were worried that the violence in the Middle East might be replicated in New York.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn last week, vandals struck a synagogue and painted anti-Semitic graffiti on a Jewish cemetery, and two Jewish men reported being attacked. In the first attack, a Hasidic man was slashed on Oct. 1 as he strolled along Eighth Avenue in Sunset Park, by an assailant who identified himself as Palestinian. In the second attack, a Jewish man told the police that he was kicked as he left a B train at the Fort Hamilton Parkway station, by a man who some witnesses said was with a group carrying a Palestinian flag.</p>
