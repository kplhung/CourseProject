        <p>Letter from Assemblywoman Deborah J Glick of New York says Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep Rick Lazio are right to ban ads by political parties from their Senate contest, but opposes extending that ban to independent issue-oriented groups</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I'm baffled by the debate over soft money in the New York Senate race and the ban on advertising by outside groups that Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio have agreed on (news article, Oct. 6). Many voters are reluctant to trust the candidates' own campaign ads, which they perceive as self-serving spin. The advocacy groups voters look to for truth about issues -- groups that work tirelessly on specific subjects, like the Sierra Club and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League -- are the very organizations banned from advertising by the soft money prohibition.</p>

        <p>Not only are the First Amendment rights of these groups compromised, but so is the availability of information voters deem relevant to them in making informed decisions. Banning advertisements by political parties makes sense; banning ads by independent issue-oriented groups does not.</p>
