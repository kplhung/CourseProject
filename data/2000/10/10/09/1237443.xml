        <p>They came from Slovenia and Slovakia, from Israel and Iceland, from Turkey and Colombia and the Republic of Georgia, mostly middle-aged men, graying around the temples, descending on the elegant Hotel Du Cap in their almost matching monotone dark suits and ties.</p>
        <p>The event that brought this group together was the first international gathering of hosts of the game show, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the British-created television sensation that has literally swept the globe in a wave of high ratings. The 23 television personalities from six continents, assembled by the show's production Company, Celador, for a kind of team photo and exchange of production ideas, were clearly overjoyed at the chance to talk a little shop.</p>
        <p>''Our celebrity week was huge,'' said Eddie McGuire, the host from Australia.</p>
        <p>''We haven't done celebrities,'' said Alain Simons, a host from Belgium. ''Do you tape two shows a day or three? I find it hard to concentrate when I have to do three.''</p>
        <p>That a program like ''Millionaire,'' hatched in Great Britain, not in the United States, took center stage at the MIPCOM conference, the international television market held here each year where programming is bought and sold, was the most dramatic evidence of how the long-time pecking order in the global business has been transformed over the last year.</p>
        <p>Throughout the history of the event, American production companies dominated the conference, arriving as sellers confident they could fill the schedules of most of the world's broadcasters with translated or subtitled versions of everything from ''Hill Street Blues'' to ''Baywatch.'' But this year, for the first time, the Americans arrived as much as buyers as sellers, eager to purchase the kind of European-based formats of reality shows, like ''Millionaire'' and ''Survivor,'' that have shaken up the entire landscape of prime time network competition in the United States, the executives here said.</p>
        <p>To underscore the sudden conviction that such European programming is a necessary part of the future of the business,  American production companies like Warner Brothers and Paramount are making plans to establish offices in foreign countries to create local programs, or else to buy up foreign production companies to jump-start them as local players in the  program-creation business.</p>
        <p>None of this means that American programming does not sell. It still does -- especially if it is a glossy action show with high production values. The Walt Disney Company is reporting healthy sales in international distribution. A Warner Brothers show for CBS, a new version of the classic, ''The Fugitive,'' sold in almost every foreign market in near record time, Warner executives said.</p>
        <p>And top programs like ''E.R.'' and ''X-Files'' still have no trouble selling in translation to channels around the world. But second-tier programs are finding it harder and harder to do business, several American production company executives said.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the change is the success of offshore-created formats like ''Millionaire'' and ''Survivor.'' The identification of potential hit program formats -- adaptable to the United States market -- has become a kind of obsession with American production companies and networks.</p>
        <p>As one executive with a Hollywood talent agency put it, ''Formats are the coin of the realm at the moment.'' The executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the pursuit of format rights had begun to consume much of his time.</p>
        <p>Nobody doubts that ''Millionaire,'' now on the air in 35 countries and sold as a format in 45 more, is the centerpiece of the revolution. Paul Smith, the managing director of Celador, said he takes special pride in one achievement.</p>
        <p>'' 'Millionaire' broke the mold in America,'' he said. ''American television networks have been very conservative. This has changed their attitude toward overseas programs and now we suddenly have two-way traffic.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the American buyers continue to snap the multi-country formats up, partly because they want protection in case of a strike by Hollywood actors and writers in mid-2001. When they can, they would like very much to sell them as well, as indicated by efforts here by three of large entertainment companies to buy the international format rights to ''Survivor.'' Ben Silverman, an agent from the William Morris Agency who has negotiated the deals for numerous reality shows in the last two years, said he is talking with the three companies for the ''Survivor'' format rights on behalf of Charlie Parsons, the British creator of the series. A representative of Warner Brothers confirmed that the company is among those in talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman declined to mention the figures being discussed, but another executive familiar with the negotiations said Mr. Parsons is seeking about $30 million.</p>
        <p>The companies talking about buying the format rights to ''Survivor'' want to cash in on what is expected to be the second or third most potent format in international sales -- after ''Millionaire'' and possibly ''Big Brother,'' which has been an enormous hit in Holland, Germany, and most recently, Britain, and continues to sell well around the world despite results in the United States.</p>
        <p>The clout of the United States is still strong, if indirect, in the category of game shows and talk shows that the Europeans lump under the heading ''light entertainment.''</p>
        <p>David Lyle, the head of light entertainment for Pearson Television, one of the largest international distributors of programming, said, ''When the States get excited about this variety of show in all its forms, all of a sudden it gets fed back into Europe, and they get more excited about it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Silverman of the William Morris agency said that the ''second wave'' of these formats will start turning up on American television sets in January.</p>
        <p>''The performance of the second wave will be telling on the future of these formats,'' he said. ''Fox may have 'Boot Camp' on by November, and ABC will have 'The Mole' ready by January. They're already shooting it in France. Then 'Survivor II' hits at the end of January.''</p>
        <p>''Boot Camp'' sends a group of contestants through the rigors of Marine-style training; ''The Mole,'' puts a group of people through some scavenger-hunt type challenges, all of which are being undercut by an unknown mole-and-actor in the group.</p>
        <p>Waiting in the wings are second-wave formats like ''Public Property,'' recently bought by ABC from Pearson, in which six people turn their lives over for a month to the viewers, who tell them what to wear, what to eat, and maybe even what romantic interest to dump.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyle has a show from Australia he is looking to sell to a U.S. network, possibly Fox or WB, called ''The $20 Challenge,'' which transports three small-town twentysomethings to a big city, gives them $20 each and tells them to find food and shelter for three days -- all accompanied by cameras crews, of course.</p>
        <p>The Creative Artists Agency has hopes for a decades-old German format called ''Wetten Das'' -- loosely translated as ''Wanna Bet'' -- which alternates variety acts with oddball physical challenges. On one show a few years ago, Mikhail Gorbachev watched as a hugely overweight man in pajamas tried to see if he could squeeze into a tiny square in the stage. The man did.</p>
        <p>And John DeMol, whose Endemol Entertainment, the creator of ''Big Brother,'' owns more formats than almost any other European company, is ''100 percent sure'' he has another show that will ''work in the States.'' The show is ''Domino D-Day,'' in which more than 1.5 million dominos, set up in intricate patterns over three months by 85 students, are knocked down in a live 90-minute show. It was a big hit in Holland.</p>
        <p>Some American executives suggest that the preoccupation with formats may be a passing fad. Jeffrey Schlesinger, the president of Warner Brothers International Television, who has more than 20 years of experience making deals with foreign broadcasters, said: ''The format business is something that is very exciting right now. I would question how long it will last. I'm sure it's going to be cyclical like other things in our business.''</p>
        <p>But while the format fire rages, what all the shows are looking for is what ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' has already achieved: true global status. Mr. Smith of Celador is devoted enough to his show to have actually been moved to tears by the interaction of so many of his hosts. (Regis Philbin, the trademark American host, could not attend because he had a commitment to his morning talk show.)</p>
        <p>The ''Millionaire'' format dictates everything from set to lighting to music to those dark, solid-color clothes ensembles of the hosts. Pamela Wallin in Canada and Maria Elisa in Portugal are the only female hosts. Only Ms. Wallin made it for the team photo, standing out in an electric blue suit. ''We want mature men, for the most part,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It adds to their authority.''</p>
        <p>Some of the hosts were younger, including 27-year-old Duta Skirtladze of Georgia. His producer, Giorgi Khaburzania who is 24, said the show is a smash in his country as well, even though the prize, 20,000 laris, is the smallest in value of all those around the world: around $10,000. Still, that is a fortune in Georgia, he said. ''We are a poor country. To win 20,000 is very exciting.''</p>
        <p>But Yonas, the single-named host from Slovenia complained to Martin Nikodyn of Slovakia and Vladimir Cech of the Czech Republic, that his top prize of 10,000,000 sits (about $70,000) is not enough to inspire as much excitement. ''So I have to manufacture a lot of the drama,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith addressed many of the issues of concern to his hosts during a workshop for all the show's producers, where such things as how to improve the number of female contestants and what to do if a wrong answer is mistakenly established as the correct answer were addressed.</p>
        <p>One point was raised several times: very few countries have ever had a top prize winner. But in the United States six people have won $1 million.</p>
        <p>''America can certainly say it is still ahead of the rest of the world on that,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
