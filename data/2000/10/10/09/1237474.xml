        <p>The cart advanced slowly up the avenue, a small wooden statue of the Virgin Mary mounted atop it and hundreds of thousands of people straining at least to touch the rope that created a protected space around the image. Those lucky enough to grasp the thick cord held on tightly, their sweaty faces contorted by fatigue and fervor, as the procession meandered for eight hours to a basilica just three miles away.</p>
        <p>All week long the pilgrims have been streaming into this port city on  foot and by boat, bus and plane, coming from as far as 1,000 miles away  to take part in a ritual that has been a part of life in the Amazon for more than 200 years. Today, with the second Sunday of October having finally arrived, the Cirio de Nazare, the biggest religious festival in the country with the largest Roman Catholic population in the world, was once again celebrated here.</p>
        <p>''I dream all year of this day, when I can thank the Virgin for the favors she has granted me and renew my faith in God,'' said Rosilene Gouveia Aguiar, 31. She was marching with her husband and two small children, who were dressed as angels, complete with fluffy wings. ''This is always a sacred occasion for me, full of hope and joy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>To foreigners, Brazil often seems a bastion of either liberation theology or voodoo. But the Cirio may be the most striking example of what Ralph Dellacava of Columbia University, an expert on religion in Brazil, calls ''the force and continuing viability of a popular folk Catholicism'' in this sprawling nation of 175 million people. This folk Catholicism, he says,  ''is handed down from father to son and mother to daughter and creates a sense of community and a touchstone for tradition.''</p>
        <p>During recent Cirio observances,  the population of this sweltering city of one million near the mouth of the Amazon River has nearly doubled. The crowds and their energy and endurance recall Carnival, but the Cirio is an outpouring of religious devotion that resembles nothing so much as a giant mosh pit for the Virgin Mary. It includes pilgrims carrying heavy crosses or marching on their knees as penitence or in gratitude for blessings they fervently believe that she has bestowed upon them.</p>
        <p>Raimundo Nonato Correa de Magalhaes was one of them, having carried a 20-foot cross to Belem, whose name is Portuguese for Bethlehem, from his home in Castanhal, 50 miles away. He has performed the ritual for more than 20 years now to ''pay a promise'' in thanks for being able to buy a piece of land he had long wanted. Over the years his trek has become a tradition in which he is accompanied by neighbors and friends.</p>
        <p>The origins of the Cirio, like those of many other Latin American religious festivals, are a mixture of fact and legend difficult to untangle. In October 1700, a hunter and woodcutter named Placido de Souza, son of a Portuguese settler and an Indian woman, came across an 11-inch-high statue of Our Lady of Nazareth and an infant Jesus on the bank of what was then a creek but today is the site of the Basilica de Nazare, focal point of the celebrations here.</p>
        <p>He took the image home, but it is supposed to have mysteriously returned to the riverbank, where he found it again. He took it back to his simple cabin, only to have it disappear once more and turn up at the riverbank. When the governor of the province of Para heard of the miracle, he ordered the statue brought to his palace and placed under armed guard, but it soon vanished one last time, reappearing at the same spot.</p>
        <p>The adoration of the statue intensified over the years, and in 1793 the colonial governor authorized the first celebration of the Cirio, whose name refers to a type of devotional candle. The statue now paraded through the streets here is a replica, with the original kept at the basilica and removed only for the most special of occasions.</p>
        <p>But an equally important focus of the celebration is a sisal rope more than two inches thick and 1,300 feet long that is attached to the cart bearing the statue. Many of the faithful here believe that the rope transmits the divine energy of the Virgin of Nazareth and that by touching it they can attain a state of grace or properly thank her for favors granted.</p>
        <p>''Nowadays the cord is as venerated as the image of the Virgin,'' said Antonio Correa, a researcher at the Cirio Museum here. ''People want to touch the rope no matter what the physical toll, or to take home a piece of it if they can, as if it were a trophy.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the cord has been a source of conflict between church authorities and worshipers almost since it was first used in 1855 to pull the cart carrying the image of the Virgin out of the mud. In 1926, a new bishop here, offended by body contact between the sexes during the procession and hoping to modernize the observances, ordered the cord removed, but relented after street disturbances and political pressure.</p>
        <p>''The Cirio is something that emerged independently of the church hierarchy, and there has always been a tension between the objectives of the authorities and those of the people,'' said Heraldo Maues, who teaches social anthropology at the Federal University of Para here. ''The religious and civic authorities try to control the ceremonies for their own ends of evangelization and the promotion of tourism, but the people always have their own ideas and usually win out.''</p>
        <p>While the essence of the festival remains largely unchanged, the faithful have found new forms of expression that are quickly incorporated into ritual.</p>
        <p>Since the 1980's, for instance, the formal celebrations have begun on Saturday with a morning-long procession down the Amazon River that draws dozens of vessels decked out in balloons and bunting.</p>
        <p>Once the Sunday procession is over, it is also customary for the faithful to return home for a traditional meal of duck with yucca. Relatives and friends exchange gaily painted wooden toy versions of animals, boats, houses, cars and other objects, known collectively as miriti, after the palm tree from which they are carved.</p>
        <p>''This is like Christmas for us, and just as important,'' said Maria da Conceicao Contente, 60, who comes here every year from a small town a day's boat ride away. ''It's not just an expression of faith and hope that you wait and work for all year, but also an occasion for families to get together.''</p>
        <p>Such rituals and the intensity of religious fervor surrounding the Cirio are a reminder that ''the Middle Ages are still present among us and have not completely disappeared,''  Dr. Maues said. ''They can appear in practices, ideas and beliefs when least expected, and no matter who tries to contain such manifestations, I don't think they can, because the people continue to invent and create the legends and symbols they deem important.''</p>
