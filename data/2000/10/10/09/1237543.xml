        <p>Following are excerpts from yesterday's debate between New Jersey senatorial candidates Jon S. Corzine and Representative Bob Franks, as recorded by The New York Times. Tom Moran of The Star-Ledger was the moderator. More excerpts are available at The New York Times on the Web at www.nytimes.com.</p>
        <p>TOM MORAN -- Welcome to the first debate between the major candidates for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey. They are Democrat Jon Corzine, former chairman of the investment firm Goldman Sachs, who is seeking his first public office, and Republican Bob Franks, a member of Congress since his election in 1992 and former chairman of the state Republican Party.</p>
        <p>The debate is sponsored by The Star-Ledger. It's being broadcast on News 12 New Jersey, CN8 and C-Span. The candidates are competing for the seat held by Democrat Frank Lautenberg, who is retiring from the Senate after 18 years. . . .</p>
        <p>We'll skip opening statements and go directly to questions from our three-person panel. They are Ron Marsico of The Star-Ledger, Lynn Doyle of CN8, and Christopher King of News 12 New Jersey. Ron Marsico, let's begin with your question. The first goes to Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>RON MARSICO -- Mr. Corzine, yesterday the United Nations Security Council condemned Israel in a resolution for excessive force in the Gaza and the West Bank. The United States abstained. Do you agree with the United Nations action?</p>
        <p>JON CORZINE -- . . .</p>
        <p>I have the view that the United States voted properly by abstaining. I don't think the United Nations needs to be intervening in an internal matter, which I think is very clearly consistent with a history in the United Nations, not recognizing the rights and responsibilities of Israel to protect its own national security.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Mr. Franks?</p>
        <p>BOB FRANKS -- I think the vote by the United States was a mistake. I think it's most important that as we conduct our foreign policy that we stand as a reliable friend for our allies. We have no reliable ally in the Middle East more than the State of Israel. . . . We have no choice but to veto that type of anti-Israel resolution.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- The prime minister has said if the demonstrations don't settle down by Monday night that he'll allow his army to remove restraint. Is there a point at which you would say that's too much, Israel, we have to break company with you, those tactics go too far?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- The peace process is all about developing a secure and reliable peace for every country in that very dangerous region. The people of Israel have a right to go to work and live in peace. The Palestinians have a right, as well, to occupy portions of that land, and this negotiating is difficult and tenuous. But we can't allow violence to override the peacemaking process. Israel has a right to protect herself, and if Arafat will not stop the terror, then people are going to have to pay the consequences. . . .</p>
        <p>LYNN DOYLE -- Good morning, gentlemen. Congressman Franks, my first question to you is on the issue of abortion. Your position on the abortion plank of the Republican Party differs from the traditional Republicans in that you support a woman's right to choose in certain situations. Can you explain to us under what conditions you feel a woman, or perhaps even a girl, could end a pregnancy?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- I strongly support the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. I believe that in that process a woman and her physician and her clergyperson have the right, a woman ultimately, the right to make a decision as to what to do about her pregnancy.</p>
        <p>But having said that, I think it's a national disgrace that we have the reliance on abortion that we do. I think we need to work together as a community to reduce the need for abortions, and we need to do that by working together. I have supported certain restrictions, including a ban on partial-birth abortions, which in my judgment, are overwhelmingly medically unnecessary and represents the most horrendous medical procedure that I can think of. I view it as a form of infanticide.</p>
        <p>For 20 years I strongly supported parental notification laws. . .</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- I'm unequivocally a pro-choice candidate for the United States Senate. I believe strongly in Roe v. Wade. I believe that the primary issue is protecting the life and health of the mother, and I think these decisions are private decisions, ones that should be left to the choice of the woman, her doctor and the people in her family and those that she looks to for spiritual guidance. . . .</p>
        <p>CHRISTOPHER KING -- . . . Mr. Corzine, my first question is to you. You've proposed an ambitious plan to provide universal access to health care. At its core is a requirement that businesses provide coverage to their employees and cover most of the cost. Would that hurt small businesses, and is it politically possible?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Well, I think that it would not hurt small business because I would create a situation where the employee takes up part of the responsibility for paying for the insurance, with support on a means-tested basis for the employee. And I would work to encourage regional pools, which the federal government then would provide subsidies to. . . .</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- To me there's only one thing that's more unfortunate than an employee without health care insurance, and that's an employee without a job. If we mandate health coverage on all small businesses, even those that today are existing on the margin, we will cause a rapid increase in unemployment among those who are less skilled and may find it more difficult to get placed in a job elsewhere.</p>
        <p>I believe that it's important to give small businesses and those who are self-employed fair treatment under the tax code. . . .</p>
        <p>MORAN -- The Kaiser Family Foundation sponsored a study that looked at what impact change in the tax rules would have on expanding health insurance coverage and found that it would be less than a million additional people that would, under your proposal, would receive insurance. There are 45 million without it now. Is there something else you can propose, or is this problem just too big for us to solve? How else do we get to those other 44 million, let's say we do everything you suggest.</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- I don't believe that the answer exists in Hillary Clinton's universal health care program, which Jon talked about during the primary campaign. . . . By permitting pooling together, by permitting 100 percent deductibility for the self-employed as well as for those employees in a small business where the employer doesn't cover them, we can move to begin to close that gap.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- And Mr. Corzine, if small businesses do have to pay this bill, even with a pool you would set up and with a subsidy, they seem to take it quite seriously -- this is something that they consider a tremendous burden to them. How do you square that with your belief that it would be manageable?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Well, I think they have to understand that it is going to be a co-pay arrangement with the employees and there will be support for the employees based on means-testing, and that there will be substantial subsidizations to these regional pools that Congressman Franks is talking about, it's the same thing that I'm suggesting. If that's the case, the cost will be less, and frankly, the idea of using tax deductions for low-income workers who may not even be paying taxes, maybe even in an earned-income tax credit basis, is not going to provide the kind of access at health care that's going to make sense for a lot of the folks that work in these low-paying jobs.</p>
        <p>And the idea that this is going to cause unemployment I think is about like saying raising the minimum wage in 1996 was going to throw us into a recession. The fact is the economy has continued to grow, grow very effectively. . . .</p>
        <p>MORAN -- You supported an increase in the minimum wage, didn't you, Mr. Franks?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- I did, both back in 1996 and again this year to increase it further by a dollar over the course of two years.  . . .</p>
        <p>MARSICO -- Congressman Franks, in 1995, you were the only member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation to vote for a revision in the Clean Water Act, an action that environmentalists considered so awful they dubbed it the dirty water act. In 1998 the environmentalists, however, endorsed you. This time they've endorsed your opponent Mr. Corzine. Have you had a change of heart on the environment, and if you had it to do all over again, would you vote differently in that 1995 bill?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- I'm proud of my record protecting New Jersey's precious environment. I'm proud particularly of the fact that just two years ago both the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters stepped into a very competitive congressional election involving my candidacy and both of those organizations endorsed me. I'm proud of that record. . . .</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Well, I think the classification of the dirty water bill speaks for itself. It took away 80 percent -- protection, federal protection of 80 percent of the wetlands in New Jersey. It cut back on funding. It made for the E.P.A. and OSHA, took away standards and enforcement standards, and was a serious denigration of our environmental laws. And these kinds of actions have continued with votes that the congressman continues with -- supports dredging of the Delaware River, which environmentalists are very, very much opposed to. . . . Vote after vote on funding for E.P.A. and environmental agencies are missing in Congressman Franks's record. That's why the Environmental Federation, the Sierra Club, I think, have turned to a positive view about my record and what I will stand for. . .</p>
        <p>DOYLE -- Mr. Corzine, I'd like to address the so-called 800-pound gorilla that has dominated this campaign, and quite frankly, that's your money -- both your personal fortune and the amount of money's that been spent on this campaign. So far it's a record-breaking $50 million, as compared to the roughly $3 million spent by Congressman Franks. He's accused you of trying to buy the state of New Jersey because you don't have a public record on which to stand. Can you explain to us why you'd need to spend so much money to secure this seat?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Well, first of all, I'd make the point that elections are about ideas. If people stand for a prescription drug benefit for seniors, if they stand for registration and licensing of all guns, if they stand with protecting and securing Social Security and locking up and making sure that it's not privatized over a period of time, I think those ideas are what voters will ultimately pull the lever when the go into the voting booth about. I think there is an assumption that voters aren't smart enough to determine who it is that will represent their interests best.</p>
        <p>We were -- we do not have 23 years of experience in political life. I have a very public record in my private life. I've been very active in my community. I have a foundation which I've revealed almost everything about. People know the kinds of things I've stood for. I've spent 18 months being very clear about the positions that I'll fight. . .</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Mr. Franks?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- Jon, you know, the idea that's a center focus here is the idea that you're trying to buy a seat in the United States Senate. That's the lens through which the people of New Jersey are looking at this contest. That's why interest exists across the country. Because you've shattered every all-time spending record to try to buy a seat in the United States Senate. . . .</p>
        <p>I admire success you've had on Wall Street. But I wish, in order to tell people where all this money is coming from, that today you'd tell us that you're going to disclose finally your complete and unabridged income tax returns for the last 10 years. . . .</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Mr. Franks, can I ask you on that question, which has been a nagging question for the entire campaign -- on your tax returns, Mr. Corzine -- what is it that you're looking for that you can't find in the Senate disclosure forms? Can you tell us the kind of thing that would raise an alarm with you, the type of investment you would consider out of bounds? Are you worried he's invested in child labor or, you know, trades with Iraq? Give us some specifics, and then I'll ask Mr. Corzine, can you reassure us on those specifics?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- Tom, as I understand it, Goldman Sachs owns hundreds if not thousands of companies. And back in the days when it was a partnership, before last year each one of the partners had to detail their involvement in those investments. But now that Goldman's gone public, Mr. Corzine merely declares on his personal financial disclosure form his interest in Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>What we don't know is all the companies that Goldman owns. What are their past practices? I candidly don't know specifically what I'm looking at or for, but I think the people of New Jersey have a right to look at the totality of the personal finances of someone who's seeking one of the most important positions of public trust anywhere in this country.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- If you could name certain things that would bother you, I'll ask Mr. Corzine, do your investments come from that certain thing ----</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- No, Tom, this is a threshold issue. Either you're going to come clean with the people of New Jersey and put it all out for us to review -- I'm not going to play the game of is this in it or is that in it. That would be entirely misleading and disingenuous. Let's -- it's a threshold decision. Do you believe in full, unabridged public disclosure, or are you going to try to hide it?</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Mr. Corzine, you've said you have an agreement with your partners at Goldman Sachs not to release certain information. Should that agreement take precedence over the understandable concern of a lot of New Jersey voters that you are buying this election?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Tom, it's a legal, binding agreement. I think that people in New Jersey have the common sense enough to know that I shouldn't start my public career by breaking a legal agreement. It makes no sense for one to sign contracts and commit yourself, just as I am going to commit myself to fulfill the kinds of pledges that I want to make trying to solve the problems of the people New Jersey would like to see dealt with, by breaking a contract.</p>
        <p>And we have gone beyond the letter of the law by releasing exactly what my assets are, what the range of income that comes from them. I have put up summaries that have been certified by public accountants of what my 1040's are back to 1996. We have released the tax returns of my foundation, which are not subject to these issues, listed everything that we have given contributions to right up through September. We have pledged that we will put my assets in a blind trust if elected. And I will release my tax returns once I am free of these confidentiality agreements for the years going forward.</p>
        <p>And it is very clear, I think, that if anyone wants to review any of this material, it's on my Web site: www.votecorzine.org, and people can make their own assessment of whether I have been fully disclosed about what my financial ----</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Do you think it was a mistake to make that agreement, given that you're making a run at public office?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- When you're in a partnership, we have -- I have signed an agreement, starting in 1980, every other year, right up to the end of my career at Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Mr. Franks, what about that? Are you asking him to break a legal agreement?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- You know, Tom, this is becoming a bipartisan tradition in New Jersey. When you run for statewide office you release your tax returns. Senator Torricelli, who's here in the audience today, releases his. Governor Whitman releases hers. Jim McGreevey, the last Democratic candidate for governor, released his. For the last 10 years I've released mine. It just seems to me that if we're going to deal with this issue of public cynicism and public mistrust of elected officials in both political parties, we need to go the extra mile to engender their trust and their confidence in the institutions of the government.</p>
        <p>I don't think Jon's purposefully trying to cause greater cynicism or disrespect for the government, but unintended consequences are going to flow from this decision. People are going to question this entire political system.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Let's go to the next question. Chris?</p>
        <p>KING -- Congressman Franks, in the presidential debate last week, Al Gore criticized the tax cut proposed by George W. Bush, saying it was too large and that more than 40 percent of the dollars would go to the richest 1 percent of the population. Do you share those concerns, and would you vote for the Bush tax cut package?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- I do share some of those concerns, and I would not vote for the Bush tax cut package as it is today. I'm concerned that it would crowd out other compelling priorities. This nation should first meet the obligations that we've already pledged. We need to save Social Security. We need to save Medicare. We need to continue to pay down the national debt. We need to first honor the commitments we've already made.</p>
        <p>Now, having said that, I want to attack immediately the marriage penalty tax. That marriage penalty imposes an obligation on some 800,000 New Jersey couples by forcing them to pay $1,400 per year in higher federal taxes. Mr. Corzine says he wants marriage penalty relief, but the bill that he supports wouldn't give essentially any relief here in New Jersey . . . Let's enact the marriage penalty relief bill now, and get rid of one of the most onerous features of our current tax code.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Mr. Corzine?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Well, this is one of the most important issues for comparison of Congressman Franks and myself. Last -- this month, in New Jersey Business Week -- or Monthly -- he proposed that we eliminate the capital gains tax. He talked about across-the-board tax cuts. He talked about the marriage penalty proposal that he's talked about, which actually is a new way of providing tax cuts for high-income folks, in addition to the folks that do deserve marriage penalty relief, and an elimination of the inheritance tax. If you add all those up and just divide by two what Governor Bush's proposal is with regard to tax cuts on an across-the-board basis, you come up to 1.8 trillion in tax cuts. That will foreclose anyone from having the ability to invest in our education, protect our environment, our health care, shore up Medicare, all of the things that I think people want to see us invest in. . .</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Just for the record, are you for eliminating the capital gains tax?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- As a long-term policy objective, we should reduce the tax rate on capital gains. We still have one of the highest rates on taxation on capital gains anywhere in the industrialized world. It will help us create more jobs and economic growth and prosperity if we work to continue to reduce the tax on capital gains.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Do want to address the question of distribution?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Well first of all, the statement in the magazine written by Bob is eliminate the capital gains tax. The view that I take is that we should have targeted tax cuts including, by the way, with respect to addressing a number of the factors with regard to the marriage penalty. I both want to raise and equalize the standard deduction for married couples and I also want to raise the top of the 15 percent tax bracket will take care of that $40,000 couple that Bob is talking about.</p>
        <p>I believe that we need to take careful aim at where we do have targeted tax cuts, working for long-term care, earned income tax credit expansion at the lower end where people are struggling to make ends meet. . . .</p>
        <p>KING -- Mr. Corzine, aside from universal access to health care and long-term care, you propose access to universal preschool and higher education. How much will all this cost? Can we afford it? Can you name a significant social program that you might oppose?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Well, I'll tell you one thing it won't cost is the estimates that I see on Bob Franks's Web site. We're talking about hope scholarships which provide access for middle-income families to higher education. We've used the same assumptions that Georgia used to start out, of the number of high school graduates, the number of people who apply to colleges, the number of people who go to colleges, maintain B averages over a period of time. And we come out with a $2.2 billion program on an annual basis. Congressman Franks is saying that will cost 58 billion. Sometimes I think that's one of the reasons that maybe people are cynical about political debates.</p>
        <p>Similarly when I'm talking about preschool I am talking about fully funding out Head Start. Making sure that the 55 percent of the kids who are eligible for Head Start actually have access at it. That'll cost about $5 billion a year and Congressman Franks is talking that this will cost about, if I read his website correctly, $38 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Just like all the other assumptions with regard to a lot of my programs that The Star-Ledger has gone through and scrubbed down completely, come out with 110, he's says they're 756 billion, I'd say are $60 billion programs.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Mr. Franks?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- Tom, I was really looking forward to see which Jon Corzine was going to show up for today's debate. Whether it was the Jon Corzine who went before the Democratic primary voters this spring and declared, with $21 million worth of TV spots, universal long-term care, universal higher education. There were no conditions attached. There were no caveats. It would've taken just about a half a second to add the word ''access,'' universal access.</p>
        <p>But that's not what Jon chose to do. He went way beyond that and promised universal higher education and universal long-term care. Only now that I guess his handlers have described to him just how extraordinarily expensive that would be, he's regrouped. Now he's got universal access proposals.</p>
        <p>In higher education it means you have to now maintain a B average. You have to choose a state school. And most importantly, the state will have to agree to fund fully half the cost.</p>
        <p>Jon, I don't know, was it you in the primary or is this you today?</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Do -- go ahead and answer that.</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Bob, the programs that I proposed in the primary are the same programs that I am now talking to the voters of New Jersey about. Same Web site discussion. No alterations, no changes. The same discussions we had in the primary with Governor Florio and the debates we had there are the same ones we're talking about today.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- Let me take a closer look at one of those. Long-term care, universal long-term care, which Congressman Franks says would cost over $500 billion dollars a year.</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Five hundred and fifty.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- O.K. And you have a proposal that would cost two-and-a-half?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Two-and-a-half billion unless we have a refundable piece for low-income Americans, which if we have the budget room, I would implement. As in all of the programs I've talked about, I would not spend us back into deficit spending, which would be the case if we implemented all these tax cuts their people are talking about. And I want to make sure we execute these in an affordable manner.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- I want to follow up on his point though, that when you say I propose universal long-term care -- or health care, other things -- but to look at long-term care, the 2.6 billion would finance a modest tax cut that Clinton has proposed. Correct? That's not exactly universal --</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- The refundable piece would make major inroads and to people who have low income. And I've also, if you read further than just going through the tax credit, we've talked about trying to implement programs that would allow for the prepayment of life insurance to purchase long-term care. We've talked about the ability to possibly restructure pension funds to also support that. And tax deductibility with regard to the purchase of it.</p>
        <p>So it's not just money. There are a whole series of steps that can lead to effective long-term care.</p>
        <p>Right now, we have a universal long-term care program developing. It's people spending themselves down into Medicaid and allowing the most expensive source of funding for long-term care developing through the Medicaid system.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- When you say universal preschool, that's different than an expansion of Head Start, isn't it? Because not everybody ----</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Head Start -- if Head Start were made available to everyone, then there would be access at -- for everyone that met the economic means test -- then there would be access at universal preschool.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- And your health care plan you would expect, of the 45 million who don't have health insurance now, I understand you expect roughly half of them to get insurance through your plan?</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- It is voluntary, so it will not necessarily lead to universal absolute coverage but it will provide universal access, particularly when you put it together with expanding CHIPS -- Children's Health Insurance Program -- not only for the kids that are available, but to the parents, and also, including offering Medicare to people 55 to 65.</p>
        <p>MORAN -- O.K. Mr. Franks?</p>
        <p>FRANKS -- Tom, this is unbelievable to me. Universal long-term care for $2.5 billion. You know, it's not me, Jon, it's the newspapers in New Jersey and New York who've looked at your program and made the assessment that it represents the largest expansion in the federal government in history. Everybody in America knows you've got the most liberal agenda running anywhere in the country today, and the most expensive. You say you won't backslide into deficits. You will push us back into deficits, and I want to honor the commitments that we've already made to Social Security, to Medicare, to paying down the debt, and yes, to getting rid of the marriage penalty tax. In my judgment, you're going to crowd out those options by these huge new spending programs that only now you're trying to scuttle back to try to see if you can reconfigure and make them sound as if they're affordable. But Jon, they're not. There's only 100 cents in every dollar. I think you would have appreciated that from Wall Street, but I've had to make the tough decisions to finally balance the federal budget.</p>
        <p>And what you also have said, in the Democratic primary, was there will be times when we'll have to engage in some modest level of deficit spending. Jon, government doesn't know moderate levels of deficit spending. You break that balanced budget and we're going to go in a very slippery slope steep down.</p>
        <p>CORZINE -- Tom, I have pledged over and over on the campaign trail that we will not go into deficit spending, unless we enter into a recession, when the automatic stabilizers in our economy for unemployment insurance and other things kick in to cause that. I will not vote for any bill that will put us into deficit. And furthermore, I won't vote for any tax increase, except possibly with regard to tobacco taxes, in the first six years that I am in the United States Senate. And the whole idea that we're going to have $1.8 trillion in tax cuts -- and if Congressman Franks follows the leader the way he has in the House, we are going to have even more tax cuts that are going to leave us with no ability to pay down the debt, no ability to invest in our educational system, no ability to do the things that I think the voters of New Jersey would like to see us invest in. Investing actually will lead to progress and prosperity as we go forward, and I think it's absolutely essential that we have a sound, prudent fiscal policy. I know what real numbers are. I've been working with them for 25 years in the private sector, putting together budgets, making them work, showing up and making sure that you're held accountable for them. I'm talking about real numbers.</p>
