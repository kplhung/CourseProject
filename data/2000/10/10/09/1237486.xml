        <p>In what could represent a new way to save endangered species, scientists at a Massachusetts biotechnology company said yesterday that they had cloned an endangered Asian gaur and implanted the resulting embryo into a cow in Iowa. The baby gaur, an oxlike creature that is native to India and Southeast Asia, is expected to be born next month.</p>
        <p>If the birth of the gaur is successful, it would represent the first cloning of an endangered species and the first cloned animal to use another species as a surrogate mother. Scientists say the technique could not only help preserve endangered species but also revive species that have already become extinct.</p>
        <p>The company, Advanced Cell Technology, of Worcester, Mass.,  said yesterday that it had received permission from the government of Spain to clone the already extinct bucardo mountain goat, using cells collected from the last goat before she died earlier this year. The company is also looking at cloning giant pandas using black bears as surrogate mothers and frozen cells from Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, pandas at the National Zoo in Washington that have already died.</p>
        <p>But the technique, which seems right out of ''Jurassic Park,'' is raising ethical questions. Some conservationists fear that cloning would detract from other, less costly efforts at preserving habitat. And some say it is still not known whether an animal raised by a mother of a different species will be able to thrive in the wild.</p>
        <p>''It's more like an amusement park version of the species rather than the wild species,'' said Kent Redford, director of biodiversity analysis and coordination at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. ''We want to preserve a whole lot more than the genetic material,'' he added, saying species should be preserved in their natural environments. ''That can't be reproduced in some Frankenstein lab.''</p>
        <p>Robert P. Lanza, vice president for medical and scientific development at Advanced Cell Technology, said cloning would help reverse damage to wildlife habitat by people. He urged zoos and wildlife officials to begin collecting and freezing tissue samples of endangered species. ''For a few dollars of electricity you can preserve the genes of all the pandas in China,'' Mr. Lanza said.</p>
        <p>He also said cloning was not likely to work on species that had been extinct for a long time because it would be difficult or impossible to find intact DNA. ''You're certainly not going to be seeing dinosaurs in your backyard any time soon,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To create the gaur, scientists took a skin cell from a recently deceased gaur and fused it with a cow's egg from which the chromosomes, containing the cow's genetic material, had been removed. The DNA of the gaur commandeered the egg, which grew into a gaur embryo. The embryo was implanted in the womb of a cow serving as a surrogate mother. The baby, which will be named Noah, should be an exact genetic copy of the gaur from which the skin cell was obtained. The procedure was reported yesterday in The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>Previously, many scientists thought such cross-species cloning would be impossible because the DNA of the cloned animal would not be able to interact properly with the rest of the egg cell.</p>
        <p>The technique failed many more times than it succeeded. The scientists created several hundred embryos, but only 81 grew to the stage where they could be implanted. Some 42 were implanted in 32 cows, but only eight cows became pregnant. The fetuses were extracted from two cows for examination, and five cows suffered spontaneous abortions, leaving only one cow that is still pregnant.</p>
        <p>Based on the examination of the fetuses, Dr. Lanza said, the gaurs seemed to be normal, not crosses between cows and gaurs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lanza said cows were used as egg donors and surrogate mothers because there are so few gaurs left that it would be unethical to round up wild female gaurs and subject them to the treatments needed to extract eggs and implant embryos. And for creatures that are already extinct, he said, there would be no choice but to use other species as egg donors and surrogate mothers.</p>
        <p>There have been cases of animals of one species being born to surrogate mothers of another species, such as a house cat giving birth to an African wildcat. But in these cases the implanted embryos were not the result of cloning.</p>
        <p>Advanced Cell Technology, which is trying to use cloning for medicine and agriculture, has set up a nonprofit foundation to carry on species preservation work, since it is not expected to turn into a big business. The work, assisted by various university scientists, is described in a paper in the current issue of the journal Cloning and in an article in the November issue of Scientific American.</p>
