        <p>KUZON-Edward. Of North Miami Beach, FL on October 6, 2000 in his 90th year. Beloved husband of the late Sylvia (Leff), wife of 65 years. Devoted father and father-in-law of Ronald and Susan of Scarsdale, NY. Loving grandfather of Tiffany, Jillian, Joshua, Ariel and Aaron. Born in Kiev, Russia, he came to America as a young child and settled in Springfield, MA, and eventually in Longmeadow, MA. Together with his wife, Sylvia, and her brother Morris H. Leff, they founded the Bradlees department store chain which was sold in 1962 to the Stop and Shop Companies of Braintree, MA. After a brief retirement he partnered with Jacob Bernstein of Longmeadow, MA, in the formation of a consumer packaging company which was sold in 1988. He was a major supporter and contributor to all Jewish philanthropies and the greater community at large. He never forgot the opportunities that were afforded to him as a result of his American citizenship, and worked for the eventual freedom for all of his family that remained behind in the Soviet Union. He always believed that ''if you take care of the inside, the inside will take care of the outside.'' The funeral and burial were in Springfield, MA on Sunday, October 8, 2000.</p>
