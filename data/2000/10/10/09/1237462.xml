        <p>Kozmo.com, the Web retailer that promises urban deliveries in less than an hour, is close to an agreement to buy its archival, Urbanfetch.com, according to executives close to the negotiations.</p>
        <p>The two rapid-delivery e-tailers, which have held private talks in fits and starts over the last several months, finally agreed in principle to a deal last week, according to the executives. They said the companies hope to make an announcement by the end of the week.</p>
        <p>If the deal gels, it would be the end of a bitter battle between the two dot-coms that sell everything from sushi to Palm hand-held computers, and deliver them quickly to urban customers by bicycle couriers. The two companies have shared harsh words and even a stinging lawsuit: Kozmo sought an injunction against Urbanfetch last year before its rival even started business, contending that it stole Kozmo's business model. The case was eventually settled out of court in December.</p>
        <p>The proposed acquisition comes amid a wave of consolidation by Internet companies as they struggle to reach profitability. The so-called ''last-mile delivery'' business of Kozmo and Urbanfetch has been rife with deal-making. This summer, the Internet grocery-delivery site Webvan acquired HomeGrocer for $1.2 billion.</p>
        <p>A combined Komzo-Urbanfetch would hope to eke out savings through job cuts, both in the back office and among its couriers, the executives said. They also warned that the deal could still be abandoned, considering that talks between Kozmo and Urbanfetch have faltered at the 11th hour before.</p>
        <p>While the exact terms of the deal were not divulged, the executives said that itwould be done entirely in stock. Neither company is publicly traded, so Kozmo would pay Urbanfetch in private equity by giving it a percentage of ownership in the combined company. If the market for Internet initial public offerings turns up again, the new company would hope to go public within the next year, the executives added.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Urbanfetch declined to comment. A spokesman for Kozmo could not be reached.</p>
        <p>Executives of both companies spent part of last week in London reviewing the books on Urbanfetch's London operation, which was started this year and which would serve as a beachhead for expansion internationally into Europe and Asia. Kozmo, the larger of the two, operates in 11 cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Portland, Ore., San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington. Urbanfetch operates in New York and London.</p>
        <p>Both companies have struggled in recent months as the dot-com sector lost its luster and investors have started to demand profits. Kozmo recently announced it was laying off 275 employees, or 10 percent of its staff, hoping to stem losses. Urbanfetch imposed a minimum of $10 an order, dropped video rentals from its offerings and cut its marketing budget by 70 percent. Kozmo also instituted a minimum order, of $5.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to value Kozmo or Urbanfetch because both are privately held. Kozmo has raised more than $250 million in financing from a blue-chip roster of investors including Amazon.com, which made a $60 million infusion, and Chase Venture Capital Associates, Columbia TriStar, DreamWorks SKG, Flatiron Partners, Liberty Media, Oak Investment Partners, Softbank, Starbucks Coffee, 20th Century Fox, Universal Studios and Warner Brothers.</p>
        <p>Kozmo tried to go public in March, hoping to raise $150 million, but pulled the offering in April when the Nasdaq turned on the Internet sector. As of Dec. 31, 1999, the company had lost $27.3 million, according to the statement Kozmo filed when it intended to go public.</p>
        <p>Kozmo is committed to paying $150 million over the next five years to Starbucks for allowing Kozmo to use the coffee outlets as drop-off points for movie rentals.</p>
        <p>Much less is known about Urbanfetch's financial state because it never filed to go public.</p>
        <p>When Kozmo sued Urbanfetch, it contended that Ross Stevens, Urbanfetch's founder, stole the idea for an instant delivery e-tailer after Joseph Park, Kozmo's founder, sought money from him. Mr. Stevens at the time was working for a venture capital firm called Integrity Capital Management. The lawsuit contended that Mr. Stevens saw the Kozmo business plan and immediately began seeking to start a rival firm.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Crain's New York Business, Mr. Stevens and the two other founders of Urbanfetch.com, had harsh words about Kozmo.</p>
        <p>''The only real threat to Silicon Alley: a belief by some companies that they can monopolize parts of the Web and prevent competition by starting baseless, but well-timed, lawsuits against lesser-funded competitors,'' they wrote. ''Does Kozmo really believe that they 'own' the idea of ordering goods over the Internet and rapidly delivering them to customers' homes?''</p>
