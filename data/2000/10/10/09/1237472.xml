        <p>Ten months after President Fernando de la Rua took power promising to jump-start a depressed economy and cleanse a political system corroding from corruption and public distrust, his government is in crisis for doing neither.</p>
        <p>The Argentine economy remains in the doldrums and a federal judge is investigating whether members of his cabinet paid bribes to up to 11 senators to pass a new labor code. And with the resignation of his vice president, Carlos Alvarez, on Friday, a day after a shake-up of his cabinet, Mr. de la Rua is scrambling to salvage his coalition government.</p>
        <p>The president, who goes by the nickname ''the pacifier,'' met reporters on Saturday dressed informally in an ascot and suede jacket, projecting a sense of calm.</p>
        <p>''The vice president resigned, and that is an important event,'' Mr. de la Rua conceded. ''I lament that, but the president is in charge and the president continues exercising power. There is no institutional or governmental crisis.''</p>
        <p>Mr. de la Rua's words of reassurance came as his standing in opinion polls is slipping badly, international investors are growing increasingly anxious about Argentina's ability to pay its debts and his intelligence chief is under scrutiny in the bribery investigation.</p>
        <p>The Argentine press, which granted Mr. de la Rua a long honeymoon after his election last October, is punishing the administration with daily depictions of paralysis and disorder.</p>
        <p>''The resignation of Carlos Alvarez as vice president has sown a profound crisis in the governing alliance,'' said an editorial published today in the country's largest-circulation daily, Clarin, ''which has deep repercussions for the country's political life and probably the economy as well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez's resignation came in disagreement with the cabinet changes, in which the president retained two high-level officials implicated in the bribery scandal.</p>
        <p>One, Labor Minister Alberto Flamarique, was promoted to presidential chief of staff, but he resigned from the government after Mr. Alvarez's departure.</p>
        <p>Former President Raul Alfonsin, the leader of Mr. de la Rua's centrist Radical Party, is trying to persuade Mr. Alvarez, of the social democratic Frepaso Party, to remain allied with the government by becoming formal leader of the governing Alianza coalition. But in comments to reporters on Saturday, Mr. Alvarez appeared ready to become a leading critic of the administration until there is a sweeping investigation of government and Senate corruption.</p>
        <p>''There is a deep moral crisis in Argentina,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''The government weakens itself when it does not do what the society demands. It will further weaken itself if it does not take decisive action into what happened in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>As leader of Frepaso, which is allied in the government with Mr. de la Rua's Radicals, Mr. Alvarez was more influential than any other Argentine vice president in modern times. He says he will remain active in politics, and he should be in a strong position to influence Mr. de la Rua's policies or break up the governing alliance altogether.</p>
        <p>For now, the alliance appears intact. In a sign of unity on Saturday, Mr. de la Rua appeared arm-in-arm with Social Development Minister Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a close ally of the former vice president, at a ceremony honoring the Argentine Olympic team.</p>
        <p>But leaks to the local press show that there is much grumbling inside the government. Unnamed officials in the Anti-Corruption Office, a unit intended to clean up the government, were reported in today's newspapers to be complaining that the appointment of Jorge de la Rua, the president's brother, as justice minister hurt the government's credibility in legal affairs.</p>
        <p>Others in the coalition questioned the qualifications of the new labor minister, Patricia Bullrich, and privately wondered how the president could retain his friend Fernando de Santibanes as director of intelligence and the second-most-powerful official in the government when he is being investigated.</p>
        <p>Mr. de la Rua's political fortunes, pollsters and political consultants say, will probably rise or fall depending on the performance of the Argentine economy, South America's second largest. Since taking office, Mr. de la Rua has followed a tack of raising taxes and cutting spending to reduce an expanding budget deficit. But unemployment has risen and consumer spending is stagnant.</p>
        <p>After declining 3 percent last year, the economy is now expected to grow less than 2 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Much of the reason for the mediocre economic performance has been beyond the government's control. Prices for soybeans, wheat and other agricultural commodities have lagged. A scare that foot-and-mouth disease may have returned to Argentina has cut deeply into beef exports.</p>
        <p>With the Argentine peso pegged to a strong dollar and the euro weakening, Argentine exports have lost competitiveness in Europe. And since Brazil devalued its currency last year, many Argentine companies have transplanted their operations to Brazil to take advantage of lower production costs.</p>
        <p>A twist in fortunes is possible, economists say, and an Argentine recovery could be sudden and strong next year. But any further tightening of interest rates by the United States would strengthen the peso along with the dollar, further depressing Argentine exports.</p>
        <p>Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea spent much of the weekend reassuring Wall Street analysts and international bankers that the government would not budge from its policies of cutting its deficit to decrease interest rates.</p>
        <p>But if economic growth does not resume soon, some economists warn, pressures will rise for the government to reverse its tight spending policies.</p>
