        <p>EVENTS</p>
        <p>Play Time  As concerts go, one scheduled for Sunday is no shrinking violet: it will have some 2,000 performers, 200 sites and an expected live audience in excess of 100,000, plus 300,000 watching on television or listening on radio. The event is ''Pipes Spectacular! -- World's Largest Organ Concert,'' the American Guild of Organists' nationwide celebration of the pipe organ. The New York City chapter of the guild will take part when seven of its members play the newly refurbished organ at the Church of the Heavenly Rest, Fifth Avenue and 90th Street, at 6:30 p.m. Information: (212) 870-2310.</p>
        <p>That's Life  ''A painter can say all he wants to with fruit or flowers or even clouds,'' Edouard Manet (1832-1883) once said. Although celebrated for the technical innovation of figure paintings like ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe,'' Manet devoted some 80 paintings, roughly a fifth of his output, to still life. Beginning today, more than 35 of these works, many rarely shown, go on view through Jan. 7 at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris in what is described as the first major survey of this aspect of his oeuvre. Organized by the museum and the American Federation of Arts, ''Manet: The Still-Life Paintings'' will be seen at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore from Jan. 28 through April 22. Information: 011-331-40-49-48-14.</p>

        <p>Isle of Films  Searching for movies now that the New York Film Festival has ended? No need to suffer. Coming up are five days of screenings of more than 100 features, documentaries and short films, including 23 New York premieres. The event is the Eighth Annual Hamptons International Film Festival, beginning on Wednesday and ending on Sunday in East Hampton, Sag Harbor and Westhampton. Information: (631) 324-4600.</p>
        <p>Perfect Worlds  Although the word utopia was coined by Sir Thomas More in the 16th century, the longing for an ideal world has characterized mankind since time immemorial. Beginning on Saturday, the New York Public Library will address this subject in ''Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World.'' Organized jointly with the Bibliotheque Nationale de France and continuing through Jan. 27, this major exhibition includes some 550 objects. Highlights include the first edition of More's ''Utopia,'' the Declaration of Independence in Thomas Jefferson's hand and a reproduction of the robot used in Fritz Lang's film ''Metropolis.'' Information: (212) 869-8089.</p>
