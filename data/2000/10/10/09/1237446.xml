        <p>Although the Cleveland Orchestra concluded the season-opening series at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday and Thursday in typically superb fashion, several things seemed strangely out of joint. In addition, that is, to the right shoulder of Christoph von Dohnanyi, who soldiered on as the orchestra's conductor despite the dislocation days before.</p>
        <p>First, there was considerable preoccupation, at least among listeners in the area dominated by music professionals, with problems at the hall: the recent resignations of three respected members of the staff and reports of widespread dissatisfaction, bordering on revolt, with the leadership of Franz Xaver Ohnesorg as executive director. And, as on Tuesday, opening night, the audiences were sparse compared with  those that usually rise to the bracing challenges of Mr. Dohnanyi's programming in New York.</p>

        <p>Although the Cleveland Orchestra concluded the season-opening series at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday and Thursday in typically superb fashion, several things seemed strangely out of joint. In addition, that is, to the right shoulder of Christoph von Dohnanyi, who soldiered on as the orchestra's conductor despite the dislocation days before.</p>
        <p>First, there was considerable preoccupation, at least among listeners in the area dominated by music professionals, with problems at the hall: the recent resignations of three respected members of the staff and reports of widespread dissatisfaction, bordering on revolt, with the leadership of Franz Xaver Ohnesorg as executive director. And, as on Tuesday, opening night, the audiences were sparse compared with  those that usually rise to the bracing challenges of Mr. Dohnanyi's programming in New York.</p>
        <p>Moreover, many of those who did attend on Wednesday fled during the last work, Hans Werner Henze's Requiem, some after each movement. (It's good that there were only nine.)</p>
        <p>Cleveland audiences have largely come to embrace Mr. Dohnanyi's well-judged adventures. But even here, in a big, colorful display of an idiom from the early 90's that was little more strenuous than Varese's in the 20's, they can evidently be too heady for an audience of New York sophisticates. And in such cases, New Yorkers respond with unparalleled rudeness, climbing over neighbors and clomping up aisles while others strain to hear the music.</p>
        <p>Whatever happened to the valuable tradition of staying put, if only out of respect for a spectacular and committed performance, letting resentments fester to the limit and booing lustily at the end in the full courage of hard-earned conviction?</p>
        <p>Finally, a certain air of distraction seemed to reach even this most disciplined and professional of orchestras. In the Henze, a series of sacred concertos featuring piano and trumpet, it was noticed a minute or so into the piece that Joela Jones, the orchestra's pianist, was not onstage, unsummoned from a dressing room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dohnanyi, a stickler for detail who would undoubtedly have noticed the problem sooner if he had not been grappling with his physical problem, took the gaffe in good humor (onstage, at least). He cued the absent soloist, dryly noting, ''We miss the pianist,'' and restarted with all hands on deck.</p>
        <p>For all of that, the performances were excellent. In big, brawling works, whether Varese's ''Ameriques'' last season or the Henze here, Mr. Dohnanyi and the orchestra are sure to provide a well-made noise. Ms. Jones, once arrived, proved deft, and Michael Sachs, the principal trumpeter, played brilliantly.</p>
        <p>William Preucil took on a more daunting task on Wednesday, playing the violin solo in Arvo Part's ''Fratres,'' which is closely identified with the supreme virtuoso of the day, Gidon Kremer. To say that even in this circumstance Mr. Preucil satisfied fully is high praise indeed, and the rest of the strings laid down a gorgeous blanket of warmth for him.</p>
        <p>The strings then held the stage in a sinewy performance of Beethoven's ''Grosse Fuge'' as arranged of old by Felix Weingartner. They showed, as this orchestra so often does, that a harmonic shift played with perfect focus at the limit of audibility can pack as big a punch as, for example, the ones shouted to the heavens at the end of Mr. Henze's Requiem.</p>
        <p>On Thursday the new work, Magnus Lindberg's ''Cantigas,'' came first, affording listeners no easy escape. And here, too, with glacially shifting blocks of harmony giving rise to explosions of strident color, the orchestra played splendidly.</p>
        <p>Dagmar Peckova, a Czech mezzo-soprano with a dark, heavy tone where litheness was needed, seemed an odd choice for many of Luciano Berio's ''Folk Songs'' and sang flat in a couple. But she finished strongly in the ''Azerbaijan Love Song.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dohnanyi ended with Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony. As Yevgeny Mravinsky used to do with the Leningrad Philharmonic, he inspired in the performers a fearsome intensity that evoked both fire and ice. No one left early.</p>
