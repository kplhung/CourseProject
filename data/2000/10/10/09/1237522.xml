        <p>Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has been working on the campaign pro bono since June 1999. The goal is to encourage marketers to advertise more by offering examples of brands and products built by advertising.</p>
        <p>The initial three ads in the campaign feature the Coca-Cola and Sunkist logos along with the Energizer battery bunny; in all three instances, the brand names are replaced by the word ''Advertising'' rendered in their familiar typefaces. The campaign theme is: ''Advertising. The way great brands get to be great brands.''</p>
