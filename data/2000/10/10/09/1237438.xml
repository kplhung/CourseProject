        <p>America is a young country with stories to tell. So rapid is our history that we like our stories simple, our characters unequivocal and our conflicts vivid, and this is why we turn so many of them into operas. This kind of narrative balladry has taken on an American style of its own: a lyrical storytelling in which music is an amiable, often meek appendage, happy to echo pastoral themes and bend to the dynamism of words and action.</p>
        <p>An old working model and a new prototype for American opera occupied the San Francisco Opera this weekend. Friday night it was ''The Ballad of Baby Doe,'' Douglas Moore's minor epic of boom, bust and romance in the Colorado silver industry 125 years ago. Last night brought a far more bitter and less romantic kind of art, a new opera taken from Sister Helen Prejean's book about a Louisiana execution, with music by Jake Heggie and a libretto from Terrence McNally. The book also inspired a devasting film by Tim Robbins starring Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon.</p>

        <p>America is a young country with stories to tell. So rapid is our history that we like our stories simple, our characters unequivocal and our conflicts vivid, and this is why we turn so many of them into operas. This kind of narrative balladry has taken on an American style of its own: a lyrical storytelling in which music is an amiable, often meek appendage, happy to echo pastoral themes and bend to the dynamism of words and action.</p>
        <p>An old working model and a new prototype for American opera occupied the San Francisco Opera this weekend. Friday night it was ''The Ballad of Baby Doe,'' Douglas Moore's minor epic of boom, bust and romance in the Colorado silver industry 125 years ago. Last night brought a far more bitter and less romantic kind of art, a new opera taken from Sister Helen Prejean's book about a Louisiana execution, with music by Jake Heggie and a libretto from Terrence McNally. The book also inspired a devasting film by Tim Robbins starring Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon.</p>
        <p>''Dead Man Walking'' is drama so loaded with moral questions, politics and the sheer horrors of suffering and death that the romance of American ballad opera quickly curdles. We are asked to weigh the violent deaths of murder victims against the institutional murder of the man responsible, also to reconcile Christian obligations to love with the near-justifiable instinct for revenge. More important, ''Dead Man Walking'' does not debate these issues; it shows them. We follow Joe de Rocher through the corridors and anterooms of Angola Prison as failed legal appeals and the machinery of execution take him gradually to his death.</p>
        <p>The San Francisco production by Joe Mantello and Michael Yeargan does this very well. Scene changes are liquid; the images are simple. Institutional gray and seediness set this stage as it should be set. Patrick Summers has prepared his orchestra and singers handsomely. Mr. McNally does his part. The economical libretto avoids verbiage and condenses scenes; indeed, ''Dead Man Walking'' does not keep us waiting.</p>
        <p>So with such strong forces at work in this new opera, it is sad to report that its music fails to show up. Mr. Heggie's career, or what I know of it, has taken a distinctive path to success. Whereas most composers appeal to the public for approval, he has gone to performers. Principally a writer of songs, Mr. Heggie is a proficient flatterer of the human voice, with a real knack for hitting its G spots. As a result, a series of important singers, charmed by the easy, unthreatening flow of his music, not to mention his considerable personal appeal, have carried the Heggie name to the public in their concerts. The San Francisco Opera, where Mr. Heggie worked in the public relations department, seems to have been the most charmed of all, having commissioned him to write ''Dead Man Walking'' and provided a first-rate production.</p>
        <p>Yet nice as Mr. Heggie's musical gifts may be, they are no match for the explosive issues and episodes entrusted to him. Singers are accommodated, schmoozed and made comfortable; and when high drama is required, Mr. Heggie gives us a drumroll, a few timpani whacks and a brass crescendo. The massed crowd choruses thrive on loudness and congestion. When these big ensembles do take on a certain power in the last scenes, credit more the raw, visceral drama surrounding the music, less the music itself. There is nothing musically offensive about ''Dead Man Walking,'' but to paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there's not much there there. The aesthetics of ingratiation take an artist only so far, and this is subject matter with far greater needs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heggie works hard to enliven his orchestra with conflicting inner motion and rhythm, but so ineffective is the instrumental sound that potentially interesting detail is lost in the general pallor. Mr. Heggie would have done well to turn his orchestration over to a professional.</p>
        <p>The singing principals are first-rate. Susan Graham sings touchingly as Sister Helen. John Packard is deeply and vividly affecting as the condemned man. Frederica von Stade works hard as his stricken mother. Also good are the quartet of bereaved parents: Nicolle Foland, Catherine Cook, Gary Rideout and especially Robert Orth in an extended part. Theresa Hamm-Smith, John Ames and Jay Hunter Morris do well. Sam Fleming's costumes capture the wash-and-wear culture of the Southern poor. So much of ''Dead Man Walking'' is worth our while, and so much of it is missing.</p>
