        <p>The Oakland Athletics' final rallies fizzled as quickly as they fell behind the Yankees tonight. Down to their final six outs and with a trip to the American League Championship Series at stake, the Athletics could not push a runner past second base.</p>
        <p>After racking up an 11-1 victory Saturday night in New York, the Athletics returned home confident, but they could not muster the clutch hitting and power that had carried them to the West Division title. In the end, the major leagues' youngest team could not overcome the Yankees' patience and tenacity.</p>
        <p>''We gave the defending champions all they wanted,'' said Randy Velarde, a former Yankee. ''We exploited some weaknesses in them. They know that. We showed you can get to their starting pitching. If they can't get six innings out of their starters and get to Mariano Rivera with a lead, they're vulnerable.''</p>
        <p>From the start of the A.L. playoffs, the low-budget Athletics tried to play loose against the Yankees, who carry baseball's highest payroll at $112 million. By contrast, these Athletics were assembled for a mere $32 million, ranking them among the bottom five teams.</p>
        <p>''You look at our club, and yes, it's a young group, but we've never used that as an excuse or a crutch,'' Athletics General Manager Billy Beane said before the series. ''It's a very young and talented team that just isn't very expensive yet.''</p>
        <p>Beane then paused, sensing that big futures are in store for the Athletics on the field and in salary negotiations.</p>
        <p>''Yet,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Still, the Athletics were the hottest team in the major leagues from Sept. 1 to the end of the season, going 24-9 and raising the belief that they could strike a blow for baseball's smaller markets by knocking off the defending, yet badly slumping, World Series champions.</p>
        <p>That idea survived impressively until tonight, but crashed and burned amid a huge first inning by the Yankees before 41,107 fans at Oakland Coliseum.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 6-0 before they came to bat against Andy Pettitte, the Athletics appeared to be another victim of the Yankees' postseason prowess. But they chipped away at that deficit until the score was 7-5 through four innings.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to come out a little more competitive than that,'' Eric Chavez said. ''That first inning was pretty much it. You can't expect a team to come back from that against a team like the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>The Athletics tried. Velarde worked the count full before delivering a two-run single in the second inning. In the third inning, Miguel Tejada scored from first base on Chavez's double into the left-center field gap to make the score 6-3.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 7-3 after a fourth-inning home run by David Justice, the Athletics responded again with two runs. After the bases were loaded with no outs, Jason Giambi and Almedo Saenz hit consecutive sacrifice flies to bring the Athletics within 7-5.</p>
        <p>By the second inning, Kevin Appier, the starter for Game 2, who had not pitched in relief since 1991, was on the mound for the Athletics. Appier had lost, 4-0, to the Yankees, so handing him the final game of the series seemed a curious move by Manager Art Howe. But with Tim Hudson and Barry Zito having pitched Friday and Saturday at Yankee Stadium, Howe had little choice after Gil Heredia was hammered by the Yankees so early in the game.</p>
        <p>Appier calmed the young Athletics and quieted the Yankee bats, too, working four innings, giving up four hits and one run -- Justice's line-drive homer that barely cleared the right-field wall -- while notching six strikeouts.</p>
        <p>Jim Mecir took over for Appier and held the Yankees in check for three innings, allowing one hit and striking out one. Still, the Athletics could not find any reserves in their powerful offense.</p>
        <p>''We didn't quit,'' Howe said of his young team. ''We battled the whole way and had our chances, but you have to look at what their bullpen did. After Pettitte went out, they just had too much for us.''</p>
