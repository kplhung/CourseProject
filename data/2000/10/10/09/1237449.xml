        <p>Punk rock isn't built to last. In pure hard-core form, it's a blast of compressed sound and fury, a momentary release of frustration with little concern for durability or detail. The doctrine is that anyone can play it. That's why Green Day, midway through a concert at Roseland on Wednesday night, called for volunteer musicians from the audience to climb onstage and bash through one of the cornerstones of punk, the Ramones' ''Blitzkrieg Bop.''</p>
        <p>But Green Day has straddled punk and pop for a decade, and pop has different goals. It sets out to lodge in a listener's memory with a catchy tune or a snappy chorus. Craftsmanship matters, even if it's concealed.  Billie Joe Armstrong, Green Day's guitarist and singer, didn't want pure amateurs tackling the Ramones song. He asked each guest ''Can you really play?'' and, after a quick tryout, ended up replacing the guitarist and bassist. The instant band wasn't bad, and its members jumped around so much as they played that Green Day, after retrieving its instruments, stepped up its own stage moves. The band didn't want to look too sedate.</p>

        <p>Punk rock isn't built to last. In pure hard-core form, it's a blast of compressed sound and fury, a momentary release of frustration with little concern for durability or detail. The doctrine is that anyone can play it. That's why Green Day, midway through a concert at Roseland on Wednesday night, called for volunteer musicians from the audience to climb onstage and bash through one of the cornerstones of punk, the Ramones' ''Blitzkrieg Bop.''</p>
        <p>But Green Day has straddled punk and pop for a decade, and pop has different goals. It sets out to lodge in a listener's memory with a catchy tune or a snappy chorus. Craftsmanship matters, even if it's concealed.  Billie Joe Armstrong, Green Day's guitarist and singer, didn't want pure amateurs tackling the Ramones song. He asked each guest ''Can you really play?'' and, after a quick tryout, ended up replacing the guitarist and bassist. The instant band wasn't bad, and its members jumped around so much as they played that Green Day, after retrieving its instruments, stepped up its own stage moves. The band didn't want to look too sedate.</p>
        <p>Green Day has reached an awkward point in its career, torn between settling down and acting up. Its multimillion-selling 1994 album, ''Dookie,'' was a summation of suburban late-adolescent complaints. It turned boredom, self-doubt, friction with parents and uncertain goals into loud, tuneful songs. Songs like ''Basket Case'' and ''When I Come Around'' are on the way to becoming perennial teenage anthems, and the young crowd at Roseland happily sang along.</p>
        <p>Yet Green Day has not tried to repeat the formula of its commercial peak. While the melodies on later albums have stayed strong, Mr. Armstrong's lyrics have outgrown bratty self-absorption, and the music has sometimes quieted down, with unpunk instruments like acoustic guitar. The band members are now in their late 20's, and they have some reflective moments like their 1997 hit, ''Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).'' The band's new album, ''Warning'' (Reprise) is closer to British Invasion pop from the 1960's than it is to punk from the 1970's.</p>
        <p>But onstage, Green Day still plays jubilant punk rock. Tre Cool's drumming sparks the blaring major chords from Mr. Armstrong and Mike Dirnt on bass; the music goes rocketing ahead. Green Day chose the up-tempo songs from ''Warning'' (Reprise), like ''Church on Sunday'' (a vow of faithfulness) and ''Minority'' (about defying authority). They also took requests, claiming to hear people asking for songs from their first independent releases like ''409 in Your Coffeemaker'' and ''Disappearing Boy.'' During the encores, Jason White joined Green Day to strum acoustic guitar on newer songs like the Kinks-style ''Warning,'' which sounded staid compared with the older material.</p>
        <p>Green Day wasn't going to make its exit looking too grown-up. After its last song came a full-scale punk-rock equipment demolition that left a heap of smashed drums and toppled amplifiers, while the drone of a battered bass insisted that Green Day can still be rowdy.</p>
