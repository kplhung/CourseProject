        <p>Correction of Sept 29 article about new paint technologies</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in the Automobiles section on Sept. 29 about new paint technologies misstated the number of special Ford Mustang Cobras painted with Flex Products' ChromaFlair, a color-shifting paint, and their hues. It was 2,000, not 1,200 cars, and the color changed from dark green to dark purple, not from deep blue to purple-black. The article also misstated the period in which Nissan used ChromaFlair on two cars in Europe. It was 1998 and 1999, not this year.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated Flex Products' investment in new pigment plants, and the number of new plants in Asia. It is more than $45 million, not $15 million, and the company is building one Asian plant, not two.</p>
        <p>The article referred incorrectly to the pigment used on numerals of the $20 bill. It is an ink used only in the printing of securities; it is not ChromaFlair.</p>
