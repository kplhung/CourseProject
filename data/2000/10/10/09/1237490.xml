        <p>It has been a local joke for as long as anyone can remember. Without fail, this village's stately granite monument overlooking the Hudson River manages to fool unsuspecting tourists with its grand claim that George Washington made his headquarters on this very spot during the Revolutionary War.</p>
        <p>And the punch line? Well, it seems that old George never slept here at all.</p>
        <p>''It's been a humorous secret that's not too secret,'' said Mayor Brian Monahan of Dobbs Ferry, who receives phone calls every so often from historians, reporters and tourists just now uncovering the falsehood. ''They're excited when they call, and then they're crushed when I tell them I already knew that. People have been talking about it for years.''</p>
        <p>The Sons of the American Revolution dedicated the 10-foot-tall, block-shaped monument on June 14, 1894, likely knowing full well that historical accounts placed Washington's headquarters three miles away in the town of Greenburgh. Though the motives of these forefathers may never be known for certain, historians have suggested that they were less interested in accuracy than in promoting tourism in Dobbs Ferry.</p>
        <p>''It was a big con job,'' said Bill Blanck, president of the Dobbs Ferry Historical Society.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Sons of the American Revolution finally made amends by ordering a $2,500 bronze plaque that will own up to the truth and cover over the monument's original engraving. Robert J. Stackpole, president of the New York chapter, admitted that it had become an embarrassment to a prestigious civic group whose members have included President Theodore Roosevelt, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and William Randolph Hearst.</p>
        <p>''We're the culprits,'' Mr. Stackpole said. ''We're the ones responsible for the monument, so it's our mea culpa.''</p>
        <p>But if they were the culprits, they had plenty of accomplices in this pretty riverfront town of 10,000, where small American flags flutter from telephone poles downtown. After all, village leaders donated the land for the monument and helped plan an anthem-singing dedication attended by Vice President Adlai E. Stevenson (grandfather of the later presidential candidate), United States Senator Chauncey M. DePew of New York (who was also president of the New York chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution) and a slew of dignitaries.</p>
        <p>''My great-grandfather was very active in the village back then,'' Mayor Monahan said. ''My guess is he was probably there.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, the monument even inspired an upscale, Colonial-style condominium complex -- called Washington's Headquarters -- behind the site. The complex has drawn some history lovers, like Mary Donovan, a history teacher who moved in three years ago and keeps an etching of Washington on her wall. She said she was not that disappointed to learn it wasn't Washington's headquarters after all.</p>
        <p>''I know enough about local boosterism to know that this kind of thing happened everywhere,'' Ms. Donovan said. ''That's why there are so many signs that say, 'George Washington slept here.' ''</p>
        <p>But many village residents have not found the monument so amusing. Years ago, students collected enough pennies to mount a bust of Washington atop the monument. The bust mysteriously disappeared a day later. And Mr. Blanck, the historian, said that Memorial Day parades and other patriotic celebrations had not stopped by the monument in the 50 years that he has lived here.</p>
        <p>''Nobody ever came here,'' Mr. Blanck said. ''We gritted our teeth. Of course it's embarrassing.''</p>
        <p>Although other historic sites have been influenced by civic pride and politics, the monument in Dobbs Ferry seems to have stretched the truth more than most. And that is putting it nicely. James M. Johnson, a military historian who teaches at Marist College, said he did not know of another instance in the Hudson River Valley in which an engraving was so misleading that it had to be changed.</p>
        <p>''You've heard the expression, 'Carved in stone?' '' he said. ''Well, that usually means it's forever.''</p>
        <p>After years of apologizing for the monument, Mr. Stackpole, a retired investment banker from White Plains, said he decided to do something now because historians are recreating the route taken by American and French troops for the 225th anniversary of the Revolutionary War next year. His group maintains about 20 monuments in the state.</p>
        <p>''This is the only one that we know has bootlegged history,'' Mr. Stackpole insisted. ''We can't be sending people here and explaining that it's all wrong.''</p>
        <p>At least not anymore, he means.</p>
        <p>Like many of the best fibs, this one had a glimmer of truth to it. In his letters, Washington did describe his headquarters ''near Dobbs Ferry,'' but he was referring to an actual ferry landing on the river and not a village that did not yet exist. And one historical account published in the 1840's placed Washington's headquarters here.</p>
        <p>By the time the monument was dedicated, however, historians had concluded that Washington actually camped down the road and was joined there by his counterpart in the French Army, the Comte de Rochambeau. A scathing attack on the monument came barely a year later, on March 23, 1895, in an editorial in The Tarrytown Argus. ''It is curious if not astonishing that in view of the unquestioned facts so disclosed that the Sons of the American Revolution should have been a party to such a stupid monumental blunder,'' the column stated.</p>
        <p>The monument's 105-word engraving also claims that this was the spot where Washington planned the victorious Yorktown campaign that ended the Revolutionary War, and where he later returned to arrange for the evacuation of British troops from American soil. Actually, Mr. Stackpole said, Washington did not know yet that he was headed for Yorktown. And the British evacuation was discussed across the Hudson River in Sneden's Landing.</p>
        <p>Teri Watson, a sales clerk in White Plains, said she was let in on the joke only last year by a village resident after she took two friends from Virginia to visit the monument.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I flunked a history test,'' Ms. Watson said with a laugh. ''We were standing there reading everything and taking pictures. Nobody told us. I guess I should call my friends and tell them it wasn't real.''</p>
        <p>Real or not, the monument seems destined to stay. Mr. Stackpole said that moving it would be too costly, and chiseling off the original engraving could crack the granite, so his group will just add the bronze plaque on top. It will claim modestly, and truthfully, that Washington built two artillery batteries and a redoubt in Dobbs Ferry and stationed soldiers along the Hudson River to guard against a British naval attack.</p>
        <p>Mr Stackpole also plans to mark Washington's headquarters in Greenburgh though no one has yet demanded that satisfaction. ''It was the same region,'' said Paul Feiner, the Greenburgh supervisor. ''I personally didn't think it was so horrible.''</p>
        <p>On a recent chilly morning, Mr. Stackpole pointed out the inaccuracies on the Dobbs Ferry monument one by one as Mr. Blanck frowned with disapproval. They met three years ago after Mr. Stackpole called and offered to fix the monument. ''Great, it's about time,'' Mr. Blanck told him. Since then, the two men have worked closely with other historians to make sure the new plaque does not tell any tall tales.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't like to repeat it again, no,'' Mr. Blanck said. ''I've lived with it for 50 years, and I'm very happy to see this change. When you write something in stone, it better be right ----''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Stackpole interrupted him with a knowing look. ''Or maybe that's why they did it,'' he said. ''Because they knew it would be a monumental effort to change it.''</p>
