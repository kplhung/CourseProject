        <p>When Cory A. Booker talks about fixing America's school system, he invokes the words of Malcolm X: by any means necessary.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Booker, 31, an African-American Democrat elected to the Newark City Council in 1998, that means lobbying state lawmakers for smaller classes and teacher testing. It means organizing book drives for the schools in his impoverished neighborhood, and arranging for an insurance company to create a community health clinic at one of them.</p>
        <p>And it also means the unbridled backing of the contentious notion of giving parents vouchers financed by taxpayers to send their children to private schools.</p>
        <p>''It's one of the last remaining major barriers to equality of opportunity in America, the fact that we have inequality of education,'' Mr. Booker explained. ''I don't necessarily want to depend on the government to educate my children -- they haven't done a good job in doing that. Only if we return power to the parents can we find a way to fix the system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Booker, a Rhodes scholar who quotes Frederick Douglass and Langston Hughes in his speeches, is part of a growing cadre of young blacks who have embraced vouchers, and school choice more broadly, as a central civil rights issue for their generation.</p>
        <p>While established African-American organizations have been among the leaders of the opposition to school vouchers, arguing that they would decimate the public school system, maverick black politicians and community organizers are increasingly the public face of the pro-voucher movement financed largely by white Republican businessmen.</p>
        <p>Polls show strong support for vouchers among African-Americans. A new national organization, the Black Alliance for Educational Options, started a pro-voucher campaign this fall. And in California and Michigan, where voters will consider voucher initiatives in November, prominent African-Americans have popped up on both sides of the ballot.</p>
        <p>''The old civil rights movement got us to the lunch counter,'' said Mikel Holt, the author of a new book, ''Not Yet 'Free at Last' '' (Institute for Contemporary Studies), which defines ''the unfinished business of the civil rights movement'' as the struggle for school choice. ''The new civil rights agenda,'' he said, ''is, can we afford to buy the lunch? And, more importantly, can our kids read the menu?''</p>
        <p>Omar Wasow, 29, the executive director of blackplanet.com, a Web site for African-Americans, said he sees school choice as a direct outgrowth of Brown v. the Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court decision that desegregated public schools.</p>
        <p>The goal then, as now, was to give poor black children access to the same quality education as their better-off white counterparts, Mr. Wasow said; only the methods have changed. Where his civil rights forebears focused on ending legal discrimination and turned to the government for protection, Mr. Wasow sees the enemy in subtler racism and believes the savior resides in the private sector. Vouchers are his voter registration.</p>
        <p>''The black freedom struggle has fundamentally been about trying to produce a society where black individuals have as much freedom and agency as white Americans,'' said Mr. Wasow, whose parents met in a 1960's program to mentor inner-city youth. ''As long as black people are trapped in failing public schools, we will never achieve the kind of dignity and power that has been the central cause of the black freedom struggle for more than 200 years.''</p>
        <p>Vouchers, first proffered by the economist Milton Friedman in a 1955 essay, are among the most divisive issues in education, a critical point of dissension between this year's two major presidential candidates. Vice President Al Gore, who has been endorsed by the teachers unions, shares their adamant opposition to vouchers of any kind. Gov. George W. Bush has proposed allowing parents of children in failing schools to take $1,500 in federal money and use it for any education purpose, including private-school tuition, but has avoided the word voucher.</p>
        <p>Only about 12,000 of the nation's 52 million schoolchildren -- in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Pensacola, Fla. -- use public money to attend private schools, but the idea is growing in popularity and is on the legislative agenda in many states.</p>
        <p>Advocates contend that only market pressure will force the radical changes they believe are necessary to improve student achievement, particularly in poor urban communities, and that parents deserve the right to choose a school for their children. Opponents contend that, when used in religious schools, vouchers muddy the line between church and state, and that any loss of financing would further weaken the struggling public schools left behind. Evidence has been mixed as to whether vouchers have any effect on children's learning.</p>
        <p>Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, called education the civil rights crucible for the 21st century but said that vouchers were the wrong tool.</p>
        <p>Voucher proponents offer false promise to poor parents because there are too few private-school slots to accommodate them, Mr. Henderson said, and most voucher proposals fall short of covering the entire cost of top academies, leaving truly disadvantaged families without a full range of choices. Mr. Henderson also questioned the integrity of pro-voucher politicians who claim concern over failing schools but have long fought efforts to improve school buildings, reduce class sizes and raise teacher salaries. And he worried that blacks were being exploited by free-market ideologues whose interest in inner-city children was mostly strategic.</p>
        <p>''Many of the interests that are suggesting privatization of public resources and vouchers are the very forces that have helped to thwart the kind of meaningful education that Brown promised,'' Mr. Henderson said, referring to the landmark court decision. ''Quality education can best be provided with high-quality public institutions. We're committed to their establishment, restoration, revitalization.''</p>
        <p>Terence Baine, the education chairman for the Newark chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, accompanied Mr. Booker and about 30 other legislators and community leaders on a recent fact-finding mission to Milwaukee, home of the nation's oldest and largest voucher program. But after hours of pro-voucher cheerleading, Mr. Baine remained unconvinced: would private schools accept disabled students and others who are hard to teach? Why not focus on bringing innovation and accountability to public schools?</p>
        <p>''I just believe you can't have a financial incentive in public education -- it's scary,'' said Mr. Baine, 37. ''It's really like a way of government walking away, giving up. Disgusting.''</p>
        <p>African-Americans on the other side insist that they, too, want to improve public schools -- but say they cannot wait.</p>
        <p>Howard Fuller, who served as Milwaukee's school superintendent after helping create the city's voucher program in 1990, says his goal is simply to level the playing field. White, middle-class families escape failing schools by moving to better neighborhoods or opting for private schools, he noted, while poor, minority families are stuck.</p>
        <p>''People with money in America today have choices,'' Mr. Fuller, a veteran of the Black Power movement, told the New Jersey group at a Catholic high school in Milwaukee last month.</p>
        <p>''Our argument back then was power to the people,'' he added. ''You tell me how you empower people in America if you don't ever give them control over the money.''</p>
        <p>Because of their focus on equality of opportunity -- as opposed to free-market philosophy -- Mr. Fuller, Mr. Booker and many other African-Americans oppose universal voucher programs, like the one on the ballot in California, which would give all the state's students $4,000 vouchers to attend their school of choice. They prefer programs like Milwaukee's, which targets low-income families, or the proposal in Michigan, which focuses on schools with dismal dropout rates.</p>
        <p>Powered in recent years by philanthropic financiers, the voucher movement has a growing grass-roots component of low-income parents in large cities.</p>
        <p>A 1999 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found that 60 percent of African-Americans favored vouchers -- compared with 53 percent of the overall population -- and support swells to 72 percent among blacks earning less than $15,000 a year.</p>
        <p>To help change the face of the movement, Mr. Fuller formed the Black Alliance for Educational Options. Board members include a Colorado businessman who was ousted as president of his local N.A.A.C.P. chapter for writing a pro-voucher article; a minister who is co-chairman of the Michigan initiative; Ohio's Secretary of State, J. Kenneth Blackwell; and Dwight Evans, a Democratic state legislator from Philadelphia. There are also several young professionals involved in charter schools and online education ventures.</p>
        <p>''My generation must harness the power to guide our children out of mental slavery, by any means necessary,'' Amber Blackwell, a 29-year-old mother of two who is on the Black Alliance board and plans to open a new school in Oakland, said in an e-mail interview. ''Our liberation looks different in 2000 than it did in the late 60's and 70's. We are fighting for the last chains to be taken from our minds.''</p>
        <p>To that end, Mr. Booker's schedule in recent weeks has been filled with voucher events. He was featured at a lunch for the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, where his table at the Harvard Club was filled with businessmen; he debated an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Grand Rapids, Mich., who marveled that Mr. Booker gets good ratings from her organization on all other issues; and he led the New Jersey mission to Milwaukee, where he tossed a football with children at a public elementary school and visited a Catholic school and a school dedicated to high technology, both of which have benefited from vouchers.</p>
        <p>At the Harvard Club, in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Booker told a story of tutoring in East Palo Alto while an undergraduate at Stanford University, and asking the children to stretch their hands as high as they could -- then stretch three inches more. When Mr. Booker offered $5 to the child who could reach the highest, a small boy, Robert, ran from the room. He was headed for the roof.</p>
        <p>''The impossible is the least we can demand,'' Mr. Booker said, quoting James Baldwin. ''Not just a three-inch change. We can find a way to get to the roof.''</p>
