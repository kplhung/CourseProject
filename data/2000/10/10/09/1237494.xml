        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio condemned the United States yesterday for abstaining on a United Nations resolution censuring Israel for the violence in the Middle East. It was a rare moment of agreement in a debate during which Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio argued over whether New York would be helped or hurt by having a Republican in the Senate next year.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's disavowal of the abstention marked one of her strongest breaks with any policy embraced by President Clinton during her 15-month campaign for the Senate, and it came about 10 hours after Mr. Lazio issued a statement condemning the United States for failing to veto the United Nations Security Council resolution Saturday evening.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said of Mrs. Clinton's statement on the United Nations resolution: ''She is a candidate for office and will take her own positions on what should be done.''</p>
        <p>The positions taken by Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton underlined the importance of Jewish voters in this contest for Senate, and suggested the extent to which the turmoil in the Middle East could form a part of the backdrop in the closing weeks of this contest for Senate.</p>
        <p>The exchanges came in a 60-minute debate during which the first lady and Representative Lazio sketched out different views on issues varying from public financing of political campaigns, to restrictions on abortions, to the tax on gasoline, to whom they would like to see on the Supreme Court, to whether public money should be used to build a new stadium on Manhattan's West Side. (Mrs. Clinton said no, and Mr. Lazio said yes.)</p>
        <p>Their encounter, broadcast statewide from the WCBS-TV studio in Manhattan, was markedly different in tone from their meeting in Buffalo last month. The two candidates were firm but resolutely polite yesterday, and each was more relaxed in the second of what is likely to be three debates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who was criticized by Republicans for being belligerent and overly aggressive in their first debate, particularly when he strode over to Mrs. Clinton's lectern, said on CNN after yesterday's encounter that he ''chained myself to the podium'' this time, a turn of phrase that accurately captured his overall demeanor. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton persistently questioned Mr. Lazio's political views and credentials, at times seeming to be trying to goad him into reprising the debate performance that even aides to Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, now say hurt his standing, particularly among women.</p>
        <p>From a television perspective -- which is, from the candidates' point of view, the most important perspective from which to judge how a debate is being perceived -- perhaps the most notable moment came as the two candidates argued over each other's campaign financing practices. Mrs. Clinton asserted that Mr. Lazio had broken a pact between them on controlling spending by accepting $1.8 million worth of television advertisements by the Republican National Committee. She tried to turn an argument he had used against her back on him, asserting that Mr. Lazio's actions showed him to be untrustworthy.</p>
        <p>''Last month, Mr. Lazio said that this was an issue of trust and character,'' Mrs. Clinton said evenly. ''He was right. And if New Yorkers can't trust him to keep his word for 10 days, how can they trust him for six years on issues like Social Security, Medicare, prescription drugs and education?''</p>
        <p>A few moments later, Mr. Lazio responded to her statement by evoking the questions that have shadowed her fund-raising practices: ''Mrs. Clinton, please, no lectures from Motel 1600 on campaign finance reform.'' The camera showed Mrs. Clinton staring grimly at Mr. Lazio's reference to campaign contributors' being invited to spend the night at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
        <p>The debate began at 10:30 a.m., rather than at night, which is when debates are more customarily held.  It also ended seven hours before the start of Yom Kippur, the most solemn day on the Jewish calendar. Aides to both candidates said they thought it would be less noticed, and thus have less impact, than the last debate in Buffalo, and neither side seemed particularly unhappy about that.</p>
        <p>Repeatedly during the debate, Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton returned to what both campaigns have said would be one of their closing themes over the next month; whether New York would be helped or hurt by sending a Republican to the Senate to join Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio argued that New York needed a Republican in the Senate to ensure that it had a voice in the majority, assuming Republicans maintain control after November. ''I have been in the minority and the majority, and let me tell you, I know that in the majority -- it's the people in the majority who craft the bills, who write the language, who are in the position to actually get the job done,'' he said. He pointed to Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, both of whom were sitting in the audience, as evidence that Republicans are good for New York.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton, responding to questions from a panel of four reporters and the moderator, Marcia Kramer of WCBS-TV, sought to turn that argument against Mr. Lazio.  ''The Senate is dominated by people who don't necessarily agree with how we need to do things here in New York,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I could defend Jesse Helms and Trent Lott and the people that Mr. Lazio will have to vote for,'' she said at another point. ''His first vote will be for continuing Trent Lott's majority leadership, unless what I think will happen and that is the Democrats take over.''</p>
        <p>On Israel, both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton were in agreement in deploring the United States' abstention at the United Nations on Saturday evening, producing the unlikely image of Mrs. Clinton assailing her husband's foreign policy, though she never mentioned him by name.</p>
        <p>''I believe that it was a wrong move not to have vetoed it, that it was inaccurate and one-sided,'' Mrs. Clinton said in response to a question by Gregg Birnbaum of The New York Post. ''It did not address the violence that I believe is fomented by Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority. It did not address what Israel has tried to do, such as showing good faith by pulling out of Lebanon and the fact that there's violence on that border.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton had also issued a statement Saturday night after the United Nations resolution, denouncing the Security Council's response to the violence in the Mideast as shameful and its condemnation of Israel as one-sided.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio noted that he had put out a statement immediately after the vote expressing ''my strong disappointment'' with the United States for not vetoing it.</p>
        <p>''For several generations, and for several administrations from both parties, we have had unequivocal support for the state of Israel,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''This sends all the wrong messages about whether or not we stand firmly behind our democratic ally in the Middle East. They need to know that we stand behind them, stand by their side.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also said that he would not ''support a call for a Palestinian state,'' drawing a clear if unstated comparison with the position of Mrs. Clinton. And both candidates disputed the suggestion by Arab leaders that blame for the violence lay with Ariel Sharon, the Likud opposition leader, who had led a visit to a contested holy site in Jerusalem that helped provoke Palestinian anger.</p>
        <p>''I think that every Palestinian, every Israeli, every Jew from the world is really entitled to have access to Temple Mount,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>But they spent most of the time drawing distinctions on domestic issues. Mrs. Clinton said she supported public financing for political campaigns. Mr. Lazio said he would oppose that. ''I don't think that we should have welfare for politicians,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio presented himself as a supporter of abortion rights, criticized Mrs. Clinton for supporting a form of abortion that opponents call partial-birth abortion, and faulted her for being endorsed by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. ''My opponent opposes a ban on partial-birth abortions,'' he said. ''She is supported by Naral, that is so extreme on this issue that it wants to kick the Vatican out of the U.N.''</p>
        <p>Naral does want the Vatican's role weakened at the U.N. And Mrs. Clinton disputed his characterization of her views. ''My opponent is just wrong,'' she said. ''I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lazio was asked who among the current Supreme Court justices best reflected the kind of nominee he would vote for on the court, he named Sandra Day O'Connor. ''No litmus tests,'' he said, laying out his criteria. ''Let's make sure we get somebody who has a healthy respect for precedent, who's got the ability to make good decisions, and who's got, hopefully, a good experience of being on the bench.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton did not name a sitting justice, but argued that the future of the Supreme Court ''hangs in the balance in this election.''</p>
        <p>''If we take Governor Bush at his word,'' she said, ''his two favorite justices are Scalia and Thomas, both of whom are committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, ending a woman's right to choose. I could not go along with that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio reiterated his opposition to the tax on gasoline, which Mrs. Clinton supports.</p>
        <p>At another point, Mr. Lazio criticized the health care proposal Mrs. Clinton had advocated in 1992 and 1994. ''Let me just say that Mrs. Clinton's plan in 1993 would have been an unmitigated disaster for New York,'' he said. ''No New Yorker would ever have written a bill that would have led to 75,000 jobs' being destroyed, health care rationing and the destruction of many of our teaching hospitals, which are an incredible asset for New York.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton referred to that time as a ''learning experience,'' but said she was committed to achieving ''quality, affordable health insurance for every American,'' if at a slower pace.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the moment that best captured how the tone of this debate differed from the last one came when Ms. Kramer asked Mrs. Clinton, whose daughter, Chelsea, was sitting in the audience, why she had not left President Clinton after their marital difficulties.</p>
        <p>''The choices that I've made in my life are right for me,'' Mrs. Clinton responded. ''I can't talk about anybody else's choice. I can only say that mine are rooted in my religious faith, in my strong sense of family, and in what I believe is right and important.''</p>
        <p>In Buffalo, when Tim Russert had asked Mrs. Clinton a question about her defense of President Clinton when he was accused of having an affair, Mr. Lazio had followed up by attacking the first lady for her answer. This time, when the camera turned to him, Mr. Lazio had a different response. ''Well, I think this was Mrs. Clinton's choice and I respect whatever choice that she makes,'' he said.</p>
