        <p>The Rangers may be fortunate that the National Hockey League is having its referees call things by the book this season.</p>
        <p>It looks as if the Rangers can score on the power play and take advantage of the league's strict enforcement of the rules. That may help the Rangers get off to an uncharacteristically strong start.</p>
        <p>''At the start of the season, it looks like they are going to really clamp down and call some stick infractions,'' said Mark Messier, who assisted on the first of the Rangers' two power-play goals in their season-opening 2-1 victory at Atlanta on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>''That's O.K., but there were a couple of questionable calls on some hits,'' he said, still angry about a cross-checking penalty he received in the second period.</p>
        <p>''But if it's the same for everybody, everybody is going to have to adjust to it. And I think the players will, just as long as they don't take the hitting out of the game.''</p>
        <p>The league wants to open up the ice again for its skilled players, who were slowed down during the 1990's by the holding and slashing tactics of less-skilled teams.</p>
        <p>As usual, the Rangers are loaded with skill players, though that does not always translate into power-play success.</p>
        <p>A season ago, it took the Rangers four games to score their second power-play goal. It also took them four games to win their first contest.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta, the Rangers looked completely different with the man advantage.</p>
        <p>It took them only one period to score two power-play goals, which proved to be enough offense to beat the second-year Thrashers.</p>
        <p>It was the first time since the 1992-93 season that the Rangers opened with a victory.</p>
        <p>And it came in Messier's long-awaited regular-season return.</p>
        <p>There were numerous reasons why the Rangers sought to bring back the 39-year-old Messier, who left for Vancouver in the summer of 1997.</p>
        <p>A less notable one was Messier's value on the power play.</p>
        <p>He may not score as many goals as he used to, but Messier can still skate and pass with the best of them.</p>
        <p>That was evident on the Rangers' first goal, 18 minutes 40 seconds into the game.</p>
        <p>With the Rangers skating five on three, Messier made a feather pass from the top of the slot to the bottom of the left-wing circle, where Valery Kamensky boomed a one-timer behind Atlanta goaltender Damian Rhodes for a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Less than a minute later, with the Rangers skating five on four, Petr Nedved tapped in the rebound of Kim Johnsson's slap shot.</p>
        <p>Just like that, the Rangers had two power-play goals.</p>
        <p>Last season the Rangers waited until their 29th game to score two power-play goals in a contest.</p>
        <p>Before that, the Rangers were 9 for 112 on the power play to open the 1999-2000 season.</p>
        <p>By that time, they had buried themselves deep in a hole, one from which they never were able to escape.</p>
        <p>Even though the Rangers finished the season with a power play that was ranked 10th in the league, all those lost points early in the season helped ensure they would miss the Stanley Cup playoffs for the third straight spring.</p>
        <p>To avoid making it four straight springs without a playoff berth, the Rangers' power play must improve from last season, when it suffered without Wayne Gretzky.</p>
        <p>This season, it can only benefit from the presence of Messier and Vladimir Malakhov, too.</p>
        <p>Malakhov was the one who kept the puck in the offensive zone at the blue line on the Rangers' first goal.</p>
        <p>That is why the Rangers hope that the knee sprain that Malakhov sustained midway through Saturday's second period is not serious.</p>
        <p>''The power play did what it was supposed to,'' Rangers Coach Ron Low said after the game. ''The power play is going to have to score goals.''</p>
        <p>That is, if the Rangers do not want a repeat of last season.</p>
