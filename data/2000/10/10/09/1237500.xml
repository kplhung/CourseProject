        <p>The Yugoslav President, Vojislav Kostunica, struggled today, his first in office, to consolidate his authority over Serbia and his own allies, trying to find a balance between revolutionary justice and legality in the post-Milosevic era.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica is president, but some in the 18-party coalition that backed him are afraid that his concern for legal niceties may prove costly in the uneasy vacuum of power that has followed Slobodan Milosevic's ouster.</p>
        <p>Already, there have been serious behind-the-scenes struggles for control of the police, the courts, the banking system and customs authorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's coalition has formed a ''crisis committee'' that is a kind of parallel government to the Serbian authorities who were beholden to Mr. Milosevic. They are moving through institutions one by one, trying to ensure support for a new democratic authority.</p>
        <p>''We are against revolutionary transformation, but there are always people for revolutionary change,'' said Dragor Hiber, a member of the crisis committee.</p>
        <p>Veran Matic, the president of ANEM, the Association of Independent Electronic Media, said the greatest danger to Mr. Kostunica ''is the question of the unity of the democratic opposition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's problems range from the enormous to the bizarre. One of the most bizarre concerns the visit on Tuesday of the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine. Mr. Vedrine, along with President Clinton -- who called Mr. Kostunica today -- and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, were convicted in absentia of war crimes in a pre-election propaganda exercise here. Formally, Mr. Vedrine and the others face arrest and 20 years in jail, and their photographs are up on wanted posters in police stations and at the airport.</p>
        <p>Kostunica officials are afraid that the police may embarrass Mr. Vedrine at the airport. Mr. Kostunica can sign an amnesty, but that is considered politically awkward here. The public prosecutor can void the conviction, but the process is clumsy. So the officials are working, quietly, on the police not to act.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton spoke to Mr. Kostunica this evening for five minutes to congratulate him. Mr. Kostunica has been reluctant to have William Montgomery, the ambassador who has been running the ''Yugoslav embassy in exile'' in Budapest, to be appointed the American ambassador in Belgrade when relations are restored. Mr. Montgomery's office in Budapest helped to run and fund the anti-Milosevic campaign, which Mr. Kostunica regarded as overt meddling in Serbia's affairs.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kostunica would go along with the appointment, his aides say, if all sanctions against Yugoslavia are lifted, including the so-called outer wall, which blocks Yugoslav access to international financial institutions -- and thus to crucial loans and credits.</p>
        <p>Control of the police is a significant issue. The police did not in any serious way oppose the mass protest last Thursday that led to the burning of the federal Parliament, helped along by some prior agreements made with the opposition.</p>
        <p>In today's issue of the daily Politika, Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, the backbone of the opposition, said the police ''had reorganized, stabilized and realized what the interest of the people is, and the police have become practically immune to orders that could bring them into conflict with the people.''</p>
        <p>But knowledgeable officials say  former police and security officials with connections to Mr. Djindjic attempted to take provisional control of Belgrade police headquarters on Friday morning and again this morning, telling the chief of police, Gen. Branko Djuric, to hand over his authority and his firearm. General Djuric called other opposition officials, with whom he had promised cooperation, and said he would shoot himself first. He asked for protection and someone to guard him at night. The situation has continued, but with the intervention this morning of Mr. Kostunica himself, it appears to have been calmed, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic's head of state security, Rade Markovic, is also said to have contacted Mr. Kostunica's aides complaining about death threats from former security officers, and has discussed resigning. Mr. Kostunica met privately today with top security officials.</p>
        <p>On Friday, at the lucrative Customs Department, a close Milosevic ally, Mihalj Kertes, was pressured by armed men working for the opposition to leave office. Weapons were reportedly found in Mr. Kertes' office. To the surprise of Mr. Kostunica and some of his allies, a businessman named Dusan Zabunovic, who is considered close to Mr. Djindjic and owns an import company called M.P.S., was appointed head of customs. The selection caused such an uproar among the opposition leaders themselves that it was rescinded the same day.</p>
        <p>There was another drama at the courts, with senior Milosevic judges like Milena Arezina, chief judge of the Serbian trade court, ordering the destruction of documents relating to sensitive cases, like the government takeover of the I.C.N. pharmaceutical company owned by Milan Panic, a Serb-American, and the cases against ABC Produkt, a publisher that owns an independent daily newspaper, Glas Javnosti.</p>
        <p>People working in the judiciary called opposition officials to warn them of the destruction of the files, some of which was stopped. There was a similar incident at the Foreign Ministry, though of lesser importance.</p>
        <p>Indicative of the problems was the drama on Saturday at the main state bank that clears payments between businesses, an organization known as the Zavod za Obracun Placanja, or Zop. The crisis committee was told that Milosevic officials were transferring large sums of money to private companies to pay for pre-election government purchases of cooking oil and sugar.</p>
        <p>The company that created the bank's electronic data system agreed to crash the computers to stop the transactions, but allow for the payment of important benefits like pensions. The crisis committee then appointed Zivko Nesic, general manager of the bank until fired in 1998, to manage it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica and his allies are also trying to assert control over the Serbian government and Parliament, which did not go through new elections. It has been dominated by Mr. Milosevic's coalition, which was allied with the Serbian Radical Party. If, however, the Radicals realign themselves with the Serbian Renewal Movement, another party that was sometimes in opposition and sometimes allied with Mr. Milosevic, they could bring down the current government. Both those parties fear that new elections, which Mr. Kostunica wants in both the federal and Serbian parliaments within the next 90 days, will devastate them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica is trying to convince the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, a wavering Milosevic ally who was also indicted by the war crimes tribunal, to dissolve the Serbian Parliament on the grounds that new elections are required to restore political stability. Mr. Milutinovic, not known for bravery, is being told that now is the time to move or face charges.</p>
        <p>If he does not help, and the two other parties do not play along, Mr. Kostunica and his allies are prepared to call for tens of thousands of citizens to rally in front of the Parliament, a form of threat.</p>
