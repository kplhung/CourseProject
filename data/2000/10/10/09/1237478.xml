        <p>The Jets gave Kordell Stewart an opportunity to heat up what will surely be a quarterback controversy this week in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Kent Graham has had a bruised hip for the past two games, and now the Steelers are 2-0 under Stewart, whom Graham supplanted when he arrived last spring as a free agent from the Giants. Graham is 0-3 as a starter, but Coach Bill Cowher, who waited until game time to announce his starter, has insisted that Graham will be his starter as soon as he is healthy again.</p>
        <p>Stewart undoubtedly made that decision more difficult today. He completed 17 of 26 passes for 140 yards and a touchdown and rushed 6 times for 33 yards.</p>
        <p>But Stewart, who has a good relationship with Graham, played down any controversy.</p>
        <p>''It's only because of the injury that I'm starting,'' Stewart said. ''It's basically still his job and when he's healthy, he'll be back starting. I just happened to be ready and have played well. It hasn't been easy. The Lord has really relaxed my mind and my heart. I'm really at ease and tell myself, 'Don't press, don't stress.' I have no reason to press or worry other than what I have to do. This shouldn't be about Kordell Stewart and Kent Graham, it should be about the Steelers.''</p>
        <p>Cowher has said that Graham and the offense had shown improvement with each game before Graham got hurt. But the offense has had its two best games with Stewart. He threw the Steelers' first touchdown pass of the season in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''I thought our offense played very well and I thought Kordell did a very good job,'' Cowher said. ''It may have been the best we've played all year.''</p>
        <p>End of the Line</p>
        <p>A number of streaks ended today: Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis, who ran for 107 yards on 25 carries, became the first player to rush for 100 yards against the Jets this season. . . . Curtis Martin, who fumbled the ball in the third quarter, had handled the ball 544 times on rushes and receptions without losing the ball, dating to the American Football Conference championship game in 1998. . . . The Jets' eight-game winning streak, dating to last season, ended. It was the second longest in Jets history. They won nine in a row in 1986. The last time the Jets lost was to the Giants on Dec. 5, 1999. They had won six straight at home. . . . Pittsburgh is 13-1 against the Jets. The Jets' only victory over the Steelers came in 1988.</p>
