        <p>Over the next few weeks, property assessors carrying digital cameras will fan out across Nassau County to begin the gargantuan task of updating the assessed values of about 416,000 parcels of real estate. It will be the county's first full revaluation in 62 years.</p>
        <p>Revaluations are an essential responsibility of local government, and Nassau's reluctance over six decades has left its property tax system so off kilter that nearly everyone pays too much or too little. The county now spends about $100 million a year on refunds to taxpayers who challenge their bills.</p>
        <p>While Nassau has delayed unusually long, and its foot-dragging is all the more visible because of its larger fiscal crisis, the county is not alone in failing to maintain fair taxes. In many communities across the New York region, the expectation of paying one's fair share, inherent in any tax system tied to property values, no longer exists.</p>
        <p>In Westchester County, where real estate prices have shifted widely as the suburban population has boomed in recent decades, many towns have not revalued property in more than 40 years. Efforts in the last five years by the State Legislature to force a countywide revaluation have all failed.</p>
        <p>In Newark, the last revaluation was in 1961. After a 28-year court fight, the State of New Jersey recently won permission to order a revaluation against the city's wishes.</p>
        <p>And in Rockland County, N.Y., a threat of litigation over disparities in school taxes led officials in the county's five towns to agree to an exceedingly rare joint revaluation, which began last year.</p>
        <p>Many experts say that to guarantee fairness, revaluations should be done every year. But of the three states in the New York region, only Connecticut explicitly mandates revaluations, requiring them every four years.</p>
        <p>Local governments have had many reasons for putting off revaluation. The process has always been expensive and labor-intensive, requiring a small army of assessors to visit and inspect each property. And for most of the last century, major social changes -- like urban decay and the shift from an industrial to a service-based economy -- provided the argument that revaluation would hit homeowners too hard.</p>
        <p>New technology -- including constantly updated databases of property sales, computerized maps and digital photographs -- has made revaluations much easier. And the relative economic and social stability of the last decade has meant that once the tax rolls are updated, there is far less chance of unpredictable changes in tax bills.</p>
        <p>Still, there is rarely a rush to revalue. Taxpayers and politicians generally see nothing but peril in tinkering with property taxes. Taxpayers fear that no matter what happens, they will end up paying more, and elected officials worry that they will be blamed for any increases that occur.</p>
        <p>Over time, almost inevitably, inequities  develop as land values change and wealthier property owners pay less than their fair share while poorer owners pay more than theirs. Owners of homes worth similar amounts often have tax bills that differ by thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>In Nassau County, the disparity has also played out on racial and ethnic lines. In the predominantly white hamlet of Manhasset, assessments on average are 27 percent too low, according to a statistical analysis conducted last year by Newsday. In Roosevelt, which has a large black and Hispanic population, property was judged to be overassessed by about 16 percent. A lawsuit brought by minority residents forced Nassau  into the revaluation that is about to begin.</p>
        <p>Another hindrance in Nassau and elsewhere has been the hodgepodge of local and state laws and court rulings -- often antiquated and at times conflicting -- that regulate property taxes. Even these laws are often upended by the haphazard granting of exemptions and other discounts.</p>
        <p>But the largest obstacle to property tax reform, experts say, is the fear among elected officials that they will be held responsible by voters whose tax bills increase. And those whose bills increase tend to be affluent or middle class, and thus more vocal and politically active.</p>
        <p>Dick Netzer, a public policy professor at New York University, said politicians find safety in the status quo. ''It's been like this for a long time -- nobody has been voted out of office because of it,'' he said in explaining their thinking. '' 'If we change it, somebody is going to be hurt and maybe I will be voted out of office. So let's leave it.' ''</p>
        <p>In some places, the worries are reasonable. In tax districts that have seen an erosion of industrial and commercial property, like Newark, revaluation will shift the tax burden heavily onto middle-class homeowners. Homeowners say that amounts to a punishment for building a stable neighborhood.</p>
        <p>New Jersey law requires property assessments based on full market value, which would seem to require annual revaluations. But that simply does not happen in many places, and the state's ability to enforce the law is limited. New York, which is widely regarded to have some of the most convoluted property tax systems in the country, has laws that are similarly difficult to enforce.</p>
        <p>But Professor Netzer and other experts say the fearful thinking underscores just how little most people, even most elected officials, know about how property taxes work and what revaluations accomplish. Assessors say the resistance to revaluation proves another point: forget fairness -- every taxpayer wants to pay less than the next.</p>
        <p>What makes revaluation complicated for many people is that it is not a straight raising or lowering of everyone's tax bill. The goal of a revaluation is not to change the total amount of taxes collected by the local government but to rebalance or equalize the tax burden in light of market changes.</p>
        <p>Whether taxes go up or down depends on the budget drawn up by a local executive and legislature. Local finance officials determine how much revenue is needed from the property tax, and accordingly the tax rate -- a fixed amount per $1,000 of assessed value -- is raised or lowered in the annual budget.</p>
        <p>What a revaluation changes is how much each property owner pays in relation to others. If every house in a town doubles in value, everybody's taxes stay the same. But if some values rise while others drop, those with increasing values will pay more tax, while those with reduced values will pay less.</p>
        <p>Professional assessors say that in theory, everybody wins in a revaluation because the property tax system is made fair, contributing to the overall fiscal health and well-being of a community. Tax challenges are reduced. Local budget directors can make more accurate spending plans.</p>
        <p>But it seems that no matter how many local assessors' offices distribute pamphlets trying to explain this very point, the prospect of a revaluation immediately sends property owners and the politicians who represent them into a frenzy. Who will win out, by paying lower taxes, and who will lose, by paying more?</p>
        <p>This mind-set was certainly the case this month in East Meadow, on Long Island, when the Nassau County assessor, Charlie O'Shea, attended a meeting of the local Chamber of Commerce to discuss the impending revaluation. Before the meeting, Mr. O'Shea predicted a friendly crowd because East Meadow would get lower taxes.</p>
        <p>''All reports here have shown that they will benefit from a reassessment,'' he said. At the meeting, questions from local business owners quickly focused on how they would be affected. Rather than stressing the equity of an update, Mr. O'Shea made clear that East Meadow would ''make out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Shea, a former state legislator, said he hoped to move to an annual cycle after Nassau's revaluation is completed in 2003. Recognizing the benefits, New York State now offers an incentive -- $5 in state aid per parcel of property -- to local governments that revalue annually. About 250 districts have expressed interest, said Thomas G. Griffen, executive director of the State Office of Real Property Services.</p>
        <p>The incentive program requires the physical inspection and reappraisal of property at least every six years -- a practice that some assessors, including the New York State Assessors Association, say should be state law.</p>
        <p>New York City now updates its property assessments annually by using a sampling of inspections and statistical estimates. The city has won praise for trying to stay up to date, but critics caution that estimates are no substitute for physical inspections.</p>
        <p>Inspecting every property can be expensive, costing tens of millions of dollars in large tax districts. But computers and mass appraising techniques now make it possible to conduct fairly accurate revaluations without the cost of hiring inspectors.</p>
        <p>Greenwich, Conn., an affluent town with a robust residential and commercial tax base, has a tradition of maintaining a low tax rate. Its current revaluation, using every available technological tool, demonstrates how a diligent local government can keep pace with even a fast-changing real estate market.</p>
        <p>Among the tools Greenwich employs are computerized maps, with overlays showing wetlands and other areas that might affect property values; aerial photographs of the town that show construction changes not visible from the street; and a constantly updated database of property sales.</p>
        <p>As part of a revaluation about to be completed, Greenwich is taking digital photographs of every residential and commercial property in town, making comparisons easier. And, where many municipalities would use a single assessing firm, Greenwich is using at least five, each with different specialties. One, for instance, is assigned to assess golf courses.</p>
        <p>Still, the town assessor, Harriet S. Gotz, sees room for improvement. ''Ideally, I would prefer to do every year,'' she said. ''I would love to move toward having an annual revaluation.''</p>
        <p>Cathy L. Conklin, the chairwoman of the multitown task force overseeing the revaluation in Rockland County, said New York State could improve simply by passing a law that requires revaluations at some regular interval.</p>
        <p>Inequities in school taxes, which make up a large portion of the property tax, seemed to develop in Rockland because towns with shared school districts had revalued at different times. Clarkstown, for example, last revalued in 1985, while the town of Ramapo had not revalued since the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>''To have some sort of a cycle bill in place that essentially mandates that assessments have got to be at least in the same decade with each other would make sense,'' Ms. Conklin said.</p>
