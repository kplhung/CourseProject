        <p>As if dipped in amber, the old hotels seem frozen in time. Inside, the mostly elderly men seem from another time, as well. Some of them planned to flop down for a few nights and stayed for 50 or 60 years.</p>
        <p>Walk up a steep, narrow flight of stairs in one hotel, the Andrew's, at 197 Bowery. Look into its dim lobby. It is like a yellowing photograph. Smoke hangs in the dank air. The cigar-stained walls are a smudgy green. Wooden chairs are lined in neat rows across the patterned-tile floor. Grizzled denizens peer out dirty windows onto the wide street and wonder where the years went. Time seems to operate oddly there.</p>
        <p>The men inhabit a world in Lower Manhattan that is fading fast, but that has been captured in a new book celebrated at a reading at the Bowery Mission the other night. Their homes are in flophouses with names like the Sunshine, the Providence and the Prince, indistinguishable amid the metamorphosing mile-long stretch of the Bowery that was once the nation's most infamous skid row.</p>
        <p>Poetry and dignity can be found in just about every corner if the search is hard enough. The stories of the men in the flophouses are chronicled in a new book, ''Flophouse: Life on the Bowery,'' (Random House), by two documentary producers, David Isay and Stacy Abramson, and a photographer, Harvey Wang.</p>
        <p>The authors say that eight flophouses, officially known as lodging houses, that cost from $4.50 to $15 a night remain on the Bowery. Fewer than a thousand people stay in them.</p>
        <p>But before World War II, tens of thousands of men slept in the nearly 100 flophouses that lined the Bowery. The cubicles in which they lived were 4 by 6 feet and 7 feet high, smaller than prison cells, with no toilets or kitchens. The walls between the cubicles extended only part way to the ceiling, so each cubicle was topped with chicken wire to thwart residents called lush divers from jumping from one room to another and robbing a possibly passed-out neighbor.</p>
        <p>With the end of World War II, the authors wrote, the flophouses began to empty as returning veterans were greeted by the G.I. Bill and other new programs that left fewer of them homeless. A change in the city's housing code in 1955 also outlawed the construction of such cubicles.</p>
        <p>Whether the decline of the flophouses is good or bad, or simply just a change, is not a debate taken up by the authors.</p>
        <p>''We don't have a social agenda to suggest that they shouldn't exist or should,'' Mr. Isay said at the reading. '' It's more of a document, a record, a social history.''</p>
        <p>The book began as a radio documentary that was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1998 about one flophouse, the Sunshine Hotel. For the book, the authors interviewed 50 men who stay in four flophouses on the Bowery.</p>
        <p>The authors say that each flophouse is like a self-contained society, with its own distinctive character, clientele and internal economy. Most of the residents are permanent, and some of them, for example, pay fellow residents to perform small tasks.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere at the Sunshine might be described as carnivalesque. Bruce Davis, 51, can be found in the lobby, seated in the lotus position, airing his views on a multitude of subjects. Mr. Davis runs as many as 35 errands a day for other residents, such as trying to buy hard liquor on a Sunday.</p>
        <p>He recalled what led to his move into the Sunshine about 10 years ago. ''I didn't want to have nothing to do with nobody,'' he said in a soft Tennessee accent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said of the place, ''It wasn't what I wanted, but I had my troubles.''</p>
        <p>That afternoon, the hotel's manager, Nathan Smith, was preparing to visit a resident, a former heroin user, who was in the hospital waiting to undergo a leg amputation. A sign on a wall in the hotel lobby said that the resident welcomed visitors, ''especially those who owe him money.''</p>
        <p>The hotel and other flophouses are a haven for loners and men who want to drop out of life, the authors said. Mr. Smith said that many residents at the Sunshine had emotional disorders, and that the hotel is used as a dumping ground by psychiatric hospitals.</p>
        <p>Not far down the street stands the White House Hotel. According to the authors, the hotel was said to have earned its name because it accepted only whites for most of its history. The flophouses, which opened around the turn of the last century, were at one time almost entirely populated by white men. Now, the White House and the Sunshine are the most diverse in race and age.</p>
        <p>A business card from the White House, a four-story hotel that opened in 1917, indicates just how much the skid-row Bowery has changed. The card states that the hotel is geared toward students and backpackers, and on a recent afternoon, a few women, including one with a backpack, were staying there.</p>
        <p>The Andrew's Hotel, though, remains the most timeless of all. It is home to old-timers like John Knudsen, 82, who said he moved there in 1941. Mr. Knudsen recalled how he used to wait at the window, and would leap to his feet when he saw the truck picking up day laborers pull up. ''People didn't hang around back then,'' he explained. ''Everyone had a job.''</p>
        <p>He is resigned to spending the rest of his days at the Andrew's, looking out the window.''What are you going to do? There's no place to go,'' Mr. Knudsen said, working a lighted Marlboro between his fingers.</p>
        <p>Mike Gatto, the 80-year-old owner and manager of the Andrew's, said he doubted that the hotel would survive after he retired. He said there was no future in the business. In any event, he said, flophouse residents have plenty of places to go -- public housing, hospitals and cemeteries.</p>
