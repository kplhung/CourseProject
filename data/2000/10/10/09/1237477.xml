        <p>Ray Lucas was done with his first drive after conducting just two plays, and he headed straight for his friend. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde still had his helmet on and Lucas was kidding with him, thinking Testaverde was going to return to the game on the next possession. Then he saw a trainer shaking his head.</p>
        <p>Testaverde was done, and Lucas, who had spelled Testaverde for just one drive this season, in the Tampa Bay game two weeks ago, was back in the role he grabbed last season, thrown into the fire when Testaverde was hurt.</p>
        <p>Lucas helped the Jets to salvage last season, going 6-3 as a starter, and he was so good that the conventional wisdom was that the Jets were being unfair when they did not offer Lucas the big contract he expected after last season.</p>
        <p>But as daunting as last year's task was -- Testaverde was out for the season and Lucas was not even the entrenched backup when the 1999 season began -- Lucas never had a game with statistics as poor as today's.</p>
        <p>He completed 13 of 25 passes for just 99 yards. He threw no touchdowns and was intercepted twice. The first interception happened at the Jets' 49-yard line as they were driving deep from their territory for the first time in the game. But just two plays after the Jets' first first down of the game, Lucas was picked off. The ball was returned to the Jets' 18-yard line, and the Pittsburgh Steelers kicked a field goal to take a lead they would never be in danger of losing in their 20-3 victory.</p>
        <p>Testaverde tried to encourage Lucas on the sideline. ''He said to do what I do, when I start scrambling,'' Lucas said. ''He said: 'That's your game. Don't let anybody else get inside your mind. Make your own decisions and if you don't like it, take off.' ''</p>
        <p>Lucas admitted that he was stunned when he saw Testaverde on the ground and that his overexcitement contributed to poor throwing.</p>
        <p>''When I first got in there, I was really, really excited,'' Lucas said. ''That's my mentality. Calming down is when you get hit in the mouth, and I didn't get hit in the mouth real early. A couple of balls sailed on me. I was overanxious. After a while I settled down, but we still didn't get anything done on offense.''</p>
        <p>Lucas overthrew receivers on several occasions, and there were at least three passes that were nearly picked off in addition to the two that were. At one point in the second quarter, Lucas wildly overthrew receiver Wayne Chrebet. The ball sailed high and Chrebet swung around, waving his arms in frustration.</p>
        <p>Chrebet left the locker room before anyone could ask him about the play. But his frustration was shared by Lucas. On the next play he ran up the middle, and the official threw a flag for offensive holding as Lucas passed by. When Lucas was brought down near the 5-yard line, he smacked the ground repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Although Testaverde's injury has been a nagging one, Lucas did not do much work last week because Testaverde expected to play normally.</p>
        <p>Lucas's teammates, with whom Lucas is very popular, expressed their support for him afterward, saying that they had complete confidence in him and that the loss of Testaverde did not radically change the complexion of the game for them.</p>
        <p>''We've been without Vinny before,'' Marcus Coleman said. ''And we handled it pretty well. That shouldn't even be an excuse.''</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh absolved Lucas of much of the blame.</p>
        <p>''The other team played well and he didn't play as well as he would have liked,'' Groh said. ''Ray is very capable of doing everything we have in the plan. This game wasn't about Ray. It was about we got beat physically in the game.''</p>
        <p>Don't tell Lucas that. He has always been honest about himself, and today his performance provided him plenty of ammunition. When asked how he felt after the game, he replied: ''I don't think I can speak like that. You can't print it, anyway. A lot is expected of me as the No. 2 quarterback, to put points on the board. And it didn't happen today. You've got to look at yourself in the mirror.''</p>
