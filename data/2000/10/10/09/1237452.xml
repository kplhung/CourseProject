        <p>The personal computer industry, whose double-digit growth helped propel technology stocks for years, finally faces stiff competition -- from personal computers.</p>
        <p>Lately, it has become increasingly hard to sell consumers and corporations new computers because so many consumers and businesses already own them. Some analysts see signs of market saturation that could portend the end of the glory days for PC makers and their suppliers.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks Intel, Apple and Dell have seen their stocks tumble after warning that demand for computers is lighter than anticipated. The tepid forecasts have dampened investor expectations for the coming quarterly financial reports from those companies and others in the PC food chain.</p>
        <p>When Apple issued its warning, its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, described it as ''a speed bump.'' But some industry analysts say the warnings, taken together and coupled with other evidence, suggest something more fundamental is behind the slower demand. They say the personal computer market, especially the corporate market, is so saturated the industry can no longer assume sales will grow at annual rates of 15 or 20 percent or more to which it has grown accustomed.</p>
        <p>''We've run out of room for growth,'' said Martin Reynolds, research fellow at Gartner Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif. ''Look at the saturation in the market. We're there. We're filled up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reynolds even predicts the PC market, rather than simply seeing slower growth, could actually contract by the year 2002.</p>
        <p>The financial and product analysts who see market saturation say the shift does not yet mark the dreaded dawn of the so-called post-PC era, in which the use of personal computers would be usurped by other handheld computers and other gadgets. Rather, they see the beginning of the replacement-PC era.</p>
        <p>''The corporate market has become a replacement market,'' said Anne Bui, a senior analyst with the International Data Corporation, or IDC, a research house. ''There's no reason to buy anything now. They've bought everything they need.''</p>
        <p>The figures for saturation levels of the home market vary. Estimates from various market research firms indicate that from 53 to 60 percent of the nation's households now have computers, and some analysts expect greater penetration levels to be reached only gradually.</p>
        <p>Since 1994, annual sales of computers in the United States have increased at a torrid pace. As recently as 1999, sales soared 23.8 percent, to 45 million computers, up from 36 million in 1998, according to IDC.</p>
        <p>But for the current year, IDC is projecting a growth rate of only 12.2 percent in the United States market. That would be the lowest annual percentage rise since 1994, the earliest year for which IDC provides statistics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Bui said that the computer market might begin taking on the cyclical and seasonal traits typical of other industries. Computer sales, for example, could ebb and flow with standard replacement cycles, or be pegged more directly to new software releases.</p>
        <p>To be sure, not all analysts see systemic changes at work. Some say it is simply too soon to read anything into the recent warnings or even IDC's slow-growth projections for 2000.</p>
        <p>And they point out that PC sales have had their ebbs and flows over the last five years. For instance, worldwide sales slipped to 12.8 percent in 1998, according to IDC, but rebounded dramatically, by 23.6 percent, the very next year.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that in our industry's history we've seen times when supply has caught up to demand,'' said Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information Services Inc., a consulting firm in Santa Fe, N.M.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merrin said he believed that oil prices, among other factors, are slowing the economy and that the drag on computer sales is ''a 9-  to 18-month situation.''</p>
        <p>Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said PC makers and their investors should take heart that IDC, even while projecting 12.2 percent growth in the United States market this year, projects worldwide sales at 18.9 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy said that roughly 435 million PC's had been installed worldwide to date, which he estimated as only one-fifth the total that will be installed in the coming years. ''Before this whole revolution is over, there will be 2.5 billion computers shipped worldwide,'' he predicted.</p>
        <p>Where Mr. Murphy does agree with Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Bui is in saying that the weakness in the euro is hurting PC sales. Another factor that some analysts say has clouded the figures this year is the slow uptake of Microsoft's Windows 2000 software.</p>
        <p>Steve P. Kleynhans, a vice president at the Meta Group, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn., said many corporations were testing Windows 2000 on ''hundreds'' of new computers before rolling them out on ''thousands'' of upgraded computers. ''I don't see this as a long-term problem,'' Mr. Kleynhans said. ''It's a short-term problem hitting for a couple of quarters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kleynhans said it was misleading to draw an industry conclusion from the combined warnings of Dell, Intel and Apple, which he said were each dealing with different factors.</p>
        <p>Intel, he said, which warned analysts on Sept. 21 that its third-quarter revenues would not meet the company's earlier expectations, was facing newfound competition from its chip-making rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and was not executing as well as it could be.</p>
        <p>And he said that Dell's sales were a victim of the sluggish acceptance of Windows 2000. Last week, Dell warned that revenue for its fiscal third quarter would be 3 percent below previous forecasts.</p>
        <p>Only in the case of Apple does Mr. Kleynhans see ''a fairly saturated market,'' noting that the Macintosh faithful ''all have machines.'' On Sept. 28, Apple said it would earn 30 to 33 cents a share in its fourth quarter, far below analysts' forecast of 45 cents.</p>
        <p>Charles R. Wolf, executive director at the investment bank UBS Warburg, who closely follows the PC industry, said all PC makers need to realize that their industry has matured -- that they have successfully saturated the European and American business markets and now must concentrate on becoming a replacement industry.</p>
        <p>He said PC makers could still find growth selling to households -- not only because that market is not yet saturated, but because households often purchase more than one computer.</p>
        <p>Short term, as investors and analysts await further details from the PC industry as companies report financial results in coming weeks, stocks could be in for further punishment. Mr. Wolf said investors seem to be saying, ''PC sales are slowing and there seems to be no bottom.''</p>
