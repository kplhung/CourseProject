        <p>The fortresslike bakery was founded nine decades ago by an immigrant from Italy who sold bread from a bake shop in a barn. The founder, John Joseph Cassone, prospered by offering baked goods to fellow immigrants in a town that then, as now, had an earthier, more working-class feel than the rest of Westchester County.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the J. J. Cassone Bakery has grown into a modern giant with 250 employees, several 100-foot-long ovens and an elaborate system of conveyors, mixing machines and steam-filled vats. Its 100-yard-long, red-brick walls dominate a neighborhood where two families often squeeze into a single home and immigrants from Latin America have supplanted those from Italy.</p>
        <p>Now, this sizable industrial enterprise finds itself in an unusually fierce labor battle between management and union. In the sprawling, sweaty room at the heart of the bakery, some workers complain about scorching temperatures, on-the-job injuries and compulsory 72-hour weeks. Some workers -- almost all the workers are immigrants, many of them illegal -- say co-workers sometimes faint from heat and exhaustion.</p>
        <p>''I came to the United States because it was the country of my dreams, but at this point it's turned into a nightmare,'' said Roberto Lostaunau, a 39-year-old from Peru who is a leader in an effort to unionize the bakery's workers. ''This is a nightmarish company.''</p>
        <p>His view is not shared by all. For some workers at the bakery, like Antonio Torres, an immigrant from El Salvador who works from 4:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. placing bread and bagels into the ovens, the long hours provide the paycheck he needs to support his family.</p>
        <p>''When you work a lot of hours, you make a lot of money,'' Mr. Torres said.</p>
        <p>The labor battle at Cassone (pronounced kuh-SOHN) has become a national cause for the union movement, and underscores labor's stepped-up efforts to organize more immigrants, including illegal ones. But the Cassone battle pits immigrant against immigrant, with some looking to the union as the savior for their problems in the workplace, while others see it as an unwelcome intruder.</p>
        <p>Seemingly out of place in genteel Westchester, the dispute is exceptional for its bitterness. So far, it has involved firings, litigation, unionization votes and divisions among immigrants who come from the same countries, but who have very different sensibilities and desires. The battle reflects the labor movement's hopes -- and problems -- in dealing with a fast-changing labor force in which legal and illegal immigrants account for an ever-larger share of the working population.</p>
        <p>Convinced that immigrants are ripe for labor's message, union officials have devoted extensive manpower to try to organize the bakery's workers, who they say are horribly exploited. But to labor's surprise and chagrin, many of the immigrant workers praise Cassone's 72-hour weeks and even its modest wages, viewing them as the key to achieving their American dream of buying a house and a family car.</p>
        <p>Several immigrant workers said management used an especially worrisome tactic to keep the union out. They said supervisors threatened to call in the Immigration and Naturalization Service to clean out the place if the workers voted to unionize -- something management has denied. In recent years, unions have had a hard time unionizing workplaces with many illegal immigrants because these workers are often fearful of deportation and reprisals by management.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the labor war in working-class Port Chester grows out of tensions roiling just beneath the surface of Westchester's affluence. As in other wealthy suburbs, the county's economy is increasingly relying on immigrant laborers. But for these workers, it is often a daunting challenge to make ends meet in a county where housing, and so much else, is so expensive.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the unionization drive is the alluring pitch that a union contract could provide such large pay increases that the bakery's employees would need to work just 40 hours a week, not 72, to support their families and begin their climb to the middle class.</p>
        <p>But several workers at Cassone said the union has misunderstood the immigrants' desires and work ethic. Indeed, the main reason that several workers gave for voting against unionization was the fear that a contract would limit them to 40 hours a week. Mr. Torres said that thanks to the 72-hour weeks, he has been able to buy a house, support his wife and three children and take a two-week family vacation to Disney World.</p>
        <p>''If you work just 40 hours a week, there's no way you can afford a vacation like that,'' said Mr. Torres,  who has worked at the bakery for 11 years. ''Do you think you can work 40 hours a week and still buy a house?''</p>
        <p>For most of the bakery's workers, pay runs from $6.50 to $11 an hour, which translates to about $13,500 to $23,000 a year, based on a 40-hour workweek. But for a 72-hour week, with time-and-a-half pay for overtime, those hourly earnings add up to $29,000 to $49,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Officials from the Bakery and Confectionary Workers Union, the labor group that is trying to organize Cassone, say that if management paid the $11 to $15 an hour that some unionized bakeries offer, the employees would not need to work 72-hour weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lostaunau, the union supporter, has a far grimmer view of the bakery and its long hours than Mr. Torres does. Mr. Lostaunau, who spent 20 years working for a Peruvian oil company before moving to New York, complained about earning $7.10 an hour, about the exhausting hours, and about the withering heat from working alongside an oven. He also complained of injuring his left shoulder when he slipped on a floor slick from water and flour.</p>
        <p>He tensed up, his expression turning angry, as he described an episode several months ago in which he was not scheduled to take a break for five hours. After four hours of loading loaves into the oven, he recalled, he left his work station to use the bathroom, not being able to wait any longer. Mr. Lostaunau, who was working the 3 a.m.-to-3 p.m. shift, said his boss told him he was being fired for leaving his oven without permission, even though he said he had found a co-worker to substitute for him.</p>
        <p>''My boss was yelling and screaming and cursing at me, and he told me, 'You're fired,' '' Mr. Lostaunau said, noting that his boss, after cooling down, reduced the punishment to a three-day suspension.</p>
        <p>Marc L. Silverman, the bakery's lawyer, denied that Mr. Lostaunau had been punished for merely going to the bathroom. He said Mr. Lostaunau had been punished for taking 15 minutes to go, and for not having someone substitute for him.</p>
        <p>J. J. Cassone's managers said that the bakery was a contented place and that the union had manipulated immigrant workers into maligning their employer.</p>
        <p>''If they're trying to make us out to be the bakery equivalent of a sweatshop and a labor law violator, they're dead wrong,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''Many of our employees are happy. They can work substantial hours and can make $35,000 and up a year in what is basically a minimum-wage industry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman said the workers did not want a union. He pointed to last December's election, in which 118 workers voted against joining the union and 37 voted in favor of joining.</p>
        <p>Union officials said the election had been poisoned by what they insisted was illegal behavior by management. They said management had fired four of the most outspoken union supporters to chop the head off the organizing drive and to scare other workers. They said management threatened to close the bakery if the workers backed a union.</p>
        <p>Federal law prohibits companies from firing workers or retaliating in any other way for supporting a union.</p>
        <p>Several workers said management's most effective weapon was its threat to have illegal immigrant workers deported if they voted to unionize.</p>
        <p>''They would tell us they're going to fire us if the union wins,'' said a pencil-thin illegal immigrant from Guatemala, who would give only his first name, Antonio. ''They'd say they're going to get rid of all the undocumented people. That made a lot of people very afraid.''</p>
        <p>The union has pointed to such threats in urging the National Labor Relations Board to overturn December's election. Yet some workers back management's version of events.</p>
        <p>''Nobody talked about getting rid of the undocumented workers,'' said Gustavo Cardenas, 37, an immigrant from Mexico who works in shipping and receiving. ''That's a lie.''</p>
        <p>Jose Mario Castro, a 33-year-old from El Salvador, said he concluded that a union was needed soon after he began working at Cassone seven years ago. Most weeks, he put in 67 hours a week cleaning the machinery, often working months at a time without a day off.</p>
        <p>''For five and a half years, I worked seven days a week,'' Mr. Castro said. ''I had no days off. We need a union because of the very low wages and for better treatment. Nobody can complain by themselves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Castro said management fired him in April after he arrived at work a half-hour late. Workers are rarely punished for minor lateness, he said, asserting that he was dismissed because he had campaigned for the union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman said all the fired workers were dismissed for legitimate reasons, like lateness.</p>
        <p>Many workers say no union is needed because the bakery provides pensions, sick days and four-week vacations to longtime workers.</p>
        <p>''This is the best job around,'' said Mr. Cardenas, the shipping worker. ''The union can't give me anything that I can't get from the company.''</p>
