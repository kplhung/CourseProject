        <p>MANY an Internet retailer has assumed that one of the quickest paths to profitability is to sell expensive goods: the higher the price, the higher the profit margin. Such simple math lured a swarm of so-called luxury goods retailers onto the Web last year, and also led merchants like Amazon.com to expand into sales of items like $600 power tools.</p>
        <p>But with the exception of computer electronics and airline tickets, high-price goods have not been fast to catch on among Web shoppers. Analysts say the reasons go beyond the consumer's need to try on a Rolex watch, for instance, or actually hear a Nakamichi stereo system before hitting the ''buy'' button. The problem is often more fundamental: they can't pay for it.</p>

        <p>MANY an Internet retailer has assumed that one of the quickest paths to profitability is to sell expensive goods: the higher the price, the higher the profit margin. Such simple math lured a swarm of so-called luxury goods retailers onto the Web last year, and also led merchants like Amazon.com to expand into sales of items like $600 power tools.</p>
        <p>But with the exception of computer electronics and airline tickets, high-price goods have not been fast to catch on among Web shoppers. Analysts say the reasons go beyond the consumer's need to try on a Rolex watch, for instance, or actually hear a Nakamichi stereo system before hitting the ''buy'' button. The problem is often more fundamental: they can't pay for it.</p>
        <p>American consumers are carrying more debt on their credit cards than at any time in history -- an average of $8,000 a card holder, according to the research firm IDC. And so consumers frequently lack the available credit to make a big purchase online, analysts say. And though e-tailers have adopted nearly every merchandising and marketing gimmick of their offline counterparts this year, they have been slow to give customers payment options other than credit cards -- in particular, extended payment plans -- that are the the hallmarks of many traditional retailers.</p>
        <p>But that is starting to change, for two reasons. High-price Web merchants who are staring at what could be their last holiday season are desperately trying to eliminate any barriers to completing a sale, and they have identified lack of consumer credit as one such barrier. Perhaps more important, companies like NextCard and eCredit are now able to help solve the problem, by allowing merchants to check a consumer's credit application almost instantly and offer extended payment plans during the checkout process.</p>
        <p>''If you look at e-commerce and where it's stopped, it's that people are having difficulty putting purchases over $500 on their credit card,'' said Jennifer Blackmore, an analyst at IDC. She said that the typical credit card user had between $500 and $1,000 of available credit at any given time. So when it comes to high-price purchases, Ms. Blackmore said, ''they either don't want to max out their cards, or they just don't have enough credit.''</p>
        <p>Executives of GetPlugged.com, an online retailer of premium audio and video equipment, say they understand this problem. GetPlugged, which sells items ranging from a $599 home theater ensemble to a $20,000 plasma screen monitor, intends to offer extended payment to its customers later this month.</p>
        <p>''People may have other plans for their existing credit, or they may want to go with 90 days same as cash,'' said Howie Diamond, vice president for sales. ''That way, if they buy something now, they could pay it off in February with tax refunds or a holiday bonus. It's a very meaningful offer for consumers.''</p>
        <p>GetPlugged will be using a new system created by NextCard, which issues Visa-brand credit cards and processes credit card payments for merchants.</p>
        <p>The new system will allow NextCard to  pump more dollars into its existing financing system, while giving consumers an alternative to credit cards. According to NextCard's vice president for consumer finance, Richard Goebel, consumers who are offered extended payment plans receive credit applications on the e-tailer's checkout page.</p>
        <p>The applicant, Mr. Goebel said, discloses his or her Social Security number, income, mortgage amount and lender, ''and within 30 seconds we return an approval with the size of the credit line.''</p>
        <p>Between 40 and 45 percent of the applicants will be approved, a company spokesman predicted, at interest rates of 13.9 percent to 29 percent, based on the perceived credit risk. John Hashman, NextCard's chief executive, said that online retailers would pay nothing for the service, and that the transaction fees for merchants -- 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent -- would be identical to those charged on normal credit card payments that NextCard processed. He said the service would take from two weeks to two months for each merchant to put into place.</p>
        <p>Of course, NextCard is not the only company offering such a service; nor is it the first. ECredit, for one, started offering extended payment terms to e-commerce companies on a limited basis in 1998. Peter McKay, eCredit's president, said that the company had seen increasing interest among e-tailers as the year progressed. ''It's a no-lose proposition for them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>ECredit's system differs from NextCard's, in that it can route an application to several different lenders while the applicant waits online, increasing the chances of an approval and decreasing the amount of control one lender can have over an e-tailer's credit offerings. Mr. McKay said an applicant would wait ''a couple of minutes'' at most for an answer.</p>
        <p>Not only can retailers make more sales with the extended credit plans, Mr. McKay said, but they can keep more revenue than they do on normal credit card purchases. That is because the transaction fees of eCredit's lenders range from 0 to 2 percent for extended payment purchases. And he said that even though eCredit charged an additional transaction fee, merchants still pay less than the industry average of 2.5 to 4 percent for online credit card payment processing.</p>
        <p>Still, merchants must spend $10,000 to $50,000 for technology and installation of the system, and eCredit selects only merchants that it expects to generate the most transaction fees in the long term.</p>
        <p>One such company is Hearts On Fire, which sells diamonds through its own site and through a network of 400 independent jewelry retailers. Avner Arazi, the company's director of e-commerce, said Hearts On Fire would begin offering extended payment plans before the holiday season, and would offer the program to both its online customers and to those who buy from the company's retail affiliates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arazi says that traditional jewelry stores are able to approve only 20 percent of those who apply for extended credit, mostly because merchants tend to deal with only one lender. But because eCredit works with many lenders, Mr. Arazi said he expected an 80 percent approval rate. Glenn Rothman, the company's chief executive, added: ''Who knows whether or not tht will actually happen. But if eCredit can do that, I really have a competitive advantage.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to using extended credit plans to generate profit, no company may be more successful than the computer maker Gateway. Bruce Broll, senior manager of business processes for Gateway's financial services group, said the company had no extended payment plan for its customers in 1997. But after setting up one, the company quickly saw 20 percent of its customers sign up. Now, using a variety of lenders, Gateway gets $2 billion of its overall revenues of $9 billion from interest and other fees from extended financing plans, Mr. Broll said.</p>
        <p>He declined to say how much of that financing revenue came from Gateway's Web operation, but he did say the company's extended payment system had been handled by eCredit since mid-1998, before eCredit made its system widely available. In addition to routing an undisclosed percentage of applicants to Gateway's own financing division, eCredit sends the applicants to other lenders, who pay Gateway a finder's fee for each, because Gateway delivers so much business to them.</p>
        <p>And because eCredit's multilender system allowed Gateway to offer different financing terms to different customers -- and thereby cut down on credit rejections -- Mr. Broll said, company sales increased. ''The way it was,'' he said, ''the lender could pick and choose, if you know what I mean.''</p>
