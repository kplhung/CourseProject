        <p>Cold cream packaged in what looks like a condom wrapper? If it's novel, it must be Prada. On Oct. 15, Prada, based in Milan, will introduce to its American stores, as well as to Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue, a Prada Beauty line of skin-care products. Instead of being sold in conventional bottles or jars, the creams, face masks and lip balms will come in individual, foil-wrapped packets. They will be sold in boxes, ideally to take you through a month of maintenance.</p>
        <p>''Basically, the idea was to make the treatment very personal,'' Miuccia Prada said on Sept. 30, as she rummaged for a packet of lip balm from her tweed handbag, which not only was endearingly messy, but also had a big safety pin stuck on the outside. ''We used the little packages so each day you can treat yourself, depending on how you feel.''</p>

        <p>Cold cream packaged in what looks like a condom wrapper? If it's novel, it must be Prada. On Oct. 15, Prada, based in Milan, will introduce to its American stores, as well as to Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue, a Prada Beauty line of skin-care products. Instead of being sold in conventional bottles or jars, the creams, face masks and lip balms will come in individual, foil-wrapped packets. They will be sold in boxes, ideally to take you through a month of maintenance.</p>
        <p>''Basically, the idea was to make the treatment very personal,'' Miuccia Prada said on Sept. 30, as she rummaged for a packet of lip balm from her tweed handbag, which not only was endearingly messy, but also had a big safety pin stuck on the outside. ''We used the little packages so each day you can treat yourself, depending on how you feel.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Prada, whose husband, Patrizio Bertelli, is chief executive of the company, with nearly $2 billion in sales, agreed that the unusual packaging, along with the cachet of the Prada name, will be a selling advantage. But Ms. Prada added with a laugh: ''It's also a real pleasure to open one of these little packages, use it and then throw it away. It's sort of childish.''</p>
        <p>There is no plan to introduce makeup. ''Personally, I hope I don't have to do makeup, because I don't use it, and in the end, I have to do what I like,'' she said, breaking into another giggle. ''Also, I believe a lot in creams because they can't do any damage, and I need a lot of work.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Prada said that she and her husband rarely discussed business and that she didn't know what he intended to show on Oct. 4 on the Jil Sander runway. People familiar with that collection say it was designed by Mr. Bertelli, the photographer Manuela Pavesi and a stylist. Nor had she known in advance about plans to form a partnership with Azzedine Alaia, which had been announced earlier in September. ''He told me after he had done it,'' she said, adding: ''Azzedine is the only designer who really does something for an individual. I told him, 'Azzedine, I hope in the end, I will have a very sexy dress.' ''</p>
        <p>As for the Jil Sander line, Mr. Bertelli may have been putting on his best game face after the show when he said in a separate interview that the collection could be designed successfully by a team, and never referred to his own contribution. (Ms. Sander resigned from the label in January after disputes with Mr. Bertelli, who owns the controlling interest.) The talk in Milan is that Mr. Bertelli would like to find a way to get Ms. Sander back. The designer was apparently invited to the show, but she did not attend.</p>
