        <p>Like a college student who puts off studying until the week before exams, Congress is trying to cram a semester of work, including the passage of nine spending bills to keep the government running, into a frenetic four days beginning on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>With pressure mounting on lawmakers to return home to campaign, Republican leaders in Congress faced tough negotiations with the White House on three spending bills laden with politically charged issues, including abortion, gun control and education.</p>
        <p>Last week, Congress approved a compromise $58 billion spending bill for transportation and an $18.8 billion measure that paid for the Interior Department, the National Endowment for the Arts and the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington.</p>
        <p>House and Senate negotiators also agreed on a $79 billion measure for agriculture, and Senate leaders capitulated to the White House in a dispute over saving three endangered species in the Missouri River watershed. That dispute prompted President Clinton on Saturday to veto a $23.6 billion measure to pay for federal energy and water projects.</p>
        <p>Congressional and White House negotiators also made progress toward a $107.9 billion measure to finance veteran, housing, space and scientific research programs as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies. And they cleared the way for passage of a bill to finance the Treasury Department and several White House agencies.</p>
        <p>Still, in many ways, last week's work merely removed much of the legislative underbrush. Republican negotiators agreed to many of Mr. Clinton's spending requests, adding a number of their own and larding the bills with billions in special projects.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Republican-controlled Congress has been spending at a rate that may result in $20 billion more in spending than Mr. Clinton has asked for -- much to the chagrin of fiscal conservatives.</p>
        <p>This week lawmakers faced the difficult task of reaching an agreement with the White House on three major spending bills -- Labor-Health and Human Services, Foreign Operations and one for the Commerce, Justice and State departments -- that tended to have less pork-barrel spending and more politically charged policy disputes.</p>
        <p>''That's where the sticky wickets are,'' said Representative James T. Walsh, Republican of New York.</p>
        <p>In an election year with the presidency and control of the House and the Senate up for grabs, the issues in these three bills are sticky indeed.</p>
        <p>The measure to finance the Commerce, Justice and State Departments contained several contentious issues, including a provision that barred the Justice Department from receiving money from other agencies to help it pursue litigation against tobacco companies.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders said the Foreign Operations measure would be about $15 billion, the largest amount that Congress had approved for that bill in years, and would contain hefty increases to help poor nations relieve their debts and to fight AIDS in Africa. But a major fight loomed over a provision to bar international family planning organizations from using money to provide abortions in foreign countries or lobby foreign governments on abortion issues.</p>
        <p>A compromise reached last year allowed the president to waive the restrictions, but if he did so, the amount of money going to international family planning groups would be reduced.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders, eager to please anti-abortion advocates, said they would insist that last year's compromise remain in force.</p>
        <p>''I've got a commitment from the leadership that they will be firm, that last year's compromise will be this year's policy,'' said Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican and a leader of anti-abortion forces in the House.</p>
        <p>Advocates of abortion rights, who did not like the compromise, have pressed the White House to veto the bill if the restrictions on international family planning groups remained.</p>
        <p>But some advocates privately worried that given the bill's large increases for debt relief and AIDS prevention in Africa, Mr. Clinton might sign it anyway. They also worried that, if he should veto the bill, there would not be enough votes in the House to override it.</p>
        <p>Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, remained hopeful for a veto.</p>
        <p>''I believe the administration will hold firm,'' Ms. Maloney said, ''as they have indicated to me and many others they would.''</p>
        <p>Both sides are geared for a fight over the Labor-Health and Human Services bill -- the largest domestic spending bill. Among the most contentious items was a dispute over a proposal to provide federal aid to help school districts hire more teachers and to build or renovate school buildings.</p>
        <p>Congress has proposed $1.3 billion in grants and loans for school construction and $1.4 billion for teachers, close to what the administration wants. But unlike Mr. Clinton, Congress wants to give school districts the option of using the money for other purposes.</p>
        <p>Complicating an already nettlesome situation are other proposals that Congress or the administration would like to enact. Among them are an increase in the minimum wage, the repeal of a telephone excise tax, an expansion of hate crimes legislation, a proposal to restore more than $21 billion in Medicare cuts that were enacted three years ago and a plan to enhance medical benefits for military retirees that would cost an estimated $60 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>With time running out, many of these issues would have to be attached to spending bills if they are to be considered. Most legislators said they expected Congressional leaders would combine several of the remaining spending bills -- if not all of them -- into one comprehensive omnibus bill that would not only pay for the government but encompass several other issues -- perhaps the minimum wage, military health benefits and a telephone excise tax.</p>
        <p>''The way we're going now, it's going to be a good-looking omnibus,'' said Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the minority leader.</p>
