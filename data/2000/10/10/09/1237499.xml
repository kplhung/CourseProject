        <p>The second debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio was basically a draw. It lacked the divisive tone of last month's edgy encounter, and was free of those defining moments that sway voters, like Mr. Lazio's ill-conceived march across the stage in Buffalo. Instead, it consisted largely of business-like exchanges on the issues, with Mrs. Clinton displaying her customary mastery of detail and Mr. Lazio presenting a more statesmanlike demeanor.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was in command of the issues that have helped give her a lead in the latest polls, particularly abortion, where her support for a woman's right to choose is far stronger than Mr. Lazio's. She also gave special attention to the Supreme Court, whose future ''hangs in the balance.'' As senator, she promised to oppose any nominee who would trifle with ''fundamental constitutional rights,'' like abortion.</p>

        <p>The second debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio was basically a draw. It lacked the divisive tone of last month's edgy encounter, and was free of those defining moments that sway voters, like Mr. Lazio's ill-conceived march across the stage in Buffalo. Instead, it consisted largely of business-like exchanges on the issues, with Mrs. Clinton displaying her customary mastery of detail and Mr. Lazio presenting a more statesmanlike demeanor.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was in command of the issues that have helped give her a lead in the latest polls, particularly abortion, where her support for a woman's right to choose is far stronger than Mr. Lazio's. She also gave special attention to the Supreme Court, whose future ''hangs in the balance.'' As senator, she promised to oppose any nominee who would trifle with ''fundamental constitutional rights,'' like abortion.</p>
        <p>There were other key differences. Mrs. Clinton got it right about the public financing of campaigns, which she supports and Mr. Lazio opposes. But in opposing the construction of a new football stadium on New York's West Side, she prematurely closed the door on proposals to turn a listless part of the city into a vibrant business and entertainment zone. But both condemned a United Nations resolution implicitly blaming Israel for the recent Mideast violence. For Mrs. Clinton, this represented a break with the administration, which abstained on the resolution.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most noteworthy difference did not involve any single issue but, rather, the candidates' competing visions of what they would bring to New York. Mr. Lazio argued forcefully that New York needs one Republican senator to balance Charles Schumer, and to ensure that a Republican-led Senate would pay attention to New York's needs. Mrs. Clinton countered with the argument that Mr. Lazio would be forced to pay a heavy price for any concessions extracted on the state's behalf, including obedience to the wishes of conservatives like Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader.</p>
        <p>Given his perilous position in the polls, Mr. Lazio had the most to gain. He had hurt himself badly in Buffalo when he brandished a written pledge on soft money in Mrs. Clinton's face and challenged her to sign it. Mrs. Clinton began yesterday's debate by remarking lightly that she would not be ''coming to your podium today.'' For his part, Mr. Lazio was the soul of politeness. He also resisted an opportunity to exploit Mrs. Clinton's discomfort when she was asked why she has stayed married to President Clinton. Still, he finished his closing argument by saying, ''If you don't stand up for something, you'll put up with anything.'' This ambiguous remark immediately ignited speculation that Mr. Lazio could not, in the end, resist some reference to the first lady's personal predicament.</p>
        <p>The one clear exception to the morning's otherwise civil tone involved campaign financing. Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Lazio had been forced to correct an obvious violation of their agreement barring the use of outside money in their campaigns. ''If New Yorkers can't trust him to keep his word for 10 days,'' she said, '' how can they trust him for six years on issues like Social Security, Medicare, prescription drugs and education?'' Clearly stung, Mr. Lazio said he needed no lectures on campaign finance from ''Motel 1600,'' a reference to the many contributors to Mrs. Clinton's campaign who have stayed overnight in the White House.</p>
        <p>But this was a rare abrasive moment in an otherwise well-behaved and frequently illuminating exchange, not unlike the debate between the two vice-presidential candidates last week.</p>
