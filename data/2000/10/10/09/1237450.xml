        <p>One of the most interesting points in Philip Glass's Symphony No. 5 -- or, to be fair, the single interesting point -- came right at the end. The work was receiving its North American premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday evening, with Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Brooklyn Philharmonic, the Dessoff Choirs and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, and for more than an hour and a half it had been supplying the composer's usual earnest musical rudiments to clothe sacred writings from around the world in a 12-part history of the cosmos.</p>
        <p>''When space turned around, the earth heated'': di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. ''Let the day perish wherein I was born'': di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. ''May I be a protector for those without one'': di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. Always the same oscillation in the orchestra, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, with scales that might go up or down, or, as a surprise, up and down in the same phrase. Always, too, the same solemn chanting, whether from the choir or from the soloists (Kimberly E. Jones, Milagro Vargas, John McVeigh, Andre Solomon-Glover and Stephan MacLeod). And always, in addition, a deadening uniformity in the orchestration, with the threat or actuality of a Broadway-style overwhelming of the strings by brass, keyboards and percussion.</p>

        <p>One of the most interesting points in Philip Glass's Symphony No. 5 -- or, to be fair, the single interesting point -- came right at the end.

        <p>''When space turned around, the earth heated'': di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. ''Let the day perish wherein I was born'': di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. ''May I be a protector for those without one'': di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da. Always the same oscillation in the orchestra, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, with scales that might go up or down, or, as a surprise, up and down in the same phrase. Always, too, the same solemn chanting, whether from the choir or from the soloists (Kimberly E. Jones, Milagro Vargas, John McVeigh, Andre Solomon-Glover and Stephan MacLeod). And always, in addition, a deadening uniformity in the orchestration, with the threat or actuality of a Broadway-style overwhelming of the strings by brass, keyboards and percussion.</p>
        <p>Given that the symphony, in 12 movements, summarized the entirety of creation and human life, the homogeneity that was also found in the musical invention was perplexing. ''Dedication of Merit'' -- the last movement, a Buddhist prayer for peace to emanate from virtue -- did not sound so different from ''The Creation of Sentient Beings'' (the fourth movement) or, indeed, from most of the rest.</p>
        <p>Moments of difference stood out all the more. One came at the start of the seventh movement, ''Suffering,'' where the bass soloist took a theme from the Psalms -- ''My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'' -- and suddenly started to sound as if he meant it. The pathos was unwarranted and thereby sentimental.</p>
        <p>There was another exceptional passage at the start of a setting from the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' in the 10th movement, ''Judgment and Apocalypse.'' The noisome moral -- ''That you are suffering comes from your own actions; it is not due to anybody else'' -- was set as a jolly round, which was the only instance of counterpoint in the entire work. Admittedly it did not last long, but still.</p>
        <p>Yet another unusual idea was the violence in the middle of the ''Evil and Ignorance'' movement, underlined by Matthew Frey's lighting (a swinging white box), which was inventive and beautiful throughout.</p>
        <p>But none of these was the moment that counted. What mattered was that right at the end, with an emphatic conclusion in sight, Mr. Glass drew back, took his music into darker, more chromatic territory, had his choir re-enter in moaning disconsolateness, and only then moved toward his close. Irony is not his strong point, but here it seemed that he was, within his own work, undercutting its preposterous pretensions.</p>
