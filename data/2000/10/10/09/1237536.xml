        <p>Faced with the worst assault on Middle East peace since he entered the White House, President Clinton asked the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to convene an urgent summit meeting where Mr. Clinton could meet the leaders of Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan, a senior administration official said today.</p>

        <p>Faced with the worst assault on Middle East peace since he entered the White House, President Clinton asked the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to convene an urgent summit meeting where Mr. Clinton could meet the leaders of Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan, a senior administration official said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak did not immediately agree to the idea of a midweek regional summit meeting in Egypt, but said he would discuss it with Yasir Arafat when the Palestinian leader arrived in Cairo on Monday, officials said.</p>
        <p>While Israeli and Palestinian officials steered clear of broader confrontation today, some violence continued and both sides remained wary of further bloodshed.</p>
        <p>Jolted by the widening of the Middle East conflict to a second front, involving Lebanon and, less directly, Syria, Mr. Clinton also appealed by telephone today to the new Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, to secure the release of three Israeli soldiers captured by Islamic guerrillas of the Hezbollah movement, White House officials said.</p>
        <p>Above all, the administration struggled to relieve the pressure on Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, whose army was weighing a major strike against Lebanon and Syria, and who set a deadline of Monday night -- the end of the Yom Kippur holiday -- for the Palestinians to halt their uprising or face its suppression by ''all available means.''</p>
        <p>The rapid deterioration in the Middle East, which threatened to undo the peace accords of Mr. Clinton's two terms, was encapsulated in a United Nations resolution passed on Saturday night, with the United States abstaining. It criticized Israel for what it called excessive use of force against the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, said today, ''After extensive consultations within the government and with the Israelis, the president instructed me to abstain on the grounds that this was in the best interests of the United States and Israel.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the abstention was driven by the fear that an American veto of the resolution, which in its final version tamped down the criticism of Israel, would incite violence against American embassies or other installations in the region. They also were concerned that a veto would further inflame the already explosive mood in the Arab world.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Clinton, who starting on  Friday night cleared his schedule to deal with the Middle East crisis, one of the top worries was whether Mr. Barak's government could survive beyond Monday evening.</p>
        <p>The formation of any kind of national unity government, including the rightist politician Ariel Sharon as foreign minister, would complicate the administration's task of salvaging peace, officials indicated.</p>
        <p>Public opinion polls published in Israeli newspapers today showed Mr. Barak's approval rating at an all-time low of 30 percent. One poll, in the largest circulation paper, Yediot Aharonot, said 49 percent of Israelis believed that he had used too little force in the last 10 days, and 30 percent said he used the right amount.</p>
        <p>In calling for a summit meeting in Egypt, the White House was seeking to halt a chain of events that could slide into war and to find a way that would divert the Palestinians and Israelis from directly blaming each other for the worst violence since the signing of the Oslo accords in 1993.</p>
        <p>The situation had become so bad that the administration was no longer just salvaging its legacy of peacemaking. ''It is not only his legacy going up in flames, but U.S. interests in the region,'' an official said.</p>
        <p>All American embassies in the Middle East were closed over the weekend as a precaution against attacks. So far, there have been no evacuation orders, an official said.</p>
        <p>The goal of a summit meeting was ''to change the terrain, to look for something that would stop a chain reaction like August 1914,'' when the European powers ran pell-mell into World War I, an administration official said. To get this change of direction, Mr. Clinton needs to be involved. ''It has to be done in a dramatic way and at a high level,'' another American official said.</p>
        <p>The public stance of the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who appeared on network television news programs today, was that the violence has to stop so that peace talks can get back in stride.</p>
        <p>But privately, officials said the outlook was extremely bleak, with an Israeli public and army outraged by the confluence of three events: the destruction by Palestinians on Saturday of the holy site known as Joseph's Tomb; the kidnapping of three Israeli soldiers on the border with Lebanon; and the Palestinian uprising of the last 10 days.</p>
        <p>In Arab countries, the administration was concerned that street demonstrations against Israel would gather strength. In Jordan, King Abdullah, whose father, King Hussein, signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, has used tear gas in the last three days to disperse angry Palestinian demonstrators.</p>
        <p>The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, left for the region tonight in an effort to get all sides to retreat from belligerent threats.</p>
        <p>In calling Mr. Assad, the Syrian leader, and requesting his help to win the release of the three Israeli soldiers, Mr. Clinton was trying to relieve the pressure on Mr. Barak, who withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon in May.</p>
        <p>If the three soldiers are quickly returned, Mr. Barak may be able to restrain the determination in the Israeli Army to strike, a senior Administration official said. ''The prime minister took the risk of withdrawing forces from Lebanon and now he's in a situation where Hezbollah has crossed a United Nations approved line,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak therefore appeared to the Israeli Army and public as having ''bent over backwards to the Palestinians and to Lebanon and not gotten anything for it,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton told the Syrian leader that he held a ''unique role'' in Lebanon that he should use to extricate the Israeli soldiers, the official said.</p>
        <p>The administration official declined to characterize the response  beyond saying the Syrian described the situation as ''extremely volatile.'' The Hezbollah movement in Lebanon has been reported in the press there as suggesting a trade of the Israeli soldiers for Hezbollah prisoners held in Israel.</p>
        <p>At the United Nations, the administration weighed the options of vetoing the resolution criticizing Israel or abstaining from the vote. Until late Saturday, when the Americans won some concessions in the language against Israel, the administration would have had to veto the resolution, Mr. Holbrooke said.</p>
        <p>On Friday night, Mr. Clinton asked the Security Council to delay the vote for 24 hours so he could personally get involved, Mr. Holbrooke said. Before the delay, the president told Mr. Barak that the United States would veto, he said.</p>
        <p>Then came a change in some language and an amber light from the Israelis that an American abstention was acceptable, officials said. Mr. Holbrooke described the resolution as ''lousy'' and not at all reflecting the facts of a complicated situation in the region.</p>
        <p>But, he added, the resolution was entirely ''rhetoric,'' and hence did not materially affect matters.</p>
        <p>Middle East experts in the administration -- including Dennis B. Ross, the Middle East coordinator; George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence; and Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering -- had recommended abstaining. They believed that a veto could have caused more Arab violence and put American lives at stake in the region, officials said.</p>
        <p>Officials said they were distressed that Mr. Arafat, whom the administration has spent years wooing as a responsible statesman, had failed to respond in the aftermath of the Camp David summit meeting in July. And there was nervousness that Mr. Barak could not last much longer as prime minister.</p>
        <p>An administration official said today: ''This is not about salvaging  trophies of peace accords. This is about core foreign policy interests.''</p>
