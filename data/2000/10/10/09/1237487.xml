        <p>Answering Republican assaults on Vice President Al Gore, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman yesterday accused his rivals of ''nasty personal attacks,'' described Dick Cheney as an ''attack dog'' and even questioned Gov. George W. Bush's own veracity.</p>
        <p>It was a day when, in the round of Sunday talk shows, both camps became nasty and personal as the campaign reached a new level of incivility heading into the final four weeks, with polls showing Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush running neck and neck.</p>
        <p>On CNN's ''Late Edition,'' Mr. Lieberman drew a contrast between the cordial tone of his debate on Thursday with Mr. Cheney, the former defense secretary, and Mr. Cheney's remarks the next day, when he called Mr. Gore's proposals ''hogwash'' and ''double talk.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know who that Dick Cheney was at the debate on Thursday night,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''He was a rational, civil man and he goes back out and becomes an attack dog.''</p>
        <p>Republicans focused their attacks on Mr. Gore's misstatements of fact -- most recently, his statement in last Tuesday's debate that he had visited Texas during a period of wildfires with James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Gore has since acknowledged that he went to Texas not with the director of the agency, but with the deputy director.</p>
        <p>Two top Bush advisers -- Karl Rove, chief strategist, on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' and Karen P. Hughes, communications director, on ''Fox News Sunday'' -- called Mr. Gore ''a serial exaggerator.''</p>
        <p>''This is a man who has difficulty telling the truth,'' Mr. Rove said. ''He constantly exaggerates and embellishes.'' In the debate, he said, Mr. Gore had exaggerated ''about being at the Parker County fires.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Gore had said in the debate, ''I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.'' He never said he went to Parker County or to the fires.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman reminded viewers that Mr. Bush has had misstatements of his own, as when he cited ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' as a favorite childhood book -- though it was written when he was in his 20's. And he ripped into Mr. Bush's record as governor of Texas.</p>
        <p>Republicans countered that the Democrats were trying to distract voters' attention from Mr. Gore's own shortcomings.</p>
