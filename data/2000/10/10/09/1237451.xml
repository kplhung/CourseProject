        <p>Two Asian Women, Friends and Foes</p>
        <p>Joyce S. Lim and Nami Yamamoto  Dance Theater Workshop</p>
        <p>Joyce S. Lim and Nami Yamamoto cautiously inched closer and tried to join hands. Then they withdrew, only to draw nearer again.</p>
        <p>Such actions occurred throughout ''Wan Dollah?,'' the collaboratively choreographed work they performed on Thursday night. Much of the time they moved with mercurial lightness to a taped collage created by Guy Yarden that included music by Dick Lee and Kiyoko Suizenji. The dances were punctuated by dramatic sketches that provided the hourlong production with hints of social commentary.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lim identified herself as Malaysian-Chinese, Ms. Yamamoto as Japanese. Sometimes they seemed to be rivals; at other times they presented a united front against invisible opponents who, their text implied, disliked all Asians.</p>
        <p>They pretended to be contestants in a television game show dedicated to determining who is a ''real Asian'' and played ball with a gigantic fortune cookie. Once they announced, ''We are the same.'' Later Ms. Yamamoto declared, ''I'm not Asian; I'm Japanese.''</p>
        <p>More could have been made of the tensions between these viewpoints. The choreographers skimmed lightly over some thorny questions: To what extent do Asians of differing national backgrounds consider themselves allies? Conversely, to what extent do they discriminate against one another? How do the historical and cultural differences of nations in Asia affect the attitudes of Asians living in the United States? And should Asians here cling to traditions, reject them or move freely between old and new ways of living?</p>
        <p>Ms. Lim and Ms. Yamamoto introduced a multitude of ideas they never explored in depth. Nevertheless they were ideas worth pondering. And when, at the end, an unseen game-show announcer decided, ''Nobody is the real Asian,'' that conclusion suggested that the choreographers rejected rigid distinctions.</p>
        <p>''Wan Dollah?'' will be repeated on Saturday and Sunday at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea.</p>
        <p>Turning a Sculpture Into a Third Dancer</p>
        <p>Dana Tai Soon Burgess and Company  Kaye Playhouse</p>
        <p>Dancers danced. That was to be expected when Dana Tai Soon Burgess and Company appeared Saturday night. But a 12-foot-high sculpture also seemed to dance in the program, which the Washington-based troupe called ''Dana Tai Soon Burgess: Reflections in Motion.''</p>
        <p>The sculpture, by John Dreyfuss, was an active partner in Mr. Burgess's choreography for ''Helix.'' Gleaming in Jennifer Tipton's lighting, the structure at first resembled a bulbous vase. Wearing a simple costume by Han Feng, Mr. Burgess curled up on the floor near it and curved about it to a taped score by Christopher Nickels. Rising, he let his torso twist and his fingers quiver.</p>
        <p>He pressed himself against the sculpture, and when he pushed it around, it magically changed shape. Its surface was now dominated by a hole resembling the mouth of a cave. Mr. Burgess was replaced by Sarah Craft, who continued the choreography's flowing patterns. Then she and Mr. Burgess danced together, swiveling the sculpture once again so that one beheld several ridges and cavities in it. They approached the mysterious object and caressed it, as if trying to make themselves part of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burgess's choreography was unhurried. It even occasionally threatened to turn lulling. But its subtle changes and the very striking sculptural changes made ''Helix'' resemble a depiction of some eternally evolving force of nature.</p>
        <p>It was followed by ''Seidenstrasse (Silk Road Excerpts 1-5),'' fragments of a production that will receive its premiere next year. Mr. Burgess, Ms. Craft, Miyako Nitadori, Tati Valle-Riestra, Natalie Moffet Smith and Anne Stevens wore diaphanous costumes by Claudette Lopez-Beyer and swirled in an untroubled way to music by Thomas Otten.</p>
        <p>It was probably unwise to present this enigmatic work in progress rather than a completed production as a companion to ''Helix.'' But it did suggest that Mr. Burgess can devise attractively sinuous choreography.</p>
