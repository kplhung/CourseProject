        <p>On the day after he won both Breeders' Cup prep races on the grass at Belmont Park, the jockey Jean-Luc Samyn stayed red hot yesterday as he nudged Forbidden Apple home first by a neck over Affirmed Success in the $250,000 Kelso Handicap.</p>
        <p>It was the third victory in four starts for Forbidden Apple, a 5-year-old son of Pleasant Colony, who ran the mile race in 1:34 1/5. And it pointed him and his pursuers toward the $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile on Nov.4 at Churchill Downs.</p>

        <p>On the day after he won both Breeders' Cup prep races on the grass at Belmont Park, the jockey Jean-Luc Samyn stayed red hot yesterday as he nudged Forbidden Apple home first by a neck over Affirmed Success in the $250,000 Kelso Handicap.</p>
        <p>It was the third victory in four starts for Forbidden Apple, a 5-year-old son of Pleasant Colony, who ran the mile race in 1:34 1/5. And it pointed him and his pursuers toward the $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile on Nov.4 at Churchill Downs.</p>
        <p>Forbidden Apple stalked Affirmed Success until they were joined by Johnny Dollar and One Won One in the homestretch in a four-horse duel. At the finish, Forbidden Apple poked his neck in front of Affirmed Success, who held second place by a nose over Johnny Dollar and by less than a length over One Won One.</p>
        <p>Forbidden Apple ran a steady mile after going half a mile in 464&lt;diamond=5 seconds and three-quarters in 1:10 1/5. He paid $18.60 for a $2 bet to win and earned $150,000.</p>
