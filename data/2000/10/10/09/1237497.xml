        <p>His voice, a whisper to begin with, had been scrubbed of every bit of emotion. Barry Bonds, disappointed and drained, tried hard to be gracious last night. He said in many different ways that the Mets deserved to win the game and the series.</p>
        <p>Then, over the hiss of the showers that seem to become amplified in the locker room of a team whose season has just ended, Bonds was asked about his lack of production in the San Francisco Giants' three straight losses to the Mets in the division series.</p>
        <p>Bonds, 1 for 14 in those three games, said he did not want to comment. But he could not help himself. Suddenly, he was talking louder, and he was becoming more animated.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's fair to put it on one person's shoulders,'' Bonds said, meaning his shoulders.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't pressing at all,'' Bonds said, referring to the playoffs. ''That was one of the most comfortable times I've had. A lot of us didn't hit. A lot of us didn't hit. But if you want to blame me, go ahead.''</p>
        <p>The Giants hit .205 in four games against the Mets and managed only one hit last night off Bobby J. Jones in a 4-0 Mets victory. Bonds hit .176 in the series, but he had a lot of company.</p>
        <p>Six of the eight Giants with at least 10 at-bats hit .231 or less.</p>
        <p>''None of us did any good in this series,'' Giants second baseman Jeff Kent said.</p>
        <p>But because Bonds has done things like hit 494 home runs in his career, because he is coming off a most valuable player caliber season in which he hit .306 with 49 home runs, his failures, especially postseason failures, are amplified.</p>
        <p>A day after he went 0 for 5 in a 13-inning loss, Bonds was 0 for 4 yesterday with the Giants facing elimination. He ended four innings with outs. He struck out in his first two at-bats, then flied deep to left field in the fifth and to center field to end the game.</p>
        <p>With fireworks exploding outside the center-field fence, Bonds trotted back to the dugout and almost collided with a television cameraman who had sprinted on the field to capture the Mets hugging each other and jumping around.</p>
        <p>His lack of production in the past week was a mystery to Bonds. He hit .323 against the Mets in 31 at-bats this year. He mentioned that the Giants might have scuffled against Jones because they had not faced him this year, and he also said that it was hard to pick up pitches because the game started late yesterday afternoon. But he did not want to use either factor as an excuse. The Mets, he said, pitched him the way they always do.</p>
        <p>And Jones got on a roll.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't keeping us off balance, and he wasn't tricking us,'' Kent said. ''I just think we were being too aggressive because our backs were against the wall.''</p>
        <p>That aggressiveness led to frustration as dusk rolled in and the shadows went away. Mark Gardner, the losing pitcher, said, ''Guys kept coming back to the dugout saying, 'We're going to get this guy.' It just got harder and harder for us.''</p>
        <p>Dusty Baker, the San Francisco manager, said he kept waiting for one of his players to ''pop one.'' Jones was not surprising any of the Giants with his stuff, but he was getting them to hit the ball at the other eight Mets.</p>
        <p>''It's not like we got completely dominated,'' Baker said.</p>
        <p>Trailing, 4-0, Bonds belted a Jones pitch far into left field. The ball seemed to take a swan dive at its apex and landed in Benny Agbayani's glove around 15 feet from the fence.</p>
        <p>It was one of those days for the Giants, though Bonds clearly did not want to talk about coming close.</p>
        <p>Of that long fly ball, Bonds said, ''That really is irrelevant now, isn't it?''</p>
        <p>The Mets' fans booed him every time he came to the plate, and a fan, in the orange seats right behind third base, waved a sign with an obscene greeting in fluorescent orange paint. It delighted them that the Giants' season ended with Bonds making an out.</p>
        <p>But he will be back. He said that baseball fuels his fire. He said the Giants were ready to play after Saturday's crushing loss, that no one was down, that the music was playing before the game as loudly as it ever has in the locker room.</p>
        <p>''I truly believe that one day God's going to bless me,'' Bonds said.</p>
        <p>The ballplayer blessed with so much talent was talking about winning the World Series for the first time.</p>
        <p>That day has been postponed for at least one more October.</p>
