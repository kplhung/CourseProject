        <p>The Mets are in the League Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves are not. To think that the Yankees came close to being home, too, for the winter. That scenario would have been a trifecta more delicious for the Mets than anything they could have concocted.</p>
        <p>Just a little slip in the bullpen, and George Steinbrenner would have had to face the humility of the Mets playing deeper into October than his team. And then the uniformed members of the Yankees, not to mention the front-office members, would have had to face the owner's wrath. That development would have been worth the price of admission, but now New York area fans can spend their money on tickets for the League Championship Series and maybe the Subway Series, as in World.</p>
        <p>The Mets advanced to the National League Championship Series because Manager Bobby Valentine overcame his one stumble in his planning for the division series and Bobby J. Jones made him look like a genius.</p>
        <p>Valentine was only one of a few managers who would have started Jones in Game 4 of the division series against San Francisco. Sure, the Mets had a two-games-to-one lead and would have had a fresh Mike Hampton to pitch the fifth and deciding game had the Giants knocked Jones all over Shea Stadium. But other managers would not have taken the risk.</p>
        <p>Jones was a far different and more successful pitcher when he returned from a brief visit to the minor leagues in June, but he was still not viewed as comparable to Hampton. Most managers would have opted to go with Hampton on three days' rest instead of the usual four rather than with the risky Jones.</p>
        <p>Just look at the manager in the neighboring borough. Joe Torre could have started the enigmatic Denny Neagle in Game 4 of the Yankees' division series with Oakland -- he is starting him tonight in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series -- but even with a two-games-to-one lead, Torre preferred to use Roger Clemens on three days' rest. Oakland battered Clemens for six runs in five innings and tied the three-of-five-game series.</p>
        <p>Torre opted, too, for a pitcher on three days' rest, Andy Pettitte, for the final game, and Pettitte did not survive the fourth inning, giving up five runs and practically nullifying the Yankees' six-run uprising in the first inning.</p>
        <p>The Yankees clung to their slim lead and survived the series because a series of relievers thwarted the Oakland batters for five and a third innings.</p>
        <p>Valentine, however, disdained the easy choice of starting the star pitcher. Knowing he was leaving himself wide open for an assault by second-guessers, some of his least favorite people, the Mets' manager chose Jones and stuck with Jones.</p>
        <p>Now managers can often make the right moves, whether it's selecting a starting pitcher or bringing in a reliever or putting in a pinch-hitter, and wind up looking bad. As right as a move might be, the players still have to execute to make the manager look good. In a similar way, a manager can make a bad move and look good because the wrong player did the right thing.</p>
        <p>In this instance, Valentine owes Jones a lot, just as Jones owes his manager for showing the confidence to use him. Jones made his manager look maybe even smarter than he thinks he is.</p>
        <p>Continuing a remarkable and wholly unexpected in-season comeback, Jones pitched a one-hitter. Simple as that. Jeff Kent led off the fifth inning with a double, and that was the only hit the Giants got.</p>
        <p>In 30 years of League Championship Series and six years of division series, a total of 377 games, Jones pitched the first complete-game, one-hit shutout, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. Kevin Millwood pitched a one-hitter for the Braves against Houston last season, but he didn't get a shutout because the one hit was a home run by Ken Caminiti.</p>
        <p>Jones joined Don Larsen, who pitched a World Series perfect game 44 years to the date earlier, as two of four pitchers who have pitched a complete-game, postseason shutout with one hit or none. The other two pitchers were Jim Lonborg of Boston in 1967 and Claude Passeau of the Chicago Cubs in 1945.</p>
        <p>As correct as he proved to be in using Jones, Valentine can be questioned for starting Hampton in Game 1. As good as he has been in-season, Hampton has been a postseason failure. Al Leiter, on the other hand, has demonstrated time and again that he is a big-game pitcher. He did it again in the second game against the Giants, limiting them to one run in eight innings.</p>
        <p>Hampton and Leiter are both good pitchers, both good enough to be considered No. 1 in the Mets' rotation. But Leiter has the track record that Hampton is lacking.</p>
        <p>No one can argue with the way the division series turned out for the Mets. For that reason, it's hard to fault Valentine. But the Mets could look even better with Leiter as their leader.</p>
