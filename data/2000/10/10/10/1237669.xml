        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has come under sharp criticism from conservatives in his own party for comments he made on gay marriage during last week's debate with his Democratic rival, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Asked at the debate last Thursday in Danville, Ky., whether homosexuals should have all the constitutional rights enjoyed by other citizens, Mr. Cheney said that ''people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into'' and that the issue of gay marriages should be decided by the states.</p>

        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has come under sharp criticism from conservatives in his own party for comments he made on gay marriage during last week's debate with his Democratic rival, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Asked at the debate last Thursday in Danville, Ky., whether homosexuals should have all the constitutional rights enjoyed by other citizens, Mr. Cheney said that ''people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into'' and that the issue of gay marriages should be decided by the states.</p>
        <p>But the Republican Party platform explicitly opposes gay marriages, saying, ''We support the traditional definition of marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman,'' and going on to pledge that a Republican Justice Department would vigorously defend the Defense of Marriage Act in the courts. That measure, passed by Congress in 1996, denied federal recognition of same-sex marriages.</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop, several conservative groups expressed disappointment with Mr. Cheney for his remarks at the debate.</p>
        <p>''While their views on the state of the military were in sharp contrast, the candidates' views on matrimony were remarkably similar,'' Kenneth L. Connor, the president of the Family Research Council, complained in a message posted last week on his group's Web site.</p>
        <p>''The candidates' comments were, no doubt, heartening to those in the gay community who want to redefine marriage to include homosexual unions. If traditional marriage is the foundation of society, what do last night's comments say about the stability of our foundation?''</p>
        <p>The American Family Association complained on its Web site: ''GOP Veep Candidate Fudges on Social Issues in Debate.''</p>
        <p>''Live and let live is fine as a policy for people's private lives, but Secretary Cheney should have been much stronger in saying that same-sex marriages are wrong,'' Tim Wildmon, the president of the association, said in a statement on the site. ''Secretary Cheney basically said that if a state decided to legalize homosexual marriage -- or polygamy, for that matter -- he thought that was 'appropriate,' as long as it was decided on the state level.''</p>
        <p>During the debate last week, after first saying people should be able to enter any relationship they choose, Mr. Cheney said the issue of government recognition was a much tougher question. ''That's not a slam-dunk,'' he said. ''I think the fact of the matter, of course, is that matter is regulated by the states. I think different states are likely to come to different conclusions, and that's appropriate. I don't think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush has said flatly that he opposes same-sex marriages. And in an interview today aboard his campaign plane, Mr. Cheney said he would defer to his running mate's views on the matter. ''The governor sets the policy for a Bush administration, and I'll be happy to support his policy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney also brushed off the criticism from conservatives. ''Bernie Shaw asked me a question and I answered it truthfully and accurately,'' he said, referring to the moderator of the debate. ''My position's unchanged.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether his response at the debate was informed by his daughter, Mary Cheney, who worked at Coors Brewing Company as a liaison to the gay and lesbian market, he said: ''I have consistently refused to get into the business of talking about Mary. She's entitled to her privacy.''</p>
        <p>While conservatives criticized Mr. Cheney's comments, he won praise from the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights organization based in Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>''Dick Cheney has taken a big step forward by breaking ranks with the extreme right in the GOP by recognizing that gay and lesbian families have a place in America and that these relationships should be respected,'' the group's political director, Winnie Stachelberg, said in a statement the group released today.</p>
