        <p>The conventional wisdom about the twice-a-year fashion collections -- if words like conventional and wisdom can be applied to a process often divorced from both -- is that Paris is where you land to behold the certifiably audacious.</p>
        <p>The thinking goes something like this: if New York is home to the monotonously commercial and Milan functions as the engine of trend, Paris is the place where fashion is distilled to its grand, inscrutable essence, all presumably in the name of art. This is where designers are most likely to consider themselves geniuses, deserving the same rung in the cultural hierarchy as a Renzo Piano, say, or a Nam June Paik. And yet, this is where models are likely to be sent down runways with bamboo inexplicably jutting out of their ears.</p>

        <p>The conventional wisdom about the twice-a-year fashion collections -- if words like conventional and wisdom can be applied to a process often divorced from both -- is that Paris is where you land to behold the certifiably audacious.</p>
        <p>The thinking goes something like this: if New York is home to the monotonously commercial and Milan functions as the engine of trend, Paris is the place where fashion is distilled to its grand, inscrutable essence, all presumably in the name of art. This is where designers are most likely to consider themselves geniuses, deserving the same rung in the cultural hierarchy as a Renzo Piano, say, or a Nam June Paik. And yet, this is where models are likely to be sent down runways with bamboo inexplicably jutting out of their ears.</p>
        <p>The reality of Paris is something a bit different, and as the spring 2001 collections got under way here, that point was made impressively. What distinguishes many designers who show in Paris from those who don't is their willingness to address larger issues of contemporary personal life.</p>
        <p>On the surface, that might sound too earnest, a tad repellent. But by the fourth and final week of the collections, a spectator finds it hard not to crave a little gravitas, especially in a season in which designers have done little beyond churn out drapey, off-the-shoulder jersey numbers that suggest, if anything, that the people who created them have watched VH1's ''Behind the Music'' and probably know the lyrics to more than one Olivia Newton-John song.</p>
        <p>In Paris, so far at any rate, big thoughts (and they are really big only by fashion standards, after all) are finding compelling expression. At Rei Kawakubo's show for Comme des Garcons on Sunday afternoon, models came down the narrow runway with strips of Scotch tape on their faces. Some also wore mountainous crowns made of bubble plastic -- the kind you pack glass with -- or of kraft paper, saran wrap or tinfoil. In a show by almost any other designer, the styling would have seemed ludicrous -- a confirmation of popular suspicions about the inanity of fashion with a capital F.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Kawakubo doesn't traffic in gimmicks; in recent seasons she has been conducting a dialogue with herself about the ways women should and should not subvert the femininity society demands of them. Women are sent out into the world as packages to be looked over or overlooked, Ms. Kawakubo was quite literally saying. It's an idea as old as Jane Austen, but rarely is it executed so forcefully in fashion.</p>
        <p>In her fall 1999 collection, and even more powerfully in her spring 2000 line, Ms. Kawakubo exploited cliches of femininity -- blowing up bows on dresses to gigantic proportions and affixing flowers that looked like crepe paper to pastel jackets and sweaters. Her next collection, rooted in punk, seemed to be casting a vote for a more aggressive, masculine form of self-presentation.</p>
        <p>Of course, women, Hillary Clinton being the most public example, go back and forth on how to be. The greatest virtue of Ms. Kawakubo's show was her apparent acceptance of the fact that at the moment this conflict cannot necessarily be resolved. To this end, too, Ms. Kawakubo's references were literal, but at the same time everything she produced looked original. A strip of camouflage duct tape was a part of almost all of her looks, including a girlishly printed cap-sleeve dress and a reconstructed pinstripe skirt suit. A jacket in a camouflage print might seem militant and at the same time look almost as if it could appear on the cover of a bodice-ripper because of the ruching at the breast.</p>
        <p>On the first official day of the Paris shows, a certain exuberance took hold among the fashion crowd, a kind that led editors to file out of the Comme des Garcons show proclaiming the clothes beautiful when most of them were not because that wasn't the point. But the day had gotten off to a mood-lifting start with Junya Watanabe's show that morning.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Kawakubo, Mr. Watanabe is fascinated by the ways femininity is defined. Last season he put women in what can only be described as birthday cakes of tulle, exquisite in their architecture. This season, he turned to simple lines and approached the idea of woman as confection more ironically. He printed layered shirts and short dresses with photographs of dessert: a berry tart, a strawberry-chocolate cake. Another series of striped dresses and shirts were trimmed with pearls. Sometimes they were studded neatly at the neckline, and some were twisted so the back became a strangled, beautifully articulated mess.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because Yohji Yamamoto once appeared in a fairly pretentious Wim Wenders documentary about himself, it is easy to think of him as work. In fact, going to his shows is a lot like reading certain Wallace Stevens poems: you don't really get his point at first (or ever), but the fragmented beauty of his language leads you to keep trying.</p>
        <p>This season, however, it seems quite clear what Mr. Yamamoto is trying to say. When a model is sent down the runway in a perfectly cut flowing pantsuit with a halter top made to look like a giant change purse, it does not take the critical skills of a Roland Barthes to see that Mr. Yamamoto has something to say about the ways we define ourselves by what we acquire. He is also playing with ideas about the warring masculine and feminine sides of women, placing a sheer train on a pantsuit that was half pinstriped and half solid-colored fabric. He kept returning, though, to the theme of the purse, joining a model's wrist, for example, to a drawstring sack that grew seamlessly from the side of a dress and left one almost mesmerized.</p>
        <p>It fell to the Dutch team of Viktor &amp; Rolf to lighten things up, and ever so cleverly. For the most part, the designers showed wide-leg three-piece suits, some of pique, which they paired with ties. But they knew better than to show them on a runway where simplicity is not always welcome. They poked fun at the fashion crowd's need for entertainment, presenting the clothes on tap dancers they discovered at an Amsterdam dance school. The designers took lessons themselves, and tapped their way through the finale.</p>
        <p>The French houses that showed on Sunday betwixt the Japanese and the Dutch brought little to the provocative party. Christian Lacroix's show at the Louvre was certainly an improvement over last season's circus-theme affair. But his gaudy patchwork hip belts paired with chiffon dresses and multicolored jersey skirts added up to nothing.</p>
        <p>Martin Margiela's show for Hermes seemed hijacked from the creators of the Land's End catalog. There were loose cotton T-shirts, soft buttonless jackets and what looked like maternity pants on women who did not appear pregnant.</p>
        <p>As Jeremy Scott put it a few seasons ago, ''Vive l'avant-garde.''</p>
