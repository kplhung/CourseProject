        <p>An art gallery in SoHo has opened an exhibition of graffiti-inspired work, which the gallery owner says is an example of a ''great New York vernacular art form.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>An art gallery in SoHo has opened an exhibition of graffiti-inspired work, which the gallery owner says is an example of a ''great New York vernacular art form.''</p>
        <p>''It's an amazing innovation that came directly off the streets of New York,'' said Jeffrey Deitch, owner of the Deitch Projects gallery, on Wooster Street in SoHo.</p>
        <p>But the Police Department, which considers the spray-painting of other people's property a crime and not art, used the exhibition as an opportunity to arrest one of the artists in the show, Todd James, for graffiti he once spray-painted on the streets of New York. His work, large Pop Art pieces mimicking contemporary advertising, helped make his name in the art world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deitch said the show, ''Street Market,'' which opened Thursday, is meant to reorder the aesthetics of the outside world indoors. It fills the Deitch Projects gallery space with a variety of elements. Two big trucks lie overturned on the floor on the left side of the deep gallery, and to the right there is a row of storefronts that appear to be fully operational. Inside each store, the artists have created faux products, like cans of ''Street Cred'' -- short for ''street credibility'' -- and bottles of ''Guilt.''</p>
        <p>From the tops of the stores to the gallery's high rafters, there are towers of large, colorful metal billboards, but instead of advertising real products, they sell ''Objects of Glamour'' and ''Hand-made Myth.''</p>
        <p>On Oct. 2, Mr. James, one of the three artists, was arrested by a police vandals unit across the street from the gallery as he was preparing for the opening of the show. Two days later, the vandals unit arrested Josh Lazcano, who was helping another artist featured in the show, Barry McGee, install his pieces. Mr. McGee, who uses the tag Twist, was not arrested. The third artist in the show, Stephen J. Powers, is currently facing criminal charges in two state graffiti-related cases.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. James nor Mr. Lazcano would speak to a reporter about the arrests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deitch said he was stunned by the police action. ''This is unprecedented,'' Mr. Deitch said. ''I have never, never in my experience known artists to be arrested while they're putting up a serious museum exhibition in a leading gallery.'' (A smaller version of the exhibition appeared at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia in May.)</p>
        <p>But the police said the two men were arrested because of their earlier activities in spray-painting graffiti, not in connection with any work in the ''Street Market'' show.</p>
        <p>''These individuals have been long known to the Police Department, and they have a history of damaging property,'' said June Martucci, a police spokeswoman. ''It has nothing to do with the show.''</p>
        <p>According to police complaints filed in court, Mr. James, 29, was charged with three graffiti-related misdemeanors in the defacing of Middle School 143 in the Bronx in November 1999, where his tag, REAS, was spray-painted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazcano, 25, was charged with one felony count of criminal mischief in the second degree in the spray-painting of a building at 91 East Broadway in 1997, with his tag, Amaze.</p>
        <p>Last year, the police arrested Mr. Powers at his home in SoHo and seized materials from his apartment. They confiscated pictures of Mr. Lazcano and Mr. James, which were used as evidence to make arrests last week, according to police reports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers's lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby, said the recent arrests were an attempt to intimidate Mr. Powers.</p>
        <p>''It's a form of harassment,'' Mr. Kuby said. ''To the extent that the  vandal squad have open complaints on individuals, all they have to do is contact me and we'll arrange for them to appear in court. Instead they go to an art exhibit so they can act like snipers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers, whose tag, ESPO, stands for ''exterior surface painting operation,'' has been painting metal grates and walls with his moniker for several years, and he is the author of a book about the history of graffiti, ''The Art of Getting Over'' (St. Martin's Press, 1999).</p>
        <p>In March, Mr. Powers was indicted in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on four graffiti-related felony charges, and in April he was indicted in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on two charges. Each charge carries a prison term of up to four years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers, 32, said he has put his days of street art behind him. Now, his work sells for $2,500 to $20,000 at Deitch Projects.</p>
        <p>''I'm fighting the case they have against me in court, and this is how they're responding,'' Mr. Powers said at the opening of ''Street Market.'' ''It's intense because I can withstand any form of bureaucracy or jail or whatever they want to throw at me because I'm doing something much more powerful here in this gallery. But now it's like I'm finally leaving school and the bullies just want to get their last kicks in.''</p>
