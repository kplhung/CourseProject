        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Kentucky Derby and a leading candidate for Horse of the Year, sustained a minor cut on his left front hoof and was withdrawn yesterday from the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup on Saturday at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>The race is the foremost prep for the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov.4, but it will no longer feature a showdown between Fusaichi Pegasus and Lemon Drop Kid, his chief rival for the title. And although Pegasus is still scheduled to run in the Classic against Lemon Drop Kid and other star horses, that race now looms as the last for the regal colt, who was sold for $4 million as a yearling and was then valued at $60 million for stallion duty next year.</p>

        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Kentucky Derby and a leading candidate for Horse of the Year, sustained a minor cut on his left front hoof and was withdrawn yesterday from the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup on Saturday at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>The race is the foremost prep for the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov.4, but it will no longer feature a showdown between Fusaichi Pegasus and Lemon Drop Kid, his chief rival for the title. And although Pegasus is still scheduled to run in the Classic against Lemon Drop Kid and other star horses, that race now looms as the last for the regal colt, who was sold for $4 million as a yearling and was then valued at $60 million for stallion duty next year.</p>
        <p>Pegasus probably kicked himself in the front hoof during some leisurely playtime on Friday, said Neil Drysdale, who trains him for Japanese owners.</p>
        <p>''We galloped him yesterday, and there was a speck of blood,'' Drysdale said yesterday after canceling a workout. ''He will skip the race. Better safe than sorry.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale said that the Jockey Club Gold Cup had always been considered a bonus for his horse, who would now be trained up to the Breeders' Cup by workouts. After winning the Derby in May and running second to Red Bullet in the Preakness two weeks later, Pegasus was withdrawn from the Belmont Stakes in June after sustaining a minor injury to his right front hoof in his stall. He spent the summer on the sideline, but made a powerful comeback to win the Jerome Handicap on Sept. 23.</p>
        <p>''We ran in the Jerome to give us plenty of time in case of a minor setback,'' Drysdale said. ''This is all within the realm of the plan and why we started early. In the scheme of things, it's not too bad. We'll give him two or three days off, and ship to Kentucky on the 16th, as scheduled.''</p>
        <p>One immediate result of the withdrawal was to encourage Skimming, winner of the Pacific Classic, to enter the Gold Cup with Kent Desormeaux riding in place of Garrett Gomez. Usually, Desormeaux is the jockey on Pegasus. Bobby Frankel, who trains Skimming, had planned to run Skimming in the Meadowlands Cup last Saturday but withdrew him after the colt was assigned high weight.</p>
        <p>Albert the Great, who will be one of the favorites in the Gold Cup, worked five furlongs in 584/5  seconds and galloped out six furlongs in 1:112/5  yesterday. His trainer, Nick Zito, said he was pleased but added, ''I didn't think he'd go that fast.''</p>
        <p>Zito said he did not want to see Albert the Great make the same mistake that he did in the Jerome: setting a fast pace for half a mile but then tiring in the homestretch to finish third.</p>
        <p>''He ran good in the Jerome, but I wasn't pleased,'' Zito said. ''I wanted him to take back and make a run, just like Fusaichi Pegasus did.''</p>
        <p>The Gold Cup, which will be run at a mile and a quarter, will also include Gander, Behrens and Agol Lack.</p>
        <p>The favorite, now that Fusaichi Pegasus has been withdrawn, will be Lemon Drop Kid, the 4-year-old who has reeled off consecutive scores in the Brooklyn, the Suburban, the Whitney and the Woodward.</p>
        <p>The Gold Cup will be the main event of a Breeders' Cup preview that will also feature the $500,000 Frizette for 2-year-old fillies, the $250,000 Forest Hills Handicap for 3-year-olds and up, the $750,000 Beldame for fillies and mares and the $500,000 Champagne for 2-year-olds.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>In the $75,000 Pebbles Handicap for 3-year-old fillies yesterday, Lady Dora, a 12-1 long shot, made a furious rush deep in the homestretch to defeat De Aar by half a length, with the favored Tippity Witch another length back in third. It was the fourth victory for Lady Dora in her last six starts. She ran the mile and an eighth on the inner turf course in 1:483/5 , and returned $27 for a $2 bet to win. Her trainer, MICHAEL MATZ, who switched her from dirt to grass racing this season, said, ''When we were in Florida, I worked her on the turf and she seemed to like it, so it seemed to be something we would try.'' And JOHN VELAZQUEZ, who rode Lady Dora for the first time, reported how the filly had shot from ninth place in the 11-horse field into the lead: ''I knew that she would be coming from off the pace. She just exploded from the five-sixteenths pole.''</p>
