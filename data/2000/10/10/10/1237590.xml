        <p>The Vodafone Group is in talks with Eircom, Ireland's telecommunications conglomerate, about taking a majority stake in or buying all of Eircell, its mobile subsidiary, people close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>A bid for all of Eircell would probably be valued at 5 billion euros, or about $4.3 billion, these people said --  more than 80 percent of the market value of the entire parent company.

        <p>The Vodafone Group is in talks with Eircom, Ireland's telecommunications conglomerate, about taking a majority stake in or buying all of Eircell, its mobile subsidiary, people close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>A bid for all of Eircell would probably be valued at 5 billion euros, or about $4.3 billion, these people said --  more than 80 percent of the market value of the entire parent company.  Discussions with Vodafone, which began in September, are likely to be completed within the next month, a person close to Eircom said.</p>
        <p>For Vodafone, buying Eircell, which had one million subscribers as of June and a market penetration of 58 percent, would fit its strategy of  acquiring mobile operations in areas where it is not currently represented.</p>
        <p>Last week, Vodafone, the world's biggest mobile phone company, said that it would invest $2.5 billion and strike an alliance with China's largest wireless phone company, China Mobile Hong Kong Ltd. In the United States, Vodafone is a partner in Verizon Wireless with Verizon Communications, formerly Bell Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Although Ireland is a relatively small market, with less than one-tenth the population of Britain, it is strategically important for Vodafone. A deal would allow the company to offer lower roaming charges for customers who travel between the two countries. It would also allow Vodafone to match its British rival, British Telecommunications, which entered the Irish mobile market in January with a $2.5 billion purchase of Esat, the country's No. 2 player behind Eircell.</p>
        <p>Eircom posted a statement on its Web site this morning confirming that it was in talks that ''may or may not lead to the disposal of part or all of Eircell.''</p>
        <p>The company declined to elaborate. Vodafone also declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Many large telecommunications companies are facing capital constraints as costs related to new services escalate while funds for such services tighten. Vodafone, however,  has the ability to continue making deals, analysts said, even after absorbing Mannesmann of Germany this year in a $183 billion acquisition, the largest takeover ever.</p>
        <p>''Vodafone is in a strong position in regard to the strength of its balance sheet at a time when many telecom companies have stretched balance sheets,'' said Douglas Wight, an analyst with Commerzbank in London. ''It makes sense for them to continue making acquisitions that fill in with their broader strategy.''</p>
        <p>Eircom, for its part, has been looking to revamp its business in an increasingly difficult regulatory and competitive environment. More than 60 telecommunications companies -- including WorldCom, the cable television operator NTL and Esat -- have begun operating in Ireland since Eircom lost its state-sponsored monopoly almost two years ago.</p>
        <p>Irish and European Union rules force Eircom to lease capacity on its local network to such competitors. Recent attempts to focus its core business on Internet and data services have suffered from persistent delays in a planned high-speed D.S.L. service.</p>
        <p>Eircom went public in July 1999.</p>
