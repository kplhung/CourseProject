        <p>The one and only Rickey Henderson returned to New York yesterday to prepare for another playoff game. It was hard to miss him. He wore a hooded sweatshirt under his blue jacket, stood next to the batting cage and razzed his teammates loudly.</p>
        <p>Henderson, who turns 42 on Christmas Day, is the type of player who still attracts a lot of attention. He is the leadoff hitter for the Seattle Mariners now, and he predicted that when he stepped in the batter's box against Denny Neagle at the start of Game 1 of the American League Championship Series tonight, the fans at Yankee Stadium would greet him raucously. He likes it that way.</p>
        <p>''It's fun to me,'' he said. ''A lot of times, it's nice that they acknowledge you. They know who you are.''</p>
        <p>It is not possible to be a baseball fan from New York and not know who Rickey Henderson is. He played for the Yankees from 1985 to 1989. He played for the Mets last year and part of this year.</p>
        <p>His stay with the Mets ended with his release on May 13 and was more than a little turbulent. Henderson said he had tried to move on and to forget about it. He said, for example, that he liked playing for Mariners Manager Lou Piniella much more than he liked playing for the Mets' Bobby Valentine. ''Lou just lets you play,'' Henderson said.</p>
        <p>Henderson was not sure how many big-league games Valentine had played in, but he said Piniella had a better feel as to how to handle his players.</p>
        <p>''Bobby wanted to control it more than anything,'' Henderson said.</p>
        <p>Henderson was off and running. He said he voted against the Mets' opening the season in Japan, because he had been to Japan five times and knew how a trip there could drain a player. He said the reports that he and Bobby Bonilla played cards during Game 6 of the National League Championship Series last season were erroneous. He and Bonilla played cards before a lot of games, he said, but not during games.</p>
        <p>''To me,'' he said, ''it was just a bunk story.''</p>
        <p>Then there was the episode that led to his departure. In a May 12 game against Florida, Henderson smacked a long fly ball that he thought was a home run. But the ball bounced off the wall, and Henderson, who had gone into his home run trot, was held to a single. He thought a fan had thrown the ball back on the field.</p>
        <p>''Any time I hit a ball and I go to first base that way,'' he said, ''99 percent of the time, it's out of here.''</p>
        <p>This one stayed in the park. Henderson was released the next day. He signed with Seattle eight hours after he cleared waivers. He has found a niche getting on base and making things happen with the Mariners, and he says he is happy. ''People can go out and talk what they want to talk about,'' he said. ''I just want to go out and play baseball.''</p>
        <p>When the Mariners moved into roomy Safeco Field last summer and then dealt Ken Griffey Jr., Piniella realized he needed to change the team's makeup and playing style. Pitching, base running and defense became more important.</p>
        <p>''This is the first year he's really had the opportunity to manage,'' Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez said of Piniella.</p>
        <p>Piniella does not care for the term ''little ball,'' but he said the Mariners needed to play better situational baseball. Henderson, who played for Piniella when he managed the Yankees, was a perfect fit, in many ways.</p>
        <p>''He gave us the swagger we needed,'' Piniella said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Henderson went to the plate six times in the Mariners' three-game sweep of the Chicago White Sox in their division series. He got on base three times. Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez are the Mariners' best offensive players, but they are not the only weapons.</p>
        <p>''Usually, you tell yourself there's one guy you don't want to let beat you,'' Neagle said. ''In this lineup, there are a couple of them. You want to try to keep the table setters off the base paths, especially Henderson.''</p>
        <p>Martinez and Rodriguez combined to drive in 277 runs, the most in the majors by two players on the same team. The Mariners were 51-37 in games in which Henderson led off. The Mariners broke a team record by drawing 775 walks and, consequently, broke another team record by winning 91 regular-season games.</p>
        <p>Now, Henderson and the Mets have a chance to get to the World Series, but not with each other. Henderson did not see anything odd about how things worked out. He said he was not angry with the Mets.</p>
        <p>''I've always been a scapegoat,'' he said, shrugging.</p>
        <p>''Whether I'm at the top or at the bottom, everybody wants to read about Rickey.''</p>
