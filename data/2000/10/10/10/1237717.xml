        <p>Shares of EM.TV and Merchandising, the German media company that bought the Jim Henson Company as well as a 50 percent stake in the Formula One racing organization earlier this year, plunged 32 percent after the company said it had overstated earnings. The sell-off reduced the company's market value by more than $1 billion, and was aggravated by the rout of many European technology and media companies. EM.TV, based outside Munich, had been one of Germany's most spectacular stock market performers, climbing 31,000 percent between the time it went public in 1997 and its peak last February. The company said first-half profits at Henson, which produces the Muppets television shows and movies, had been overstated by about $16 million.</p>
