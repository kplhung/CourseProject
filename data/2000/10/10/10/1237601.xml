        <p>''I broke my G-string!'' someone bellowed on the darkened stage Monday at Irving Plaza. Merle Haggard was 30 minutes late, and the crowd was fidgeting. Was the Clyde Barrow of country music, the smoothest outlaw ever to sing honeyed words into a microphone, going to pull off this latest caper, promoting a new album on a punk label to an audience of relatively youthful downtowners?</p>
        <p>You betcha. When Mr. Haggard finally sauntered out, wearing Nikes instead of cowboy boots and a sort of track suit that looked borrowed from his Bakersfield neighbors in Korn, he didn't even have to speak to win the crowd. He simply began ''Silver Wings,'' a song that presaged his current signing to Epitaph when the roots-punk band the Knitters recorded it in 1985. The 10 members of this band, the Strangers, glided into the tale of airport abandonment. Mr. Haggard fussed with his guitar, but didn't miss a mournful phrase as he sang into a vintage microphone.</p>

        <p>''I broke my G-string!'' someone bellowed on the darkened stage Monday at Irving Plaza. Merle Haggard was 30 minutes late, and the crowd was fidgeting. Was the Clyde Barrow of country music, the smoothest outlaw ever to sing honeyed words into a microphone, going to pull off this latest caper, promoting a new album on a punk label to an audience of relatively youthful downtowners?</p>
        <p>You betcha. When Mr. Haggard finally sauntered out, wearing Nikes instead of cowboy boots and a sort of track suit that looked borrowed from his Bakersfield neighbors in Korn, he didn't even have to speak to win the crowd. He simply began ''Silver Wings,'' a song that presaged his current signing to Epitaph when the roots-punk band the Knitters recorded it in 1985. The 10 members of this band, the Strangers, glided into the tale of airport abandonment. Mr. Haggard fussed with his guitar, but didn't miss a mournful phrase as he sang into a vintage microphone.</p>
        <p>His fans riotously hooted as he moved through a set list that must be embedded in his DNA by now. ''Mama Tried,'' ''Big City,'' ''Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down'': these are the foundational texts of hard country, not only great tunes but defining components of the music's populist image. While his youngers in Nashville make music for yuppies to play in their SUV's, the 63-year-old Mr. Haggard has stayed at least symbolically working-class: this tour, in fact, was sponsored by Labor Finders, a temporary staffing service for commercial, industrial and construction workers.</p>
        <p>His knack for mythologizing the working guy connects Mr. Haggard to American punk. Bands like Bad Religion, whose former guitarist founded Epitaph, the label releasing Mr. Haggard's new album, ''I Wish I Could Fly,'' walks the same hardscrabble territory Mr. Haggard claims. The hip young fans in Monday's audience shouted along with ''Okie From Muskogee,'' his anti-hippie anthem, forgiving their hero his conservatism in light of his populist authenticity.</p>
        <p>In reality, of course, Mr. Haggard and his band are total sophisticates, versed in western swing, blues and bluegrass, and on Monday they breezily proved that country can be utterly elegant. Trading solos as Mr. Haggard directed, the guitarists Red Volkaert, Freddy Powers and Norm Hamlet (on lap and pedal steel) added crafty detail to the familiar songs. With so many virtuosos onstage -- there were also two back-up singers, a horn player, a keyboardist, a fiddler and a rhythm section -- the sound could have easily degenerated into a pile-up. But everyone kept in his lane, guided by Mr. Haggard's impeccable vocal interplay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haggard's nonchalance lent spontaneity to a set he has undoubtedly been performing for years. He didn't feature many songs from his new album, although he did sing its haunting title track, a Blaze Foley song he first recorded with Willie Nelson in 1987. The Strangers also sank their teeth into standards by Bob Wills and Lefty Frizzell and a merry version of ''Milk Cow Blues.''</p>
        <p>The Bonnie to Mr. Haggard's Clyde, his ex-wife (the third of five spouses) and ongoing back-up singer Bonnie Owens, came up front for a  duet on the fitting ''Faded Love.'' Mr. Haggard appeared slightly flustered during that song, nearly walloping Ms. Owens by accident when he signaled Mr. Hamlet to solo. Surely, though, his abashment was only an act. In love and music Mr. Haggard's happy to have seen it all.</p>
        <p>POP REVIEW  Correction:  October 16, 2000, Monday  A pop review on Tuesday about the country singer Merle Haggard misstated the day of his appearance at Irving Plaza. It was Oct. 8, not last Monday. The review also misstated the title of his new album and its lead song. It is ''If I Could Only Fly,'' by Blaze Foley, not ''I Wish I Could Fly.''</p>
