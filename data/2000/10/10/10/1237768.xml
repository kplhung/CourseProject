        <p>NICHOLAS-Carl, 88, long-timeNew York City resident and fixture of the Broadway Stage, died peacefully at Encore Senior Village in Tucson, AZ October 7, 2000. Mr. Nicholas born in Appleton, WI in 1912, graduated from Lawrence University in 1935, then came to New York to further his vocal studies at The Juilliard School. His first appearance on Broadway was in Knickerbocker Holiday (1939), followed by roles in DuBarry Was A Lady (1939) and Lady in The Dark (1940). With the advent of World War II, Mr. Nicholas joined the cast of Irving Berlin's This Is The Army, touring the world and entertaining U.S. troops overseas for the duration. With his reentry to civilian life, he returned to the theater, and began an unprecedented string of Broadway performances in, among other shows, Guys And Dolls (1950), Music Man (1957), Mr. President (1962), Walking Happy (1966), Jimmy (1969) and, ultimately, My One and Only (1983) with Tommy Tune and Twiggy. Mr. Nicholas is survived by his brother Robert, of Tucson, nephews David (Paula), of Fairview, NC, and Richard (Gale), of Suisun City, CA, and dear and caring friends.</p>
