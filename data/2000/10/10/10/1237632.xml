        <p>Letter from Federal Communications Commisioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth says networks and stations are fully within their legal rights in refusing to televise presidential debates; says having more channels carrying same debate serves no one's needs, and only the American people should decide whether debates are worth watching (Oct 3 Op-Ed)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is difficult to accept the apparent contention of William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, that only by carrying presidential debates would networks ''serve the needs of citizens by facilitating an informed democratic process'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 3). All but a handful of Americans had multiple choices of outlets carrying the first debate. To add one or more additional channels carrying the same debate serves no one's needs.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is difficult to accept the apparent contention of William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, that only by carrying presidential debates would networks ''serve the needs of citizens by facilitating an informed democratic process'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 3). All but a handful of Americans had multiple choices of outlets carrying the first debate. To add one or more additional channels carrying the same debate serves no one's needs.</p>
        <p>The article also does not mention a fundamental point: networks and stations were acting fully within their legal rights. The F.C.C. should stop the age-old tactic of publicly criticizing law-abiding stations in order to bring about a policy goal that has no basis in law.</p>
        <p>This election season, there will be many important debates -- but only the American people should decide whether they are worth watching.</p>
        <p>HAROLD FURCHTGOTT-ROTH  Commissioner, Federal  Communications Commission  Washington, Oct. 5, 2000</p>
