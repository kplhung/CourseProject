      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial sees debate audiences trying to gauge whether candidate has presidential temperament, not just intelligence and mastery of facts; holds Vice Pres Al Gore's concept of debates as 'like job interview' is too limited and even politically dangerous for him; holds outcome of his next debate with Gov George W Bush could be decided by some symbolic moment that inspires swing voters to leap of faith</p>

        <p>In the current New Yorker, the magazine's Washington correspondent, Joe Klein, recounts an exchange from a 1992 campaign debate in which President Bush gave a fumbling answer to a question from the audience about how the national debt affected the ''economic problems of common people.'' Because the woman who asked the question was black, Mr. Bush noted that he had been to an A.M.E. church recently. Then he veered awkwardly to the subject of teenage pregnancies. When Bill Clinton's turn came, he stepped toward the woman and said, ''Tell me how it's affected you again.'' In Mr. Klein's view, this demonstration of Mr. Clinton's superior empathic ability was a pivotal moment in their competition. The observation touches on the perennial questions of what voters look for in the candidate debates and how they process what they see and hear.</p>
        <p>In our view, the history of televised debates since John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon met in 1960 demonstrates that mastery of facts is seldom decisive. Kennedy exaggerated the ''missile gap,'' and many contemporary observers famously thought that Nixon had won. In 1980, Jimmy Carter outpointed Ronald Reagan on substance. Last week Vice President Al Gore demonstrated a superior grasp of every aspect of domestic and foreign policy, but his presentation apparently set the stage for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to leap past him in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.</p>

        <p>In the current New Yorker, the magazine's Washington correspondent, Joe Klein, recounts an exchange from a 1992 campaign debate in which President Bush gave a fumbling answer to a question from the audience about how the national debt affected the ''economic problems of common people.'' Because the woman who asked the question was black, Mr. Bush noted that he had been to an A.M.E. church recently. Then he veered awkwardly to the subject of teenage pregnancies.

        <p>In our view, the history of televised debates since John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon met in 1960 demonstrates that mastery of facts is seldom decisive. Kennedy exaggerated the ''missile gap,'' and many contemporary observers famously thought that Nixon had won. In 1980, Jimmy Carter outpointed Ronald Reagan on substance. Last week Vice President Al Gore demonstrated a superior grasp of every aspect of domestic and foreign policy, but his presentation apparently set the stage for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to leap past him in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.</p>
        <p>The point, we hope, is not that intelligence does not matter, but rather that voters are not looking only for the smarter contestant or the more articulate or the more experienced, as the elder Mr. Bush was in 1992. The act of political bonding that must take place between a candidate and the voters is more complex than that. A certain level of intelligence is required as table stakes, so to speak. But the examples of Mr. Reagan and -- so far -- Governor Bush show that the public cannot be spooked by jokes and commentary to the effect that a given nominee may not be the brightest bulb on the tree.</p>
        <p>The explanation may be that people are looking for something that cannot be strictly measured by I.Q. or by checking a resume for the number of years in Washington. Debate audiences are trying to gauge something more mysterious and unpredictable, which is whether a given individual has a presidential temperament. Nostalgia for past presidents probably plays a role, too, as time exaggerates their virtues and blurs the defects. Who wouldn't like a candidate who combined J.F.K.'s charm, Mr. Reagan's optimism and Mr. Clinton's empathy?</p>
        <p>The importance of such unquantifiable qualities probably means that Mr. Gore's concept of the debates as ''like a job interview'' is too limited and even politically dangerous for Mr. Gore, given his passion to explain his qualifications over and over. A more expansive metaphor has been used by campaign strategists who say that in political broadcasts the television camera works like an X-ray, exposing all aspects of a candidate's personality, character, intellect and inner commitments.</p>
        <p>But no conceptual model fully covers the odd drama that will have its second act when Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have their next meeting tomorrow night. The vice president believes that the voters will succumb to a relentless reading of the facts on his inner teleprompter. The Texas governor thinks he can charm them into overlooking the manifest gaps in his knowledge and experience. In the end, the outcome could well be decided by some symbolic moment that inspires swing voters to a leap of faith.</p>
