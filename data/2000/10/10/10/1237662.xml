        <p>The Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance Company, one of Japan's largest insurers, filed for bankruptcy protection today after the government unsuccessfully sought to force other financial institutions to throw it a lifeline. Chiyoda's failure, with nearly $27 billion in liabilities, made it Japan's biggest postwar bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>The company has long been known as perhaps the most financially unsound of Japan's generally unsound life insurers, having failed to attract a foreign investor or Japanese bank for help, so its downfall came as little surprise. But like the collapse of the Sogo department store company nearly three months ago, the Chiyoda bankruptcy was a reminder of the enormous corporate debts that still infect the Japanese financial system.</p>
        <p>Chiyoda had debts totaling 2.94 trillion yen, or $26.95 billion at current exchange rates, surpassing the record bankruptcy two years ago of the Japan Leasing Corporation, which had debts totaling 2.4 trillion yen. Sogo's debts totaled 1.87 trillion yen.</p>
        <p>The problems at Chiyoda represent an extreme version of the broader trouble confronting most of Japan's life insurance companies, which are paying out an average of 4 percent on insurance policies sold a decade ago, when interest rates were far higher. With interest rates now at less than 1 percent, their return on assets is far lower than their obligations.</p>
        <p>Chiyoda took advantage of new laws that permit financial companies to reorganize under court protection. Its president, Reiji Yoneyama, said today that the American International Group Inc., an insurance company based in the United States, has expressed interest in joining forces to reconstruct the company.</p>
        <p>Chiyoda had had discussions with foreign companies that included Allianz of Germany. Those talks broke off last week.</p>
        <p>Chiyoda, founded 96 years ago, is Japan's 12th-largest life insurer, with more than 400 branches and 13,000 employees. It is not a publicly traded company because it is owned by policyholders.</p>
        <p>It is unclear what impact, if any, the bankruptcy would have on Japan's financial markets, which were closed today for a holiday.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most surprising outcome of the Chiyoda bankruptcy was the failure of ''convoy capitalism,'' a system of good companies rescuing bad at the behest of politicians and bureaucrats, a hallmark of the Japanese economy since the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>Just a day before the bankruptcy filing, Hideyuki Aizawa, head of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency in charge of overhauling Japan's financial system, said the government had asked financial institutions with a relationship to Chiyoda Life to help bail it out.</p>
        <p>''If Chiyoda Life should collapse, it will be the failure of a very large life assurer, which will affect policyholders, lenders and employees,'' Mr. Aizawa said. ''As far as possible, we want to avoid bankruptcy and ensure its survival.''</p>
        <p>He indicated that Tokai Bank, one of the largest shareholders of Chiyoda, would be a likely source of assistance.</p>
        <p>Chiyoda Life had asked Tokai for 300 billion yen, or $2.75 billion, but Tokai avoided coming to the rescue, saying it was in the middle of preparaing for its merger with Sanwa Bank and Toyo Trust Holdings.</p>
        <p>Then, last week, when the three banks signed their merger agreement, Hideo Ogasawara, the president of Tokai, said Chiyoda Life would have to find an ally, possibly a foreigner, and drastically change its business model before Tokai would make any further investment in it.</p>
        <p>That is tough talk from a Japanese bank president. It suggested a growing independence among Japanese financial institutions, which have long been obedient to the wishes of powerful bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance.</p>
        <p>But banks and other financial institutions are now overseen by a new set of regulators. And the rules of the game seem to be slowly changing, albeit in a ''two steps forward, one step back'' pattern.</p>
