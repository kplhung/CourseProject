        <p>Agleam Again</p>
        <p>In the open steppes of southern Russia outside the village of Filippovka, from 1986 to 1990, archaeologists recovered a cache of early nomadic Eurasian art. Dating from the fifth to fourth century B.C., these hundreds of ornately carved objects decorated in gold were characterized by animal imagery, particularly the deer. Beginning on Thursday, some 200 of these works, none previously on public view, will be seen through Feb. 4 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes,'' its centerpiece 16 wooden stags, some nearly two feet high and covered with gold and silver, is complemented by 100 related objects from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>

        <p>Agleam Again</p>
        <p>In the open steppes of southern Russia outside the village of Filippovka, from 1986 to 1990, archaeologists recovered a cache of early nomadic Eurasian art. Dating from the fifth to fourth century B.C., these hundreds of ornately carved objects decorated in gold were characterized by animal imagery, particularly the deer. Beginning on Thursday, some 200 of these works, none previously on public view, will be seen through Feb. 4 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes,'' its centerpiece 16 wooden stags, some nearly two feet high and covered with gold and silver, is complemented by 100 related objects from the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
        <p>Time Remembered</p>
        <p>The title is ''Whispers From the Walls.'' Visible tomorrow through Jan. 7 at the Studio Museum in Harlem, at 144 West 125th Street, it is a mixed-media installation by Whitfield Lovell that employs layered voices, artifacts, portraits and sounds to evoke an act of bigotry some 80 years ago in Texas. At that time, a thriving black community was forced to move because of fears aroused by its proximity to a white women's college in Denton. Organized by the University of North Texas Art Gallery, ''Whitfield Lovell, Whispers From the Walls'' is constructed around a fully furnished one-room cabin perched on a mound of earth. Inside and outside, drawings, photos, other objects and music turn the onlooker into intruder and witness.</p>
        <p>In Honor</p>
        <p>On Oct. 14, 1990, Leonard Bernstein died. Throughout this month, with concerts and special events, the New York Philharmonic will honor the memory of the man who was its music director from 1958 to 1969 and held the title laureate conductor at his death at 72. On Thursday evening at 8 Leonard Slatkin as guest conductor is to lead the Philharmonic in the first of four performances through Oct. 17 featuring Bernstein's Symphony No. 1, ''Jeremiah,'' on a program that includes works by Dvorak and Mendelssohn. On Thursday the Philharmonic will also release ''Bernstein Live,'' a 10-CD set of 33 previously unissued Bernstein performances with the orchestra.</p>
        <p>Back to Birdland</p>
        <p>The man who wrote ''Lullaby of Birdland'' in 1952 is returning to Birdland after 40 years. The club may not be in its old location at 1678 Broadway, near 52nd Street, but the jazz pianist George Shearing's quintet will be playing tonight through Saturday at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, in an engagement to be recorded live by Telarc.</p>
