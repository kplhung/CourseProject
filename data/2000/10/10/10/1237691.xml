        <p>Israel Extends Ultimatum, As Cabinet Weighs Options  Prime Minister Ehud Barak's deadline for the Palestinians to end violent protests expired with riots still raging, but the Israeli cabinet said it would give the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, more time. As anxiety rose that the conflict might escalate and spread, an international intervention effort intensified with the arrival of the United Nations secretary general and Russia's foreign minister. President Clinton was expected to decide soon whether to call an emergency summit meeting.</p>

        <p>Ex-C.I.A. Chief's Missing Files  Pentagon investigators have been unable to locate computer disks on which a former director of central intelligence, John M. Deutch, stored a journal containing classified information while he was working at the Defense Department. Mr. Deutch has declined to be interviewed about the whereabouts of the disks.
