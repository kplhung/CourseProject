        <p>Parents today are certainly better prepared than their parents were to talk with their teenagers about sex. But even though they have their post-sexual-revolution experiences to draw on and a wealth of books to guide them through the Big Talk, many still find it awkward and embarrassing.</p>
        <p>A survey announced last week by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research organization, found that parents were looking for help: the overwhelming majority wanted schools to provide more, not less, education on a whole range of sex-related topics once children reached their teenage years.</p>
        <p>While some of the discomfort comes with the territory, it has intensified in recent years because teenagers are having sex earlier. Thirty-one percent in the United States had intercourse by age 15 in 1995, up from 25 percent in 1980, according to a study in the July/August issue of the journal Family Planning Perspectives. And 8 percent of high school students had had intercourse by age 13, according to the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a poll of 15,349 students released in June by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
        <p>Though there are no statistics, casual sexual encounters other than intercourse also seem to be increasingly common among middle school students, some parents and doctors who treat adolescents say.</p>
        <p>Dr. Andrea Marx, a Manhattan doctor who specializes in adolescent medicine, said that in the last year or so several female patients in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades had mentioned ''hooking up,'' which means having oral sex and other intimate contact at parties with people they may hardly know.</p>
        <p>''Some say they have pressure to do it, some are judgmental about their friends who do it, but a lot of kids openly admit that they have sex just for the experience,'' Dr. Marx said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marx and other health professionals who work with adolescents say that one reason that some young teenagers have oral sex is that they think of it as ''safe,'' meaning not only that it cannot lead to pregnancy but that it cannot spread sexually transmitted diseases. In fact, those diseases can be spread this way.</p>
        <p>Some teenagers also assume that sexual experiences other than intercourse have little consequence emotionally.</p>
        <p>''It seems that a lot of kids now think that oral sex is no big deal,'' said Dr. Nathalie Bartle, associate dean of student affairs for MCP Hahnemann University in Philadelphia, who conducts focus groups on how mothers and daughters communicate about sex. ''But it can be a big deal in terms of how one feels about oneself.''</p>
        <p>Though most middle school students are not sexually active, the fact that many of them now are means that the nature and timing of the conversations about sex need to change, experts say. Instead of waiting until their teenagers are in high school to discuss ways to avoid peer pressure to have sex, parents should raise the subject when their children are in middle school.</p>
        <p>The question is, How? One mother, an author and lawyer in a suburb of Philadelphia, said she had always prided herself on being able to talk openly with her children. So, when she first heard the term hooking up earlier this year, she asked her 13-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son if they knew what it meant. To her surprise, both of them said it was discussed a lot in school.</p>
        <p>''A little bit of panic rose up in me because it seems like an activity that's far beyond their maturity level,'' said the woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her family's privacy.</p>
        <p>She said she wanted to warn her children about the potential emotional and physical consequences of hooking up but was afraid she would cut off further communication if she sounded preachy.</p>
        <p>Indeed, teenagers say the biggest mistake their parents make when discussing sex is that they spend too much time preaching and too little time listening, said Dr. Bartle, one of the authors of ''Venus in Blue Jeans,'' a book about mothers and daughters and their conversations about sex.</p>
        <p>Of course, teenagers are notoriously tight-lipped about such matters, especially with their parents, but doctors who work with adolescents have some suggestions on how to get them to open up.</p>
        <p>''Don't dive in and talk about sex first off,'' said Dr. William S. Pollack, director of the Center for Men at McLean Hospital, the Harvard affiliate, and author of ''Real Boys' Voices.'' ''Begin by asking about cliques at school or something else that's emotionally meaningful in their lives. That may touch off a conversation about sexuality.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pollack said that boys as well as girls needed guidance about the emotional aspects of sexual relationships, but that all too often boys' parents did not go beyond practical talk about things like using condoms. In his book, several boys said that they felt intense social pressure to lose their virginity but that they wanted to delay sex until they were in love.</p>
        <p>Experts say that parents should not be afraid to express their values. If parents think that premarital sex is wrong under all circumstances, they should say so and explain why. Otherwise, they should help teenagers understand how to know when they are ready to have a sexual relationship and how to protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases, as well as pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bartle said that many parents told her they feared that if they talked with their teenagers about sex, they would tempt them to have sex earlier. But if anything, such communication appears to have been beneficial. Studies show that teenagers whose parents talk with them openly are less likely than others to engage in risky behavior, like casual sex or neglecting to use birth control.</p>
        <p>No matter how well parent-adolescent conversations about sex are going, it is not uncommon for teenagers to end them abruptly by saying something like, ''I know that already.'' When met with this reaction, parents often jump to the conclusion that they do not need to talk further.</p>
        <p>But, Dr. Bartle said, teenagers are not always as knowledgeable as they think they are or as they lead their parents to believe. When they tell their parents to back off, it is often because they feel embarrassed.</p>
        <p>Many parents feel they simply cannot talk with their teenagers about things like sexually transmitted diseases, much less delicate topics like sexual desire. In that case, they should find a doctor or a well-informed adult to talk with their child about sex.</p>
        <p>Many pediatricians, gynecologists and family practitioners are trained to raise the subject sensitively. Indeed, at a meeting in March, the Society for Adolescent Medicine asked Dr. Bartle to conduct a workshop for doctors on ways to talk with teenagers about sex without scaring them off.</p>
        <p>''These are difficult conversations,'' Dr. Marx said. ''Parents shouldn't feel that they have to be their teenagers' only sources of information.''</p>
