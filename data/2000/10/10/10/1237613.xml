        <p>INDONESIA: MILITARY SHUFFLE -- President Abdurrahman Wahid appointed new chiefs of staff for the army and the navy as part of efforts to bring Indonesia's once all-powerful military under civilian control. Although no official reason was given for the shuffle, analysts and officials close to Mr. Wahid, left, said the move was needed to ensure that the Government had the full allegiance of the armed forces as it begins dismantling the military's illicit businesses and prosecuting officers for human rights abuses.</p>

        <p>INDIA: JAIL TERM FOR JAYALITHA -- Jayalitha Jayaram, the flamboyant former chief minister of Tamil Nadu, has been sentenced to three years in prison on corruption charges. Jayalitha, a former movie star known by her first name, was charged with buying a large tract of government land at a fraction of its value.</p>

        <p>INDIA: SURGERY FOR PREMIER -- Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, 76, was admitted to a Bombay hospital for planned surgery to replace his arthritic left knee. He is expected to remain in Bombay for 10 days before returning to New Delhi for further recuperation.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: ELECTION DAY -- Voters will choose a new Parliament today after five weeks of campaigning in a violent atmosphere that has led to 61 deaths. President Chandrika Kumaratunga and her People's Alliance Party are seeking a second six-year term.</p>

        <p>CHINA: SEIZED FOR SUING -- Two members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement were arrested after they sued President Jiang Zemin and two subordinates for cracking down on the group, its followers in Hong Kong said. The two, a Hong Kong resident and a mainland Chinese, were the first Falun Gong members to take legal action against the suppression, members in Hong Kong said. The two were seized on Sept. 7 by more than 10 policemen.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: FRENCH-LANGUAGE MILITANTS -- A French-language militant group, the French Self-Defense Brigade, claimed responsibility for three unexploded gasoline bombs found outside three Second Cup coffee shops in Montreal. Last month the group threatened a campaign of ''linguistic cleansing,'' warning that it would pick out businesses with English names. The police said no one was injured.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: TURKEY FLIES IN RELIEF -- Turkey became the ninth country to send a token relief flight to Baghdad, the latest in what has become an almost daily show of support for Iraq. The flight, which received clearance from the United Nations, came three weeks after France and Russia first challenged 10 years of United Nations flight sanctions on Iraq.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>IVORY COAST: EMBASSY IN PARIS ATTACKED -- Invading demonstrators broke windows and set fires as they vandalized Ivory Coast's embassy in Paris to protest the exclusion of former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara from Oct. 22 elections. The Ivory Coast, a former French colony, had one of the most stable governments in Africa until a military coup in December. Ivory Coast's Supreme Court has barred 15 candidates from running for the presidency against the head of the military junta, Gen. Robert Guei.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: SURVIVES VOTE -- A motion of no confidence in David Trimble, First Minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, by the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian Paisley failed, but the vote showed that the accord that set up the power-sharing legislature is losing support among the majority Protestant population. Mr. Trimble was accused of being the architect of a pact that was destroying the Royal Ulster Constabulary, letting the I.R.A. keep its arms, releasing terrorists from jail and giving the government of Ireland too much say in Ulster.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: BASQUES TIED TO SHOOTING -- Suspected Basque separatists shot and killed the senior prosecutor in Andalucia. The police said three people took part in the attack, ambushing Luis Portero, 59, as he returned to his home in Granada for lunch. Several hours after the shooting, a car bomb intended for the security forces at the scene exploded in a nearby street, a hallmark of the separatist group E. T. A.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: NATO WAR GAMES -- A NATO exercise involving 21,000 troops, 70 ships and 170 aircraft began with submarine maneuvers off the Turkish coast in the Aegean Sea. Seven nations are taking part in the exercise, which will extend through Oct. 25. The exercise brings Greek and Turkish forces side by side for a third time this year.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>LITHUANIA: LEFTISTS WIN, BUT FAIL -- A left-wing coalition headed by a former Communist leader won the most votes in parliamentary elections, but fell short of the support needed to form a government. The Social Democrats led by Algirdas Brazauskas won 49 seats in elections on Sunday, but their failure to win outright means parties will begin negotiating to forge a coalition. At least 71 seats are needed to control the legislature.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>CZECH REPUBLIC: NUCLEAR PLANT OPENS -- Over the objections of Austria, a nuclear power plant 40 miles from the Austrian border was activated after the operators got the go-ahead from the Czech State Office for Nuclear Safety. Austria has threatened to block the Czech Republic's entry to the European Union over the issue, and protesters have blocked border crossings into the republic.</p>
