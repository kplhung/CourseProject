        <p>Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed records from Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign and its media consulting firm to determine whether either played any role in mailing confidential Bush debate materials last month to an associate of Vice President Al Gore, law enforcement officials and Bush campaign officials said today.</p>
        <p>The subpoenas, issued late last week by a federal grand jury here, seek personnel records, time and attendance sheets and confidentiality contracts in which some campaign workers had promised not to divulge any sensitive information, the law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>Investigators are seeking a list of employees of the Bush campaign and Maverick Media, the campaign's advertising firm in Austin, Tex., who may have had access to the debate videotape and other internal briefing papers. The materials were mailed on Sept. 11 from Austin to Thomas J. Downey, a former Democratic congressman from New York who is a Gore adviser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Downey, who was involved in preparing the vice president for this month's presidential debates, immediately turned the materials over to the authorities on Sept. 13. But since then, the incident has led to a rancorous dispute between the campaigns, as each accused the other of engaging in underhanded tactics.</p>
        <p>The inquiry is being conducted at the Justice Department's headquarters by its public integrity section, which investigates corruption cases. Law enforcement officials said today that the criminal inquiry was still in a preliminary phase, and that no one had been summoned to testify before the grand jury.</p>
        <p>''We are cooperating fully with the investigation,'' Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said, ''because no one wants to get to the bottom of this more than us with the Bush campaign who are working tirelessly day in and day out to elect Governor Bush.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign declined to comment on the developments.</p>
        <p>Bush campaign officials said that Friday's subpoena sought materials that the campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh, had promised at a Sept. 15 meeting to give to the authorities.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said that they had uncovered no evidence that any senior campaign officials were responsible for the mailing of the tape, which showed Governor Bush answering questions from aides as he prepared for the debates.</p>
        <p>Federal investigators have been interviewing workers in both the Gore and Bush campaigns in recent days. A week ago, agents interviewed a Gore aide who was suspended for telling a friend about a ''mole,'' or informer for the Gore camp, within the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Thus far, the investigators have closely examined the role of Yvette Lozano, an assistant to Mark McKinnon, the head of Maverick Media. A security videotape showed that Ms. Lozano took a package to an Austin post office on the day the package was mailed to Mr. Downey.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lozano has denied sending the videotape. She has told several news organizations that the package she mailed contained a pair of pants that Mr. McKinnon was returning to Gap Inc. Mr. McKinnon has said the same thing.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign has repeatedly defended Ms. Lozano's loyalty.</p>
        <p>The subpoenas suggest that prosecutors had decided to move forward with an inquiry that they believe could be a case of mail fraud. Investigators had also considered pursing a case based on a theory that the transfer of the tape amounted to the interstate transportation of stolen property.</p>
        <p>But the officials cautioned that they were far from determining whether they might bring charges against anyone and had not even concluded whether a criminal prosecution would be pursued if they found that a law had been broken.</p>
        <p>The investigation has distracted both campaigns. Mr. McKinnon has hired a prominent defense lawyer, Rusty Hardin, to represent him, but Mr. Hardin said tonight: ''No significance at all should be attached to the fact that Mark and his company have hired me to represent them.  He's simply a man who is confused about this as anyone, and he just hopes that law enforcement gets to the bottom of it.''</p>
