        <p>Lucent Technologies has narrowed a review for the global advertising account of its yet-to-be-renamed microelectronics business -- which the company plans to spin off -- to four finalists from a list of nine. Initial spending was estimated at $20 million to $25 million.</p>

        <p>Ms. Sienko said that McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic, the agency that handles corporate advertising for Lucent, had also handled the microelectronics business. She said the agency was not participating in the review for the spinoff because of a conflict with another McCann client she declined to identify.</p>
