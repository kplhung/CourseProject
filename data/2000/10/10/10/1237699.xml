        <p>Charlie Wilson  S.O.B.'s</p>
        <p>Charlie Wilson wooed the audience  on Friday night like an ex-boyfriend hoping for another chance. He teased, pleaded and preened. He called on memories and showed what he'd been up to lately. And he confirmed that he was still the singer and showman he was in the early 1980's, when he led the Gap Band through its biggest hits.</p>

        <p>Charlie Wilson  S.O.B.'s</p>
        <p>Charlie Wilson wooed the audience  on Friday night like an ex-boyfriend hoping for another chance. He teased, pleaded and preened. He called on memories and showed what he'd been up to lately. And he confirmed that he was still the singer and showman he was in the early 1980's, when he led the Gap Band through its biggest hits.</p>
        <p>The Gap Band latched on to prime 1970's funk -- Parliament's synthesizer-bottomed grooves, Earth Wind and Fire's vocal harmony -- while Mr. Wilson sang like a less pious Stevie Wonder. By 1980, already aware of an up-and-coming music called hip-hop, Mr. Wilson also recited rhymes in dance tunes.</p>
        <p>Though the Gap Band persevered into the 90's, he has now made a solo album, ''Bridging the Gap'' (Major Hits/Universal), keeping up with recent rhythm-and-blues. New songs used the twitchy, stop-and-start grooves of Timbaland and Shek'spere or like Babyface threaded an acoustic guitar through a ballad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson, calling himself Uncle Charlie, held on to his old persona: a good-natured, slightly sleazy come-on artist. In a duet with a younger guest singer, Case, Mr. Wilson was a mentor of love; alongside him, Case sounded callow. In another song, using a melody phrase from Sisqo's ''Thong Song,'' he tried to take home a stripper, offering to make up for any tips she might lose.</p>
        <p>With his earthy, limber voice, Mr. Wilson crooned husky lines and climbed to exultant high notes, bounced responses off his backup singers or tossed off breezy scat phrases. Like other funk professionals, he used gospel dynamics to proclaim secular desires.</p>
        <p>His showpiece was his new single, ''Without You.'' He crooned low, husky lines, then opened up for elaborate turns. He preached over piano arpeggios -- ''I won't let the devil get me down tonight!'' -- and insisted he wasn't afraid to cry. ''Let me take my pimp hat off!'' he declared. ''Let me take my player coat off!'' He fell to his knees, moaning an apology, begging the woman to return; finally, he exulted, ''I feel a spirit coming on!'' Then it was back to party songs: the Gap Band's familiar good-time spirit.</p>
