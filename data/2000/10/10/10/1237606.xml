        <p>American pop would be healthier without roots music. That is, it would be best if the category could be eliminated because of more general interest in blues, folk, hard country, bluegrass and all the other styles it holds.</p>
        <p>The roots concept is protective, but it conveys motion backward, when most artists want to go forward. Roots music is best when it defies its own implications, stressing imagination that shines toward the future.  Rounder Records, America's most prominent independent roots-oriented label, has succeeded by subtly stretching the genres it promotes. Last Tuesday at Town Hall, a 30th-anniversary celebration for the Boston-based company acknowledged roots conservatism but stressed the energy mavericks bring.</p>
        <p>Appropriately, Alison Krauss and Union Station were the headliners. Ms. Krauss has been Rounder's biggest source of income since her profile shot sky high in 1995 with the surprise double-platinum success of the compilation ''Now That I've Found You.'' A former bluegrass fiddle prodigy who broke through with adult-pop songs that stressed her enchanting soprano, she breaks the rules with integrity.</p>
        <p>The evening's set started with selections from the band's newest album, ''Forget About It,'' which neatly reverses bluegrass's strategy by slowing and quieting country down instead of speeding it up. Ms. Krauss was a bit too self-effacing early on; the music was beautiful, augmented by the sensitive Dobro playing of guest virtuoso Jerry Douglas, but she seemed almost embarrased by the crowd's appreciation.</p>
        <p>She loosened up when the tempo increased and her band mates got a chance to shine. Ms. Krauss clearly still treasured playing with these masters, falling into place as a graceful fiddler when she wasn't singing. Her vocals were enhanced by the harmony singing of the guitarist Dan Tyminski and Mr. Douglas's breathtaking solos. Ms. Krauss's focus on her collaborators made room for them to experiment together.</p>
        <p>Preceding Ms. Krauss was Jimmie Dale Gilmore, another gentle rebel with a loyal following. Since his hippie days in the definitive bohemian country band the Flatlanders, this singer, with his unearthly tenor, has challenged norms simply by being himself. After a disappointing mid-1990's foray into the corporate music industry, he returned to independence with this year's lovely, well-grounded Rounder-distributed album, ''One Endless Night.''</p>
        <p>Backed by an outstanding band that featured the dueling guitarists Chris Gage and Rob Gjerso, Mr. Gilmore was as warm as ever, telling rambling stories and laughing through both high points and flubs. He also provided the night's most heartfelt moment. Dedicating ''Reunion,'' by his former wife Jo Carol Pierce, to his very recently deceased father, Mr. Gilmore choked up halfway through. Mr. Gage took up the duet with band member Christine Albert. Mr. Gilmore chimed in at the last moment, a hard-earned serenity returning to his face.</p>
        <p>The most traditional band came first. Balfa Toujours is a Cajun group with a line to that bayou legacy: its leader, Christine Balfa, is the daughter of the legendary Louisiana fiddler Dewey Balfa. Ms. Balfa and her husband, the accordionist Dirk Powell, discussed every song the quartet played with the precision of museum docents. The music jumped forward, though, when it incorporated zydeceo, early rock and blues. Even this scholarly bunch found its stride wandering from strict form.</p>
