        <p>Two brothers, John and Mark Hirschbeck, will work on the same umpiring crew for the American League Championship Series, while the 30-year veteran Bruce Froemming will be behind the plate for the National League Championship Series opener.</p>
        <p>John Hirschbeck will call balls and strikes tonight when the Seattle Mariners play the Yankees in New York. In addition to the Hirschbecks, other umpires for the A.L.C.S. will be Wally Bell, Angel Hernandez, Gerry Davis and Randy Marsh.</p>
        <p>The N.L.C.S. starts tomorrow night with the Mets playing the Cardinals at St. Louis. Along with Froemming, the crew will include Tim Tschida, Ed Rapuano, Dale Scott, Dana DeMuth and Steve Rippley.</p>
        <p>Froemming will be handling his 10th league championship series. Bell and Hernandez, who worked in the N.L. before major league umpires merged this season, will be appearing in their first league championship series. (AP)</p>
        <p>MEDIA COMPANY PURSUES RED SOX: John Harrington, chief executive of the Boston Red Sox, said a news media company was among those that have expressed interest in buying the team, The Boston Globe reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>Since Harrington said Friday that the Red Sox were being put up for sale by the Yawkey Trust, the team's majority general partner since 1987, he said he has heard from more than 30 potential buyers and expects more inquiries, The Globe reported. He would not identify any of the potential bidders.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox, one of baseball's most prestigious franchises, could fetch a Major League Baseball-record $500 million if the team gets a new stadium, analysts said. They have played in Fenway Park, currently the oldest and smallest of the 30 major league stadiums, since 1912.</p>
        <p>Harrington plans to meet with baseball officials this week to discuss the sale of the team, The Globe reported.</p>
        <p>He said Friday that he preferred to sell to someone from New England and that the team would not be moved from Boston.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox, who last won a World Series in 1918, were put up for sale after the Yawkey Trust said it was having trouble getting financing for a new $665 million ballpark, which the team hoped to open by 2004.</p>
        <p>Under an agreement with the Massachusetts Legislature, the team must pay $350 million for construction costs on the new stadium. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>A's COACH ON PIRATES' LIST: With the Oakland Athletics now out of the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Pirates are expected to include the A's bench coach, Ken Macha, a onetime Pirates player, on their short list of managerial candidates.</p>
        <p>The Pirates' owner, Kevin McClatchy, and General Manager Cam Bonifay will begin interviewing candidates later this week to succeed Gene Lamont, fired Oct. 2 after a fourth successive losing season.</p>
        <p>The Pirates are coming off an eighth consecutive losing season, their longest such streak in more than 40 years, and they want to hire a manager who not only can perform a turnaround but can help sell tickets to the new PNC Park.</p>
        <p>The new manager might not necessarily have to be a proven manager, such as the recently fired Buck Showalter of Arizona, who is believed to be on the Pirates' list. As Bonifay has noted, the Pirates hired Jim Leyland, a Chicago White Sox coach with no previous major league managerial experience, in 1986 and he led them to their last three division championships in 1990-92.</p>
        <p>Bonifay, who conducted only a cursory search before recommending Lamont's hiring in 1996, spent last week forming a list of candidates he and McClatchy will interview. The list includes several minority candidates -- a prerequisite set down by Commissioner Bud Selig as mandatory for any such search.</p>
        <p>McClatchy grew up a Giants fan and has long admired Giants Manager Dusty Baker, who does not have a contract for next season. However, it is unlikely Baker would leave a pennant contender like the Giants, who were eliminated from the N.L. playoffs Sunday by the Mets, for a losing franchise like the Pirates.</p>
        <p>However, there appears to be no shortage of candidates to become only the fourth Pirates manager since 1977, joining Chuck Tanner (1977-85), Leyland (1986-96) and Lamont (1997-00) (AP)</p>
