        <p>In the space of 12 hours yesterday, a New Jersey bridge was the site of two fatal crashes that killed five people and critically injured one.</p>
        <p>In both cases, officials said, cars using the Wittpenn Bridge to cross the Hackensack River from Jersey City to Kearny were struck by oncoming trucks as they reached a curve in the four-lane roadway.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City said the stretch of bridge has been the scene of numerous accidents, but neither he nor the state Department of Transportation could provide statistics yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler said the city would ask the Department of Transportation to put a temporary divider between the opposing lanes of the bridge, which is state property.</p>
        <p>''The city is absolutely going to be insisting that the state put up dividers,'' Mr. Schundler said. ''It may be coincidence that you have two fatal accidents on the same bridge in one day, but we can do something to minimize the chances of accidents happening.''</p>
        <p>Also, more police officers will be assigned to enforce speed limits on the bridge, the mayor said.</p>
        <p>In the first accident, at 1:07 a.m., a 19-year-old woman traveling west in a Nissan sedan was killed when she crossed into the eastbound lanes and was struck head-on by a garbage truck, the police said.</p>
        <p>In the second accident, at 12:41 p.m., a Toyota Corolla carrying two women and three men, all believed to be in their late teens or early 20's, also crossed into the eastbound lanes. The Corolla was struck by another car, whose driver was unhurt, and ended up perpendicular to eastbound traffic.</p>
        <p>A tractor-trailer then broadsided the car, flattening it and killing three people instantly, the police said. A fourth person died en route to Jersey City Medical Center. The car's fifth occupant, a woman, was in critical condition there yesterday evening.</p>
        <p>The victims' identities were withheld pending notification of their families. But a spokesman at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark confirmed that the Corolla was registered on the campus.</p>
        <p>Neither truck driver was harmed, and no charges were filed.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 11, 2000, Wednesday  A map yesterday with an article about two fatal crashes on the Wittpenn Bridge in Jersey City misidentified the Hudson River tunnel east of the bridge. It is the Holland Tunnel, not the Lincoln.</p>
