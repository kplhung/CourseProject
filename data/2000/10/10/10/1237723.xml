        <p>Buster Olney analyzes the American League Championship Series, which begins tonight at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>YANKEES  87-74, A.L. East champion  vs  SEATTLE  91-71, wild card</p>
        <p>Season series: Seattle won 6 of 10</p>
        <p>PITCHING</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre navigated the Yankees through the first round of the playoffs with what was essentially a six-man staff. Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez, Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson and Mariano Rivera pitched 41 out of the 44 innings, and the only time Torre went beyond those six was late in the Game 4 blowout. But because of the scrambling necessary to knock off Oakland, the rotation is muddled, and Torre will have to turn to Denny Neagle, one of the Great Unknowns in the American League Championship Series, to start Game 1. After that, it figures that Hernandez will start Game 2, Pettitte Game 3 (this will allow him to be fully rested) and Clemens Game 4. The Yankees' staff matches up better against Seattle than it did against Oakland, but the Mariners' lineup is more dangerous in the middle. The Yankees merely pitched around Jason Giambi in the first round, but they cannot do this against the Mariners. Alex Rodriguez bats third and Edgar Martinez fourth, and it will be tantamount to keep the No. 1 and No. 2 hitters off the bases ahead of them. If they do, the Yankees will probably try to pitch around Rodriguez and challenge Martinez with fastballs high and inside.</p>
        <p>The assumption every year has been that Manager Lou Piniella would eventually allow his frustration to dictate the way he used his bullpen, and he either burned out relievers he trusted or cast aside relievers he didn't like. But Piniella has changed his ways, and the Mariners have a deep and strong bullpen, a group capable of racking up strikeouts with runners on base. The closer is Kazuhiro Sasaki, who will probably win the American League's rookie of the year award, after accumulating 37 saves during the regular season. Jose Mesa pitched poorly during the regular season, but he was terrific against Chicago in the first round, throwing two scoreless innings. Jose Paniagua throws hard, and the left-hander Arthur Rhodes will probably play a special role in this series, if the Mariners' starters are effective. Freddy Garcia is really the only member of the Seattle rotation capable of dominating the hitters, but John Halama, Aaron Sele and Paul Abbott are gritty veterans. Sele, armed with a good curveball, was a member of the Texas Rangers the last two seasons and must shrug off his own personal memories of the Yankees' sweeps. Abbott, the Game 4 starter, has pitched effectively against the Yankees this season, always managing to avoid disaster. The left-hander Jamie Moyer is out for the series after being injured over the weekend.</p>
        <p>OFFENSE</p>
        <p>The late-season slide extended into the division series, in which the Yankees batted .244. But by Game 5 on Sunday, the Yankees' attack seemed to be stirring to life. David Justice's home run was their first in 66 innings, and right fielder Paul O'Neill had some of the best swings he has had in weeks, hustling out a double in the ninth inning, his first extra-base hit since Sept. 6. Tino Martinez drove the ball against Oakland, batting .421. What may be the best sign for the Yankees is that Chuck Knoblauch is playing with an attitude again. He seems to be at his best when he is besieged, when there is some outside issue that causes him to focus harder. When his throwing problems blossomed in the playoffs last year and he was under the news media's microscope, he responded strongly; this year, Torre benched him in Games 2, 3 and 4, and Knoblauch appears angry at the organization and the news media portrayals of his reaction. He returned to the lineup in Game 5 and ripped two hits in the first inning. Torre is likely to stick with the same alignment to begin the A.L.C.S., with Knoblauch at designated hitter and Luis Sojo at second base.</p>
        <p>The Mariners are like the Oakland Athletics, in some ways -- they don't hit for a high average (ranking 12th in the A.L. this year), but they are patient, draw walks (first in A.L.) and will drive up the pitch counts of the opposing starters. Even at his advanced age, the leadoff batter Rickey Henderson is dangerous, getting on base constantly. The middle of the lineup is scary, with shortstop Alex Rodriguez (41 homers, 132 runs batted in) hitting third and designated hitter Edgar Martinez (145 R.B.I.) fourth. The rest of the batting order is somewhat benign, but like a sleeping rattlesnake. The former Met John Olerud hit only 13 homers during the regular season, yet is a threat; just ask Randy Johnson, who learned about this during the '99 playoffs. Jay Buhner, Mark McLemore, Stan Javier, Joe Oliver and David Bell are all savvy veterans who have delivered big hits in their careers.</p>
        <p>DEFENSE</p>
        <p>This series will be played in two spacious parks that can greatly favor pitchers, Yankee Stadium and Safeco Field, making defense a premium. Sojo doesn't have much range, but he proved once again against Oakland that he is exceptional at turning double plays, an important skill in the games Pettitte will pitch against the Mariners' predominantly right-handed lineup. Scott Brosius has been excellent at third, Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez solid at short and first. The Athletics repeatedly challenged O'Neill's throwing arm in the first round, something the Mariners' scouts surely noted. Justice is not moving well in left, but he has been getting to every ball he needs to. Catcher Jorge Posada's strong throwing arm will be a factor.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will not get help from the Mariners the way they did from Oakland. Seattle is unspectacular defensively, even weak in some areas, with the rangeless McLemore at second and the unpredictable Henderson in left field. But Mike Cameron is a good center fielder, Rodriguez is a solid shortstop, Olerud is a big target for the infielders at first and the catchers Oliver and Dan Wilson are both experienced. They made only 99 errors all season, the second fewest in the league behind Cleveland's 72.</p>
        <p>ON THE BASES</p>
        <p>The Yankees didn't run much in the first round because they were rarely on base. But Knoblauch's aggressiveness goes in streaks, and that he was willing to run and steal a base in Game 1 probably means he will be attacking the Mariners on the base paths. All of the Seattle starters generally stay within the strike zone and will give the Yankees the opportunity to make contact, to put on hit-and-run plays; and with Brosius, Sojo, Jeter and O'Neill, Torre does have a handful of players with whom to try that. The Yankees will run aggressively any time Rickey Henderson touches the ball, because his might be the worst throwing arm of any outfielder in baseball.</p>
        <p>Seattle ranked second in the league behind Baltimore in stealing bases, but with the exception of Henderson -- the career-leading base stealer -- the Mariners have an approach similar to that of the Yankees. If the situation is right, they will run: McLemore swiped 30 bases, Cameron can steal a base, Javier will be put in motion. A throw to second made by Yankees catcher Jorge Posada was timed at a stunning 1.69 seconds in the last week of the season, and while Posada does not have the raw gun of the Rangers' Ivan Rodriguez, he can shut down an opponent's running game. The Mariners will challenge Yankee outfielders; the Seattle third-base coach, Larry Bowa, is aggressive.</p>
        <p>X-FACTOR</p>
        <p>There was an unusual exuberance to the Yankees after they eliminated Oakland on Sunday night. There were so many reasons they could have lost in the first round -- the late-season slump that haunted them, the loss of home-field advantage, the shortened series, the lackluster offense, flying all the way across the country to wrap up the series. But the Yankees survived, and they will take on the Mariners with confidence.</p>
        <p>If he has command, Rhodes will be like kryptonite to the Yankees' mostly left-handed lineup, because he is left-handed and throws very hard. If the Mariners can reach the sixth or seventh innings with leads, Rhodes will probably be asked to relay those leads to Sasaki. Rhodes needs regular rest, and with two off days built into this series, he will be specially equipped.</p>
