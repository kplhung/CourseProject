        <p>When the price of oil tripled in the mid-1970's, Americans' consumption of gasoline fell sharply. Congress approved sweeping new rules calling for a doubling of the fuel efficiency of cars. Gasoline-sipping Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas became some of the most popular cars on the road, shaking the confidence of the American automobile industry.</p>
        <p>Over the last two years, energy prices have tripled again, but one would hardly know it from looking at America's roads.</p>
        <p>Few people have sharply cut back on their driving or have begun shopping for cars based primarily on fuel efficiency, according to interviews around the country and data from the government and auto industry.  The nation is on pace to use almost the same amount of gasoline as it did last year, which was the most ever. Sport-utility vehicles and other trucks continue to gain market share slowly.</p>
        <p>Instead, Americans are tinkering.</p>
        <p>Thousands of drivers have stopped using expensive premium gasoline, and some families have tried to eliminate the small number of trips they deem unnecessary. Sales of the very largest S.U.V.'s have slipped, although analysts remain unsure of the reason.</p>
        <p>''We've seen some effect'' of higher gas prices, said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, ''but it's small.''</p>
        <p>A large part of the difference between then and now springs from the fact that today there are no actual oil shortages or gas station lines. By themselves, higher gas prices tend to change people's behavior only gradually, economists say.</p>
        <p>In addition, even after rising steadily for the last 20 months gas prices remain significantly lower, adjusted for inflation, than they were in the 1970's and 1980's. Perhaps equally important, upper income consumers, who are relatively indifferent to gas prices, consume a larger share of gas than they once did because of their affinity for S.U.V.'s.</p>
        <p>Oil demand, consequently, shows little sign of abating in the United States. With Americans accounting for about one quarter of the world's energy consumption, the strength of gasoline demand in recent years is a major reason, economists say, that prices are at their current level.</p>
        <p>Certainly the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has contributed to the situation by tightening oil supplies. And demand for oil has picked up elsewhere, too, particularly as Asia's economies have recovered from their financial squeeze. Yet America's underlying energy use has received far less attention than the other culprits that the major-party nominees for president have castigated: the United States government and big oil companies.</p>
        <p>Some 60 percent of the public reports being worried about energy costs, according to the Gallup Organization. That helps explain why both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have made the topic an important issue during the campaign's final weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has proposed increasing oil supplies by allowing energy companies to drill in parts of Alaska that the Clinton administration wants to keep environmentally protected. Mr. Gore, by contrast, has accused large oil companies of price-gouging and has promised to provide incentives to pursue alternative energy sources.</p>
        <p>For all the political drumbeating, though, the reaction by consumers remains relatively mild.</p>
        <p>''People are reluctant to change their driving habits unless they're forced to do it in a dramatic way,'' said Christopher W. Cedergren, an analyst at Nextrend, a market research firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif., that has been interviewing S.U.V. owners in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Take Karyn Fitzpatrick, for example. When she was filling the tank of her Volkswagen Beetle during the oil crisis of the mid-1970's, she liked to think about all the people who drove larger cars than she did. ''I remember feeling, 'Ha, ha, ha,' '' said Ms. Fitzpatrick, who needed to stop for gasoline only once every two weeks.</p>
        <p>These days, Ms. Fitzpatrick, a 45-year-old real estate agent in Southern California, drives a year-old Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicle that easily holds her husband and two children. After the tripling of crude oil prices in the last two years, it costs about $70 to fill the tank. ''Now it's ha, ha, ha on me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Fitzpatrick has no plans to return to the old days and begin shopping for a smaller, more fuel-efficient car. Instead, she is using her eight-passenger, V-8 Suburban less often and driving the family's Mercedes to work. Her husband, she said, has begun urging her to switch to a lower grade of gasoline, and they may consider buying a smaller sport utility if gas prices climb further.</p>
        <p>While the Fitzpatricks have considerably more money than the average family, they typify the changing tastes of American drivers.</p>
        <p>Today, the average owner of a large S.U.V. -- which typically goes about 13 miles on a gallon of gas -- is part of a family with $103,000 in annual income, according to General Motors. Those people are less sensitive than others to fluctuations in gas prices, particularly because gas prices have actually fallen over the last two decades. In 1980, for example, a gallon of regular unleaded gas cost over $2.50 in today's dollars, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.; this year, it has cost, on average, around $1.50.</p>
        <p>''A 50 percent increase in the price of gasoline is not as significant as a 50 percent increase in the price of gasoline was in 1974,'' said David Greene, a corporate fellow at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. Today, many people are ''more concerned about whether they have leather seats and what kind of stereo they have and the vehicle's horsepower than fuel economy,'' he added.</p>
        <p>This summer, Americans spent about 2.7 percent of their after-tax income on gasoline and fuel, Economy.com reports, and the number has not exceeded 3 percent since the end of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf war. In the early 1980's, gasoline spending reached as high as 6 percent of income, over double its current level.</p>
        <p>Even though both gas prices and borrowing costs have risen over the last year, neither increase has been big enough to trip up the light-truck boom. Together, minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles accounted for nearly half of all new vehicles bought in the United States during the first nine months of the year, said Mark Cornelius, the president of Morgan &amp; Company, an automotive consulting firm in West Olive, Mich.</p>
        <p>The truck-based vehicles' increased popularity also helped reverse the decade-long decline in Americans' per-capita consumption of gas that began in the mid-1970's. That decline was set off by the federal government's 1975 passage of fuel-economy standards and the shift in consumer preferences toward more fuel-efficient cars. The rules for light trucks are less strict, though, and as more Americans have bought minivans and S.U.V.'s, the average fuel economy of new vehicles has fallen by about 7 percent since 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency said. It is now at the same level as it was in 1980.</p>
        <p>For many drivers today, spending a few extra dollars -- or even $10 or $20 more -- when they go the pump is a small price for being in a vehicle that is not dwarfed by others on the road.</p>
        <p>''Driving a small car now would be like taking a knife to a gun fight,'' said Doug Johnson, who owns a small construction company in Austin, Tex. Mr. Johnson and his wife once drove Volvos, he said. Today, she drives an S.U.V.; he drives a pickup truck.</p>
        <p>''As much as I'd like to be more fuel conscious, I'm not going to compromise my kids' safety,'' he said. (Federal research has shown S.U.V.'s to be no safer for their drivers than cars, but some consumers continue to name safety as a reason for their appeal.)</p>
        <p>Anyway, Mr. Johnson said, ''higher gas prices don't make that much difference in the total cost of owning a car.''</p>
        <p>One sign that gas prices may be playing some role in consumers' purchases is the slipping popularity of the largest sport utility vehicles. Last month, sales of large S.U.V.'s fell 10 percent, compared with Sept. 1999, while sales of midsize and small trucks gained slightly. Auto analysts remain unsure about the reasons, saying mediocre stock market returns and the introduction of newer car-based models could be having as much of an effect as gas prices.</p>
        <p>Brenda Van Loggem, a visiting nurse who lives in Bronxville, N.Y., faces a decision next month when the lease on her Ford Explorer Sport expires. With her gas bills climbing, she said she might switch to a four-cylinder truck instead of the six-cylinder one she now owns.</p>
        <p>She does not expect to buy a car, though. ''You get used to driving one of these,'' said Ms. Van Loggem, while standing in the parking lot of a Westchester County shopping mall last weekend. ''It's nice to be high up, and I think it's safer.''</p>
        <p>The most noticeable reaction among consumers has come in their decision to shun the more expensive types of gasoline that car manufacturers and oil companies say help some vehicles run more smoothly.  Through the first seven months of the year, sales of midgrade and premium gas together have fallen 21 percent, the Energy Department reported. By contrast, sales of regular gasoline -- which is typically about 10 percent cheaper -- grew by 5 percent, and it now accounts for more than three out of every four gallons sold.</p>
        <p>''In people's minds, they're not giving anything up because they probably don't detect any difference in performance'' between premium and regular gasoline, Mr. Cedergren said. ''They're getting the same thing for less money.''</p>
        <p>Cutting back on driving has been a less common reaction, largely because most people cannot quickly change the manner in which they commute to work, run errands or pick up children from school. (The Gallup poll did not ask whether consumers' concern had caused them to act differently, but it did show an even higher level of worry among people with low or moderate incomes.)</p>
        <p>Americans are using roughly the same amount of gasoline that they did last year, and the Department of Energy projects that the number will remain flat or perhaps even decline slightly by the end of the year. It would be the first decline since 1980.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Americans are coping as best they can with high gasoline prices. Stacy Coulson, a pastry chef who recently moved from New Jersey to Los Angeles, lives with her sister. They have decided to drive only Ms. Coulson's 1997 Nissan pickup truck and not her sister's Pontiac Grand Am, which is less fuel efficient.</p>
        <p>They also do not buy premium gas, avoid crowded freeways, drive out of their way at times to a less expensive gas station and go to the grocery store only once a week. ''I limit my mileage, and I don't drive on the highway because it's stop and go,'' Ms. Coulson said.</p>
        <p>Stop and go, she noted, because of all the other drivers still out there.</p>
