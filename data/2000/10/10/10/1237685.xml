        <p>BROOKLYN: MAN SHOOTS INTRUDERS  Two would-be robbers were thwarted yesterday when the owner of a Brooklyn card shop drew a pistol and shot them both, the police said. The authorities said the owner, Ming Chen, 43, fired several shots at the men inside Joe's Card Store on Cortelyou Road after one pointed a semiautomatic pistol at him and demanded money. One of the men, James Baylor, was in critical condition at Kings County Hospital Center with four gunshot wounds. The other, Antoine Miles, was struck once in the abdomen and was in stable condition, the authorities said. Both men were charged with attempted robbery and criminal possession of a weapon. Mr. Chen, who the police said used a legally registered pistol, was not injured or charged.</p>

        <p>GARDEN CITY: CURB OF COUNTY EXECUTIVE URGED  A referendum on whether to restrict the Nassau County executive's ability to award certain contracts without competitive bidding will be placed before voters on Nov. 7. If adopted, the change would make what is now a governmental agreement into a matter of law: the County Legislature's Rules Committee can approve personal service contracts, like those with law or computer firms, which are often worth $25,000 or more. The same arrangement is now in effect as an an agreement between Judith A. Jacobs, the Legislature's presiding officer, and the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, above, said Darren Bloch, Ms. Jacobs's chief of staff.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: 25 MILLION ROTTING TIRES  Legislation signed late last week by Gov. George E. Pataki is the state's latest attempt to solve a decades-old problem: what to do with 25 million tires rotting in illegal dumps. The problem has become more urgent because the dumps are also prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes. West Nile virus, which has sickened at least 17 people in New York City and New Jersey and killed one this year, is carried by mosquitoes. The dumps could become larger as a result of the recent nationwide recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires. The law creates the State Council on Scrap Tire Management, which will give grants to businesses to recycle dumped tires.</p>

        <p>WILDWOOD: REDEVELOPMENT PLAN  For years preservationists have championed the pink flamingos and plastic palms of the 1950's motels in the struggling beach resort town of Wildwood. Yesterday, the city officially embraced its low-brow culture by presenting a $40 million redevelopment plan that would include a neon gateway arch on Rio Grande Avenue and eliminate a pedestrian mall on Pacific Avenue, the main commercial strip. Officials said the 1987 mall was a misguided attempt to compete with nearby Cape May, a beach resort of Victorian inns. ''We are not Cape May,'' Mayor Duane Sloan said. ''We need to embrace our character and not abandon it.'' Steve Strunsky (NYT)</p>
        <p>TRENTON: SCHOOLS TO GET COMPUTERS  New computers will soon be arriving to start computer centers in places like housing projects, to bridge a gap between students at urban schools and those in the suburbs. The state has granted 26 school districts a total of $4.8 million to establish innovative computer programs to reach disadvantaged children and their parents who have little access to such technology. The program will eventually total $7.4 million in federal aid once another 24 grants are distributed.</p>

        <p>FAIRFIELD: GREAT PUMPKIN RECOVERED  Four men, age 17 to 21, were charged with larceny after they were found with a 340-pound pumpkin in the front seat of their car. The police said it was stolen over the weekend from the front porch of its grower's house. Lt. Richard Gunter said the police spotted an immense object on Sunday morning protruding from the front seat of a car driven by Jason Razowski, 19, of Derby. The front passenger door could not be closed because of the pumpkin, and when Mr. Razowski was questioned, the police said, he said he and three friends picked up the pumpkin on the side of the road.</p>

        <p>LITCHFIELD: TOWN OPPOSES HISTORIC HOUSE  The man seeking to rebuild the childhood home of Harriet Beecher Stowe, at left, the author of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' has hit a snag. The man, Chandler Saint, has not been able to find a temporary or permanent site for the house, which was dismantled and is now stored in two trailers on state land. The Litchfield Historic District Commission denied Mr. Saint permission to construct a building to cover the trailers because the building would violate local zoning laws. And in late August, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said that he did not want to override local laws to store the dismantled house.</p>
