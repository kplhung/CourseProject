        <p>Irving Hecht says there is some precedent for the nasty battle over Congregation Ahavath Achim in this tiny Catskills town.</p>
        <p>''Maybe you've heard this,'' said Mr. Hecht, a member of the congregation. ''Where you see two Jews, there are three synagogues.''</p>
        <p>The problem in Swan Lake, though, is that there are two groups of Jews fighting over one synagogue.</p>
        <p>One result is a legal and ecclesiastical issue about what defines membership in a religious congregation. But the dispute also provides a window on the Catskills culture wars, in which an old, middle-class, assimilationist sensibility has come under siege from a newly arrived strain of ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Judaism.</p>
        <p>The immediate battle is a lawsuit filed in September in which the modern Orthodox members of Congregation Ahavath Achim (pronounced a-hah-VAHT a-KHEEM), most of them local homeowners, and some of them members for decades, say some Hasidic newcomers engineered what amounts to a hostile takeover.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit claims that a few Hasidim, who vacation here in the summer but spend most of the year in Brooklyn, diverted the synagogue's money to a separate bank account, packed a membership meeting with people falsely claiming to be members and installed their own trustees and officers. The defendants reply that by praying regularly at the synagogue during the summer and donating money, the newcomers rightfully became members, and the congregation's true majority.</p>
        <p>The legal issue may turn on a little-used state law written in 1895 that defines membership in a religious congregation. The issue within the synagogue will depend on whether the two different Jewish groups can find a way to get along.</p>
        <p>Congregation Ahavath Achim (the name means ''the people of brotherly love'' in Hebrew) is more than 70 years old, one of about 20 synagogues built before World War II by Jews who settled in Sullivan County as farmers and merchants. Its spiritual leader, Rabbi Israel Einhorn, said that when he arrived here about 20 years ago, the generation of settlers and the synagogue's membership were dwindling. By that time, too, many Jewish vacationers had abandoned the borscht belt. But by the 1990's, the synagogue was gaining members from a new housing development built across the road. At the same time, other city people, Hasidim from Brooklyn, began to fill the nearby summer bungalow colonies.</p>
        <p>Orthodox by charter, the synagogue invited the new Hasidic neighbors to use the small, graceful white building. And in 1997, the synagogue president, Irving Schwartz, made another welcoming gesture: he asked Mordechai Rosenberger, the owner of a bungalow colony and grocery for Hasidic Jews, to be a vice president.</p>
        <p>The ultra-Orthodox who began going to the synagogue are described by people here as members of the Pupa and Satmar sects, among the more insular Hasidic groups. They stayed largely apart from the regular congregants, who vary in degrees of strictness but are mostly modern Orthodox.</p>
        <p>Some animosity arose when Mr. Rosenberger formed a separate corporation to build a ritual bath, which opened in 1999 next to the synagogue.</p>
        <p>When the new worshipers took down the American and Israeli flags in front of the sanctuary, rolled them up and laid them on the floor -- they objected to the appearance of praying to temporal powers -- the older congregants were incensed.</p>
        <p>''They should be welcome to come in here, but don't take away my house of worship,'' said Bill Liblick, a longtime member, and a former radio talk show host who was the ''relationship court'' judge on ''The Ricki Lake Show.'' He complained that when he rose to say a memorial prayer for his mother, Hasidic men in the pews motioned and murmured in Yiddish that he was not devout enough to use the pulpit.</p>
        <p>Before long, the two factions found themselves completely at odds.</p>
        <p>The synagogue leaders refer in the suit to ''rogue Hasidic summer residents.''</p>
        <p>The defendants, back in Brooklyn since about Labor Day, declined to be interviewed, and their lawyer, Perry E. Meltzer, said he could not provide any information about his clients. Mr. Meltzer did say, though, that ''before the Hasidim became active, the synagogue was almost dead.''</p>
        <p>This summer, tensions grew over charity money collected at services. In court documents, Mr. Rosenberger, who was in charge of all the collections, said the treasurer, Stuart Krause, was never available to handle them. Mr. Krause said it was ''absurd to even suggest'' that he would not take contributions.</p>
        <p>The synagogue, by habit agreeably loose about rules of governance, functioned for years without attention to a charter or bylaws and without trustees. The only requirement for membership was annual dues of $75, to be collected by the treasurer.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 6, the officers convened a membership meeting with about 100 regulars, expecting the usual uncontested elections, and found more than 100 Hasidim insisting that they had given Mr. Rosenberger checks for membership dues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz adjourned the meeting in confusion, and a few days later, Mr. Rosenberger called a  membership meeting for Aug. 20. This time, the longtime synagogue members did not attend, and Mr. Rosenberger's followers elected new  officers and a board of trustees.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, on Aug. 18, court documents show, Mr. Rosenberger opened a bank account in the synagogue's name; he said in court papers that he did so because Mr. Krause would not accept the money from the Hasidim.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs say Mr. Rosenberger and a handful of others were diverting money from the treasury; they also contend that Mr. Rosenberger accepted a donation of property to the synagogue and had the deed given to his separate corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz filed suit on Sept. 1 and won a temporary injunction forbidding the defendants to take any actions affecting the synagogue. Justice Mark M. Meddaugh of State Supreme Court in Sullivan County heard oral arguments in the suit Sept. 27 but has made no ruling.</p>
        <p>The longtime members, who remain in charge of the synagogue pending a court ruling, still say they welcome all Jews for services and prayer. They say, however, that not all who pray here are members, and membership is the crux of the case.</p>
        <p>The defendants contend that membership is a matter of religious law and that the court should not exercise jurisdiction. But Jack S. Ingber, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, said the matter was ''simply a question of membership'' governed by the state Religious Corporations Law.</p>
        <p>That statute provides that in the absence of specific rules -- and there is some dispute over whether those exist at the Swan Lake synagogue -- voting rights are accorded those who have been ''stated attendants on divine worship in such church and have regularly contributed to the financial support thereof'' for a year.</p>
        <p>Of course, the parties do not agree on what ''stated attendance'' means. The plaintiffs say it requires much more than praying at some services in the summer and putting money in the charity box. The defendants say the Hasidic vacationers are the most regular worshipers at the synagogue, which is closed in the winter.</p>
        <p>However the statute is interpreted, Schwartz v. Rosenberger reflects a cultural divide in Judaism as much as a battle over one synagogue. The grandchildren of the Zionists and labor-union Socialists who once flocked to the Catskills are more likely to spend Saturday at Shea Stadium than at synagogue, and wince as the old neighborhood starts to resemble a century-old shtetl.</p>
        <p>In Swan Lake, many who once vacationed here have joined longtime residents as homeowners and say the thousands of Hasidic summer people are responsible for intolerable traffic and crowds in the village.</p>
        <p>Norman Turetsky, Mr. Schwartz's predecessor as the synagogue president, talked about his roots here as much as he talked about issues of membership, voting and statutes.</p>
        <p>Standing in front of the synagogue, Mr. Turetsky pointed down the street. ''My father's house was over there,'' he said. ''I went to school here,'' he continued, indicating the abandoned public school over his shoulder, ''and this was my shul,'' or synagogue.</p>
        <p>There is still some hope that Judaism can provide a big tent here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz is straining to reassure longtime congregants and negotiate a settlement. Rabbi Einhorn, himself Hasidic, said, ''I'm going to fight with a quiet heart,'' but added that ''no one should push the people who have been here for years.''</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of embarrassment here on both ends,'' Rabbi Einhorn said.</p>
        <p>There are efforts to heal the breach, but bad feelings linger.</p>
        <p>After the court hearing, which was just before Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, Mr. Liblick joined several synagogue officers on the front lawn and paused at the message board, where someone had removed the rabbi's name. As he pointed, Shia Grunwald, a defendant in the suit, approached and accused him of throwing prayer books on the floor. Mr. Liblick started to argue with Mr. Grunwald and then to shout at him.</p>
        <p>As they wound down, the two men challenged each other to practice tolerance. In an apparent stab at it, Mr. Grunwald said Mr. Liblick ''is the second-best guy in the world -- behind me.'' They shook hands and exchanged wishes for a happy New Year.</p>
