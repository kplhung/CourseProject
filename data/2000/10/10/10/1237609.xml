        <p>This has been the biggest year in the career of the far-reaching jam-rock band Phish. The group held the largest New Year's Eve concert in the world with a show in the Everglades that attracted 80,000 people. It became the subject of a documentary feature, a tribute album and two books. Phish flabbergasted its fans by performing twice in an unlikely collaboration with the rap-metal star Kid Rock. It was on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, a rarity for a band with little exposure on commercial radio or MTV. And on Saturday, it broke up.</p>
        <p>Phish has not broken up for good, the band's management says. But it is breaking up for a while, leaving a gaping hole in the lives of the thousands of fans who follow the band from city to city. No concerts are booked, no albums are scheduled, and band members plan to go their separate ways. ''The plan,'' said the group's spokeswoman, ''is that there is no plan.''</p>
        <p>Unlike such classic-rockers as the Who, who ensure maximum ticket sales for concerts by breaking up with a bang and then mounting a noisy reunion, Phish -- one of the most important and consistently successful touring rock bands of its generation -- disappeared quietly. It declared a moratorium on interviews; it didn't take out any advertisements for its final concert or plan anything special. And local newspapers hardly even mentioned that this seminal moment in the lives of Phish fans was taking place in their town.</p>
        <p>Such a low-profile goodbye was a surprise coming from a group that loves sweating over big special events, from its annual New Year's Eve shows, to its sleep-over summer festivals for tens of thousands of fans, to the Halloween concerts at which the band covers entire albums like ''Quadrophenia'' by the Who.</p>
        <p>Intent on leaving quietly, members of Phish declined to comment on the temporary breakup. But John Paluska, the band's manager, said the reason for the hiatus was that ''everybody just hit an undefinable point of exhaustion at the same time'' and wanted to be with their families, especially after a year in which the band hit a new peak of popularity.</p>
        <p>''Everyone likes to see people step aside when they're at the top of their game instead of dragging it out until they're finished up,'' he said. ''It's the old idea of leaving them wanting more.''</p>
        <p>The band's final concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater here on Saturday certainly accomplished that: fans expected a third set of music or special guests (Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead had emerged on stage the previous night) or even a comment from the band. But fans got no extras -- not even a single word. Outside of the concert's being an extremely tight, strong and solid two sets from a band that plays every concert differently, there was no palpable feeling of an ending -- or even a break -- in the performance. The only sign that something unusual was happening was when Phish's road crew emerged after the two-and-a-half hour show to a standing ovation and a recording of ''Let It Be'' by the Beatles.</p>
        <p>As a nod to devoted fans, Phish did string the set with a high number of favorite jams, including ''Mike's Song,'' ''Bathtub Gin,'' ''Tweezer,'' ''David Bowie'' and ''You Enjoy Myself.'' Remarkable for its ability to  play, blend and re-arrange any style of music, from heavy metal to barbershop quartet to 12-tone serialism, Phish proved itself once again with versions of ''My Soul'' by the zydeco king Clifton Chenier and a numbingly beautiful progressive-rock jam centered on ''Also Sprach Zarathustra).'' But even without a clear goodbye, the whole story could be read in the faces of some of the Phish fans wandering lost around the concert grounds and parking lot. ''There are going to be a lot of people out here tonight bawling their eyes out, and I'm with a few of them,'' said Stephen Williams, a 25-year-old from Vermont who has seen 108 Phish shows.</p>
        <p>Like the band, many fans were also looking forward to the vacation. Some said it would even save marriages and jobs, but most said it would give them an opportunity to see newer bands. Mr. Williams said he would be hunting for a band that is ''like Phish when they were young and playing in small places where there was no hassle to get tickets.''</p>
        <p>The band that seems most likely to benefit from Phish's absence is the String Cheese Incident, a seven-year-old Colorado band with roots in bluegrass, Southern rock and exploratory jamming. Several fans said  they planned to follow the group in Phish's absence, and attend the String Cheese Incident's New Year's Eve show in Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>''I think that this is a great thing for the fans, who could certainly use a break,'' said Richard Gehr, who wrote ''The Phish Book'' with the group. ''Phish fans tend to be myopic about the band and they don't realize there are at least a dozen other improv rock bands out there that they should check out, such as the Disco Biscuits and Fat Mama, to name a couple of my favorites. I also think on some level Phish did realize that they had taken it as far as they could for the time being. They're really smart guys, and the last thing they want to do is wear out their welcome or become a cliche like the Grateful Dead, who ended up just touring to support the institution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Paluska said that taking the break was a gamble. ''There's the gnawing fear that we'll lose all the momentum we built. But unless we take an inordinate amount of time off, I don't think that anyone's going to go anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Some Phish fans, like Craig Raskin, a 30-year-old electrician from New Jersey, said they would wait for Phish no matter what. ''I've got another 40 years to live,'' he said, adding that even if it took Phish 20 years to come back, he would be there. Then again, he added, after the San Francisco show, ''I don't need a break. I could see a show tomorrow. I could use one right now.''</p>
        <p>Of course, anything can happen in the lives of fans. They could easily find themselves pulled into the community around another band. Similarly, anything could happen to the members of Phish in their time off. It seems most likely that the band will be gone for at least a year, but fans haven't ruled anything out, from a shorter break to the extremely unlikely chance of a permanent one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paluska said that fans would probably see a different type of Phish when it does return. ''They realized that not only do they want to take this break,'' he said of the band's members, ''but to re-envision their careers in a way that's consistent with being family men.'' (Two in the group, Trey Anastasio and Page McConnell, have children.)</p>
        <p>Between the band's tours and its special annual shows, it has no free time, he added. ''It starts to feel formulaic for us after a while -- and their whole thing has been to make every event special,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for his own thoughts on the temporary breakup, Mr. Paluska said: ''I'm ecstatic. I've been advocating for this for three years.''</p>
