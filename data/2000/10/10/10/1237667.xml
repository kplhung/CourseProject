        <p>When Djordje Radulovic took a job as a research associate at an Internet start-up in May, he never thought he would fulfill his daydream of becoming a professional money manager, and certainly not by the beginning of the fall. But earlier this month, Mr. Radulovic, a 25-year-old employing a bargain-hunting investing style made famous by Warren E. Buffett, started his own investment fund.</p>
        <p>It is called the Djordje Radulovic Space-Age Defense Fund -- Mr. Radulovic's stock picks include Northrop Grumman and Raytheon -- and it is one of 11 new investment portfolios being offered by his employer, Maxfunds.com, a privately held Ann Arbor, Mich., start-up that is one of six companies aiming to give individual investors a shot at managing money.</p>
        <p>Certainly, inexperienced managers have run mutual funds before, and Mr. Radulovic is not unfamiliar with finance -- he has a master's degree in economics from Central Michigan University. But the mutual fund industry grooms recruits as stock analysts before they are given a public fund and generally supports its managers with research, analysts and managers, as well as direct contact with corporate executives. Mr. Radulovic does his research on the Internet, by himself.</p>
        <p>This begs a question. Why would anyone want a money manager without that Wall Street pedigree?</p>
        <p>''I see it as a benefit because there are a lot of people out there who follow the market and have great ideas,'' said Mr. Radulovic, who hopes to be able to outgun the $33.7 million Fidelity Select Defense and Aerospace fund, his closest conceivable competitor.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, it is easy to find critics of the idea of turning to untrained newcomers for investment advice -- many find the notion a hangover from last year's happy-go-lucky bull market.</p>
        <p>Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund industry consultant, called the approach a ''lottery'' and said there were no guarantees that amateur investors could maintain stellar short-term performance gains.</p>
        <p>''I think all of these are creatures that are popping up at the tail end of the greatest bull market in history,'' he said. ''There is just a great deal of ego and chutzpah, for want of a better expression, on the part of people who would invest in and be captivated by this approach.''</p>
        <p>But a half-dozen companies have sprung up in the last year and a half peddling the idea, and it has attracted the backing of some of the mutual fund industry's innovators.</p>
        <p>Hiring relatively inexperienced people to run mutual funds is only one approach being tried by a handful of new power-to-the-people investment companies. Another seeks to try to tame the maelstrom of the market by taking investment advice from a community of voices with all ranges of experience. Four companies have taken up this approach, known as collective intelligence.</p>
        <p>StockJungle.com, a small Los Angeles firm, opened the StockJungle.com Community Intelligence fund last November. The fund tracks the portfolios of volunteer stock pickers who visit its Web site, then the fund's managers cherry-pick ideas from the site's community and do further research before making a final decision. They also use the community to find larger investing trends.</p>
        <p>Why would anyone bother to share their stock picks on a Web site? Michael White, StockJungle.com's head of marketing, believes people who come to the site enjoy the competitive game of outdueling other investors and also feel compelled to share. The community's stock picks and track record are posted on the Web site, for anyone to use.</p>
        <p>''There is an ethic on the Internet -- if I take value, I'm going to give back value,'' he said. ''It's almost like Napster in a way. It's a lending library of investment portfolios.''</p>
        <p>He also said the company's tracking mechanisms, which record a user's buy and sell recommendations, expose people trying to promote what they know are worthless stocks or otherwise manipulate the market.</p>
        <p>The StockJungle.com fund, which has gained 23.4 percent this year, is one of the year's top 10 large-company growth funds, according to Morningstar, a fund-tracking firm. But the $7 million StockJungle.com fund is so new that it is hard to tell whether its track record is more than a fluke.</p>
        <p>Several firms are picking up the baton. The newest is WeVest, of Berkeley, Calif., which has as its vice chairman Tom Seip, a former Charles Schwab executive who was the architect of the company's groundbreaking One Source mutual fund supermarket.</p>
        <p>WeVest's Web site says that the firm is planning a series of ''collaborative'' funds that appear somewhat similar to StockJungle.com's, but will use a more quantitative approach, with sophisticated computer screens culling suggestions from as many contributors as they can muster.</p>
        <p>''Coming from Charles Schwab, you have a very strong belief in the individual investor and the wisdom of the individual investor,'' Mr. Seip said. ''The collective wisdom of the individual investor, as an idea, ought to be even more powerful.''</p>
        <p>Two other firms, MutualMinds.com of Dallas and IPS Advisory of Knoxville, Tenn., have already filed registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission for collaborative mutual funds of their own.</p>
        <p>''The market is this superior entity that may not have a physical body, a will or an agenda, but it knows things before people know them,'' said Robert A. Loest, a fund manager and the chief executive of IPS Advisory. Mr. Loest said his planned IPS iFund, which will take its stock picks from a community of investors, is ''kind of like the market in miniature.''</p>
        <p>''We're hopeful we'll see an emergent intelligence,'' he added, likening the approach to the wisdom of a bee hive over a lone bee. ''The hive operates at a high level of intelligence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The other approach, the one preferred by Mr. Radulovic's employer, is focused on giving individuals outside of the mutual fund industry a chance to manage money. Looking beyond Wall Street has had some success before. Until recently, the $4 billion Firsthand Technology Value fund stood as the best performing mutual fund in any category over the last five years. The fund was run by Kendrick W. Kam and Kevin Landis, who had been executives at technology and health care companies before starting an investment club and then deciding to try their hand at managing a mutual fund.</p>
        <p>''Firsthand proved you didn't need to be a Wall Street pro to be a good investor,'' said Mr. Kam, who co-founded Novoste Inc., a medical device manufacturer in the 1980's. He left Firsthand earlier this year to start Marketocracy, a Los Altos, Calif., firm. Since the company's Web site went up in July, Mr. Kam said he had enlisted 14,000 people to set up mock portfolios. He plans to track these portfolios for three years and then start a family of mutual funds run by the winners.</p>
        <p>So what if one of the winners is, say, a 14-year-old kid?</p>
        <p>''Well, then, it's a 14-year-old kid with the best three-year track record in the world,'' Mr. Kam said. ''As a mutual fund shareholder, do you care if he's 14 if he delivers performance? As long as it's legal.''</p>
        <p>Every mutual fund has to be reviewed and approved by the S.E.C. StockJungle.com's fund has already passed muster with the commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Radulovic's employer, Maxfunds.com, is the most unconventional of any of these companies. It has created what it calls ''synthetic funds,'' stock recommendations offered in conjuction with a new investment product called folios -- baskets of stock sold at a volume discount. Folios are seen as an alternative to mutual funds that allow investors to buy stocks directly. Maxfunds.com's service is aimed at investors who use folios but also want the kind of advice they would get from a mutual fund manager.</p>
        <p>Initially, the service is free, but eventually Maxfunds.com and managers such as Mr. Radulovic will split monthly fees charged for their fund management services. To start, Maxfunds.com has enlisted the publisher of a technology newsletter, a small investment adviser and Mr. Radulovic to run portfolios. It also has devised several unusual index portfolios, including one that tracks the largest public companies in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''There are too many of the same old mutual funds and not enough unique and interesting ideas,'' wrote James J. Atkinson, president of Maxfunds.com, in an essay on the company's Web site. ''The mutual fund industry usually comes to the party late, often after the stocks have already moved upward.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Radulovic, a native of Belgrade, Yugoslavia, who moved to Michigan when he was in the third grade, Maxfunds.com's new funds are ''incredible news.''</p>
        <p>''I got really excited when I first heard about it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Radulovic, whose day job is monitoring Maxfunds.com's database of mutual funds and synthetic funds, has an unusual investing approach for a 25-year-old, certainly not a style one might expect from a member of the freewheeling Internet generation.</p>
        <p>He is a value investor who searches for bargain stocks that have fallen out of favor, in hopes of riding a rebound. In the last few years, value investing itself has fallen out of favor. This year, though, it has been resuscitated by a broad slump that has punctured the bull market.</p>
        <p>In college, Mr. Radulovic invested in a real estate mutual fund and a European stock fund. Last year, he mostly avoided Internet stocks and, as he called it, the ''tech craze.'' This year he has bought two battered blue chips, the AT&amp;T Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. Both, he said, are good companies whose stock prices have fallen to unreasonably low levels.</p>
        <p>He sees military industry stocks as having been undervalued in the past. The sector has revived this year.</p>
        <p>Of his competitor, the Fidelity fund, he said, ''it's not a true defense fund,'' noting that one of its top holdings was B. F. Goodrich. Though the company was known for its tires, it now manufactures aerospace components like landing gear and cockpit instrumentation. Mr. Radulovic acknowledged that he did not have the facilities of Fidelity, the Boston mutual fund giant that manages $1 trillion.</p>
        <p>''I don't have the resources or capability to go out and meet management,'' he said, adding that he did most of his research on DowJones.com and Hoovers.com, which he uses for corporate profiles and S.E.C. filings.</p>
        <p>But he will be judged against Fidelity and other fund companies. Maxfunds.com intends to track all of its synthetic funds and compare them against traditional mutual funds, like Fidelity's military fund.</p>
        <p>''The goal is clearly to beat the performance of that one, but I'd like to be able to have a return of at least 20 percent,'' Mr. Radulovic said. ''Otherwise it's not worth it. Why not just get an S.&amp; P. 500 index fund?''</p>
