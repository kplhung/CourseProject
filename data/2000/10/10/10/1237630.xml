        <p>The clashes in Israel and Palestine, combined with the kidnapping by Hezbollah of three Israeli soldiers on Lebanese-Syrian land, need not plunge the Middle East into new warfare. If the Israelis learn the lessons of the current conflict, this crisis could propel Arabs and Israelis back toward negotiations with a better understanding of what it will take to build a peace.</p>
        <p>This is a watershed moment because Israel's quest for acceptance and security in its region is threatened in all three of the areas where Arabs and Israelis interact: A virtual civil war has erupted among some Jewish and Arab Israelis within Israel; the Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank, Arab East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip have erupted in yet another revolt for freedom and dignity; and Israel's search for normality with its Arab neighbors is revealed more than ever as fragile and erratic, as evidenced by the Lebanon kidnappings and strong anti-Israeli sentiment in Jordan and Egypt.</p>

        <p>The clashes in Israel and Palestine, combined with the kidnapping by Hezbollah of three Israeli soldiers on Lebanese-Syrian land, need not plunge the Middle East into new warfare. If the Israelis learn the lessons of the current conflict, this crisis could propel Arabs and Israelis back toward negotiations with a better understanding of what it will take to build a peace.</p>
        <p>This is a watershed moment because Israel's quest for acceptance and security in its region is threatened in all three of the areas where Arabs and Israelis interact: A virtual civil war has erupted among some Jewish and Arab Israelis within Israel; the Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank, Arab East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip have erupted in yet another revolt for freedom and dignity; and Israel's search for normality with its Arab neighbors is revealed more than ever as fragile and erratic, as evidenced by the Lebanon kidnappings and strong anti-Israeli sentiment in Jordan and Egypt.</p>
        <p>From the Arab perspective, this is a crisis of Israel's own making, and the way out of it may rest primarily in the policy options that Israel chooses in the coming weeks and months. Its choices in the past 12 days have proved disastrous.</p>
        <p>The visit to the Haram al-Sharif by Ariel Sharon on Sept. 28 was taken by all Arabs and Muslims as a direct, predatory Israeli threat to the most powerful religious and nationalist symbols in Arab Palestine: the Al Aksa and Dome of the Rock mosques. The ensuing Israeli military actions against mostly unarmed Palestinian youngsters exposed Palestinian vulnerability, Israeli excesses and the weaknesses of the Oslo peace accords. And this week Israeli settlers and civilians have carried out vigilante killings and terror sprees leading to Palestinian deaths and destruction of Palestinian property in the West Bank and Gaza and also in towns in Israel like Nazareth. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's use of ultimatums has only added to the pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli sentiment throughout the Arab world.</p>
        <p>Historically, Israel enjoyed peace and stability when it stopped occupying Arab lands and instead applied standards of moral equity and international legality to its relations with its Arab neighbors. The Egyptian and Jordanian peace accords have held because Israel, Egypt and Jordan all enjoyed equal sovereign rights. Peace has reigned along the Lebanese border since Israel withdrew from most of southern Lebanon. And Israeli-Palestinian calm reigned while the Oslo process was bringing tangible gains to both sides.</p>
        <p>Conversely, where Israel continues to occupy Arab lands and act with colonial swagger, resistance persists. It is a lesson as old as history itself, exemplified in the experience of the ancient Hebrews' own legitimate quest for liberty, life, and national self-affirmation: An equitable negotiated peace is preferable to political provocations, long-term occupations and chronic military overkill.</p>
        <p>The way out of these recurring crises is to complete the peace talks, but this time on the basis of equal national rights for Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
