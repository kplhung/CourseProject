        <p>The first game of the post-Patrick Ewing era will take place Tuesday night at 7:30 when the Knicks play host to the Chicago Bulls in an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Last month's trade of Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics turned the Knicks into a perimeter-dominated team featuring the high-scoring swingmen Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston and Glen Rice, but fans are not likely to see the three working in unison just yet.</p>
        <p>Houston sustained a mild sprain of his left ankle on Saturday and has not gone through a full practice since. He said he hoped to play Tuesday, but the Knicks have listed him as day to day. If Houston does compete, he may play only sparingly. Rice tweaked his right ankle on Sunday but is expected to play against the Bulls.</p>
        <p>Even the Knicks do not know how well their three perimeter stars can mesh. Houston sat out the bulk of the first three days of practice before injuring his ankle in his third practice, so Coach Jeff Van Gundy has not had much opportunity to put Sprewell, Houston and Rice on the court together. If Houston does not play, Rice, who thus far has been designated as the sixth man, will most likely start along with Sprewell, Charlie Ward, Larry Johnson and Marcus Camby.</p>
