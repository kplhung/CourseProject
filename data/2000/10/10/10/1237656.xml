        <p>Vinny Testaverde received a cortisone shot in his neck today to help relieve the inflammation around the pinched nerve that knocked him out of Sunday's 20-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers after one play. Then he was sent home early -- before the offensive meetings were over -- after he experienced discomfort at the point of the injection.</p>
        <p>Cortisone shots are not an unusual treatment, but Testaverde, who is almost always available on Monday to discuss Sunday's game, did not meet with reporters today. The Jets, who typically erect a stone wall around information concerning injuries, provided no insight into Testaverde's long-term prognosis or his availability for next Sunday's game at New England.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh said he had not spoken to Testaverde by the time he met with reporters this afternoon. And he said he has never inquired about and does not know what kind of treatment Testaverde has been receiving since he first sustained the injury against the Patriots on Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>''You know my attitude about going into detail on injuries because I think they create built-in excuses,'' Groh said. ''I don't think there is going to be an instant clear up to it. He's a terrific player, and an integral part of what we do. Certainly I have concern about the final outcome. I think the status is that we'll get out to practice on Wednesday and see how well he can throw the ball.''</p>
        <p>Groh said that he hoped to know by  Wednesday -- when the Jets begin preparation for New England -- whether Testaverde or the backup Ray Lucas would start. But he said that he probably won't announce the decision until just before the game. Testaverde had said Sunday that he would have tests today, but Groh said that Testaverde did not have tests today -- ''not that has been reported to me.''</p>
        <p>Although the Jets did not reveal Testaverde's existing injury until it flared up Sunday and knocked him out of the game, they are not subject to a fine by the National Football League. A league official called the Jets today and was told that Testaverde had not missed a practice all season and that there had never been any doubt that he would play in any of the three games he appeared in since the injury, meaning the Jets did not have to put Testaverde on their injury report.</p>
        <p>The only certainty about the situation is that Lucas, who was 6-3 as a starter last season, will probably take at least half the snaps during practice this week.</p>
        <p>The Jets' package of offensive plays will probably remain the same, though it will be altered to take advantage of Lucas's mobility, with more roll-outs and play action. Groh would not say whether the rookie Chad Pennington would get repetitions as well.</p>
        <p>The Jets and Lucas hope the additional work will relieve the anxiety he felt when he replaced Testaverde. Lucas said his adrenaline and his shock that Testaverde had been knocked out so quickly led him to overthrow balls. Lucas passed for just 99 yards, was intercepted twice and fumbled once.</p>
        <p>''I can't play any worse,'' Lucas said today. ''I looked in the mirror yesterday and I was like, 'You stink.' You look in the mirror and you think to yourself: 'Is there anything I could have done better? Everything.' ''</p>
        <p>Referring to the offensive coordinator, Dan Henning, Lucas said, ''As Dan Henning said upstairs, there was an imposter impersonating Ray Lucas on Sunday.''</p>
        <p>Groh said he was just as disappointed in Lucas's play as Lucas was and his unhappiness with the game in general was apparent. ''Still stinks,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>But Groh said he has a great deal of confidence in Lucas after his solid performance in relief of Testaverde last season, although he bristled at the notion that the suddenness of Testaverde's injury and the speed with which Lucas had to enter the game affected Lucas's performance.</p>
        <p>''It better not,'' Groh said. ''That's the role of the backup quarterback, to play at a moment's notice. We had a four-day practice week because we had a bye, and Ray got more turns last week than is normally the case.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>RAY LUCAS said he apologized to WAYNE CHREBET after the loss. Lucas threw to Chrebet 12 times and Chrebet caught four. One pass intended for Chrebet sailed over his head and was intercepted. Chrebet threw his arms in the air in apparent frustration after a few of Lucas's passes. Chrebet did not talk to reporters after the game or today to explain his actions. But Lucas did not take offense at Chrebet's show of emotion. ''I'm not mad at him,'' Lucas said. ''I didn't get the ball to him. If somebody drops one of my balls, you'll see me throwing my arms in the air. He wants the ball. He wants to win.''</p>
