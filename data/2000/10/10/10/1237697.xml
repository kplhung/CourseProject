        <p>Did He Step-Dance Under the Table?</p>
        <p>The Irish pop singer BRIAN KENNEDY, a star of ''Riverdance on Broadway,'' discovered the other night that PRESIDENT CLINTON likes to sing along.</p>
        <p>At a fund-raiser at the Manhattan apartment of the songwriter DENISE RICH, Mr. Kennedy sang ''Carrickfergus,'' a ballad about longing and loss. The president started mouthing the words during the second verse, he said.</p>
        <p>''There's not that many people that know that song verse for verse,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''It was funny looking down at that table and seeing DONALD J. TRUMP and these other people, one big long table, and him singing along. The words are not easy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy also had news from Belfast, where Mr. Clinton heard him sing with VAN MORRISON in 1996. ''When he came up the Falls Road to a wee family bakery, he accepted a gift of some bread,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''They now call the bakery Clinton's. When I told him that, he busted out laughing and said, 'I can't wait to tell Hillary.' ''</p>
        <p>This could be confusing.  Family things often are.</p>
        <p>There were four generations of Gores and two generations of Gore in-laws at a party at the West Village loft of the artist JENNIFER BARTLETT the other night. By the time VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE and TIPPER GORE arrived from Florida, their daughter, KARENNA GORE SCHIFF, and her 15-month-old son, WYATT, had cruised through the living room, the terrace and the white-walled studio downstairs. Mrs. Schiff's husband, DREW, was there, too, as were his parents, DAVID and LISA SCHIFF; his sister ASHLEY; and his brother SCOTT. So was Mr. Gore's mother, PAULINE LAFON. It was her 88th birthday.</p>
        <p>Wyatt stole the show, rolling, clapping, gurgling and toddling his way through Mr. Gore's talk. Karenna Gore Schiff tried to distract him with a book. Wyatt would not be distracted, but the vice president was only too happy to let himself be.</p>
        <p>At one point, he turned to the little boy and said, ''Wyatt, would you like to show these people how you can walk backwards?'' After a bit of coaxing and coaching by Mr. Gore -- and some neck-craning in a crowd that included the artist CHUCK CLOSE, the singers BARBARA COOK and MARY CLEERE HARAN and the society pianist BOBBY SHORT -- Wyatt complied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore went back to talking about the things presidential candidates talk about, only to stop and say, ''I would rather hear him speak, even if it's only 'Mama.' ''</p>
        <p>Outside, two women passing by were impressed that the vice president was in the neighborhood. ''We love him,'' one declared. The other said they liked him in the debate last week, but ''we think he wears too much blush, and he should not orchestrate the facial expressions.''</p>
        <p>Some Questions About a Film</p>
        <p>GLENN CLOSE found herself fielding questions about FARRAH FAWCETT at a screening of the made-for-cable-television film ''Baby'' the other night. For example: why cast Ms. Fawcett in the lead? ''She has lived life a lot and has a lot of passion,'' said Ms. Close, who was an executive producer of ''Baby.''</p>
        <p>A few steps away at the Sutton Theater on East 57th Street, Ms. Fawcett was asking reporter-like questions of an executive from the cable channel TNT.</p>
        <p>How many people would tune in? Approximately 25 million to 26 million, the executive said. Nightly? No, over the eight-night run, which began on Sunday and ends Oct. 22.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fawcett said she had commuted between an island off Nova Scotia, where ''Baby'' was filmed, and Dallas, where the Robert Altman film ''Dr. T. and the Women'' was being made at the same time.</p>
        <p>Ms. Close recently finished another project, ''South Pacific,'' for HBO. ''I needed to find actors who could sing,'' she said, and began singing ''Some Enchanted Evening.''</p>
        <p>A woman with an English accent joined the conversation, saying she had a special interest because she ''was married to a rock star.''</p>
        <p>The woman moved on. Who was that? someone asked. ''I have no idea,'' Ms. Close said, laughing. It turned out that the woman was ANN DEXTER-JONES. Her husband is MICK JONES, the lead guitarist in the band Foreigner.</p>
        <p>E. B. Whatever</p>
        <p>On Sunday, after sitting through the debate between HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON and RICK A. LAZIO, GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI questioned Mrs. Clinton's reference to the author and essayist E. B. White. ''Wyatt or somebody,'' Mr. Pataki called him, adding, a moment later, ''I don't know who that guy was.''</p>
        <p>So yesterday the question was: Are you familiar with E. B. White?</p>
        <p>''Ah, yes, yes,'' MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI said. ''He's a very fine third baseman.''</p>
        <p>The mayor was kidding. ''Come on, we're making a big deal out of nothing,'' he said. ''I think the point the governor was making is a very, very valid one. And that is, you don't need to rely on somebody else's quotation about the state of New York or the city of New York in order to describe it if you come from here.''</p>
