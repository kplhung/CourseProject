      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial holds Pres Clinton is right to try to end Israeli-Palestinian clashes, holding they threaten Israeli security, could cost Palestinians dignity, statehood and international aid they were close to attaining and threaten Mideast peace; holds administration was right to abstain on one-sided but meaningless Security Council resolution to preserve its ability to negotiate with all sides; urges Yasir Arafat to curb fighting and inflatmatory statements by Palestinians</p>

        <p>President Clinton has spent the better part of the past week trying to quell the violence in the Middle East, and has offered to travel to the region to meet with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Mr. Clinton's instincts are right. If the bloodshed continues, years of peace diplomacy will very likely collapse, with potentially severe consequences for the entire region and for American security interests.</p>
        <p>Americans should be under no illusions about the possible ramifications of the unrest that began 13 days ago and has taken more than 80 lives and left hundreds injured. It could deny Israelis the opportunity they deserve to live at peace with their neighbors and throw Israeli society into a state of perpetual violence and insecurity. It would deny Palestinians the dignity, statehood and international assistance they were recently so close to attaining. Renewed conflict would surely stunt the economic prospects of Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

        <p>President Clinton has spent the better part of the past week trying to quell the violence in the Middle East, and has offered to travel to the region to meet with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Mr. Clinton's instincts are right. If the bloodshed continues, years of peace diplomacy will very likely collapse, with potentially severe consequences for the entire region and for American security interests.</p>
        <p>Americans should be under no illusions about the possible ramifications of the unrest that began 13 days ago and has taken more than 80 lives and left hundreds injured. It could deny Israelis the opportunity they deserve to live at peace with their neighbors and throw Israeli society into a state of perpetual violence and insecurity. It would deny Palestinians the dignity, statehood and international assistance they were recently so close to attaining. Renewed conflict would surely stunt the economic prospects of Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The risks run well beyond Israel's borders. The abduction of three Israeli soldiers by Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas Saturday has ratcheted up tensions between Israel and Syria, and brought threats of cross-border air strikes. Anti-Israel rioting in Jordan and Egypt threatens to freeze or even unravel the peace both countries have made with Israel. Jordan, with its large Palestinian population, could face serious internal unrest. Such an environment of confrontation and instability would be custom-made for Saddam Hussein to exploit, and could tempt both Iraq and Iran to manipulate their oil exports for maximum political leverage in a tight international energy market.</p>
        <p>Given the possible consequences, the Clinton administration was right to abstain on a one-sided but meaningless Security Council resolution Saturday after winning agreement to water down its most offensive language. America's commitment to Israel is clear, but Washington must preserve its ability to negotiate with all sides.</p>
        <p>The Israeli anxieties that have led Mr. Barak to threaten to unleash full military force against Palestinian targets are readily understandable. The sight of Palestinians destroying Joseph's tomb, a Jewish holy site in Nablus, was chilling to Jews not only in Israel but around the world. That Palestinian police did nothing to stop the desecration a day before the beginning of Yom Kippur added to the affront. But Israel must be measured in its response to such provocations. Early this morning the cabinet wisely decided to extend its deadline for Mr. Arafat to end the violence. Mr. Barak should prohibit the use of deadly force except where absolutely necessary to protect Israeli lives. He should also put aside the idea of inviting the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, into a national unity coalition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat must do what he has conspicuously failed to do for the past 13 days. He must ensure that his police actively restrain Palestinians seeking confrontation with Israelis and withdraw the paramilitary forces he controls from the fighting. He must also see to it that all those associated with him halt inflammatory statements and calls for war against Israel. He should also publicly call on Hezbollah to release the three abducted Israeli soldiers.</p>
        <p>A particularly alarming development has been the communal clashes that have erupted in recent nights not just in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip but between Israeli Arabs and Jews in towns like Nazareth. Mr. Barak and other Israeli leaders rightly called on their people yesterday to step back from such confrontations. Palestinian leaders must now do the same if there is to be any chance of keeping the upheaval from escalating beyond the point where peace can be restored.</p>
