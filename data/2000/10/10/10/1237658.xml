        <p>Relaxing in Seattle and waiting to see whom the Mariners would play in the American League Championship Series, Alex Rodriguez left Derek Jeter a humorous telephone message about surviving and thriving on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez told Jeter that the Yankees might as well go ahead and beat the Athletics in Game 5 of their division series that night. You see, Rodriguez said in mock serious tones, the Mariners had problems handling the A's this season, so they would not weep if the Yankees ejected them.</p>
        <p>Jeter was holding a bottle of Champagne in his left hand and he put his right hand over his mouth to hide a smile when he recalled Rodriguez's message in a soggy clubhouse at Oakland. Obviously, Rodriguez was tweaking Jeter while reminding him that the Mariners were waiting. Now the Yankees have advanced, so Jeter can return the call.</p>
        <p>''He'll probably call me first,'' Jeter said.</p>
        <p>Get ready for shortstop overload starting tonight in New York. Derek and Alex, A-Rod and D. J., and on and on. The series is about two teams that dislike each other and that skirmished in a fascinating division series in 1995, but the most compelling players' feature will be Rodriguez versus Jeter.</p>
        <p>Every time Jeter or Rodriguez reaches second base, the television cameras will follow the two of them. Did Rodriguez whisper to Jeter? Did Jeter wink? Quick, switch to a split screen with Jeter hovering behind Rodriguez as he leads off second. Someone call Chad Curtis to ask about his criticism of Jeter for chatting with Rodriguez during a brawl last season. Jeter and Rodriguez are the most popular players on two powerful teams and they just happen to be best friends, too. Cue the inspirational music.</p>
        <p>''At this point,'' Rodriguez has said, ''Derek has become like my brother.''</p>
        <p>Ask Jeter about the personal duel with a friend who has likened him to a brother, and watch him dance. Jeter does not want this to be about Jeter versus Rodriguez, but it will be. As close as Jeter is with Rodriguez, staying in his home in Seattle when the Yankees play there and hanging out on his 45-foot boat in Florida in the off-season, Jeter was cautious, too cautious, about discussing the friendship. Jeter does not want the A.L.C.S. to be treated like some sort of personal duel. Too late.</p>
        <p>''It'll be fun to play them because they have an exciting team and they've been our rivals since 1995,'' Jeter said. ''I don't think about it as me playing against him because we've got to face the whole team. It'd be different if he was pitching to me or I was pitching to him. But I'm not playing against him.''</p>
        <p>So what? There are games within the game and, even if Rodriguez and Jeter are not throwing fastballs to each other, there is still something special about comparing them. Rodriguez is a free-agent-to-be who hit .314 with 41 homers and 132 runs batted in, while Jeter is the forever Yankee who hit .339 with 15 homers and 73 R.B.I.</p>
        <p>Jeter has three World Series rings, while Rodriguez could soon have a $20 million-a-year contract, perhaps even with the Mets. The first thing Jeter does every morning is scour the box scores to see how Rodriguez did. The first thing Rodriguez seemingly does each November is hear about Jeter's latest ring. It will be entertaining to watch two shortstops who try to keep up with each other in the Cooperstown chase also compete for a spot in the World Series.</p>
        <p>''We want to kill each other,'' Rodriguez has said. ''I think we both drive each other and motivate each other. But when we're off the field, we're like family.''</p>
        <p>Jeter has said, ''We're close, but he knows I want to beat his team as much as any other team.''</p>
        <p>Fifty years ago, Phil Rizzuto never slept on Pee Wee Reese's couch. But, while Rizzuto admitted that he ''has a few spike marks'' from Reese's slides, he always considered him a friend.</p>
        <p>''We weren't enemies then,'' Rizzuto said. ''We wanted to beat each other's brains in. But when the game was over, you'd have a bite to eat. We would have a lollipop and say we were better.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles Jeter, Derek's father and a former college shortstop, said: ''My feeling has always been that you could be intense competitors on the field and friends off it. That's part of the fun. You beat your friends and then you get bragging rights.''</p>
        <p>As reticent as Jeter was about playing down any individual matchups, they help make the postseason so appealing. As a 22-year-old rookie, Jeter outplayed Cal Ripken by hitting .417 to Ripken's .250 in the 1996 A.L.C.S. Ripken moved to third base the next year, while the Yankees have won three of the last four World Series titles.</p>
        <p>Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra went head to head in last year's A.L.C.S., with Garciaparra outhitting Jeter, .400 to .350, but Jeter showed more style on defense and had the only homer between them, and the Yankees prevailed. Now we get to see Alex and Derek, two multimillionaires who became friends when Rodriguez called Jeter for advice about the amateur draft seven years ago.</p>
        <p>This week, Rodriguez jokingly advised Jeter and the two-time defending champions to vanquish the A's to help the Mariners. The two can continue teasing each other, but there is no need to trade phone messages anymore. They can save on the long-distance charges and talk near second base as the A.L.C.S. is contested.</p>
        <p>''He's always talking about how he wants to get the opportunity to be where we have been,'' Jeter said. ''But it's not a situation where we sit around and say that we wanted to play against each other.''</p>
        <p>Now it is happening. Enjoy it, brother.</p>
