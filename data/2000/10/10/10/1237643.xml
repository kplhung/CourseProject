        <p>WITH a second chance for a Subway Series, maybe the Yankees and the Mets will get it right this time. And if they get there together, it may be because of those who are no longer in the cast as much as for those who are.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did their duty a year ago, eliminating the Boston Red Sox in a quick five games in the American League Championship Series en route to their World Series sweep of the Atlanta Braves, who won the National League pennant when the Mets left-hander Kenny Rogers walked in the winning run.</p>
        <p>This time neither the Braves nor Kenny Rogers are around, so the Mets don't have an excuse in the N.L.C.S. that opens tomorrow night in St. Louis with Mark McGwire a mere pinch-hitter because of a sore knee.</p>
        <p>By then, the Yankees will have played twice in the A.L.C.S., which begins tonight at Yankee Stadium against the Mariners, their 1995 tormentors in a classic division series when Ken Griffey Jr. and Randy Johnson were more popular in Seattle than coffee or grilled salmon.</p>
        <p>Griffey hit five home runs in that series, including the eighth-inning blast off a weary David Cone that sparked the Mariners' eventual 11-inning 6-5 victory in the decisive fifth game. Griffey scored the winning run with a wild dash from first base on Edgar Martinez's two-run double.</p>
        <p>That run not only eliminated the Yankees in Don Mattingly's last season, but it also knocked Buck Showalter out of a job as their manager.</p>
        <p>''Not in my wildest dreams,'' Joe Torre was saying yesterday, ''did I imagine I was going to be the Yankees manager the following spring.''</p>
        <p>In winning three of the last four World Series, Torre has always been able to schedule his starters from strength. But tonight he will be forced to use Denny Neagle, the left-hander he didn't trust to start during the division series with Oakland; he preferred to go with both Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte on only three days' rest.</p>
        <p>Neagle claims he didn't feel snubbed. ''Not at all,'' he said, explaining that he was similarly sidetracked with the Braves.</p>
        <p>But feeling snubbed can be motivating, as it apparently was for Chuck Knoblauch, benched following the opening-game loss in Oakland.</p>
        <p>No longer either the designated hitter or the second baseman, Knoblauch didn't take ground balls before Saturday's 11-1 loss to Oakland and then popped off to The Hartford Courant that ''they don't have anything for me to do'' and if he were not on the A.L.C.S. roster, ''I'm not sticking around.''</p>
        <p>Alerted to Knoblauch's absence during the pregame routine, Torre confronted him.</p>
        <p>''I told him I didn't think it was the right thing to do,'' the manager said yesterday. ''I understood how he felt, but that has nothing to do with how you have to go about your business.''</p>
        <p>Needing more punch, Torre reinstalled Knoblauch as the D.H. and leadoff batter for Sunday's game; he had two singles in the six-run first inning that, it turned out, was enough to win. And tonight Knoblauch will again be leading off as the D.H. against the right-hander Fred Garcia.</p>
        <p>Although Griffey departed to play in his Cincinnati hometown, the Mariners still had Martinez as well as Alex Rodriguez, the dazzling shortstop. In putting together a 91-71 record (to the Yankees' 87-74), Manager Lou Piniella also had more good pitchers than before.</p>
        <p>''With the dollars that we saved,'' Piniella said, alluding to what Griffey would have cost the Mariners had he not been traded, ''we could add some pieces that made a big difference for us. One of them was Aaron Sele, who won 18 games. Another was our closer, Kazuhiro Sasaki.''</p>
        <p>Lurking behind both of these championship series is not just the World Series but a possible Subway Series, the first since 1956 when the Yankees' Don Larsen pitched a perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>
        <p>''If there's a choice of one of the two teams getting there, I hope it's us,'' Torre said, then he laughed and added, ''As for St. Louis and the Mets, I've managed and been fired from both. But if there is a Subway Series, it would be exciting for the city. I'm sure for both Bobby Valentine and myself, it would be distracting and tiring. Obviously, we have to get through two tough teams to do that.''</p>
        <p>But one of those tough teams is not the Braves, and the other tough team's center fielder is not Ken Griffey Jr.</p>
