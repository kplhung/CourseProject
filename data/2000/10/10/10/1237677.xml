        <p>Known as the Bloody Eighth, this Congressional district in southwest Indiana ranks among the nation's fiercest political battlegrounds, a region where voters have ousted a half-dozen incumbents in the past 42 years.</p>
        <p>Representative John Hostettler, a three-term Republican, faces a strong challenge from Dr. Paul Perry as Democrats try to wrest control of the House from Republicans.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the only certainty here is that voters will be electing a social conservative, since both men oppose abortion and gun control.</p>
        <p>''This one is really close,'' said Brian Vargus, the director of the public opinion laboratory at Indiana University. ''This is a district with a quirky history, and the race here is definitely in play, as always.''</p>
        <p>With a populist streak and a conservative bent, this district does not cotton to country-club Republicans or to social-engineering liberals. Bordered on the north by this city that is the home of Indiana University, the district runs south through the old industrial city of Evansville, with plenty of little towns along narrow back roads.</p>
        <p>In the view of Jason Pratt, a 23-year-old laborer at an oil company who went out the other night to buy archery supplies, it is a place where people ''want the working person to get a fair shake, and don't want politicians coming around taking our guns away.''</p>
        <p>Nobody in this race is making any such threat. Dr. Perry, the Democrat, who is a surgeon, has made health care the centerpiece of his campaign, an issue that could resonate in a district with a big share of older voters.</p>
        <p>Dr. Perry has been sharply critical of H.M.O.'s and rising costs of prescription medicine, and has branded Mr. Hostettler as too closely tied to the interests of pharmaceutical companies. To win real reform of health care, he has told voters, they need to ''put a doctor in the House.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hostettler, meanwhile, has cast himself as a champion of conservatives, a politician who broke ranks with most Republicans recently to oppose a bill intended to curb domestic violence, saying it smacked of federalism. He has challenged Dr. Perry's stance on health care issues, saying his proposals would lead to a Canadian-style system hobbled by bureaucratic rules.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hostettler, who came to office during the Republican sweep in 1994, has never received more than 52 percent of the vote in his three elections. And Democrats believe he is vulnerable, especially since he cannot portray his opponent as a liberal.</p>
        <p>Dr. Perry was not the Democrat favored among many party leaders in the primary, in which he defeated David Hamilton, the nephew of the former longtime congressman Lee Hamilton.</p>
        <p>In this race, Dr. Perry is outspending Mr. Hostettler by a margin of about two to one, according to Federal Election Commission reports.</p>
        <p>''If any Democrat is going to win back the seat, it's got to be a conservative,'' said Mr. Vargus, the pollster. ''This is not a cosmopolitan district. It's a place where you see a lot of pickup trucks with bumper stickers about guns being pulled out of my cold, dead fingers.''</p>
        <p>More than 95 percent white and about 41 percent rural, the region shares much of the flavor of the Bible Belt. Mr. Hostettler has been outspoken about his evangelical Christian faith. Dr. Perry is a Roman Catholic.</p>
        <p>Voters in this district elected four different congressmen in four successive elections in the 1970's. And the election in 1984 was so close it led to a bitter fight in Congress. In that year, state election officials announced that Representative Frank McCloskey, the Democrat, had lost by 34 votes to a Republican challenger. After a recount, Democrats, who controlled the House, decided to seat Mr. McCloskey, a move that provoked outrage among Republicans in Congress.</p>
        <p>The close battles in the district stand in sharp contrast to the voting habits of Indianians in presidential elections: Indiana went with the Democratic candidate only three times in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>But political party matters much less in this district, where many voters acknowledge that familiarity with politicians breeds a certain contempt.</p>
        <p>''One or two terms in office, that's plenty,'' said Diane Smith, a 57-year-old teacher in Vincennes. ''I want them out of there before they start getting complacent.''</p>
