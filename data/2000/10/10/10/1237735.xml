        <p>Sid Gillman, the only coach in both the college and pro football Halls of Fame, has returned to his home in Carlsbad, Calif., after being hospitalized for more than two months after surgery for an aortic aneurysm.</p>

        <p>Sid Gillman, the only coach in both the college and pro football Halls of Fame, has returned to his home in Carlsbad, Calif., after being hospitalized for more than two months after surgery for an aortic aneurysm.</p>
        <p>''He's sitting here in a wheelchair, looking good,'' Gillman's wife, Esther, said yesterday. ''He's going to start working hard, I mean really hard; a lot of physical therapy. He's going to lick it.''</p>
        <p>Gillman, who will turn 89 this month, was working out with a personal trainer at his home on Aug. 3 when he passed out. He was taken to Scripps Hospital in Encinitas, Calif., where the aneurysm was discovered and surgery was performed. He returned home Saturday.</p>
        <p>''He's adjusting,'' Mrs. Gillman said. ''Being away from home for two months is a long time. He watched a few football games yesterday; three of them, to be exact -- morning, noon and night.''</p>
        <p>Gillman coached Miami of Ohio and Cincinnati at the college level. At the pro level, he coached the Los Angeles Rams from 1955-59 and the Chargers in Los Angeles and San Diego from 1960-71, their first 12 years of existence.</p>
        <p>Bill Walsh, the former San Francisco 49ers coach, has called Gillman one of the great offensive minds in football history.(AP)</p>
        <p>COWBOYS' NGUYEN TO PLAY VS. GIANTS: Linebacker Dat Nguyen, who has missed the last three games with a sprained knee, is expected to return to the Dallas starting lineup on Sunday when the Cowboys play the Giants.</p>
        <p>Nguyen and cornerback Charlie Williams, who has not played this season, both practiced yesterday as the Cowboys (2-3) returned from a three-day weekend after an open date. Coach Dave Campo said Williams might also play.</p>
        <p>Nguyen sprained his left knee against Arizona in the second game of the season, He had a career-high 12 tackles against the Cardinals.</p>
        <p>Williams missed all of training camp and the first five games after suffering a staph infection following arthroscopic surgery on his left knee during the summer. He had 64 tackles last season, more than the 45 he had in the previous four years combined.</p>
        <p>Receivers Raghib Ismail, who has several nagging injuries, and Wane McGarity (sprained right ankle) were held out of practice yesterday, but Campo expects them to be ready for the Giants. (AP)</p>
        <p>DOLPHINS LINEMAN HAS SURGERY: Guard Mark Dixon of the Miami Dolphins will miss three to four weeks after undergoing surgery to repair an injured left elbow, the team said. Dixon, in his third season with the Dolphins, was injured during Sunday's 22-13 victory over Buffalo.</p>
        <p>The team also said the reserve linebacker Scott Galyon would be out for the remainder of the season after a magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>BILLS TO START ROB JOHNSON: Quarterback Rob Johnson of the Buffalo Bills will start against San Diego on Sunday despite injuring an arm in last Sunday's 22-13 loss to Miami, Coach Wade Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Johnson was hit in the arm by Dolphins defensive tackle Kenny Mixon while attempting a pass in the fourth quarter, and left the game.</p>
        <p>''He said it's a little sore, but that's what he's been every week,'' Phillips said of Johnson, who has had tendinitis in the arm. ''I don't think there's real concern over a change in his health. It was a little numb at the time and he didn't feel like he could throw the ball down the field far enough, so he decided to come out.''</p>
        <p>The Bills (2-3) play host to the San Diego Chargers (0-6) on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Doug Flutie, the backup quarterback, came in for Johnson and connected on 3 of 6 passes for 44 yards and an interception. It was his first game since he injured a groin muscle in the preseason.</p>
        <p>Johnson has completed 58 percent of his passes for 1,081 yards with seven touchdowns and two interceptions in five starts this season. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>COLTS RE-SIGN RUNNING BACK: Running back Paul Shields is back on the Indianapolis Colts' active roster, two days after being released. Shields re-signed with the Colts yesterday and was expected to help back up Edgerrin James. To make room on the roster, offensive lineman Tim Ridder was released.  (AP)</p>
