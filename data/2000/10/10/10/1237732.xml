        <p>EMachines and Microsoft have agreed to produce an Internet device specifically for Microsoft's MSN online service. The device will cost $400 and be called the MSN Companion. It will be based on a 200-MHz National Semiconductor Geode microprocessor and will join specialized appliances from companies like Compaq, America Online that are intended to make surfing the Web and using e-mail simpler and less expensive. The eMachines appliance will be sold through Circuit City, Office Depot, some Wal-Mart stores and other retailers. It will be promoted with a $400 rebate for customers who commit themselves to a three-year, $21.95-a-month subscription to the MSN service. Microsoft's move toward devices like the MSN Companion and other nonpersonal computers is a reversal. Its executives once ridiculed the idea of such specialized computers.</p>
