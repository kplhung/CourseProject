        <p>Hezbollah's capture of three Israeli soldiers along the Lebanese border on Saturday was a well-planned operation intended to coincide with the outburst of Palestinian protests over control of a Jerusalem site sacred to both Muslims and Jews, according to leaders of the guerrilla group and military experts.</p>

        <p>Hezbollah's capture of three Israeli soldiers along the Lebanese border on Saturday was a well-planned operation intended to coincide with the outburst of Palestinian protests over control of a Jerusalem site sacred to both Muslims and Jews, according to leaders of the guerrilla group and military experts.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah's immediate goal, they say, was to swap the three sergeants for 19 Islamic militants in Israeli jails, although in the bargaining the total may go as high as 49. Israel has said that it is holding the 19 Lebanese prisoners without trial as bargaining chips for information on three of its soldiers missing in Lebanon since 1982 and an airman, Ron Arad, whose fighter-bomber crashed in Lebanon in 1987.</p>
        <p>The two most prominent of these prisoners, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a senior Hezbollah spiritual leader, and Mustafa Dirani, head of the Believer's Resistance, were both abducted by helicopter-borne Israeli commandos.</p>
        <p>''We decided to capture a group of Israeli soldiers to exchange them with detainees in Israeli prisons,'' Sheik Naim Qassem, the Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon, was quoted as saying in local news reports today.</p>
        <p>''This is a very suitable opportunity because of the intifada,'' he added, referring to the uprising in Israel, ''and to confirm the importance of the Shebaa Farms as occupied Lebanese territory.''</p>
        <p>Shebaa Farms is a disputed border area near the Golan Heights at the base of Mount Hermon. Lebanon claims it, but Israel contends that it had belonged to Syria and was captured in the 1967 war. By Hezbollah's calculations, seizing the three Israelis was not a cross-border raid because the soldiers were actually trespassing in Lebanon. Israel is likely to see it differently.</p>
        <p>Today, as Lebanon waited nervously to see if there would be Israeli bombing or other retaliation this time, a series of international envoys raced frantically through meetings here seeking to ease tension on the volatile border and to arrange a deal to free the three captured soldiers.</p>
        <p>The Red Cross representative in Lebanon, Henri Fournier, was meeting with the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrullah, in an effort to arrange a prisoner exchange. Mr. Fournier said he was carrying a message from the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, but would not divulge its contents. Sheik Nasrullah warned of retaliation should Israel attack Lebanon, saying, ''All Zionists, soldiers and settlers would be targets to the attacks of our heroic fighters.''</p>
        <p>Hezbollah officials said their demands might be expanded to include other Palestinian and Jordanian prisoners held by Israel after Sheik Nasrullah received pleas from their families ''not to forget them.'' Release of the prisoners would be a major triumph for Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the United Nations special representative for southern Lebanon, Rolf Knutson, and the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, fresh from Damascus, met separately with the Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, and other officials to urge calm. Mr. Knutson in particular was reported to have urged Lebanon to deploy its army along the border -- where the only real force is Hezbollah -- but was rebuffed.</p>
        <p>In the raid, according to accounts in Lebanese newspapers, Hezbollah fighters cut their way through the border fence and grabbed the three Israelis from a patrol vehicle mounted with a machine gun. They wore gas masks and hurled some 15 tear gas canisters as they seized the stunned soldiers and loaded them into one of several identical civilian cars, the reports said. The cars sped off in different directions. Israeli troops along the border had already been distracted by Palestinians demonstrating some distance to the west along the border fence -- two were killed by Israeli fire and 23 wounded -- and by Hezbollah shelling nearby.</p>
        <p>On the Hezbollah television station that Saturday night, Sheik Nasrullah said: ''The aim of this operation is human. It is to secure the release of prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, but I will not go into details.''</p>
