        <p>The Chicago Fire reached the championship game at Robert F.

        <p>It is is only fitting that Major League Soccer's two best teams in the regular season will meet for the M.L.S. Cup 2000 on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Chicago Fire reached the championship game at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium by eliminating the New England Revolution and the MetroStars, while Kansas City eliminated Colorado and Los Angeles. The Fire won the league title as an expansion team in 1998, and the Wizards are making their first appearance in the championship.</p>
        <p>The game, which will broadcast live by ABC, will provide an ideal matchup. Each team ended the regular season with 57 points. The Fire won the Central Division and the Wizards won the Western Division. Chicago's 67 goals were the most in the league, while Kansas City's 29 goals allowed were the fewest, with goalkeeper Tony Meola registering 17 shutouts.</p>
        <p>Each team won a head-to-head match at home during the regular season, but this game will be on neutral turf. Chicago had a 4-7-5 record on the road; Kansas City was 5-3-8. The Wizards had the most remarkable turnaround in the league besides the MetroStars, going from second worst to best in one season, winning the tie breaker over Chicago by virtue of better overall goal differential, 47-29 to Chicago's 67-51.</p>
        <p>Chicago is fancied by many people in the league because it has several players with scoring ability. Along with Ante Razov, who scored the deciding goal to eliminate the MetroStars in the semifinals, the Fire's offensive weapons include Hristo Stoitchkov, Josh Wolff and Dema Kovalenko.</p>
        <p>Kansas City seems to rely strictly on the scoring of Miklos Molnar of Denmark, who scored the deciding goal against Los Angeles in the semifinals. Molnar had 12 of Kansas City's 47 goals, but he played only 17 games because of a strained left knee.</p>
        <p>WORLD CUP QUALIFYING</p>
        <p>The United States has a crucial game against Costa Rica tomorrow night in Columbus, Ohio. A victory will put the Americans in the regional finals, in which six countries will play a round-robin tournament next year for the three spots in the final stages of the 2002 tournament in Japan and Korea.</p>
        <p>Honduras secured a place in the regional finals on Sunday with a 1-0 victory over Jamaica, which qualified earlier for the regional finals.</p>
        <p>Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago have also qualified for the regional finals, leaving the United States, Costa Rica and Guatemala to fight for the remaining spots. Guatemala defeated Barbados on Sunday; its last game is against Costa Rica. The last game for the Americans is Nov. 15 at Barbados.</p>
        <p>Enrique Meza won his debut after replacing Coach Manuel Lapuente, who resigned after Mexico's 7-1 victory over Panama. The Mexicans trounced Trinidad and Tobago, 7-0.</p>
        <p>Romario, who scored three goals last month in his first international outing in more than two years, scored four goals on Sunday in Brazil's 6-0 triumph over Venezuela in Caracas, Venezuela.</p>
        <p>The 10 countries in the marathon tournament have reached the halfway point. Argentina is the clear leader with 22 points from five games, followed by Brazil and Paraguay, which have 17 each. Colombia is next with 15, followed by Uruguay with 14 and Ecuador with 13. The race for the four spots in Japan and Korea now appears to lie between these six.</p>
        <p>ENGLAND</p>
        <p>The English face numerous questions after their 1-0 loss to Germany on Saturday and the resignation of Coach Kevin Keegan immediately after the game, the last to be played at Wembley Stadium.</p>
        <p>Keegan's resignation left England without a permanent coach for tomorrow's World Cup qualifying game against Finland in Helsinki. Howard Wilkinson, who is the technical director for the Football Association, the country's governing body for soccer, was called in on an interim basis for the second time in 20 months. Wilkinson took over in February 1999 after Glenn Hoddle was dismissed.</p>
        <p>The big question for the English is who will be the next coach. Terry Venables, who took his country to the semifinals in the 1996 European Championships, seems to be the likely successor. With foreign coaches becoming popular in the Premier League, the English are also considering a foreigner to coach the national team.</p>
        <p>COLLEGES</p>
        <p>Despite losing to U.C.L.A., the Connecticut men's team moved to the top of the national ranking after victories over Villanova and Virginia Commonwealth.</p>
        <p>Indiana, the defending national champion, won twice to take the second spot. St. John's lost to St. Louis and dropped to 10th from third, and the Billikens moved to 15th from 22nd.</p>
        <p>In the women's poll, Notre Dame, Nebraska, North Carolina, Washington and Clemson are the top five.</p>
