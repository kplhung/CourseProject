        <p>Nets forward Jamie Feick had surgery on the Achilles' tendon in his left leg yesterday and will miss at least the first month of the National Basketball Association season.</p>
        <p>Feick, who played in 81 games last season, won't be able to start rehabilitation for six to eight weeks, General Manager John Nash said.</p>
        <p>A Michigan State product who is entering his fifth N.B.A. season, Feick averaged 5.7 points and a team-high 9.3 rebounds last season. In his two seasons with the Nets, Feick has played in 107 games, averaging 5.9 points and 9.7 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Chronic Achilles' tendinitis and a calcium deposit were diagnosed last week in Feick. He underwent a 90-minute procedure at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The Nets also released two free agents: forward Peter Cornell and guard Adrian Autry. (AP)</p>
        <p>SOME GOOD NEWS FOR MOURNING: Miami Heat All-Star center Alonzo Mourning's kidney disorder isn't life- or career-threatening, The Miami Herald reported, citing a friend with knowledge of Mourning's condition.</p>
        <p>Mourning, 30, missed the start of the Heat's training camp after doctors discovered a kidney disorder during a routine preseason physical. The team said Mourning would have additional tests.</p>
        <p>Although Mourning's ailment has not been fully diagnosed, the Heat center probably will play this season and may even be available for the Nov. 1 season opener, according to the report.</p>
        <p>Mourning had a busy off-season with the United States Olympic men's basketball team, spending six weeks traveling to Hawaii, Japan and finally Australia, where he helped the United States squad win the gold medal. He left Sydney during the Olympics and returned to Miami for the birth of his second child, then flew back to Australia for the rest of the Olympic competition.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-10 Mourning is one of the best rebounders and defensive players in the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>Mourning won the league's defensive player of the year award for the second straight time last year, finishing with a career-high 294 blocked shots. He also averaged 21.7 points and 9.5 rebounds while shooting a career-high 55 percent from the field. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>HAWKS WAIVE 3 PLAYERS: The Atlanta Hawks waived guard Michael Hawkins and forwards Jason Sasser and Pete Chilcutt, reducing their roster to 13 players.</p>
        <p>Atlanta signed all three players as free agents Oct. 3 and announced the cuts Sunday.</p>
        <p>Chilcutt, a nine-year N.B.A. veteran, also played with Sacramento, Detroit, Houston, Vancouver, Cleveland, the Los Angeles Clippers and Utah.</p>
        <p>Hawkins played last season with the Charlotte Hornets, and Sasser, a former star at Texas Tech, was waived during the preseason last year by the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
        <p>The Hawks play their first exhibition game today at Orlando and open the regular season Oct. 31 against Charlotte. (AP)</p>
