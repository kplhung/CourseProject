        <p>Two months after President Robert Mugabe bowed to election results and welcomed an opposition into the Parliament for the first time with promises of cooperation, relations have soured. The opposition leader 10 days ago warned Mr. Mugabe that if he didn't step aside, he would be ousted ''violently.''</p>
        <p>Today, the government arrested three opposition members of Parliament on charges of inciting violence and sprayed tear gas on scores of their supporters, who sang and chanted outside the courthouse before scattering through clouds of choking smoke.</p>
        <p>Officials also vowed to arrest the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, on similar grounds. The police converged on the airport this morning, awaiting Mr. Tsvangirai's return from a trip to South Africa, but he managed to elude them and returned home, where he held a news conference on his lawn.</p>
        <p>The opposition warned that arrests would only cause ''unnecessary conflict'' in the country. But neither side seemed willing to back down.</p>
        <p>The rising tensions reflect the hardening of political lines just two months after Zimbabwe's new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, took its seats in Parliament, which had long been controlled by President Robert Mugabe under a virtual one-party system. In the first heady days of the opening session, there were handshakes and kisses in the elegant chamber and promises of cooperation across party lines. But the jubilation has given way to frustration, particularly among some supporters of the opposition party.</p>
        <p>At his news conference today, Mr. Tsvangirai was defiant. He emphasized that he was committed to upholding the law. But he said he did not regret making a recent speech in which he told Mr. Mugabe, ''if you don't want to go peacefully, we will remove you violently.''</p>
        <p>''I will be phoning the commissioner of police; I understand he's looking for me,'' Mr. Tsvangirai said as the cameras rolled. ''I have no regrets. It was a very stern warning. He either chooses to go peacefully or the people may resort to uprising.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, government officials warned that the opposition politicians could be charged with treason, which carries a possible death sentence.</p>
        <p>''He is a criminal,'' Jonathan Moyo, the minister of information, said of Mr. Tsvangirai in an interview today. ''He has violated the law. These people are not Martin Luther Kings. This is an organization full of individuals who will not hesitate to use violence.''</p>
        <p>The Movement for Democratic Change, which won 57 of the 120 seats that were up for a vote in the June elections, is still outnumbered and outvoted by the governing party. The collapsing economy, which propelled most urban voters to abandon Mr. Mugabe's party, continues to unravel. The government continues to disregard court rulings and to suppress freedom of speech.</p>
        <p>Within the opposition, a small but vocal group is beginning to argue that the party should push the public to take to the streets and force Mr. Mugabe out of office before his term ends in 2002.</p>
        <p>Most opposition members still prefer to oppose the government in Parliament. And they insist that Mr. Tsvangirai's comment about an uprising was a slip of the tongue and not official policy.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tsvangirai has not hesitated to compare Mr. Mugabe to Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who was forced out of power by popular will. And it is no secret that some opposition officials have been inspired by the events in Yugoslavia and now see popular protest as a way to bring an end to Mr. Mugabe's government, after 20 years in power.</p>
        <p>''There is this push to have a popular revolution to oust the president, but that is not the way forward,'' said Alfred Nhema, a political analyst and the chairman of the political science department at the University of Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>''I think it was just an off-the-cuff remark, something he said that he shouldn't have said,'' Mr. Nhema said. ''But there is danger when a leader starts calling for uprising. People are frustrated with the political situation. People are frustrated with the economic situation.</p>
        <p>''But it is also politically unwise to arrest him. It just worsens the political divide between the two parties.''</p>
        <p>At his news conference, Mr. Tsvangirai urged his supporters to remain peaceful and to avoid demonstrations that might result in clashes with the government. But it is unclear how people will react if he is arrested.</p>
        <p>At least 30 people were killed and hundreds were injured in political violence in the period before the June elections, most of them opposition supporters. But voters in the city still flocked to the polls, giving Parliament its biggest opposition presence in 20 years.</p>
        <p>For the first time in Zimbabwe's history, a single opposition party can now prevent Mr. Mugabe's party from unilaterally changing the Constitution. The governing party, which won 62 seats, had controlled all but 3 seats since the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>But the high -- and perhaps unrealistic -- expectations of change have yet to materialize. Black squatters still occupy more than 1,000 white-owned farms despite court orders requiring their eviction.</p>
        <p>Many people suspect that Mr. Mugabe will seek another term despite promises that the old guard in the governing party would make way for a new generation. And the economy still lags.</p>
        <p>The government has made some changes. The police seem to be responding to reports of violence on some farms. The two technocrats recently selected for the ministries of finance and industry are widely praised. But the nation's hardships show no sign of diminishing.</p>
        <p>This year, the economy is expected to contract by 5 percent according to the World Bank. In 2001, the gross domestic product may shrink between 6 to 10 percent. The nation is already suffering from fuel shortages. And per capita spending on public health services has plummeted to below 1980 levels. In a strikingly frank news conference last week, Simba Makoni, the finance minister, pleaded for international aid, telling the world that his country could no longer pay many of its creditors. ''We need help,'' he said, ''and we need it urgently.''</p>
        <p>Some opposition members suspect that the government is using the crackdown on the opposition to distract the nation from its economic problems. The three members of Parliament who were arrested were accused of making inflammatory speeches at rallies over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsvangirai, who made his speech on Sept. 30, was traveling abroad until today. He refused to say how he managed to sneak back into the country, but he rolled into his driveway in a maroon Nissan Hardbody. First he hugged his wife and then he told the throngs of waiting journalists that he was not afraid of being arrested.</p>
        <p>''Everyone must remain calm,'' Mr. Tsvangirai said. ''The country does not deserve havoc and anarchy.''</p>
        <p>But he did not hesitate when asked whether he saw similarities between Zimbabwe and Yugoslavia, where thousands of people filled the streets and shut down the mines and other industries to force Mr. Milosevic out of power.</p>
        <p>''The only difference,'' he said, ''is they are white and we are black.''</p>
