        <p>The Sony Corporation raised the blood pressure of millions of American parents recently when it announced that its initial shipment of PlayStation 2, the cutting-edge entertainment device that is expected to be the hottest gift of this holiday season, would be half what it had promised. Only 500,000 machines will arrive in stores on Oct. 26, not a million, Sony said.</p>
        <p>It blamed a shortage of components but has refused to specify which parts are involved, creating one of the year's more intriguing technology mysteries.</p>
        <p>But Sony's reason for not pointing a finger is becoming clearer: it would probably have had to point at itself. For this intensely proud company, which meticulously cultivates a global image, that would be highly embarrassing.</p>
        <p>The parts in question are almost surely either one or both of two complex semiconductors that are the heart and soul of PlayStation 2. Sony itself makes the graphic synthesizer, and a central processor called the Emotion Engine is also made by Sony, with production overseen by Toshiba. Ever since PlayStation 2 was first shown in March 1999, analysts, competitors and suppliers have questioned the company's ability to meet its own production goals on those chips.</p>
        <p>''Sony talks a very aggressive line,'' said Steven W. Myers, who follows industrial electronics at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. ''but they are not semiconductor people and they don't necessarily know how difficult manufacturing chips can be. To design all out for performance, as they have done, without taking into account manufacturability -- to just assume it -- that's a bit presumptuous.''</p>
        <p>Sony Computer Entertainment, the unit that oversees PlayStation, has assured analysts that enough usable Emotion Engines and graphic synthesizers are being produced to meet demand.</p>
        <p>The company says it will still manage to ship just about as many PlayStation 2 units to the United States by Christmas as it had planned -- 1.3 million to 1.4 million. If they do not arrive until late December, though, this would presumably disrupt many retailers' plans and promotions.</p>
        <p>In the end, all the talk about the cutback may work to Sony's advantage, whetting buyers' appetites. Web chat rooms have suggested that Sony's sharply curtailed shipment plans were pure marketing, aimed at creating a feverish demand, but Sony Computer Entertainment denies that.</p>
        <p>The revised shipping schedule, though, raises questions as well about whether Sony can keep its promise to introduce the device in Europe next month, and longer term, whether it can rev up production enough to keep customers from deciding to wait and see what alternatives Microsoft and Nintendo have to offer next year. Microsoft's device is tentatively called X-Box, and Nintendo's is code-named Dolphin.</p>
        <p>''PlayStation 2 is a loss-making business at this stage anyway,'' said Masashi Kubota, an analyst at ING Barings here. ''But it is Sony's core product, and everyone expected production would show a huge increase by the end of this fiscal year in March. Now, we have questions about that.''</p>
        <p>Semiconductors are devilishly delicate to produce. As their power increases, so does the manufacturing difficulty -- and the cost. Typically, in the initial stages of production, the number of good chips in every batch, or the yield, is low -- but improves over time. The more advanced the chip, though, the longer it takes to improve the yield, even by the most experienced chip makers. And the new Sony machine's chips ''are incredibly complex,'' an engineer at a Japanese competitor said.</p>
        <p>''They have to be admired for the effort,'' the engineer said, ''but at the same time, maybe they did not realize the inherent limitations.''</p>
        <p>Sony Computer Entertainment refused to comment on how many chips it can turn out or whether yields had fallen short of projections. Chip makers typically do not discuss yields. It also refused to say when it first knew it would have to reduce shipments, though it said it had announced the decrease in ''a swift manner.''</p>
        <p>But executives in Silicon Valley and its Tokyo counterpart, Bit Valley, many of whom have worked with Sony Computer Entertainment and other Japanese chip makers, are convinced that Sony's problems are its own. It would be hard, they said, for a shortage of relatively common components like diodes or monitors to cause such a sharp cutback in shipment plans.</p>
        <p>For one thing, several electronic components that were in short supply earlier this year have become much easier to obtain. And a shortage of such components would have been obvious months ago, engineers say. ''The difference in supplying 500,000 machines and one million machines is enormous,'' an executive at a West Coast chip maker said. ''Having trouble getting laser dials or capacitors wouldn't cause such a revision.''</p>
        <p>While the quality of Sony's electronics is high, the company is not regarded as a top-flight semiconductor maker. Its plans to produce one of the world's most complicated chips on its own surprised many in the industry. Sony is working hard to join the big leagues of chip making, reorganizing its semiconductor unit this fall and hiring a headhunter to recruit Tsugio Makimoto, the chief of technology at Hitachi -- a kind of poaching that is unheard of in Japan.</p>
        <p>But oddly, Sony's semiconductor unit has nothing to do with the chips that power PlayStation 2, a corporate spokesman said. Sony Computer Entertainment jealously guards its turf, insisting on almost total control over the product, right down to the workers at the factories where PlayStation 2 chips are produced.</p>
        <p>Such unit autonomy is unusual within Japanese companies, and Sony has been praised for allowing Ken Kutaragi, the hard-charging, often audacious engineer who created the PlayStation business, free rein. Rather than stifling Mr. Kutaragi's idiosyncrasies, Sony cultivated them, allowing him to set up the PlayStation operations in Akasaka, a bustling neighborhood known for its restaurants and night life, rather than industrial Shinagawa, where the corporate headquarters are.</p>
        <p>He was allowed to establish a compensation system at Sony Computer Entertainment tied far more to performance than elsewhere in the huge company. And Sony's public relations people learned to bite their tongues as he repeatedly criticized the corporation for its stodginess -- even while noting that the only place in Japan he could have realized his full potential was at Sony.</p>
        <p>In exchange for that freedom, Mr. Kutaragi built a business that redefined the video game industry and became the biggest contributor to Sony's bottom line -- for a time.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, though, it has been a drag on Sony's resources. The company was forced to recall the first PlayStation 2 consoles it shipped out in Japan because enterprising buyers quickly figured how to override the copyright-protection mechanism that prevents the DVD player in the Japanese machine from playing DVD discs made for American or European machines. (American and European models will contain similar devices in reverse.)</p>
        <p>The company expects to spend $2.4 billion on PlayStation 2 by the end of March, much of that on manufacturing the two basic chips. The machine was a big factor in the $808 million hole in Sony's bottom line in the quarter that ended on June 30.</p>
        <p>As yields of the two chips increase, costs will fall and Sony's profit on the machine will rise. Sales in Japan, where about three million people have purchased a PlayStation 2 since its introduction in March, have exceeded expectations.</p>
        <p>Yet the sale of game software, the real money maker in this business, has been slow. Sony makes some games, and gets a cut from game developers for those it does not produce. Designers say it is harder to create software for PlayStation 2 than for its predecessor because of the complexity of the new chips. In May, when Sony announced its plans for the machine in the United States, it said that at least 50 titles would be available by year's end. It now looks as if somewhat more than half that number will be available.</p>
        <p>''Sales of the software have not been as good as their initial expectations,'' said Toshiya Tsuchikawa, an analyst at Shinko Securities here.</p>
        <p>How much of its investment in PlayStation 2 Sony recoups will depend heavily on software sales, since it is widely assumed that at $299 or so for each machine, it loses money on the hardware.</p>
        <p>That is because of those fancy chips, capable in an instant of generating remarkably lifelike images. A car race or a football game on the machine can be mistaken for a film of the real thing.</p>
        <p>To produce such images, Sony has had to sharply reduce the time it takes PlayStation 2 to retrieve information and forward it to the central processing unit, the Emotion Engine. So it chose to plant a garden-variety memory chip right on its graphic synthesizer, engineers at rival manufacturers say, rather than storing memory on a stand-alone chip.</p>
        <p>Thanks to that embedded chip, the Emotion Engine can simultaneously manage 50,000 images made of some 300,000 polygonal shapes a second -- a new global standard.</p>
        <p>The graphic synthesizer renders 75 million pixels a second, a rival says, compared with 5 million for one made by NEC for Sega's Dreamcast. The chip moves data at 48 gigabytes a second, compared with 1.6 gigabytes for chips in most newer computers.</p>
        <p>But logic chips like the graphic synthesizer are tricky to make, with intricate circuitry. Using embedded memory improves performance but also takes up space, forcing either an increase in chip size, which lowers yields, or a decrease in performance.</p>
        <p>And Sony Computer started a second production line only in late summer, a spokesman said, and it may be taking longer than anticipated for yields on the new line to improve.</p>
        <p>Another explanation for the reduced shipment plans could be the move this summer to produce some Emotion Engine chips with circuitry wires just 0.18 micron thick, instead of 0.25 micron, which has been the industry standard. This will allow more circuitry to be packed onto a chip, helping with speed and the manipulation of data.</p>
        <p>Even at 0.25 micron, the manufacture of Emotion Engines is no easy feat, and the additional degree of difficulty could have slowed production.</p>
        <p>A Toshiba spokeswoman said the transition to 0.18 micron technology had gone well, which is also what company executives have told analysts. But what that means in terms of yield is anyone's guess, Mr. Myers said, since manufacturers around the world have been struggling to make this technology work.</p>
        <p>Toshiba has denied that any of its components are the source of Sony's problems, and Sony Computer Entertainment confirmed that.</p>
        <p>Whether the Emotion Engine is considered a Toshiba component or a Sony component is unclear. The companies jointly designed the chip, which is made in an annex at Toshiba's Oita factory that was paid for by Sony. Each company claims it as its own, so it is unclear whether the statement that no component supplied by Toshiba was in short supply includes the Emotion Engine.</p>
