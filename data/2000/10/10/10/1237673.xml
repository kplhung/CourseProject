        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio today stepped up his criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton's response to the violence in the Middle East, suggesting Mrs. Clinton should have used her stated influence with the president to persuade him to veto the United Nations resolution censuring Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, sought to turn Mrs. Clinton's previous statements that she was a silent force behind many White House policies against her. If that is the case, he said, Mrs. Clinton should have been able to sway administration officials to vote against the resolution Saturday night, instead of abstaining.</p>

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio today stepped up his criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton's response to the violence in the Middle East, suggesting Mrs. Clinton should have used her stated influence with the president to persuade him to veto the United Nations resolution censuring Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, sought to turn Mrs. Clinton's previous statements that she was a silent force behind many White House policies against her. If that is the case, he said, Mrs. Clinton should have been able to sway administration officials to vote against the resolution Saturday night, instead of abstaining.</p>
        <p>''Either you have the influence to affect policy or you don't,'' Mr. Lazio said before a campaign stop in Rochester. ''And the question is, which one is it here?''</p>
        <p>In their televised debate on Sunday, Mr. Lazio had somewhat mild criticism of Mrs. Clinton on the Middle East, but in news conferences since then he has turned up the rancor.</p>
        <p>With the pivotal Jewish vote at stake in the state, Mrs. Clinton, too, spoke out again today on the violence that began after an Israeli opposition leader visited a contested religious site on Sept. 28, setting off disturbances that have left at least 89 dead, mostly Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton sharpened her criticism of Palestinian authorities, saying that the attack on Saturday by hundreds of Palestinians on a Jewish holy site known as Joseph's Tomb justified the use of force by Israel in protecting its religious shrines.</p>
        <p>''I am deeply distressed by the desecration of the Tomb of Joseph,''  Mrs. Clinton told reporters before marching in the Columbus Day parade in Manhattan (she marched several blocks behind Mr. Lazio). ''The Palestinian Authority did not protect that religious site as they had agreed to, which raises, for me, very serious questions that I can only conclude lead to one answer: that Israel must have the right to defend and protect its religious sites.''</p>
        <p>With polls suggesting a tight race, neither candidate wants to risk alienating a powerful bloc like the Jewish vote. Accordingly, in recent days they have sparred over who has more forcefully defended Israel, but Mr. Lazio suggested for the first time that Mrs. Clinton could have played a direct role in influencing American foreign policy.</p>
        <p>''I think Mrs. Clinton should have stood up and said either she can't take credit for the things that happen that are good and then just say when things are bad that she's got nothing to do with that,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''It's one or the other.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton suggested negotiations were too delicate to assert herself more directly. ''I can only speak for myself,'' she replied when asked how her criticism of the Palestinians might affect peace talks. ''My husband and his administration are working very hard to end the violence, and they are taking the steps, obviously, they believe will lead to an end to violence and a return to the negotiating table.''</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said of Mr. Lazio's criticism, ''I don't think there is 1 New Yorker in 10 who believes Rick Lazio would go into the Senate with more clout than Hillary Clinton has.''</p>
        <p>Both candidates also worked to appeal to another powerful constituency, Italian-Americans, who in the past have made up the largest ethnic voting bloc. The candidates were accompanied at the parade by a cluster of party officials: Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and Senator John McCain of Arizona for Mr. Lazio, and, for Mrs. Clinton, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, Andrew M. Cuomo, and the former vice presidential candidate Geraldine A. Ferraro.</p>
        <p>Both campaigns stopped before St. Patrick's Cathedral to greet officials with the Archdiocese of New York. But only Mr. Lazio's entourage shook hands with Archbishop Edward M.  Egan. Some confusion in the crowd prompted Mrs. Clinton's group to move beyond the cathedral, without greeting the archbishop himself. Her staff said last night they had offered an apology to the archdiocese.</p>
        <p>Later, Mrs. Clinton attended a rally of Italian-American Democrats in Westchester County, but her campaign canceled an appearance in Woonsocket, R.I., citing mechanical problems with her plane.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, meanwhile, attended a ''Rigatoni for Rick'' dinner at an Italian restaurant here.</p>
        <p>Tonight he was on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' where he again complained about Democratic Party operatives who have videotaped his campaign appearances. He said they had also been ''sort of harassing'' his wife at public events.</p>
        <p>But Peter Kauffmann, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party, said that the party sends people only to public campaign events.</p>
        <p>''The fact of the matter is that the Lazio campaign has sent people to Hillary Clinton's front lawn to videotape her,'' Mr. Kauffmann said. ''Frequently on the campaign trail, people with Lazio signs shout crude epihets. But we don't complain about it. We understand that what our candidate says at campaign events are a matter of public record.''</p>
