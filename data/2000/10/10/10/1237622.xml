        <p>THE first worldwide campaign for Kotex seeks to surmount cultural, geographic and demographic boundaries by focusing on something women have in common: their need for feminine hygiene products.</p>
        <p>The campaign by Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, is the most recent in an intensely competitive category dominated by a handful of major marketers like Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kotex. The campaign promotes two new Kotex products with a symbol meant to be universal: a red dot.</p>
        <p>''When you show that red dot, without speaking a single word, women know what that means,'' said Christine Schipke, senior partner and group creative director at the Ogilvy Chicago office.</p>
        <p>''It's your period,'' she added, ''and we're going to call it your period.''</p>
        <p>The campaign, aimed primarily at women ages 15 to 24, begins in North America in early October with two print advertisements, two television commercials and a Web site banner ad, all carrying this theme: ''Kotex Fits. Period.'' Initial spending on North American advertising and promotion -- augmented by redesigned packages decorated with dots -- is being estimated at $25 million; the campaign, which is already running in Latin America, is to be introduced in Europe in March.</p>
        <p>The campaign presents viewers and readers with large amounts of ''white space'' and small drawings of the new products, Kotex Maxi With Wings and Kotex Long Super With Wings. That leaves room for plenty of playful copy meant to describe how women actually feel when they have their periods.</p>
        <p>For instance, one print ad, showing a red circle, begins: ''You fought with your mom. You fought with your boyfriend. You fought with your jeans. Oh, please, like you have any energy left to wrestle a pad.''</p>
        <p>The other print ad plays on the double meaning of the word ''period.'' Both menstruation and punctuation have ''a way of getting in the way,'' the ad declares, illustrating the point with this headline: ''Don't. Let a pe.riod. Stop. You.''</p>
        <p>In a TV spot, the red dot becomes the ''o'' in the word ''Yo'' and is seen going up and down smoothly, but then starts bouncing around erratically, imitating what a woman's emotions may do during her period. Charlex in New York worked with Ogilvy to create the animation for the dot television spots.</p>
        <p>The previous Ogilvy campaign for Kotex -- introduced in fall 1998 and created solely for North America -- seemed more traditional, promoting product qualities like strength and softness with the theme, ''You've got it together with Kotex.''</p>
        <p>That campaign ''put a contemporary face on Kotex,'' said Barbara Jurgens, managing partner at Ogilvy Chicago, but the red dot ads are ''just more breakthrough, more differentiating.''</p>
        <p>The idea for a worldwide campaign dates back about three years.</p>
        <p>''We were taking a hard look at our business globally,'' said Aida Flick, marketing director for the North American feminine care business at Kimberly-Clark, which markets Kotex, because ''we weren't managing as efficiently as we could.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Flick, who is based in Neenah, Wis., said the company undertook a study to determine how women felt about their periods and various feminine-care products. The primary question, she recalled, was, ''Are they really more similar than they are different, or more different than they are similar?''</p>
        <p>The results, Ms. Flick said, showed that most women around the world -- regardless of where or how they live or what generation they belong to -- were looking for emotional reassurance during their periods, in addition to reassurance that the products are reliable.</p>
        <p>''When I have my period, it's not just any other day,'' Ms. Flick said. ''It's not just a physical thing that is happening to me.''</p>
        <p>The campaign will run in magazines like Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Seventeen and Teen People and on networks like ABC, Fox, MTV, NBC and the WB during series like ''Dawson's Creek,'' ''Days of Our Lives,'' ''Felicity'' and ''Passions.''</p>
        <p>The casual frankness of the Kotex campaign is indicative of a new tone in ads for such products, moving beyond shots of women climbing mountains in white pants or demonstrations of blue liquid being poured onto pads.</p>
        <p>In March, Procter &amp; Gamble began a campaign for Always sanitary napkins that did not show women or products. Rather, the ads were centered on young, physically fit men in humorous situations. The campaign was created by D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles Worldwide in New York, part of the B Com3  Group.</p>
        <p>P.&amp; G. also recently put up a Web site about feminine hygiene at BeingGirl.com, with links from the sites for Always and another Procter brand, Tampax. And Playtex Products Inc., which sells tampons but not sanitary pads, has been encouraging the use of tampons at a younger age through a campaign created by Grey Worldwide in New York, part of the Grey Global Group.</p>
