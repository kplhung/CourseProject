        <p>The new president of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica, took a firmer hold on power today, with the resignation of two crucial allies of Slobodan Milosevic and the announcement of early elections to the Serbian Parliament.</p>
        <p>One of those who resigned, signaling the further dismantling of the old federal government, was the Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic. Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic, who controlled the Serbian police, also resigned.</p>
        <p>In other encouraging news for the new government, the European Union lifted major sanctions and pledged to contribute about $2 billion in aid to help rebuild Yugoslavia. [Page A10.]</p>
        <p>Milan Milutinovic, the president of Serbia -- the most important of the two remaining republics that comprise Yugoslavia -- and leaders of the parties in the Serbian Parliament agreed to dissolve it and call elections for mid-December, probably on Dec. 17.</p>
        <p>The Serbian Parliament, which had been controlled by Mr. Milosevic with the Serbian Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj, was not up for election on Sept. 24, when Mr. Kostunica defeated Mr. Milosevic for the federal presidency and elections were held for the federal Parliament.</p>
        <p>Yet it is in Serbia and in its government where real constitutional power lies, not in the federal government. Under Mr. Milosevic, constitutional distinctions mattered less in a system he controlled.</p>
        <p>But under Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, the distinctions between the narrow competency of the federal government and the broad powers of the Serbian one will have greater impact. After new elections,  almost sure to include voting for a new Serbian president, conflicts within a fragile opposition suddenly in power could become more obvious, and Mr. Kostunica's power may be less sweeping than it appears now.</p>
        <p>In this half-finished revolution, when Mr. Kostunica's allies consider Mr. Milosevic's continuing control over the Serbian police and special police their greatest danger, dismantling the Serbian power structure has been crucial.</p>
        <p>The new government made an important start today, with the agreement for new Serbian elections and the resignation under pressure of Mr. Stojiljkovic, the interior minister. But Rade Markovic, the chief of the secret police, has still not resigned and is feeling more confident about his position, a political leader said tonight.</p>
        <p>New Serbian elections should do much to wipe out the parliamentary position of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party and its coalition partner, the Yugoslav United Left of his wife, Mirjana Markovic. For that reason alone, said Ognjen Pribicevic, an adviser to a leader in the new government, the agreements today matter.</p>
        <p>''The Socialist Party will be over for now, that's the most important thing, which means that Milosevic will be over,'' he said. ''It means we are entering a new time.''</p>
        <p>He is also very concerned about the situation in the manifold layers of the Serbian police that Mr. Milosevic pampered and nurtured, even if they were unwilling to shoot at protesters last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica's allies want the Interior Ministry job for themselves in what would be a provisional, all-party Serbian government to run the republic until the December elections. But negotiations bogged down today with the parties currently in the Serbian Parliament, especially with Mr. Seselj, who wants more seats in the new government but who also spoke trenchantly and bitterly about the extra-legal revolutionary capturing of institutions by some of Mr. Kostunica's supporters.</p>
        <p>''We are not willing to legalize this putsch,'' Mr. Seselj said. ''We have been robbed of the police. Everything being done now is unlawful, and we refuse to give it an umbrella of legitimacy. If there a chance to put things back into legal and constitutional boundaries, we will play along. Revolution is revolution, and a putsch is a putsch. It is honorable to be a counterrevolutionary today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seselj has broken with Mr. Milosevic and helped Mr. Kostunica challenge election fraud. But he is also trying to protect his party, which could suffer badly in new elections, and negotiate a better deal with the new democratic forces.</p>
        <p>A supporter of Mr. Kostunica, Dragan Veselinov, a party leader from Vojvodina, answered: ''This is not about a coup, this is not about a putsch. This is about the will of the people. The people have taken power. That's what this is about. The people spoke at elections you convoked.''</p>
        <p>He criticized the Milosevic coalition for hanging on when it has been so thoroughly repudiated and said: ''You are the former ones. You are ghosts from the past. This nation is watching you for the last time. Your faces will no longer be around in December. In nine and a half weeks, people will only see smiles here.''</p>
        <p>The bitterness is real. Mr. Kostunica talks of constitutional legality, but others in the coalition that backed him fear that if they move too slowly to assert control over every powerful institution, Mr. Milosevic and his allies will take advantage of legal niceties and stage a comeback.</p>
        <p>It is an awkward mix, conceded Cedomir Jovanovic, a top aide to the opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party. ''We started a process and our intention now is to legitimate that process,'' Mr. Jovanovic said. ''But to slow it down or even stop it would be dangerous.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seselj's presidential candidate, Tomislav Nikolic, carried the accusation further. ''You would have never proved electoral theft if we had not helped you,'' he said. ''Everything else that carried over into Serbia -- which was not at issue in this election -- is a putsch. It is not the people's will for you to go into universities and take over,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Now you're looking for the government of Serbia to provide you with a veneer of legality,'' Mr. Nikolic said. ''You break down doors. You depose and fire people, you come in with guns and pistols. Have any of these here present dictators, as you routinely call them, ever put a gun to any of your heads?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seselj then warned that ''this revolution, too, will soon start eating its children,'' especially over the issues of money, benefits and privileges that power brings.</p>
        <p>Despite the criticism, however, the Parliament will be dissolved and a new Serbian government will be negotiated, with opposition membership, that will further dismantle Mr. Milosevic's control.</p>
        <p>The newly elected federal Parliament is still squabbling, but the resignation of Mr. Bulatovic, the prime minister, makes it more likely that his Montenegrin Socialist Party will go into coalition with Mr. Kostunica's supporters in the federal government.</p>
        <p>Because the September election was boycotted by the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, the pro-Western leader, he has no seats in the new Yugoslav Parliament. But Mr. Kostunica wants to find a federal government, possibly made up of technicians and experts, that Mr. Djukanovic can tacitly support, at least until new federal elections could take place.</p>
        <p>A decision by the Serbian parliament to reject a motion to scrap a Milosevic law banning political activity at universities brought a few hundred students to protest outside the Parliament. They booed Mr. Draskovic and staged a march on Mr. Milosevic's home in the suburb of Dedinje, which was easily deflected by the police.</p>
        <p>There was a moment of drama when Mr. Seselj, a bruising figure, left the Parliament, and some protesters, saying that he was obstructing democratic change, scuffled with his bodyguards. A weapon was fired into the air, but no one was hurt.</p>
        <p>There were more moments of revolutionary revenge today. Workers attacked Radoman Bozovic, a Milosevic ally and director of Genex, the largest state-run import-export company. He tried to flee from his car, but he was caught and beaten. His bodyguards snatched him and moved him into a nearby building for safety. Later, Mr. Bozovic resigned.</p>
        <p>In a plaintive appeal, Yugoslavia's Defense Minister, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, urged Mr. Milosevic's allies to rally. Otherwise, he said in an open letter, the Serbs might face extinction as a people, saying that ''disunity among the Serbs is inciting the plans of our proven enemies'' to occupy the country, referring to allegations that the new government here is subject to NATO control.</p>
