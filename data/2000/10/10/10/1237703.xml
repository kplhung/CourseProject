        <p>Orpheus Chamber Orchestra  Carnegie Hall</p>
        <p>The 28th season of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, which opened on Saturday evening, comes with a fascinating perspective on the group's accomplishment. In March, the Prague Chamber Orchestra, which set a precedent in playing conductorless, appears at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>That group, though not heard since 1968, shortly after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, is fondly recalled for a dark passion and easy, understated virtuosity. In contrast, Orpheus has always conveyed the impression of bright, youthful vigor and a delight in virtuosic display.</p>
        <p>Such was certainly the case here in Beethoven's Eighth Symphony, given a blistering romp: the ideal approach to a work that has little on its mind but mischief. Todd Phillips, the concertmaster of the moment in the orchestra's rotating system, seemed to distribute his own quivering energy in electric bolts. The unusual prominence of the woodwinds throughout seemed to stem more from the relative smallness of the string sections than from any indiscipline or imbalance, and gave the work unusual, piquant colorings.</p>
        <p>Those strings gave a lovely account of Stravinsky's ballet score ''Apollo,'' chastely classical despite rather soupy solos from the concertmaster here, Nicolas Danielson. The rhythmic lift and spring were especially fine in the Pas de Deux.</p>
        <p>In the little abstract plot of Strauss's Duet-Concertino, Charles Neidich's clarinet taught Frank Morelli's bassoon to sing, the bassoon persuaded the oboe to cavort, and the two ended in a lovely dance.</p>
        <p>''Midday Thoughts,'' a tasteful realization of a Copland sketch by David Del Tredici, given its New York premiere here, proved a pleasant but distinctly minor lyrical effusion.</p>
