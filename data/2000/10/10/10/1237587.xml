        <p>THE FIRST AMERICAN  The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin  By H. W. Brands  759 pages. Doubleday. $35.</p>
        <p>Thomas Jefferson hailed him as ''the ornament of our country.'' John Keats described him as ''a philosophical Quaker full of mean and thrifty maxims.'' And his colleague and sometimes bitter rival John Adams acknowledged that his reputation ''was more universal than that of Leibniz or Newton, Frederick or Voltaire, and his character more beloved and esteemed than any or all of them.''</p>
        <p>Benjamin Franklin was not only the diplomat who persuaded France to become an American ally, thereby galvanizing the fledging country's victory in its war for independence, but was also one of the chief architects of the peace negotiated with Britain. He wrote the proposal that became the starting point for the Articles of Confederation, signed the Declaration of Independence and helped preside over the Constitutional Convention.</p>
        <p>In addition to his famous experiments with electricity, he perfected a new form of indoor heating, founded the first subscription library in America and organized Philadelphia's first fire companies. He was also celebrated in his day as a philosopher, writer, publisher, bon vivant and wit. By the early 1770's, H. W. Brands writes in ''The First American,'' his new biography, ''Franklin was by far the most famous American in the world.''</p>
        <p>What's most surprising about Mr. Brands's new book is that he manages to make Benjamin Franklin . . . well, boring. Though the volume attests to copious research, its novelistic narrative is flat, uninflected and unfocused. Nearly as much space is devoted to the picaresque and not terribly momentous adventures of the young Franklin as there is to his later involvement in the colonies' fight for independence. The book is also padded with unnecessary descriptions of the statesman's summer travels, his struggles with gout and his inconsequential contretemps with youthful associates. Indeed, the reader finishes this book longing for the sort of shapely, analytic assessment of Franklin that, say, Joseph Ellis provided for two other founding fathers in his recent books on John Adams (''Passionate Sage'') and Thomas Jefferson (''American Sphinx'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Brands, a professor of history at Texas A&amp;M University and the author of a biography of Theodore Roosevelt (''T. R.: The Last Romantic''), describes Franklin as projecting a reasonable, understated persona, ''one that accommodated others rather than confronting them.'' He describes Franklin as being ''an idealist of a very practical sort'' -- a civic-minded entrepreneur, a common-sense-minded scientist, a man possessed of ''an equipoise that nearly everyone who knew him noticed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brands goes on, ''It could make him seem smug or shallow; while others agonized upon life's deep issues, Franklin contented himself with incomplete answers, maintaining an open mind and seeming to skate upon life's surface.''</p>
        <p>This is the most insight Mr. Brands offers into Franklin's personality. He never penetrates Franklin's placid demeanor to limn his inner life or probe the sources of his equipoise. He never looks at the psychological roots of Franklin's hearty optimism: his easy Enlightenment faith in progress and ''the growing felicity of mankind.'' Nor does he seriously examine Franklin's decidedly lackadaisical attitude toward family life: his decision to allow his foreign postings to separate him for 18 years from his wife, Deborah; and his later reluctance to reconcile with his son William, whose royalist politics had estranged them.</p>
        <p>The only time the reader gets a visceral sense of Franklin's character is when Mr. Brands quotes from his copious writings -- from his satiric ventures into journalism (often in the guise of a carefully crafted alter ego), his flirtatious letters to a bevy of younger women or his famous autobiography. What we get for the most part from Mr. Brands is an earnest but plodding inventory of Franklin's eclectic interests and achievements along with lots of sketchy, panoramic descriptions of the historical backdrop (in America, England and France) against which the colonies' fight for independence was waged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brands minutely chronicles Franklin's gradual and somewhat belated move from ''intense attachment to the British empire'' to impassioned ''resistance to British tyranny.'' And he similarly traces Franklin's gradual embrace of abolitionism, moving from acquiescence in the compromises on slavery made at the Constitutional Convention to a decision to forward an antislavery petition to Congress in 1790.</p>
        <p>In the course of telling the story of Franklin's life, Mr. Brands repeatedly underscores his subject's importance, arguing that ''of those patriots who made independence possible, none mattered more than Franklin, and only Washington mattered as much.'' He dismisses Franklin's occasional critics, like John Adams, calling them ''jealous of one who mastered nearly everything to which he turned his mind,'' and he tries to put a heroic gloss on virtually everything Franklin did. At one point, he even argues that the statesman's pursuit of various women during his crucial negotiations with France was part of his public duty, writing that ''for the French, Franklin embodied America,'' and ''if they saw in the septuagenarian gallant a reflection of what they hoped to be at his age -- a lover of life, in all its glorious ramifications -- that could only redound to America's benefit.''</p>
        <p>Such facile cheerleading on Mr. Brands's part does not burnish Franklin's posthumous reputation but merely points up the inadequacies of this uninspired and ultimately shallow biography.</p>
