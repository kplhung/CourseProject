        <p>Jim Fassel really wanted to feel good about winning Sunday's game at Atlanta. He forced himself to consider another Giants road victory, a 4-2 record and a tie with Washington atop the National Football Conference East. Then he popped in a videotape of the 13-6 victory over the Falcons, and all of his fears came rushing back.</p>
        <p>There was his offense unable to score. There was the secondary, with the exception of Jason Sehorn, again susceptible to deep passes. The videotape provided a happy ending, although it was less than convincing.</p>
        <p>True, the Giants ended a two-game slump on the road with a defensive stand to end the game. But Fassel knew why he and his players were less than giddy after the game.</p>
        <p>''You always need to feel good about winning a football game,'' Fassel said, sounding as if he were trying to force the feeling himself. ''I looked at the tape, and it scared me because in this league, you're always evaluating certain things and we won that game. And the reason we won that game is we played better than they did. I didn't say we played good.''</p>
        <p>Fassel had plenty to fret about. He was satisfied that the team finally pressured a quarterback -- the Giants registered four sacks -- but noted that the pass defense and inconsistent special teams needed improvement. For all their problems, the Falcons threw for 255 yards on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Still, most disturbing was an offense that Fassel thought he had successfully tweaked in the off-season. By handing off play-calling duties to the offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, rebuilding the offensive line, stressing the run and making Kerry Collins the lone quarterback, Fassel figured he had addressed every need of a lethargic unit.</p>
        <p>But each game increasingly makes this team resemble the same old Giants, this team's greatest fear. Again on Sunday, the defense had to bail out the offense. For all the changes, this season is mimicking last season, which degenerated into finger-pointing. Linebacker Jessie Armstead took the most heat for blaming the offense a year ago. But he was supportive through the good times last month and was not ready to abandon hope because of Sunday.</p>
        <p>''We're going to stay behind them; everybody goes through a little stall, and they went through a stall last week,'' said Armstead, one of several players in the locker room today despite Fassel's offer for players to take the day off. ''You let the offensive side of the ball handle that situation. Our job's to go out there and stop a team from scoring many points and giving them good position.''</p>
        <p>Sehorn said: ''The last couple of years, we concerned ourselves far more than we needed to concern ourselves, and it didn't get us anywhere. We'll let everybody take care of what they have to take care of and let people who need to be concerned be concerned. Right now, in the definition of being a football player, it doesn't say be concerned, especially about someone else's job.''</p>
        <p>The offense gave early reason for optimism. But since the opening drive of the Giants' victory at Chicago in Week 3, the Giants have scored only five touchdowns in 15 quarters. They are 24th in the National Football League in points per game and 18th in average passing yards. Their 43.8 percent touchdown percentage inside opponents' 20-yard line is fourth worst in the N.F.C.</p>
        <p>Statistically, Dallas should provide a tonic for the offensive woes on Sunday. Cowboys opponents are averaging 29.6 points, second most in the league. Then again, the Falcons were reeling, too.</p>
        <p>Fassel today used words like worried and nervous to describe his feelings about the offense and planned to discuss ways to resuscitate the unit with Payton, who tried a double reverse and a flea flicker at Atlanta. The double reverse worked; the flea flicker failed.</p>
        <p>''It's little things that are turning into big things, missed throws, dropped balls, penalties, assignment errors,'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>One theory, not totally discounted by Fassel or Collins, is that teams have adjusted to Payton's offensive schemes and the Giants have not adjusted in response. But Fassel does not think defenses are predicting the Giants' plays and preferred to blame lack of execution, like missing blocks, dropping passes and overthrowing receivers.</p>
        <p>The running game went from being invisible at Tennessee the previous week, with 24 yards gained, to simply mediocre Sunday. Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne totaled 26 carries but averaged just 3.1 yards a carry, and Fassel said he would address the running game with Payton.</p>
        <p>One difference from last season is tight end Pete Mitchell's diminished role. A knee injury in the first preseason game cost him five weeks of practice and he has struggled to re-enter the offense.</p>
        <p>Another difference is the diminished production of receivers Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard. Each dropped a pass Sunday, and Toomer was called for two pass-interference penalties. Collins said he had not lost faith in either player.</p>
        <p>Fassel said, ''I'm worried about it all right now.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Defensive tackle KEITH HAMILTON was apparently spared a greater injury when he emerged from Sunday's game with a hyperextended right knee. Hamilton left the game in the third quarter after colliding with teammate MICHAEL STRAHAN and did not return. X-rays were negative and Hamilton did not require a magnetic resonance imaging test. Coach JIM FASSEL expected him to play Sunday.</p>
