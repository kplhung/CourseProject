        <p>A condition known as insulin resistance is emerging as yet another risk factor threatening the good health of your heart. And, doctors who focus too narrowly on serum cholesterol may be overlooking this potentially dangerous syndrome, as often happens with high homocysteine levels.</p>
        <p>Concern about insulin resistance is mounting rapidly among cardiovascular specialists as two of its main causes -- obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, and inactivity -- also rise.</p>
        <p>People with the condition have no shortage of insulin, but they fail to use this vital hormone properly. Insulin resistance, or ''syndrome X,'' as one expert calls it, causes up to 25 percent of the heart disease that afflicts men and as much as 60 percent of the heart disease that occurs in women, according to some estimates. If they are correct, the estimates would give insulin resistance the dubious distinction of being the nation's leading underlying cause of heart attacks.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, Dr. Gerald Reaven, an emeritus professor of medicine at Stanford and principal author of the new book ''Syndrome X,'' points out that insulin resistance is a ''silent killer.'' It does not show up in the blood tests usually done at routine medical checkups. Rather, a series of health measurements are required to define it accurately.</p>
        <p>One does not have to be obese or diabetic to have the problem. Dr. Reaven and colleagues found that among people with normal blood pressure who are neither diabetic nor obese about 25 percent to 30 percent are insulin resistant, or a total of 33 million to 40 million Americans, not counting those with high blood pressure or diabetes.</p>
        <p>But while genetics accounts for about half of a person's susceptibility to insulin resistance, the other half can be attributed to obesity, physical inactivity and smoking.</p>
        <p>What Insulin Resistance Is</p>
        <p>When a person eats any food, insulin is released from the pancreas to process it. Insulin's job is to get glucose out of the blood and into the muscle cells that use it for energy. Insulin also inhibits the release of fatty acids from the body's fat stores.</p>
        <p>But in insulin-resistant people, the hormone is less than fully effective at lowering circulating glucose and blocking the release of fatty acids. The pancreas responds by pouring out more insulin in a futile effort to overcome this resistance. The result is a somewhat elevated blood level of glucose and a more serious rise in triglycerides, which are made in the liver from fatty acids in the blood.</p>
        <p>People with syndrome X are especially at risk of developing diabetes and coronary heart disease and may also face an increased risk of suffering a stroke, kidney failure and possibly cancer, according to Dr. Scott Grundy, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, which is leading an international study of the genetics of syndrome X.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Type 2 diabetes, glucose levels in syndrome X, though high, do not rise above normal ranges, so a person would not receive a diagnosis of diabetes. But the syndrome is associated with at least four characteristics that foretell an increased risk of disease and premature death: high blood levels of triglycerides, low levels of protective high-density lipoprotein (H.D.L., or good cholesterol), high blood pressure and glucose intolerance.</p>
        <p>Recent research has linked insulin resistance to other coronary risk factors, including the formation of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (L.D.L.) cholesterol-carrying particles that are especially damaging to arteries, high levels of fat in the blood after eating, high blood levels of uric acid and high levels of a substance, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1, that impairs the body's ability to break up blood clots.</p>
        <p>Getting Checked</p>
        <p>Although elevated blood levels of insulin are characteristic of syndrome X, Dr. Reaven cautions against having one's insulin level checked by an ordinary commercial medical laboratory where measurements and their interpretation vary too much. A more accurate test would include a check of one's fasting level of glucose and response to a two-hour glucose tolerance test. In people with syndrome X, he reports, fasting glucose levels range from 110 to 126 (diabetes is diagnosed when fasting glucose exceeds 126) and two hours into a glucose tolerance test glucose levels are still high, from 140 to 200.</p>
        <p>Fasting levels of triglycerides and H.D.L. cholesterol should also be measured. A triglyceride level above 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood serum and an H.D.L. level under 35 raise the risk of heart disease. Blood pressure should also be checked and, if 145 over 90 or higher, steps should be taken to lower it.</p>
        <p>People should also be weighed and have their waist-to-hip ratios determined. Obesity, especially abdominal fat, is regarded as an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, as well as for diabetes and heart disease.</p>
        <p>What to Do</p>
        <p>You may have heard claims from promoters of popular diets that insulin resistance causes obesity. That claim puts the cart before the horse. Rather, experts say, obesity causes insulin resistance. And weight loss -- even just 10 percent of body fat -- can correct the problem. Weight loss is even more effective than insulin-lowering drugs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Reaven takes issue with popular diet books that focus on carbohydrates as a cause of obesity. Although insulin is released to process carbohydrates and can, at the same time, promote the storage of fat, it does the latter only when more calories are consumed than are used by the body. In other words, it is neither insulin nor carbohydrates that make people fat; it is an excess of calories. And when more calories are consumed than used, it is excess calories from fat that the body places in storage first.</p>
        <p>Dr. Reaven advises insulin-resistant patients to reduce their intake of carbohydrates, particularly sugars and refined starches, which place the highest demands on insulin and are associated with high levels of triglycerides and low levels of H.D.L.'s. Other researchers have shown that unrefined starches, which are rich in dietary fiber, are beneficial to people with Type 2 diabetes and likely would also be helpful to people with insulin resistance.</p>
        <p>In lieu of a carbohydrate-rich diet, Dr. Reaven recommends consuming more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, mainly in the form of nuts and vegetable oils. This is not the Atkins diet, which allows an unlimited intake of saturated fats. The Atkins diet may result in a drop in total cholesterol levels (this happens whenever a person loses weight), but the high level of saturated fats would raise the level of artery-damaging L.D.L. cholesterol.</p>
        <p>Another critical factor in controlling insulin resistance is regular exercise -- at least 30 minutes a day four times a week. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity for up to 48 hours. But ''regular'' is crucial; within days of stopping exercise, the benefits disappear.</p>
