        <p>The Personal Health column, ''For the Vaccine-Wary, a Lesson in History,'' (Oct. 3) missed a crucial lesson about the history of those who have questioned mass vaccination campaigns.</p>
        <p>Those on the skeptical side in the  struggle over vaccines recognize the dangers of infectious disease, and they go out of their way to make it clear that they are not anti-vaccination but rather in favor of improved vaccine safety and informed consent.</p>
        <p>Such skeptics have, for the last 150 years, actually helped promote the safety and effectiveness of vaccines through their insistence on calling attention to the genuine adverse consequences of vaccines, long before doctors have been willing to do so.</p>
        <p>We will all gain when we have a complete dialogue on this issue.</p>
