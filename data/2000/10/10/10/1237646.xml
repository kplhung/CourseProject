        <p>Negotiations for the acquisition of Urbanfetch.com, an online delivery service, by Kozmo.com, a rival, appear to have faltered at the 11th hour, several officials close to the deal said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The difficulties came after agreement had been reached on the framework for a deal, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Kozmo executives have questioned the health of Urbanfetch, arguing that its finances were misrepresented during last-minute negotiations, executives close to Kozmo said. One Urbanfetch official acknowledged that the talks had stalled, but said the reason for the delay had to do with wrangling over legal issues.</p>
        <p>''The deal is far from being done and there are many important issues that need to be resolved; there is even a chance that the deal will not go through,'' said one executive close to Kozmo.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time talks between the two companies have stalled since negotiations began in late summer. But this seems to represent the most serious obstacle, executives said. Last week, officials said that the deal could come together as early as this week.</p>
        <p>Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Kozmo, declined to discuss the state of the talks, as did Lisa Schechter, a spokeswoman for Urbanfetch.</p>
        <p>While the exact terms of the tentative agreement were not divulged, the executives said that it would be done entirely in stock. Neither company is publicly traded, so Kozmo would pay Urbanfetch in private equity by giving it -- and its investors -- a percentage of ownership in a combined company. If the market for Internet initial public offerings turns up again, the new company will go public within the next year, the executives added.</p>
        <p>Kozmo, the larger of the two, is based in New York and operates in 11 cities: Atlanta; Boston; Washington; Chicago; Houston; Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; San Diego; San Francisco; Seattle; and parts of Manhattan. Urbanfetch, also based in New York, operates in London, Manhattan and Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>In addition to consolidating, Kozmo officials hoped to gain access to Urbanfetch's customer database and entree into markets, like Brooklyn, that their company had not yet penetrated. Urbanfetch has also shown a better ability to market high-ticket items.</p>
        <p>Last week, lawyers from both sides were trying to resolve what ownership stake Urbanfetch's investors would take in the new company. But several executives said that Kozmo's senior management became concerned by the middle of the week.</p>
        <p>The deal was so close that on Wednesday, Gerry Burdo, Kozmo's  president and acting chief executive, visited Urbanfetch's London headquarters to review the company's books.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burdo stayed in London through Friday, even playing a game of golf with bankers negotiating the deal and top Urbanfetch executives. A draft news release had been written. Urbanfetch is scheduled to have a party Thursday evening for the introduction of its wine delivery service.</p>
        <p>But executives close to the deal said that Mr. Burdo and other Kozmo officials became concerned after reviewing Urbanfetch's finances.</p>
        <p>None of the executives would detail Kozmo's concerns, other than to say that they related to Urbanfetch's finances. A confidentiality agreement bars anyone involved in the deal from discussing the details of either of the company's balance sheets, the executives said.</p>
        <p>An executive close to Urbanfetch said that the deal was stalled over ''several legal issues,'' revolving around voting rights for the venture capitalists who invested early in Urbanfetch and Kozmo. ''If the legal stuff could get figured out, we'd have a deal.''</p>
        <p>But one executive close to Kozmo said that ''the issue is: what is Urbanfetch worth?'' and increasing distrust among those involved in the discussions.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Urbanfetch officials said they were taken aback by suggestions that the deal hinged on serious financial problems. ''We've never heard them tell us anything about a cash flow problem before,'' said one Urbanfetch executive. ''They clearly have an agenda.''</p>
