        <p>Caradon, a British maker of building and home improvement products, said it would sell its plumbing businesses to HSBC Private Equity for $:442 million, or about $639 million, in cash as it focuses on more profitable businesses. The division, which includes brands like Ideal Boilers and Twyford Bathrooms, accounted for nearly one-third of the company's sales last year, but only a quarter of profits. Caradon, which is changing its name to Novar, said it would use the proceeds to pay down debt.</p>
