        <p>The Mets and Cardinals both have had a few days to prepare for tomorrow's start of the National League Championship Series. With the teams seeming to be evenly matched, Tyler Kepner analyzes their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p>METS  94-68, N.L. wild- card winner  vs  St. Louis  95-67, N.L. Central champion</p>
        <p>Season series: Mets won 6 of 9</p>
        <p>PITCHING</p>
        <p>Without question, this is the Mets' biggest strength. They have confidence in all five starting pitchers, and the relievers were nasty in the division series victory against San Francisco. The Mets' bullpen allowed only two earned runs to the Giants in 1123 innings (a 1.54 earned run average), and both of those runs were charged to Armando Benitez, who redeemed himself with two overpowering innings in Game 2. Benitez still has postseason demons to overcome -- he has allowed seven postseason homers in 2413 innings -- but none of the Cardinals have ever homered off him. The Mets' staff will be rested, with Al Leiter, Rick Reed and Bobby J. Jones coming off strong starts in the division series and Mike Hampton looking to rebound after one bad inning sank his first-round start.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals wrapped up their division series on Saturday afternoon and start this round tomorrow night, giving them essentially four days to rest their staff. The Cards' offense so pounded the Braves' starters that the relievers were not severely tested in the first round, but the St. Louis bullpen did a good job when called on. Six Cardinals relievers had a 1.32 E.R.A. over 1323 innings, with Mike Timlin allowing the only two runs in a blowout victory in Game 2. The Cardinals' bullpen received a makeover after a weekend sweep by the Mets in May, with Timlin and Jason Christiansen coming over in trades and Matt Morris coming back from an injury. Britt Reames, a rookie, and the veteran Mike James came up big against Atlanta.</p>
        <p>OFFENSE</p>
        <p>It's nothing against Derek Bell, who played hard all season and never let his wildly inconsistent offensive production affect his defense, but Bell's injury in the division series settled the Mets' lineup. Timo Perez gives the Mets a leadoff presence they did not have for most of the season, and putting Edgardo Alfonzo back in the No. 2 hole that he occupied last season was an inspired decision. Perez and Alfonzo teamed up in run-scoring rallies in the second and fourth games against the Giants, and if Mike Piazza starts swinging better, the Mets could really be on to something. Piazza was a nonfactor on offense in the Giants' series (.214, no runs batted in), but the Cardinals are the perfect team to cure him: Piazza is a .380 lifetime hitter against Darryl Kile, Pat Hentgen, Andy Benes and Matt Morris. One other important hitter the Mets must get going: Todd Zeile, who has been dropped to the No. 7 spot after going 2 for 29 in his last nine games.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals received good news this week, but it means nothing for this series: Mark McGwire thinks his injured knee may be well enough for him to be a designated hitter in the World Series. For now, McGwire is simply baseball's most fearsome pinch-hitter, although he is awful in his career against the Mets' relievers. Armando Benitez, Dennis Cook, John Franco and Turk Wendell have limited McGwire to one single in 25 career at-bats. Then again, some of the Cardinals' regulars have pounded the Mets' starters, notably Mike Hampton. Eric Davis, J. D. Drew, Placido Polanco, Fernando Tatis and Fernando Vina all have career averages above .400 against Hampton. Jim Edmonds and Will Clark drive this offense, but both hit better against right-handed pitching than left-handers, with Clark hitting just .248 off lefties.</p>
        <p>DEFENSE</p>
        <p>Lost in the drama of the Game 2 comeback, Benny Agbayani's Game 3 homer and Jones's Game 4 one-hitter was the consistent play of the Mets' defense, which committed no errors in the division series. Perez's aggressiveness in right field is part of what makes him a dynamic player, but it nearly cost him in Game 3, when he made a risky throw trying to throw out Marvin Benard, who was retreating to first base after Perez made a catch. Joe McEwing will continue to replace Agbayani on defense in the late innings of games the Mets lead, as he did in Game 4. Giants base runners gave Piazza a break, attempting only two steals (both successful) on the Mets' catcher.</p>
        <p>Edmonds is a magician on defense in center field, with an uncanny ability to read balls and take the correct angle, compensating for only average speed. Shortstop Edgar Renteria led National League shortstops with 27 errors, and Renteria made the team's only error in its three-game sweep of the Braves. The Cardinals feared the loss of Mike Matheny, who threw out more than half of all would-be base stealers but is out for the postseason after accidentally slicing his finger with a hunting knife. But Carlos Hernandez -- the Padres' regular catcher in the 1998 World Series -- has been a solid replacement. The Braves tried to steal four times against Hernandez, but were successful only once.</p>
        <p>ON THE BASES</p>
        <p>Lenny Harris is a spiritual leader on the Mets, firing up teammates with his energy on the bench. But he also shows his leadership in more tangible ways, especially on the bases. Harris is 5-foot-10, 220 pounds, but he is a good base stealer because of his knowledge of the game. Harris was successful on 13 of 14 stolen-base attempts this year, and with two outs in the eighth inning of Game 3 and the Mets down by a run, he stole second on the first pitch by Robb Nen, the Giants' reliever. That put Harris in scoring position, and he promptly came home on a double by Alfonzo. Perez and Jay Payton also have speed, but not experience, and Valentine will use McEwing and Kurt Abbott as pinch-runners, as well.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals have functional speed and are no longer a station-to-station team, but they are not really a base-stealing team, although it was hard to tell that on Sept. 1, when the first three Cardinals to reach first base all attempted steals on Mike Piazza and pitcher Bobby J. Jones, who can be slow to the plate. All three beat Piazza's throw -- although Ray Lankford slid over the base and was tagged out -- but speed ended up not playing much of a factor in that series, which the Cardinals swept. Renteria and J.D. Drew stole 38 bases between them, but were caught 21 times. ''It is an element of St. Louis's attack that has a greater presence than what San Francisco had,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said.</p>
        <p>X-FACTOR</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine thrives on matchups with other managers, and in the Cardinals' Tony La Russa, he has an adversary with a lofty reputation. Valentine made a series of decisions that paid off against San Francisco -- moving Alfonzo to second and Agbayani to fifth in the batting order, keeping McEwing on the roster, starting Jones in Game 4 -- proving the difference a manager can make in October.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals won't need to sell the Mets on the talent of Rick Ankiel, the rookie left-hander. The 21-year-old allowed only two hits and one run in seven innings on Sept. 3, the only time he faced the Mets this year. Ankiel threw five wild pitches in one inning in Game 1 of the Cardinals-Braves division series, but his stuff is outstanding. If Ankiel starts twice in this series and has his command, he could make a difference.</p>
