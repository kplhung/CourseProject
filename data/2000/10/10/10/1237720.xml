        <p>Shares of Eidos, the British video game maker that created the animated hero Lara Croft, fell 39.5 pence, or 13.4 percent, to 255 pence, after the company said it had terminated merger discussions with an unnamed party, because the price was too low. In June, Eidos said it was in early negotiations that might lead to an offer for the company.
