        <p>Four years ago, Idelma Diaz O'Rourke moved to this suburb overlooking the George Washington Bridge for the same reason as many others. She and her husband liked the small city's proximity to Manhattan, its ethnic diversity, its graceful mix of wealthy neighborhoods and tidy, affordable homes.</p>
        <p>When they arrived with two small children, Mrs. O'Rourke asked neighbors for advice on schools, a major reason many families move to the suburbs.</p>
        <p>''Everyone told me, 'Oh, go to such and such private school,' '' Mrs. O'Rourke said. ''Nobody even mentioned the public schools as an option, because they were so bad.''</p>
        <p>So the O'Rourkes did what many here with the means do: they sent their children to private school. Now, with three children and faced with the prospect of mounting private school tuition, Mrs. O'Rourke recently found herself wondering why a wealthy town with a high property-tax base settled for schools that were so inadequate that 40 percent of school-age children attend private schools.</p>
        <p>Those who can afford it stay away from the Englewood district, they say, because its test scores rank near the bottom in Bergen County. The district has also been embroiled for 15 years in a costly legal battle to keep a well-to-do neighboring community, Englewood Cliffs, from pulling its students -- most of them white -- out of Englewood High School, which is a disproportionate 97 percent nonwhite, and placing them in another nearby public school.</p>
        <p>Lack of money does not appear to be the problem; spending per pupil here is higher than the state average. And Englewood, a suburb of 24,850 residents, is a city of opulent homes and famously successful residents, like the actor Eddie Murphy and the investment banker Orin Kramer. So wealthy are the town's residents that Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman have been here recently for fund-raisers held by residents with deep pockets.</p>
        <p>Mrs. O'Rourke and several of her neighbors decided the situation had to change. They gathered more than 1,000 signatures on a petition and forced the city to place a measure on the November ballot asking voters if they wanted to change the seven-member school board from one appointed by the mayor to an elected one. ''I said to myself, 'You know what, I'm going to try to get involved and make a change instead of moving away like a lot of people,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>The group says the district's poor academic performance is directly tied to its leadership. ''The system is at fault,'' says its literature, ''and the political appointees who have been running this disaster for years are the problem.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. O'Rourke said that her group had no particular educational philosophy in mind to solve the district's problems, but that they were confident that an elected board accountable to the voters would respond more to public demands for change.</p>
        <p>''Parent involvement is the key issue,'' she said. ''Now there is no parent involvement because they feel shut out of the whole system.''</p>
        <p>In the early 1980's, there was an effort to change the school board to an elected one, but it failed amid strong opposition from City Hall. So proponents of the measure this time know they have a tough fight on their hands. The mayor, Paul T. Fader, has already said he would work hard against them.</p>
        <p>As they prepare to do battle with the city's political establishment, proponents of the measure must also counter arguments -- even from those outside Englewood -- that a change in who selects the school board may not be the solution to what ails the schools.</p>
        <p>''Our position is that there is no correlation between the success of a school district and whether a school board is elected or appointed,'' said Michael Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yaple said that Englewood was one of 19 school districts in the state whose members were appointed by the mayors. Those districts range from large urban communities like Trenton to medium-size ones like Montclair and Summit to small shore communities like Sea Isle and Brigantine. In the other 562 districts in the state, board members are elected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yaple said that two other districts would vote in November on whether to change their systems. In Elizabeth, where voters have selected the school board only since 1988, the City Council wants to return to an appointed board. In New Brunswick, the board is appointed, and a referendum will ask voters if they want to elect the board instead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yaple said that a school district's academic performance and fiscal soundness did not seem to be tied to how the board was chosen. ''If a school district is experiencing some problems, it's probably due to some other issues,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Philip E. Mackey, author of the recently published book ''New Jersey's Public Schools 2000,'' (Rutgers University Press) said that failing schools usually do so for myriad reasons, least of which is how a district is governed.</p>
        <p>''The idea that this is the cure to what ails them is hard to buy,'' he cautioned. ''What do they expect that a new board is going to do that hasn't been done already?''</p>
        <p>But he said there has been a trend in recent years to switch to elected boards -- 13 in New Jersey have changed to elected from appointed ones since 1983 -- because taxpayers prefer to have the power to vote for school board members and the budgets they propose.</p>
        <p>In Englewood's government, the mayor's power rests primarily in his ability to appoint boards, such as the school board and the planning board, all of which have large sway in hiring and building. He can vote on the City Council only when there is a tie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fader, who was elected in 1997, said that in a town with such diversity in income and race, appointing the board was the only means of to ensuring true representation of all ethnic groups in the city.  He also pointed to improvements the schools have made in test scores in the last two years.</p>
        <p>''No one on this group is articulating the basis of what they want to do differently in terms of educating children,'' he said. ''What I find disappointing is that many of those who want to change things have never set foot in the public schools, and all they want to do is cut the budget.''</p>
        <p>But those who support the measure say it is evident that something is wrong with the school system. Englewood's eighth graders scored second to lowest of 74 Bergen County schools in a state proficiency exam in the 1998-99 school year, and Englewood High had the worst SAT scores of the county's 45 high schools in 1998. Dissatisfaction with the schools has been mounting, critics say, as residents have realized that a poorly performing school system drives down property values.</p>
        <p>Norman Gorlyn, who has lived here since 1972, sent his children public schools before switching to parochial schools. ''There are four families I know of who left my neighborhood recently,'' he said. ''If they can't swing private school, they pull out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorlyn, who retired as treasurer of the New York State Housing Finance Agency, was part of the group that organized the effort to put the school board measure on the ballot. He said that he expected strong opposition from the mayor and the Council.</p>
        <p>''When you have a board sitting on $39 million, you don't want to give up that power,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Englewood has 12 private schools, some of them parochial schools for the city's large number of Orthodox Jews.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, a charter school was opened in the city after considerable opposition from city and school officials. The city said that the independently operated but taxpayer-supported charter school would drain the district's education dollars. Charter schools, created by state law, are entitled to 90 percent of the funding that other public schools receive.</p>
        <p>After the city and the school district challenged its certificate of occupancy, its teachers' credentials and the racial makeup of its student body, the Englewood on the Palisades Charter School opened in the fall of 1998. Now it has 80 students in kindergarten through grade 4, said Paul Raynault, one of its founders.</p>
        <p>''If they disagree with you, they will spend thousands of dollars to try to defeat you,'' he said of City Hall.</p>
        <p>Michael Wildes, a councilman, has supported putting the school board question on the ballot, although he said he had not decided yet whether to vote for it. He said an appointed board could be more representative of Englewood's diversity.</p>
        <p>''There are factions out there that believe we will have more prejudice and a board of education of the elite were this election effort to succeed,'' he said. ''The mayor can make sure the board is representative of everyone. Of course, that has not led to the betterment of the education of our children here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fader, however, points to improvements in the schools since the board hired Dr. Joyce Baynes as superintendent two years ago. Test scores are up slightly, Dwight Morris High School became a magnet school intended to attract students from Englewood Cliffs and other communities, and a program was created for troubled students, he said.</p>
        <p>''Children are learning, and the atmosphere is positive now,'' said Mr. Fader, who said he sends his two children to public schools here. ''The best thing to do is to keep the politics out of it, and to give these improvements time to work.''</p>
