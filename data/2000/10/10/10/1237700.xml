        <p>Pluramon  Knitting Factory</p>
        <p>Physically, there's not much to the band Pluramon: for the most part, it lives inside the hard drive of the young German electronic composer Marcus Schmickler. But to take Pluramon on the road for a short tour these past few weeks, Mr. Schmickler also brought his guitar and a drummer, Jochen Rueckert.</p>
        <p>If Pluramon is more an idea than a band, the idea is this: it combines rock with the new abstract, beatless, texture-mad electronic art made and performed on Macintosh G3's that you could call laptop music. You'd think such a mixture would have been discovered and done to death; the audience for the new electronic music is the same audience, with the same ears, that loved alternative rock 10 years ago. But Mr. Schmickler got there early, in the mid-90's, and the two worlds basically stay apart; that was demonstrable even last Tuesday night, when the big crowd that had come to see Kid 606 -- a more purely electronic act -- dissipated a few minutes into Pluramon's instrumental set.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmickler uses both halves of his combination fairly equally. He peered into his laptop and produced a flow of hailstorm-pinging carillon bell sounds. He worked over slow, repeating riffs and chords on his guitar, and Mr. Rueckert played drum accompaniment, guided by a click-track in his headphones.</p>
        <p>It began a little dryly -- there was no improvisation going on here -- but Mr. Schmickler is after a particular rhythmic sound that after a while loosens up whatever it's accompanying.</p>
