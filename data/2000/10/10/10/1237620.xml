        <p>THERE'S the bull market, and the bear market. And then there's Bob Evans Farms.</p>
        <p>The Columbus, Ohio, company, which owns a chain of restaurants and a sausage-making business, has been a target of shareholder wrath for its stagnant stock price, at $17 to $18, nearly unchanged since 1985. Annual meetings, centered on a picnic at the family farm where the original Bob Evans got his start, have turned hostile, with investors demanding explanations from management, and management, in their string ties, all but turning off the microphone.</p>
        <p>For obvious reasons, no one seems eager to sell, particularly the largest shareholder, which owns nearly 20 percent. And with restaurant and food stocks generally ignored by Wall Street, few investors seem compelled to buy.</p>
        <p>''It used to be perceived as a neat little growth company,'' said William Leach, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and a shareholder himself. Now, ''it's the only stock I follow that sells at a lower price today than it did 20 years ago.''</p>
        <p>This year, some shareholders became especially irate when, they said, they did not get their proxy statements in time to vote them at the meeting. Included on the ballot were three resolutions that could have meant big changes at the company, now run by Daniel E. Evans, the chairman, who is a cousin of the founder, and Stewart K. Owens, a Texas sausage-maker whose company was acquired by Bob Evans Farms in the 1980's and who has been president, chief operating officer and chief executive since April.</p>
        <p>One resolution, proposed by Lawrence Wolf, a Delta Air Lines pilot who has owned a few thousand shares since childhood, would force all nine directors to face re-election every year. Another, from E. Kay Mitchell of Pepper Pike, Ohio, would eliminate stock options, bonuses and restricted shares for management, calling them ''a raid on corporate assets.''</p>
        <p>And a third called for the company to be sold to the highest bidder. That proposal came from Bob Evans's daughter, Deborrah A. Donskov of Westerville, Ohio.</p>
        <p>After the Sept. 11 meeting, Bob Evans Farms put out a press release saying all three resolutions had been defeated. But some shareholders have questioned whether the late arrival of their proxies was accidental or was orchestrated by management.</p>
        <p>John Vaneria, a Manhattan lawyer who represents several shareholders who did not receive proxies until Aug. 24, filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sept. 13. He asserts that the failure to get the proxies out in plenty of time, together with a statement the company made to him that proxies received less than 10 days before the annual meeting are not binding, constituted ''a pattern on the part of Evans management to effectively deny public shareholders the right to vote their securities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vaneria has since received a letter from the S.E.C. saying it had requested information from Bob Evans Farms, and the company confirmed that it got the S.E.C. letter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens said in a telephone interview that most proxies were mailed by Aug. 10, and the rest by Aug. 16. At the meeting, 82 percent of the shares were voted and counted, he added, which is typical.</p>
        <p>''We did not get a single question raised at our annual meeting about proxies being late,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The biggest shareholder seems to think everything is under control. ''We're really confident in Dan Evans and Stewart and the management team,'' said John Miller, an analyst with Ariel Capital Management, the Chicago investment company that began buying shares 10 years ago, and now owns 7 million of them, or about 20 percent of the company. ''We spend a lot of time visiting the restaurants and talking to their customers,'' he said. ''They pay a lot of attention to service and food quality, and they are not going to let up on those two issues.''</p>
        <p>But other investors are complaining. Mr. Wolf, the pilot, has become a kind of folk hero for his call for annual re-election of directors, which he has proposed two years running. Last month, the proposal got 43 percent of the votes cast.</p>
        <p>The first year, he said, management tried to stop him when he urged shareholders to vote for it. ''They were very rude,'' he recalled. ''They tried to cut me off and didn't want to give me my three minutes.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the company, Mary Cusick, recalled it a little differently. ''When Larry Wolf got up, he started a commentary and it was off the topic,'' she said. Referring to Mr. Owens, she continued: ''Stewart had asked for a motion on the resolution, and asked him to hold off till after he'd made the motion and gotten a second.''</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Wolf said, he has received stacks of letters from dissatisfied shareholders. ''I object to the almost $4 million bonus paid to the five leading executive officers,'' wrote Vernon E. Young, from New Carlisle, Ohio, last fall. ''I have yet to see the basis of the bonus payments.''</p>
        <p>Another shareholder, John D. Martin, a missionary stationed in Nairobi, Kenya, added in an August letter: ''I was amazed at the number of top executives that are making what I consider excessive salaries and bonuses.''</p>
        <p>The company's proxy shows that in fiscal 2000, which ended in April, cash bonuses paid to the top executives declined considerably. Mr. Owens's bonus was $85,247 this year, down from $300,708 last year, though his salary rose to $389,225 from $284,400. Still, this year he also received 79,076 stock options, at a strike price of $19.375 -- up from 14,150 in 1999.</p>
        <p>Among those who voted in favor of all three resolutions was Bob Evans himself, now 82. It was the first time he had played an active role since retiring 14 years ago.</p>
        <p>A few days later, Mr. Evans called Mr. Owens. ''He told me he agreed with the shareholder proposal to declassify the board,'' Mr. Owens said, ''but that he did not agree with his daughter's proposal to sell the company or the proposal to eliminate stock options and bonuses. I said, 'Well, Bob, didn't you say you voted for those proposals?' He said, 'Yes I did.' I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Well, I guess I was just mad.' '' It was the first time the two had spoken, Mr. Owens added, in more than a year.</p>
        <p>Reached by telephone, Bob Evans said he did not necessarily want to sell the company -- ''My daughter promotes that thing'' -- but he did think it would be best if the directors were elected annually. ''It's healthier for everybody,'' he explained. ''If you have a bad director, you have trouble getting rid of him.'' Mr. Evans said he got a call or a letter nearly every day, asking him to ''do something about Bob Evans,'' the company.</p>
        <p>Improving the share price seems to be a chief concern for Mr. Owens. ''We don't feel that our company or our industry are getting proper credit for the work we've been doing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A perennial worry is the price of hogs, a main ingredient in the sausage products the company sells through supermarkets. While the restaurant business has been relatively steady, hog prices have fluctuated wildly, Mr. Leach of Donaldson, Lufkin said. ''Honestly, they would be better off if they just sold the food business and kept the restaurants,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That does not fit with Mr. Owens's strategy. ''The food side is among the best-performing businesses that we've got,'' he said. ''It has the best return on equity and throws off a ton of cash.'' The company's debt, he added, has been taken on recently as part of a share-repurchase program, intended to lift returns for shareholders. Unlike the stock price, earnings have grown over time. In 1990, the company earned 65 cents a share, and this year analysts expect it to earn $1.50. In recent years, earnings have grown by double-digit rates, except for last year, when they declined 0.7 percent.</p>
        <p>The strategy could work over time. Right now, some shareholders say they are not sure the company is looking out for their interests.</p>
        <p>''Margaret Thatcher once said there's a thin veneer of civilization over England, and it's the same thing on Wall Street,'' Mr. Vaneria, the lawyer, said. ''If management can just rake the shareholders over the coals and get away with it, it doesn't augur well for public investment in American companies.''</p>
