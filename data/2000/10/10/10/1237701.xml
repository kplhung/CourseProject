        <p>Justine Frischmann made her reputation on a sneer, but she smirked and sometimes even smiled through Elastica's Wednesday night show. The frontwoman for this English punk band is a natural star who looked great and sounded better posing in the video for ''Connection,'' a switchblade-sharp song that made Elastica leaders in the New British Invasion of the mid-1990's. But five years of personal and band turmoil left Elastica behind the trends, and its resurrection isn't being attended by major hype. That's fine with Ms. Frischmann, and as the band's loose, frolicsome show indicated, even better for her music.</p>

        <p>Elastica  Bowery Ballroom</p>
        <p>Justine Frischmann made her reputation on a sneer, but she smirked and sometimes even smiled through Elastica's Wednesday night show. The frontwoman for this English punk band is a natural star who looked great and sounded better posing in the video for ''Connection,'' a switchblade-sharp song that made Elastica leaders in the New British Invasion of the mid-1990's. But five years of personal and band turmoil left Elastica behind the trends, and its resurrection isn't being attended by major hype. That's fine with Ms. Frischmann, and as the band's loose, frolicsome show indicated, even better for her music.</p>
        <p>The songs from the new album,  ''Menace'' (Atlantic), and somewhat retooled ones from the group's 1995 debut stuck together in a big enjoyable mess of ragged guitar chords and reeling keyboards. ''Don't touch me, I'm obsessed with Wire!'' Ms. Frischmann howled in the band's goofy cover of the Talking Heads song ''Psycho Killer,'' referring to another of the pioneering punk bands to which she swears loyalty.</p>
        <p>The bassist Annie Holland and the drummer Justin Welch gave Elastica a secure base upon which to wreak havoc, while the keyboardist Dave Bush (formerly of the Fall, another band Ms. Frischmann adores) and the guitarist Paul Jones did the heavy demolition work.</p>
        <p>Ms. Frischmann herself still projected a cool sexiness, but in a heavy metal T-shirt and drooping jeans she wasn't working at it. Her new onstage sparring partner was the keyboardist and co-vocalist Mew, a veritable punk sprite who spent more time tossing herself around than playing her instrument.</p>
