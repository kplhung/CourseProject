        <p>It may look like business as usual in the dance world, but things are decidedly in flux. The Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow appointed a new artistic director, Boris Akimov, over the weekend to replace Aleksei Fadeyechev, and the Boston Ballet announced recently that Maina Gielgud will succeed Anna-Marie Holmes as artistic director next July.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holmes, however, has just given her final season a fresh start with a program of premieres. Christopher Wheeldon, principal guest choreographer, created his own version of ''The Four Seasons'' to Vivaldi's score; Daniel Pelzig, previously the company's resident choreographer and now a guest choreographer, used Walt Whitman's harrowing poem about the Civil War, ''The Wound Dresser,'' as springboard for his elegiac ''Resurrection,'' set to Samuel Barber's Concerto for Cello and Orchestra.</p>

        <p>It may look like business as usual in the dance world, but things are decidedly in flux. The Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow appointed a new artistic director, Boris Akimov, over the weekend to replace Aleksei Fadeyechev, and the Boston Ballet announced recently that Maina Gielgud will succeed Anna-Marie Holmes as artistic director next July.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holmes, however, has just given her final season a fresh start with a program of premieres. Christopher Wheeldon, principal guest choreographer, created his own version of ''The Four Seasons'' to Vivaldi's score; Daniel Pelzig, previously the company's resident choreographer and now a guest choreographer, used Walt Whitman's harrowing poem about the Civil War, ''The Wound Dresser,'' as springboard for his elegiac ''Resurrection,'' set to Samuel Barber's Concerto for Cello and Orchestra.</p>
        <p>The two pieces, seen on Saturday afternoon at the Wang Theater here, were different in sensibility. Neither was major. Yet each had inspired moments, raising these admirable essays above a level of craft.</p>
        <p>In contrast to this bill of new works, Ms. Holmes will soon (Oct. 19-29) present her staging of Marius Petipa's 19th-century classic ''La Bayadere.'' This balance of old and new has visibly raised the level of dancing at the Boston Ballet. Mr. Wheeldon, who is also resident choreographer this year at New York City Ballet's new Choreographic Institute, specializes in a fast-moving neo-Classical style that the Boston women, at least, mastered easily. The men stood out in Mr. Pelzig's energetic blend of ballet bravura and modern-dance floor work in ''Resurrection.''</p>
        <p>Versatility is not necessarily a virtue unto itself in a ballet troupe. But the Boston Ballet has increased its range. Under its founder, E. Virginia Williams, it was once considered a Balanchine satellite company. Under Bruce Marks, Ms. Holmes began to stage 19th-century Russian classics with the help of dancers and former directors of the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad. The Boston Ballet's superb ''Swan Lake'' is one of the few traditional versions on the boards, blissfully free of psychological twists.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holmes, who became artistic director in 1997, then staged ''Le Corsaire'' with the help of Sergei Berejnoi and Tatyana Terekhova, who are former Kirov stars and ballet masters for the Boston troupe. Since Mr. Fadeyechev had engaged them for the Bolshoi next year, their future is now in doubt.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, they have helped Ms. Holmes with ''La Bayadere.'' If all of the above sounds like a digression, the point is that Petipa classics are the touchstones of classical dancing, and performing them has improved the company's technique.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wheeldon is an obvious beneficiary. Classical footwork is at the base of his choreography no matter how lighthearted his images are in this premiere. Like other choreographers attracted by Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons,'' conducted here with brio by Jonathan McPhee with Michael Rosenbloom as the violin soloist, he equates each season with a musical equivalent.</p>
        <p>And like Jerome Robbins, who used music by Verdi in ''The Seasons,'' he grounds his images in jokes. These have a certain charm, aided by Santo Loquasto's Disney esque style in the decor: a suspended wreath with snow falling on a blue slope. Cutout clouds recall the sets of 18th-century royal theaters.</p>
        <p>This idea fits the Baroque music, which does not have the bombastic effect of the Robbins version. Nonetheless it is facile charm, not just charm, that defines Mr. Wheeldon's ballet. His ensembles, especially in the symmetry of the first, ''Spring'' section led by the vivacious and precise Pollyana Ribeiro and the elegant Christopher Budzynski, strain for a grandeur that he reins in.</p>
        <p>Yet there is an English springtime freshness about the whole scene, with its daisy chains, its maypole allusions and the frequent curve of an arm, raised in Royal Ballet style.</p>
        <p>The first and last sections were the best, partly because Mr. Wheeldon was at his deepest in the duets. Ms. Ribeiro had some inventive lifts up her partner's back, and Jennifer Gelfand was delightful as the mosquito victimizing Reagan Messer amid the swimmers diving down to the floor or down a ramp in ''Summer.'' ''Fall'' brought in Sarah Lamb as the town tease, with the town dancing on carts that looked like flatbed trucks. In ''Winter,'' with its duet for Larissa Ponomarenko, elegant in her silvery lyricism, and a noble Simon Ball, Mr. Wheeldon moved up to a higher plane. Throughout the ballet, and amid all the cliches, there was the unexpected combination of steps.</p>
        <p>In ''Resurrection,'' Mr. Pelzig started with a cliche, the image of dying men and consoling women, and did something admirable, increasing the intensity of emotion as he went along. Barber's music, with Kevin Crudder as the cello soloist, has its own emotional resonance. Mr. Pelzig's choreography looked occasionally too busy, but he did not blindly follow the score.</p>
        <p>Nor did he limit himself to Walt Whitman's war protest. Loy Arcenas's stunning backdrop (part American flag and part craggy rock under James F. Ingalls's lighting) set the tone. Mr. Pelzig's plotless panorama of angelic women on toe and flying men, athletic or with bodies in fragmented movement, spoke of death's effect on a larger scale. His ghostly images evoked memories that should not recede.</p>
