        <p>The Mets figured there would be a historical backdrop to this year's National League Championship Series, if they made it that far.

        <p>The St. Louis Cardinals are not the rival the Mets expected to draw. The Mets are meeting their 1980's sparring partner, the team that fought so hard with them in the Keith Hernandez-Gary Carter years.

        <p>The Mets figured there would be a historical backdrop to this year's National League Championship Series, if they made it that far. What they did not think was that the history would be from the 1980's, and it would involve players named Ozzie Smith and Willie McGee -- not John Rocker and Chipper Jones.</p>
        <p>The St. Louis Cardinals are not the rival the Mets expected to draw. The Mets are meeting their 1980's sparring partner, the team that fought so hard with them in the Keith Hernandez-Gary Carter years. The Atlanta Braves, gatekeepers of the World Series for the last decade and recent tormentors of the Mets, are done.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals swept the Braves in the division series and will play host to the Mets tomorrow night at Busch Stadium at the start of the four-of-seven-game N.L.C.S. The Mets, who eliminated the San Francisco Giants, three games to one, took yesterday off and will fly to St. Louis today for a late workout. It is a new destination -- and an unusual feeling.</p>
        <p>''It certainly is different,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said. ''Others may say it's not, but it is different. But it's not one of overconfidence, by any means. I'm confident we'll play well, but I'm also confident they'll play well. We'll have to make the big plays and key pitches to win.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying it's any easier, but it does feel different.''</p>
        <p>The Mets do not have to contend with their own mental demons about beating the Braves, who outlasted them in the six-game N.L.C.S. last October. When the Cardinals make an unexpected big play or the Mets make a mistake, there will be no feeling of ''Here we go again.'' The Mets and Cardinals both have positive recent history to consider.</p>
        <p>The Mets are 26-10 against the Cardinals since 1997, and they swept St. Louis on the road in May and at Shea Stadium in July. But the Cardinals swept the Mets at Busch Stadium in September, winning all three games in their last at-bat.</p>
        <p>''We've just got to find a way to get the magic back from when we played them early,'' Mets outfielder Darryl Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals will start Darryl Kile (20-9 in the regular season) in Game 1, followed by the 21-year-old rookie left-hander Rick Ankiel (11-7) in Game 2 on Thursday. In the third game, at Shea at 4:18 p.m. on Saturday, Andy Benes (12-9) gets the call.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals' right-hander Garrett Stephenson (16-9) is out for the rest of the postseason because of elbow tendinitis.</p>
        <p>The Mets made no announcements yesterday about the makeup of their N.L.C.S. roster or their rotation. Manager Bobby Valentine said he wanted to wait until after he got on the Mets' three-hour flight today, when he will discuss his options with his coaching staff.</p>
        <p>''There will be plenty of time to talk,'' he said. ''I like to keep an open mind. It's easy for me to make a decision when I've got all the information.''</p>
        <p>Phillips said the decisions were Valentine's; he could be persuaded in whatever direction Valentine wanted. But in explaining the Mets' options, Phillips outlined the advantages of replacing right fielder Derek Bell, who is out for the postseason with a high right ankle sprain, with the long reliever Pat Mahomes.</p>
        <p>The Mets carried 10 pitchers in the division series, with the fifth starter Glendon Rusch working out of the bullpen.</p>
        <p>But Valentine put Rusch in the bullpen not so much to use him as a long man, but to give the Mets a second left-hander -- with Dennis Cook -- in the innings before the veteran left-hander John Franco pitches. Mahomes would be valuable insurance in case a starter is knocked out early or a game goes deep into extra innings.</p>
        <p>''I think we're going to have to consider it,'' Phillips said of adding Mahomes. ''It seems like there's a pattern forming for us with extra-inning games in the postseason. That's something we have to take into account.</p>
        <p>''All you know is there are going to be close games. How do we manage it? We don't want to get caught short. You plan for the long term, and it's something we at least have to keep in mind.''</p>
        <p>With a seven-game format in the N.L.C.S. -- as opposed to the five-game format for the first round -- Mahomes thinks there is a good chance he will make it.</p>
        <p>''That's what I thought they were going to do,'' Mahomes said, who has not yet been told of his status. ''I'm definitely hoping that.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets choose to stay with 10 pitchers, Phillips said they could add the rookie catcher Vance Wilson to the roster. That would allow the Mets to use Todd Pratt as a pinch-hitter, which they are hesitant to do without another backup for the starting catcher, Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>Matt Franco, a left-handed hitter who played in 101 games this year, does not seem likely to make the team. Franco is versatile and has Valentine's trust, but the Mets already have two experienced left-handed hitters off the bench.</p>
        <p>''With Lenny Harris, we have a guy that can play the infield and outfield, and Darryl Hamilton can play the outfield as well,'' Phillips said. ''We're covered there.''</p>
        <p>The Mets seem likely to start Mike Hampton in Game 1 and Al Leiter in Game 2; that was the arrangement in the division series, and both pitchers can be used on full rest. Hampton said Sunday that he wanted to pitch Game 1. ''Of course,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bobby J. Jones, the right-hander who pitched fourth in the division series, will probably stay in that spot despite his one-hit shutout on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Jones could pitch the third game on five days' rest -- and be in position to start a possible Game 6 -- but Phillips indicated it might not be wise to give extra rest to Rick Reed, who started Game 3 of the division series. Reed is a touch-and-feel pitcher who does better on regular -- but not too much -- rest.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Tickets for Games 3, 4 and 5 of the National League Championship Series will go on sale today. They will be sold by telephone only through the team's ticket office at (718) 507-8499, starting at 9 a.m. Fans may buy up to 12 tickets for the series.</p>
