        <p>SUCCESS -- three floors of it -- is in the air above Fifth Avenue at the pulse point of Finlay Enterprises, the billion-dollar jewelry conglomerate that serves anybody and everybody who keeps in trinkets without crossing Tiffany's costly threshold. If your jewelry hails from a department store, not a pale blue box, chances are that David B. Cornstein, who had never been inside any jewelry store until he opened his own at a J. C. Penney's on Long Island 38 years ago, supplied it.</p>
        <p>Now, 1,200 stores later, Finlay's chairman emeritus thanks you for your custom, and, if you reside in New York, is about to offer some civic-minded payback by helping Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sell the city's once moribund Off-Track Betting Corporation to the first $500 million bidder who passes muster.</p>
        <p>So what if Mr. Cornstein didn't know a tote line from a post time when he agreed to replace the OTB's grime with gilt after Mr. Giuliani appointed him chairman of the board in 1984? Look what happened when he got behind the jewelry counter at J. C. Penney. The man made cash registers sing like choirs. ''You're selling romance and sizzle; it's a happy item to sell,'' he purrs, ''not like selling washing machines.'' And look what happened a year after Mr. Cornstein began making over the OTB -- he bought a racehorse, and now owns six.</p>
        <p>''You know all those people you see at the track jumping up and down and waving their arms? I've become one of those fools,'' he admits.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Cornstein, 62, the gambling outlet he revamped by treating it like a private sector venture -- not ''a dumping ground for political patronage'' -- has become a gold mine with its own brand of sizzle. What the city couldn't give away in 1994 when, to Mr. Cornstein's recollection, Mr. Giuliani condemned the OTB as ''the only bookie joint in the world that loses money,'' is now a marketable asset.</p>
        <p>''I recommended to him that he fix it up, then sell it,'' said Mr. Cornstein, who bonded with Mr. Giuliani after deciding not to challenge him in a 1989 mayoral primary, ''and he said, 'O.K., you run it.' ''</p>
        <p>How fond has Mr. Cornstein become of the unprofitable product he was tapped to reinvent? He says he would buy it himself if he could, especially if he could merge it with the New York Racing Association and make himself chief executive officer of ''a $3 billion company.''</p>
        <p>''But I couldn't pull it off,'' he said. ''I would be the top bidder if I could, but I was told I'd have a grand jury investigation centering on me the next morning.'' He found the prospect worth a chuckle.</p>
        <p>COME on, Mr. Cornstein, you're just trying to drive up the price. Not so, he says. He thinks the city should keep a minority stake and says he already has Mr. Giuliani's nod on that.</p>
        <p>Last year, the New York City division of the OTB posted $137 million in profits, $39 million of it earmarked for the city, the rest to the state and N.Y.R.A.</p>
        <p>''It would be terrible if a new owner comes in, and in a year is making $150 million in profit, and we sold for $400 million!'' he said. ''We'll -- I mean the city will -- look like fools.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Cornstein's impressive gold horse-head cuff links catch the glint from a desk-load of laminated award plaques while seductive Francesco Scavullo photographs of his wife of 31 years, Sheila, beam in triplicate from the office wall.</p>
        <p>Noting that Mr. Scavullo remains ''a dear friend,'' he points to a different photo montage, of his first and best racehorse, Grand Slam. He bought the stallion in 1985 for $360,000, refused a $5 million offer for him in 1998, and put him out to stud, he said, ''with 160 appointments last year at $35,000 a pop. He's smiling.'' So is Mr. Cornstein, hence his bubbly proclamation: ''It's been a magical, magical life for me. I've been lucky my whole life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cornstein views ailing but salvageable businesses like handyman's specials, which is why taking the downtrodden OTB and turning it into a sleeper with a billion-dollar handle is his idea of fun.</p>
        <p>He grew up an only child, attended Public School 168 ''in the Upper West Side war zone,'' he said, and when his father's rug-cleaning business permitted a move to West End Avenue and 76th Street, he went to Horace Mann School, and later got an M.B.A. from New York University. He was applying to law schools when J. C. Penney, which two years earlier had turned down his first business proposal, for a watch repair franchise from which he naively figured he could retire after 18 months if things worked out, called and offered a jewelry store in Lake Success, N.Y. With his parents' savings (''about $20,000,'' he said), he bought in.</p>
        <p>Thirty stores later, he got another out-of-the-blue phone summons, this time from Harold S. Geneen, the chief executive of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. Mr. Cornstein calls him ''the predominant business mind in the world in the 1960's,'' and compares him to John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric Company, and Lee A. Iacocca, the former chairman of the Chrysler Corporation. So in 1982 he found himself in a partnership with Mr. Geneen, who died in 1997, and Nathaniel de Rothschild. Their takeover target was a business that included Finlay. ''We bought in at $41 million, $40 million of it debt, and three years later it was worth $175 million, with no debt,'' Mr. Cornstein said.</p>
        <p>No debt. No regrets. ''Did I tell you I've had a magical life?'' Twice.</p>
