        <p>An unexpected delay was granted in the Lockerbie bombing trial today when prosecutors surprised the court by announcing that they had new evidence ''of some complexity and considerable sensitivity'' that they needed time to consider.</p>
        <p>The chief prosecutor, Colin Boyd, would not describe the evidence, but said it came from a foreign country,  not the United States, that it bore on the defense's likely cross-examination of his witnesses and that it would probably have to be disclosed to the defense.</p>
        <p>Scottish law requires that prosecutors tell defense lawyers about any evidence exculpatory of their client, and the Lockerbie prosecutors have already been sharply criticized on that score.</p>
        <p>His request for a delay until Oct. 17 was granted.</p>
        <p>The only prominent witness the prosecution is still expected to call is a Palestinian terrorist named Muhammad Abu Talb, who is now imprisoned in Sweden for bombing American and Jewish targets in Europe. Defense lawyers are trying to blame him and other Palestinians, not the two Libyans on trial, for the destruction of Pan Am flight 103, which crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.</p>
        <p>Whatever the new evidence is, said Robert Black, a University of Edinburgh law professor who closely follows the trial, the way Mr. Boyd phrased his request implies that it will tend to exonerate the Libyans and support the defense's theory that Mr. Talb and other Palestinians based in Germany and Sweden bombed the plane. Mr. Talb was an early suspect before the investigation shifted to the Libyans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd said he received the mysterious new evidence on Oct. 4.</p>
        <p>Professor Black noted how speedily Mr. Boyd had disclosed its existence.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors took weeks to disclose to the defense that prosecutors had seen Central Intelligence Agency cables depicting the most important defense witness as a chronic liar who was desperate for money and American citizenship at the time he became a federal witness in 1991. He did so by telling agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he had evidence against the two Libyans.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 11, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the trial of two Libyans charged in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, misstated the relationship of a witness to the case. A man depicted in cables by the Central Intelligence Agency as a chronic liar was a central witness for the prosecution, not for the defense. Defense witnesses will not testify until the prosecution concludes its case.</p>
