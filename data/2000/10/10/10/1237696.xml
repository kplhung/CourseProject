        <p>Regarding ''The Birth, Death and Rebirth of a Novel Disease-Fighting Tool'' (Oct. 3): Within hours of the publication of this article, a patient walked into my office asking why the prognosis of her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was so grim.</p>
        <p>Despite conversations that we had shared in which I had described favorable odds that the current treatments could cure her particular cancer, she read that the disease was ''usually incurable.''</p>
        <p>One can only imagine the tearful discussion we then had in trying to restore the hope for a better result, which she has maintained throughout the last rigorous months of chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are a family of disorders typically categorized into groups that are associated with differing risks of long-term disease control after appropriate chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>Low-grade disorders are typically associated with prolonged clinical courses but are most often ineradicable.  But a significant percentage of patients with more aggressive, intermediate or high-grade lymphomas (upward of 40 percent) have the chance of being cured with the present treatments.</p>
