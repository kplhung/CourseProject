        <p>During a recent visit to New York for the publication of her new novel, ''The Blind Assassin,'' Margaret Atwood spoke about a great aunt who, toward the end of her life, was blind and an invalid. When relatives asked her what she thought about during her long, solitary days, she answered, ''I'm lying here writing the story of my life, and when I come to the end I will close the book.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Atwood said that her aunt's response ''may be a key to the novel -- I just hadn't thought about it before.'' She added, ''I think that for a lot of people the narrative form of the book is a metaphor for life.'' Everybody has a story to tell, ''and sometimes they're just arranging their lives.''</p>

        <p>During a recent visit to New York for the publication of her new novel, ''The Blind Assassin,'' Margaret Atwood spoke about a great aunt who, toward the end of her life, was blind and an invalid. When relatives asked her what she thought about during her long, solitary days, she answered, ''I'm lying here writing the story of my life, and when I come to the end I will close the book.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Atwood said that her aunt's response ''may be a key to the novel -- I just hadn't thought about it before.'' She added, ''I think that for a lot of people the narrative form of the book is a metaphor for life.'' Everybody has a story to tell, ''and sometimes they're just arranging their lives.''</p>
        <p>Iris Chase Griffen, the central character in ''The Blind Assassin,'' is not Ms. Atwood's great-aunt. Nor is she her grandmother. But in some respects there is a connection to both of them, as, at 82, Iris looks back at her life and the life of her country, Canada, over the 20th century.</p>
        <p>With this, her 10th novel, Ms. Atwood offers added certification to her lofty position in world literature. Because of her fiction, her poetry and her essays, she has proved herself to be a versatile woman of letters. In 1996 she won the  Giller Prize in Canada for ''Alias Grace,'' and she is now a judge in that competition. ''The Blind Assassin'' has received generally favorable reviews, especially in England, and immediately took its place on the New York Times best-seller list.</p>
        <p>The book is a novel within a novel within a novel. Within Iris's memories is a story of lovers secretly meeting and inventing a science fiction fantasy (the most interior of the three stories) about a blind assassin. Eventually each story helps to illuminate the others.</p>
        <p>Gradually Iris reveals necessary information about her sister, Laura, about her own unhappy marriage and the lies and compromises within relationships. The first sentence announces Laura's apparent suicide: ''Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.'' Almost to the last page, the book retains its sense of mystery, especially about the novel that Laura has supposedly left as a legacy.</p>
        <p>In common with Ms. Atwood's other books, ''The Blind Assassin'' is marked by lyrical writing and the intricacy of the narrative. The reader is repeatedly caught by surprise. There is a wry wit, also evidenced in Ms. Atwood's conversation, which is filled with ironic observations and literary references. Occasionally, it is underscored by a kind of conspiratorial laughter. Contrary to her somewhat austere public image, she has a frivolous side and a down-to-earth outlook on those who comment on her. Recently two unauthorized biographies of her were published. She said she had no plans to read them. ''It would drive me mad,'' she said, ''because I know and they don't.''</p>
        <p>Of the art of fiction, she said, ''Virginia Woolf said that writing a novel is like walking through a dark room with a lantern which illuminates the things that were always there. I think a lot of the things in 'The Blind Assassin' were always there in my life and in the world, but they got into the novel because you hold up the lantern.''</p>
        <p>The idea for the book came when she was writing ''Alias Grace.'' Under a different name, Iris provided the narrative framework for that book, but quite early on was excised and went into Ms. Atwood's desk drawer along with other discarded characters. Then one day, she said, the drawer opened and out popped Iris. As with the inspiration for other works, she calls it ''a visitation.'' She realized she could use Iris as the heroine of the character's own story.</p>
        <p>Tracing her further back in her history, she said: ''She had something in a box. Originally it was a hatbox. It turned into a steamer trunk. Things transmute in rather alarming ways when you're writing a book.'' Having discovered the trunk, she ''looked'' inside and found a manuscript and other material.</p>
        <p>As always, she began by drawing a chart, a kind of family tree of the characters, listing their birth dates and other important events. ''It's a lot like a trial,'' she said, ''in which you know exactly where you were on the night of Nov. 26.'' She is scrupulous about not making factual mistakes in her fictional world.</p>
        <p>Discussing blindness, she pointed to several literary precedents, among them H. G. Wells's story ''The Country of the Blind'' and the character of Blind Pew in ''Treasure Island,'' who frightened her as a child. ''The poetic contrast between the eyes of the body and the inner eye, the eye of vision, was of great interest to me, for all kinds of reasons.''</p>
        <p>She paused. ''Of course, you know who the blind assassin really is. Ultimately it's Iris. But I can't explain it without talking about the end of the book.'' All she would say was that sometimes, ''People do things without knowing what they're doing.''</p>
        <p>Although reviewers have generally approached the book as a family chronicle, Ms. Atwood said that it was less about the family than about the two sisters. As such, she said, ''you can call it Jane Austen in a very black mode.'' She qualified that statement: ''There are scenes of physical beauty, but they were not emotionally happy times for Iris. You know Tennyson's 'Sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.' I would say that happier things are embedded in the novel within the novel.''</p>
        <p>Having categorized ''The Edible Woman'' as an anticomedy and ''Surfacing'' as a ghost story, she was asked how she would describe ''The Blind Assassin.'' ''A novel is a very, very capacious container,'' she said, resisting all categories. About her book, she said, ''It is essentially about two things: human sacrifice and writing.'' Are they two different things or are they related? ''Of course, they're related,'' she said, but hesitated about offering an explanation. She said readers would have to wait until her forthcoming book of essays is published.</p>
        <p>Then she relented. ''It's essay No. 3, which is called 'The Great God Pen.' '' The reference is to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem ''A Musical Instrument,'' in which ''the great god Pan'' hollows out a reed. ''He blows through it and all this beautiful music comes out.''</p>
        <p>''What he is doing is making a poet out of man,'' Ms. Atwood said. ''He's had his heart ripped out; he's a hollow reed, but very musical. That was certainly the idea that developed in the 19th century and through T. S. Eliot. Somehow the human part of you is sacrificed to art.''</p>
        <p>She said she was not sure she believed that, but it is ''the way we regard the great artist figure, someone who has sacrificed, and that's why the Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton figures had power.'' And that is why in ''The Blind Assassin,'' ''people are leaving little candle stubs on Laura Chase's grave.''</p>
        <p>The person becomes iconic and the work is submerged? ''It doesn't matter, does it, for the candle stub leavers, for those who see Elvis in his white suit in the supermarket. Or Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Princess Di. The gods always demand young beautiful sacrifices. Iphigenia  was sacrificed to get a good wind for Troy. Mature persons don't make good human sacrifices. No banks of flowers for us.''</p>
        <p>Today, she is, at 60, in her own words, ''an old crock,'' or, as she corrected herself, ''an older crock.'' ''We could use the word mature,'' she said. ''I'm reaching for mature wisdom. I feel shortly I will be able to be in a position to say to younger people who are having a bad time, don't worry, it'll be all right. Don't drive the car off the bridge. That's what Iris says.''</p>
        <p>Live life and keep writing as long as you can? ''Writing is not a necessity. It has been, but it need not continue to be. If I think I'm writing the telephone book, I'd stop.'' She paused and then added: ''There's always this tug of war. If you're writing, you're not living, and if you're living, you're not writing. So which are you going to do?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Atwood tries to do both, writing her novels and poetry and also enjoying her life in Toronto with the novelist Graeme Gibson. She shares his fervent interest in studying birds and other wildlife.</p>
        <p>When the next creative visitation strikes, undoubtedly Ms. Atwood will be back at her desk writing another capacious novel. For inspiration, perhaps, she will think of her epigraph from the Canadian novelist Sheila Watson: ''The word is a flame burning in a dark glass.''</p>
