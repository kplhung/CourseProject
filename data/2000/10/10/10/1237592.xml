        <p>The museum director pulled a hammer from the tool chest, pounded the nail into the wall and gently hung the last of the four prized paintings. Then he stepped back and admired the mysterious occupants of the small, freshly painted gallery.</p>
        <p>Three of the paintings are startling and bold portraits, radiant in gilt frames. The fourth, just hung by Vural Yurdakul, director of the State Painting and Sculpture Museum  here, is thin and shabby, its unframed Cubist-style image of two people at a table barely visible.</p>
        <p>Turkish officials say that the paintings, seized by the Turkish police in four separate incidents over five months, are the work of Pablo Picasso. Each bears the stamps, signatures and other paraphernalia of  authenticity.</p>
        <p>But Picasso was not only one of the most prolific of modern artists; he is among those whose work is the most forged. Experts outside Turkey, hearing about the paintings, expressed doubt about their authenticity.</p>
        <p>Police and cultural officials speculate that the works were plundered 10 years ago from the palaces and museums of Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion that led to the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>But no one has come forward to claim ownership, and the authorities are puzzled about why the paintings surfaced separately, within a few weeks of one another, so long after the war's end. ''We think some kind of an organized group has taken these paintings,'' said Turkey's culture minister, Istemihan Talay. ''But we don't actually have a very clear idea where they are coming from and who has stolen them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Talay said that Turkey's leading experts on modern art had examined the paintings and were convinced that they were are authentic. He said he was willing to have foreign experts on Picasso inspect them as well.</p>
        <p>Sami Alsulayman, a Kuwaiti diplomat in Ankara, said that the embassy had received no information about the paintings and that Kuwait had not claimed ownership, but he added that many works of art stolen by the Iraqis had never been returned.</p>
        <p>The earliest of the works on display here, dated 1903, is a ''Portrait of a Young Woman measuring about 19 1/4 by 13 3/4 inches bearing two stamps on the back, from the Berko Art Gallery and, dated 1931, from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia.  The canvas is signed on the back.</p>
        <p>''The Farmer's Wife,'' which is dated 1908 and measures 31 7/8 by  25 5/8 inches, has similar stamps from Berko and the Hermitage and is signed on the back. Turkish officials describe it as a portrait of a Mme. Putman that Picasso must have painted after arriving in France from his native Spain.</p>
        <p>The third portrait, ''Ugly Woman,'' is said to be a 1938 depiction of Dora Maar, one of Picasso's mistresses. The signature appears on the model's right arm, along with the date, '38. It measures 31 1/8 by 20 inches and the back bears a stamp reading ''Galerie Natalie Seroussi, Paris.''</p>
        <p>The fourth canvas, well worn, is titled ''Two People at a Table Holding Wineglasses'' and believed to have been painted around 1920, though it has no date. It measures 31 1/2 by 24 3/8 centimeters; on the back is a 12-digit number and the name of the Christie's auction house.</p>
        <p>''The Farmer's Wife'' and ''Ugly Woman'' were seized in June from people trying to sell them to undercover officers in separate incidents in Izmir, a major city on the Aegean Sea and the endpoint of an ancient smuggling route to Greece and Europe. ''The Portrait of a Young Woman'' turned up in August in Hatay, a city in southern Turkey.</p>
        <p>Acting on a tip, police officers said they went to a local man's home and seized the painting. ''He said he bought it five or six years ago from someone in northern Iraq and he was keeping it home since,'' said Selcuk Kaya, a police official in nearby Sanliurfa. ''He wasn't looking to sell it.''</p>
        <p>Turkish press reports about the paintings apparently yielded ''Two People at a Table Holding Wineglasses.'' The police say that several people approached an undercover officer in the southern city of Adana in late September offering to sell a Picasso for $4 million to $5 million. When the undercover officer agreed to pay a $10,000 deposit and asked to see the painting, he was taken to a private home in Mardin, on the Iraqi border.</p>
        <p>The man who had the painting runs a small antique store and stated that he bought the painting eight or nine years ago for $2,000 from a Turkish truck driver crossing the border from Iraq, the police said. After reading about the other reputed Picassos, the police said he told them, he recognized the potential value of his painting and wanted to sell it.</p>
        <p>Malcolm Kenwood, an official with Art Loss Register, a database of stolen art in London, said that more than 400 Picassos were listed as stolen in the company's records, more than for any other artist. But he said the registry received many inquiries from the authorities and insurers about works thought to be Picassos that ultimately prove to be fakes. He said he did not believe that the four paintings in Turkey were listed as stolen in the database and he advised that a Picasso expert make the determination about their authenticity.</p>
        <p>Auction house experts say that they are deluged with requests to authenticate paintings thought to be Picassos and that most of those works are fake. But for now, the four paintings are sharing a small second-floor gallery at the state museum here, along with several enlarged photographs of the artist and a brief biography.</p>
