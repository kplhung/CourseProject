        <p>Attention, fans of ''Charlotte's Web'' and ''Stuart Little.'' Gov. George Pataki is sorry he made fun of E. B. White.</p>
        <p>''He got an earful from his daughter Emily last night,'' a spokesman for New York's governor said yesterday. Mr. Pataki denounced the late Mr. White on Sunday as a fancy-pants literary type whom no true New Yorker would have heard of. But it turns out he used to read Mr. White's book about the canny spider to his own kids when they were little.</p>
        <p>''He just forgot,'' said the spokesman.</p>
        <p>This all started at the debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio on Sunday, when both candidates were asked to define a New Yorker. ''Well, you know E. B. White and others have done that over the years,'' started off Mrs. Clinton. It was a true Hillary moment, in the sense that she did not actually quote Mr. White, but still wanted us to know she had done her required reading.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, who was on Mr. Lazio's post-debate spin team, tried to make fun of her name-dropping by attacking Mr. White, a Mount Vernon, N.Y., native and New Yorker essayist who wrote a lovely book about what it was to be a New Yorker, along with some of the best-loved children's stories of all time, one of them about a mouse who lived right off Central Park. ''It doesn't sound to me like that guy was a New Yorker or understood New York the way we do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Attention, students of political strategy. Note the canny way that Mr. Pataki has totally deflected all media attention from Mr. Lazio (who turned out to know exactly who E. B. White was) and onto himself. Last weekend's debate will be remembered as the one in which Mr. Pataki dissed a famous writer, Mrs. Clinton separated herself from her husband's Mideast policy, and a viewer posed a question about a tax on e-mails that turned out to be an Internet hoax.</p>
        <p>What do all three of these events have in common? They are not about Rick Lazio. He came, he saw, he fell off the radar screen. Story of this Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>When things get tough in this race, the Republicans always start talking about how Mrs. Clinton is Not From Here. After the debate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced that anybody From Here would understand the importance of bringing the Jets and Giants back from New Jersey, and support subsidies for a stadium in Manhattan. This is an excellent way to bridge that pesky gender gap, as suburban women are known for their keen desire to spend tax dollars on professional football.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio is one of us. Rick Lazio looks, sounds and talks like a New Yorker,'' chimed in Mr. Pataki. Since this debate was held in a city where close to half the residents were born in another country, you do not really want to get into the question of what a New Yorker looks and sounds like. You also do not want to go on record as saying that ''people from Brooklyn or Peekskill'' would not be caught dead quoting ''E. B. White, or whatever his name is.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday the gubernatorial press office issued a retraction of sorts: ''The Governor values learning. He thinks everyone should be reading 'Charlotte's Web' to their kids.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's performance was yet another piece of evidence of a disturbing election-year phenomenon. It is becoming increasingly apparent that he and George W. Bush are actually the same person. Or maybe twins, like those girls in ''The Parent Trap'' who go to camp and discover they're bunking with an exact replica.</p>
        <p>The first signs appeared earlier in the campaign, when Mr. Pataki was trying to wriggle his way into the vice-presidential sweepstakes. Inquiring minds could not help noticing that you had two guys named George who went to Yale in the mid-60's, joined the Republican Party and got elected governor of a very large state. They both like to brag about their small-town roots, are a little shaky when the subject turns to foreign policy, and try to steer clear of the religious right during campaign season. They both currently have daughters at Yale. They are married to women whose first names begin with the letter L. (Cue ''X-Files'' theme music here.)</p>
        <p>And now we discover that they both experience problems of lost memory when it comes to children's literature. Mr. Bush, you may remember, was asked last year about his favorite boyhood book, and named ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar,'' which was written the year after he graduated from college.</p>
        <p>Very curious, Georges.</p>
