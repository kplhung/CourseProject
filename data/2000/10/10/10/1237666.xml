        <p>The county coroner in Boise, Idaho, has tentatively identified a body found in the Boise River as that of a  flight attendant based at Kennedy Airport who has been missing for more than two weeks, the police said yesterday. They are calling her death a homicide, but say they have no suspects.</p>
        <p>The flight attendant, Lynn Henneman, 38, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., was last seen at a restaurant near the river in Boise on the night of Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>A United Airlines flight attendant for three years, Ms. Henneman had been staying in that city on a one-night layover, and told other flight attendants that she was planning to take a walk along the river. Her co-workers reported her missing when she did not show up for her flight the next morning.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the naked body of a woman was found by a fisherman about four miles downstream from where Ms. Henneman was last seen. The police said they did not believe that the woman had been killed near there, but that the body had been carried downstream by the river.</p>
        <p>There were no knife or bullet wounds on the body, said Lt. Jim Tibbs of the Boise police, and more forensic tests were required before the cause of death could be determined. ''The coroner is 99.9 percent sure that it is Lynn,'' Lieutenant Tibbs said, ''but they've got to confirm that with dental charts.''</p>
        <p>The Ada County coroner, Erwin Sonnenberg, did not respond to messages left yesterday with his office. But The Idaho Statesman quoted him as saying that the woman found appeared to have been killed about the time of Ms. Henneman's disappearance, and that it was not known if she had been sexually assaulted.</p>
        <p>This is the first homicide in Boise this year, Lieutenant Tibbs said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the police said they had found several items belonging to Ms. Henneman under a bridge frequented by transients at the edge of downtown Boise, about two miles from where the body was found.</p>
        <p>The police are looking at the possibility that Ms. Henneman was killed by a transient, but are not limiting their investigation to any group of people, Lieutenant Tibbs said.</p>
        <p>A $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of a suspect has been offered -- half from her family, and half from United Airlines. Ms. Henneman was married three weeks before her disappearance.</p>
        <p>In an earlier interview, Mark Pettet, of Idaho Falls, who is married to Ms. Henneman's sister, said Ms. Henneman had always wanted to be a flight attendant.</p>
        <p>''She just really enjoyed going out and seeing the city life and wandering around on her own,'' Mr. Pettet said. A family member at his home yesterday said that he could not come to the phone.</p>
