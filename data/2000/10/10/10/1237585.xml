        <p>My friend Robert and his wife spent their summer in the demoralizing activity of second-guessing a doctor.</p>
        <p>Some people make enjoyable careers of this practice, but most find it infuriating and depressing, especially when their own health is involved. The fact that, in the end, Robert and his wife turned out to be far better doctors than their doctor has only made them feel worse.</p>
        <p>Both of them are sensible and generally healthy, the kind of people who know, as they enter their 50's, that they should find a regular doctor, but haven't gotten around to it quite yet.</p>
        <p>Then, at the end of June, Robert got a rash.</p>
        <p>They had never seen anything like it before -- a smooth dark pink patch that started out in the groin and within a couple of days had spread down the inside of Robert's left thigh. It didn't itch and didn't hurt. If anything, the area felt numb.</p>
        <p>After watching the patch get bigger and redder and angrier for a few days, Robert's wife decided something had to be done. Visions of flesh-eating strep and blood poisoning flashed through her mind. Robert, who was gardening and running four miles a day, felt his imminent demise was unlikely, but he was also a little worried.</p>
        <p>It was a Saturday and the local medical offices were closed. They opened the phone book and found a practice in the next town that could see Robert in 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Instantly upon seeing the rash, the doctor said it was jock itch,'' Robert said. It made perfect sense. ''Hey, what am I if not a jock?'' he said.</p>
        <p>He left the office with a prescription for antifungal pills and cream, an appointment for a routine physical the following week, and the small, happy glow of having efficiently dealt with all his medical needs for years to come -- and on a Saturday, too.</p>
        <p>The glow was short-lived. His physical yielded not the clean bill of health he had expected, but different news. His blood showed highly abnormal liver enzyme levels, the doctor said. He should see a hematologist right away. A name and phone number were provided.</p>
        <p>''Hematologist?'' Robert's wife said that night. ''Isn't that blood? Isn't liver something else?''</p>
        <p>And so it began. The next day Robert's wife began to ask around. Hematologist was indeed blood. She looked up the antifungal pills Robert was taking in a reference book. Abnormal liver enzymes were listed as a possible side effect. Wouldn't it make more sense to recheck Robert's blood after the medication was out of his system, before getting involved with a specialist?</p>
        <p>They never made the appointment. Instead, an anxious month later, Robert got another set of blood tests. His liver tests were back to normal. His rash had, meanwhile, melted away.</p>
        <p>But the family's relief did not last long. Within a few days Robert really did start to feel really sick. His neck hurt. His shoulders hurt. His collar bones hurt. His jaws hurt. He could barely chew. One of his legs began to feel strange.</p>
        <p>Now they were really worried. Maybe he should have seen that specialist after all.</p>
        <p>Cowed, Robert made another appointment with the doctor. After a quick exam, he was told he probably had a virus.</p>
        <p>Could it be Lyme disease, Robert wondered aloud, suddenly remembering long sessions out pruning the shrubbery in a pair of skimpy running shorts.</p>
        <p>Unlikely, he was told. Not at all typical. But we'll test you if you want.</p>
        <p>Robert's test for Lyme disease was unequivocally positive.</p>
        <p>Even so, it was a full two weeks later, with Labor Day over and his symptoms slowly subsiding on antibiotics, that his wife looked at him over the kitchen table and gasped. She suddenly knew what that long-vanished rash had really been.</p>
        <p>Robert had had Lyme disease all along, from the rash of early infection to the joint pains and fatigue of established disease.  And the whole thing could have been avoided if the doctor who was open on Saturdays had taken a moment to think.</p>
        <p>A medical educator would have a field day analyzing this tale of missed signals, in which a board-certified practitioner -- who, incidentally, did all his postgraduate training in parts of the East Coast crawling with Lyme -- made every mistake in the book. He overtested, and undertested, overtreated and undertreated, and never bothered to slow down, read the chart, and think.</p>
        <p>The moral of this story, the educator might conclude, is that we desperately need better medical schools. A patient advocate might say it argues instead for constant consumer vigilance; a Lyme activist would urge more Lyme awareness; a policy analyst more accessible urgent care.</p>
        <p>Robert and his wife second all these proposals, though they are now little weary of the whole thing. They don't want to be their own doctors, train their own doctors or keep a constant wary eye on their doctors. They just want one who can think.</p>
