        <p>The professor uses henna to redden his long beard, and that, along with a natural smile, makes him appear somewhat jovial, an unexpected cheerfulness from someone who commands what many believe to be a group of terrorists.</p>
        <p>Killing, of course, is a pious man's obligation, ''to destroy the forces of evil and disbelief,'' explained the professor, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. His rapidly growing organization, Lashkar-e-Taiba (the Army of the Pure), is duty-bound to ''bring death to oppressors.''</p>
        <p>With that in mind, he sends hundreds of Pakistanis to fight in the jihad against India in Kashmir, he said. First the young men are taught to recite the Koran and to reflect on the virtues of a reverent Muslim society. Then, as with almost any other army, they are taught how to fire automatic weapons, set off explosives and slit throats.</p>
        <p>But these days the killing by Lashkar is too often confused with killing by others, the professor said testily. He is distressed by ''Indian propaganda'' that falsely accuses the Army of the Pure of slaying the purely innocent, as in the massacre of 35 Sikh villagers in March on the day President Clinton arrived in India for a visit.</p>
        <p>And this concerns him: the State Department is considering Lashkar for Washington's roster of the world's most wicked, the blacklist of ''foreign terrorist organizations.''</p>
        <p>''This would be a grave injustice,'' said Mr. Saeed. ''We do not kill civilians, only aggressors. We don't believe it right to kill even a non-Muslim unless he is an aggressor.''</p>
        <p>The interview was conducted in one of Lashkar's many offices in the historic city of Lahore. Cookies and dried fruit were brought in on silver platters. The politeness was exemplary, though in serving an American guest, the graciousness did not extend to removing a wall poster that showed the American flag in flames, along with the Indian flag.</p>
        <p>''Destroy the nonbelievers,'' the placard read.</p>
        <p>The professor's anxiety about the opinions of the State Department was a bit puzzling. Why does he care? The punitive effect of being on the blacklist would be minimal, he admitted. Lashkar has little need for American visas. It has no assets to freeze in American banks.</p>
        <p>Mostly, he said, he is offended by the simple gall of it. ''Who is America to judge us?'' he said. ''We don't trust America, and we certainly do not see it as a champion of justice.''</p>
        <p>He has fired off a letter of protest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saeed is 53, retired now as a professor of Islamic studies at an engineering college. In the 1980's he went off to fight in the jihad that chased Soviet invaders out of neighboring Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>''America supported us with guns,'' he said. ''If we were not terrorists then, why are we terrorists now? How can Americans stand for such double standards?''</p>
        <p>To him, the 53-year-old custody battle for the Himalayan territory of Kashmir is an open-and-shut case, with Pakistan in the right. He likens the Indian ''occupation'' of the disputed territory to the imperialism of the Soviets.</p>
        <p>Not only does he want Kashmir to become a part of Pakistan, but he also wants Pakistan to become a part of a global Islamic state. ''Muslims throughout the world are one country,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saeed's vexation with America is hardly uncommon in this nation of 150 million. Uncle Sam is perceived to favor India, the emerging regional superpower and a potential market with one billion consumers. Pakistan, on the other hand, is near financial collapse.</p>
        <p>In addition to jihad, men like Mr. Saeed provide schools to the masses, places where the poor can send their children to be both educated and fed. Those are services that Pakistan's relentless tag team of military and civilian governments has been unable to provide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saeed sits atop more than the Army of the Pure. In 1989 he began the Markaz Ad-daawah Wal Irshad, the Center for Preaching. It has more than 130 schools and a modern-looking university that rises out of the wheat fields near Lahore.</p>
        <p>Lashkar is now a political force within Pakistan, just as it is a guerrilla army in Kashmir. The money behind the group, the professor said, comes entirely from private donors. He denied widely held suspicions that Lashkar is on the payroll of Pakistan's government, whose intelligence agencies have been a willing sponsor of the 11-year-old Kashmir jihad.</p>
        <p>''People who send their sons to fight in jihad also give money for that purpose,'' the professor said vaguely, uncomfortable with the subject. ''Do not ask me about numbers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Saeed had selected the group's media center for the meeting. Only a single guard was stationed out front, a machine gun in his hand, an ammunition belt across his shoulder. Inside, young men were hunched over computer keyboards, writing for Lashkar's various magazines. An escort enforced a ban on photographing people. The professor said the capture of human images is forbidden by Islam.</p>
        <p>Lashkar has proven itself a clever self-promoter. Its posters are bright and arresting. Its magazines are enticing, with articles like ''Koran and Astronomy'' and ''Prophet's Medicine: Olive Is the Cure for 70 Diseases.'' The last page in the international edition of Voice of Islam is a recruitment pitch for jihad: ''Learn how to use swords, spears, daggers and how to attack disbeliever forces, how to set up an ambush and lay siege to the camps and cantonments of the enemy, how to protect yourself and other oppressed Muslims during crackdowns and blackouts. Learn all these things through the Koran.''</p>
        <p>The professor made a gift of a bound volume of back issues of the magazine. He was tiring of all this talk about terrorism, though his interest slightly revived when the subject turned to Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. He said those apocalyptic bombs were good to have, but only as a means to deter an enemy.</p>
        <p>''To use such weapons in jihad would be un-Islamic,'' he said, pointing his finger. ''To use them: that is terrorism. And what is the only country to use them?''</p>
        <p>The answer left him with a triumphant smile.</p>
        <p>''America,'' he said. ''So who is the terrorist?''</p>
