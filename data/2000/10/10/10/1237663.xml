        <p>Three scientists who have made important contributions to understanding the long-term changes in the brain that underlie memory and mood were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine yesterday.</p>
        <p>Dr. Arvid Carlsson of the University of Gothenberg in Sweden and two New Yorkers, Dr. Eric R. Kandel of Columbia University and Dr. Paul Greengard of Rockefeller University, will share prize money of nine million Swedish crowns, or $914,700.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carlsson, 77, discovered that dopamine was an important chemical signal in the region of the brain that controls movement, a discovery that laid the basis for finding that the agent is depleted in patients with Parkinson's and that the disease could be treated with the drug L-dopa.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kandel, 70, has worked to understand the changes that take place in brain cells when memories are formed. Dr. Greengard, 74, has focused on unraveling the intricate cascade of events that occurs inside a neuron after a signal is received.</p>
        <p>The common thread of the three biologists' work is that each has made many important contributions to understanding the brain at the molecular level, in particular in working out the changes that occur inside a neuron after it has received a signal from another neuron. The complexity of the brain stems from the vast number of synapses, or interconnections -- at least 100 trillion -- made between its 100 billion nerve cells or neurons. Unlike a computer, whose connections are hard-wired, the synapses continually alter their strength, adding an extra layer of subtlety to the brain's operations.</p>
        <p>These fine changes of strength have emerged as essential features of the brain's operation because they affect long-term processes, including mood and memory.</p>
        <p>The findings of the three Nobel recipients ''represent the platform on which we now stand to investigate the long-term changes in the nervous system that are at the heart not only of normal memory but also of many mental illnesses and the treatment for these illnesses,'' said Dr. Steven Hyman, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles Stevens, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego, said of the honorees, ''All of these people are towering figures in the field, and people have expected them to get the Nobel prize for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Each has made many contributions, Dr. Stevens said, and was being honored not for a single dramatic advance but for cumulative research that ''changes our view of how the nervous system works.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kandel fled Austria in 1939, at the age of 9, and came to the United States. While at Harvard University, majoring in English and literature, he was drawn to psychoanalysis, which at that time, he said, ''everyone thought was the gateway to the mind.''</p>
        <p>He went to medical school to become a psychoanalyst, but, feeling he should know something about how the brain worked, he took a course in neurophysiology that shifted his interest toward research and the biology of memory.</p>
        <p>He worked first to record the activity of nerve cells in the hippocampus, the seat of memory formation, but decided he needed a simpler system. To the surprise of many of his colleagues, Dr. Kandel selected a humble invertebrate, the Aplysia sea slug, as his experimental animal.</p>
        <p>This bold choice proved fruitful. He soon encountered the puzzle that the slug's nerve cells were always wired in the same way. How could the rigidity of the wiring be reconciled with the flexibility of learning?</p>
        <p>''I realized that the strength of the connections was not specific and that this could be modified by learning,'' Dr. Kandel said.</p>
        <p>He proceeded to work out many biochemical changes that accompany memory formation, which have proved true on creatures from slugs to people. He showed how short-term memory involves just a modulation of the synapses while for long-term memory new synapses are created.</p>
        <p>Scientists often master just one or two techniques that they apply throughout their careers. Dr. Kandel has awed his colleagues by riding each new wave of experimental technique that came along.</p>
        <p>''Here is a man who started out with a problem -- he wanted to understand learning and memory -- and he has pursued that, learning whatever new tools he needed, throughout his career,'' Dr. Hyman  said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Solomon Snyder of Johns Hopkins University, a neurobiologist, said, ''Eric knows more neuroscience than any other person I know in the world. He taught himself neurobiology in his 60's and is now doing the best work of anyone.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kandel has put his knowledge and gift of synthesizing information to use as the lead author of a widely influential textbook on neuroscience.  He runs a large laboratory at Columbia, studying memory in the slug and the mouse, and even in his 70's he remains in the forefront of his field.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carlsson's work has focused on dopamine, one of a class of chemicals called neurotransmitters because they convey signals from one neuron to another. In the 1950's, when Dr. Carlsson was at the National Institutes of Health, he found that dopamine, then familiar as just the chemical precursor to another neurotransmitter, was a transmitter in its own right.</p>
        <p>With the help of a new instrument for measuring dopamine, he found it was present in high concentration in the corpus striatum, a part of the brain that regulates movement. He then showed that if animals were given a drug that lowers the brain's dopamine stores, they would lose control of their movements but their mobility could be restored by injections of L-dopa, a chemical that is converted to dopamine in the brain.</p>
        <p>Others confirmed that dopamine is depleted in patients with Parkinson's, and L-dopa became the principal treatment for the disease.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, Dr. Carlsson turned to studying how antischizophrenia drugs like chlorpromazine worked. He suggested that the drugs were blocking the receptors on neurons that pick up the dopamine signal. Given the knowledge at the time, Dr. Snyder said, his suggestion ''was sort of far out but it was absolutely right, and that discovery made it possible for drug companies to develop new drugs.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Greengard's research has also involved dopamine, in part for practical reasons. He chose to work on the principal cell type of the dopamine-making region of the brain, known as the medium-spiny projection neuron, because unlike the cerebral cortex, where many different types of neuron work side by side, the corpus striatum has almost pure medium-spiny neurons, giving enough material for biochemical analysis.</p>
        <p>In college, Dr. Greengard was interested in theoretical physics but since the main source of support at the time was the Atomic Energy Commission, the government's nuclear weapons agency, he decided to switch to the physics of biological systems.</p>
        <p>''I felt I didn't want to get into a line of research that could be misused,'' Dr. Greengard said.</p>
        <p>He became interested in the biochemistry of nerve cells, even though most brain biologists were studying the electrical properties of nerves.</p>
        <p>He took another contrarian step in suggesting that an important mechanism used by liver cells to store sugar might also work in the brain. The mechanism, phosphorylation, is a widespread means of regulating the activity of protein molecules by adding or removing small chemical groups known as phosphates.</p>
        <p>Dr. Greengard found that important signaling systems in his medium-spiny neurons were mediated by phosphorylation. Many biologists believed this was of little relevance because the only important thing about a neuron was whether it fired off a signal to another neuron or did not fire.</p>
        <p>''No one was terribly interested -- it wasn't ready for prime time,'' Dr. Greengard said of his discovery. ''People said, 'Poor Paul, I'm sure he'll find his way back onto the right path.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Stevens confirmed that, saying, ''Paul was alone for years, taking an approach that the electrophysiologists didn't care about.''</p>
        <p>But it turned out that the phosphorylation mechanism was the key event in slow synaptic transmission, the changes in synaptic strength that lasted over many hours or days. Signal transduction, the field pioneered by Dr. Greengard, is now a major focus of study.</p>
        <p>Dr. Greengard has worked out many aspects of the series of steps that occurs inside a neuron after dopamine has hit the cell's dopamine receptor. He has uncovered a cascade of changes that eventually reach a master protein inside the cell that is also the end point of pathways from other kinds of neurotransmitters besides dopamine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Greengard said he would give his share of the prize money to Rockefeller University for an annual award for women in biomedical research. The fund is to be set up in honor of his mother, who died giving birth to him.</p>
