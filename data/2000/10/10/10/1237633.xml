        <p>His salsa was so hot his friends said it should be a crime. So Russell Moore, a chef by day, named his culinary creation, Homicide Salsa.</p>
        <p>But this is Chicago, the city of Al Capone, where memories of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929 still linger. In more recent years, it has been the gang wars over drug turf in inner-city neighborhoods, like Englewood on Chicago's South Side, that have left the stain of loss and bloodshed. It is no wonder that someone would take offense to the name of Mr. Moore's salsa.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Roman Catholic priest known nationally for his crusades against alcohol billboards in black neighborhoods, marched into a small South Side grocery store this summer accompanied by a Fox Television news crew after learning that the salsa was on the store's shelves. Father Pfleger demanded that the owner remove the bottles of Homicide Salsa, saying that its name was offensive and that its makers seemed to be trying to cash in on the neighborhood's misery. The owner of the store, the only place selling the salsa, obliged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore, 32, and his business partner and sister, Dora Moore, 41, contend that their startup venture was carried out purely in the spirit of capitalism. And they continue to tell anyone who will listen that their label, which features a flaming chalk outline of a body, was simply an effort at savvy marketing in the highly competitive world of salsas, where braggadocio about a sauce's spiciness is as important as its contents.</p>
        <p>''You wouldn't name a sports car the GT Molasses,'' Mr. Moore said. ''Nor would you name a salsa Chef Russell's Peace and Serenity Salsa. Last I checked, America was a capitalist country. You can sell stuff. If you don't like it, don't buy it.''</p>
        <p>For the Moores, there is but one issue: the right to bottle and sell their product. For Father Pfleger, the dispute hinges on a lack of sensitivity in even selling something called Homicide Salsa, especially in a neighborhood where there were 782 homicides from 1989 to 1999, including 50 last year and 55 the year before, according to the Chicago Police Department. So far this year, there have been 37 homicides in the Englewood police district, the police said.</p>
        <p>Father Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Church, said the Moores crossed the line of social responsibility and poor taste. He learned of the sauce, he said, from a parishioner whose relative had been murdered and was upset when she saw the label while shopping.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was crazy,'' Father Pfleger said. ''I thought it was a sick play. I've never heard the word 'homicide' used for anything except for violence. We just felt that we don't need to glamorize or glorify this negative thing. If you say that violence is wrong and you have items on store shelves that have the name Homicide, you get comfortable. You legitimize it.''</p>
        <p>The Moores say that it is not that simple and that they are no less sensitive than Father Pfleger to Englewood's troubles. Father Pfleger is white. The Moores are black and grew up in Englewood, largely a working class community, where poverty and hope coexist, like tree-lined streets and sturdy brick houses that make up some blocks and the bald vacant lots and abandoned buildings that dot others. Ms. Moore still lives in Englewood with her mother.</p>
        <p>Father Pfleger, 51, is well known for his fight against alcohol billboards and against store owners who sell drug paraphernalia. Most recently, he has paid prostitutes for their time so he could preach the Gospel to them. But the Moores believe that in their case he reacted too quickly and too harshly.</p>
        <p>''I think he thought we were a bunch of white people selling this product and trying to profit off crime,'' said Ms. Moore, who earns $12 an hour as a waiter for a catering company. ''Now, if I came out with a product called Crack House Five, that would be offending someone.''</p>
        <p>''I admire some of the work he did,'' she said of Father Pfleger. ''But he's sort of jumping the gun on this one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore said Father Pfleger's opposition to his product was not ''a solution to what's happening in the Englewood community.''</p>
        <p>''With so many pressing issues that the community is plagued with, I was really thrown a loop when he came after my hot sauce,'' Mr. Moore said. ''He probably had to pass a good 50 well-known crack houses just to get to the store to get to my sauce.''</p>
        <p>Father Pfleger is not budging. He has vowed to campaign against Homicide Salsa should it show up again at local stores.</p>
        <p>At the same time, however, another member of the local clergy, the Rev. Albert Sampson, has come to the Moore family's aid. Mr. Sampson, who is black, has promised to help sell their salsa, but also hopes to persuade them to create what would likely be a less controversial ''soul'' salsa.</p>
        <p>''I cannot allow a white man without an economic program to stop some black folks who have some economic initiative,'' said Mr. Sampson, who is pastor of the Fernwood United Methodist Church. ''We're very disturbed that a man of Father Pfleger's stature would reduce our people to labels. He owes the African-American community an apology. And he owes the brothers and sisters an opportunity to buy the product.''</p>
        <p>The Moores make two kinds of salsa: Homicide -- described as very hot -- and Second-Degree Homicide -- a milder chili starter. The 16-ounce bottles sell for $2.50.</p>
        <p>Over the last two months, the salsa  has been the subject of a Chicago Sun-Times columnist and also has trickled into the discussions of local radio stations. In every instance, the Moores have pleaded their case to the public. They even supplied a D.J. with a case of salsa to give away to callers to let them judge for themselves.</p>
        <p>For now, the Moores are taking mail and telephone orders for their sauces, although they have not begun distribution.</p>
        <p>One thing the entrepreneurs said that they had neglected to do before they sunk $2,000 into their new business was to get a city business license. As soon as everything is legal, however, they intend to start delivering their salsa and trying to get it stocked on grocery shelves. That could happen as early as this week, they said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, they insist they will not change the name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore's friends say he also makes one heck of a sauce for buffalo chicken wings. Mr. Moore figures on bottling that too. He plans to call it House Arrest.</p>
