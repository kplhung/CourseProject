        <p>The president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., John Sweeney, plans to ask consumers to boycott three products made by Procter &amp; Gamble to show support for actors who are on strike against the advertising industry.</p>
        <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 13.1 million workers, will ask consumers to forgo the use of Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste and Ivory soap. The boycott is scheduled to be announced at a Tuesday morning rally in Bryant Park in Manhattan. Celebrities like Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, are scheduled to attend.</p>
        <p>''This strike has been going on for some time and I think it deserves even more attention than we've been giving it,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''The actors aren't alone in fighting for the future as the economy shifts, and employers sometimes value profits over people.''</p>
        <p>Actors also plan to stage protests at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Cincinnati on Tuesday and at a Procter &amp; Gamble plant in Oxnard, Calif.</p>
        <p>Union officials said Procter &amp; Gamble was chosen because it is one of the largest advertisers in the world and it has continued to make commercials during the strike using nonunion actors, said William Daniels, president of the Screen Actors Guild, which is representing the actors along with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.</p>
        <p>''We can't just target corporate America,'' said Mr. Daniels, noting that Procter &amp; Gamble is not the only offender. ''You have to pick out a target.''</p>
        <p>The boycott announcement comes as the two sides agreed to resume talks, which are being overseen by a federal mediator, on Oct. 19 in New York. Talks broke off on September 27. The actors have been on strike since May 1.</p>
        <p>''It's unfair to target just one company, particularly one with such a strong, long-standing history of partnership in producing commercials like Procter &amp; Gamble,'' said Tom Millikin, a company spokesman. ''The advertising industry has proposed a fair and lucrative contract which is in line with previous contracts the union has ratified.'' He added that the company would continue to make commercials using nonunion talent, but that Procter &amp; Gamble remained committed to negotiating a settlement.</p>
        <p>Griffin Dunne, an actor and director who has spoken in support of strikers, acknowledged that the announcement of a date for resuming talks did leave him with some concerns regarding the boycott. Still, he said, he supported the action.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to hold back,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''We simply don't have a deal.''</p>
        <p>While negotiators resolved one serious sticking point during the most recent talks -- going back to the status quo system of paying residuals for work on networks and a flat fee for cable -- they deadlocked on how much the cable work would pay. The unions supported increases over the three years of the contract that would ultimately pay $2,460 in the final year. The industry set the maximum payment for the third year at $1,850.</p>
        <p>Although the unions are not pressing to negotiate fees for commercials made exclusively for the Internet, they do want advertisers to recognize them as the exclusive bargaining unit for actors who perform on the Internet. The industry wants to study the issue over the next three years. The monitoring of how frequently commercials are shown has also been at issue.</p>
        <p>Negotiations with advertisers broke down late last month after nearly two consecutive weeks of talks. Mr. Daniels said the actors remained firm in their position.</p>
        <p>''The union has never been stronger than in the face of all this adversity, and this strike, that's gone on longer than any we've had, really kind of galvanized our union,'' Mr. Daniels said.</p>
