        <p>Sally Mayes  Firebird Cafe</p>
        <p>The platinum-haired cabaret singer and sometime Broadway performer Sally Mayes comes as close as any New York performer right now to embodying the spunky 1940's gals once portrayed by Ginger Rogers and Betty Grable in the movies. Like them she conveys the can-do spirit and the crisp self-sufficiency of a total professional.</p>

        <p>Sally Mayes  Firebird Cafe</p>
        <p>The platinum-haired cabaret singer and sometime Broadway performer Sally Mayes comes as close as any New York performer right now to embodying the spunky 1940's gals once portrayed by Ginger Rogers and Betty Grable in the movies. Like them she conveys the can-do spirit and the crisp self-sufficiency of a total professional.</p>
        <p>In her delightful new cabaret act,  Ms. Mayes touches on the 40's several times. One high point is a medley of sexy show tunes with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green that with its witty rhymes (making hilarious use of Latin terminology) is as lustfully up-front as any rap song by Li'l Kim.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mayes's highly polished show, which plays Wednesdays through Saturdays (at 363 West 46th Street, Clinton), features difficult, perfectly executed Andrews Sisters-style vocal harmonies from the singer and her backup musicians in several numbers. The show opens with the smoothly delivered rendition of that Lambert, Hendricks and Ross rapid-fire tongue twister ''Cloudburst.''</p>
        <p>A humorous cheeriness, rather than intimacy, is her forte. And her taste in amusing songs embraces everything from Weird Al Yankovic's rock 'n' roll revenge ballad ''One More Minute'' to Richard Maltby and David Shire's ''Miss Byrd,'' which she popularized in the Off Broadway revue ''Closer Than Ever.''</p>
        <p>In this brilliant jazz-flavored show tune, which Ms. Mayes turns into a comic showstopper, she is a New York real estate agent whose lunch-hour sexual interludes with a building superintendent keep her in state of gleeful joy. And she imagines the whole city filled with secretly happy women enjoying similar clandestine pleasures. It is great modern story song, and Ms. Mayes does it proud.</p>
