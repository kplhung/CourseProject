        <p>Ian Fountain, pianist  92nd Street Y</p>
        <p>Ian Fountain, an English pianist, won the Artur Rubinstein International Piano Competition in 1989, when he was 19. And if he is virtually unknown to New Yorkers, it is because he has wisely taken his time building his career. Still, his program biography lists concerto appearances with European and Japanese orchestras, and considerable recital experience, as well as recordings of solo and chamber works.</p>
        <p>More to the point, the concert on Saturday evening as part of the Young Europe series showed him to be a commanding, mature player. He opened his program with a driven account of Beethoven's Sonata No. 30 (Op. 109), and if there moments in the first movement in which Mr. Fountain flirted with a loss of control, he nevertheless kept the music under his fingers so that what could have become a train wreck blossomed into a passionate rendering.</p>
        <p>The other big work on the program was Rachmaninoff's Sonata No. 2.  Mr. Fountain played it with an unusually dark tone, but he had the technique to make it dazzle all the same. More striking, though, were his readings of the two smaller works on the program. The ''Evocacion'' from Albeniz's ''Iberia'' was gracefully nuanced and had just the right touch of exoticism. And in the most energizing performance of the evening, he moved easily between the lyrical and tempestuous currents of Chopin's Ballade No. 4, giving the work an irresistible expressive shapeliness.</p>
