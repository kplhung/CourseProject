        <p>If the Serbian people do not wish to prosecute Slobodan Milosevic for his corruption or abuses against domestic opponents, that is their right. But they have no right to pardon him for war crimes when the victims were outside their own society. Neither does the West.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Taking the Helm, Yugoslav Leader Faces Big Divisions'' (front page, Oct. 8):</p>
        <p>If the Serbian people do not wish to prosecute Slobodan Milosevic for his corruption or abuses against domestic opponents, that is their right. But they have no right to pardon him for war crimes when the victims were outside their own society. Neither does the West.</p>
        <p>News that Mr. Milosevic was given a deal helped along by the Russian foreign minister -- step down from power, and we won't push to extradite you for trial in The Hague -- is repugnant. If true, it is yet another in a long string of shameful acts by the international community in the Balkans. Being fired from your job, even in the most public and humiliating of circumstances, is not adequate punishment for mass murder.</p>
