        <p>Exhaustion set in about a half-hour after the Yankees eliminated Oakland late Sunday night, after they hosed down each other with Champagne. Tired and thrilled and relieved all at once, about a dozen players leaned back in chairs quietly, a few perching a beer on a knee, looking like a crew of trench diggers satisfied at the end of a hard day.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will go back to work tonight, when they open the four-of-seven-game American League Championship Series against the Seattle Mariners at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' pitching staff is in some disarray after the battle of relievers with Oakland in Game 5, prompting Manager Joe Torre to start a pitcher in Game 1 who has not pitched in the postseason -- the left-hander Denny Neagle, who will face Freddy Garcia.</p>
        <p>Torre used a three-man rotation of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez in the first round, skipping Neagle, who allowed 19 runs over 10 2/3 innings in his last three starts of the regular season. But Clemens and Pettitte each started two games in the first round -- both pitching poorly on short rest in the second game -- and they need some time to recuperate.</p>
        <p>Torre could have pitched Hernandez in Game 1 on three days' rest. But in discussing his options with Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach who is following the team on television as he recuperates from treatment for bone-marrow cancer, Torre decided it was best to start somebody else in Game 1 and then use Hernandez, Pettitte and Clemens in Games 2, 3 and 4, respectively, on full rest.</p>
        <p>Torre had to choose between Neagle and David Cone, who went 4-14 during the regular season and who is still pained by a shoulder dislocation suffered in September.</p>
        <p>''I considered a lot of things,'' Torre said. ''I just decided Neagle. Since we got him, he was one of our starters, and David is not 100 percent. No question, if it was just a matter of sending somebody's heart out there, you would'' pitch Cone.</p>
        <p>Neagle should match up well with the Mariners, in theory. Seattle has a predominantly right-handed hitting team, with Rickey Henderson, Mike Cameron, Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez at the top of their lineup. If Neagle has his control, he gets ahead in the counts and keeps right-handed hitters off balance and gets a lot of fly ball outs in spacious Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>But if Neagle works anxiously and falls behind in the count, as he did repeatedly in the last month of the season, the patient Mariners -- who led the league in walks -- could crush him. The Yankees got through the first round of the playoffs relying on just six pitchers, but now they need help from somebody else.</p>
        <p>The intention of Mariners Manager Lou Piniella was to start the left-hander Jamie Moyer in Yankee Stadium, but Moyer broke his kneecap during a workout Saturday and is out for the rest of the postseason. Piniella had considered using the left-hander John Halama in Game 1, but settled on Garcia, a talented right-hander limited to only 20 starts this season because of injuries. Halama is slated to start Game 2, Aaron Sele Game 3 and Paul Abbott Game 4. Piniella indicated that if the series went beyond four games, Garcia, Halama and Sele would be scheduled in Games 5, 6 and 7, respectively.</p>
        <p>Torre would not commit on his rotation beyond Game 4. He probably wants to see how Neagle reacts, how his three primary starters bounce back from the heavy workload in the first round. But Torre will have an obvious option of starting Hernandez on three days' rest in Game 5, then using Pettitte and Clemens.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, benched for three games in the first round before jump-starting the offense in Game 5,  dressed in street clothes at Yankee Stadium yesterday. Only a handful of his players appeared, and there was no formal workout, Torre opting to give his players a day off after they made cross-country flights on consecutive days.</p>
        <p>The Yankees must survive two more rounds of playoffs if they are to become the first team since the 1972-74 Oakland Athletics to win three consecutive championships. There is more work to be done. The Yankees accomplished an important part of the job in beating Oakland, extricating themselves from the late-season slump, coming back to win the series after losing Game 1, after losing Game 4 and having to fly across the country overnight to play the deciding game on the road.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have shown more joy in winning before -- when they won the World Series in 1996, and in 1998. But there was something different about the way they reacted after the tense Game 5 Sunday, something deep. It might be because they had more struggles, more reason to doubt themselves than at any time in Torre's tenure as manager. There was the slump, and the nagging injuries, and the slow erosion of skill that is inevitable with an older team. But the Yankees still prevailed. ''It seemed harder,'' Torre said after Game 5, his face glistening. ''It really did. Last night was such a tough time getting on that plane.''</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill said, ''We know what we accomplished the last couple of years, and we don't want to give it up, and we're going to fight.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees were a vulnerable team in the first round, and are again now; the Seattle Mariners possess vastly more experience than Oakland, and they don't make nearly as many mistakes on defense. But Torre's team seems to have restored its confidence in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''People want to write us off,'' said Derek Jeter, the shortstop. ''But until somebody beats us, we're the champions.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees might add the reliever JASON GRIMSLEY to their roster for the series against Seattle. Torre did not say who would be dropped off the roster if that were to happen, but it would appear that the most vulnerable would be DAVID CONE, who was not used in the first round, or outfielder LUIS POLONIA.</p>
