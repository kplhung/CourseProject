        <p>The European Union embraced Yugoslavia's new government today, lifting major sanctions and pledging to contribute about $2 billion in aid for rebuilding the shattered country.</p>
        <p>At a meeting in Luxembourg, the union's foreign ministers pushed aside some of the thornier issues that remain, such as whether to make any of the aid conditional on a pledge from the new government to turn former President Slobodan Milosevic over to the war crimes tribunal at The Hague.</p>
        <p>The group also put aside a request from the United Nations administrator in Kosovo to link the aid to the release of Kosovo Albanian prisoners who have been held in Yugoslavia since the  war in Kosovo last year.</p>
        <p>These were matters, the ministers insisted, that could be dealt with later. Instead, they said, it was time to deliver on a pledge to reward the Serbian people if they ousted Mr. Milosevic in an election.</p>
        <p>''We had a promise to the Serbian people'' said the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, who chaired the meeting. ''Today we kept that promise. The E.U. has radically revised its policy toward Yugoslavia.''</p>
        <p>The ministers agreed not only to lift some sanctions but also to free up about $300 million a year in aid during the next seven years.</p>
        <p>The ministers said that, as part of their possible assistance, they would study ways to reopen the Danube River quickly. It has been clogged with tons of debris left over from NATO's 78-day bombardment last year.</p>
        <p>The union also plans to invite Yugoslavia into a network of Balkan assistance programs, including a trade agreement that should allow duty-free access to European markets for most of Yugoslavia's exports.</p>
        <p>''We have to help the people of Serbia as soon as possible,'' said  Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany. ''We have waited long enough for democracy to prevail in Belgrade. We should not hesitate now, but intensify aid at all levels.''</p>
        <p>The Union decided to lift immediately an oil blockade and flight ban imposed on Yugoslavia last year as Mr. Milosevic's troops were in Kosovo purging the province of its Albanians. To some degree, the move is symbolic -- the flight ban had already been suspended and the oil embargo had badly eroded. European officials said the paperwork should be completed in a few days and the removal of the remaining restrictions should help lower the price of oil in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>But the foreign ministers said that the restrictions on moving financial assets out of Yugoslavia and a ban on visas for Mr. Milosevic, his family and his close associates would remain in place a while longer to make sure that Milosevic-linked elite did not flee the country with looted wealth.</p>
        <p>American officials say Washington will take comparable steps in coming days, but United States officials have also said that they intend to make sure that Mr. Kostunica is ready to adhere to all elements of the Dayton peace accords, which ended the Bosnian war, before Yugoslavia is completely welcomed back into the international community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vedrine is scheduled to fly to Belgrade on Tuesday to discuss  with President Vojislav Kostunicathe details of the aid offered. France, which currently holds the rotating European presidency, has already invited Mr. Kostunica to join European leaders at their next summit meeting, to be held in Biarritz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic, who was indicted by the United Nations tribunal for war crimes in Kosovo, has said he plans to stay in Yugoslavia and to try to rebuild his political party. Mr. Kostunica, who like many Serbs regards the tribunal as a political tool of the West, has said he will not send his adversary to The Hague for trial.</p>
        <p>But the ministers appeared unanimous in not wanting to press the issue today. ''I don't think that this is the time in which we should start expressing the conditionality of what we do today,'' said Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook.</p>
