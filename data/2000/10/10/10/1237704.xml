        <p>A two-hour meeting here today between the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, ended with Mr. Mubarak's conspicuously avoiding any public appeal for Mr. Arafat to bow to Israeli demands  to end Palestinian violence.</p>
        <p>Caught between American and Israeli demands that Egypt restrain the Palestinians and boiling anger across the Arab world at the heavy Palestinian casualties in 12 days of confrontation with Israeli troops and policemen in Gaza and the West Bank, Mr. Mubarak acted like a man walking a tightrope. Behind the scenes, he worked feverishly to promote diplomatic solutions. In public, he gave solid support to Mr. Arafat and the Palestinians, and blamed the Israelis for the violence.</p>
        <p>But in all his actions, Mr. Mubarak left no doubt that he, like President Clinton and indeed virtually all the leading figures in the crisis, sees the clashes between the Israelis and the Palestinians as threatening a wider conflagration, one that could erupt into a new Arab-Israeli war. He spent much of the day on the telephone with other Arab leaders and Mr. Clinton, discussing possible diplomatic moves that could help head off a wider conflict.</p>
        <p>One of these, a meeting in Egypt between Mr. Clinton, Mr. Mubarak and the two principal antagonists, Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat, appeared to hang in the balance. Although Mr. Clinton appealed to Mr. Mubarak to host the meeting in a telephone call on Sunday, and suggested that it be held as early as the middle of the week, Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Mussa, said today that calling the meeting would be premature unless Israel gave assurances that it would end attacks on Palestinians -- a condition that appeared to turn Mr. Barak's demand for an end to Palestinian violence back on the Israeli leader.</p>
        <p>''There has to be a commitment that what happened in Gaza and the West Bank will not be repeated,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There were also signs that Mr. Mubarak was still smarting from events last week, when Mr. Barak boycotted a meeting between Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Arafat and Secretary of State Madeleine G. Albright in the Egypian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh that was held hours after Mr. Arafat had stormed out of a meeting with Mr. Barak and Dr. Albright at the American Embassy in Paris. For the moment, the Egyptian leader appeared to be investing much of his energy in arranging another meeting, of Arab leaders, that he has called for in Cairo on October 21 and 22. According to current plans, it will be the first Arab summit meeting since 1996, and the first since the Persian Gulf war a decade ago to be attended by Iraq, a pariah in most pan-Arab meetings for a decade.</p>
        <p>But even as Mr. Mubarak worked on diplomatic approaches, other Arab leaders continued to issue statements today that hinted at the possibility of war. Ominously, some of the harshest statements came from nations that have strong ties to the United States and had backed the American-led drive for peace.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdel Aziz, was quoted by the Saudi Press Agency as saying that Mr. Barak should not assume that Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations would stand by if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria. That possibility arises from a confrontation over three Israeli soldiers who were seized on Saturday by the Lebanon-based militant Islamic movement Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>''Barak must think carefully before making the slightest intolerable step,'' Prince Abdullah was quoted as saying in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.</p>
        <p>In the decades since Israel was founded, Arab nations, especially those that have avoided getting drawn directly into the four wars that have erupted since 1948, have often indulged in impassioned statements against Israel, then done little of practical significance. This time, too, there has been an amplitude of angry polemics, but no rush to get directly involved.</p>
        <p>Several Arab nations -- including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia -- have pledged to fly emergency medical supplies to the Palestinians and to evacuate Palestinian wounded. But even that effort has foundered in the face of an Israeli decision on Sunday to bar the flights by closing Gaza airport.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak has steered a course that appears to have been deeply influenced by past Arab experience of confrontations with Israel, almost all of which have ended with the Arab nations worse off. In his public statements, he has sought to ride, and perhaps calm, the wave of Arab anger, by associating himself with the outrage against Israel's actions. But on the diplomatic front, he has set himself firmly against any widening of the conflict, certainly one that would involve Egyptian forces.</p>
        <p>After the meeting with Mr. Arafat today, for example, Mr. Mubarak's spokesman summarized the discussion in a way that had the Egyptian leader laying all the blame for the violence on Israel, saying Mr. Mubarak had spoken of the need for ''intensive efforts'' to end Israeli attacks. There was no mention of Mr. Mubarak's having taken up Mr. Barak's request to help persuade Mr. Arafat to take actions that would ''restore complete calm in Israel and the West Bank as quickly as possible.''</p>
        <p>Publicly, at least, Mr. Mubarak also sided with Lebanon in the dispute over the captured Israeli soldiers. In an official transcript made available today of remarks Mr. Mubarak made to reporters on Sunday, he laid the blame for the incident on Israel. He said that when Israel ended its military occupation of southern Lebanon in May, ''it was agreed'' that 17 Lebanese citizens, apparently members of Hezbollah and other militant Islamic groups, would be released from Israeli prisons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak has also continued solidly backing Mr. Arafat in his refusal to accept American and Israeli proposals that would leave most of Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty in a final peace agreement, the issue that sparked the current crisis. On Sunday, he said that ''not a single Arab country'' would accept Israeli sovereignty over Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem, and he suggested that the problem could be solved with the concept of ''divine sovereignty'' over the Muslim and Jewish holy sites, with Palestinians being ''deputized'' to exercise the sovereignty.</p>
        <p>But he mocked suggestions that Arab nations have a military option, saying, ''Neither Israel nor its neighbors can afford a continuation of the drain of war.''</p>
        <p>Judging by some of the other political posturing during the day, the crisis appeared in some ways to have thrown the Middle East back to the period before 1978, when Egypt's decision to make peace with Israel began to recast the geo-political map. For instance, the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, visited Syria, Lebanon and later Gaza, and positioned Moscow solidly behind Mr. Arafat. He said Israeli forces should ''stop the violence against Palestinians,'' and attributed the crisis to the ''known provocation'' of the visit made to Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem on Sept. 28 by the Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the crisis has spawned a wave of hostility across the region for the United States, and not only from the crowds protesting in Arab capitals. In Egypt, where the government has partnered Washington in the peace effort for two decades, government-owned newspapers have run a wave of editorials and commentaries questioning the United States claim to be an honest broker between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
