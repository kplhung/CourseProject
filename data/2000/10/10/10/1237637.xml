        <p>Separated by the Gulf of Mexico, and a few ideological divides, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas stayed largely sequestered today as they prepared for the second of their three scheduled nationally televised debates.</p>
        <p>Both men returned to the debate camps where they had hunkered down with large teams of advisers to prepare for last week's debate.</p>
        <p>In anticipation of Wednesday's debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., Mr. Gore settled in for three days of practice at the Mote Marine Laboratory, a shark research and conference center near here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush gathered with advisers at his Texas ranch two hours north of Austin. He was to practice with Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who has played the role of Mr. Gore in rehearsals. On the Democratic side, the political strategist and television commentator Paul Begala played Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>As the candidates rehearsed, their surrogates continued a war of words that intensified on Sunday, when Gore aides characterized Mr. Bush as ''bumbling and babbling'' and Bush aides called Mr. Gore a ''serial exaggerator.''</p>
        <p>Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, held a news conference here to unveil plans to use television advertisements, Web sites and roadshows to criticize Mr. Bush's record in Texas and his occasional difficulties in explaining his policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrew said the assault on the Bush record would focus on air pollution in Houston and Odessa, poverty along the Mexican border, problems with the Medicaid program for poor children and Mr. Bush's opposition to hate-crimes legislation.</p>
        <p>''He has led this state backward,'' Mr. Andrew said.</p>
        <p>Asked by reporters why Texas voters had re-elected Mr. Bush by a margin of 38 percentage points in 1998 if he had done such a bad job, Mr. Andrew laid the blame at the campaign run by his own party's candidate that year, Garry Mauro.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, he had an opponent who was not able even to get a message out,'' Mr. Andrew said. ''He had very few dollars on TV and was not able to draw these kinds of contrasts that we're drawing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrew also said it was ''fair game'' to attack Mr. Bush's verbal gaffes, which he said demonstrated that Mr. Bush ''simply does not have the experience we believe to be up to a presidential standard.'' But he tried to draw distinctions between those attacks and the Republican criticism of Mr. Gore's misstatements, which he described as ''character assassination.''</p>
        <p>In response, Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, predicted that ''the American people would rather have a president who occasionally mispronounces words compared to a president who has a long history of exaggerating and embellishing his history.''</p>
        <p>And the Bush campaign issued a statement by a Democratic state senator from Texas, Ken Armbrister, accusing Mr. Gore of breaking his pledge to avoid personal attacks.</p>
        <p>While preparing for the debate, Mr. Gore made a conference call to his so-called special advisers, people from around the country who were flown here by the campaign last week to help him prepare for the first debate but have not returned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's only diversion today was a trip to a bookstore, where he bought the novels ''Open House,'' by Elizabeth Berg, and ''Sick Puppy,'' by Carl Hiaasen, and a children's book, ''The Adventures of Pelican Pete,'' for his grandson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore plans to stay in Florida until flying to Winston-Salem on Wednesday, but he will give a speech on education in the Sarasota area on Tuesday. Mr. Bush plans to attend a rally on Tuesday in Tennessee, Mr. Gore's home state, where a recent poll showed Mr. Bush leading. After the debate, Mr. Bush plans to travel to Pennsylvania and Michigan, while Mr. Gore plans stops in Milwaukee; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Detroit.</p>
        <p>The third and final presidential debate will be on Oct. 17 in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: PREPARING FOR DEBATES  Correction:  October 19, 2000, Thursday  A picture caption on Oct. 10 about a campaign stop in Florida by Vice President Al Gore, before he shopped on a break from debate practice, misidentified the location of the appearance.
