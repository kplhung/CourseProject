        <p>Several hundred Jews, apparently tired of feeling trapped for 12 days in this predominantly Arab city, rampaged on Sunday night, attacking Arab homes and touching off a melee in which the Israeli police killed two Arabs, more than a dozen Arab witnesses said.</p>
        <p>The troubles began shortly after evening religious services for Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, when Jews swept through Arab neighborhoods shouting, ''Death to Arabs!'' hurling stones through windows and attacking Arabs.</p>
        <p>Arabs who live here, and hold Israeli citizenship, turned to the Israeli police. But when they arrived, the Arabs said, the police also turned on the Arabs, leading to a confrontation in which two Arab youths were killed.</p>
        <p>The struggle, in a town frequented by Christian pilgrims as the home of Jesus, underscored the dangerous extent to which the new Israeli-Palestinian clashes have swept up Jews and Arabs in Israel proper, where one million Arabs hold citizenship.</p>
        <p>Today, Arab towns in northern Israel were scenes of additional clashes between Arabs and Jews. Israeli Arabs in Shefaram set fires in the city, damaged religious artifacts in the ancient synagogue and uprooted traffic lights. Hundreds of demonstrators from other parts of northern Israel also rioted today.</p>
        <p>In a statement today after the outbreak in Nazareth, Prime Minister Ehud Barak condemned the violence and instructed the police to act resolutely to put an immediate end to it.</p>
        <p>When the police arrived, they found groups of Israeli Arabs backed into alleys and throwing rocks at the Jewish demonstrators who were attacking the Arab area. The police pulled the Jewish protesters across the road and fired on the Arab crowd, shooting dead Wisam Hamdan Yazbak, 25, and Umar Mohammed Akkawi, 42, according to witnesses.</p>
        <p>Just a day before, the police blocked a group of Jews from marching into the neighborhood. On Sunday, for reasons that were unclear, the police apparently let the protesters through.</p>
        <p>Over and over, Israeli Arabs, who often speak Hebrew as well as they speak Arabic, said they expected the police to help them.</p>
        <p>''It did not occur to us that the police would get to the scene, see what was happening and side with the thugs who were attacking our homes and beating people randomly,'' said Jalal Hassan, 39. ''It was a message from the Israeli state to all of us: 'You are not really citizens. You do not belong here.' ''</p>
        <p>Azmi Bishara, 46, an Arab member of Parliament whose house in the Jewish section of Nazareth was attacked on Saturday night by Jews, said: ''I fear this will erupt into an intercommunal war between Jews and Arabs. This is in no one's interest. But it may be impossible to stop.''</p>
        <p>Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben Ami, who is also acting foreign minister, said the Nazareth demonstration was ''intolerable in a country of law.''</p>
        <p>''We have to enforce the law on Jews and Arabs alike,'' he said. ''I appeal to the Jews and the Arabs, principally in the north, that they understand that the delicate fabric of life is a joint responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Today, Nazareth had the feel of a West Bank town under siege. All shops were shuttered and closed. Fliers in Hebrew called for Jews to boycott all Arab stores. Palestinian groups have instructed followers to stone Israeli vehicles that move in and out of the upper part of Nazareth.</p>
        <p>Thousands of people clogged the main artery this morning bearing the bodies of the two slain men. The crowd chanted nationalist Palestinian slogans and ''God is Great!'' as they pumped their fists in the air. Black flags of mourning, green banners with Arabic script and Palestinian flags fluttered above them.</p>
        <p>''We have religious fanatics, and they have religious fanatics,'' Dr. Khalil Warwar, an Israeli Arab dentist. ''These fanatics do things to make each group fear the other. But if the Israeli police refuse to intervene, if it allows Jewish fanatics to do this kind of thing, where do they think the Palestinians will turn for help? This will only lead people into an endless struggle for revenge.''</p>
        <p>The Jews who live in the dun-colored stone houses on the eastern ridge, Nazareth-Illit, are no less beleaguered. Some 51,000 residents, all but 15 percent Jews, say that since the violence began they have been virtual prisoners because of Arab attacks along the four roads out of the area. Two roads, including the main road to Tiberias, northeast of here, are shut, and stone-throwing Arab youths have attacked the other two.</p>
        <p>''People feel trapped,'' Mayor Menachem Ariav of Nazareth-Illit said. ''Tensions on Sunday night, after evening services, caused people to explode. But the Arabs are just as much to blame. They confronted us. As for the shooting of the two Arabs, we do not know what happened, because their families will not permit autopsies. The police have told us they did not use live ammunition, but fired rubber bullets.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Ramez Jaraisi of Nazareth, an Arab, said: ''The aggressors were treated with kid gloves. They didn't have even a single canister of tear gas fired at them. At the same time, the police fired on Nazareth and on the demonstrators who came out to defend their homes tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition.</p>
        <p>''The two nations are going to continue living together. The question is how. There will be coexistence. The question is what kind of coexistence.''</p>
        <p>After the burials, clusters of young Arab men and a few women approached an Israeli checkpoint, in the upper part of the city where the Jewish residents live, and lobbed rocks toward the police.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, each side feels besieged and trapped by the other.</p>
        <p>''For 50 years, we have lived together, yet I do not believe the Jews really know anything about us,'' said Obour Rizeq, 26, a social worker, who as with most city workers has not been paid for two months. ''We do not receive the same economic or political benefits. Most Israelis view us a primitive and backward. Young men cannot find work. Nearly half of all Arabs in Nazareth live below the poverty line. And when we turn for help, the police side with criminals because they are Jews. Why is anyone amazed that everything has exploded?''</p>
