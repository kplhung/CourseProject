        <p>Clinton Campaign Changes Its Tune</p>
        <p>Apparently, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'S campaign recognizes the power of suggestion.</p>
        <p>For a rally on Sunday in Auburn, N.Y., her campaign hired a D.J., PHIL DELASSANDRO of Syracuse, to pick and play the music. Tina Turner's ''Simply the Best'' was fine, as were Sister Sledge's ''We Are Family'' and the Bee Gees' ''Stayin' Alive.''</p>
        <p>But when Donna Summer's ''She Works Hard for the Money'' began blasting from Mr. Delassandro's speakers, RAY OCASIO, who was working on Mrs. Clinton's advance staff, shouted, ''Cut! Cut!'' He had Mr. Delassandro stop the compact disc in the middle of the song. Soon, ''What's On Your Mind'' by Information Society was playing.</p>
        <p>No one from Mrs. Clinton's campaign would comment on why Mr. Ocasio had ordered ''She Works Hard for the Money'' halted or whether the campaign was concerned that someone in the crowd would think that playing the song was a commentary on the fund-raisers she attends.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a jewelry-store owner in Schenectady, N.Y., all but offered CHELSEA CLINTON a job. (What he said was, ''If you need a job after college,'' and his voice trailed off.)</p>
        <p>So what is Ms. Clinton -- who was campaigning with her mother -- going to do after college?</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure actually,'' she said. ''A few ideas, a few ideas. Oxford, economics.'' Then she and Mrs. Clinton left the store.</p>
        <p>With help from the New York City Board of Elections, the producers of the Broadway play ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man' '' set up a real voting booth in the lobby of the Virginia Theater on Oct. 11. People attending the play could step in and pull levers for the candidates they preferred in the presidential campaign and the New York Senate race.</p>
        <p>What the Board of Elections lends, the Board of Elections takes away. It carted the voting machine off the other day to be used at a real polling place next week. But the producers kept track, and said that of 1,200 theatergoers who voted, 75 percent voted for Vice President Al Gore and 25 percent for Gov. George W. Bush. As for the Senate race, 68 percent chose Mrs. Clinton; 32 percent her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''Every night there were lines at the voting booth, longer lines than for the men's and ladies' rooms,'' said JEFFREY RICHARDS, a producer of the play.</p>
        <p>Good Golf Courses Are Hard to Find</p>
        <p>It was the kind of party where, at the mogul table, HARVEY WEINSTEIN of Miramax could be heard asking JEFFREY KATZENBERG of DreamWorks, ''Have you met Bobby Kennedy?''</p>
        <p>Chances are that Mr. Katzenberg had, since he and ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (a lawyer for Riverkeeper, an environmental group) were among the co-chairmen of the party, which benefited the Natural Resources Defense Council. Other co-chairmen included the movie stars MATT DAMON and CHARLIZE THERON, who appear in ROBERT REDFORD'S  period golf movie ''The Legend of Bagger Vance.'' Mr. Redford was honorary chairman.</p>
        <p>The connection between ecologically unfriendly golf and defending natural resources?</p>
        <p>For one thing, the movie is set in the 1920's, when golf courses were more natural looking -- so much so that Mr. Redford said he had a hard time finding a course that looked like one from that period. He ended up relying on cinematography and digital trickery (but ''not as much as you think,'' he said).</p>
        <p>The 13-year-old star of ''Bagger Vance,'' L. MICHAEL MONCRIEF, does not have another movie in the works, ''but I'm reading scripts,'' he said. He turned. ''Ma!'' he said. ''Who's my agent?''</p>
        <p>A Cryptic Briton Takes in Uptown</p>
        <p>After touring Harlem yesterday, PRINCE ANDREW said one word when he was asked for his impression of the neighborhood: ''Fascinating.''</p>
        <p>Then he jumped into the back seat of his hunter-green Bentley and sped down Lenox Avenue without explaining what he had meant.</p>
        <p>Earlier, at the headquarters of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a federal, state and city program designed to foster economic development in Harlem, he had used three words to describe the trip to Harlem, his first: ''A tremendous privilege.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Prince Andrew, DAVID TUCK, said that the prince was interested in economic development and was involved in a community initiative program in Yorkshire that was working to help regenerate neighborhoods there.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a minibus took Prince Andrew to Harlem landmarks like 125th Street and the 369th Regiment Armory.</p>
        <p>There he met ROSCOE C. BROWN, a former president of Bronx Community College who served with the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the black bomber and fighter pilots who had their own unit in the segregated Army in World War II.</p>
        <p>''You wouldn't know he's a prince unless they told you,'' Mr. Brown said. ''He literally seemed excited about being in Harlem.''</p>
