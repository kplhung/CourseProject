        <p>For 20 years I treated overweight patients who also had emotional problems. I found group therapy effective (''Watching Volunteers: Experts Seek Clues to Eating Disorders,'' Oct. 24).</p>
        <p>Eating should be a pleasure, and group members were encouraged to eat with their families. Exercise, especially walking, was a must.</p>
        <p>Watching caloric and fat intake was to be observed. No other diet was to be followed, no drugs to be taken unless under medical supervision. The path to successful weight reduction and maintenance of that loss was dealing with the emotional component, exercising faithfully and watching food intake -- but also enjoying eating sensibly -- at home, not in restaurants.</p>
        <p>The success rate was good, so long as the patient got help with the emotional problems, continued to exercise and followed the needed caloric intake. This is not as onerous as it perhaps reads.</p>
