        <p>THERE is an unmistakable air of incompleteness as the Knicks begin their season, and we are not talking about Luc Longley's being out or Patrick Ewing's moving on. More than anything, this team is a work in progress, if not regress.</p>
        <p>Twenty years around Madison Square Garden tells me the corporation can't possibly be content with this nice little team that not a single Baldwin brother could consider a plausible title contender. Actually, don't take my word for it.

        <p>THERE is an unmistakable air of incompleteness as the Knicks begin their season, and we are not talking about Luc Longley's being out or Patrick Ewing's moving on. More than anything, this team is a work in progress, if not regress.</p>
        <p>Twenty years around Madison Square Garden tells me the corporation can't possibly be content with this nice little team that not a single Baldwin brother could consider a plausible title contender. Actually, don't take my word for it. Scott Layden, the normally covert general manager, has been a regular Dave Checketts lately, regarding the team's interest in Joe Smith, the spindly power forward who may or may not return to the mess in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>''I think it'll come down to how much money he can get,'' reported Latrell Sprewell, the self-appointed director of player personnel, after the Knicks practiced yesterday for tonight's Garden opener against the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>
        <p>In Sprewell's grand vision, the Knicks would forget about Dikembe Mutombo and, in the coming months, become Golden State East. They would acquire Smith and then Chris Webber, another former Warriors running mate whose case Sprewell said he was on during training camp.</p>
        <p>Having replaced Ewing now as the Knicks' lightning-rod player, Sprewell brings a calculated candidness to the interview process, and who, after Ewing, could complain about that? The problem is that for all the logical proclamations that this is Sprewell's team, there is also the contention that for the Knicks to make a serious deal, sooner or later, he may also be their most legitimate trade bait.</p>
        <p>Allan Houston has leverage, a contractual out after the season. Glen Rice is 33 years old, with a new long-term deal. Sorry, callers, the package of Erick Strickland and Travis Knight may not be tempting enough for Ted Turner's people in Atlanta to send back Mutombo and the autographed photo of Jane Fonda from ''Klute.''</p>
        <p>It's too late, too pointless, as Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy mentioned, to second-guess the Ewing deal, now that Miami's Alonzo Mourning is out for the season and Indiana no longer has Rik Smits's aching feet. With a healthy Ewing, the Knicks would have had a better chance in the East. But don't forget: last spring, they were destroyed on the boards in the conference finals by Dale Davis, who, in turn, looked like Van Gundy on the leg of Mourning in the finals against Shaq.</p>
        <p>The end of the Ewing era, for the most part, has cost the Knicks their illusion of contention. They weren't going to beat a Western Conference champion with him. They won't win a title without him, or not with this collection of perimeter players and passable point guards. Following their Men at Work decade, it promises to be a strange team that many nights, especially when the jump shots are falling, will surely be more pleasing to the aesthetic eye.</p>
        <p>''Just because Patrick's not here doesn't mean we've changed,'' Sprewell countered when I asked if the Knicks would retain their familiar work ethic. Don't confuse that with style, with how the Knicks attack, fast or slow, an overused debate. Work ethic begins in practice, with the stars establishing themselves as positive influences on others. Sprewell, Houston and Rice have never carried the burden, or not to the extent they must now.</p>
        <p>''I have to lead by example,'' Sprewell said, which, for Van Gundy's sake, hopefully means he intends to rein in his tardy side.</p>
        <p>However one saw Ewing, no one could claim he didn't come to play and practice, at least until he was hurt. He and Charles Oakley set the rules that served Pat Riley and Van Gundy well. These Knicks may have more firepower than before, but without that core quality, they will wind up as first-round road kill, like the better Golden State teams Sprewell played on.</p>
        <p>The corporation, already suffering with another distressing Rangers start, is watching. Preseason Knicks attendance was eye opening, and the equally sparse gathering of reporters at the team's practice site yesterday was reflective of the city's baseball obsession but perhaps also of a lack of chutzpah to overpromote the Knicks as something they are most obviously not.</p>
        <p>There is the sense that another shoe will drop, which Checketts and Van Gundy haven't exactly denied to the public and players.</p>
        <p>The coach said he used words like ''transient'' and ''high turnover profession'' in his welcome-back address this month to a team that had just jettisoned its career leading scorer. The reality of an era's ending, of the Knicks' still being title-less for 27 years, is that change is inevitable, and it's only just begun.</p>
