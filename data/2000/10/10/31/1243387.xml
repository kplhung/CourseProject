        <p>Primedia, the magazine conglomerate controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, agreed yesterday to buy About.com, one of New York City's largest Internet companies, for $690 million in stock.</p>
        <p>The deal's partners both serve a sprawling and eclectic list of specialized interests. Primedia has a few big titles including New York magazine and Seventeen, but it has largely collected about 100 enthusiast magazines, like Cats and Hot Bike, and 90 industrial trade publications, like Fire Chief and Coal Age.</p>
        <p>About, formed in 1996 as the Mining Company, is a Web guide created by independent, mostly part-time guides who earn a share of the site's advertising. It now comprises more than 700 sites on topics from astrology to woodworking. It has steadily gained traffic and now reaches 60 million people a month, the seventh-largest audience on the Web.</p>
        <p>The company, initially focused on subjects of consumer interest, has been expanding into business topics, some of which match Primedia's trade titles, like waste management</p>
        <p>Thomas S. Rogers, the chief executive of Primedia, said About would become the platform for the Internet operations of all its properties as the magazine content is integrated into About's structure. He said the biggest benefit would come when the 1,600 people in Primedia's sales force sell ads for areas of About  related to their specialties. With only 100 people in its sales force, About has not been able to take advantage of the advertising opportunities created by its wide range of topics.</p>
        <p>''We are creating the single largest leader in niche-targeted media,'' Mr. Rogers said.</p>
        <p>The deal is remarkable for what at other times would be ordinary: a big media company buying a successful upstart.</p>
        <p>Yet over the last few years, traditional media conglomerates have not been willing to outbid frenzied stock market traders for Internet companies they otherwise coveted. That led companies like Disney and NBC to structure complex joint ventures with Internet start-ups to avoid outright acquisitions. And when Internet stocks reached their high early this year, America Online was able to obtain agreement to buy the largest media company, Time Warner, even though it was four times AOL's size.</p>
        <p>Like other Internet stocks, shares of About.com have fallen 75 percent since March. Yet it has grown to be a thriving business; as a stand-alone business next year, it had been expected to turn profitable on a forecast of $170 million in sales.</p>
        <p>As a result, while the price Primedia is paying is hardly cheap, analysts say, it is not out of line with that in other media acquisitions.</p>
        <p>''Valuations have compressed so dramatically that the price they are paying, as a multiple of cash flow, is actually less than the multiple on Primedia's own stock,'' said Peter P. Appert, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. Mr. Appert said the deal was sound strategically because it would increase the growth rate of Primedia's cash flow to 20 percent a year from 9 percent. The companies said they hoped to find $23 million in increased revenue and $49 million in cost savings in the first 12 months after the transaction is completed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers said the deal would eliminate few jobs, as much of the savings involves putting off Primedia's planned hiring next year. About.com plans to keep its new office space at Broadway and West 40th Street. Some 350 of About's 500 employees are in New York, and 2,500 of Primedia's 6,000 employees are in the New York area.</p>
        <p>Scott P. Kurnit, the founder and chief executive of About, said the company had the business momentum and cash to survive as a stand-alone company, but it nonetheless began to consider being acquired about six weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''We said what things are different about the world today,'' he said. ''We wanted to be bigger and have capital-markets mass.'' About had discussions with an number of parties, Mr. Kurnit said, declining to identify them, before settling last week on the deal with Primedia.</p>
