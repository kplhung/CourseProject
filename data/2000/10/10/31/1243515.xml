        <p>The triumphal parade was underway. Helicopters were hovering. Paper was pouring from the skies. And there was Yusra Awawdeh, standing practically in the middle of Broadway.</p>
        <p>There was this little problem, though: She was at Broadway and Canal Street. And the only reason she was standing in the middle of Broadway was that she was below it. Underground. In the N and R subway station.</p>
        <p>And try as she did, there seemed to be no way to get up into the light anywhere near the parade.</p>
        <p>''Oh my God, y'all, the floats are already going!'' yelled Ms. Awawdeh, a student on what might be called a self-directed field trip yesterday from a high school she did not want to name.</p>
        <p>It was 12:30 in the afternoon. The parade was passing into memory somewhere above. Ms. Awawdeh had written ''Jeter'' and ''No. 2'' on her cheeks with a ballpoint pen. And not only that, she and four friends had left with what they thought was plenty of time to get downtown and stake out a nice place to watch baseball history.</p>
        <p>They were so very wrong, and they had plenty of company, all of it jammed into the subway.</p>
        <p>''We go up, and the cops stop us and tell us that if we want to get near, we've got to walk down two blocks and then turn in,'' said Derek Torres, one of Ms. Awawdeh's classmates. ''So we go two blocks and then the cops tell us the same thing there. We're missing it, man.''</p>
        <p>It seemed almost like a parallel universe in the subway yesterday, where everything was working in reverse. By noon, when the parade started, the trains themselves were not crowded at all. Everyone on board had a seat. People stretched out, read their newspapers.</p>
        <p>But the City Hall station on the N and R line was closed, and the platforms and stairways in the Cortlandt and Canal stations were packed with people trying to push, prod, wheedle, cajole and charm their way from the exits and up into the streets, as packed as rush-hour trains. When the police kept them from getting any closer to the parade, they trickled back downstairs and took the train one more stop up, or one more stop down, searching for any breach in the fortifications. That was the essentially doomed tactic that Mr. Torres, Ms. Awawdeh and their friends decided to try, after getting nowhere in the streets.</p>
        <p>Mary Taylor and Connie Colbert, who work for the city's Human Resources Administration in Brooklyn, were trying to get to a building on Broadway where friends were holding a little party with a parade view.</p>
        <p>But at the Cortlandt Street station, a token booth clerk told them there was no way they could cross Broadway during the parade to get to the building entrance. She explained that the best way to get where they wanted would be to head north, transfer, transfer again, head south and hope for the best, during which time they would probably miss most of the parade. A few minutes after noon, Ms. Taylor and Ms. Colbert decided to take their chances in the street.</p>
        <p>''We're going to pray a lot,'' Ms. Taylor said. ''And say 'excuse me' a lot. And smile a lot. And we're going to pretend like we're Yankees fans.''</p>
        <p>Maria Masi and Heather Mathis looked even more frustrated, and they deserved to. They had flown from Atlanta to catch the parade. Ms. Mathis, standing on the subway platform, summed up how much they saw: ''We saw a couple of buses. We don't know who was on them. We didn't see any confetti.''</p>
        <p>Amarjid Sindh was frustrated, too. And he could not have cared less about any baseball parade. He was just trying to deliver a turkey sandwich, some potato salad and a Pepsi from his deli to 40 Wall Street. He was not a man of many words yesterday.</p>
        <p>''40 Wall Street,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''No way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Right about then, a tired-looking suburbanite walked by with his sad-looking young daughter in tow. They were going to make one last attempt to assail the crowd upstairs.</p>
        <p>The man leaned down to offer a little comfort to his daughter: ''Some people do this every day, honey.''</p>
