        <p>Two clients are reconsidering their ties to the Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising unit of Young &amp; Rubicam in New York, owned by the WPP Group.</p>
        <p>Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications company, is reviewing its worldwide consumer creative account, which has been handled by offices of Y.&amp; R. Advertising about five years. Billings were estimated at $80 million to $100 million.</p>
        <p>Kathy Egan, a spokeswoman for the Ericsson American operations in New York, confirmed a report of the review this week in Advertising Age. Relationships with other units of Y.&amp; R. would not be affected by the review, she said; they include Media Edge, which handles media buying, and Impiric, which handles direct marketing. The London office of Publicis Worldwide, part of Publicis Groupe, handles the corporate image account for Ericsson.</p>
        <p>And the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is considering hiring a new lead agency on its account after more than 20 years at Y.&amp; R. Advertising. Spending was estimated at $50 million.</p>
        <p>''We're open to new ideas,'' said Kevin Foley, a MetLife spokesman in New York, confirming a report this week in Adweek, ''but we're not in a heated rush to change a very established brand and image.'' Y.&amp; R. Advertising created the campaign for MetLife featuring the ''Peanuts'' characters and carrying the theme ''Get Met. It pays.''</p>
        <p>Philippe Krakowsky, a spokesman for Y.&amp; R., referred inquiries to Ericsson and MetLife.</p>
        <p>THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA  Correction:  November 1, 2000, Wednesday  An entry in the Addenda listing on the Media Business page yesterday about Ericsson and MetLife, which are reconsidering their ties to Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising, referred imprecisely to remarks by Kevin Foley, a MetLife spokesman. While he commented on a report in Adweek, that said the company was beginning a review for its account, he did not confirm such a review.</p>
