        <p>For the Palestinian residents of this hardscrabble village, the shooting deaths here of two brothers in a confrontation with Israeli soldiers was proof that Israelis no longer hesitate to pull the trigger on unarmed civilians.</p>
        <p>For the Israeli Army, the killings were an aberration, caused by the reckless provocation of two young men, but turned into tragedy by what a military spokesman suggested may have been an inappropriate use of live ammunition.</p>
        <p>For their mother, the simultaneous loss of her two youngest sons  was an unfathomable family trauma. Bilal and Hilal Salah, 19 and 21, ''were like twins,'' she said after their burial here today. ''They did everything together. They even kept their secrets together.''</p>
        <p>One secret the young men kept from their mother was their new nightly habit of joining friends on the rocky edge of this hilltop village and hurling stones at cars headed to a Jewish settlement on the road below.</p>
        <p>Israeli soldiers guarding the settlement had routinely repelled the rock-throwing assaults with tear gas and rubber-coated steel pellets, said friends of the two young men who gathered this afternoon on the site where the Salah brothers died.</p>
        <p>But on Sunday night, they said, the response was bullets. The soldiers who fired the weapons were clearly visible on the road below, a few hundred feet away, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>An Israeli Army spokesman suggested tonight that the Yabed shooting may have exceeded the army's guidelines. In a rare acknowledgment of internal military debate about the use of lethal force in the current conflict, he said there were unresolved questions about the Salahs' deaths.</p>
        <p>''What we know is that there was a violent incident with the throwing of stones, and perhaps of other things, that the response was rubber bullets, tear gas, and live ammunition too, and we have two dead Palestinians,'' said Yarden Vatikai, an Israeli Army spokesman. ''We are checking into this event to see if the shooting was adequate for these circumstances, to see if it was the best response.''</p>
        <p>Palestinians see such responses as evidence that the Israeli Army is carrying out its announced intent to adopt tougher retaliatory tactics against what it terms life-threatening attacks. Helicopter missile attacks tonight against the West Bank offices of Yasir Arafat's Fatah faction were viewed as further proof a much harder Israeli line.</p>
        <p>''We hear the Israeli radio reports here, too, and we know that this is deliberate,'' said Machmoud Bejawi, a paramedic with the Palestine Red Crescent Society who helped put Hilal Salah into an ambulance here on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>In statements by senior military commanders and press reports about Defense Ministry meetings, the Israeli military has recently signaled its resolve to take tougher action against snipers and others it says have repeatedly attacked Israeli forces and civilian settlements. The army plans to ''move from a pattern of solely reacting, to one of initiative,'' Gen. Sahul Mofaz, the chief of staff, said Sunday.</p>
        <p>The statements were welcomed by Jewish settlers and other Israelis who have been urging a greater use of army firepower in the West Bank and Gaza. West Bank hospital directors and Red Crescent officials assert that a new Israeli Army policy is already in place. They say that the casualties they have seen indicate an increasing use of live ammunition and a rising proportion of injuries to the head and upper body, an indication of more studied marksmanship.</p>
        <p>Nearly half of the 138 Palestinians who have died in the past month's conflict were shot in the head or the neck, Mustafa Bharghouti, director of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Medical Relief Committee, said today.</p>
        <p>''It is a very clear indicator that the Israeli Army is shooting to kill,''  he said. ''They are not acting as soldiers. They are acting as assassins.''</p>
        <p>Israeli officers, however, say that they are under strict orders to limit casualties.</p>
        <p>Army commanders have been contacting their Palestinian counterparts -- sometimes directly, sometimes through intermediaries, including American government agents in the field -- to try to prevent injuries by arranging the evacuation of residents from buildings that have been targeted for Israeli attack. There are also indications that in larger urban confrontations with Palestinians, the army has recently relied more on tear gas and concussive but nonlethal stun grenades, and less on automatic weapons fire.</p>
        <p>But if an Israeli officer believes that the lives of his men or the lives of Israeli civilians are in any direct danger, he has full authorization to order lethal force, military officials stress. ''We will shoot to kill, and if they have weapons we don't wait for them to shoot first,'' said one officer.</p>
        <p>In contrast to most such recent episodes, however, the Israeli Army is not contending that it was under fire in Yabed on Sunday night when its troops responded with live ammunition.</p>
        <p>The town of Yabed is in a zone of the West Bank where Palestinians run municipal services but the Israeli Army retains full security control.</p>
        <p>The use of automatic rifles by Palestinians in the recent conflict in this intermediate-control zone has been relatively rare, the Israeli Army says.</p>
        <p>But rocks thrown at moving cars are potentially life-endangering, the army says, and soldiers can be ordered to shoot if they see no better way to stop it.</p>
