        <p>In the annual test of wills between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the schools chancellor over whether to skip school for the Yankee parade, it appears the mayor has won once again.</p>
        <p>''We give props to Giuliani because he said we could come out here today,'' said Starlin Peralta, 15, a ninth grader at Louis D. Brandeis High School on the Upper West Side, using a term of praise. ''Good looking out, G. Forget about that other guy.''</p>
        <p>The other guy, of course, is Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who demanded that students show up for school yesterday despite Mayor Giuliani's annual suggestion that students skip school to attend the parade.</p>
        <p>High school attendance slid to 71 percent from the usual 80 percent, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education. But high school attendance was not as low as it was last year, when it slid to 64 percent, she said. Middle school attendance fell two points from 90 percent, and elementary school attendance remained steady at 92 percent.</p>
        <p>But it is hard to say if students would have skipped school whether the mayor sanctioned it or not.</p>
        <p>Alvin Gyles, a ninth grader at Brandeis High, who lives in Brownsville, Brooklyn, said he would have skipped school even without the mayor's permission because he is a true-blue Yankee fan. But he, too, was grateful for the nod from Mr. Giuliani, though he does not respect his politics.</p>
        <p>''I'm representing my Panamanian brother, Mariano Rivera, Number 42,'' he said, taking off his jacket to reveal a Rivera jersey. ''Giuliani is cool for today, but on the other days, he be hating.''</p>
        <p>Pat Breen of Staten Island called St. Theresa School to tell administrators that her sons would be absent, she said. The twin boys, Robert and Michael, 12, stood on metal barricades moments before the parade to ensure they had a perfect spot. They stood at Broadway and Wall Street, near the New York Stock Exchange and Trinity Church.</p>
        <p>''The school seemed O.K. with it when I called this morning,' '' Mrs. Breen said. ''There are a lot of kids here. A few of their friends are here as well.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Scherel of Staten Island brought his son, Michael, 10, a fifth-grader at Public School 6, to the parade so that he could pay homage to his favorite baseball team.</p>
        <p>Michael, a shy boy, stood holding a roll of toilet paper waiting for the parade to start. It was about noon. He said he had to finish a book report so that his father would let him skip school to go to the parade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scherel, who works in the interior demolition business, said he had received a big surprise: ''My 14-year-old daughter is here. I've been to the last three parades. I didn't want her to be part of it. I told her to go to school. I turned around about 10:30 and saw her with her friends. She was in shock. She said, 'Mom said it was O.K.' We'll see about that. It's a small world, you know.''</p>
