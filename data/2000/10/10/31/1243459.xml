        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Ralph Nader's rationale for running (letter, Oct. 29) may be, like his indictment of both parties, not only in vain but also counterproductive. I had admired his persistence in working for consumer and environmental causes, but for him to lump the two-party candidates together without any practical concern for their real differences is to set back his own agenda four to eight years or more.</p>

        <p>I would respect Mr. Nader if he dropped out of the presidential race and ran for the House or the Senate and thus addressed those issues more directly. His remaining in the race will sabotage the causes that he has so long espoused and worked for.</p>
