        <p>When it made its debut in February, the new late-evening newscast on Chicago's CBS station, WBBM-TV, was met with words that are rarely, if ever, applied to local news. It was called bold, serious, substantial.</p>
        <p>In a city that consumes news the way Philadelphia consumes cheesesteaks, the station's executives were betting that it could crawl out of last place by offering a no-frills, late news program without all the flash and sensationalism that has generally given the genre a bad name.</p>
        <p>But ultimately, it seems, the high road was a dead end.</p>
        <p>Amid poor ratings that showed no sign of improvement, WBBM announced yesterday that the experiment was over. It said it would go back to showing a more traditional evening news program starting tonight.</p>
        <p>WBBM-TV's move had been watched closely by stations around the country, many of whom are seeking to stem a steady decline in the local news audience. Although some critics faulted the execution, not the concept, of the program, the experiment's failure could be taken as reaffirmation that a serious format cannot succeed -- that people need to be drawn in through celebrity gossip and miracle diets introduced by bubbly anchormen and anchorwomen.</p>
        <p>It was just those sorts of things that WBBM's ''The 10 O'Clock News'' so publicly disavowed.</p>
        <p>Gone were segments on the latest diet craze and ways to stay beautiful longer and the happy chat of a standard, male-female anchor team. No longer, its producers said, would there be the typical closing shots of water-skiing squirrels and surfing dogs.</p>
        <p>Instead, the program featured a lone anchorwoman, Carol Marin, who delivered the news without pomp on a new, somewhat muted and dark set. Segments were longer. There were more investigative reports on complicated subjects like predatory loan practices. National and international stories were featured more prominently.</p>
        <p>But despite an immediate and brief rise in the ratings, the program began to sink.</p>
        <p>During the July sweeps, the most recent period for which exhaustive rating measurements were available, the program's overall audience was about 20 percent smaller than that of the program it replaced. It lost considerable ground in its audience between the ages of 25 and 54, an important group for advertisers.</p>
        <p>''When you see drop-off like that, change is inevitable,'' said Walter DeHaven, the WBBM vice president and general manager.</p>
        <p>Starting tonight, he said, Ms. Marin would be replaced by a temporary, male-female anchor team. They will report the news from a brighter, more traditional-looking setting.</p>
        <p>In fact, he said, the program would, for the most part, look more like those that are shown elsewhere around the country.</p>
        <p>But, he said, it would not become sensationalist and would seek a middle ground. Mr. DeHaven said the program failed because it was ''very, very stern,'' and was not appealing to viewers.</p>
        <p>''We're still trying to provide quality, hard-hitting journalism,'' he said. ''We just have to adjust as we go along, to make sure that the style and tone are in line with what people find pleasing today.''</p>
        <p>He said Ms. Marin had been invited to stay on but that she declined.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marin said the program could have found an audience. ''I wish we had been given more time,'' she said. ''I understand that I don't own it, and I don't run it, and so they get to decide.''</p>
        <p>Carl Gottlieb, deputy director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a study group in Washington, said he did not think that the program's failure should mean it should not be tried again.</p>
        <p>He blamed its demise on its refusal to make any effort to entice viewers.</p>
        <p>''I think that the failing was that they didn't take the important news and make it palatable to the viewer,'' he said.</p>
