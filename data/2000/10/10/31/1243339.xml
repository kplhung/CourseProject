        <p>Scientists have taken their closest look yet at the asteroid 433 Eros, maneuvering a robot spacecraft to within three miles of its rocky surface to see details of its battered origins.</p>
        <p>With the precision of an expert fly fisherman, engineers controlling the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft snapped it into a looping orbit that sent it skimming to within three miles of the asteroid's surface last Thursday.</p>
        <p>This tricky pass of the 21-mile-long potato-shaped space rock, with the robot craft swooping by as the asteroid tumbled end to end, produced the most precise images yet of surface features bearing clues of its ancient beginnings, scientists said.</p>
        <p>''We've never seen the surface of an asteroid or planetary satellite at this high resolution without actually landing,'' said Dr. Scott L. Murchie, a member of the project's imaging team at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., which manages the mission for NASA.</p>
        <p>During the dive over Eros, scientists say the spacecraft took pictures with its digital camera at resolutions three to four times as detailed as previous images. The pictures showed a highly cratered landscape with massive boulders and smooth-looking areas filled with dust and debris. The smallest visible rocks in the pictures were about five feet across.</p>
        <p>The robot spacecraft, called NEAR for Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, went into orbit around Eros on Feb. 14 for a one-year mission to study one of these primordial bodies in unprecedented detail. Loaded with six instruments to determine the mass, density, chemical composition and other characteristics of an asteroid, the $224 million NEAR was the first in a series of low-cost Discovery missions sponsored by NASA for exploring the solar system.</p>
        <p>Eros, named after the Greek god of physical love, is the largest of the so-called near-Earth asteroids whose orbits bring them very near the path Earth follows around the Sun. Discovered in 1898, Eros is 21 miles long, 8 miles wide and about 8 miles thick. It is variously described as being shaped like a potato, an unshelled peanut, a shoe or a ballet slipper.</p>
        <p>Dr. Andrew Cheng, the project scientist, said the mission already had  successfully solved many mysteries about the asteroid. ''We have seen all of Eros from a variety of orbit distances, taken millions of measurements, and we've answered the biggest questions from when the mission began,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Scientists say Eros is very old, dating back about 4.5 billion years, and probably represents material present when the planets of the solar system formed. Readings indicate Eros is a fractured chip off a larger body, perhaps another asteroid, and has a uniform density about the same as that of the Earth's crust, they said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cheng said a major finding was that Eros was made of material that had scarcely been altered since the beginning of the solar system. The asteroid is an undifferentiated body, he said, that was never subjected to the melting and separation of its materials into distinct layers, as happened with Earth, Mars and other inner planets.</p>
        <p>The asteroid has taken quite a pounding over its long lifetime from other asteroids, comets and other bodies, researchers found. Scientists have counted more than 100,000 craters wider than 50 feet and about one million house-size or bigger boulders scattered across the surface. The asteroid's largest crater is 3.4 miles wide and sits opposite a 6.2-mile-wide saddle-shaped depression.</p>
        <p>Eros appears to be solid rock that, although cracked extensively by impacts from other bodies, is not a collection of small rocks and debris held together by gravity.</p>
        <p>''Some asteroids are like a pile of gravel floating in space, not tightly stuck together,'' Dr. Cheng said, ''Eros is a consolidated body, not a rubble pile.''</p>
        <p>NEAR also revealed several square craters on the surface with right-angled corners that make them look like pieces of breakfast waffles. Scientists said this was probably due to underground cracks and fractures present in the asteroid's solid surface before the impact events that formed the craters. When the impacts occurred, they said, some of the cavities formed followed the straight lines of the underground fractures instead of assuming a traditionally rounded shape.</p>
        <p>Dr. Clark Chapman, an imaging team member from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said Eros' surface was unique in many ways. ''Eros has a very interesting surface, unlike anything we've ever seen on the Moon or on similar types of asteroids observed by spacecraft,'' he said, ''Even the rocks on Eros are larger than those on the Moon.''</p>
        <p>The cratered surface also has steep cliffs and is covered by a deep layer of regolith, loose rocks and dust left over from collisions with other bodies. The spacecraft's laser range-finder instrument, which measures surface height, reveals that this regolith is almost 300 feet deep in some places and has moved over time to smooth over some rough areas and spill into craters.</p>
        <p>Following the low-altitude flyby, engineers moved the spacecraft into a transition orbit to take it safely away from Eros for the time being. NEAR is to move into an orbit 125 miles above the asteroid before making another series of close passes in December.</p>
        <p>''Had we stayed there, the low orbit could have brought the spacecraft dangerously close to the asteroid,'' said Dr. Robert W. Farquhar, the mission director, ''When you make a close pass like that, the gravity field affects the spacecraft a lot more than it would otherwise, so we helped it along with a maneuver.''</p>
        <p>Eros is the smallest object ever orbited by a spacecraft and because of the asteroid's low mass, engineers have to manage the ship's speed carefully to keep it in orbit. In higher orbits 100 to 200 miles above Eros, the spacecraft typically travels at only 2 to 4 miles per hour relative to the asteroid, in order to be held by the body's tenuous gravity. For last week's close pass, NEAR zipped by Eros at about 14 m.p.h., considered blazing speeds for maneuvers around such a light body.</p>
        <p>The NEAR mission is scheduled to end in February, with controllers using the craft's remaining fuel for what they call a ''controlled descent'' to Eros, taking some last close-up readings before crash-landing on the surface.</p>
