        <p>Most American Jews accept marriages between Jews and non-Jews, a national survey by a major Jewish organization has found.</p>
        <p>The results of the survey by the American Jewish Committee contrast with the positions held by most rabbis, Orthodox and non-Orthodox alike, who oppose interfaith marriage as being against Jewish tradition and a threat to the future of a distinct Jewish community.</p>
        <p>The issue has become increasingly important and controversial within many Jewish organizations as the number of such marriages has risen sharply in the last three decades.</p>
        <p>Some estimates suggest that as many as half of the marriages by Jews in recent years have been to non-Jews.</p>
        <p>In the survey, a majority of respondents said they did not oppose interfaith marriage. Forty percent said they were neutral about such unions, and 16 percent said they regarded interfaith marriages as ''a positive good.''</p>
        <p>Twelve percent said they strongly disapproved of interfaith marriages, while 30 percent said they would be disappointed by such marriages if the non-Jewish partner did not convert to Judaism.</p>
        <p>In a further measure of opinions on the issue, 56 percent said they disagreed with the statement, ''It would pain me if my child married a gentile,'' and 80 percent said they agreed that ''intermarriage is inevitable in an open society.''</p>
        <p>Fifty percent said it was racist to oppose marriages between Jews and non-Jews, while 47 percent disagreed.</p>
        <p>Sixty-nine percent said Jews had ''an obligation to urge Jews to marry Jews.'' And in a separate question, asked to choose which posed ''a greater threat to Jewish life,'' 50 percent said anti-Semitism, 41 percent said interfaith marriage.</p>
        <p>The questions were posed in the 2000 Annual Survey of American Jewish Opinion, in which 1,010 Jews were interviewed by telephone in September by Market Facts Inc., a research company in Chicago. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>The committee, a secular organization founded in 1906, undertakes the survey every year, focusing on issues like Jewish political opinions and social opinions and questions about Israel and the Middle East.</p>
        <p>This year, the committee decided to include questions about interfaith marriage, said David Singer, director of research for the committee, which is opposed to interfaith marriage. ''I think in the wake of widespread intermarriage, you see a shift in attitudes,'' Mr. Singer said. ''The taboo is broken. The result is that you see a process of accommodation coming to the fore.''</p>
        <p>Jewish opinion is not uniform on the subject, but shows a sharp division between Orthodox Jews -- the most strictly observant branch of Judaism, whose members are a small minority of the American Jewish population -- and non-Orthodox. For example, 64 percent of Orthodox Jews surveyed said they strongly disapproved of interfaith marriages, as opposed to 15 percent of Conservative Jews, 3 percent of Reform Jews and 2 percent of those who identified themselves as ''just Jewish.''</p>
        <p>Fewer than one in four respondents said a rabbi should refuse to officiate at such marriages, and more than 40 percent said a rabbi should officiate ''even if a gentile clergyman is involved in the ceremony.''</p>
        <p>However, the survey found that Orthodox Jews disagreed with these statements, with 80 percent saying a rabbi should refuse to officiate.</p>
        <p>Egon Mayer, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York's Graduate Center and director of research for the Jewish Outreach Institute, called the survey results ''stunning,'' particularly those about whether rabbis should officiate at interfaith marriages.</p>
        <p>He recalled that in 1990 the institute did a mail survey of 2,179 rabbis, synagogue presidents, Jewish agency officials and Jewish lay people, asking what they would do if they were a rabbi who had been asked to marry an interfaith couple. Sixty-two percent said they would not officiate, Professor Mayer said.</p>
        <p>Asked about the findings of the American Jewish Committee's survey, Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which represents 902 Reform synagogues, said, ''Like it or not, intermarriage is a reality in our society.''</p>
        <p>''We need to stop the hand-wringing,'' Rabbi Yoffie said. ''We have to work very hard to reach out to couples who intermarry.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Kenneth N. Hain, president of the Rabbinical Council of America, which represents about 1,000 Orthodox rabbis, said he was saddened by the survey's findings. But, he said, he believed that there was another trend at work among Jews, involving a greater concern with tradition and Jewish family life. ''I'd hope that all Jews would come to a deeper sense of linkage to their faith,'' Rabbi Hain said. ''If anything, this study challenges me to try to do more to say to all Jews: there are reasons to be Jewish; there are reasons to create Jewish families.''</p>
