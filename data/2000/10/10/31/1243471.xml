        <p>Pamela Frank, violinist, and Peter Serkin, pianist  Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church</p>
        <p>Along with a number of gratifying events during this Bach year (the 250th anniversary of the composer's death), a few have proved genuinely important. The latest was the performance of the six Sonatas for Violin and Keyboard (BWV 1014-19) by Pamela Frank and Peter Serkin on Wednesday evening as part of the Bach 2000 series of the Mannes College of Music.</p>
        <p>Not that this is a particularly prominent area of Bach's output. Except for the Sixth Sonata, expanded and scrambled to make room for an extended keyboard solo, the works predictably follow the four-movement form of the staid old church sonata (slow-fast-slow-fast). And the fast movements are notable more for an effervescent sense of innocent play than as vehicles for bravura display.</p>
        <p>Indeed, although these performances lacked nothing in virtuosity, what made them so valuable was the very extent to which they ennobled a relatively neglected repertory whose charms run too deep to be immediately obvious. The exalted slow movements, especially, came across as arias too intimate, laments too personal for any dramatic stage, played by Ms. Frank with beautiful, flowing lyricism. She seemed slower to embrace the sense of play but did so fully as the evening progressed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Serkin, despite his strong soloistic temperament, has long shown a gift for tricky and delicate collaborations, playing without weight but with enough intensity to make the piano register strongly yet unobtrusively. Even more remarkable, while conveying not merely the notes but also much of the essence of Bach's pinprick writing for harpsichord, Mr. Serkin rivaled Ms. Frank's seamless songfulness at every turn.</p>
        <p>With both players maintaining superb concentration and focus, neither suffered unduly from the churchy acoustics, however overreverberant and saddled with street noise. In a just world, a recording of performances like these would be sure to follow; nowadays, you can only hope.</p>
