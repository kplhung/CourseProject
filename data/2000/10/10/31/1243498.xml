It seems that if obesity were a true genetic disorder, we would see it in other countries to a similar degree, and we do not. Americans simply eat too much and exercise too little. The medicalization of obesity is reminiscent of the very American trait of not taking responsibility for one's behavior.</p>

        <p>I wonder if calling obesity a medical disorder is just another way for the pharmaceutical industry to make a buck, and for the obese to miss out on opportunities to take control of themselves.</p>
