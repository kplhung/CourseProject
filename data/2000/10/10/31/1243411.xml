        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman is in excellent health and has no medical condition that would interfere with his serving as vice president, he and his two doctors said.</p>
        <p>''I feel very healthy'' and ''my energy level is high, my stamina is good,'' Mr. Lieberman said in an interview at a campaign stop here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic running mate, said he could not recall missing a day for health reasons in his 12 years as senator.</p>
        <p>''I am 58, so along the way you pick up aches and pains,'' Mr. Lieberman said. They include a variety of common ailments affecting his skin, eyes, joints and stomach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman regularly takes two drugs to control reflux of stomach acid into his esophagus, a third drug to control two skin conditions, a baby aspirin to help prevent a heart attack, and vitamins.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said he stops three or four times each day to do a daily total of 120 push-ups and 100 sit-ups. Mr. Lieberman ran six days a week until about four years ago, when he cut back to about 30 minutes three times a week because of a knee ailment. He walks or swims on the three other days, he said.</p>
        <p>The knee ailment is chondromalacia patellae, a softening of the cartilage in the kneecap. Knee braces and exercises to strengthen leg muscles have alleviated the pain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said he had not thought about what disclosures he would make if he developed an illness as vice president. ''I presume that I have an obligation to disclose any illness certainly that might affect my ability to carry out my responsibilities,'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman and, earlier, Vice President Al Gore, spoke about their health as part of a series of articles in The New York Times in which candidates for president and other high political offices and, with the candidates' permission, their doctors have been interviewed about their medical conditions. An aide to Mr. Lieberman stopped the interview, in which he gave the first disclosures about his health, after about 15 minutes, saying the senator had to leave for the airport with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, has allowed one of his doctors to be interviewed. But the governor has so far declined to be interviewed. His running mate, Dick Cheney, has released doctors' letters summarizing his health but has not responded to requests for interviews with him and his doctors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said his regular doctors are Dr. Mark L. Schwartz, a longtime friend and internist in New Haven, and Dr. John F. Eisold, the attending physician to Congress.</p>
        <p>Dr. Eisold has performed Mr. Lieberman's recent annual checkups. He declined, as a matter of policy, to be interviewed and instead issued a summary of Mr. Lieberman's medical history.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schwartz said in a lengthy interview that his care of Mr. Lieberman is now limited to examining his colon every three years. Mr. Lieberman has had several noncancerous growths removed, and his father died of colon cancer. He is due for another examination next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said his most disconcerting medical problem was an inflamed esophagus from gastro-esophageal reflux. The first episode occurred about 10 years ago when he woke up with chest pain. Concerned that he might be having a heart attack, Mr. Lieberman called his neighbor, Dr. Schwartz. A cardiac examination, including a stress test, found no evidence of heart disease, Dr. Schwartz said.</p>
        <p>Last February, while at meetings in Europe, Mr. Lieberman said he had ''a real rough night, and it was sort of a turning point'' because the episodes became more constant.</p>
        <p>After undergoing more tests in early March, Mr. Lieberman began taking two drugs -- Prilosec in the morning and Zantac before going to bed. In a standard step, he also raised the head of his bed to prevent acid reflux during the night.</p>
        <p>Because the episodes have  stopped, Mr. Lieberman said that he hopes to stop the drugs, but that on Dr. Eisold's advice he is postponing that step until after the election.</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Schwartz said that Dr. Eisold sends him reports about Mr. Lieberman's care, Dr. Schwartz said he was surprised to learn of two new diagnoses from Dr. Eisold's latest summary: the knee ailment and an eye condition.</p>
        <p>The eye condition is not serious, is common as people age, did not require treatment and is known as a posterior vitreous detachment. Describing his temporary symptoms, Mr. Lieberman said: ''I suddenly began to see this floater -- it was like a hair -- and then a flasher at night.''  The hair represents tiny clumps of cells in the vitreous gel that makes up the bulk of the eye.</p>
        <p>When patients suddenly see floaters, ophthalmologists usually check for a tear or hole in the retina that could lead to permanent damage. He had none, Mr. Lieberman and his doctors said. The vitreous detachment is not the same as a retinal detachment, which is more serious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has mild arthritis in his neck. He takes a small dose of a drug, Atarax, to help control two skin conditions, urticaria (a form of hives) and eczema. Because urticaria, arthritis and joint problems can be linked to a systemic disorder, lupus, he underwent extensive testing that showed he did not have lupus, the doctors said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is 5 feet 9 1/2 inches tall, weighs 170 pounds and generally keeps to a kosher diet, avoiding meat but eating fish when away from home. ''That means I eat more fish probably than most people, which is probably good for me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's blood tests at his last checkup in March were reported as normal, the doctors said. His total cholesterol (188) and other lipids H.D.L. (high density lipoprotein, or good cholesterol -- 46), his L.D.L. (low-density lipoprotein, or bad cholesterol -- 123), and triglycerides (96) are normal. The prostate specific antigen test for prostate cancer was a normal 0.82. His blood pressure was 112/72.</p>
        <p>When his first marriage reached a crisis point, Mr. Lieberman said that he and his wife went into couples therapy. ''Unfortunately, it did not work to save the marriage, but it did work to ease the separation and divorce,'' he said. ''Other than that I have not been in therapy.''</p>
        <p>In addition to exercise, Mr. Lieberman said that he relieved stress by praying three times a day, observing the Sabbath, singing and enjoying  recreational activities with his family. When he is short on sleep, he said he catnaps and relies on ''the adrenaline surge that the crowds give you,'' and added that ''Warm and encouraging reactions from the American people go a long way in keeping you going on less sleep.''</p>
