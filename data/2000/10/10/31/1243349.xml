        <p>A long-elusive protein that could have a serious impact in medicine has recently come to light because of the availability of the human genome sequence.</p>
        <p>The protein stimulates the cells of the immune system to grow and divide and to churn out antibodies. The existence of such an agent has long been surmised, but until now it has escaped detection.</p>
        <p>The importance of its role in the body and of its target, the antibody-producing cells known as B cells, means the protein is being considered as the basis for treating three separate groups of diseases: the autoimmune disease known as lupus, certain immune-deficiency diseases, and B cell lymphomas, an important group of cancers.</p>
        <p>At least six separate groups of researchers independently discovered the protein, which was a missing member of a well-known family of cell-stimulating factors, or cytokines, known as the TNF family. By searching genome databases for genes with a pattern of DNA letters similar to those of known TNF family members, the researchers fished out the new gene. Five of these reports were published in 1999 and a sixth this year.</p>
        <p>Just as victory has many fathers, the new protein is blessed with six  different names, a handicap that it will bear until some scientific nomenclature committee comes to its rescue. These include jargon based acronyms such as TALL-1, THANK and BAFF and the label zTNF4. Perhaps the least awkward is BLyS, for B lymphocyte stimulator. B lymphocyte is the B cell's proper name.</p>
        <p>Several companies have plans for treatments based on the B cell stimulator protein. ZymoGenetics, a biotechnology company in Seattle, showed in April that it could improve a lupuslike disease in mice with an anti-BLyS treatment. Lupus erythematosus, the principal kind, is an autoimmune disease in which the B cells produce copious antibodies, some of which attack the body's own tissues.</p>
        <p>Figuring that an excess of BLyS might be the force that was driving the B cells, Dr. Jane Gross of ZymoGenetics and other researchers injected the mice with another protein that mops up the stimulator, and showed that the lupus-like symptoms of the mice improved.</p>
        <p>A company that is taking the B cell stimulator protein in at least three directions is Human Genome Sciences of Rockville, Md. Though it was one of the last to publish its discovery, the company says it was the first to file patent applications, which cover the use of BLyS in the three diseases and as an enhancer of vaccines.</p>
        <p>Yesterday two groups of researchers working with the company reported at a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology in Philadelphia that levels of BLyS are generally elevated in patients with lupus. It was the first time that BLyS has been implicated in the human version of the disease.</p>
        <p>''These data speak strongly to BLyS being being part of the chain of causality in lupus,'' said Dr. Robert P. Kimberly of the University of Alabama, an author of one of the studies.</p>
        <p>If BLyS is to blame for lupus patients' errant B cells, an obvious treatment strategy is to bank down the levels of BLyS in the bloodstream.</p>
        <p>The ZymoGenetics approach is to make copies of one of the receptor proteins that stud the surface of B cells and to which BLyS binds. These decoy receptors have a high affinity for BLyS, and when injected in soluble form into the bloodstream they divert BLyS from the receptors attached to B cells.</p>
        <p>Human Genome Sciences has hired the Cambridge Antibody Technology Group of Cambridge, England, to make an antibody to BLyS. By linking the human antibody-making genes to bacterial viruses, Cambridge Antibody Technology can generate the same variety of antibodies on the surface of bacteria that the human produces in response to a foreign protein. An antibody tailored to have an affinity for BLyS can then be selected from the artificially made library.</p>
        <p>Dr. William Haseltine, the chief executive of Human Genome Sciences, said it would take nine months to start manufacturing an anti-BLyS antibody to federal standards. The company will then start a clinical test of the antibody in lupus patients.</p>
        <p>The new finding that BLyS is elevated in people with lupus is ''a nice advance,'' said Dr. Carl F. Ware, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology in San Diego.</p>
        <p>He said the decoy receptor method has been proved to work, in the case of two drugs that act as a decoy for the protein that causes inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, but that it remained to be seen how well the anti-BLyS antibody would work in lupus patients.</p>
        <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum from the lupus patients who make too much BLyS are those who for a variety of reasons make too little. BLyS itself could be a useful treatment for a group of disorders known as common variable immunodeficiency. A clinical trial to test the safety of BLyS is about to start.</p>
        <p>A third possible use for BLyS is in treating a group of cancers that develop from B cells at various stages of their development. These cancers, known as B cell lymphomas, retain many B cell properties including, in at least some cases, that of displaying the usual BLyS receptors on their surface. When the BLyS protein hits the receptor of any B cell, the cell draws both BLyS and the occupied receptor into itself, recycling the receptor's components and degrading the BLyS.</p>
        <p>This behavior, and that fact that only mature B cells display the BLyS receptors, may provide the opportunity to kill B cell lymphomas selectively, Dr. Haseltine said. His company is preparing BLyS molecules that are linked to a radioactive chemical. Unlike most chemotherapy agents, which kill cells unselectively, the radioactive BLyS would home in on the cancerous B cell and the mature B cells, he said; the patient's immune system would be reconstituted from the younger B cells.</p>
        <p>Clinical trials of radioactive BLyS could begin at the end of next year, said Dr. Craig A. Rosen, the company's research director.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bart Barlogie, an expert on myeloma at the University of Arkansas and a consultant to Human Genome Sciences, said the idea of radioactive BLyS was ''a very rational approach and technically feasible, and I look forward to seeing it evaluated.''</p>
