        <p>After much agonizing, the Nets waived Elliot Perry yesterday. The ninth-year backup point guard has a $2.8 million guaranteed salary this year. Perry came to the Nets as part of the Stephon Marbury trade in March 1999.</p>
        <p>''I've always landed on my feet, but it's a better cushion when you have a contract,'' said Perry, who averaged 5.3 points and 2.3 assists in 60 games last season but was hindered by a hip flexor in training camp.</p>

        <p>After much agonizing, the Nets waived Elliot Perry yesterday. The ninth-year backup point guard has a $2.8 million guaranteed salary this year. Perry came to the Nets as part of the Stephon Marbury trade in March 1999.</p>
        <p>''I've always landed on my feet, but it's a better cushion when you have a contract,'' said Perry, who averaged 5.3 points and 2.3 assists in 60 games last season but was hindered by a hip flexor in training camp.</p>
        <p>The Nets also waived Kevin Freeman, the rookie free-agent shooting guard from the University of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Kevin Ollie, a free-agent backup point guard, secured the final spot on the 12-man active roster.</p>
        <p>Ollie signed a $548,500 nonguaranteed contract the second day of training camp after Lucious Harris was set for hernia surgery.</p>
        <p>Last season, Ollie was the backup point guard for the Philadelphia 76ers and played in 10 playoff games.</p>
        <p>The Nets think Harris could return sooner than expected, perhaps missing only three games.</p>
