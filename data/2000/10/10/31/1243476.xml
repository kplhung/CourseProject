        <p>The rich traditions of Bulgarian folk music and dance came alive with great charm and verve in a performance by Bulgari on Friday night at Symphony Space. Founded in 1993, Bulgari is made up of artists who have performed with the Bulgarian National Folk Ensemble and National Radio Orchestra, two leading companies in Bulgaria.</p>
        <p>The performers made clear the quick, odd rhythmic shifts in seamless skeins of dance and music. And the 19 songs, instrumental numbers and dance presented by the troupe bore evidence of many cultural influences.</p>
        <p>The eight dances on the program, drawn from village traditions and arranged for the stage, were fascinating in their suggestion of age-old customs. There were two distinct duos, one male and the other female, with male and female dancers seldom joining forces. In each pair, arms were generally linked and hands fastened firmly on the other dancer's belt.</p>
        <p>The most energetic, complex moves and footwork went to the men. Fast smooth sideways travel and quick-changing rhythms predominated for all four dancers (Stanislav Ivanov, Rossitza Ivanova, Velko Jovkov and Krassimira Anatassova).</p>
        <p>The troupe was led by Georgi Doichev, who performed on the gaida or bagpipe and introduced the numbers with helpful information about the regions they came from. The musicians also included Georgi Andreev on the gadulka (a form of fiddle), Georgi Zaliazkov on the kaval (flute), Anton Tzamov on the tambura (lute) and Ivaylo Koutchev on the tupan (drum). The haunting songs were performed by Petrana Koutcheva, Radostina Kuneva and Neli Andreeva, a singer with a luminous face straight out of a Merchant-Ivory film.</p>
        <p>Bulgari was presented by the World Music Institute.</p>
