        <p>There are plenty of traits to like about the Washington Redskins. They can run the ball, throw it, play defense and exhibit rich resolve. But there is more to love about the Tennessee Titans, and Tennessee showed everyone -- including the Redskins -- that here Monday night.</p>
        <p>In a game packed with big plays, points, twisted plots, comebacks and, most of all, sheer fun, Tennessee was the team left standing early this morning, a 27-21 winner over the Redskins before 83,472 fans at FedEx Field. Both teams entered with winning streaks, but Tennessee (7-1) left with one that has grown to seven games and Washington (6-3) saw its streak end at five.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of traits to like about the Washington Redskins. They can run the ball, throw it, play defense and exhibit rich resolve. But there is more to love about the Tennessee Titans, and Tennessee showed everyone -- including the Redskins -- that here Monday night.</p>
        <p>In a game packed with big plays, points, twisted plots, comebacks and, most of all, sheer fun, Tennessee was the team left standing early this morning, a 27-21 winner over the Redskins before 83,472 fans at FedEx Field. Both teams entered with winning streaks, but Tennessee (7-1) left with one that has grown to seven games and Washington (6-3) saw its streak end at five.</p>
        <p>The Titans were sparked by two second-quarter returns for touchdowns -- a 69-yard punt return by Derrick Mason and an 81-yard interception return by Samari Rolle -- which gave them a 20-7 halftime lead. Those scores turned the game decidedly in Tennessee's favor. But the winning points were actually scored on an 18-yard touchdown pass from Steve McNair to Frank Wycheck with 10 minutes 12 seconds left in the game.</p>
        <p>That score was sandwiched by two Washington touchdowns: a Stephen Davis 1-yard run in the final seconds of the third quarter that cut the Tennessee lead to 20-14 and a Brad Johnson to Larry Centers scoring pass of 3 yards with 6:42 left that ended the game's scoring.</p>
        <p>All night long, Tennessee kept producing the biggest plays that counted the most.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 27-21 with 2:15 left, Washington had the ball at its 20 and was poised for a final push, a dramatic winning drive. But Rolle promptly ended that threat only 16 seconds later with his second interception of Johnson in the game, this one at the Washington 31.</p>
        <p>It was a fast-paced and active game, one fans might like to see again. It could happen; both teams have showed they are of Super Bowl-caliber and both were among early preseason picks to get there.</p>
        <p>If that happens, based on this game, it is Washington that will have a score to settle.</p>
        <p>Tennessee showed that it gained a great deal from its Super Bowl experience last year, absorbing Washington's best early offensive shot, which put the Titans behind by 7-0. It was Tennessee, though, that scored the half's final points en route to a 20-7 lead. And all 20 points were scored in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>The last play, and the play of the half, shook the Redskins. A Johnson pass was intercepted, apparently halting a Washington drive. Tennessee, however, was called for holding in the secondary, giving Johnson another chance with 10 seconds remaining and the ball at the Titan 34.</p>
        <p>But Johnson's next pass was intercepted as well. And this one counted.</p>
        <p>Johnson's pass near the Tennessee 19 was intended for receiver Albert Connell. But Rolle used his quick closing speed and wiry, long arms to grab the ball by leaping in front of Connell. Rolle then weaved downfield for a hair-raising 81-yard touchdown. It was simply marvelous for Tennessee and backbreaking for Washington.</p>
        <p>Rolle's return for a score was the second for the Titans: Mason had grabbed a punt and brought it back 69 yards for a touchdown for a 10-7 lead four minutes into the second quarter. Only two minutes earlier, Al Del Greco's 46-yard field goal gave Tennessee its first points.</p>
        <p>Washington had no second-quarter answers for Tennessee's resilient play, but the way the Redskins worked on their initial drive hinted that it was the Titans who would be playing catch-up all night.</p>
        <p>On its first drive, Washington dissected the Tennessee defense. The Titans entered having allowed no points on any opening drive this season -- the only team to have accomplished that. But Washington, which scripts its first 15 to 20 offensive plays, ripped Tennessee's defense with an array of runs and passes.  The Redskins' 18-play, 84-yard drive took 8:19.</p>
        <p>The drive was fueled by a third-and-13 catch of 20 yards by Connell to the Washington 45. Then Johnson scrambled for 13 yards and took a wicked blow at the end of the run by cornerback Denard Walker. Tennessee helped Washington with a pass-interference penalty (on Rolle), which gave the Redskins' drive life on a third-and-5 after an incomplete pass by Johnson. Two plays later, Johnson tossed a flare pass to the left to back Mike Sellars, who scored from 5 yards out and rolled over Rolle at the end of the play.</p>
        <p>But Rolle responded in a big way.</p>
        <p>As did all of the Titans.</p>
