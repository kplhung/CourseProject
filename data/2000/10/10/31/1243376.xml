        <p>Sitting at a computer crowned with a soft toy shaped like the Eiffel Tower, Olivier Barre spends the day counseling French customers, in their own language, on high-ticket purchases of I.B.M.'s wares to be delivered in France.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, after bidding his last client a breezy au revoir, he drives home through the bustling streets of Dublin.</p>
        <p>Dublin?</p>
        <p>Indeed. For just as the global telecommunications revolution has long outpaced political borders, so, too, has big business started to dissolve the frontiers associated with language. And as Dublin has turned from economic byway to boom-town highway, companies ranging from I.B.M. to Lufthansa to Compaq Computer have been drawn here by low corporate taxes, relatively low wages, skilled English-speaking labor and government help in financing and building the call centers that have become a fount of thousands of jobs for the Irish and foreigners alike.</p>
        <p>These companies have discovered, too, that it is cheaper and more efficient to group all their European call-center operations -- for sales, marketing or help lines -- together under one, relatively low-cost multilingual roof.</p>
        <p>So companies have hired more than 3,000 Europeans who have migrated here to work in a land once known primarily for sending its sons and daughters over the seas in search of work. And the travels of people like Mr. Barre not only mirror a huge reverse migration of the Irish, returning to feast on economic good times, they are also part of a new generation of Europeans breaking the mold of language barriers and stay-at-home work forces.</p>
        <p>All around Mr. Barre's workstation at I.B.M.'s 1,200-employee call center, other telesales agents, as they are called, fly their national flags over their desks and do the same job in a medley of European tongues -- French or Danish or German, including the Austrian and Swiss varieties. All are dealing with clients who have been switched through automatically after dialing a toll-free number in Paris or Berlin, Oslo or Zurich.</p>
        <p>''At school we learned about going abroad to get experience and prove that we are able to move from one place to another,'' Mr. Barre, 30, said. ''My generation and the next generation are much more willing to do that kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, many new migrants, some here only temporarily, make Mr. Barre seem like an an old-timer. Their average age is 23 or 24, with pretax earnings of around $15,000, said Jason Kennedy, of the Marlborough Group, Ireland's biggest private recruiting agency, which has tapped into a gold mine of luring the Irish back home and seeking out young Europeans. Since the company went public three years ago, its stock price has almost doubled. Some students are even recruited from European universities to take a year working in Ireland as part of an English-language course.</p>
        <p>''As long as Europe keeps providing students,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''we'll keep trying to attract them.''</p>
        <p>More significant from Ireland's standpoint, people like Mr. Barre and his colleague Marion Belondrade, 28 -- both recruited directly from I.B.M. operations in France -- have also helped fuel Ireland's boom, known as the Celtic Tiger. The economy has grown by up to 9 percent annually for six years, more than three times the European Union average; unemployment has plunged to 3.8 percent, Europe's lowest, from 16 percent in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>Over the last 10 years, the boom has expanded the number of people working in this nation of 3.7 million to 1.7 million from around one million. It is a young country -- 40 percent of the population is under 25, and the average age is only 31, according to Ireland's Industrial Development Agency, a government body set up to attract foreign investors.</p>
        <p>And many new workers are women who would once have stayed home.</p>
        <p>But low unemployment also means shortages of skilled workers in key jobs. Such is the nature of Ireland's economy, driven by service and high technology and with virtually full employment, that, above all, it is up to people like Mr. Barre, whose youth and skills are in high demand, to keep pushing the boom forward.</p>
        <p>''The bull case is that we are going to continue to grow as long as we continue to attract labor,'' and as long as increases in productivity offset inflation, said Dan McClaughlin, chief economist with ABN-Amro here. ''If we are a dynamic region of the euro economy, why can't we grow for years to come?'' Ireland has thus become a kind of high-octane testing ground within the zone of Europe's single currency, its economy fueled by largely American investment, driven largely by young Irish and European Union immigrants.</p>
        <p>Walk down Grafton Street, Dublin's main pedestrian thoroughfare, and the boutiques, cafes and stores teem with people in their late teens and 20's. ''This is really an international city,'' Ms. Belondrade said, and the social life is ''absolutely'' good.</p>
        <p>And, Mr. Barre said, ''it was part of the adventure'' to return to Ireland, where he had studied in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Yet as this polyglot society spills over from the call centers to the thriving bars and night spots of Dublin's Temple Bar neighborhood, the horizon has begun to gather a few clouds. Since January 1999, when Ireland became the only English-speaking country to adopt the euro, inflation has soared from 1.9 percent to 6.2 percent -- three times the European average -- pushing up a lot more than the price of a pint of Guinness. And that has confronted Irish authorities with one of the euro-zone's central quandaries: how does any individual country manage the economy without control of interest rates, which are now set by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt?</p>
        <p>A year before Ireland adopted the euro, its benchmark interest rate stood at 6.19 percent, according to the Bank of Ireland, the nation's central bank. Euro membership automatically pushed interest rates down to 3 percent, and even though the euro benchmark is now 4.75 percent, the combination of low interest rates and huge demand from returning expatriates and the newly wealthy has sent house prices soaring by some 20 percent a year, pricing many out of the market.</p>
        <p>Moreover, with 80 percent of its imports from outside the euro zone -- mainly Britain and the United States -- the euro's sharp fall against the dollar and the pound has propelled overall inflation still higher, Mr. McClaughlin said.</p>
        <p>That has left many salaried people, like nurses, police officers and teachers, sensing that their wages are not keeping pace in what is becoming a two-track society.</p>
        <p>''There's a growing disparity between those who are doing well and those who are not doing well,'' said Conor Brady, editor of The Irish Times. ''There is a widespread feeling on the part of people in more traditional employment that they have been left behind by the whole economic miracle.''</p>
        <p>The division is evident enough. Prosperity has brought traffic snarls that fray tempers in this once easygoing society, the cost of housing is as much a topic of dismayed conversation as it is in Manhattan or London, restaurant reservations are hard to come by, and finding a cab is virtually impossible most days.</p>
        <p>''Things in this society in many ways have never been as good,'' Mr. Brady said, ''but equally, in certain ways, things have never really irritated people as much.''</p>
        <p>For all the underlying tension, though, few people want to return to the old ways. Yet Ireland's future is not entirely in its own hands. The perennial curse of foreign investment is that it can be withdrawn: those same people drawn to Ireland by its low cost and easy taxes could well rethink their investments if the Celtic Tiger turns into a pussycat. This is particularly true with American technology companies plagued by falling earnings and seesawing stock prices.</p>
        <p>While I.B.M. made its investment here for the long haul, said Douglas L. Maine, general manager of ibm .com, ''if Ireland becomes cost prohibitive, that would be a consideration about future expansion.''</p>
        <p>Many American mainstays in the Irish economy -- like Dell Computer -- are watching their stocks plummet back home.</p>
        <p>Irish officials seem well aware of the perils. ''We live or die by internationally traded goods and services,'' said Jim Whelan, of the Industrial Development Agency. ''If we don't offer a competitive environment to produce the goods and services the world needs, we are dead in the water.''</p>
        <p>And there is a keen awareness of the critical nature of American investment. European development aid provided ''a huge uplift,'' Mr. Brady said, ''but the real rocket thrust of the economy here is the big American information technology companies.''</p>
        <p>Ireland's boom is rooted in a series of shrewd government calls to invest in higher education, spend some $5 billion to leapfrog from telecommunications backwater to digital front-runner and lure outside investment with corporate taxes as low as 10 percent. That brought in big American technology companies, and call centers have followed, driven by a logic of their own.</p>
        <p>''In running a call center effectively and efficiently, you need to have 200 people or so,'' Mr. Maine of I.B.M. said. ''In Europe, language is always an issue, so the trade-off is between wanting to have an efficient operation of a certain size versus doing it in a particular country where the language skills are present.''</p>
        <p>With huge competition luring call-center investment elsewhere -- like Northern Ireland or depressed parts of mainland Britain -- Ireland made business sense, he said. ''I.B.M. had a physical presence, and the government has been very good in terms of training,'' Mr. Maine said.</p>
        <p>''There were tax reasons, but also Ireland had a relatively low cost of living and was seen to be a desirable place to live by our representatives,'' he added. ''They like it here.''</p>
        <p>So why not some other low-cost place, like Wales?</p>
        <p>Dublin, said David A. Cornick, director of the I.B.M. call center here, ''is at the moment a hot spot'' for young people. ''Wales doesn't have quite the same buzz.''</p>
