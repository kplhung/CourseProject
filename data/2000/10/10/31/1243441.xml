        <p>A bill that would greatly tighten the lid of secrecy on government information has been sent to President Clinton, and administration officials said today that there was sharp division over whether he should sign or veto it.</p>
        <p>The provision, a few paragraphs in a multipage spending bill that finances the intelligence agencies, would subject a government official convicted of disclosing any classified information to three years in prison.</p>
        <p>The ''antileak'' legislation was requested by the Central Intelligence Agency, which said it has lost agents and sophisticated surveillance methods because of newspaper articles based on leaks of classified information, and was drafted with help from the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials said today that the bill was narrowly drafted and was needed to fill gaps in disclosure laws. But many journalists and First Amendment lawyers oppose the bill and even some of its supporters said the legislation was overly broad.</p>
        <p>Though White House officials signed off on the legislation initially, criticism of it after it passed began to give more administration officials pause. There is now strong opposition to the bill inside and outside the White House, an administration official said. The president has until Nov. 4 to act on the bill.</p>
        <p>Representative Porter J. Goss, Republican of Florida and chairman of the House intelligence committee, said leaks of classified information were ''not just a trickle, they've become a waterfall'' and had caused serious damage to the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goss, a former central intelligence officer, said he would have preferred more carefully drafted legislation to deal with leaks but thought this provision was better than nothing.</p>
        <p>The law should have been limited to ''the most egregious cases, where there is serious damage to national security,'' Mr. Goss said, and it should be clear that it does not apply to ''dinner table slips.''</p>
        <p>The antileak measure was inserted into the Intelligence Authorization Act by the Senate Intelligence Committee after closed hearings. It was  adopted without public hearings, with testimony from intelligence agency officials. The House Intelligence Committee also approved the spending measure with the antileak provision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goss said that the House and Senate committees had been troubled by instances in which newspapers had published information that came from sophisticated electronic surveillance, and that these had exposed methods and sources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goss said he could not provide details about those cases because in doing so he would be disclosing classified information -- in violation of the legislation.</p>
        <p>He said that in spite of his reservations about aspects of the bill, he would urge the president to sign it, and that his committee would hold hearings next year, with a view toward fixing the bill if necessary.</p>
        <p>The measure called for criminal penalties for anyone who ''knowingly and willfully discloses, or attempts to disclose, any classified information acquired as a result of such person's authorized access to classified information to a person who is not authorized access to such classified information, knowing that the person is not authorized access to such classified information.''</p>
        <p>Some Pentagon and White House officials agreed that the language is too sweeping, a view shared by many in Congress, conservatives and liberals, as well as by news media, which said the bill will impede the flow of information to the public.</p>
        <p>''It's potentially disastrous for a government spokesman,'' Kenneth H. Bacon, assistant secretary of defense for public information, said today. ''It's disastrous for journalists. It's disastrous for any official who deals with the press in national security, whether at State, the N.S.C., or the Pentagon.''</p>
        <p>In answering even a simple question, a spokesman runs the risk of violating the law because he will be relying on information that has been given to him, some of it classified, Mr. Bacon said.</p>
        <p>As an example, he cited being asked about the movement of Iraqi troops, a frequent question. To answer it, he said, he must necessarily rely on classified information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon has made his concerns known to the White House, where many officials agree with him.</p>
        <p>Representatives from The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN have urged the White House to veto the bill. The American Society of Newspaper Editors is planning to send a letter to the White House urging President Clinton to veto the bill, and the Newspaper Association of America, a publishers' trade group, is urging its members to contact the White House.</p>
        <p>In Congress, conservatives and liberals have expressed concern about the bill.</p>
        <p>Last week, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois and one of the more conservative members of Congress, and Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, and one of the more liberal members, wrote the chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee, Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, asking that he include a provision in one of his committee's  bills to delay the effective date of the antileak measure for one year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goss said he had no objection to such a delay, but he was worried that in the year there would be an avalanche of secrets disclosed.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Rogers, Daniel DuBray, said today that the request from Mr. Hyde and Mr. Conyers was pending.</p>
        <p>Laura Handman, a First Amendment lawyer in Washington, said several things about the law concerned her. The law punishes the government official who leaks the information and not the media outlet that publishes it, but Ms. Handman said that journalists would face more subpoenas as prosecutors sought to identify the leakers.</p>
        <p>More troubling, she said, the law ''broadens the scope of what would be punishable and, given the casual manner that things are classified, that's a very broad scope.''</p>
        <p>Current law makes it a crime to disclose classified information if it aids a foreign government, exposes intelligence agents or relates to the national defense. ''The government has a compelling interest in protecting confidentiality in those cases,'' Ms. Handman said.</p>
        <p>The new law goes beyond those categories, she said: ''It opens the floodgates.''</p>
        <p>Just how broad the new legislation is remains a matter of disagreement, with some lawyers saying it now covers virtually all classified information, and the Justice Department countering that it still only includes information the disclosure of which harms the national security.</p>
        <p>But it is precisely this ambiguity that critics of the bill said would have a chilling effect.</p>
        <p>The 13 federal agencies that operate under the national security classification system include the intelligence agencies -- C.I.A., Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency -- as well as the Departments of Energy, State and Treasury, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goss and Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Senate committee on intelligence, cited its support by the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>''Do the people in Justice, do they understand that there are no rules about classification?'' asked Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who has been a leading voice against overclassification by government agencies.</p>
        <p>''Do you know what it takes to classify something 'Top Secret'?'' he continued. ''You go down to the stationary store and buy a stamp that says 'Top Secret.' ''</p>
        <p>The military services eager to gain public support for their programs are also likely to find the law troubling. Reporters are routinely taken on Navy ships, for example, but told that certain things they see are classified and that they cannot report what they see. A reporter might honor the restriction, but the officers who allows him to see the classified information could be in violation of the law.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 3, 2000, Friday  An article on Tuesday about President Clinton's veto of a spending bill that finances the Treasury Department and White House and Congressional operations referred imprecisely in some copies to negotiations with Republicans in Congress. Republicans say he promised to sign the bill, but White House aides say he did not. He never publicly promised to sign it.</p>
