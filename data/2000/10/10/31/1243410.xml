        <p>Just when horse racing was building to its most important event of the year, the Breeders' Cup next Saturday, 22 tracks threatened to withdraw from the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, which was established three years ago to unify the business.</p>
        <p>The rebellious tracks include Garden State Park, the Meadowlands Racetrack and Monmouth Park in New Jersey, Pimlico and Laurel in Maryland,  Santa Anita in California and Gulfstream Park in Florida, plus six other tracks recently bought by Frank Stronach of Canada, who has become the most powerful force in racing.</p>

        <p>Just when horse racing was building to its most important event of the year, the Breeders' Cup next Saturday, 22 tracks threatened to withdraw from the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, which was established three years ago to unify the business.</p>
        <p>The rebellious tracks include Garden State Park, the Meadowlands Racetrack and Monmouth Park in New Jersey, Pimlico and Laurel in Maryland,  Santa Anita in California and Gulfstream Park in Florida, plus six other tracks recently bought by Frank Stronach of Canada, who has become the most powerful force in racing.</p>
        <p>They threatened to defect because the association's Television Games Network, a wagering system, posed a conflict to some of their own television betting systems. The tracks also believe the N.T.R.A. had overreached in building an expensive business empire and not just marketing the sport, as originally planned.</p>
        <p>Chip Tuttle, senior vice president at the N.T.R.A., said today that the tracks have indicated that the decision is negotiable, and that the two sides would meet next week at Churchill Downs.</p>
        <p>The 22 tracks, constituting almost one-fourth of the association's 79 members, said they would withdraw their membership on Nov. 10, the deadline for renewals. But aides to Tim Smith, commissioner of the N.T.R.A., said they would still be considered members until Dec. 31. The future of the Breeders' Cup would be affected by mass withdrawals since two of the tracks, Santa Anita and Gulfstream, former hosts for the Cup races, would not be eligible to serve as hosts in the future.</p>
        <p>''This is a week when the competition should be the focus,'' Tuttle said, ''not the politics of the industry.''</p>
