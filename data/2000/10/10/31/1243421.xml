        <p>The News Corporation, which had planned to sell part of its global satellite businesses to the public next month, has postponed the sale because of market conditions, a person close to the company said yesterday.</p>
        <p>News Corporation had planned to spin off a stake in Sky Global Networks, which contains the company's satellite businesses in places including Britain and Asia.

        <p>The News Corporation, which had planned to sell part of its global satellite businesses to the public next month, has postponed the sale because of market conditions, a person close to the company said yesterday.</p>
        <p>News Corporation had planned to spin off a stake in Sky Global Networks, which contains the company's satellite businesses in places including Britain and Asia. Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corporation, is interested in using Sky Global to acquire DirecTV, the satellite business owned by the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors, people close to the matter have said.</p>
        <p>Despite its decision to postpone the offering, News Corporation is talking with the Microsoft Corporation about selling a nearly $1 billion stake in Sky Global, which would give Microsoft 3.5 percent of the company, a person close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Such an investment would act as a further endorsement of the value of Mr. Murdoch's spinoff. Liberty Media Group, a company that holds stakes in various media companies and is controlled by John C. Malone, has already agreed to a complex deal in which Liberty would increase its stake in News Corporation, which would receive Liberty's Gemstar-TV Guide holdings in return.</p>
        <p>Under that arrangement, Liberty would receive part of its compensation in News Corporation stock and the rest in Sky Global shares once that company was spun off. That deal put a value of about $38 billion on Sky Global. The deal with Microsoft values Sky Global at about $30 billion, partly because technology stocks have slumped recently.</p>
        <p>The developments concerning Sky Global were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time that News Corporation has considered spinning off part of its operations. It spun off a stake in Fox Film Entertainment two years ago, though that offering has met with lukewarm reception on Wall Street, partly because of the volatility of the film business.</p>
        <p>This would not be the first time Microsoft invested in related technologies. It bought a stake in the Comcast Corporation, a cable company based in Philadelphia, several years ago. News Corporation hopes the spinoff will help it make further acquisitions and deliver wireless broadband Internet services.</p>
