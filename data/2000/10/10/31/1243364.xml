        <p>Just more than a year ago, British Telecommunications was under fire for, of all things, having too little debt. Analysts urged the former state-run monopoly to borrow money and make acquisitions to keep pace with its competitors. So it bought minority stakes in two mobile phone operators, SmarTone Telecommunications in Hong Kong and LG Telecom in South Korea. It also invested in Cegetel, the French telecommunications group, and in Airtel Movil of Spain.</p>
        <p>In a sign of how drastically times have changed for telecommunications companies, analysts are now insisting that British Telecommunications sell many of those assets to reduce its debt, which is expected to triple, to $:30 billion ($43 billion), by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>''There is the possibility of asset disposals to reduce debt, but nothing has been set yet,'' said John Salmon, a spokesman for British Telecommunications.</p>
        <p>British Telecommunications is not alone in its strategic about-face. Royal KPN, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and almost every other big player are also scaling back their ambitions in the face of soaring costs for so-called third-generation mobile phone licenses, which will be used to offer high-speed data communications that are eventually expected to galvanize electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>''The previous strategy of being big is no longer viable,'' said Mark Lambert, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''These companies will need to compromise their strategies -- and we're talking major limitations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lambert said he expected the current bout of strategic belt-tightening to intensify in the next six to nine months. ''What we've seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Such strategic backpedaling is one reason European telecommunications stocks are unlikely to regain their former lofty levels soon, analysts say. An index of these stocks tracked by Datastream, a unit of Thomson Financial, is off 47 percent from its 12-month high in March, and analysts hold out the possibility that the $770 billion in market value eliminated in that slide could be gone for good.</p>
        <p>''The whole equation has changed because the numbers have changed,'' Mr. Lambert said.</p>
        <p>Before the European auctions for third-generation licenses -- which could total $130 billion -- the ratio of capital expenditure to sales for major telecommunications companies averaged 15 percent and was declining, Mr. Lambert said. Factoring in the long-term cost of these licenses, which Mr. Lambert amortized over 10 years, the ratio jumps to 20 percent. That increase, which measures the rising cost of doing business, should translate into a permanent 35 percent reduction in the market value of these companies, Mr. Lambert argued.</p>
        <p>While European telecommunications stocks have fallen even more than that, he said, they also started from an inflated level. He said the current value was about fair.</p>
        <p>''But don't expect these stocks to bounce 20 percent,'' he warned.</p>
        <p>Even as investors digest the increased costs of financing new services like mobile commerce, it remains unclear whether these companies will be able to finance the strategies they have paid for so dearly. The amount of money telecommunications companies are trying to raise over the next few months is unparalleled.</p>
        <p>In the fourth quarter alone, Telecom Italia, British Telecommunications and France Telecom are trying to raise as much as $25 billion in debt, or three-quarters the amount issued by all telecommunications companies through the first nine months of the year, according to ING Barings.</p>
        <p>Stock issues, meanwhile, are expected to nearly double this year, to $180 billion from $100 billion last year, with nearly half the increase coming in the fourth quarter, UBS Warburg estimates.</p>
        <p>After 18 months of throwing money at the sector, investors are beginning to show signs that they have had enough. The spreads, or differentials, between telecommunications bonds and government securities are widening -- not just for high-yield issues, but for investment-grade debt, too -- as investors demand higher returns for bearing the growing risks associated with financing costly new services. And huge equity deals like the  sales of shares in Telefonica Moviles and Orange have been delayed and are likely to go forward only at reduced levels.</p>
        <p>''There's an awful lot of paper ahead either debt or equity, and there's a weariness on the part of investors'' to absorb it all, said John Tysoe, an analyst with WestLB Panmure.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a growing portion of these stock deals involve a parent company's selling shares in a subsidiary in which it retains control, and that has given some analysts and fund managers pause.</p>
        <p>Leonard Geiger, manager of U.S. Trust's Excelsior Pan-European Fund, with $250 million in assets, said he was considering increasing his portfolio's weighting of European telecommunications stocks, which now stands at 7.9 percent, or about half the market average, because much of the bad news, like the soaring costs of third-generation licenses, had already been priced in.</p>
        <p>Yet, he said he would only buy shares in the parent companies, not in their subsidiaries. ''This has been the year of realization that spinoffs don't work,'' Mr. Geiger noted.</p>
        <p>He points to Deutsche Telekom, which argued that selling shares in T-Online would allow it to offer managers of the Internet portal greater incentives through stock options that more closely matched the subsidiary's performance. Instead, many of T-Online's executives left the company, saying they were stifled by Deutsche Telekom's control. Since going public in April, T-Online shares have fallen 34 percent.</p>
        <p>If these subsidiaries are so good, ''why sell parts of them to the public?'' Mr. Lambert asked.</p>
        <p>One overriding reason is to pay down debt. Although these companies have already seen their credit ratings lowered, further downgrades are likely if they do not reduce their debt loads, said Peter Kernan, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's.  Lower ratings would increase borrowing costs and reduce financial flexibility. In such an environment, ''it becomes more difficult to do deals,'' Mr. Kernan said.</p>
        <p>And so companies that a short time ago thought nothing of buying their way into a market are becoming more choosy. A few weeks ago, for instance, France Telecom abandoned merger talks with the Dutch data network operator Equant, citing unfavorable market conditions. The same week, it diluted its stake in Wind, a joint venture with the Italian utility company Enel, rather than pay cash for Infostrada, which Enel bought from Vodafone and will merge with Wind.</p>
        <p>''In the past, France Telecom would have done both deals,'' Mr. Tysoe, the analyst, said. ''Today, it's either or.''</p>
