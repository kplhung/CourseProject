        <p>With retail sales growing for the first time in a year, BAA P.L.C., Britain's and the world's biggest airport operator, said second-quarter profit rose 27 percent. BAA's revenue from stores at airports like Heathrow and Gatwick, which once accounted for half its sales, were badly hit in the year-earlier period after the European Union outlawed duty-free shopping for travelers within the Union. The company said net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 20 increased to $201 million. BAA shares rose as much as 2.7 percent, to 579 pence. BAA runs 15 airports around the world and is trying to take over Kennedy International and La Guardia in New York.</p>
