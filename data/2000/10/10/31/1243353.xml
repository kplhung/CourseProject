        <p>Backstage at a concert at the Laugardalsholl gymnasium here, Arni Matthiasson fretted about a battle of the bands he planned to judge later in the year in which 50 or so Icelandic groups would compete to win free studio time. ''I'm waiting to see if every band is going to show up playing their guitars with violin bows and making really long songs,'' said Mr. Matthiasson, a music journalist at the daily newspaper Morgunbladid. In his 15 years of covering music, he says, he has never seen the local rock scene take such a turn to the avant-garde as it has recently.</p>
        <p>With claims to the word's highest per capita CD sales and book ownership (not to mention mobile phone use and alcohol consumption), Iceland is flourishing culturally, with new filmmakers, artists and musicians all intermingling in a capital with fewer people than Elizabeth, N.J.</p>
        <p>When told of a city with a blossoming rock movement, one imagines three- and four-piece bands grinding out fast, short and loud rock songs in bars and clubs. But that's not the case in Iceland. Reykjavik, its tiny capital, has a rock scene that has matured well beyond rock and embraced experimentation, electronics, genre-blending and nontraditional instrumentation. It can be heard not just in the deconstructed pop of Bjork but also in the music of scores of new bands that have suddenly emerged in this small, barren and isolated country.</p>
        <p>At the Icelandic Airwaves festival from Oct. 19 to 22, some of Iceland's most popular young bands came out jamming on 10-minute ambient songs (the Sigur Ros group), using four keyboards as their only instruments (Apparat) and playing steel guitar with balloons (Magga Stina).</p>
        <p>''There is no punk scene or dance scene here,'' Mr. Matthiasson explained. ''Each band is a scene in itself -- and it's because each band tries to be distinct because they don't want to sound like their neighbor.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, he adds, there is a flow of musicians among bands. ''The mixture of music each band plays ends up being much greater than other places,'' he said. ''If you're a violinist you might find yourself playing in a noise band because the town is so small and everyone knows each other.''</p>
        <p>Visiting American music industry executives often leave Reykjavik flabbergasted. ''You're looking at a country with only 270,000 people, most of whom live outside Reykjavik,'' said Harry Poloner, an artist-and-repertory executive at EMI Publishing who helped start the Icelandic Airwaves festival after his first visit to the country two years ago. ''But at the same time, look at all the music you've got coming out of there: you've got Bjork becoming one of the most important artists in the world; Emiliana Torrini coming out in America on Virgin Records and Gus Gus on 4AD Records; half a dozen different bands signing to labels in Europe; Ensimi recording with Steve Albini; and Sigur Ros touring with Radiohead.</p>
        <p>''How many cities of that size in America have that much action?'' he said. ''In that sense, it's just phenomenal what's going on.'' (At last year's festival, Mr. Poloner signed the rap-funk-rock band Quarashi to EMI.)</p>
        <p>The most popular new band in the country is Sigur Ros (Victory Rose in English), whose slot as an opening act for Radiohead attracted the interest of major labels like Interscope, which has been trying to sign the band to a major-label deal. As many as 2,000 people attend Sigur Ros's hometown concerts, an impressive number in a city with only 110,000 people. Many say that's a bigger crowd than Iceland's most famous rock band, the Sugarcubes (Bjork's former group), ever attracted. And Sigur Ros's music is far more obscure.</p>
        <p>At a concert in the Frikirkjan i Reykjavik as part of the Icelandic Airwaves festival, the band sang in a self-invented variant of Icelandic and played shrouded in darkness, performing few songs that the audience knew from its albums. Its music filled the cathedral not with melody but with a mood of solemn intensity. Long, meditative songs gradually unfolded into slow-building drones, propulsive space-rock jams and mock-orchestral compositions. For an encore, Sigur Ros brought out Steindor Andersen, a traditional singer who hauntingly recited tales from Iceland's heroic sagas of the Middle Ages.</p>
        <p>Leigh Lust, a senior director for artists and repertory at Elektra Records who was in town for the festival, called the concert ''probably one of the top 10 musical experiences in my entire life. It ranks up there with seeing Al Green at his church and Neil Young on his last acoustic tour.''</p>
        <p>In American cities, bands traversing musical territory similar to Sigur Ros's -- for example, Tortoise in Chicago, Low in Duluth, Minn., and Godspeed You Black Emperor! from Montreal -- have hardly become national pop stars. Sigur Ros, whose  1999 album ''Agaetis Byrjun'' was reported to be the best-selling local release in Iceland that year, also swept up the best album, best artist, best guitarist, best singer and best songwriter awards at the Icelandic Music Awards. Then again, this is Iceland.</p>
        <p>''With technology and the Internet, everything in culture has become very narrow and specific and precise,'' said Einar Orn Benediktsson, a singer in the Sugarcubes and, before that, with local postpunk legends like Purkur Pillnikk and Kukl. ''But in Iceland, you see a mountain, then you turn around and you see another mountain. You look to the left, and there's the sea. We love space and fresh air, and that's why you see so many people at a Sigur Ros concert.''</p>
        <p>Iceland is known for its surreal lunar landscape, two hours of sunlight in the dead of winter, and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Its expanse of glaciers, lava fields and mountains are alluring yet harsh and inhospitable. The music aspires to the same sort of friction between the lush and the abrasive, whether it's in the skittering show tunes of Bjork's soundtrack to ''Dancer in the Dark''; the desultory dance-music of the nine-artist collective Gus Gus (which is still together or has broken up, depending on which member you ask); the experimental soundscapes of Sigur Ros; the whispering feedback-laced pop of Slowblow; the dense rock and light electro fusion of Ensimi and AmPop; or the ambient and natural sound bricolages of Mum. Even the country's more straight-ahead mainstream pop and rock acts, like Toy Machine, Selma and Moa, have something that is a little off in their music.</p>
        <p>''I think the nature here shapes us,'' said Anna Hildur Hildibrandsdottir, who manages the Reykjavik rock bands Botnledja (Silt in English) and Bellatrix. ''You drive 15 minutes outside Reykjavik and you're in a magical world. It's so relaxing and wide open, and that shows in the music because you have such a free spirit and you can do anything musically.'' She paused, then added: ''People sometimes think that Icelanders are weird, but I think that's a good thing.''</p>
        <p>There is a saying in Iceland that every other farmer is a poet. If that's true, then every other city dweller is a musician. Wandering through clubs, one gets blitzed with CD's and invitations to studios to hear a musician's latest experimental project.</p>
        <p>Most musicians are hungry for acclaim outside their small country, and some, like Bellatrix, have ironed the eccentricities out of their music and moved to England to compete. Others are staying put and hoping to effect a Bjork-like crossover on their own terms. While Sigur Ros is Iceland's most important band, Minus is its dark horse in the race for success, with screaming abrasive, sample-filled new-metal that wouldn't be out of place on a bill with Slipknot. Still other acts, like the humorous XXX Rottweiler, which consists of half a dozen ruddy-cheeked blond boys trying to be the Wu-Tang Clan, work best only in the context of their country.</p>
        <p>Though the scene is certainly vibrant, it's not the first time Iceland has been a hotbed of innovative music. Iceland had its own native-language Bob Dylan, Megas, in the 1960's. And in the early 80's, the late arrival of punk created a high-concept do-it-yourself scene, documented in a film called ''Rokk i Reykjavik.'' That postpunk movement brought the Sugarcubes and Bjork,  who were floating around different bands until they coalesced into the arty punk collective Kukl. ''All that Icelandic music grew into today was planted during those years, though the original music wasn't even successful until eight years later,'' said Asmundur Jonsson, who started the label Smeklyeysa (Bad Taste) with members of the Sugarcubes. (The label also releases Sigur Ros's albums.)</p>
        <p>In the 90's new influences flooded into Iceland, from electronica to post-rock. In particular, the heavy, moody rock of bands like the Smashing Pumpkins and Radiohead have been a perfect fit with Icelanders' love of space and intensity.</p>
        <p>''People credit a lot of music in the 90's to Nirvana, but the Smashing Pumpkins were very big and important here,'' said Kristian Mar Olafsson of the Reykjavik space-rock band Utopia. ''They influenced so many bands to do their style of playing slow, then fast, then slow again. But that's getting old now and people are trying to find new stuff. They're either playing very modern rock or computer stuff. The first band to really do that stuff is Sigur Ros. They're on a pedestal now. But I'm afraid that if they get well known internationally, all Icelandic bands will be judged by them and expected to sound like them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lust at Elektra said that Mr. Olafsson had nothing to worry about: after three trips to Iceland, he said, it's easy to recognize the diversity of the scene and the bands' potential for international success.</p>
        <p>''Seeing Quarashi getting signed last year was exciting for me,'' he said. ''It showed me that there is a legitimacy and a viability for this kind of music. I think a lot of bands are really close there, and their quality level is really high. If somebody comes in who can arrange and write songs in English with them, these bands are going to come up with the missing 25 percent. Most American bands are missing a lot more.''</p>
