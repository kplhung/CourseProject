        <p>Jets Coach Al Groh looked like the unhappiest 6-2 coach imaginable today. Midway through the season, the Jets are tied atop their division. But the problems that pockmarked their successful first half, only to be briefly concealed when the Jets produced a string of comeback victories, were on display in all their ugliness in their loss to Buffalo Sunday.</p>
        <p>So when Groh was asked today what he hoped to improve in the second half of the season, he responded, pointedly, ''Interceptions and deep passes.''</p>
        <p>The Jets have given up too many of each in the first half, producing deficits that created the need for the fourth-quarter comebacks that have defined the team. With the Dolphins and the Colts sharing the top perch in the American Football Conference East, it is entirely possible that the Jets could play well in the second half and still not make the playoffs.</p>
        <p>They have a daunting stretch ahead: a game against Denver Sunday, followed by trips to Indianapolis and Miami. Then, two weeks after Miami, Indianapolis at home, followed by Oakland on the road.</p>
        <p>Groh's unhappiness with the free safety position was obvious Sunday, when he dropped the former starter Kevin Williams out of the rotation entirely and started Scott Frost.</p>
        <p>But Groh was indirect and yet uncharacteristically blunt today about Vinny Testaverde's performance.  While Testaverde was answering questions, his backup, Ray Lucas, chimed in, ''We're 6-2, get off his case.'' But Groh was already on it. Groh has repeatedly said that Testaverde was accomplishing the two things that quarterbacks must do: scoring points and winning games.</p>
        <p>But he declined today to offer a critique of Testaverde's performance in the first half of the season, even while singling out interceptions as one of the two crucial areas for the team.</p>
        <p>By not commenting further on Testaverde's first half, Groh was, it seemed, commenting quite clearly on Testaverde's first half.</p>
        <p>''I feel very loyal to players for their effort,'' Groh said. ''While maybe not every player's effort has been perfect, I feel like that loyalty I've gotten from them should be reciprocal. If anyone wants to evaluate or indict their performance, I'll let others do it.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde has thrown 11 interceptions this season, four more than he threw in all of 1998, when he made the Pro Bowl. If he were to continue at this pace, Testaverde would have 22 interceptions, more than he has had in any season since 1989, his dismal third year in Tampa Bay. His overall quarterback rating this season is 74.3, placing him in the bottom half of A.F.C. quarterbacks, and putting him ahead of only nine other starters in the league. But his fourth-quarter numbers continue to be impressive. Testaverde has the league's highest rating in the fourth quarter: 128.3.</p>
        <p>Groh said there was no consistent problem that threaded through the interceptions, but Testaverde disagreed. He said that they had been his fault, the result of poor decisions.</p>
        <p>''For the most part, it's the quarterback's job to make the right decisions, whether under pressure or no pressure,'' Testaverde said. ''He's the one responsible for throwing the football and making the decisions on where it should be thrown.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde had chafed earlier in the season about criticism heaped on him, and he said others -- players and coaches -- had to be accountable for their mistakes that affected offensive performance. But today, when asked if the loss of Keyshawn Johnson and the integration of so many new players on offense since his last full season in 1998 was a factor in his play, Testaverde declined to place the blame there.</p>
        <p>''I can only work, we can only prepare, with the players we have here,'' he said. ''We're 6-2. We've been getting the job done with the players we have in the locker room. Whether we're throwing three picks a game, or coming back from a 23-point deficit, we're getting it done.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde acknowledged, though, that the Jets would have to play better offensively in the second half of the season if they hoped to duplicate their 6-2 start, particularly because Testaverde anticipates using fewer trick plays to help pull out games.</p>
        <p>But while his coach pointed the finger at Testaverde, the quarterback did not seem worried at all.</p>
        <p>''It's always nice to have the stats to go along with the success your team is having,'' he said. ''I listened to Roger Clemens the other night. In the past, he's won 20 games in a season, but he was sent home. This year, he won 13 games, but won the World Series. It doesn't matter how you get there as long as you get there; 1998 was a great year for me personally, but in the end, it didn't mean much because we fell short of our goals. If I throw 30 picks and win the Super Bowl, I'll be much happier.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach AL GROH was not pleased with strong safety VICTOR GREEN's statement last week that the rotation at free safety was causing problems for him, because he has trouble developing a feel for what his teammate is going to do. ''I think it's an excuse for poor performance,'' Groh said. Groh praised the play of CHRIS HAYES, who was second in the rotation behind SCOTT FROST Sunday, but when Groh was asked if he would alter the rotation again this week, he responded, ''I wouldn't want to upset the rotation any more if it's causing players not to play their best.''</p>
