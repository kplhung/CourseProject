        <p>President Clinton said today that Esquire magazine violated an agreement with the White House when it decided to publish a lengthy interview with him before the presidential election,  including Mr. Clinton's contention that Republicans owe the country an apology for their failed effort to remove him from office.</p>
        <p>''Unlike them,'' Mr. Clinton said in the interview, referring to his Congressional critics, ''I have apologized to the American people for what I did wrong, and most Americans think I paid a pretty high price. They never apologized to the country for impeachment. They never apologized for all the things they've done.''</p>

        <p>President Clinton said today that Esquire magazine violated an agreement with the White House when it decided to publish a lengthy interview with him before the presidential election,  including Mr. Clinton's contention that Republicans owe the country an apology for their failed effort to remove him from office.</p>
        <p>''Unlike them,'' Mr. Clinton said in the interview, referring to his Congressional critics, ''I have apologized to the American people for what I did wrong, and most Americans think I paid a pretty high price. They never apologized to the country for impeachment. They never apologized for all the things they've done.''</p>
        <p>The president's comments, which have circulated in news reports and on the Internet in recent days, came at an inopportune time for the Gore campaign, which has been doing everything it can to avoid the taboo subject of impeachment.</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, rejected the president's request for an apology on Sunday on ABC's ''This Week.''</p>
        <p>''It shows you something about his thinking and the judgment that he has,'' Mr. Lott said. ''Look, he disgraced the office. He did things in the Oval Office that are absolutely still incredible, and he lied about it.''</p>
        <p>Asked today about his request for an apology, Mr. Clinton criticized Esquire and said those who read the entire interview would have a balanced view of his sentiments.</p>
        <p>''I was promised faithfully that that interview would be done, released after the election, and I believed it,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>''I would just urge the American people, if they're hearing all this talk, to read exactly what was said,'' he added. ''But I don't think it's appropriate for me to discuss any of this until I'm doing the wrap-up on my administration. Right now, I think the American people should be focused on this election.''</p>
        <p>The magazine and the White House agreed that the interview would appear in the December issue, which hits newsstands in mid-November, officials said.</p>
        <p>But Esquire sent out transcripts to some news organizations in New York and Washington last Thursday and posted a partial transcript on its Web site on Friday. The magazine posted a fuller transcript on its Web site today, and officials there said it would begin hitting newsstands in some major cities later this week.</p>
        <p>''The only deal was that this was going to be the cover of our December issue,'' said David Granger, Esquire's editor in chief. ''The bottom line is it was not embargoed until any date. I'm surprised by the reaction and I feel bad if there's any negative reaction from the White House. It's not meant as an attack. It's an assessment.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Clinton said there were days that he felt bitter about all the attacks on him: ''I gave myself a pity party.'' But overall, he said, the experience humbled him and improved him as a person.</p>
        <p>''It helped me personally to be a better person, to be constantly judged and condemned and torn apart, then to have to confess error and be publicly humiliated and all that,'' he said. ''It really helped me a lot because I think that one of his greatest sins of character almost everybody is vulnerable to is pride.</p>
        <p>''And I think it has really helped me to be less judgmental and less hypocritical. So I think in a funny way, even the bad parts of this, the experience, was quite good for me, and I think it will make me a better person for the rest of my life.''</p>
        <p>He also talked about the difficulties he expects to face adjusting to life outside the White House, and the busy schedule he plans to keep.</p>
