        <p>Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column says watching events in West Bank is like watching modern form of ritual sacrifice; says Palestinians seem to have no qualms about putting up their youths to be shot at, and Israeli soldiers seem to have no qualms about shooting them; says latest fighting has punctured cherished myths on both sides: for Israel, notion that it can have peace while holding on to settlements, and for Palestinians notion that they can get back land while holding on to their rejection of Israel (M)</p>

        <p>Here's a day in the life of Israel and Palestine: I arrive in Jerusalem from Hong Kong at 5 a.m. The taxi drops me at the door of the King David Hotel. I walk in. The lobby is completely dark and empty. Not a soul, not a bellhop, is stirring, not even a mouse. ''Hello,'' I shout into the dark, wondering if my travel agent has made a mistake and the hotel has been closed. ''Is anybody home? Hello!'' Finally a desk clerk emerges from a dark corner, where he has been sleeping on a couch. The hotel has laid off most of its employees, because tourism is dead. ''Am I the only one staying here?'' I ask. The clerk just chuckles.</p>
        <p>The following morning I drive to Ramallah with a Palestinian journalist friend. When we arrive at the back entrance to the city, a ''clash'' is underway. There is a long, wide street. The Israeli soldiers are on our end hiding behind three armored cars, popping out to fire tear gas, rubber bullets and real bullets at the Palestinian youths, who are pelting the soldiers with rocks and marbles from behind a pile of burned-out cars. Behind the Palestinians, five Palestinian ambulances are parked. When a Palestinian youth goes down, an ambulance races out, siren screaming, and the wounded boy is bundled off to the hospital, like a Roman gladiator scraped up off the ring. Behind them, a crowd of 300 Palestinians, of various ages, are simply watching the scene. A vendor is selling kebabs.</p>

        <p>Here's a day in the life of Israel and Palestine: I arrive in Jerusalem from Hong Kong at 5 a.m. The taxi drops me at the door of the King David Hotel. I walk in. The lobby is completely dark and empty. Not a soul, not a bellhop, is stirring, not even a mouse. ''Hello,'' I shout into the dark, wondering if my travel agent has made a mistake and the hotel has been closed. ''Is anybody home? Hello!'' Finally a desk clerk emerges from a dark corner, where he has been sleeping on a couch. The hotel has laid off most of its employees, because tourism is dead. ''Am I the only one staying here?'' I ask. The clerk just chuckles.</p>
        <p>The following morning I drive to Ramallah with a Palestinian journalist friend. When we arrive at the back entrance to the city, a ''clash'' is underway. There is a long, wide street. The Israeli soldiers are on our end hiding behind three armored cars, popping out to fire tear gas, rubber bullets and real bullets at the Palestinian youths, who are pelting the soldiers with rocks and marbles from behind a pile of burned-out cars. Behind the Palestinians, five Palestinian ambulances are parked. When a Palestinian youth goes down, an ambulance races out, siren screaming, and the wounded boy is bundled off to the hospital, like a Roman gladiator scraped up off the ring. Behind them, a crowd of 300 Palestinians, of various ages, are simply watching the scene. A vendor is selling kebabs.</p>
        <p>We then drive around a few blocks and come up and watch from the Palestinian side. Soon after we get there a bullet from an Israeli sniper ricochets and hits a Palestinian girl in the leg. The ambulance scoops her away. Palestinian boys in leather jackets -- armed with automatic rifles and looking like extras from the movie ''West Beirut'' -- roam around firing back at the Israelis. On a rooftop, a crew from Qatar's Al-Jazira satellite TV station is broadcasting the whole scene live all over the Arab world. Around the corner, older Palestinian men are smoking water pipes at a coffee house, taking no notice.</p>
        <p>You feel as if you are watching a modern form of ritual sacrifice. The Palestinians seem to have no qualms about putting up their youths to be shot at, and the Israeli soldiers seem to have no qualms about shooting them. We go to Ramallah Hospital. A crowd of 20 people is in the emergency ward, watching as each youth is brought in. The mood is a mix of pride and horror. One boy, lying wounded on a stretcher, seems happy to have acquired his bullet badge of honor and still be alive. The next boy is not so lucky. He is shot in the face and chest. The doctors are cutting off his clothes. The crowd cranes to see what's going on. More ambulances arrive. More ''martyrs.'' Wounded are O.K., but martyrs are better -- because martyrs produce the media images that create the most pressure on Israel.</p>
        <p>This war is sick, but it has exposed some basic truths. First, the Israeli propaganda that the Palestinians mostly rule themselves in the West Bank is fatuous nonsense. Sure, the Palestinians control their own towns, but the Israelis control all the roads connecting these towns and therefore all their movements. Israeli confiscation of Palestinian land for more settlements is going on to this day -- seven years into Oslo. There's no hope for peace here without a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Second, to think that the Palestinians are only enraged about settlements is also fatuous nonsense. Talk to the 15-year-olds. Their grievance is not just with Israeli settlements, but with Israel. Most Palestinians simply do not accept that the Jews have any authentic right to be here. For this reason, any Palestinian state that comes into being should never be permitted to have any heavy weapons, because if the Palestinians had them today their extremists would be using them on Tel Aviv. But this war is also a revolt of Palestinian youth against the corrupt tyranny of Yasir Arafat, who has turned their wrath on Israel to deflect it from himself.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: Up to now, both sides have been trying to make peace while holding on to their most cherished myths -- for Israel it is the notion that it can have peace while holding on to settlements, and for the Palestinians it is the notion that they can get back land while holding on to their rejection of Israel. This latest fighting has punctured both those illusions, and peace talks should resume only when the parties admit that to themselves and to each other.</p>
