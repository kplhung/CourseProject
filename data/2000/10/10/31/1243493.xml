        <p>The Food and Drug Administration is re-evaluating the drug Lotronex because of serious side effects and five deaths among women taking it for irritable bowel syndrome, agency officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Dr. Florence Houn, director of the agency's office of drug evaluation, said it was not yet known whether the problems were actually caused by the drug.</p>
        <p>Lotronex was approved in February to treat women with chronic diarrhea resulting from irritable bowel syndrome.</p>
        <p>In August, reports of serious side effects led the food and drug agency to order that the maker of Lotronex, Glaxo Wellcome Inc., change the drug's labeling and include warnings about two dangerous side effects: complications from severe constipation and ischemic colitis, in which blood flow to parts of the gut was cut off. In August, there were 15 cases and no deaths. By Oct. 20, Dr. Houn said, there were 70 cases and 5 deaths.</p>
