Grandmother of Jordana and Valerie. Widow of Wally Weber. Graduate of Wellesley/'31.

Memorial servies will be held at Temple Emanu-El, 65 Street and Fifth Ave. at noon on Thursday, November 2. Contributions in her memory may be made to Temple Emanu-El or the Wellesley College Fund, Wellesley, MA. She was truly an original.</p>
