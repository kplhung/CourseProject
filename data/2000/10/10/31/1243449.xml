        <p>AL GORE  Remarks yesterday in Fond du Lac, Wis.:</p>
        <p>''The H.M.O.'s and the insurance companies want to keep control of the medical decisions because it helps their bottom line. The fact that it doesn't help your health sometimes seems not to matter.</p>
        <p>They want Governor Bush to be in control of the policy because they support him and he supports them. They know that I have never been afraid or unwilling to take on the H.M.O.'s or the insurance companies or any other powerful interest, if they are operating in a way that is contrary to what your best interest is.</p>
        <p>The reason why they've been able to block this law in Congress . . . is that they've used their tremendous political power and their campaign contributions and their lobbying power to block this bill. . . .</p>
        <p>I know where the rats in the barn are. I've got 24 years of experience in fighting against the special interests and the rats in the barn know that I know, and that's why they're coming out to try to help stop this campaign.</p>
        <p>You better believe it. That one day that comes around every four years is coming around Nov. 7, eight days from now. I need your help.''</p>
