        <p>Members of the DeCavalcante crime family in New Jersey learned last November about pending arrests through a leak from an investigation and plotted to kill mobsters they believed were cooperating with the investigators, according to a federal prosecutor.</p>
        <p>None of the murder plots were carried out, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors in the office of Mary Jo White, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, were investigating the leak, but would provide no details last week. It was unclear whether the leak came from a law enforcement source, a grand juror or someone else in the court system who might have access to secret grand jury materials.</p>
        <p>The existence of the leak was disclosed at an Oct. 19 hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan for the man prosecutors have called an acting boss of the DeCavalcante family, Charles Majuri. In a federal indictment unsealed that day, Mr. Majuri was one of a dozen accused of being members and associates of the family and charged with murder, loan sharking and labor racketeering.</p>
        <p>''As a direct result of that leak back in November of 1999, the defendants in this case engaged in several conspiracies to murder people that they suspected were cooperating'' with the government, John M. Hillebrecht, an assistant United States attorney, told United States Magistrate Judge Frank Maas at the hearing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hillebrecht, who is prosecuting the case along with an assistant United States attorney, Lisa P. Korologos, said the indictment included one count of obstruction of justice against Anthony Mannarino, 55. The charge involved ''a leak from sources to other organized crime figures about the impending arrests of other members of the DeCavalcante family,'' Mr. Hillebrecht said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Majuri's lawyer, Mitchell A. Golub, questioned the depth of the government's evidence in a telephone interview last week. ''It appears there is a lot of smoke there,'' Mr. Golub said. ''I don't know how much fire they actually have.''</p>
        <p>In arguing that Mr. Majuri, 59, should be held without bail, Mr. Hillebrecht called the DeCavalcante family ''a large, disciplined, organized gang of killers, guys who are willing to kill at the drop of a hat'' to protect their financial interests and ''to kill people who they just speculate might, in the future, become cooperators.''</p>
        <p>Witnesses cooperating with the government were prepared to testify that they had ''specific and detailed conversations with other high-ranking members of the organization in addition to Mr. Majuri about the existence of a plan, and contacts in Sicily with safe houses ready and the ability on a moment's notice to get out,'' Mr. Hillebrecht said.</p>
