        <p>For years, there has been talk about elevating one or two colleges of the City University of New York to flagship campuses with research capacity, prestige and drawing power like that of the Berkeley campus of the University of California.</p>
        <p>But CUNY officials have found it difficult to make the case. Top-ranked research institutions are extremely expensive. New York City and New York State already have an abundance of first-tier private research universities. And elevating one institution over another would be virtually impossible politically in a city where borough presidents and other government officials cherish their Hunters and Lehmans.</p>

        <p>For years, there has been talk about elevating one or two colleges of the City University of New York to flagship campuses with research capacity, prestige and drawing power like that of the Berkeley campus of the University of California.</p>
        <p>But CUNY officials have found it difficult to make the case. Top-ranked research institutions are extremely expensive. New York City and New York State already have an abundance of first-tier private research universities. And elevating one institution over another would be virtually impossible politically in a city where borough presidents and other government officials cherish their Hunters and Lehmans.</p>
        <p>Rather than trying to make the case for a flagship campus, Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor, has begun trying to sell a different vision, one that he says would achieve some of the same benefits in prestige and economic impact but cost far less.</p>
        <p>Under the strategy, which he has taken on the road in recent weeks, Dr. Goldstein is trying to raise the status of select programs at various campuses to levels of national prominence, but not consolidate them on one star campus. He would also like to attract more top students by giving them special treatment.</p>
        <p>In doing so, he hopes ''to change the conversation'' about CUNY from one that dwells on remediation and failure to one that emphasizes the university's stellar professors and other strengths, he said.</p>
        <p>CUNY has already begun to put the plan in place. It formed the backbone of the university's master plan, which the State Board of Regents approved last month. Since last year, 20 percent of all new faculty members have been senior professors hired for specific programs at select CUNY colleges.</p>
        <p>Last year, the hiring focused on four fields -- photonics, new media and computer science, teacher education and foreign languages -- fields in which CUNY already had some strength and wanted more prominence. This year, it added structural biology and art history and the visual arts. In photonics, the study of the use of light to transmit information, City College, in Manhattan, will get a large share of the new faculty members, but other campuses will get some, too.</p>
        <p>Last week, to win support and allies, Dr. Goldstein presented the strategy -- which he calls ''creating a flagship environment'' -- to more than 200 business executives, civic leaders and educators at meetings held by the New York University School of Education and by the Center for Educational Innovation-Public Education Association.</p>
        <p>''You might ask why we do not have an Ann Arbor or a Chapel Hill or a Berkeley,'' Dr. Goldstein said, naming some highly regarded flagship academic institutions at an N.Y.U. breakfast. The answer is, ''It's not appropriate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said CUNY had a limited budget and 20 campuses in close proximity. Investing selectively, he said, will allow CUNY to build strengths ''that emulate some of the great flagship campuses'' and serve as a symbol of excellence. CUNY, which serves nearly 200,000 students, has a budget of $1.4 billion for the 2000-2001 year.</p>
        <p>At both meetings, the strategy was greeted with interest and applause by many outside the university.</p>
        <p>''It's a responsible, interesting idea that seems to be well thought out and consistent with the university's mission,'' said one of the speakers at the N.Y.U. meeting, Patrick Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education in San Jose, Calif.</p>
        <p>It would be impossible for CUNY to recreate a Berkeley, particularly in a short amount of time, he said. ''This seems to me to be a more realistic approach,'' he added. ''I have no idea if it will work, but it was not dreamed up out of whole cloth.''</p>
        <p>Seymour Fliegel, president of the Center for Educational Innovation-Public Education Association and a City College graduate, also applauded the plan.</p>
        <p>''If we can restore CUNY to some degree of national prominence, it would be wonderful for the kids who go there,'' he said yesterday. ''Goldstein's trying to really upgrade the university, and I think he already has. You don't hear all that negative stuff about CUNY anymore.''</p>
        <p>Inside CUNY, however, not everyone is applauding. Many faculty leaders say the plan does not go far enough to restore the university's health after years of budget cuts.</p>
        <p>Barbara Bowen, president of the Professional Staff Congress, the faculty and staff union, said she welcomed the hiring of more full-time faculty members but stressed that the rebuilding of CUNY ought to take place in all departments, not just a few.</p>
        <p>''We are not arguing for a little here and a little there,'' she said. ''We are arguing for a change in the public mind-set. New York City and New York State need a great university. The alternative to flagship programs is a serious long-term effort to turn around the entire university.''</p>
        <p>Bernard Sohmer, chairman of CUNY's faculty senate, said the changes might help CUNY in the graduate school rankings, but ''will mostly be peripheral to undergraduate education.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Goldstein contends that image and substance are both important, and that building some high-profile academic programs will help CUNY attract more public money for those programs and for the university in general.</p>
        <p>''As the university starts to reclaim its position in higher education, it will be very hard for the governor and the mayor to deny us more funding,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The strategy of backing the strongest professors from all campuses parallels CUNY's consortium-style graduate program, which draws its faculty from all campuses to one central graduate campus in mid-Manhattan. Of the 22 CUNY graduate center programs that were evaluated in a National Research Council survey published in 1995, 9 were ranked among the top 20 nationally.</p>
        <p>CUNY has also begun to recruit 100 students for a university-wide honors program on five campuses: Baruch, Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens Colleges. The program, which it plans to expand eventually, will piggyback on the honors programs already on some campuses. Each student will be guaranteed full tuition, a laptop computer and other perquisites. Most will also participate in honors programs on their home campuses, where they are often put into smaller classes with distinguished professors.</p>
        <p>Some professors have expressed concerns that minority students may not be well represented in a university-wide honors program and that extra money spent on a few honors students means less money for everyone else.</p>
        <p>But the audiences last week were more encouraging. Many at the N.Y.U. gathering seemed to share the opinion of Ann Marcus, dean of N.Y.U.'s School of Education, who said, ''Goldstein inspires confidence in people.''</p>
        <p>''Even people who think the flagship idea is window dressing are won over by his demeanor and confidence,'' she said. ''He is beginning to communicate with a lot of different constituencies who are starting to feel that maybe this place is worth looking at.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 1, 2000, Wednesday  A picture caption yesterday about City University's efforts to hire outstanding scholars misspelled the surnames of two award-winning faculty members. They are Profs. Jill Bargonetti (not Bargontti) and Judith Summerfield (not Sommerfield). The caption also referred imprecisely to them and to Edwin G. Burrows, John Corigliano, Cecilia Macheski and Daniel Akins. CUNY officials cited them as examples of the caliber of professor it sought to recruit; none of the six were recently hired.</p>
