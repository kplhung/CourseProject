        <p>Steichen on Steichen</p>
        <p>In 1959, Joanna Steichen, an ambitious young copywriter, experienced something common to many career women in New York: she met a nice guy through an acquaintance. The acquaintance was Carl Sandburg, and the guy was Edward Steichen, creator of ''The Family of Man'' exhibition and the chief photographer for Conde Nast magazines from 1923 to 1938. A year later, the two married; Mrs. Steichen was 27, her husband, 81.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure the age difference was as important as the difference in our agendas,'' Mrs. Steichen said recently. ''He wanted an assistant; I wanted to write.'' Still, the couple stayed together until Mr. Steichen's death in 1973, and in the meantime Mrs. Steichen became a psychotherapist. She long wanted to produce a book combining her husband's images with her reflections on their life. ''I'd known for 27 years that I wanted to do something, but I wanted to put some perspective between living with Steichen and the man as an artist,'' she said.</p>

        <p>Steichen on Steichen</p>
        <p>In 1959, Joanna Steichen, an ambitious young copywriter, experienced something common to many career women in New York: she met a nice guy through an acquaintance. The acquaintance was Carl Sandburg, and the guy was Edward Steichen, creator of ''The Family of Man'' exhibition and the chief photographer for Conde Nast magazines from 1923 to 1938. A year later, the two married; Mrs. Steichen was 27, her husband, 81.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure the age difference was as important as the difference in our agendas,'' Mrs. Steichen said recently. ''He wanted an assistant; I wanted to write.'' Still, the couple stayed together until Mr. Steichen's death in 1973, and in the meantime Mrs. Steichen became a psychotherapist. She long wanted to produce a book combining her husband's images with her reflections on their life. ''I'd known for 27 years that I wanted to do something, but I wanted to put some perspective between living with Steichen and the man as an artist,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The result, ''Steichen's Legacy,'' has just been published and serves as a companion to an exhibition at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in SoHo. It also comes at the same time as a show at the Whitney Museum, which Mrs. Steichen criticizes for what she says is an overemphasis on her late husband's fashion work. ''It was a detour in his career,'' Mrs. Steichen said. ''It helped him support his wife and his ex-wife and his children.'' Mrs. Steichen is also upset that she was not asked to participate in a symposium on the photographer's work organized by the curator of the show at the Whitney, Barbara Haskell.</p>
        <p>Ms. Haskell, who pointed out that fashion images make up only about one-eighth of the images in the exhibition, said she did not invite Mrs. Steichen because she was seeking newer voices. ''Although Joanna's book is wonderful,'' Ms. Haskell said, ''the actual description of the work is what her husband would have said.''</p>
        <p>Centrist Fashions</p>
        <p>''The most avant-garde person could be an arch conservative these days -- you just can't tell anymore,'' said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. It was with this flummoxing reality in mind that Mr. Doonan set about planning Election Day windows for the Madison Avenue store that would not alienate buyers of $400 Helmut Lang pants on either the left or the right. ''In retail, I think it's important to retain a neutral stance,'' he said. The results of that neutral stance are on display: renditions of 41 of the 42 American presidents fashioned from old license plates from the leaders' home states. The series is the work of Michael Kalish, a Los Angeles sculptor, whom Mr. Doonan discovered through an art dealer. Mr. Kalish, 27, started rummaging through flea markets for old plates and hammering out images of people like Warren G. Harding over two years ago for reasons he can't exactly pinpoint. ''I love Americana,'' Mr. Kalish said. ''I started first with Reagan and Kennedy. Then I started doing more obscure presidents, like Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore. Before, I didn't even know who Millard Fillmore was.''</p>
        <p>And Centrist Product Placement</p>
        <p>The press material for the Showtime television series ''Queer as Folk,'' which has its premiere in December, describes it as ''an unapologetic celebration of life in all its varied forms.'' Fashion companies generally jump at the chance to have their clothes worn by TV characters with a forward-thinking mindset. But some fashion houses, according to a spokeswoman for the program, have been reluctant.</p>
        <p>''Queer as Folk'' is based on a controversial British television series, which focused on a group of gay friends and didn't shy away from explicit sex. The Showtime series has been recast in Pittsburgh for an American audience and has  characters like Ted, described as ''a nice-looking but average fellow, an accountant with a taste for porn.'' According to Liza Burnett, a publicist for the program, Polo Ralph Lauren and Versace have turned down requests for the use of their clothes. Lynn Tesoro, publicity director for Ralph Lauren, said she was unaware of receiving a request from the show for apparel.</p>
        <p>The National Football League also turned down the program. In a letter to the producers, Carol Lucas, the league's marketing manager, said that based on the program's subject, it could not consent to the use of team T-shirts and hats. Some companies, however, are game, including Levi Strauss and Robert Marc, the eyewear company.</p>
