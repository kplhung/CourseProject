        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks yesterday at an elementary school in Bosque Farms, N.M.:</p>
        <p>''Character education is being taught in this school, and I suspect it's one of the key ingredients why this school is doing well in the accountability system in New Mexico. It is a proper role for the federal government to fund character education programs all across America. We should not be afraid in our society to teach values which have stood the test of time; values that when our youngsters learn them, will make them better citizens in this great land; values that ultimately help them make the right choices in life.</p>

        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks yesterday at an elementary school in Bosque Farms, N.M.:</p>
        <p>''Character education is being taught in this school, and I suspect it's one of the key ingredients why this school is doing well in the accountability system in New Mexico. It is a proper role for the federal government to fund character education programs all across America. We should not be afraid in our society to teach values which have stood the test of time; values that when our youngsters learn them, will make them better citizens in this great land; values that ultimately help them make the right choices in life.</p>
        <p>We ought to have Internet filters in public schools and public libraries so as to keep pornography and violence out of the hands of children. We ought to work to have 'family hour' on television programs so that a parent will know that there's programs that are worthy to be in their home. We also ought to encourage parents to use the off-on button if they're not happy with what's coming into their home. One of the themes I addressed in this campaign last week, and I will continue to talk about it some this week, is the need for our nation to work together to have a period of time, a culture that says each of us is responsible for the decisions we make in life; that if you're a mom or a dad, you're responsible for loving your children, are responsible, period. Responsibility starts at home. But one of the most crucial parts about making sure this American experience shines brightly for everybody -- 'para todos' -- is that every child be educated. Part of having a responsible society is to have educated children, children not only who have earned self-esteem by being able to learn, but children who have been taught by a compassionate society that there are right choices to make in life and wrong choices to make in life. We have come to this.  Prior to the big rally at the airport, where they're telling me that a lot of folks are out there ready to scream, I'm glad we were invited here to be able to talk about an important issue, to be able to herald success, to be able to highlight that local control of schools works, to be able to speak about a community that has come together to provide a hopeful future for every child, regardless of their background, regardless of where their parents may have been born -- for every single child.''</p>
