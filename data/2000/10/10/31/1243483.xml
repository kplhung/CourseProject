        <p>Nothing in Representative Rick A. Lazio's career gives him greater pride than his record on housing.</p>
        <p>As a young congressman, he made housing his focal issue. It was an unorthodox choice, especially for a Republican representing suburban Long Island, far from the federally financed high-rise projects of New York City.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Newt Gingrich, who was then speaker of the House, rewarded Mr. Lazio's loyalty to Republicans by naming him chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity: a remarkable promotion for someone just finishing his freshman term and a position he has used in his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton to highlight his housing expertise.</p>
        <p>''I've been very active on housing issues, on helping the homeless, helping poor people with public housing, helping Native Americans,'' Mr. Lazio said in the campaign's final debate on Friday. He said that he had also fought for affordable housing and for housing with extra services for the elderly.</p>
        <p>In her own housing proposals, Mrs. Clinton has called for tripling the number of federal rental aid vouchers to 330,000 nationally at a cost of $2 billion. She also advocates more public housing; renewed tax credits of $1 billion annually to build 180,000 low-income homes in five years; raising the limits on federally sponsored mortgages to $250,000 from $217,000; and increasing aid to $75 million a year, from $30 million, for centers to house and assist the elderly and disabled.</p>
        <p>She and others have criticized Mr. Lazio's record, but opinions among housing groups and officials are mixed.</p>
        <p>''Special-needs groups like him a lot; public housing people don't like him at all,'' said Irene E. Baldwin, director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a coalition of 90 neighborhood groups.</p>
        <p>Other organizations gave Mr. Lazio high marks as a champion of their causes. ''Lazio has really taken a leadership role for people with disabilities,'' said Andrew Sperling, policy director for the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, based in Virginia. The president of the New York Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, Carl Young, called Mr. Lazio ''one of the few in Congress who understood'' the issues of housing and serving the elderly. Christopher D. Boesen, a onetime Lazio aide and now director of the National American Indian Housing Council, called him ''an unlikely hero of Indian housing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has campaigned enthusiastically on his housing record: he devoted his first policy speech of the campaign to the topic, and a television ad on his legislative achievements leads with that subject. He declined to discuss his record for this article.</p>
        <p>The Lazio for Senate Web site promotes 20 housing accomplishments, each with its own page. ''As housing chairman, Lazio is responsible for leading Congressional efforts to reform housing and community policies for the 21st century,'' the Web site says.</p>
        <p>Some critics say Mr. Lazio has hurt housing aid for the poor and for families. They note that he was a deputy whip to Mr. Gingrich, who called for abolishing the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Lazio told Newsday in 1996 that he singlehandedly saved HUD: ''This may sound maybe arrogant, but if I was not in the House, it would have passed an elimination of HUD.''</p>
        <p>Some consider Mr. Lazio's own proposals to be more far-reaching than even the Gingrich agenda. Mr. Lazio proposed the repeal of the Housing Act of 1937 -- a cornerstone of Roosevelt's New Deal, the foundation of national housing policy and of 160 later laws.</p>
        <p>Congress refused to go along with the repeal, but the Republican majority did cut funds for housing. Early in Mr. Lazio's chairmanship, Congress imposed a record cut of one-fourth, or $6 billion, in HUD's budget, without hearings. For the first time since rental aid began in the 1970's, new vouchers for the needy were cut off, a freeze that lasted four years until Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo forced a showdown.</p>
        <p>''Basically, housing programs have never recovered,'' said the subcommittee's ranking Democrat at the time, Joseph P. Kennedy II of Massachusetts. Despite long waiting lists, Congress halted major new construction. The committee's current top Democrat, Barney Frank of Massachusetts, said Mr. Lazio ''helped get the federal government out of the business of increasing the affordable housing supply.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Lazio, Dan McLagan, responded: ''It's funny that virtually everyone on the left, including President Clinton and Cuomo II, had nothing but praise for Rick Lazio on housing until he ran against Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Some critics say Mr. Lazio passed few significant bills in his committee. Much legislation that he claims as his is similar to Clinton administration proposals and other legislators' bills, they say. Some programs he takes credit for, like the one to house urban teachers near their schools, were already operating under prior laws.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Lazio's charm, some politicians say that his stubbornness exasperated key Republicans, dooming pet proposals to legislative gridlock. He crossed swords with powers like former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and the Senate's housing chairman, Connie Mack of Florida. One such dispute was over a move to restore cuts on housing for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''I remember that D'Amato and Connie Mack were just outraged that Rick was trying to hold up this money'' for that program, said Representative Michael P. Forbes, a Republican-turned-Democrat in a district next to Mr. Lazio's. ''They fought him every step of the way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mack said: ''Listen, I was right in the middle of this, and all of us had particular concerns, so it's natural that you bump heads. He's got an incredibly upbeat personality, but he can be tough as hell. He can be tenacious.'' But the end result, he said, was solid legislation on various housing issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has also clashed with Mr. Cuomo, a rival not only on housing but also in statewide political aspirations. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, supports Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Big donations from the housing industry to the Lazio campaign were the cause of a heated exchange between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton in their last debate. She accused him of accepting donations from the manufactured housing industry and then sponsoring legislation ''to weaken the safety standards'' for such housing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio vehemently denied her charge. ''That's absolutely false, and you know it, Mrs. Clinton,'' he said. He claimed that his proposal had been endorsed by HUD and by the American Association of Retired Persons. But his original bill was opposed by both HUD and A.A.R.P., and only after he made concessions did they back a later compromise.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has also accused Mr. Lazio of voting the way that donors in the mortgage banking industry wanted and against his district's interests by opposing bigger government-backed mortgages for high-cost areas like his own.</p>
        <p>The paramount achievement that Mr. Lazio cites is the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998. ''The most sweeping reform in public housing history was authored by me and passed in the House and signed into law, which I'm proud to say,'' he said in the debate.</p>
        <p>Others say that he took too much credit, and that he delayed passage of the legislation. In 1995, he introduced a radical revamping of public housing that echoed the overhaul of welfare. He proposed civic work duties for residents, time limits on residency, higher rents, a change of more than half the makeup of public housing from poor to moderate income and privatizing New York City's public housing.</p>
        <p>''It was a hurricane-force attack on public housing residents,'' said Victor Bach, housing analyst for the Community Service Society, a 150-year-old nonprofit agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has said that his main goal was to upgrade the quality of life for everyone in public housing by ensuring that more working people lived there to provide role models for children and a more mixed economic base.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio portrayed public housing as ''hulks of despair.'' Despite the vivid demolition of a few bad projects, Mr. Kennedy said that the stereotype ''was not true of New York City and not true of 90 percent of public housing in America.''</p>
        <p>Unable to win over his own party and unwilling to compromise, Mr. Lazio saw his plan languish for three years. Finally Senate leaders negotiated crucial issues with Mr. Cuomo through another committee. This committee passed a new bill, which became law.</p>
        <p>Some of the Lazio proposals were either dropped or watered down. Public housing managers who had supported his proposals to give them more control were disappointed. ''The final product was not as far-reaching as my membership would have liked,'' said Timothy G. Kaiser, executive director of the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, a national group.</p>
        <p>The work requirement survived, but with more exemptions. The final law also reserved some public housing for moderate-income families, but much less than Mr. Lazio wanted. While workers are desirable role models, Mr. Kennedy said, making room for them means keeping out the neediest people, those without jobs.</p>
        <p>Nationally, four million families live in public housing, subsidized apartments or rental units aided by vouchers. Ten million more are eligible, but years of cuts leave little hope. Ed Williams, president of the Public Housing Residents National Organizing Campaign, a tenants group, said: ''Most folks on the waiting list will never, ever get a chance.''</p>
        <p>In New York City alone, said Mr. Bach, the modified Lazio change ''will close more doors to about 15,000 families on the waiting list in 10 years.''</p>
        <p>RACE FOR THE SENATE  Issues: Housing</p>
        <p>This is the fifth in a series of articles examining positions of the candidates in the New York Senate race. The others looked at taxes, social services, foreign policy and education.</p>
