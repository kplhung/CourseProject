        <p>New Jersey's younger residents are running out of unregulated ways to ride.</p>
        <p>With children up to age 14 already required to wear helmets on bicycles and skateboards, and a bill pending to require helmets while on foot-powered scooters, the Assembly voted 75 to 0 yesterday to ban motorized scooters and motorized skateboards from public streets.</p>
        <p>If approved by the State Senate and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has not taken a position on it, the measure would be the nation's first to regulate the motorized devices, its sponsor said.</p>
        <p>Officials acknowledge that motorized scooters and motorized skateboards are neither as common nor as commonly linked to accidents as foot-powered scooters, which have been involved in soaring numbers of accidents nationwide and in the death of a 6-year-old boy in Elizabeth, N.J., last month.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the Division of State Police, the State Division of Motor Vehicles, the State Division of Highway Traffic Safety and the Federal Highway Administration said their agencies did not track accidents involving motorized scooters, and had not heard of any deaths linked to them.</p>
        <p>But the vehicles have attracted the attention of Assemblyman Kenneth C. LeFevre, a Brigantine Republican who introduced the bill. He said his neighbors had asked if he could do something about the motorized scooters, which sound like speeding lawn mowers when their mufflers are removed to add a few miles per hour to their top speed. Mr. LeFevre said he had heard of riders scooting along at 25 miles per hour, without headlights, taillights, turn signals or any other safety features.</p>
        <p>''These kids are blowing through stop signs and red lights on public streets,'' he said. ''We're talking about unregulated vehicles. They're uninsured, and they're operated by unlicensed drivers.''</p>
        <p>The motor scooters have also posed an enforcement problem for the police, because they are not mentioned in the state motor vehicle statute, which the bill passed yesterday would amend.</p>
        <p>''It was last summer that we had all the problems with them,'' said Chief William Ferris of the Brigantine Police Department, ''and they were quite a nuisance for us because there were no laws.''</p>
        <p>The ban would be the first of its kind, said Mr. LeFevre and Steve Patmont, the president of Patmont Motor Werks of Livermore, Calif., and the inventor of the Go-Ped, a popular motor scooter model.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey is just a state that seems to oppress rather than create an environment of freedom,'' said Mr. Patmont, 52, a self-proclaimed libertarian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patmont said the Go-Ped can reach a top speed of 16 m.p.h. and is safer than a bicycle, which he notes can go faster and puts the rider in a more vulnerable position than the Go-Ped does. In any event, he added, ''my invention was not intended for use on public streets.''</p>
        <p>And at $595, it was hardly intended for purchase by children acting without their parents' knowledge, said Patrick Gallagher, sales manager at a Yamaha dealership in Hamilton, N.J. Mr. Gallagher said he sold the Go-Ped only to adults shopping for their teenage children.</p>
        <p>''It's almost like a steppingstone till they get their driver's license,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallagher said state regulation might be a good idea. He also said he favored a measure that would allow municipalities to designate official motor scooter and skateboard areas, like they do with skateboard parks.</p>
