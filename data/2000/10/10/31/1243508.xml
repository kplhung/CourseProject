        <p>Once again, the city all but carried them on its shoulders up Broadway yesterday, as police officers parted the crush of their admirers and sanitation workers swept debris from their path. And once again, hundreds of thousands of people took off from work and school to jam Lower Manhattan, throw fists of confetti and holler themselves hoarse, all in their honor.</p>
        <p>They are neither war heroes nor astronauts; they are simply baseball players. But within their narrow, highly specialized field, the New York Yankees proved they are among the best teams in sports history last week by winning their fourth World Series in five years. And for the fourth time in five years, the city threw the Yankees a parade that was equal parts joyous, idolatrous and corny. Only this time, even more so.</p>
        <p>That is because the vanquished of past Series came from Atlanta and San Diego, cities that do little more than annoy Yankee fans. This year, their Yankees beat the other New York team, the Mets -- a fact that seemed to heighten the pitch of the primal, plaintive cry that echoed down Broadway: ''Let's Go Yankees!''</p>
        <p>The Mets management and their players declined the city's invitation to join the parade, perhaps having recognized that even on the frilliest of floats they still would have looked like prisoners of war being trotted out for public ridicule.</p>
        <p>It was best, for one clear and chilly day in late October, to cede the lower end of Manhattan to the likes of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Yankee devotee, and his kindred spirit, Joel Deutsch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutsch, 20, arrived at Broadway, along the western stretch of City Hall Park, at 4:30 yesterday morning. His hand was healing from an accident with a Champagne bottle after a Yankee home run during the World Series, his shoulder was tattooed with the Yankee logo, and his conscience was clear, having told his employer -- a special education program in Brooklyn -- long ago that he would be absent the day of the Yankee parade.</p>
        <p>He was a Yankee fan, he explained, before adding: ''Aaaaaahhhh!''</p>
        <p>However inarticulate he was at the moment, Mr. Deutsch was wise to have arrived before dawn to stake out his position. By late morning, and with hours to go before the parade's noontime kickoff, people were pressed four and five deep against the police barriers along the route, while thousands of others milled along side streets.</p>
        <p>Together they created a celebratory sea of Yankee blue and white that rose and fell against downtown's shores, from Battery Park, where the parade was to begin, to Chambers Street behind City Hall, where it was to end.</p>
        <p>The sounds of this sea included the broken bits of Yankee chants, the earnest pitches of unlicensed vendors and the steady hum of childish anticipation.</p>
        <p>''World Series shirts,'' a tiny woman called out. ''Five dollar, five dollar.'' Another shouted, ''Yankee pennants here, Yankee pennants.''</p>
        <p>And then there was the call of Austin Gavin, as he bounced a black bag of toilet paper rolls on his hip: '' 'Let's Go Yankees' commemorative tissue on a roll! Show your pride.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gavin, a laborer for a commercial moving company, said he had seen a boy selling the same product at last year's Yankee parade. ''He was getting $4 a roll, and I'm selling two for $5. I've made about a hundred bucks so far.''</p>
        <p>Schoolchildren were everywhere, many young enough to believe that perhaps such celebrations are simply how New York greets every autumn. Some were with adult guardians, some were with other schoolchildren, and a few made the acquaintance of police officers.</p>
        <p>''I don't like it when someone's busting my shoes,'' an officer was saying as he escorted a backpack-toting boy away from the parade route. ''You want to get locked up?''</p>
        <p>At 10:30, two dozen sanitation workers bearing rakes and brooms marched from the shadows of Murray Street into the daylight gracing Broadway, where they received the crowd's enthusiastic approval. James Finnin, 28, was among this green-uniformed, white-gloved corps. His specific mission: rake Broadway from Murray to Warren Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finnin said his status as a Mets fan would not affect his job performance. ''They're a New York team,'' he said. ''And I think it's good for the city.''</p>
        <p>The city has not had the easiest of years. The acquittal in February of four white police officers in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black immigrant in the Bronx, divided the city. That fissure widened when police killed another unarmed black man, Patrick M. Dorismond, in Midtown in March. Then Mayor Giuliani, often criticized for exacerbating rather than easing the city's racial tensions, announced in May that he had prostate cancer, was separating from his wife and was stepping down from the race for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>All that seemed forgotten, temporarily at least, at 12:45, the moment that an antique Chrysler convertible rolled within view of those gathered near City Hall Park. Sitting high in its back seat was Yogi Berra, whose malapropisms tend to overshadow his extraordinary accomplishments as a star on Yankee dynasties past.</p>
        <p>A sound like the revving of airplane engines filled the air. Streams of white paper twisted and twirled, some cutting lazy, birdlike arcs in the sky. Mr. Berra's appearance, it seemed, had marked the true beginning of the parade.</p>
        <p>Then came the first float, with Mr. Giuliani standing at the front, near the golden World Series trophy. Wearing his Yankee warmup jacket, he jutted his forefingers at the crowd to signal No. 1, No. 1.</p>
        <p>Toward the back of the same float stood a less animated man, but the one who has guided the Yankees to their recent dominance: the manager, Joe Torre. He wore a brown leather coat, and simply waved in appreciation.</p>
        <p>There followed double-decker buses with various Yankee officials, a float with a huge rotating baseball, and some of the many high school marching bands from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. From Brooklyn there came the Jackie Robinson Center Steppers, dressed in their customary yellow and black and dancing in choreographed joy up the avenue.</p>
        <p>Then came another float, with Mariano Rivera, the devastatingly accurate relief pitcher, at the front, and Andy Pettitte, the baby-faced starting pitcher, at the back. Then another, with third baseman Scott Brosius, first baseman Tino Martinez and the crowd-pleasing shortstop Derek Jeter.</p>
        <p>''Derek Jeter saw me!'' said Mary O'Regan, a 15-year-old girl from Brooklyn whose face was painted blue and white with the Yankee logo. ''He saw me and he smiled. I'm so excited.''</p>
        <p>At times the parade included those who had as much to do with the Yankees as Mr. Gavin, the man selling rolls of toilet paper. Down the street in convertibles came that married acting couple, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick (a Mets fan); several stars from ''The Sopranos''; and Hugh L. Carey, the former New York governor, whom few seemed to recognize.</p>
        <p>Then there were those indirectly involved in securing the championship. One float was dedicated to those who work for ''scoreboard operations,'' another for the Yankee trainers. When yet another bus, carrying yet another load of people unknown to the crowd, rolled by, a spectator shouted, ''Who are you?''</p>
        <p>A guest on the float gave it back with proper New York inflection: ''Who are you?''</p>
        <p>Then the honored guests and their spouses joined Mayor Giuliani and 5,000 others for an invitation-only rally in front of City Hall, which was festooned with two-stories-high sheets depicting Yankee Stadium. Just as a parade up Broadway is a traditional response to a World Series championship, so too is this rally, which allows politicians to speak on behalf of the citizenry, all the while basking in the reflected glory of others.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki handed out mockups of license plates to be given to Derek Jeter (MVP) and Joe Torre (3-PEAT), while Mr. Giuliani elaborated on his contention last week that the parade would have educational value for students who skipped school to attend it. The lessons to be learned from this Yankee team, he said, included consistency, teamwork and the will to overcome adversity.</p>
        <p>Then he handed over keys of the city to any Yankee and anyone who looked like a Yankee; even the team masseuse received one.</p>
        <p>Sometime around 3:30, the end came for this raucous celebration of a glorious year in New York baseball. People hollered their last Yankee war cry, and disappeared down stairs leading to subways.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the Police and Fire Departments reported only a few incidents: 9 summonses for disorderly conduct, 168 summonses to unlicensed vendors and several small fires -- including one in which a police officer received minor burns while helping a child.</p>
        <p>This year, though, neither the Police Department nor the Giuliani administration would provide an estimate for the size of the crowd. In the past, the city has estimated that 3.5 million people have attended the parades, figures that others have said test credulity.</p>
        <p>The size, then, was left to the imagination, allowing who knows how many to someday say that Derek Jeter had gazed down from a float, smiled and waved to them.</p>
