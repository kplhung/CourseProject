        <p>The Kiss is back.</p>
        <p>All right, it never really went away. But more than two months after the televised smooch between Al and Tipper Gore at the Democratic National Convention that pumped a little blood into the vice president's pallid image, it suddenly seems that he can't get enough.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Mr. Gore planted multiple wet ones on Mrs. Gore at a rally in East Lansing, Mich., before they set off on a two-day bus tour of Michigan and Wisconsin. He did it again during a Fox News interview taped that evening.</p>
        <p>And later that night, he leaned in for another kiss in Muskegon, Mich., in front of 15,000 people who roared their approval. But after the first one, Mrs. Gore playfully pushed her amorous husband away.</p>
        <p>Like every spouse ever caught out, Mr. Gore tried to explain himself. Pointing into the audience, he said to his wife: ''Look at that sign now. It says, 'Let us see the kiss.' Are you embarrassed? Once is enough?''</p>
        <p>When the caravan stopped today in Chilton, Wis., there were more demands from the crowd for kisses. The vice president made as if to oblige, but Mrs. Gore, laughing, said, ''No, no.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, at least, Mr. Gore might have used the excuse of looking for a little warmth on a cold night, but he blew it, stripping off his suit coat and saying, ''I know it's chilly out here, but I'm feeling hot.''</p>
        <p>A Return to His Strong Suit</p>
        <p>The earth tones are gone.</p>
        <p>In a much-dissected makeover early this year, Mr. Gore adopted a just-folks set of casual clothes, mostly in earth tones, in one of many bids to loosen up. But in the last few weeks, in the campaign's final sprint, the vice president has ditched the taupes and khakis, even in settings that invite informality, in favor of the dark suits, white shirts and ties that used to be his public uniform.</p>
        <p>With his wardrobe switch, Mr. Gore today echoed (no doubt unintentionally) another era and another politician. Before delivering a speech this morning on the sandy shore of Lake Michigan in Muskegon, the vice president strode across the beach in a suit, along with Mrs. Gore. It was reminiscent of a photo opportunity staged for Richard M. Nixon, in which he strolled down a beach wearing a suit -- an image that crystallized Nixon's reputation for being perpetually ill at ease.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore should have been well aware of the Nixon parallel. Last month, on a beach in Florida, the vice president joked with two reporters and an aide about Nixon's beach walk. That day, he wore shorts and a polo shirt, and went barefoot.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, the campaign press secretary, said the change was nothing more than a bow to the cooler weather. When asked if Mr. Gore might be trying to look more presidential for the stretch run, Mr. Lehane said, ''I think you're looking too deeply into this.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Voters Notice</p>
        <p>After grinding along for months, the presidential race has reached that magic point when the public tunes in, and the crowds at campaign events mushroom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore drew 30,000 people last week to a rally in Madison, Wis. -- an extraordinary figure, by contemporary standards, for a small city -- more than 15,000 in Muskegon, and 11,000 tonight in Waukesha, Wis., according to the police in those cities. Last Thursday, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate, spoke to more than 5,000 people at a rally in Santa Fe, N.M. Gov. George W. Bush has also drawn larger audiences lately.</p>
        <p>Generations ago, before the diversions of the modern age and the instant information offered by television and the Internet, campaign rallies were a popular form of both entertainment and political information. Huge crowds were commonplace.</p>
        <p>Even as recently as the last hotly contested race, in 1992, Bill Clinton and Mr. Gore were speaking to large groups in midsummer, just after the Democratic convention. Whether the later appearance of big turnouts this year reflects the continuation of a long trend, or simply a lack of interest in this year's contest, is open to question.</p>
        <p>''I just couldn't get into it before now,'' said Mike Kuhn, one of the throng cheering for Mr. Gore today in Green Bay, Wis. ''But I'm glad I came.''</p>
