        <p>Capping a five-day state visit by President Fidel Castro, the governments of Cuba and Venezuela sealed a de facto economic and political alliance today, signing an agreement for Venezuela to supply one-third of Cuba's oil needs at cut-rate prices.</p>
        <p>Venezuela agreed to provide oil with a market value of $3 billion at current prices, delivering 53,000 barrels a day for five years. A barrel of crude has 42 gallons.</p>
        <p>Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves outside the Mideast, also agreed to grant Cuba cheap long-term credits and to accept a barter arrangement for repayment, greatly reducing the cost.</p>
        <p>The arrangement is a windfall for Cuba and its cash-starved economy, but a source of dispute among Venezuelans, many of whom say the country can ill afford to help others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castro has had to go to the open market for oil since the collapse of the Soviet Union voided a supply agreement at low prices. Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said this month that recent increases in oil prices had forced the government to budget an additional $500 million for imports this year.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Castro's visit, his first here in more than 40 years, both leaders spoke of the deepening relationship between the two countries.</p>
        <p>President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela said before the visit that ''we have no choice but to form an axis of power'' with Cuba and other like-minded countries that ''permits us to relate to the rest of the world.'' Mr. Chavez returned repeatedly to that theme after Mr. Castro's arrival.</p>
        <p>''This is not just a matter of friendship,'' Mr. Chavez, 46, a former army colonel who describes himself as a revolutionary, said on Sunday on his weekly radio program with Mr. Castro, 74, sitting at his side. ''It is a geopolitical vision of the integration of our peoples.''</p>
        <p>Today, he added, ''I think we have proven that our two peoples are one and the same.''</p>
        <p>The oil accord is virtually identical to one that Venezuela signed this month with 12 other Caribbean and Central America countries. They have been given 15 years to repay, with a 2 percent interest rate and prices as low as $20 a barrel, compared with the current price of just over $30. As with the other countries, Cuba will be allowed to repay Venezuela with a mixture of money, goods and services.</p>
        <p>A supplementary agreement signed today talks of Cuba, whose reserves of hard currency are limited, exporting vaccines and sugar technology to Venezuela, along with doctors and up to 3,000 physical education teachers and sports coaches and trainers, who might be unemployed if they remained in Cuba.</p>
        <p>Since the 1980's, Venezuela and Mexico have been partners in an arrangement that supplies oil at special prices to the small nations of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>But Latin American diplomats here said Mexico had rebuffed a Venezuelan initiative to let Cuba join the group, fearing that Cuba might not be able to pay.</p>
        <p>In addition, the diplomats said, Venezuela fears that the new conservative government of Vicente Fox that will take office on Dec. 1 in Mexico may be even less sympathetic to Mr. Castro. Those concerns, combined with Mr. Chavez's desire to use oil to make Venezuela a regional power, led to the initiatives.</p>
        <p>Venezuela is the third largest oil exporter. Its main customer is the United States, which buys 1.4 million barrels a day, or about half Venezuela's total production.</p>
        <p>In essence, the accord today lets Mr. Chavez use the increase in oil revenues earned in the United States to subsidize consumption in Cuba, a notion that is sure to appeal to and perhaps even amuse the anti-American faction in his inner circle.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel, a leader of that group, denied this month that there was any ''ideological character'' to the deal with Cuba. But he has also said, ''Petroleum has been a political weapon throughout history.''</p>
        <p>Apparently as proof of that, Venezuela has excluded neighboring Guyana, where it has a longstanding border dispute, from the regional pact.</p>
        <p>At a long news conference with Mr. Chavez this afternoon, Mr. Castro said, ''I came here not looking for fuel, though Venezuela has a lot of it, but seeking understanding and brotherhood.''</p>
        <p>He also attacked Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, whom he dismissed as ''little gentlemen'' of no substance.</p>
        <p>''I haven't the slightest interest in either of them,'' added Mr. Castro, who has been in power since 1959. ''I have lost count of how many presidents'' he has outlasted.</p>
        <p>''The only one who was decent and gentlemanly,'' he said, was Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez also took a few milder swipes at the United States. He said Colombia should resolve its civil conflict ''without foreign interference,'' apparently a reference to Washington's decision to send $1.3 billion in emergency aid to Bogota.</p>
        <p>There is no need, Mr. Chavez added, for the United States to be ''disturbed'' by a foreign policy that he said was aimed at helping in ''the necessary construction of a multipolar world.''</p>
        <p>''We are not in times of empire,'' Mr. Chavez also said, and no country should have to be ''dependent on hegemonic centers'' of power.</p>
        <p>He denounced the United States embargo on trade with Cuba and said the oil pact was ''positive for Venezuela from every point of view.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez's generosity has clearly had a domestic political cost, though. Many opposition parties, professional groups and unions have criticized the pact as a giveaway and argue that the money helping Cuba would be better spent on schools, sewers, hospitals, roads and wage increases for Venezuela's 24 million people.</p>
        <p>Teachers have been striking for higher pay, and doctors and sugar technicians have reacted negatively to the barter accord, saying Cuban assistance is not needed.</p>
        <p>''If there is money to give to Cuba, then there must also be money to give to the workers,'' Federico Ramirez Leon, president of the largest labor federation, said at a protest march here last week.</p>
