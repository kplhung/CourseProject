        <p>Wire fences are all that mark the border here between the United States and Mexico. Still, Juan Flores, a 31-year-old Mexican farmer tired of living on $5 a day, said that sneaking north would be anything but easy.</p>
        <p>The land, he said, is a death trap.</p>
        <p>Standing on the southern side of the fence recently, Mr. Flores stared out at the endless desert that stretched into Arizona. If all went well, he figured, it would take him two days to cross the rattlesnake haven and reach the nearest Arizona highway. Thanks to a few days of rain, the afternoon temperatures had dropped to a bearable 88 degrees, but at night, he worried, they could fall into the low 60's.</p>
        <p>To keep his load light, Mr. Flores carried only two apples, a bag of tortilla chips and a gallon jug of water. But after viewing the mountainous terrain ahead, he wondered whether he would have enough to drink. ''I am not worried that the migra will catch me,'' he said, using the migrants' word for the United States Border Patrol. ''I am worried that if I get lost the migra will not catch me.''</p>
        <p>Once as barren of people as it is of rainfall, the desert here is the one of the newest and fastest growing gateways to the United States for illegal Mexican immigrants. But it is also one of the most inhospitable regions of North America, known for fierce winter storms and 110-degree summer temperatures that turn the ground into a human grill. As the flow of immigrants here thickens, the area Mexicans call the Altar Desert has become a place of ultimate sacrifice.</p>
        <p>According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 369 immigrants have died trying to cross the border since last October. Some 100 of those deaths occurred along the Arizona-Mexico border, up from 19 deaths in 1998. A majority of the Sonora-Arizona deaths were caused by hypothermia, dehydration and drowning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flores, a stout man with the coarse and stubby fingers of someone who works the land, said he had heard dozens of stories about immigrants who had died from exposure to the heat and cold this year crossing the Altar Desert. He acknowledged that the journey ahead might seem foolhardy.</p>
        <p>But then he talked about the needs of his wife, and of their dreams for their three children, especially his newest son, born just two weeks earlier. He said he was determined to try. ''Of course I am scared,'' Mr. Flores said. ''But it's better to be scared and try to make a better life for my family than to stay and watch them go hungry.''</p>
        <p>Mexican government officials and human rights advocates say the soaring desert death toll is evidence of the failures, and some say cruelty, of recent United States border enforcement operations. Those operations have doubled the number of agents along the border, concentrating them in major urban areas like El Paso, San Diego, Brownsville and, most recently, the Arizona cities of Douglas and Nogales.</p>
        <p>But from Sasabe, population 3,000, it is clear that the increase in agents along the United States side of the border has not stopped immigrants from their illegal crossings. It has caused them to cut new channels through more perilous areas.</p>
        <p>''We cannot resolve the migration phenomenon with more agents,'' said Roberto Rodriguez Hernandez, the Mexican consul in Nogales, Ariz. ''We have to find more creative and imaginative ways; ways that address the need for workers in the United States and the lack of good opportunities in Mexico.''</p>
        <p>But he acknowledged that such solutions are a long way off. ''In the meantime,'' he said, ''we have been increasing our efforts to make immigrants safe.''</p>
        <p>Officials of Grupo Beta, a Mexican agency created several years ago to protect the rights and security of immigrants, carry rehydration kits and antivenom medicines in their vehicles for emergencies. They said they had rescued more than 1,000 immigrants this year. Specially trained units of the United States  Border Patrol have made close to 2,400 rescues.</p>
        <p>In the town of Altar, the last stop in civilization for most migrants headed into the Arizona desert, churches have begun offering them free meals and residents have opened boarding houses where they can get a bit of rest before moving on.</p>
        <p>It is a dust bowl of a town off the highway to Tijuana. The tallest building is the church, where an altar is decorated with banners that read, ''This is a place where migrants are recognized and treated as brothers.'' Surrounding the plaza are rows of  check-cashing counters and taco stands that have opened in the last few years to serve the migrants.</p>
        <p>Residents of Altar said the downtrodden strangers began passing through a few years ago, arriving in twos and threes. Today they come in busloads, from 300 to 800 each day. They fill the plaza and wait for paid guides, called coyotes, who promise them safe passage across the desert for fees ranging from $100 to $1,000.</p>
        <p>Many do not get their money's worth. Officials on both sides of the border say the coyotes often tell migrants that the journey takes hours, rather than days. And once paid, the coyotes often abandon those who run out of water and feel too weak to keep going.</p>
        <p>''We try to tell the people not to cross in the desert,'' said the Rev. Rene Luis Castaneda, the priest who serves the small ranching communities around Sasabe. ''They can make more money over there, but no amount of money is worth their lives.'' With a shrug, he added, ''Most  don't listen.''</p>
        <p>Librado, 50, a father of three who would not give his last name, said he had come to the desert from the lush, tropical state of Veracruz.</p>
        <p>''Everything looks the same,'' he said. ''I hope I will be able to tell whether I am walking forward and not backward.'' The landscape here looked to him like the surface of the full moon that shone above.</p>
        <p>And from where he stood, he said, the United States seemed just as far away. Turning to a new acquaintance before setting off on his journey, he sought some reassurance.</p>
        <p>''You think we will make it?''</p>
