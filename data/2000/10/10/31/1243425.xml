        <p>The Virginia Tech trainer is saying that Michael Vick, the country's most versatile quarterback, may be able to play against Miami on Saturday despite a sprained right ankle.</p>
        <p>Vick, who has been on crutches and wearing a soft cast since being injured in the first half against Pittsburgh last Saturday, did not disagree. But he said yesterday that if he is unable to practice, then he should not start.</p>
        <p>Vick, who hopes to test the ankle today, would defer to his backup, Dave Meyer. Coming off the bench, the fifth-year senior completed 7 of 13 passes for 114 yards in the Hokies' 37-34 comeback victory over Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>The Hokies, who improved to 8-0, are ranked third in the New York Times's computer ranking.</p>
        <p>''I think it's only right for Dave to start the football game if I don't practice,'' Vick said. ''I'd feel like I have to sit out at least a possession before I go in there. That's the way I feel about it.''</p>
        <p>After re-examining Vick's ankle Sunday, the Virginia Tech trainer Mike Goforth said, ''I feel pretty good about his chances.''</p>
        <p>In a national conference call yesterday, Vick did not sound so positive that he would be playing. As Meyer has noted, Vick, as a probable No. 1 overall pick in the National Football League draft, is sitting on a $50 million lottery ticket.</p>
        <p>Vick agreed that he must think beyond Saturday's game.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to go out there and be injuring my ankle any more and not be able to play the remainder of the season,'' he said. ''I have to be smart about this decision.''</p>
        <p>He also said he did not want to do anything to hurt the Hokies' chances against Miami (6-1), which is fifth in the Times's computer ranking.</p>
        <p>''This is a date I've had circled on my calendar for a long time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Regarding practice, he added: ''It makes me feel sad I can't be out there with my football team. It's added pressure to get back. But Dave is a great quarterback. We just have to trust him. I'm not worried.''</p>
        <p>Should he be unable to practice this week, Vick said he still might play.</p>
        <p>''The big thing is being mentally ready,'' he said. ''I can sit there and just throw the football and make moves when I have to. I think it would be a good game.''</p>
        <p>Miami Coach Butch Davis certainly believes that Vick will play Saturday. Davis feels that Florida State tried to snooker him before their game into believing that Chris Weinke would be out with a sprained ankle.</p>
        <p>Not only did Weinke play, but he passed for more than 400 yards.</p>
        <p>''If you think he's hurt, you're kidding yourselves,'' Davis said about Vick on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Davis also did his best to dispel the notion that Virginia Tech was doomed without Vick, pointing to the Pittsburgh comeback and saying, ''Let's not pretend this is a one-man team.''</p>
        <p>Vick, a sophomore left-hander, talked in an almost inaudibly low drone during much of his conference call yesterday. But his voice did rise when someone mentioned that Miami is favored in Saturday's game, even though visiting Virginia Tech has the higher national ranking.</p>
        <p>''That's something I don't understand,'' he said. ''That motivates me.''</p>
        <p>He also knows the type of no-holds-barred game these rivals usually play. Last year, when Virginia Tech won in blockbuster fashion, 43-10, Vick said:  ''I got scratched, punched, all kind of things like that. But that's what you can expect to happen in this type of football game.''</p>
        <p>Vick hopes to find out for himself again on Saturday.</p>
