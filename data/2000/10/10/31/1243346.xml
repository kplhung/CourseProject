        <p>Even after three decades of autobiographical plays by gay writers, Brian Belovitch's ''Boys Don't Wear Lipstick'' stands out for the elegance of its writing -- not to mention the disciplined good humor that Mr. Belovitch and his director, Keith Greer, have developed for his performance of this one-man show. The challenge was to develop a character of sufficient strength and allure to divert an audience from imposing its own imagination and emotions on this unusual story, and Mr. Belovitch as a character in his own history keeps an admirable control over us for an hour and a half.</p>
        <p>By now, at least among the downtown theater crowd, the outlines of the story are familiar. As a teenager in Providence, R.I., in the early  1970's Mr. Belovitch began medical treatments that turned him into a woman -- except for the surgical alteration of sex organs.</p>
        <p>He married a soldier and lived with him for five years at an army base in Germany before they broke up. Mr. Belovitch came to New York, where as Tish Gervais he had a career as a fashion model and then as a cabaret singer before a stint of Times Square prostitution. After 15 years as a woman, he had doctors reverse the transformation and, already in his 30's, for the first time as an adult became the man hidden inside him all along.</p>
        <p>In interviews Mr. Belovitch has told of many conflicts with his family, especially his father and some of his six siblings, during these years, and has sketched out many diverting details of his experiences. He first talked onstage about his life seven years ago in an East Village theater where a group of gay men tested the dramatic possibilities of their own life stories.</p>
        <p>During the years since he has developed this work in brief performances in several downtown houses, including the Charles Ludlam Theater. What finally appears in his Off Broadway run at the Players Theater in Greenwich Village is a striking demonstration that a dramatist's best instrument is a scalpel used often, with energy and determination.</p>
        <p>Gone are all the siblings, the father about whom Mr. Belovitch has deep feelings and all but a few of the known details of his grand adventure through the jungles of sexual identity. ''Boys Don't Wear Lipstick'' is not autobiography; it is a well-made play that one will not forget. What is left out is not lost; its emotional power is palpable, and it is much more eloquent in silence than if it had been given voice.</p>
        <p>To emphasize that the story is real, Elaine J. McCarthy, the projection designer, has chosen striking photographs and documents (especially the Rhode Island wedding certificate and Tish's professional modeling portfolio) from Mr. Belovitch's large collection to create a mute background commentary on the narrative that leaves the impression of a group of departed people looking in on Mr. Belovitch's act and on the audience watching it. They leave no doubt that Mr. Belovitch was the woman in the photos -- at the wedding, posing nude, laughing with her husband and friends.</p>
        <p>There must have been times of terrific emotional distress in Mr. Belovitch's female years; indeed, there is a telling allusion to a tranquilizer overdose. But the play is a comedy, a gentle one tempered by Mr. Belovitch's respect for the people of his past, including Tish and the man who struggled to emerge from her almost against his will. And there were certainly times of danger, especially in the years of prostitution; the story of Tish's escape from a carload of four  young men in Queens is funny but can raise the hair on the nape of the neck.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the canniest decision in making this play was never to let the audience see Mr. Belovitch as a man until the last minute onstage. Briefly, at the beginning, he is a teenager finding his way into drag, and then the stage is occupied by a comfortable, amusing and very smart woman enjoying an almost unimaginable life until, having sung lines from a richly suggestive torch song, in her dressing room she begins to try to suppress the man inside: ''I am going to kill you. You're lingering in the background watching me.'' Her threat is not serious, but she does yank open the door of a closet stuffed with glittering gowns and order him into it before she slams the door on him.</p>
        <p>She can't win. In the hospital to have her breast implants removed she asks the doctor, ''Did you ever have a dinner guest who stayed too long?'' Finally, at home, Mr. Belovitch slowly removes a winding bandage from his chest and stands before us in his baggy boxer shorts for a moment, silent, before he steps into a shower for a 10-second finale that is a moment of gentle, irresistible laughter. There is, of course, a little tinge of sadness for the audience, in the memory of the woman he left behind.</p>
