        <p>Gov. George W. Bush spent more money on television advertising in California last week than in any of the swing states, where he is believed to stand a better chance of winning on Election Day, a new study shows.</p>
        <p>The Republicans' advertising outlays in California, more than $1.8 million for the week that ended on Oct. 24, went unmatched by the Democrats. In fact, the report released yesterday by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law said that since June 1, Gov. George W. Bush and the Republican Party had spent $5.5 million on television commercials in California, the country's most populous state. The Democrats and Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, have spent no money on television there.</p>
        <p>California surveys show Mr. Gore leading, though the race appears to have narrowed somewhat over the last month. Still, political analysts say that the advertising offensive by Mr. Bush, which has been concentrated in Southern California, has so far not made the contest particularly competitive.</p>
        <p>''There's no evidence that the advertising has made any difference in the chance of Bush pulling an upset,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director of the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. ''Our latest poll showed the race had tightened, but even by our calculations we were unwilling to put California in the 'battleground state' category.''</p>
        <p>Recent polls give Mr. Gore a lead of between 5 and 10 percentage points.</p>
        <p>The Brennan Center, working with a University of Wisconsin professor, Ken Goldstein, has been tracking advertising spending in the nation's top 75 media markets. In the crucial third week of October, the researchers found, Mr. Bush and the Republican National Committee spent $9.1 million on television, while Mr. Gore, the Democratic National Committee and outside groups like Planned Parenthood spent $7.2 million. Virtually no money was spent on commercials for Mr. Bush by special-interest groups, which have been concentrating on supporting Republican congressional candidates.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush's largest expenditure was in California, Mr. Gore put more of his resources in Florida than in any other state. Even so, Mr. Bush outspent him there for the week, $1.5 million to about $1 million.</p>
        <p>Since June 1, Mr. Bush and the Republicans spent $65 million on television, and Mr. Gore, the Democrats and outside groups spent $61.6 million, the study said.</p>
        <p>The data also indicate that the 2000 presidential campaign is outstripping the 1996 race in sheer volume of advertising. Four years ago, viewers across the nation saw a total of 162,000 commercials, Mr. Goldstein said, adding that by Oct. 24 of this year, voters had already been exposed to 187,000 spots, evenly split between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Competitiveness equals high spending,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''There is a perfect correlation: the more ads aired, the more phone calls placed, the more money spent.''</p>
        <p>E. Joshua Rosenkranz, the Brennan Center's president, said the study further confirmed the expanding use of soft money, the unrestricted donations to the parties from corporations and wealthy individuals, to finance candidate advertising. Both the Democratic and Republican Parties, which can accept soft money, continue to outspend the Bush and Gore campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baldassare said he believed that the California advertising campaign might have been motivated partly by a desire to drive up Republican turnout in the Los Angeles area, where there are several close congressional races that could be decisive in the makeup of the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>But aides to Mr. Bush contend that the expenditures were intended to fulfill the campaign's promise to be a force in California. ''There was a commitment that we made to California early on, and that commitment was time and money,'' a top Bush adviser said. ''Plus, it's a 5- to 7-point race, so it's a good place for us to be.''</p>
