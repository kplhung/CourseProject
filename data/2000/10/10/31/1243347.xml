        <p>Everybody at the Metropolitan Opera involved with the annual gala pension fund benefit concert on late Sunday afternoon must have been terribly glad to have an extra hour to rehearse that day, thanks to daylight saving time. The program, with James Levine conducting the Met Orchestra, was to have featured the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli in her only appearance with the company this season, along with the bass-baritone Bryn Terfel.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bartoli, suffering from severe laryngitis, withdrew from the concert on Friday morning. The condition was caused, her press representative said, by air conditioning that blew directly on her during a concert the previous Sunday at Symphony Hall in Boston.</p>

        <p>Everybody at the Metropolitan Opera involved with the annual gala pension fund benefit concert on late Sunday afternoon must have been terribly glad to have an extra hour to rehearse that day, thanks to daylight saving time. The program, with James Levine conducting the Met Orchestra, was to have featured the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli in her only appearance with the company this season, along with the bass-baritone Bryn Terfel.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bartoli, suffering from severe laryngitis, withdrew from the concert on Friday morning. The condition was caused, her press representative said, by air conditioning that blew directly on her during a concert the previous Sunday at Symphony Hall in Boston.</p>
        <p>Olga Borodina, currently singing Carmen with the Met, agreed to take her place, and a new program was worked out with Mr. Terfel and Mr. Levine on Saturday. But on Sunday morning Ms. Borodina woke up with no voice, said Joseph Volpe, the general manager, who delivered the bad news from the stage before the 5 p.m. concert began.</p>
        <p>The show went on thanks to three Met stalwarts: the sopranos Cristina Gallardo-Domas and Sondra Radvanovsky, who had just sung, respectively, Mimi and Musetta in Saturday night's performance of ''La Boheme,'' and the tenor Richard Margison, who has been appearing in ''Turandot.'' But the program had to be reconfigured yet again on Sunday, which is why that extra hour must have come in handy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Terfel, looking and sounding healthy as could be, performed only two of the works he had originally planned: Iago's ''Credo'' from Verdi's ''Otello,'' which he sang chillingly, and Don Magnifico's aria from Rossini's ''Cenerentola,'' which he sang stylishly. He also offered some familiar works that he, Mr. Levine and the intrepid orchestra musicians had pulled together just hours before, including Leporello's ''Catalog'' Aria from ''Don Giovanni,'' ''Mephistopheles's Waltz'' from ''Faust,'' Wolfram's ''Song to the Evening Star'' from ''Tannhauser'' and Falstaff's soliloquy about honor from ''Falstaff.''</p>
        <p>He and Mr. Margison offered a stirring account of the famous duet from Bizet's ''Pearl Fishers.'' Mr. Margison sounded radiant in ''Nessun dorma'' from ''Turandot,'' and Ms. Gallardo-Domas sang affectingly in ''Signore, ascolta!'' from that opera.</p>
        <p>Ms. Radvanovsky performed ''D'amor sull'ali rosee'' and the subsequent ''Miserere'' scene from Verdi's ''Trovatore,'' in which she will appear in late December. Throw in standbys like the ''Va, pensiero'' chorus from Verdi's ''Nabucco,'' Puccini's ''O mio babbino caro'' (Ms. Gallardo-Domas), and four overtures, including the Prelude to ''Die Meistersinger,'' plus a couple of encores by Mr. Terfel, including ''Some Enchanted Evening,'' and you had a pretty full program. The audience seemed to accept the changes with good will.</p>
