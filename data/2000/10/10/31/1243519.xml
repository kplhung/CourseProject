        <p>Jim Fassel knows his Giants are not the only 6-2 football team in town. He also knows his Giants have ascended to this midseason perch quietly, while the 6-2 Jets have been the high-wire attraction, forever a step from disaster or distinction.</p>
        <p>Today at Giants Stadium, Fassel said he did not care about perceptions or publicity. But this being the year of the Subway Series, in his own understated way, the Giants coach delivered a crosstown message.</p>
        <p>''We're 6-2, and that puts us near the front of the class,'' Fassel said. ''We could go play with most people who have that record. We're a blue- collar, lunch-pail team. If people want to leave us in the background, we'll just keep going about our business. I'd rather make a whole lot of noise later than beat your own drum now.''</p>
        <p>But after Washington's 27-21 loss to Tennessee tonight, the Giants are in sole possession of first place in the National Football Conference East.</p>
        <p>The Jets, who lost to Buffalo on Sunday, are not the only other 6-2 team in the National Football League, but they are a natural point of comparison. And -- with the urging of reporters -- they became a popular topic for Fassel today.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy for the Jets,'' said Fassel, whose Giants won their third consecutive game Sunday with a 24-7 dismantling of Philadelphia. ''The fashion that they've won games creates attention. I understand that. But you're measured on your record and I've told our guys, that for the most part, we'll write the story of the season with how we play.''</p>
        <p>And Fassel likes the way the Giants have been playing. He wants to score more points, but he does not feel the need to apologize for his team's methodical efforts.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes when I hear people talk about our games, I want to say: 'Jeez, we did win the game,' '' Fassel said. ''We've been in control of the games we've won. We've played much like we've wanted to play. Sometimes when you're winning, you don't have big passing numbers. That's just the way it is.</p>
        <p>''There's a process, and we have to build through it. Running the football is the foundation. The passing gets the points. We have to do one, then the other. And running the football helps with the passing game, it controls the clock, rests the defense and gets us physically into the game.''</p>
        <p>Sunday, the Giants were actually fairly balanced, running the ball 44 times and attempting to pass 40 times. Led by the rookie Ron Dayne's 93 rushing yards, they gained 152 yards on the ground. But quarterback Kerry Collins had 232 passing yards throwing to six different players.</p>
        <p>The Giants reversed Fassel's stated offensive formula early, with 9 pass plays in their first 12 plays from scrimmage. As the game wore on, it was the pass that set up the run as Dayne had 20 second-half rushing carries. Most of all, the Giants offense succeeded because Collins was rarely under pressure in the pocket and the offensive line opened holes for Dayne and Tiki Barber. Left tackle Lomas Brown had an especially good game, limiting the effectiveness of Philadelphia's defensive end Hugh Douglas, who came into the game leading the league in sacks.</p>
        <p>Defensively, the Giants pressured Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb and sacked him four times. By holding the Philadelphia ground game to 72 yards, they also made the Eagles' offense one dimensional.</p>
        <p>Today, Fassel could not have seemed more at ease and content. He could even joke about the league's instant-replay challenge system. Fassel had been 0 for 7 in such challenges, but he finally got the officials to agree with him on one Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I knew I was absolutely right,'' Fassel said of the 9-yard reception caught by Philadelphia's Charles Johnson that was eventually ruled out of bounds. ''If I hadn't gotten that one reversed, I tell you I don't know what I would have done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fassel gave his players today off, a policy he has adopted after victories in the last month. Asked how many Mondays he expected his players to have off the rest of the season, Fassel answered, ''As far as I'm concerned, I'd like to have eight more of them off.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach JIM FASSEL said he did not think his players would look past Sunday's opponent, the Cleveland Browns (2-7), and begin to think about the Giants' home game against the St. Louis Rams on Nov. 12.</p>
        <p>''Our team realizes the seriousness of all of it,'' Fassel said. ''I'm not going to let them think any less.''</p>
        <p>Fassel said that cornerback JASON SEHORN (cracked rib) might do some light practicing this week. Sehorn will not play this weekend. Fassel said that several players had minor injuries but none that should affect his starting lineup Sunday.</p>
