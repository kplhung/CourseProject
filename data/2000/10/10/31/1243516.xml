        <p>MANHATTAN: HOMELESS WOMAN DIES  The authorities were trying to identify a homeless woman who was found dead on a Manhattan street corner, the police said yesterday. The woman, thought to be in her 40's, was found at 9:15 a.m. yesterday at East 13th Street and Avenue B after a cold night. She was pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of her death could not immediately be determined. An autopsy is set for today, said a spokeswoman for the medical examiner.</p>

        <p>BALDWIN HARBOR: NURSE SHOT IN HEAD  A 56-year-old nurse was shot in the head and wounded outside her house by two masked men at 5:15 a.m. yesterday in what the Nassau County police said appeared to be an attempted contract killing. The woman, Eliette Dominique, was in stable condition at South Nassau Community Hospital. No arrests have been made, the police said. Last year, the woman's husband was killed in a hit-and-run incident. It was later learned that he had another wife, in Newark, said Detective Sgt. Richard Laursen of the Nassau County police. The man's estate is being contested by his two widows. The police were investigating whether those events were connected to yesterday's shooting, Sergeant Laursen said.  Andy Newman (NYT)</p>

        <p>WHITE PLAINS: PAMPHLET COMPLAINT  Local officials are concerned about the growing number of bias pamphlets that have been distributed in Westchester County. Over the weekend, residents in Pleasantville and Chappaqua complained that pamphlets attacking blacks, Jews and Hispanics were left on their properties. The pamphlet is from the World Church of the Creator, an Illinois group headed by Matt Hale, above. It has also been found in Tarrytown, Croton-on-Hudson and Sleepy Hollow. The Westchester district attorney's office is investigating, but says the First Amendment may protect such literature.</p>

        <p>WEST BABYLON: FRACAS AT LAZIO RALLY  The Conservative Party candidate for Representative Rick A. Lazio's seat said he was shoved and his 3-year-old son punched by a supporter of his Republican opponent. The Conservative candidate, Rich Thompson, said that at a rally Saturday for Mr. Lazio's Senate campaign, a supporter of Joan Johnson, his Republican opponent, hit him with a campaign sign. Mr. Thompson said that the supporter also tried to punch him in the face but hit Stadtler, Mr. Thompson's son. The child was not seriously injured. A spokesman for Ms. Johnson's campaign said it was an accident, and the police have closed the case.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: KISSINGER RELEASED  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was released from a hospital yesterday after suffering a heart attack last week. Mr. Kissinger, 77, the secretary of state during the Nixon and Ford administrations, entered New York Weill Cornell Center last Wednesday after suffering what a hospital spokeswoman called ''a limited heart attack.'' He underwent bypass surgery in 1982.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: OFFICER CONVICTED  A federal jury convicted Officer Salvatore Gallo of the Hartford Police Department on Friday on charges that while on duty, he forced a prostitute to have sex with him in his police cruiser twice between September 1996 and February 1997. The woman, in testimony before a Federal District Court jury in Hartford, said Officer Gallo threatened to arrest her if she refused, according to the United States attorney in Connecticut, Stephen C. Robinson. Mr. Gallo is the sixth current or former Hartford officer to be convicted in the investigation of civil rights violations of local prostitutes.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: INDIAN RECOGNITION SOUGHT  An Indian group calling itself the Western Pequot Tribal Nation of New Haven is forming to apply for federal recognition and is considering land claims, possibly in Guilford and Old Saybrook. The group wants to create a reservation, but is not interested in building a casino, said its leader, Samuel E. Thomas. Mr. Thomas said he and other organizers were among a larger group of Pequot and Narragansett descendants who sought to join the Mashantucket Pequot tribe but were rejected.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: FEDERAL ROLE URGED IN TROOPER CASE  The Black Ministers Council of New Jersey said yesterday that it had asked Attorney General Janet Reno to take over the prosecution of two state troopers who shot and wounded three unarmed minority men in 1998. The council said it doubted the state's ability to prosecute the troopers, John Hogan and James Kenna, after a recent disclosure that the New Jersey attorney general's office knew about racial profiling by the state police as early as 1997.</p>

        <p>BOUND BROOK: $300 MILLION DAM PROJECT  After years of planning punctuated by protests from environmentalists, the Army Corps of Engineers broke ground yesterday on the first phase of the Green Brook Flood Control project, a series of dams and levies expected to cost $300 million. The $4.2 million first phase will include a temporary bridge across the brook linking Bound Brook and Middlesex Boroughs. Proponents favor the project because eight people have died in floods since 1971. Environmentalists have voiced concerns about possible harm to the stream bed and wildlife.</p>

        <p>IRVINGTON: PROSTITUTION ARRESTS  State police raided a bar that they said promoted teenage prostitution. The owner of Crystals Club X-Ray, Guiseppe Nicastro, 52, was arrested Friday night on charges including promoting prostitution and endangering the welfare of a minor. The state police said 33 people were arrested, including 5 girls ages 15 to 18 on charges of prostitution.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: TOUCH-TONE PHONE CHARGE  A bill approved yesterday would cut a monthly surcharge on phone bills. Since 1985, telephone companies have charged customers a fee for having touch-tone telephones. Lawmakers estimate that six million residential and business phone lines were being assessed the fee, which was supposed to help telephone companies recoup costs associated with installing the once state-of-the-art telephones. The bill now goes to the State Senate.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>TRENTON: ANTI-GAMBLING BILL ADVANCES  A plan to let compulsive gamblers ban themselves from casinos moved a step closer to being enacted yesterday when the State Assembly approved it. The bill would allow problem gamblers to register with the state and provide a photograph of themselves, which casinos would use to identify them. They would be denied access to slot machines, table games, credit, complimentary items and other benefits.</p>
