        <p>Minutes before the Buccaneers met the Vikings on Sunday, Tampa Bay wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson found Minnesota cornerback Robert Tate. Johnson got right in Tate's face and without hesitation said, ''I'm going to hurt you today.''</p>

        <p>Minutes before the Buccaneers met the Vikings on Sunday, Tampa Bay wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson found Minnesota cornerback Robert Tate. Johnson got right in Tate's face and without hesitation said, ''I'm going to hurt you today.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the week, Tate remarked that Johnson was just another wide receiver. Johnson read Tate's comments and used them to add spice to a contest that already promised fireworks. Of course, Johnson did not mean he was going to hurt Tate literally, just figuratively, and he did, beating up Tate and his secondary buddies for 121 yards and a touchdown on 6 catches.</p>
        <p>Ouch. That hurts.</p>
        <p>But it was a conversation that Johnson had earlier in the week with his teammate Shaun King that was more instrumental in Tampa Bay's 41-13 victory.</p>
        <p>Johnson bashers will hate to read this, but it was the fiery Johnson who was the impetus behind the victory over the previously undefeated Vikings (7-1), and it appears, finally, that his mix of outstanding talent and brazen personality is mixing well with the Buccaneers players and coaches.</p>
        <p>The Buccaneers' re-emergence as a playoff team began on a Wednesday night. Johnson was driving home from practice and was unhappy about his role in the offense, which he had been for weeks. But instead of seething inside, he called King, his starting quarterback, at home and asked if he was busy. King said he had some friends over and they were going to watch the World Series. Johnson said he was on his way.</p>
        <p>King sent his buddies home.</p>
        <p>Johnson arrived at King's house, and the two simply talked while drinking some cranberry juice, the Subway Series playing softly in the background on the television. They talked and talked and talked, and the main theme was Johnson lobbying for the football for him and running back Warrick Dunn.</p>
        <p>''We spent about four hours together,'' Johnson said. ''I was just trying to give him an understanding of what I came here to do and what I can do offensively for this team.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''It was the first time all year long that I lobbied for the ball with the quarterback. I told him, just hold onto the ball and as soon as you get an opportunity throw it, because chances are one of two things are going to happen. I'm either going to catch the football or we're going to get the interference call.''</p>
        <p>The only thing that can stop Johnson is a conservative game plan or a broken leg. The Buccaneers (4-4) realize this now, and the National Football League's top teams had better keep an eye on the rearview mirror because Johnson and his buddies are back.</p>
        <p>Johnson's lobbying for the football is about as new a phenomenon as the pet rock. But this time, something happened, and that is where the Buccaneers' story takes another interesting twist.</p>
        <p>King bought into Johnson's speech, and he relayed that belief up Tampa Bay's chain of command, from the offensive coordinator Les Steckel, to the team's open-minded head coach, Tony Dungy. ''You talk to him and you just start to understand what kind of competitor he is,'' King said of Johnson.</p>
        <p>What is not generally known is that the coaching staff not only made sure Johnson got more passes thrown his way, but also that the team drastically simplified the offense for the Minnesota game, eliminating things like excessive presnap motion.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay basically ran the same 10 to 12 plays the entire game, simply disguising them by running the plays out of different formations as a disguise. On one play, Johnson might be the sole receiver on the right, with two wideouts on the left. On the next snap, Johnson might be on the left, with the other two wide receivers on the right, but the play would be identical to the one before.</p>
        <p>The formula -- Johnson's increased involvement, the simplifying of the offense, the talk between Johnson and King, and the usual hard-core defense -- proved a dangerous mix to the Vikings.</p>
        <p>It is only one game, but Tampa Bay will continue to use this formula. The Buccaneers' next five games are against Atlanta, Green Bay, Chicago, Buffalo and Dallas. Those are all very winnable.</p>
        <p>If Tampa Bay goes on a streak and eventually makes the playoffs, the Buccaneers will point to Johnson and King, talking in King's house, figuring out a way to wake up a sleeping offense, as one of the pivotal moments of the season.</p>
        <p>''Things had been bothering me for probably four weeks since we lost to the New York Jets . . . about getting me more heavily involved in the offense and utilizing me,'' Johnson said. ''I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't wait any more. I just basically told Shaun, let's figure a way out of this and move in the right direction. Then people won't be judging you, and people won't be judging me.''</p>
