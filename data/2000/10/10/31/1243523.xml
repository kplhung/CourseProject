        <p>As thousands of people poured into Lower Manhattan for the parade, a smaller group weaved past the fans and barricades to enter the Shrine of Elizabeth Ann Seton for the 12:15 Mass.</p>
        <p>The Roman Catholic church, a red-brick building on State Street, sits across from Battery Park, where the marchers and floats assembled, and amid the towers of the city's financial district. The church dates to 1883, when it was established as a home for immigrant girls with nowhere else to go. It takes its name from the first American-born Catholic saint.</p>
        <p>On Monday, as the parade pounded along with drumbeats and confetti, the Mass unfolded quietly inside. The Rev. Joe O'Meara lectured from the Gospel of St. Paul on the sins of lust and fornication.</p>
        <p>''Let us go in peace to love and serve the Lord,'' Father O'Meara told the congregants.</p>
        <p>They may have gone in peace, but they certainly didn't go into peace. When the front door swung open, the whir of helicopters and the cheers of fans seeped inside. Paradegoers sat on the front stoop and a squadron of street cleaners sat ready on the curb. The 30 people who came to worship -- many of them professionals who work nearby -- looked on the festivities that engulfed their church with mild bemusement.</p>
        <p>''I've think I've seen enough of this on TV,'' said Fred Brennan, who manages a pool of clerical workers for the Depository Trust Company. ''Doesn't this city have something better to spend its money on? What are there, a half-million kids playing hooky today?''</p>
