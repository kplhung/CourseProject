        <p>Primedia to Buy About.com For $690 Million in Stock  Primedia, the magazine conglomerate controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, agreed to buy About.com, one of New York City's largest Internet companies, for $690 million in stock.</p>
        <p>The companies serve a sprawling and eclectic list of specialized interests. Primedia has a few big titles, including New York and Seventeen, but it has largely collected about 100 consumer fan magazines. About, formed in 1996 as the Mining Company, is a Web guide created by independent, mostly part-time guides who earn a share of the site's advertising. It now comprises more than 700 sites on topics from astrology to woodworking. [Page C14.]</p>
        <p>Have Strong Dollars, Will Travel  The strong United States economy is driving a vast holiday migration to Europe, helped by the dollar's rise against the euro, which has shrunk the costs of shopping, accommodations and dining for traveling Americans. [A1.]</p>
        <p>PepsiCo to Acquire 90% of SoBe  PepsiCo agreed to buy a 90 percent stake in South Beach Beverage for $370 million in cash, beating its archrival Coca-Cola again in one of the most dynamic segments of the beverage industry. Sales of SoBe's herb-laden ''elixirs'' with names like Edge, Power and Tsunami have jumped to $225 million this year from $1.2 million in 1996. Shares of PepsiCo rose $1.13, to $49.25. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Dow Gains 2.3% as Nasdaq Slides  The Dow Jones industrial average registered its biggest one-day gain in six months as investors put money into blue-chip issues and sold technology shares. The Dow rose 245.15 points, or 2.3 percent, to 10,835.77. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also moved higher, rising 19.08 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,398.66. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 86.96 points, or 2.7 percent, to 3,191.40. [C18.]</p>
        <p>Smirnoff Seeks to Improve Image  The 12-member global marketing team for Smirnoff vodka is moving to Stamford, Conn., from London as part of an effort to improve the brand's image in the United States. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Microsoft Tries to Prevent Filings  Microsoft asked a federal appeals court to forbid nine organizations and individuals who support the government antitrust suit against the company, including America Online, to file court briefs in the case. Alternatively, Microsoft said all nine should be asked to combine their thoughts into one 25-page brief. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Share Sale in Sky Global Delayed  The News Corporation, which had been planning to sell part of its global satellite businesses, Sky Global Networks, to the public next month, has postponed the sale because of market conditions, a person close to the company said. Despite the delay, News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, is in talks with Microsoft about selling a nearly $1 billion stake in Sky Global, which would give Microsoft 3.5 percent of the company. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Auction Settlement Details Payouts  A $512 million formal settlement of the class-action lawsuit against Sotheby's and Christie's lays out for the first time how the proceeds are to be divided among the plaintiffs, according to Sotheby's court papers. [C17.]</p>
        <p>Verizon Posts Flat Quarterly Profit  Verizon's third-quarter profit was almost unchanged as it spent more on services like long distance and high-speed Internet access. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Spending and Incomes Show Gains  Spending by consumers surged 0.8 percent in September, the Commerce Department reported, and an election-year package of farm aid pushed up incomes 1.1 percent. [C16.]</p>
