        <p>Alex Rodriguez and 32 other players filed for free agency yesterday. Forget the other 32. Rodriguez is the player whose availability will command the most attention this off-season.</p>
        <p>Not many clubs will pursue the erstwhile Seattle shortstop because of the cost of signing him, but one of those that do will make him the highest-paid player in baseball history. The figure of $20 million has been mentioned so routinely as a likely annual salary that everyone simply assumes that is what Rodriguez will get. But it would not be surprising if he exceeds even that amount.</p>
        <p>''I just spent five days with Alex going through what his goals were, what he wanted to accomplish in this process,'' Scott Boras, his agent, said yesterday. ''He gave me specific directions on how he wants to see this handled. We're going to narrow the number of places we visit.''</p>
        <p>The Mets are expected to pursue the remarkably talented shortstop most aggressively. They and any other team can immediately speak to Boras about their interest, but no one besides the Mariners can sign Rodriguez until Nov. 11, after the 15-day filing period has concluded.</p>
        <p>''This will be a complex contract in structure and in compensation,'' Boras said in a telephone interview, ''because we're dealing with something we've never dealt with before in baseball. There's been no shortstop at the age of 24 who has remotely done what Alex has done in the history of the game. He is the best player at his position in history at this age.''</p>
        <p>Rodriguez, who turned 25 this past July, already is fourth on the career list for home runs by a shortstop, with 189. He has hit 41 or 42 in each of the past three seasons, joining Ernie Banks as the only shortstop to hit 40 more than once. When he hit his 150th home run against Andy Pettitte of the Yankees this past April 7, he tied Mickey Mantle as the fourth fastest to reach that plateau.</p>
        <p>With Ken Griffey Jr. traded to Cincinnati, Rodriguez led the Mariners to the American League Championship Series, finishing among the top 10 in home runs, runs batted in, runs scored, total bases, extra-base hits, walks, on-base percentage and slugging percentage.</p>
        <p>''We have to get to know who this player is and what he means to a franchise,'' Boras said. ''Once we do that, there have to be provisions or elements in the contract that have never been discussed before in baseball. All the major free-agent contracts I've done the players have been in their 30's. To be fair to everyone, we have to have a different approach to this.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners have tried to re-sign Rodriguez and will continue that effort, but it would be surprising if they succeeded.</p>
        <p>Manny Ramirez is the other everyday free agent who will command a huge contract. He is virtually certain to exceed the $17 million a year the Toronto Blue Jays gave Carlos Delgado last week.</p>
        <p>Jeff Moorad, the outfielder's agent, said he spoke with John Hart, the Cleveland general manager, yesterday in a continuing effort to work out a deal for Ramirez to remain with the Indians.</p>
        <p>''We talked about the possibility of submitting a proposal to the Indians before the end of the 15-day period so they could understand a little better our view of the market,'' Moorad said. This past July the Indians offered $75 million for five years, but the package included deferred payments, and Moorad said ''deferrals are not something we're looking for here.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are definitely interested in Ramirez, and the Mets could be a suitor, too.</p>
        <p>Among the other players who filed yesterday were two members of the Yankees, Luis Polonia, whose name was submitted while he was participating in the parade, and Roberto Kelly, who was injured most of the season.</p>
        <p>Ellis Burks of San Francisco, Andres Galarraga of Atlanta, David Segui of Cleveland, and Darren Dreifort and Ismael Valdes, two Los Angeles pitchers, also became free agents.</p>
