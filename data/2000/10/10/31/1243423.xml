        <p>Those who live amid the horse farms and fast-spreading subdivisions of central New Jersey could be forgiven for not knowing who represents them in the House of Representatives. Since 1996, voters in the 12th Congressional District have had to remember the names of three different men working on their behalf in Washington.</p>
        <p>''I know he's got a funny name,'' said Rita Shulman, 47, as she stood outside the ShopRite supermarket on Route 18 here trying to conjure up an image of her congressman. ''He's a Republican, right?'' Well, not quite.</p>

        <p>Those who live amid the horse farms and fast-spreading subdivisions of central New Jersey could be forgiven for not knowing who represents them in the House of Representatives. Since 1996, voters in the 12th Congressional District have had to remember the names of three different men working on their behalf in Washington.</p>
        <p>''I know he's got a funny name,'' said Rita Shulman, 47, as she stood outside the ShopRite supermarket on Route 18 here trying to conjure up an image of her congressman. ''He's a Republican, right?'' Well, not quite.</p>
        <p>Rush Holt, 52, the freshman incumbent and a Democrat, may have an unusual name, but it has not been much help in this incongruous collection of squat office parks, look-alike ranch houses and new-money estates. Even a recent poll commissioned by Mr. Holt, a physicist from Hopewell Township, found that more than half the voters here had no idea who did their bidding in the House.</p>
        <p>At least 10 percent of those questioned uttered the names of the former incumbents, Mike Pappas, a conservative Republican ousted by Mr. Holt in 1998, and Richard A. Zimmer, a moderate Republican who gave up the seat two years before that for an unsuccessful Senate run against Robert G. Torricelli. ''I don't think many voters could ID either guy in a lineup,'' said Prof. David P. Rebovich, who teaches political science at Rider University in Lawrenceville.</p>
        <p>While such findings frustrate Mr. Holt, they bring comfort to Mr. Zimmer, 56, a Hunterdon County lawyer who is waging a high-stakes battle to regain his former seat, one that both parties are calling one of the most crucial and hotly contested in the nation. ''Obviously, people remember what I did when I was their representative in Congress,'' he said in a recent interview. ''It's very heartening.''</p>
        <p>Even more worrisome for Mr. Holt is that several polls show the race as neck and neck. Mr. Holt's appearance of vulnerability has helped to fuel intense interest from Republican Party leaders in Washington, who see the race as one that could ensure that the Republicans retain  power in Congress.</p>
        <p>Republicans currently hold a six-seat advantage in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>''Less than 24 hours after I was elected, the Republicans painted a bull's-eye on my back,'' Mr. Holt said recently as he drove through the bucolic western fringe of his district. ''They, and Mr. Zimmer, want this seat badly.''</p>
        <p>The National Republican Congressional Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have both spent heavily on both races, paying for a welter of mailings and television ads that have become increasingly strident. Although neither group has disclosed its soft-money spending, the candidates have each raised close to $2 million in a race that already ranks as one of the country's most expensive Congressional contests.</p>
        <p>''This is our best shot for taking out a Democratic incumbent,'' said Marit Babin, a spokeswoman for the Congressional Republican group. ''Rush Holt won this race in a fluke. We think he's extremely weak and in a heap of trouble.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt's 1998 victory over Mr. Pappas was something of a stunner. Many people felt that Mr. Holt toppled his opponent by repeatedly broadcasting an aria Mr. Pappas sang on the House floor that praised Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. Many voters, fed up with the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, directed their disgust at Mr. Pappas, giving Mr. Holt, the son of a New Deal-era senator from West Virginia, his first job in elective office.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Pappas also tried to win back the seat this summer, losing a primary to Mr. Zimmer, may have further confused some voters. Then there are Mr. Zimmer's ads, which refer to him as ''a special congressman'' in the present tense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt's re-election bid is further complicated by the Green Party candidate, Carl J. Mayer, 41, a lawyer from Princeton who could siphon away some votes. Mr. Mayer, who showed up at two recent candidates' forums asking to participate, was rebuffed by Mr. Holt.</p>
        <p>With 700,000 residents, 75,000 more than a decade ago, the 12th District is  difficult to categorize. More than half the voters are registered as independents, with the rest evenly divided between the two major parties. Although people here tend to elect Republicans, they have also voted to put plenty of Democrats in office, among them Mr. Holt, and in 1996, President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Its residents are affluent and well educated, with nearly two-thirds of adults having college degrees. The district, which includes communities like Freehold and Princeton, has no major cities. Poverty, crime and urban blight are not burning concerns.</p>
        <p>''It's a very suburban, tweedy-sports-coat kind of place,'' said Ingrid W. Reed, director of the Eagleton Institute's New Jersey Project, which is part of Rutgers University. ''Fighting sprawl is probably the one thing they have in common.''</p>
        <p>For the candidates, the challenges are formidable. Many recently arrived residents have little awareness of local politics, and no television stations or daily newspapers reach the entire district, which stretches from the Delaware River to the Atlantic Ocean. ''As far as the New York and Philadelphia stations are concerned, these guys are basically invisible,'' Ms. Reed said of the lack of television coverage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt has repeatedly cited Mr. Zimmer's Congressional voting record in an attempt to portray him as a Newt Gingrich loyalist. Although Mr. Zimmer largely supports abortion rights and gun control legislation, Mr. Holt depicts him as a cynical conservative out of touch with the moderate values of the district. ''He's trying to sound like Rush Holt on issue after issue, but he can't hide from his record,'' Mr. Holt said.</p>
        <p>When he is not rebutting and condemning his opponent's attacks, Mr. Zimmer tells voters about his accomplishments in Congress, including his reputation as a tax cutter and his role in passing a federal measure informally known as Megan's Law that requires communities to be notified when a sex offender is released into their midst.</p>
        <p>Both candidates, who are rumpled former college professors immersed in policy details, seem to reflect the prevailing texture and spirit of this district, which includes Princeton University and Rider University.</p>
        <p>But despite their similar styles, they have divergent, deeply held views on the role of government in society, something that Professor Rebovich says is often overshadowed by the vituperative give-and-take of the campaign. ''Holt is committed to an activist government,'' he said, ''whereas Zimmer remains more committed to a conservative ideology'' on taxes and spending.</p>
        <p>During a forum at an East Brunswick catering hall this week, Mr. Holt told an audience of retirees that Mr. Zimmer would hurt older Americans by siding with insurance companies and H.M.O.'s. His opponent, he said, believes that ''all this country really needs is a good tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, and that Head Start, Medicare and environmental protection are just failed policies of a bloated government.''</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Holt's more provocative attacks have sparked criticism  from newspapers. An advertisement on a cable television station asserting that Mr. Zimmer never voted for any education-financing bills was removed and modified by the Democratic Congressional organization after Mr. Zimmer convinced the station it was inaccurate. The Trentonian criticized the ad in an editorial with the headline ''Liars for Holt.''</p>
        <p>Even more notable was a campaign brochure that condemned Mr. Zimmer for voting to deny expanded mammogram coverage to older women. Mr. Zimmer, who says the item was part of a broader Medicare spending bill he voted against, called the ad cruel, and held a news conference with his sister, a breast cancer survivor, to drive home the point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt defends the ads, saying that they simply illustrated Mr. Zimmer's record.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmer was widely criticized for waging a negative campaign during his failed Senate race against Mr. Torricelli. But Mr. Zimmer said he had been chastened by the experience. ''I learned that I didn't like the tone of the campaign and I didn't want 2000 to be a reprise of that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mark Matzen, Mr. Holt's campaign manager, said he did not have much faith in such sentiments, and that he expected a last-minute flurry of negative ads. ''Dick Zimmer's consultants have a tendency to do something nasty in the last five or six days,'' he said. ''As far as we're concerned, anything can happen.''</p>
