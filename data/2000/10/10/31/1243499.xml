        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Gauging the Rain'' Q &amp; A (Oct. 17): The column is accompanied by an interesting figure: a weird-looking woman with an umbrella (A psychic? Maybe a scientist?) gauging the rain by counting the drops. The fact is that this is not as strange as it seems. Anyone who has ever heard rain ticking on an umbrella or watched rain splashing knows well that it is not a continuous process (like a waterfall), but a discrete process consisting of individual raindrops that occur in varying numbers and have different positions, sizes and speeds.</p>
        <p>The discrete nature of rainfall has long been overlooked by weather experts. But the now readily available rainfall data obtained using ground-based and space-borne weather radar have stimulated renewed interest. The instruments now used to study the nature of rainfall are far more sophisticated: they reveal a new order in the seemingly chaotic structure of rainfall, helping us develop methods to use radar to more accurately measure and predict rainfall instead of just detecting it.</p>

        <p>This seems relevant given the  casualties and damage from heavy rains and floods. Sometimes things as simple as counting raindrops can make a difference.</p>
