        <p>An upstate New York furniture maker whose armoires, nightstands, desks and other pieces are sold in major stores and used in top-ranking hotels, plans to invest nearly $2 million to buy and enlarge its factory in Salamanca, in western New York. The manufacturer, Philadelphia Furniture Manufacturing Company, has been leasing its four-story, 150,000-square-foot plant since it was established in 1997 in a building previously used by the Fancher Furniture Company, from which Philadelphia will buy the site, Ron Gilbert, Philadelphia's controller, said yesterday. He said his company planned to add 45 workers to its force of 147; state officials said this made the company eligible for a $75,000 state grant. Philadelphia's pieces are sold in retail furniture outlets like Ethan Allen and used in hotels like the Plaza in Manhattan.</p>
