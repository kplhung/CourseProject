        <p>USA Today continued to widen its circulation lead among daily newspapers in the last six months, reaching 1,777,500, about 1.1 percent above its level in the fall of 1999 and 15,000 more than its longtime circulation rival, The Wall Street Journal, according to figures reported yesterday by the Audit Bureau of Circulations.</p>
        <p>The Journal's circulation rose about 0.6 percent, to 1,762,800, while The New York Times increased its daily circulation by 1 percent, to 1,097,200, and its Sunday circulation by 1.9 percent, to 1,682,200, in the six-month period ended on Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>The two daily newspapers in Denver, which plan to combine their advertising, circulation and marketing functions while keeping the two newsrooms as competitors with each other, continued to reap the circulation gains of their price war. Daily circulation of The Denver Post rose 11.4 percent, to 420,000, while daily circulation of The Denver Rocky Mountain News rose 7.6 percent, to 426,500.</p>
        <p>Daily circulation at The Los Angeles Times, which was acquired by the Tribune Company -- along with the rest of the Times Mirror Company newspapers -- in a deal announced last March, dropped 4.2 percent, to 1,033,400, in the wake of The Times's decision to abandon a program that had bundled some copies of The Times with copies of La Opinion, a local Spanish-language newspaper.</p>
        <p>The Washington Post's daily circulation remained basically flat at 762,000, but its Sunday circulation dropped 1.6 percent, to 1,065,000.</p>
        <p>There were also significant declines in Sunday circulation at The Philadelphia Inquirer (which dropped to 798,300, or 2.7 percent below the September 1999 figure); The Daily News of New York (down 2.8 percent, to 790,900); and the combined Detroit News and Free Press (down 2.7 percent, to 748,400.)</p>
        <p>Daily circulation rose slightly at all the newspapers in the New York City area. Besides The Times, The News increased daily circulation by three-tenths of 1 percent, to 704,500. The New York Post, which cut its daily newsstand price to 25 cents during the last month of the measurement period, increased its circulation 1.4 percent, to 444,000. The Post's Sunday circulation rose 1.1 percent, to 365,300.</p>
        <p>At Newsday, daily and Sunday circulation were basically flat, at 576,300 and 674,700, respectively. The Newark Star-Ledger's daily and Sunday circulation also had very small percentage gains, to 407,600 and 608,000 respectively.</p>
        <p>The Newspaper Association of America, which combined the new circulation figures for the 785 newspapers reporting to the audit bureau, reported a drop of 0.4 percent in overall daily circulation and 0.7 percent in Sunday circulation.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 1, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about newspaper circulation figures issued by the Audit Bureau of Circulations misstated the result for The Daily News of New York on Sundays for the six months ended Sept. 30. Its circulation was basically unchanged in comparison with the period last year. The figure did not decline by 2.8 percent.</p>
