        <p>Politicians heading for the Dutch Parliament the other day came across a novel sight: a large gathering of family doctors setting off on a protest march.</p>
        <p>There were doctors in pajamas, doctors brandishing outsize syringes fashioned from curtain rods, and doctors with unusual instruments like cans of spray paint and ink.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to keep the mood light and friendly,'' said a physician who wore a sheepish grin in his new role as the bearer of a protest banner.</p>
        <p>The issue, though, was serious enough. More than 1,000 family doctors had traveled to The Hague to tell Parliament that they were overwhelmed with work but gravely underpaid.</p>
        <p>They said the Health Ministry had long ignored their urgent pleas for the need to reduce their 70-hour weeks and for more subsidies to hire extra staff members because demands on primary care physicians were expanding year after year.</p>
        <p>''This is the first doctors' demonstration in the history of the country,'' said Dr. Willem Bijleveld, a protest organizer. ''We are a dutiful lot. We're not rebellious types. So this march shows how much dissatisfaction there is among the doctors.''</p>
        <p>By the standards of neighbors like Germany and Belgium, Dr. Bijleveld said, family doctors in the Netherlands have more patients -- on average 2,350 per physician -- and earn less, about $50,000 a year after taxes and overhead. They usually work 10 hours or more a day and must do one shift of evening and all-night duty every week.</p>
        <p>While work has increased, the physicians say, their fees, which are largely determined by the government, have stood still.</p>
        <p>The physicians' protest has also drawn fresh attention to another, more complex question: why is the workload of health care workers expanding in a rich country where people have never been as well looked after and healthy as they are today?</p>
        <p>The answers offered by physicians  point to basic shifts in Dutch society.</p>
        <p>They say that as the population ages, with more people living longer and often alone, more demands are made on family doctors. Such physicians are often responsible for lengthy terminal care in the home.</p>
        <p>While hospitals provide more and better surgery, patients must wait longer, during which time ''family doctors must look after them,'' Dr. Bijleveld said.</p>
        <p>The decline of religion is also taking its toll.</p>
        <p>''Social and mental problems end up more and more in the doctor's office,'' said Dr. Joop Arends, a physician in Amsterdam. In the past, people often took such troubles to their clergyman.</p>
        <p>Another issue is the large number of immigrants and refugees who have settled in the Netherlands. ''You're working against cultural barriers and language barriers and in the meantime your waiting room is full,'' Dr. Bijleveld said.</p>
        <p>As patients have become better informed, they are demanding more time and explanations from doctors.</p>
        <p>''People go on the Internet and they come with a lot of theories and information,'' Dr. Peter Reurs said. ''That's fine, but most of us don't have time for lengthy debates.''</p>
