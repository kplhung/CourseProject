        <p>British authorities said they would investigate claims in British and Brazilian newspapers that British American Tobacco P.L.C., the maker of Lucky Strike and other brands, had smuggled cigarettes. The Department of Trade and Industry said the inquiry was in response to a call by a parliamentary panel. B.A.T. said it was ''disappointed'' with the development but would cooperate with investigators. Investors shrugged off the inquiry as B.A.T. shares rose as much as 2.8 percent, to 495.5 pence, adding to its gains over the last year.</p>
