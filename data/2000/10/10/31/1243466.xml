        <p>A judge yesterday set aside the 1996 conviction of a homeless parolee who was found guilty of arson and murder in an apparently accidental fire that killed a firefighter, in a highly emotional case that rallied both the Fire Department and critics of the state's parole system.</p>
        <p>The judge, Robert J. Hanophy of State Supreme Court in Queens, ruled that the man's lawyer had not given him adequate advice about several plea offers from the prosecution. The jury concluded that the failure of the man, Edwin Smith, to tell firefighters that no one was left inside the burning building was so reckless that it constituted murder. He was sentenced to 17 years to life in prison for second-degree murder, fourth-degree arson and criminal trespass.</p>

        <p>A judge yesterday set aside the 1996 conviction of a homeless parolee who was found guilty of arson and murder in an apparently accidental fire that killed a firefighter, in a highly emotional case that rallied both the Fire Department and critics of the state's parole system.</p>
        <p>The judge, Robert J. Hanophy of State Supreme Court in Queens, ruled that the man's lawyer had not given him adequate advice about several plea offers from the prosecution. The jury concluded that the failure of the man, Edwin Smith, to tell firefighters that no one was left inside the burning building was so reckless that it constituted murder. He was sentenced to 17 years to life in prison for second-degree murder, fourth-degree arson and criminal trespass.</p>
        <p>In a written statement yesterday, Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said he would appeal the judge's ruling.  ''The record is clear that the defendant received effective assistance of competent counsel at all stages of the proceedings, and was properly advised by both his attorney and the court of the ramifications of refusing to accept a reasonable plea offer,'' Mr. Brown wrote.</p>
        <p>If the appeal fails, Mr. Smith will be tried again, said Mary de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brown.</p>
        <p>The fire occurred on New Year's Eve in 1995, after Mr. Smith, according to his testimony, lighted a makeshift candle for heat and light in an abandoned building in Jamaica, Queens, in which he was squatting. When the fire got out of control, he and other occupants fled. Prosecutors said Mr. Smith had made a ''conscious decision'' not to tell firefighters the building was empty.</p>
        <p>Lt. John M. Clancy, 35, entered the building to see if anyone needed to be rescued. A floor collapsed, and he fell to his death. Lieutenant Clancy, the son of a firefighter and the son-in-law of another, was hailed as a hero. His wife, Dawn, was about six months pregnant with their first child when he died. Nearly 9,000 firefighters attended his funeral on Long Island in uniform. His death came during a rash of firefighter deaths in the city; it was the 9th of 11 in a two-year period. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani seized on the case, criticizing the state parole system, which had allowed Mr. Smith, a drug offender, to go free, and lashing out at those who ''romanticize'' squatters.</p>
        <p>Although the mayor seemed intent on focusing the blame on the parole system and squatters, Mr. Smith had been arrested on a misdemeanor drug charge a month before the fire, but was not taken into custody by the police.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the building that burned had long been the object of neighborhood complaints, and yet the Police Department did not take control of the house as a public nuisance. The Fire Department acknowledged that the local fire station had identified the building as a danger, but failed to notify the city authorities who could seal or demolish it.</p>
        <p>But when it came to Mr. Smith, who had served two prison sentences for drug convictions, officials acted swiftly. The arson charge against him allowed prosecutors to bring a murder charge as well.</p>
        <p>According to Judge Hanophy's 15-page decision, Michael P. Mays took on Mr. Smith's case at no charge. Judge Hanophy offered Mr. Smith several opportunities to accept a plea deal for as little as six years in prison, the decision said.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Mays never told Mr. Smith that he should take the plea deal, the judge concluded, based on testimony from Mr. Mays and Mr. Smith at a hearing on the motion to overturn the conviction, filed by Ronald L. Kuby, Mr. Smith's new lawyer. At the hearing, Mr. Smith said he had never understood that if he were found guilty of arson, he would also be found guilty of murder.</p>
        <p>Interviewed yesterday, Mr. Mays said he had explained all the ramifications of a plea deal to his client. ''We discussed what you could face, what you could get,'' he said. ''He was pretty alert, pretty sharp. He was not just a teenager who was stuck in the spotlights of the car.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't tell him, 'Edwin, take the plea,' and I didn't tell him, 'Don't take the plea,' '' Mr. Mays said.</p>
        <p>The judge himself repeatedly urged Mr. Smith to consider the plea offers, according to transcripts of court proceedings. In one instance, Judge Hanophy said, ''I am telling you, this case comes out felony murder, the headline in the New York news: 'Client turns down six years.' ''</p>
        <p>To which Mr. Mays replied, ''It could also be the other way, your honor.''</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Clancy's wife and mother could not be reached for comment. But his sister, Diane Gellermann, reached in Phoenix, said her mind was more on her brother, whose child, John, was born two weeks before her 4-year-old daughter, than on the man who lighted the fire that caused his death.</p>
        <p>''I felt like he was a drug addict who had a problem,'' she said, quickly adding, ''We think about John often, especially since holiday season is coming.''</p>
        <p>At Lieutenant Clancy's old firehouse, Engine 298 in Jamaica, news of the judge's decision brought up  memories of an agonizing time, Capt. Bruce Groth said.</p>
        <p>''People went through a lot of hard times here when it happened, the trial took a long time, everything was basically settled, and now it's coming up again,'' he said. ''But what are you going to do?''</p>
        <p>But Captain Groth added that the decision was not necessarily the wrong one. ''We can't say if he got bad counsel,'' he said, ''but if he did, is he entitled to a fair trial? I guess.''</p>
