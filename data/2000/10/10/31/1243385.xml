        <p>When F. Scott Fitzgerald said there were no second acts in America, he must have had it mixed up with some other country. Maybe France.</p>
        <p>''Stick with me, and I'll stick with you,'' hollered Hillary Clinton, the front-running candidate for the U.S. Senate, last weekend. Her voice was hoarse, and she was on her second Sunday church service, with five more events to go.</p>
        <p>It's awesome, really, the way Mrs. Clinton has transformed herself from failed co-president and betrayed first lady into a politician in her own right. I've always wondered if the women who line up to get her autograph see her as not only a candidate, but a hopeful sign. If your job is maybe not that great, or your family life unsatisfactory, it's still possible to turn your life around in middle age. There's Hillary, who made a disastrous wrong turn when she tried to hitch her star to her husband's career, and look at her now -- the Xena of midlife career changes.</p>
        <p>This is the most attractive side of the Clinton saga -- their unsinkabil ity. Personally, there are days when even the least little thing -- say, an announcement from the cockpit that my plane will not be leaving because the pilot can't buckle his seat belt -- is enough to make me want to throw in the towel. But there is Mrs. Clinton, who sunk the administration's health initiative, got hauled before a grand jury, was humiliated by a feckless spouse, and still wrote herself a whole new script for Act II. It's an inspiration to us all.</p>
        <p>This story would be a little tidier if Mrs. Clinton bought into it. But she isn't really willing to disavow Act I, particularly her decision to combine the roles of spouse and policy maker in her husband's administration. ''Well, you know, we had done it in Arkansas and it had worked really well. And on everything except health care it worked pretty well for the last eight years,'' she said as her bus tooled across western New York.</p>
        <p>While Hillary talked with her staff or gave interviews, Chelsea Clinton was reading a very long book, perfectly suited for a drive from Ithaca to Buffalo to Utica to Albany. At every stop, the two of them emerged. Mrs. Clinton made her remarks and her daughter shook hundreds of hands, saying ''thank you for coming'' and ''we need your vote'' over and over and over. (There comes a time in many women's lives when we start wondering if we can ever make it up to our mothers for what we owe them. It is entirely possible that Chelsea Clinton has evened the score during this one campaign.)</p>
        <p>At a newly opened Krispy Kreme store on the outskirts of Buffalo, Mrs. Clinton signed pastry boxes while Chelsea thanked more people for coming. Traffic was backed up as far as the eye could see, a development that turned out to have nothing to do with the presence of the first lady/ Senate candidate. The Krispy Kreme store has turned into such a local attraction that people said they sometimes wait in line for two hours to get to the drive-in window. Obviously, this campaign needs to devote more attention to the lack of entertainment options in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>The president may call the campaign a half-dozen times a day to offer advice, but the operation is very much the reflection of Hillary Clinton's own style, which is to work very hard and never say anything interesting or off-script. There were plenty of consultants who told her that New Yorkers like feisty campaigners with some pizazz. But Mrs. Clinton has tried pizazz, and pizazz is not her friend.</p>
        <p>Instead, she goes from town to town, distributing her economic development plan (''Support tourism  . . . encourage high-tech entrepreneurs to locate here . . .''). Meanwhile, her opponents seem to self-destruct. There's something about her that makes people go crazy and fling charges so outrageous that they boomerang back on the person who made them. Does anybody actually believe Mrs. Clinton had a role in the explosion on the U.S.S. Cole? Nobody's tried to pin the West Nile virus on her yet, but we still have a week to go.</p>
        <p>If she wins, she instantly wipes out her identity as Bill Clinton's wife and becomes a high-ranking elected official from a state he barely knows. If Al Gore loses the election, she'll also enter the ranks of the Great Mentioneds for the 2004 presidential nomination. If Elizabeth Dole made the cut, there will be no way of keeping Senator Clinton off the list.</p>
        <p>Talk about a change of scenery.</p>
