        <p>In a case of grass roots meets back room, a handful of Web sites have sprung up in last few weeks promoting the notion that supporters of Vice President Al Gore and Ralph Nader barter votes and even giving them a forum to do so.</p>
        <p>The idea is that backers of Mr. Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, in states where Mr. Gore and Gov. George W.

        <p>In a case of grass roots meets back room, a handful of Web sites have sprung up in last few weeks promoting the notion that supporters of Vice President Al Gore and Ralph Nader barter votes and even giving them a forum to do so.</p>
        <p>The idea is that backers of Mr. Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, in states where Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are running neck and neck would cast their vote for Mr. Gore, and help out the man they see as a better choice. In exchange, a voter in a sure Gore state would vote for Mr. Nader and help the Greens reach the 5 percent threshold the party needs to qualify for federal financing.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to tell how much difference the vote trading could make in the election. But it highlights the growing potency of the Internet's role in democracy.</p>
        <p>Most campaigns have Web sites, and candidates commonly solicit money over the Internet and advertise on other sites. More and more voters are extracting election information from their computers.</p>
        <p>But those who study the Internet's role in politics see something special here.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to have a big effect on the election, but it's the first time I've seen voters talk to each other in a sophisticated way without having to go through the media or parties,'' said Michael B. Cornfield, an associate professor of politics at George Washington University.</p>
        <p>''This is voters behaving like legislators: 'I'll do this for you, and you do this for me, and we both get what we want,' '' Prof. Cornfield said. ''Trading is something that elites do, not the masses.''</p>
        <p>All three campaigns disavowed any connection with the sites, though a Bush campaign spokesman saw the Web sites as ''loosely organized by the Gore campaign.''</p>
        <p>''I'm sure it's one step removed,'' said the spokesman, Dan Bartlett. ''It shows the panic that has stricken through the Gore ranks.''</p>
        <p>Gore campaign officials said the Democratic strategy has been to take aim at Nader supporters by emphasizing what is dear to them. ''We believe that many Nader voters are concerned about freedom of choice, the environment, and don't want to see those issues put at risk by a Bush presidency,'' said a Gore spokesman, Doug Hattaway.</p>
        <p>Battleground states where votes for Mr. Nader could undermine Mr. Gore are Oregon, Wisconsin and Minnesota, as well as Washington and Michigan to a lesser extent, Gore campaign officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett saw the Internet campaign as having a negligible effect on the race, while Mr. Hattaway would not speculate, calling it a ''wild card.''</p>
        <p>The Nader campaign maintained a certain remove: ''We're telling voters to vote their conscience in every state,'' said a spokeswoman, Laura Jones.</p>
        <p>At least five sites are dedicated to what some call ''Nader Trading.'' One, www.votexchange2000.com, allows one to enter a preference -- Gore-turned-Nader voter, or vice versa -- and an e-mail address. The site automatically provides a matching voter who had previously sent in a request.</p>
        <p>Participants number in the low thousands, said Alan Porter, a San Francisco Web designer who said he came up with the idea over lunch on Oct. 23 with several colleagues. The site was up in two days.</p>
        <p>''Before the debates, I really expected Gore to shine, and he hasn't,'' Mr. Porter said. ''We just got nervous about the situation, and I think that's what inspired us to actually do something.''</p>
        <p>The site, www.voteexchange.org, allows voters to request trades and respond to requests. Another, www.voteswap2000.com, says nearly 5,000 people have taken part.</p>
        <p>Mr. Porter acknowledges that the idea has a ''potential flaw.'' Traders remain anonymous, so there is no guarantee each side will follow through, or that Bush supporters might not try to manipulate the system. Participants are encouraged to contact each other to judge intent.</p>
        <p>Jamin Raskin, a constitutional law professor at American University, published a piece in the Slate online magazine advocating the practice. The article was posted on Oct. 24, around the time the sites began appearing.</p>
        <p>''I've been agonizing like a lot of progressive Democrats who have been excited by Nader's revitalization of progressive politics, but don't want to see Bush elected president,'' Prof. Raskin said. ''It occurred to me that there was a win-win scenario out there.''</p>
