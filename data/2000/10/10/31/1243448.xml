        <p>Power to the people was Al Gore's cry today as he trundled across the fading emerald farmland of Wisconsin in his ongoing struggle to blunt the appeal of Ralph Nader and keep traditionally Democratic states in his column.</p>
        <p>''You have the power to overrule the special interests if you will exercise that power,'' he said at an enthusiastic rally to more than a thousand people packed into a stuffy high school gymnasium here tonight.</p>
        <p>He promised that as president he would hold an average of one open meeting a week with ordinary citizens. He promised not to add a single extra job to the federal government. And he returned repeatedly to his vow to make the overhaul of the campaign finance system his top legislative priority.</p>
        <p>''We need to give democracy back to you, the people!'' Mr. Gore declared at a lunchtime rally in front of the copper-domed courthouse in Green Bay.</p>
        <p>''I believe in listening to the people,'' he said. ''If you elect me president, I will have an average of one open meeting every week with people throughout this country to get your ideas on a regular basis, to listen to you, to work for you and fight for you.''</p>
        <p>Senator Russell D. Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who -- with Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican -- has championed campaign-finance reform, gave Mr. Gore his endorsement today. And Mr. Gore spoke at length at his rallies about the importance of diminishing the effect of money in politics -- a major plank in the platform of Mr.  Nader, the longtime consumer advocate whose appeal to voters in states like Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Washington and Oregon could tip the election to Mr. Gore's rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>In an interview tonight, Mr. Gore said he had not tailored his message to win over Nader supporters. He also said he had ''not talked to a single person'' about trying to persuade Mr. Nader to get out of the race.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Gore is to fly from Milwaukee to Portland, Ore., where he hopes a last-minute rally can move that state his way.</p>
        <p>Carter Eskew, a top Gore strategist, said that Mr. Gore might break through to Nader voters with two particular themes -- discussion of campaign finance and a reminder that abortion rights are at stake in this election. Mr. Gore focused heavily on both.</p>
        <p>''The Supreme Court is at risk here,'' he said in Green Bay. ''Equal rights and women's rights and civil rights and disability rights and federalism and antitrust law and the basic interpretation of our Constitution for the next 30 to 40 years is very much on the ballot this fall.''</p>
        <p>On the subject of revamping campaign finance, Mr. Gore said that the drug companies and insurance industry were backing Mr. Bush to protect their profits.</p>
        <p>''It is morally wrong for the decisions about your health to be made on the basis of what is going to improve the bottom line for an H.M.O. rather than on the basis of what's best for your health,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The H.M.O.'s and the big insurance companies have been able to use their wealth and their political influence and power to convince a majority in the Congress to block a patient's bill of rights,'' he declared. ''They want to stay in control of the medical decisions. And they're supporting Governor Bush because they want him in control of the medical quality. I want to fight for you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was not all earnestness today. He doffed his jacket at the Green Bay rally, telling the crowd,  ''It's chilly, but I'm hot, and I'm telling you, this election is hot!''</p>
        <p>He noted that there were just eight days until Election Day, saying he would work eight days a week. ''Eight days a week, as the Beatles sang,'' he said in his almost-daily reference to baby boomer music. The other day at a rally when the amplifiers screeched with feedback, he said it sounded like the opening of a song by Creedence Clearwater Revival.</p>
        <p>Off and on throughout the day, more than two dozen vehicles in the Gore bus caravan snaked southward through Wisconsin. After drawing a crowd of 30,000 people last week in Madison, Mr. Gore is gaining a slight edge over Mr. Bush, the polls show. Still, Mr. Nader continues to draw a fraction of the vote, which could prove crucial to Mr. Gore in the final balloting.</p>
        <p>The same is true in Michigan, where Mr. Gore began his day where it had ended the night before, in Muskegon. This morning, he stood on the shore of Lake Michigan in a blue suit and read a slightly retooled stump speech to about 200 people who were sitting on chairs planted in the sand, bundled up against the morning chill.</p>
        <p>The serene setting and low-key tone of the event softened an edge to the words that Mr. Gore summoned against Mr. Bush. He said that Mr. Bush would ''play games'' with Social Security and leave families ''worse off than they are today.''</p>
        <p>Saying that his own smaller tax cut would allow the nation to pay down the debt, Mr. Gore said that Governor Bush's larger tax cut would ''repeat the past, like a broken record, letting the wealthiest Americans gorge themselves on tax cuts they don't really need.'' Americans ''deserve a president who champions all of the people and doesn't just cave in to the few,'' Mr. Gore said. And they ''deserve better than rubber checks to pay for runaway spending and a rubber stamp for the powerful interests.''</p>
        <p>In the pledge department, Mr. Gore vowed to make government smaller, saying, ''I will not add to the number of people doing work for the federal government -- not even by even one position.''</p>
