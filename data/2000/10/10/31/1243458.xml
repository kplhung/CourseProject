        <p>More than a year after its owners put the Carlyle Hotel up for sale, a potential deal to buy the high-end Manhattan property has stalled, and negotiations with dozens of would-be suitors have yet to find a buyer.</p>
        <p>Despite a spate of recent rumors at Manhattan's real estate brokerage firms that a buyer has been found, ''the Carlyle has not been sold, and there is no contract in place with any of the potential purchasers,'' Dan Camp, its managing director, said of the hotel, an Upper East Side preserve of presidents, prime ministers and popular legends.</p>
        <p>Since last year, the sale of the Carlyle, a 70-year-old hotel at 35 East 76th Street, has been a preoccupation of both its staff and its celebrity patrons, many of whom have worried that it would be diminished by a bottom line-oriented buyer. Viewed by former guests ranging from Brooke Astor to Woody Allen as an oasis of sophistication in a fast-changing city, the Carlyle has been identified with the martini-dry presence of Bobby Short, the saloon singer who has performed regularly in the Cafe Carlyle since 1968.</p>
        <p>In late September and early October, articles in Indian publications said that the Tata group, a privately held communications, manufacturing and service-industry company in Bombay, would soon acquire a New York hotel for $143 million.</p>
        <p>''The Tata group is one of three potential buyers with whom there have been substantive negotiations,'' said Norman L. Peck, the managing partner of the Carlyle, who heads its ownership group. Another executive with knowledge of the negotiations confirmed that there were two other serious bidders.</p>
        <p>Tata owns the Indian Hotels Company Limited, which in turn owns the Taj group of hotels, the largest in India. The Taj, in turn, owns or manages more than 50 hotels in half a dozen countries, including the St. James Court Hotel and Apartments in London.</p>
        <p>R. K. Krishna Kumar, the managing director of Tata's Indian Hotels Company, said of the talks, ''It is much too premature to make a comment at this time.''</p>
        <p>The intense secrecy imposed by the Carlyle has given the normally talkative real estate community little hint of potential buyers. The articles about the Tata bid are believed to have surfaced because the group was required to register for permission from the Bank of India to move more than $100 million outside the country, in order to make planned -- but unnamed -- foreign hotel acquisitions, according to real estate executives with knowledge of the group.</p>
        <p>But in the month since those articles predicting an imminent sale, no deal has been struck. The sticking point in the talks is believed to be the Carlyle's unusual ownership structure, a cooperative. Potential owners must buy controlling shares in the cooperative rather than buying the title to the buildings and the land.</p>
        <p>Despite this setup, brokers say, the the 180-room Carlyle could command at least $100 million (or more than $500,000 per residence unit), because of its location, history and devoted clientele. They said some buyers might see it as a trophy property that could create its own worldwide brand.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Peck said in June that the Carlyle would not sell for less than the Four Seasons Hotel, on East 57th Street and Madison Avenue, which in 1999 was sold to Ty Warner, the inventor of Beanie Babies, for $275 million (about $750,000 per room). A cost of $750,000 per room would put the Carlyle's asking price at about $130 million.</p>
        <p>As the months have passed, the identities of other potential buyers have been the subject of lively speculation among real-estate people. Among names mentioned have been the Orient-Express Hotels, based in London, the Rosewood Hotels and Resorts in Dallas and the Bauer Grunwald Hotel in Venice. The companies' representatives had no comment.</p>
        <p>The Indian Hotels Company sold the Lexington Plaza Hotel in Manhattan last year for a reported $105 million and has been shopping for a luxury hotel in Manhattan to project a high-end image internationally, according to Indian publications.</p>
