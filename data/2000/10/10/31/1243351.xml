        <p>Hidden Treasures  From the Soviet government came orders to destroy the paintings. Emphasizing the beauty and power of pure form, these works by abstract artists were deemed threats to Communist ideals. But museum directors knew that the paintings were historic and believed that lovers of art must not destroy art. The works were rediscovered in the late 1980's. Tomorrow 86 of them, most never exhibited in the United States, go on view at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. Assembled from 13 Russian museums, ''Painting Revolution: Kandinsky, Malevich and the Russian Avant-Garde'' continues through Jan. 7.</p>
        <p>Art and Ordeal  Recruited as a mapmaker, Robert Knox Sneden enlisted in the 40th New York Infantry Regiment of the Army of the Potomac in 1861. Before the Civil War ended, he saw combat, was taken captive at pistol point in 1863 and was held in infamous Confederate prisons like Andersonville, where he documented his experiences with sketches he hid in his shoes or sewed into his coat. Permanently disabled by his 13 months in prison, he passed time by turning his pencil sketches into watercolors. Beginning tomorrow, nearly 100 of these detailed watercolors will be on view in ''Eye of the Storm: The Civil War Drawings of Robert Knox Sneden,'' an exhibition running through Dec. 31 at the New-York Historical Society at the outset of a national tour.</p>

        <p>World of Wonders  The love life of mollusks, female wrestling in Japan, the Rastafari culture, and compensation for slave labor under the Nazis. These are the subjects of but a few of the 90 films from 32 countries to be seen starting on Friday in the annual Margaret Mead Film and Video Festival at the American Museum of Natural History. The festival, running through Nov. 11, the includes a tribute to the filmmaker Mira Nair and a series on disability. Opening night will be devoted to nine of the fantastic works of the French naturalist Jean Painleve (1902-1989), including ''The Vampire'' (1945), a bat study set to a Duke Ellington score; and ''Acera, or the Witches' Dance'' (1972), about hermaphroditic creatures.</p>
        <p>Footnotes  Joining literati like Mark Twain, Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville, Edna St. Vincent Millay has been inducted into the Poet's Corner at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. . . . Letters, photos, posters and other materials that document the 50-year show business career of Abe Burrows have been donated by his family to the Billy Rose Theater Collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.</p>
