        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Oct. 29 editorial endorsement of Al Gore for president was thoughtful and wise. My only suggestion is that you seemed too kind to George W. Bush. His ''compassionate conservatism'' strikes me as a well-intended form of lip service that belies a profound lack of insight into the consequences of one's actions.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Oct. 29 editorial endorsement of Al Gore for president was thoughtful and wise. My only suggestion is that you seemed too kind to George W. Bush. His ''compassionate conservatism'' strikes me as a well-intended form of lip service that belies a profound lack of insight into the consequences of one's actions.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt in my mind that his more radical supporters cynically see this as a great strategy, and sad to say, it seems to be working.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the unspoken Republican conservative philosophy lies a belief in ''everyone for himself'' and ''me and mine first.'' These Darwinian core values stand in stark contrast to an awareness of our interdependency, respect for diversity, recognition of the need for collaboration and a willingness to work for the good of the whole.</p>
        <p>Whichever values we choose, we will deserve the consequences.</p>
