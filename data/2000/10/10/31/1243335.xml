        <p>THE UNABRIDGED JOURNALS OF SYLVIA PLATH: 1950-1962  Edited by Karen V. Kukil  732 pages. Anchor Books. $18.</p>
        <p>In her own poems Sylvia Plath tirelessly mythologized herself as a doomed Electra, a ''Lady Lazarus'' eating ''men like air,'' a Persephone drawn ineluctably toward an underworld of death and despair. In the wake of her 1963 suicide, the mythification continued: feminists eulogized her as a victim of her father and her philandering husband, Ted Hughes, while others enshrined her as a tragic figure -- ''a Dido, Phaedra or Medea'' in the words of Robert Lowell.</p>
        <p>The publication of Plath's unabridged journals provides us with a fuller, more nuanced portrait of her: this ''litany of dreams, directives and imperatives,'' as she once described her diary, gives us a depressed, self-dramatizing woman, but it also gives us the popular, golden coed familiar to readers from her letters to her mother (''Letters Home'').</p>
        <p>Sometimes Plath comes across as a boy-crazy Cosmo girl: ''The main problem is to make him want and need me.'' Sometimes as a willful narcissist ''splashing about in the shallow waters'' of her own narrow psyche: ''My interest in other people is too often one of comparison, not of pure intrigue with the unique otherness of identity.'' Sometimes as a ruthless Machiavellian striver: ''I want the world's praise, money &amp; love, and am furious with anyone, especially anyone I know or has had a similar experience, getting ahead of me.''</p>
        <p>What is perhaps most striking about these journals, however, is their depiction of Plath's embrace of ordinary life -- primping in a ''swish aqua strapless cotton with the little jacket,'' making an afternoon date for tennis, whipping up the perfect lemon-meringue pie from the ''Joy of Cooking'' -- and her haunting knowledge that her psychological well-being depended upon her remaining anchored to ''some external reality,'' some shared ordinariness of ''laundry and lilacs, daily bread and fried eggs.''</p>
        <p>Large portions of these journals were published in 1982, but that book, edited by Hughes and Frances McCullough, was riddled with cuts for space and deliberate omissions. Much of what was left out had to do with Plath's exuberant youthful sensuality (''I want very much to hold the strength of his broad back to me and to shut my eyes and go away on the good slow black tide of his kisses''), her roiling hatred of her mother and her tumultuous relationship with Hughes, her muse and savior and betrayer.</p>
        <p>Left out, for instance, were passages in which she called Hughes ''a liar and a vain smiler,'' after discovering him taking a walk with a pretty student, and left out, as well, were complaints about his ''dirty hair, ragged nails.'' These are fairly minor, harmless omissions as such things go, and the portrait of their relationship remains decidedly provisional even in this unexpurgated book.</p>
        <p>There is little on the courtship of Plath and Hughes, beyond their famous first kiss (''He kissed me bang smash on the mouth and ripped my hairband off''), and little on the unraveling of their marriage. Still missing, after all, is the final volume of Plath's journals, which Hughes said he destroyed ''because I did not want her children to have to read it,'' as well as another journal from her final years, which he said mysteriously ''disappeared.''</p>
        <p>In this book it is the restored passages about Plath's mother, Aurelia, that show Plath at her most extreme and violent and deranged. She denounces her mother as ''a walking vampire'' who killed her father by ''marrying him too old'' and ''burying him every day since in her heart, mind and words''; ''a murderess of maleness,'' ''a killer'' as ''deadly as a cobra under that shiny greengold hood.''</p>
        <p>Plath writes in these pages of her ''old need of giving mother accomplishments, getting reward of love,'' and part of her would remain an A student throughout her life. Her journals are filled with exhortations to alchemize the dross of life into the gold of prose (every day, she told herself, write ''at least 2 to 3 solid pages describing a remembered incident with characters &amp; conversation &amp; descriptions'') and to better herself as a person.</p>
        <p>''The only problem,'' she writes, ''is to work, to stay awake mentally and physically -- and NEVER to become mentally, physically, or spiritually flabby or over-complacent.'' She drives herself to learn German, to study painting, to scrutinize the work of rival poets and to master new poetic techniques.</p>
        <p>So ingrained was her need for approval (and her need to see her poems published) that Plath was inclined to regard everything that happened to her as fresh material: pregnancy, she muses in 1959, might provide the opportunity for ''some good pregnant poems.'' And later that year she observes: ''There is an increasing market for mental-hospital stuff. I am a fool if I don't relive, recreate it.''</p>
        <p>Though Plath had moments of great arrogance -- ''I think I have written lines which qualify me to be The Poetess of America,'' she writes at one point -- she had even more bouts of self-loathing and self-doubt. She was troubled about her ability to balance the vocations of wife and mother with that of an artist (''the lady or the tigress''), worried by her emotional dependence on Hughes, and hyper-aware of the fear of abandonment that her father's early death had bequeathed her. She writes pages and pages animated by envy and self-pity, then berates herself for being jealous and self-absorbed.</p>
        <p>For years writing had provided Plath with a means of reconciling her disparate selves, a tool for ''ordering and reordering the chaos of experience.'' It was, Plath wrote, ''a religious act,'' ''a reforming, a relearning and reloving of people and the world as they are and as they might be.'' In the end, however, even writing could not still ''the panic bird'' that always fluttered near her heart. On a cold February day in 1963, with her two small children asleep upstairs, Sylvia Plath put her head in her kitchen oven and turned on the gas. She was 30.</p>
