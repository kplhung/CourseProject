        <p>KYRGYZSTAN: PRESIDENT RE-ELECTED -- Askar Akayev was re-elected to a third term with nearly 75 percent of the vote in a six-man race, according to unofficial results released by the Central Election Commission. His nearest competitor was Omurbek Tekebayev, deputy speaker of the Parliament, who had 14 percent. The election was marred by intimidation and instances of ballot-box stuffing, said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other groups that monitored voting, but President Akayev called it fair and democratic.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: EX-LEADER LOSES COURT APPEAL -- A Pakistani court rejected the appeal of the ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif against his conviction for hijacking, court officials said. But a three-judge bench of the High Court of Sindh Province, whose capital is Karachi, also rejected a government appeal to turn Mr. Sharif's life imprisonment to a death sentence. He was sentenced in April to two life terms on charges of hijacking and terrorism for ordering the diversion of a plane carrying the military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and about 200 others from Sri Lanka to Karachi.</p>

        <p>INDIA: 'SUCCESSFUL' N-TESTS -- The Atomic Energy Commission chairman, Rajagopala Chidambaram, told a group of scientists at the Bhaba Atomic Research Center in Bombay that the five nuclear weapons tests India conducted in 1998 were ''completely successful'' and gave India the ability ''to design and fabricate weapons from low yield to around 200 kilotons.'' Some experts in India and abroad have doubted the efficacy of the 1998 nuclear tests.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: RENEWED CURFEW -- The government reimposed a curfew in two of the country's central tea-growing districts as tensions between the majority Sinhalese population and the Tamil minority continued to run high. A Sinhalese mob massacred 27 detained Tamil rebels on Wednesday. Rioting broke out Sunday after the funeral of one of the Tamils.</p>

        <p>LAOS: REMAINS RETURNED TO U.S. -- The government announced that it had given the United States the remains of four Americans listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War. The remains were handed over to American officials in a weekend ceremony the Laotian capital, Vientiane, the KPL news agency reported. They will be taken to the Army's Central Identification Lab in Hawaii for forensic tests.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: LEADERS' RIFT -- The vice president, Gloria Arroyo, who leads the opposition and is next in line for the presidency, rejected President Joseph Estrada's offer to head an economic panel to shore up investor confidence shattered by a bribery scandal. She also turned down Mr. Estrada's invitation to meet with the National Security Council to ease the political crisis. ''I cannot accept the position that he offered me,'' Ms. Arroyo said on television. ''It will not help restore credibility.''</p>

        <p>IRELAND: 'MAD COW' FEARS -- Residents of Galway, fearful of a contaminated water supply from ''mad cow'' disease, have dug up the carcass of an infected animal and returned it to its owner's farmyard. The opposition Labor Party environment spokesman, Eamon Gilmore, described the burial as ''effectively poisoning'' the water and said it went against advice on the disease given by a government scientific advisory panel last summer. The executive engineer in Galway County Council's environment department, John McMyler, has threatened to sue Ireland's Department of Agriculture under environmental pollution laws.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: INFLATED CENSUS? -- A week after Turks were confined to their homes for a daylong national census, government officials are trying to figure out how the count came up with five million more people than estimated. The population was supposed to be 65 million to 66 million, but the initial figure is more than 71 million. Few people believe the country is that populous, and census officials suspect local governments inflated the count to receive more money from the national budget, which is allocated on a per-capita basis. Some cities showed that populations had doubled in three years, and in one region, municipal officials were accused of counting tombstones.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: PUTIN VISIT -- On his first visit to France since taking office, President Vladimir V. Putin arrived for a meeting with European Union leaders. Though he travels frequently, Mr. Putin had avoided France, apparently because of its vocal opposition to the war in Chechnya. He was expected to discuss increasing exports of Russian oil and gas to Europe, as well as Europe's plans for a rapid-reaction force.</p>

        <p>PERU: REBELS WEAKEN -- A one-day rebellion by 60 soldiers began to crumble with desertions of up to 20 soldiers. After the rebels released four civilians held hostage, a general they held was rescued, the army said. The rebels, in Puno Province, are demanding the resignation of President Alberto K. Fujimori and the arrest of his former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos.</p>

        <p>CHILE: RIGHTIST WINS MAYORALTY -- Joaquin Lavin, the rightist who narrowly lost the presidency last year, won election as mayor of Santiago. In municipal voting around the country, the governing center-left Concertacion won a majority of the votes, but the rightists won mayoral elections in several large cities normally governed by the left.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: AMERICANS EVICTED -- More than 100 federal police officers, acting on an order from the high court, began evicting several dozen Americans from their homes on 45 acres of coastland in Baja California, government officials said. The Americans bought or leased the oceanfront properties in good faith from a Mexican land collective, the court ruled last week, but the collective had no right to the land, and Mexican law bars foreigners from owning property within 35 miles of the sea.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: ECOLOGISTS' SENTENCES UPHELD -- An appeals court has upheld the sentences of two peasant farmers active in an ecologists' movement, despite a federal rights panel's finding that the men were framed by army officers. The ruling, issued late Friday but not made public over the weekend, confirmed marijuana- and weapons-possession convictions against Rodolfo Montiel, leader of the peasant farmers' movement, which opposed illegal logging in the state of Guerrero, and Teodoro Cabrera, a member of the group.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: CAPITAL PROTEST -- Some 10,000 civil servants blocked major streets in Mexico City to protest President Ernesto Zedillo's decision not to pay them a bonus when he leaves office on Dec. 1. Bonuses were first given in the 1980's by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party as a kind of payment for loyalty at work and at the polls. But last July the party lost the presidency for the first time in its history. Mr. Zedillo's refusal to pay the bonuses -- worth about $500 million -- is widely seen as part of the fallout of the shifting political landscape.</p>

        <p>CANADA: THIRD ARREST IN JET BLAST -- The Vancouver police have arrested a third suspect in the 1985 bombing of an Air India jet. Hardial Singh Johal, former head of a Vancouver-area Sikh temple, was detained hours before Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, both followers of a fundamentalist Sikh group, appeared in court in Vancouver.</p>

        <p>ZAMBIA: KAUNDA AGAIN A CITIZEN -- With the withdrawal of a court case challenging his nationality, former President Kenneth Kaunda was given back Zambian citizenship. Mr. Kaunda, the father of modern Zambia, who governed for 27 years, was stripped of his citizenship last year after a petition by members of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy. In the new court proceeding, Patrick Katyoka, one of those who brought the challenge, formally withdrew it, saying he and his party colleagues believed that Mr. Kaunda was a statesman who deserved respect.</p>
