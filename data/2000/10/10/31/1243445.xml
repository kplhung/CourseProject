        <p>With just over a week before Election Day to attract voters in a tight race, the New York Senate candidates released a flurry of new advertisements as they traveled through parts of the state mining for votes among women, Catholics and the elderly.</p>
        <p>Their appearances and advertisements reaffirmed their stated intentions to battle using the airwaves and old-fashioned stumping for voters in upstate New York, a traditionally Republican stronghold but a region that according to a series of polls, Hillary Rodham Clinton is strongly contesting.</p>
        <p>Rick A. Lazio, the Republican nominee, spent much of the day courting women and Catholics, and released two television advertisements to be broadcast upstate, one featuring State Senator John A. DeFrancisco of Syracuse and the other Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive. Mr. Lazio also released a radio commercial narrated by Gov. George E. Pataki. All three advertisements in different ways play on Mr. Lazio's pitch to Italian-American Catholics.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's new ad also rolls out a prominent surrogate, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose seat the candidates are vying for. Mr. Lazio has often tried to connect with Mr. Moynihan's admirers during this campaign, even using an advertisement with shots altered to show the two of them together. But Mr. Moynihan today urged voters to choose Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The candidates continued to take shots at each other, though not with the ferocity of the past weekend, when their attacks centered on a telephone campaign by the Republican Party that invoked the bombing of the destroyer Cole to suggest a link between terrorism and some of Mrs. Clinton's Muslim donors. The party has stopped making the calls referring to the Naval destroyer but is continuing a campaign questioning Mrs. Clinton's commitment to Israel.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton completed a three-day bus tour with stops in Utica, Schenectady and Albany; Mr. Lazio traveled by bus and plane to New Rochelle, Rochester, Syracuse and to the Buffalo suburb of Lancaster and came here, where he went door to door to solicit votes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, starting the day with appearances on two network morning shows, talked about improving the upstate economy, but she also emphasized her other core themes of improving health care, protecting social security, providing tax cuts for certain groups and bringing down the cost of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>During a speech in Albany at the convention of the New York Statewide Senior Action Council, a nonpartisan advocacy group, Mrs. Clinton promised to fight on behalf of the estimated 64,000 New Yorkers on Medicare who she said were in danger of being dropped by their health maintenance organizations. She said that she would push to require H.M.O.'s that sign up Medicare patients to do so for at least two years, instead of the current one-year requirement.</p>
        <p>She criticized Mr. Lazio for a missing a vote on Sunday night in the House that she said would have provided greater security for patients on Medicare. A campaign aide said Mrs. Clinton was referring to an amendment by Representative Gary Ackerman to an appropriations bill. The amendment, which would have required H.M.O.'s to commit to cover Medicare patients for at least three years, failed, the aide said.</p>
        <p>''Just last night my opponent had a chance to vote on this issue in Congress and put an end to this unfair practice,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''He missed the vote. That's how important he thought this issue was.''</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said the congressman's presence would not have changed the outcome and he rebuked Mrs. Clinton for using a ''smokescreen'' to distort Mr. Lazio's ''long extensive record in the House.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also made references to Mr. Lazio as an ostrich for not recognizing the economic woes of upstate. One of her campaign ads makes the same point by featuring an ostrich sticking its head in the ground, and a person from the Working Families party has appeared in an ostrich costume at several of Mr. Lazio's events, including one here tonight. Mr. Lazio, who has advocated tax cuts to improve an economy he sees as better off than Mrs. Clinton's outlook, ignored it. (At Mrs. Clinton's events, in turn, a man dressed as Abraham Lincoln has appeared, a reference to her allowing donors to her campaign to stay over night in the Lincoln Bedroom.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio focused much of his day on women and Catholic voters, hitting a snag when Bishop James M. Moynihan of the Diocese of Syracuse declined to appear with the congressman after a 40-minute private meeting for what his campaign said was a photo opportunity. After the meeting, Mr. Lazio appeared alone outside the diocese offices, saying they had discussed a variety of topics in a ''very good meeting.''</p>
        <p>Patrick McCarthy, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said Bishop Moynihan had praised and blessed Mr. Lazio during the meeting but declined to make an appearance so as not to issue an ''implied endorsement.'' A spokeswoman from the bishop's office confirmed that explanation and said that the bishop had understood that the meeting would be private.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has made an aggressive appeal to Catholic voters, who make up about 45 percent of the electorate, and has held such photo opportunities with the Bishop of Buffalo and Archbishop Edward Egan of New York.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Lazio joined Governor Pataki at Sound Shore Medical Center in New Rochelle at a news conference for a new federal law for which Mr. Lazio had been a co-sponsor to help women finance their breast and cervical cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki promised to lobby state lawmakers to pass the necessary legislation for New York to opt into the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, which is intended to help women who do not qualify for government health insurance and cannot afford private insurance. Mr. Lazio has recently been using his role as a key sponsor of the bill as a sign of his commitment to women's issues.</p>
        <p>The governor, who has been campaigning with Mr. Lazio more frequently of late, said that of the 3,000 women whose cancer is diagnosed at free government screenings in the state, about 250 would qualify for the assistance authorized by the act.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio went on to Rochester for the fifth and final ''Women for Lazio'' forum, rally-like events he has staged to speak to large gatherings of women, and concluded his day with an appearance at an Erie County Republican Committee dinner in Lancaster.</p>
