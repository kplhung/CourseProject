        <p>Joe Torre might have been a Hollywood producer in a previous life, having demonstrated an appreciation for drama, a singular moment. After Torre summoned Derek Jeter and others to the microphone at the Yankees' parade yesterday, he closed by calling on Paul O'Neill and David Cone, together.</p>
        <p>Cone and O'Neill have been at the core of the Yankees' rebirth over the last six years, sharing in four championships, including the last three. Now they are each 37, and their appearance at City Hall yesterday, on a brisk and blustery day, may have been their last as players with the organization.</p>
        <p>''I just want to say it's truly been an honor to be a part of '96, '98, '99 and 2000 -- that's four,'' Cone said to the crowd.</p>
        <p>The players smiled and waved throughout the parade, some of them videotaping the hordes of fans, some of whom were videotaping the Yankees as the floats passed up Broadway on the way to City Hall. The cold did erode some of the enthusiasm: during the ceremony led by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the pitcher Orlando Hernandez and others could be seen shuddering and passing blankets among their ranks.</p>
        <p>By giving the stage last to O'Neill and Cone, Torre, the Yankees' manager, seemed to acknowledge the obvious -- that O'Neill and Cone might not be back. There have been similar scenes at City Hall the last few years, when veteran Yankees made foreboding appearances, only to be brought back the next year. After the 1998 season, Bernie Williams told chanting fans that they should ask George Steinbrenner whether he would come back, and last year, Cone made a playful pitch about wanting a two-year deal. (He eventually settled for a one-year, $12 million contract.)</p>
        <p>But Steinbrenner is a sentimentalist second and a hard-driving owner first, someone who pushes his executives to improve the team after every season, regardless of longstanding ties. O'Neill struggled at the end of this season and the Yankees are expected to bid heavily for a younger, more powerful right fielder: Manny Ramirez, the free agent from the Cleveland Indians. The only way O'Neill and Ramirez could be on the team together, it would seem, is if O'Neill were willing to accept a more limited role.</p>
        <p>Cone went 4-14 this season and the Yankees, soon to be flowing with new-found income from local television revenue, will pursue the All-Star right-hander Mike Mussina. There may not be room for Cone. ''Money is not going to be the question,'' Cone said yesterday before the parade. ''It's whether or not they want to give me a chance to be in the rotation.''</p>
        <p>Cone did not rule out the possibility that he would retire, but he indicated a clear preference for pitching next year. After vacationing in the Caribbean next week, he said, he would wait to hear whether the Yankees are interested in signing him.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what interest there's going to be,'' Cone said. ''I really haven't had time to think things through. Obviously, the Yankees are the No. 1 priority for me to see what they do, who they sign, what kind of interest they have in me, if any. I really haven't had any indication at all in what direction they're going to go. I think it's safe to say I'm not going to make $12 million next year. In actuality, my value may go up because I may be a bargain.''</p>
        <p>The reliever Jeff Nelson is also eligible for free agency. His request for a four-year, $16 million deal was rejected by the Yankees in spring training, but even after a summer in which he and Torre were occasionally at odds, the Yankees may eventually negotiate with him; statistically, the right-handed Nelson is the best available setup man on the market, and he again overcame midseason struggles to pitch very effectively in the postseason.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' championships have been won on the foundation of the relievers Mariano Rivera, Mike Stanton and Nelson.</p>
        <p>''We made teams open their eyes to how important bullpens are,'' said Nelson, who was patted on the back by Steinbrenner after receiving his key from Giuliani. ''You can't win without a good bullpen. In the playoffs, how often do you want your starter throwing a complete game anyway? What me, Mariano and Stanton have done has helped this team. That would be a pretty hard combination to split up.''</p>
        <p>The players gathered at Yankee Stadium late yesterday morning, signing mountains of memorabilia in their clubhouse, before boarding 18 white-and-black buses with other dignitaries and club employees.</p>
        <p>There was a float reserved for the most valuable player of the World Series, but Derek Jeter preferred to ride with the other infielders, with Tino Martinez and Chuck Knoblauch, all of the players surrounded by friends and family members, and by celebrities.</p>
        <p>Yogi Berra joined the Yankees on the stage in front of City Hall and, after the mayor made presentations, Torre removed his hat and went to the microphone to thank the crowd, ''the best fans in all of baseball, all of the world.'' He congratulated the Mets and seconded Jeter in saying that they were the Yankees' best World Series opponent.</p>
        <p>And he spoke glowingly of his own players. ''I can't say enough about this club,'' Torre said. ''They came back and they would not be denied. I can't say enough about the resolve and the fortitude of this group of men. They may get tired, but they never get tired of winning.''</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte joked that it was good to get through an entire season without being the subject of trade talks. Stanton said he hoped Nelson would be re-signed. And Jeter, who has four championship rings, suggested the fans should enjoy the accomplishments of this team because they might not see another one like it.</p>
        <p>Then Torre called for Cone and O'Neill. O'Neill strode to the microphone, an Ohio native in a full-length leather jacket open to the cold. ''Every year, I go back to the Midwest when this is all said and done,'' he said, ''and people come up to me and say, 'How in the world can you get through New York; how can you live in New York?' But I tell you, after the nine years that I've been here, I walk proud to have a little piece of it that I take home every year. Thank you very, very much.''</p>
        <p>And O'Neill turned and walked away.</p>
