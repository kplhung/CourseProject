        <p>FOR once, everybody had a seat when the music began at Lincoln Center.

        <p>FOR once, everybody had a seat when the music began at Lincoln Center. It was ''Entrance of the Gods Into Valhalla,'' the Wagnerian strain chosen to begin the memorial service for Helen Quinn, also known as the Mighty Quinn, or more often, the Queen of Standees at the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
        <p>For more than three decades she had been the self-appointed ruler of the line for standing-room tickets at the Met, maintaining power solely through the force of ''la voce,'' as her instrument was called during the service on Sunday. It reminded listeners not so much of Callas or Sutherland as of a Marine Corps drill sergeant.</p>
        <p>She could be difficult, as her subjects were quick to point out during the service, which was held in an auditorium overlooking the Met. There were stories of bitter feuds and of opera buffs going home in tears. Miss Quinn liked to say that she loved three things -- opera, horses and dogs -- and it surprised no one that the list did not include human beings.</p>
        <p>''If you don't like the way the line is run,'' she liked to say, ''go home!''</p>
        <p>Miss Quinn lived alone in a little studio on West 57th Street near 10th Avenue (chosen for its proximity to the Met) and did not welcome visitors. Not until her death in August, at the age of 76, did her own relatives get a glimpse of the apartment, which was decorated chiefly with posters of the soprano Mirella Freni and a huge collection of opera LP's.</p>
        <p>''She was fiercely independent,'' said Josephine Rowe, her longtime apprentice and now her successor. ''She was fiercely secretive. If you want to put something on her tombstone, it would be 'I did it my way.' ''</p>
        <p>Starting in 1966, Miss Quinn created a singularly humane way to buy the weekly allotment of standing-room tickets that go on sale each Saturday at 10 a.m. Starting before dawn -- sometimes at 4 a.m., sometimes at midnight if a star like Pavarotti was singing -- she would sit with a clipboard registering the name of each person who appeared.</p>
        <p>Then each person, instead of spending hours in the cold, could go back home or join the other buffs for breakfast at a nearby diner. They would all return at 9 a.m., when Miss Quinn would go down the list and assemble the line. The system eventually gained the tacit approval of the Met, but for many years it depended merely on peer pressure and Miss Quinn.</p>
        <p>''It's not easy running a line, but I'm diligent,'' she observed in 1993. ''I'm deaf, dumb and blind like a fox. I will not tolerate anyone cutting in front. What I do is embarrass them.''</p>
        <p>That she could do, everyone agreed. ''Public humiliation was her specialty,'' said Ms. Rowe. ''I had a 10-year apprenticeship of pain and suffering.'' But Ms. Rowe was one of the many victims who gave grateful testimonials.</p>
        <p>''Helen changed people's lives,'' said Stanton H. Bennett, a former Foreign Service officer. After a career overseas and in Washington, he and his wife decided to move to New York after discovering Miss Quinn and her line during a visit here.</p>
        <p>''As a civilized way to allow someone who's not wealthy to go to the opera, there's nothing like it in the world,'' he said. ''Other houses make you line up in the cold for hours every day, which keeps out anyone's who's not in great health and slightly mad. In Milan, there are all-night lines, and when they open the doors you have to race  against everyone else up five flights of stairs trying to get one of the few good spots.''</p>
        <p>THANKS to the Met's system -- 175 reserved, numbered places for $12 or $16 apiece -- and Miss Quinn's line management, opera addicts could snap up a week's worth of tickets fairly painlessly. In the course of her career Miss Quinn probably spared her fellow citizens close to 200,000 hours of waiting in line.</p>
        <p>''Since when do you have to hang out all night to buy a ticket?'' she said in 1993. ''That's wrong. It's not healthy at all. Standing in line should never be a physical endurance test, because there are all different kinds of persons.''</p>
        <p>Miss Quinn could go on at length about the stupidities of waiting in line -- or the bad behavior of some opera buffs, particularly the Pavarotti fans -- but it was hard to get her to account for her own passion for opera. She became enamored shortly finishing high school and taking a job as a keypunch operator.</p>
        <p>''She just went and fell in love with opera, and she couldn't explain it,'' Ms. Rowe said. ''Sometimes people who have been let down in life look for something that won't let them down, and I think for her that was opera. It was always there. It filled the void.''</p>
