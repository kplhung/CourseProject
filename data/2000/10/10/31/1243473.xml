        <p>New York Chamber Symphony  Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>In just six concerts this season, the New York Chamber Symphony is presenting two world premieres, two New York premieres and a recent work. So give Gerard Schwarz, the ensemble's founding director, credit for mixing a healthy dose of new works into his interestingly varied programs.</p>
        <p>For the first concert of the season on Thursday night, Mr. Schwarz conducted the premiere of Daniel Brewbaker's ''Fields of Vision'' for mezzo-soprano, children's choir and orchestra. The work is a 25-minute setting of texts by 12 writers (11 of them women) from 10 cultures spanning 25 centuries, grouped into eight sections. The work is certainly ambitious in its subject matter, and Mr. Brewbaker has an ear for spiky harmony and a flair for pungent orchestration. Too often, though, the swooning neo-Romantic style of the music plays into the grandiosity of the subject matter, though this is leavened at times by the tuneful writing for children's choir, here the fine Young People's Chorus of New York City. Stacey Rishoi brought her rich mezzo-soprano voice to the solo part.</p>
        <p>Even disappointing new works provide fresh listening experiences. Not so the novelty piece on this program: ''Fantasie Concertante for Piano and Orchestra,'' a transcription by Andy Stein of Schubert's Fantasie in F minor for four-hand piano, which received its premiere. This pointless arrangement was the idea of the soloist, the pianist Andre Watts, who had asked Mr. Stein, a composer of film and television scores, to turn the Schubert's great fantasie into a piano concerto.</p>
        <p>But Schubert's four-hand piano works were intended for two pianists to play at home for their own enjoyment, or at most the enjoyment of a roomful of listeners. Mr. Stein turns this intimate piano piece into an obvious orchestral showstopper. If Mr. Watts is getting tired of his repertory of Romantic piano concertos, he might try asking a living composer to write him something for a change.</p>
        <p>The concert opened with an appealing performance of Brahms's ''Haydn Variations'' and ended with a genial account of Dvorak's ''Czech Suite.''</p>
