        <p>Senator Joseph Lieberman dominates political discussion in Connecticut. His name appears twice on this year's ballots -- as a candidate for re-election to the Senate and as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. Mr. Lieberman's unwise decision to take up two ballot lines should not, however, be allowed to overshadow other important races that deserve equal attention from voters. Here are our endorsements for three especially crucial Congressional races in the state.</p>
        <p>Second District, Eastern Connecticut: During his 20 years in Congress, Representative Sam Gejdenson has faced down a series of formidable challengers, not unlike this year's opponent, Robert Simmons. Mr. Simmons, a Republician, is an articulate state legislator who served as staff director of the Senate intelligence committee and as an operations officer for the C.I.A. in Vietnam. Mr. Simmons's centrist views on some issues, like abortion and the excessive tax cuts proposed by his party, are marred by his opposition to gun control. Moreover, he cannot match Mr. Gejdenson's broad understanding of both local concerns like protecting federal jobs in the district and complex questions of foreign affairs. As the ranking Democrat on the International Relations Committee, Mr. Gejdenson's steady guidance on matters of trade, human rights and other issues has elevated the national debate over global issues. We endorse Mr. Gejdenson.</p>

        <p>Second District, Eastern Connecticut: During his 20 years in Congress, Representative Sam Gejdenson has faced down a series of formidable challengers, not unlike this year's opponent, Robert Simmons. Mr. Simmons, a Republician, is an articulate state legislator who served as staff director of the Senate intelligence committee and as an operations officer for the C.I.A. in Vietnam.

As the ranking Democrat on the International Relations Committee, Mr. Gejdenson's steady guidance on matters of trade, human rights and other issues has elevated the national debate over global issues. We endorse Mr. Gejdenson.</p>
        <p>Fourth District, Southwest Connecticut: If he does nothing else, and he does plenty, the Republican incumbent, Christopher Shays, should be supported for trying to fix the rotting campaign finance system that has turned the 2000 election into a seedy soft-money bazaar. Mr. Shays's Democratic opponent, Stephanie Sanchez, is building a promising record in town politics and environmental issues, but Mr. Shays's work to protect the environment, help veterans and reform the corrupt campaign financing system makes him worthy of enthusiastic support. We endorse Mr. Shays.</p>
        <p>Fifth District, Central Connecticut: In a rematch of one of the closest races in the country two years ago, Representative Jim Maloney, a Democrat, is facing Mark Nielsen, a Republican lawyer and former state legislator. Mr. Nielsen describes himself as a centrist, despite his troubling views on protecting the environment and his vigorous support from the National Rifle Association. And both candidates are trying to attach their names to Mr. Lieberman's. This proved embarrassing for Mr. Nielsen when Dick Cheney, his own party's vice-presidential candidate, came to the state to help Republicans. Mr. Maloney fits more easily with the moderate views of his constituents, notably his strong record on the environment, gun control and education. Mr. Nielsen has once again tried to make an issue of the fact that Mr. Maloney's brother was convicted of campaign finance violations in 1997, but we are more impressed with the congressman's promise to work hard for campaign finance reform. We endorse Mr. Maloney.</p>
