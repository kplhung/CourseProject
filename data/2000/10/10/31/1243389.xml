        <p>A Supreme Court justice, his driver and bodyguard were killed here this morning when a car bomb exploded as the judge's automobile drove along a residential street in the rush hour.</p>
        <p>There was no claim of responsibility, but the attack followed the pattern of the Basque separatist group E.T.A. The attack prompted furious condemnations from politicians.</p>
        <p>Gen. Jose Francisco Querol, 69, a married father of four who was appointed to the military section of the highest court in 1992 and was one month short of retirement, was apparently killed instantly by the blast. The police at the scene said the bomb appeared to have been set off by a remote-control device. Jesus Escudero, the judge's police bodyguard, and Armando Medina, driver of his official car, also died.</p>
        <p>King Juan Carlos condemned the attack, as did most parties and the Basque regional government. ''E.T.A. has carried out a horrible attack in Madrid that has taken the lives of three public servants,'' he said. ''Sooner or later, they will pay for their crimes.''</p>
        <p>The deaths raise the number of killings attributed to the separatist group, whose initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom in Basque, to 19 since it called off a unilateral cease-fire in December. Five people have been killed in October. General Querol is the highest-ranking official slain this year.</p>
        <p>Peace groups called for demonstrations to protest the killings, and the city declared two days of mourning. It is not clear whether the government will do more than continue its policy of a police crackdown on E.T.A. and its supporters. The attacks are aimed at forcing the government to consider E.T.A. demands for independence, supported by perhaps 30 percent of the Basque population, most of whom reject violence.  Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, himself victim of an E.T.A. attack in 1995 a few hundred yards from the bombing today, has made clear many times that he sees the issue not as political, but rather as one of law and order, requiring a firm hand.</p>
        <p>Euskal Herritarrok, a party widely seen as the E.T.A. political wing, said the bombing showed that Spain and France were not able to resolve the Basque problem.</p>
        <p>More than 60 people were treated for injuries today. One, a bus driver, was badly injured.</p>
