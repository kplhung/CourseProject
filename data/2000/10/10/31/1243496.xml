        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was thrilled to receive documentation for what I have experienced (''One-Two Punch for Losing Pounds: Exercise and Careful Diet,'' Oct. 17). Through exercise and eating well, I have been able to maintain my weight. Regular exercise allows for an occasional dessert splurge. Or if you have gone through an excessive period, make sure to run an extra mile or so. As a pastry chef, I know you don't have to totally give up desserts.</p>
