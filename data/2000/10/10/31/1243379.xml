        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average registered its biggest one-day gain in six months yesterday, as investors plowed money into blue-chip issues and sold highly priced technology shares.</p>
        <p>Cyclical stocks like Alcoa, International Paper and DuPont led the Dow's advance, but the breadth of the rise in the index was impressive: 26 of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow average rose in price yesterday, while 4 posted declines.</p>
        <p>By the close, the Dow was up 245.15 points, or 2.3 percent, to 10,835.77. It was the seventh gain in the last eight sessions. Yesterday's advance was the biggest since April 17.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of stocks that make up the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also moved higher. The S.&amp; P. 500 closed at 1,398.66, up 19.08 points, or 1.4 percent. More than 400 stocks in the index rose in price. Financial stocks, led by the American International Group, drug stocks like Abbott Labs and regional telephone companies like SBC Communications, BellSouth and Verizon Communications did well.</p>
        <p>''The Dow stocks are probably getting a little bit overbought, but the S.&amp; P. stocks are not and the Nasdaq composite index is very oversold,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen. Yesterday was a ''pretty broad-based, explosive rally.''</p>
        <p>A cautious assessment of the prospects for Cisco Systems, a Nasdaq stalwart, was a major catalyst behind yesterday's drop in the Nasdaq composite index. The index closed at 3,191.40, down 86.96 points, or 2.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Cisco, which was the most actively traded stock yesterday, fell $2.63, to $48.06, after an analyst at Lehman Brothers said the shares would not rise as much as he previously forecast.</p>
        <p>Worries about Cisco spilled over into shares of fiber optic equipment makers. Those stocks were under pressure last week after Nortel Networks released revenue figures that fell short of Wall Street's rosiest expectations.</p>
        <p>''The real story is the rotation out of technology,'' said Phil Roth, chief technical market analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''Stocks that were sacred cows are getting hammered.''</p>
        <p>From their March peak, Cisco shares have fallen 40 percent. Even with the decline, the stock still trades at 64 times its projected earnings.</p>
        <p>Cisco pulled down a lot of other technology stocks with lofty price-to-earnings ratios.</p>
        <p>Juniper Networks, which sells for 355 times projected earnings, slid $14.63, to $166.38. Applied Micro Circuits fell $13.25, to $128.13. Sycamore Networks lost $9, to $56.13. Ciena dropped $13.69, to $90.69. And JDS Uniphase fell $5.94, to $71.31.</p>
        <p>By contrast, it was a good day for so-called old-economy stocks. Alcoa gained $3.44, to $28.44. International Paper rose $2.50, to $35.75. And DuPont rose $4, to $45.</p>
        <p>''It looks like the market is starting to bottom after its decline in September and earlier this month,'' said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>''The initial buying is in the value stocks, but we should get some sort of catch-up in the Nasdaq. Historically, the November-through-January period is the strongest three months of the year.''</p>
