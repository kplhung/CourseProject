        <p>In his 28 years representing northeast Queens in the State Senate, Frank Padavan has had his share of tough re-election fights.</p>
        <p>''When you're in a district where only one of every four voters is a member of your party,'' he said during an interview in his district office, ''it's always a tough race.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In his 28 years representing northeast Queens in the State Senate, Frank Padavan has had his share of tough re-election fights.</p>
        <p>''When you're in a district where only one of every four voters is a member of your party,'' he said during an interview in his district office, ''it's always a tough race.''</p>
        <p>But many of Mr. Padavan's fellow Republicans, as well as more than a few Democratic officials in New York, say that this year, Mr. Padavan, 65, faces a formidable challenge. His opponent, Rory Lancman, a lawyer and a member of Community Board 8, is waging an energetic, well-financed campaign in which he stresses his support for more state financing for public schools in New ork City and more affordable health care for the elderly and immigrants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancman, 31, has sought to depict Mr. Padavan as too conservative and out of touch with voters in the 11th District, a swath of communities from Douglaston and Little Neck to Bellerose and Queens Village that often seem more suburban than part of New York City.</p>
        <p>The race is being closely watched by officials of both parties because it is one of several State Senate contests in which the incumbent is considered vulnerable. In the Senate, Republicans hold a six-seat majority, which the Democrats are eager to whittle down or end.</p>
        <p>Mr. Padavan has been actively campaigning, meeting with civic and community groups and sending residents a stream of campaign literature stressing his sponsorship of last year's ban on assault weapons, his support for rent-stabilization laws and his periodic clashes with the Republican leadership in Albany on how much money to earmark for New York City.</p>
        <p>''I fought for money for the schools,'' Mr. Padavan said. ''I'm the one who funded prekindergarten programs. I've fought for health care, especially for seniors.''</p>
        <p>He criticized his opponent for having moved into the district a year before the election and for taking undue credit for preventing a hospital from being privatized. ''I think that the borough president and others had something to do with that, too,'' Mr. Padavan said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancman and his fellow Democrats, meanwhile, say they are encouraged by several signs, especially that he has raised about $150,000, a significant amount for a first-time candidate for a legislative office. And Mr. Lancman said the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee was likely to spend another $100,000 or so.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are further buoyed by the presence of Al Gore on the top of the party's ticket. And they contend that Mr. Lancman will benefit from the lopsided advantage Democrats have in registrations: 53 percent of the district's voters are Democrats compared with the 23 percent who are registered Republicans.</p>
        <p>That advantage in registrations is what many Queens politicians suggest contributed to the 41 percent of the vote garnered by Mr. Padavan's 1998 opponent, Morshed Alam, an environmental chemist for the city who spent less than $25,000 in his campaign against the incumbent senator.</p>
        <p>''He has a reputation for delivering a certain amount of pork to the district, which gives the impression that he is a moderate on education,'' Mr. Lancman said of Mr. Padavan. ''But he goes up to Albany and votes with Joe Bruno to shortchange New York City schools,'' he added, referring to the Senate majority leader.</p>
        <p>''I can win because people care about the issues that I am talking about: education and health care,'' Mr. Lancman said. ''And every day more and more people are enrolling in this district and identifying themselves as Democrats. And Senator Padavan does not have a good Albany record on those issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancman says his most notable credential is the role he played, as a member of the Queens Hospital Center directors, in thwarting an effort by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to privatize the public hospital.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Padavan comes across like the experienced, seasoned politician, Mr. Lancman seems more like the exuberant student body president.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Lancman, who stresses that he is a lifelong Queens resident, became involved in politics as a teenager when he worked as an intern for Representative Gary L. Ackerman. He was appointed to Community Board 8 at age 21 and became active in Democratic Party clubs in Queens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancman's cramped campaign headquarters is filled with young volunteers. He has taken to campaigning in an old school bus that he painted neon green.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Mr. Padavan has developed a reputation as one of the Legislature's most ornery members, known for refusing to speak to his Republican colleagues for some time after they failed to support his bills. Some of his fellow Republicans suggest that he can be dismissive, sarcastic and condescending.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Padavan is known as an independent Republican whose political views do not lend themselves to easy classification. He is a champion of tough criminal penalties and has sponsored and supported bills on gun control, including a ban on assault weapons. He generally opposes abortion and is considered a fiscal conservative who has also supported increases in spending on preschools and mental health programs.</p>
        <p>The district has many communities that have a suburban feel to them, particularly in the neighborhoods along the Nassau County line, with large, single-family homes with lawns. The district's population is overwhelmingly white, with many residents of Italian or Irish descent. In the last several years, the area has also become a magnet for immigrants, many from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other Asian countries. The district voted to re-elect President Clinton in 1996 and Mayor  Giuliani the following year.</p>
