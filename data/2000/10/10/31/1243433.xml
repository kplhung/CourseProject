        <p>Gov. George W. Bush hurtled today into the stretch run of the presidential race, making a high-profile visit to California instead of the more closely contested states in the Midwest and portraying his opponent as a man who practices the ''politics of division.''</p>
        <p>Casting an aura of confidence, Mr. Bush insisted that his decision to spend some of the last days of the campaign in a state that has been a cornerstone of the last two Democratic presidential victories would pay off with an upset here.</p>
        <p>''I tell you, there are going to be a lot of shocked people on Nov. 7 -- starting with my opponent,'' Mr. Bush told a delighted crowd in a hotel ballroom here. He said political experts who had labeled the state as safely in Vice President Al Gore's column ''don't understand what's happening in California.''</p>
        <p>''The pundits, like my opponent, have taken California for granted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As the audience roared, Mr. Bush proclaimed, ''We're going to send a message to the rest of the country: California is back.''</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Bush's rival in the primaries, stood with him on the stage, trying to bring the independents and swing voters who had once flocked to him to the Republican ticket. ''California's going to be blessed by the presence of the vice president of the United States tomorrow,'' Mr. McCain said, drawing playful boos from the crowd. ''We don't want to say that,'' he told the audience. ''We want to say Mr. Vice President, welcome to Bush country.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush ventured onto Democratic turf, Mr. Gore spent the day trying to shore up support in the Midwest, telling voters in Wisconsin that he would ''give democracy back to you'' and pledging to hold an open meeting every week with ordinary citizens if he is elected. [Page A21.]</p>
        <p>All through the day, Mr. Bush broadly summed up the rationale for his election, portraying himself as a uniter who would ''bring America together'' to deal with the problems facing Social Security, Medicare and struggling schools. ''Our country has unlimited potential,'' Mr. Bush told a crowd of several thousand in an airport hangar in Albuquerque, where he stopped on his way to the West Coast. ''But our politics is broken -- at least in Washington.</p>
        <p>''You know what's wrong,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Washington is obsessed with scoring points, not solving problems. There is so much anger, so much division, so much important work left undone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's insistence that ''we can aim higher, we can do better'' was designed to contrast with the Democrats' end-of-campaign attacks on his record in Texas and his relative inexperience in national politics. Yet even as he pledged to ''inspire and unite,'' the Republican presidential nominee took withering aim at Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush described his opponent as a defender of the status quo, who was sowing cynicism and was afraid to lead, or to grapple with the looming financial difficulties of the federal programs for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''Surely the vice president can see these problems,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And yet he will not act. He is surrounded and supported by interest groups that exist to oppose reform. He seems guided by polls and focus groups that drain politics of its courage.''</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Gore's ''big government ideas'' were ''out of touch with our time and out of step with the American people.'' Building to a crescendo, Mr. Bush went on: ''My opponent cannot bring America together because he practices the politics of division. He talks of ripping the lungs out of political opponents. He scares the elderly for political gain. His campaign attacks are designed to spread falsehood and cynicism.''</p>
        <p>His supporters cheered and many of them held up three fingers for W, Mr. Bush's middle initial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush portrayed himself as a farsighted leader who would not shy away from fixing programs like Medicare and Social Security, which could run out of money in coming decades, and would change the lack of quality in some of the nation's public schools. ''Should I be elected president, I'm going to confront the hard issues,'' he said, ''from the inertia of our education bureaucracy to the third rail of Social Security. I won't take the easy way, the Washington way. I will act. And I will lead.''</p>
        <p>Even with most national polls showing Mr. Bush with a small lead, the Republican's decision to spend two of the final days of the race in California was not without risk. This is when a candidate's time is most precious, and appearances normally are carefully chosen for where they can do most good. And while several recent polls suggest that California is more competitive than expected, Mr. Gore is still holding leads ranging from 5 to 10 percentage points.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush has refused to give up on the nation's most populous state the way his father did in 1992 and Bob Dole did four years later.  ''The time for head fakes are long past,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director. ''We're serious.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's stop in Burbank was built around a taping of the ''Tonight'' show with Jay Leno. At one point in the show, Mr. Leno donned a Bush mask and mispronounced the word ''subliminal.'' Mr. Bush promptly put on a Gore mask and said, ''This is more scary.''</p>
        <p>After the show, Mr. Bush went to Fresno, Calif., to try to generate enthusiasm among Republicans in the  Central Valley, a swing area. Mr. Bush also planned to sweep up the West Coast, through Oregon and Washington, where Democrats have prevailed in recent elections, before heading back to the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Polls show the race nearly even in Washington and Oregon as Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, has drawn the support of a number of voters who might otherwise be expected to lean toward a Democrat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, too, was to arrive here on Tuesday to appear on the ''Tonight'' show, and his aides dismissed Mr. Bush's challenge. ''We welcome Governor Bush to spend as much of his time and money in California as he wants,'' said Kym Spell, a Gore spokeswoman, ''because we feel very confident about where we stand on issues like the environment that are important to California.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton is also expected to campaign for Democratic Congressional candidates here this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's speech in New Mexico was unusually long for a rally address and it summed up his closing appeal to voters, just eight days before the election. He painted himself as the antidote to politics as usual, and he drew contrasts with Mr. Gore on a range of issues, including education, Social Security, Medicare, tax cutting and the military.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush read the speech from a teleprompter, but that did not stop him from making a mistake and inverting his words. At one point, he thundered that Mr. Gore believes that the federal surplus ''is the people's money.'' He meant to say that Mr. Gore considers the surplus the ''government's money.''</p>
        <p>But he took his mix-up in stride and paraphrased Ronald Reagan to laugh at himself. ''Excuse me,'' he said, ''There I go again,'' and the crowd lapped it up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said that every day in this final week, Mr. Bush would highlight a particular theme of his campaign and today's was supposed to be education. But his off-the-cuff remarks at the Bosque Farms, N.M., elementary school were little more than a perfunctory rendition of his views on an issue on which he has run hard all year.</p>
        <p>At one point Mr. Bush appeared to be answering criticisms that Texas schools have put too much emphasis on preparing for standardized testing, compared with more meaningful instruction. ''I know you hear all the time about, well, you can't have accountability because teachers will teach to a test,'' he said. ''Here's my answer. Teaching a child to read, teaching a child to comprehend is not teaching to a test.''</p>
