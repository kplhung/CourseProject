        <p>Navy ships have been ordered to avoid the Suez Canal since the bombing of the destroyer Cole, out of fear of another terrorist attack, senior defense officials said tonight.</p>
        <p>No Navy ship has passed through the canal since Oct. 12,  when terrorists blasted a hole in the Cole, killing 17 sailors, while it refueled in the port of Aden.</p>
        <p>''The threat is clearly very high right now,'' a defense official said.</p>
        <p>''It's not a single threat but if you can make do without incurring the additional risk, you do so.''</p>
        <p>The prohibition against passing through the canal was first reported on CNN.</p>
        <p>While the Pentagon continued to take increased security measures in the Persian Gulf region, President Clinton said today that he had spoken to President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president of Yemen, and asked his help in the joint investigation with the F.B.I.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Clinton sent the Yemeni leader a confidential letter asking for broader cooperation in the investigation and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh, issued a public appeal in Washington for access to witnesses and suspects held by Yemeni authorities.</p>
        <p>''What I argued to President Saleh was that we ought to have a genuine joint investigation,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''All I can tell you is we're working very hard and I'm quite hopeful.''</p>
        <p>[The investigation is focused on Osama bin Laden, but no evidence has yet been found directly linking him to the attack, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said in a speech at Ohio State University in Columbus, The Associated Press reported. ''We are looking very closely at Osama bin Laden to see whether or not he in fact or organizations he supports are in some way connected,'' Mr. Cohen said.]</p>
        <p>The ban against the use of the Suez Canal has forced the Navy to adjust its operational schedules but to date this has not led to any major rerouting of ships from the Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf or the Sixth Fleet, which operates in the Mediterranean, according to a defense official. ''So far no ship has had to transit back across the Mediterranean and go around Africa,'' said one official. ''But that can't go on forever.''</p>
        <p>The Blue Marlin, the enormous Norwegian transport ship that  will carry the Cole home for repairs, has been ordered to head south from Aden around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope, avoiding the Suez Canal.</p>
        <p>Several defense officials said that while Egypt has an excellent record for providing security at the Suez Canal, the Pentagon decided ships were too vulnerable in the narrow canal. ''The Egyptians take security very seriously but we have to assess the situation on a continual basis,'' said the defense official.</p>
        <p>All ships in the Fifth Fleet were ordered out of port after the attack on the Cole and remain at sea.</p>
