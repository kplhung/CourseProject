        <p>Working in the Brooklyn South narcotics unit of the Police Department, Detective Edward Murphy has heard his share of lame excuses and bold lies. But few top the ones he took in at the Yankee parade as he manned a police barricade at Reade and Church Streets, where he and his co-workers kept latecomers from trying to cross over to Broadway to see the parade.</p>
        <p>It was just crowd control. Not his fault. But still he was hectored and fibbed to by brokenhearted fans looking to sneak past him.</p>

        <p>Working in the Brooklyn South narcotics unit of the Police Department, Detective Edward Murphy has heard his share of lame excuses and bold lies. But few top the ones he took in at the Yankee parade as he manned a police barricade at Reade and Church Streets, where he and his co-workers kept latecomers from trying to cross over to Broadway to see the parade.</p>
        <p>It was just crowd control. Not his fault. But still he was hectored and fibbed to by brokenhearted fans looking to sneak past him.</p>
        <p>One man said he owned a video store in the middle of the block, and when Detective Murphy offered to escort him there, the man suddenly recalled that he was busy. ''You can't believe the excuses I hear,'' Detective Murphy said. '' 'I lost my 4-year-old sister,' 'I live across the street,' -- like they live in City Hall --  'I'm Irish Catholic,' that was the best one I heard all day.''</p>
        <p>A group of teenage girls could not be dissuaded. One, sporting braces, sparkly lavender eye shadow and a pair of Winnie-the-Pooh mittens, begged, whined, offered a modest bribe and flirted with the detective, all in the hope that she could get a glimpse of Derek Jeter. ''I'll let you go if you can tell me whose face is on a $50 bill,'' Detective Murphy offered. Eye-shadow girl just giggled.</p>
        <p>''We came all the way from Poughkeepsie, Long Island,'' insisted one young man. The detective could only roll his eyes. ''Imagine doing this for four hours,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At one point, the barricade had to be moved to accommodate a police bus. The teenage girls quickly assessed their chances to make a break for it. Not missing a beat, Detective Murphy warned them: ''I am 6 foot 2 and I run like a gazelle.''</p>
        <p>Quick notes on the detective: he is 28, recently married, lives in Staten Island and loves his job. He does not mind parades and has been known to be a little lenient with nice fans. ''I can be open to excuses,'' he admitted. ''Don't write that down.''</p>
