        <p>Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanian who led his people on a 10-year campaign of peaceful protest for independence from Serbia, was confirmed today as the winner of the elections held on Saturday. His party won 21 of 27 contested municipalities.</p>
        <p>With close to 90 percent of votes counted, international election organizers released preliminary results showing Mr. Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, with 58 percent of the votes and the former guerrilla leader Hashim Thaci with 27 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thaci, who was political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army before he turned to politics last year after the NATO bombing campaign to drive Serbian forces from the province, won six municipalities. Another rebel commander, Ramush Haradinaj, took about 7 percent. Turnout was close to 80 percent; three municipalities in northern Kosovo populated only by Serbs did not take part in the elections.</p>
        <p>Louis Sell, of the International Crisis Group, an independent research organization, said the results indicated that Kosovo Albanians had voted for stability and the father figure of Mr. Rugova, an intellectual and professor who led a campaign of passive resistance through the 1990's against the government of Slobodan Milosevic. It was also a vote against Mr. Thaci, Mr. Sell said, and the violence associated with many Thaci supporters.</p>
        <p>Despite his clear disappointment, Mr. Thaci said today that he would accept the election's outcome and promised to work together with other parties in sharing power in the local councils, and to continue to work for the people and prepare for general elections next year.</p>
        <p>''I want to assure the citizens of Kosovo that we are here to continue to work for an independent and democratic Kosovo,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That Kosovo was able, for the first time, to hold free and democratic elections was a victory for the Kosovo Liberation Army, he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the results represent a blow to Mr. Thaci, 30, who has played the leading role in Kosovo politics since he emerged into public view last year as the political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and headed the negotiation team at peace talks with Serbian officials in Rambouillet, France.</p>
        <p>After the NATO bombing campaign ended last June and peacekeeping troops entered Kosovo, Mr. Thaci and his fellow commanders quickly set up their own provisional government and took charge in all 27 of the Albanian-dominated municipalities.</p>
        <p>Although the United Nations administration, which is charged with running the province, has gradually established its power in the territory, Mr. Thaci and his supporters continued to dominate local affairs. Now they will have to relinquish both offices and power in many areas.</p>
        <p>While the newly elected councils will not wield much power, they will have responsibility for education, transport, health care and other local services as part of the United Nations plan to develop Kosovo into a self-governing territory.</p>
        <p>The poll is being seen as an indication of how a general election for a national leader, which could take place by the middle of next year, would proceed. What that means for negotiations on Kosovo's final status is unclear. Mr. Rugova may appear to be more moderate than Mr. Thaci, but he has stubbornly held out for independence for a decade and his first comments on claiming victory on Sunday were to call for immediate independence from Yugoslavia.</p>
