        <p>Surprise is not on the menu of ''Borscht Belt Buffet on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Anyone who enters Town Hall, where this show is playing through Nov. 6, knows exactly what is being served up: old-fashioned fare, drenched in nostalgia. Some songs, some patter, a little hoofing, a bunch of jokes, all delivered by polished professionals.</p>

        <p>Surprise is not on the menu of ''Borscht Belt Buffet on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Anyone who enters Town Hall, where this show is playing through Nov. 6, knows exactly what is being served up: old-fashioned fare, drenched in nostalgia. Some songs, some patter, a little hoofing, a bunch of jokes, all delivered by polished professionals.</p>
        <p>This ''Borscht'' is sometimes corny, sometimes schmaltzy, sometimes an upbeat treat.</p>
        <p>Like borscht, the show is nonalcoholic, so a high cannot be expected, only the comfort of knowing that for a generation that is passing into history, entertainment built around a common heritage is still to be found.</p>
        <p>Here are evocations of stars of yesteryear like Menasha Skulnik and Eddie Cantor, Jewish theater on Second Avenue, the heyday of the Catskill Mountain resorts, the joys of Yiddish, the glories of Broadway and the anguish of parents with boys in the Army, as well as jokes about retirement in Florida and the entropy of romance in long marriages.</p>
        <p>So while ''Borscht Belt Buffet on Broadway'' can be derided as the equivalent of vaudeville for the geriatric set, it can also be cherished as a loving memorial, though scarcely a work of art.</p>
        <p>With Dan Siretta as the director and choreographer, the three stars -- Bruce Adler, David (Dudu) Fisher and Mal Z. Lawrence -- are backed by a band as they perform, occasionally together but mainly as a succession of individual acts, each lasting 40 minutes or so.</p>
        <p>As the leadoff man, Mr. Adler, who comes from a line of Yiddish theater actors, offers an East Side, West Side, all around the town time-machine tour that winds from Broadway to Second Avenue and back, in an energetic display of singing, dancing and joking that resurrects everyone from Al Jolson, Bert Lahr and Danny Kaye to, incongruously, Sammy Davis Jr. and Gene Kelly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher, whose career has taken him from operatic training and cantorial singing to the stage as Jean Valjean in ''Les Miserables,'' works in English, Yiddish and Hebrew in a display of big voice and big sentiment that recycles the Broadway songs, operatic parodies and liturgical material used in New York only last year in his one-man show ''Never on Friday'' at the Jewish Repertory Theater.</p>
        <p>Last but far from least is the ever enjoyable Mr. Lawrence, revisiting the kind of comic territory that so richly entertained audiences who saw him in ''Catskills on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Pronouncing himself thrilled to be on West 43rd Street at the height of the off-season, Mr. Lawrence is soon running through topics like doddering security guards in Florida, gambling in Atlantic City, meals in Catskills resorts, old age and the effects of marriage on behavior.</p>
        <p>The audience exits smiling.</p>
