        <p>It was cold, the night temperature dipping into the 30's, and it was dark when Neil Drysdale led him from Barn 41 at Churchill Downs onto the almost empty stage where the colt reigns as the star of the Breeders' Cup.</p>
        <p>He was Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Kentucky Derby and the solid favorite to make his final performance on Saturday a winning one in the $4 million Classic against 13 of the world's best racehorses. With Andy Durnin in the saddle for his last workout Sunday morning, he shot seven-eighths of a mile in 1:27 4/5, exploding in the homestretch the way he did in the Wood Memorial, the Derby and the Jerome Handicap.</p>
        <p>Pegasus seemed to answer the doubters who have wondered if he would ever race again after minor foot injuries forced him to be withdrawn from the $1 million Belmont Stakes in June and the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup in October. After all, he was being syndicated for $60 million as a stallion, so his future value looked safe.</p>
        <p>But even the suspicion surrounding him was major stuff as racing opened its week of championship events: 135 horses from Europe and North and South America running eight races cumulatively worth $18 million. As the week opened at Churchill Downs in cool sunshine, a flight from Europe landed in Louisville this morning carrying nine Breeders' Cup contenders, led by Montjeu, winner of last year's Arc de Triomphe.</p>
        <p>In its 17 years, the Breeders' Cup has survived bad weather, upsets on the track and injuries to celebrity horses. But now it seemed to be a pot of gold surrounded by all sorts of buzz about the leading man in the show, Fusaichi Pegasus. The doubts were fed by the terse, seemingly evasive manner of his understated English trainer, who said after the workout: ''It was a nice trot.''</p>
        <p>''But that's why we are here,'' Drysdale said. ''In all seriousness, the work went as planned, and he did it well. He appears to be coming up to the race well.''</p>
        <p>Racing people knew that Pegasus was royally bred, a son of Mr. Prospector and grandson of Danzig, and that he had been bought as a yearling for $4 million by Fusao Sekiguchi of Tokyo. He raced once at 2, losing by a head at Hollywood Park. This year, at 3, he raced into prominence, capturing the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and, three weeks later, the Kentucky Derby here at Churchill Downs.</p>
        <p>But two weeks later, just when he was being touted as the Horse of the Year and maybe the horse of the decade, he was outrun by Red Bullet in the Preakness. A foot injury kept him from running in the Belmont or anywhere else for four months, while Drysdale kept fending with statements such as: ''He's doing fine.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in his absence, other colts like Lemon Drop Kid and Albert the Great developed into winners, and they will also be in the starting gate on Saturday when the full field of 14 horses arrives at the post for the Classic. The question lingered: Could a horse defeat world-class competition at a mile and a quarter after racing once in five months and working out sparingly?</p>
        <p>''He hasn't trained that much,'' said Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Lemon Drop Kid, ''So, if he wins the Classic, you'd have to say that Drysdale is a magician.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale, the son of a British Army officer and the very model of a model English horseman, gave the impression at dinner Sunday night of a man at peace with himself and oblivious to the fuss he had created. He talked about English literature, French food and American films. But he was up before dawn this morning, supervising the program he had plotted for Pegasus for the day after his final workout: taking life easy, just walking under the shed row.</p>
        <p>''He looks well,'' Drysdale said, ''and will just gallop up to the race. Coming into the Kentucky Derby, he never missed a beat. Here, he did have to miss a few days for the foot to heal. But it's healed completely.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the time missed will affect him. He's a remarkable horse, a very athletic horse, and he ran a remarkable race in the Derby. He has worked easily and is well within himself. He has a lot of charisma. He's quite rambunctious in the morning. He likes to go at his speed. He likes to be in charge.''</p>
        <p>One of his rivals who also likes to be in charge, Albert the Great, worked five-eighths of a mile this morning in a pedestrian 1:05 4/5, prompting his trainer, Nick Zito, to wax philosophic. ''What is time?'' Zito asked. ''I know there are a lot of people who are going to say how slow his work was. What can I tell you? Once you get them this far, you have to get them over there happy and healthy.''</p>
        <p>And Schulhofer, riled by people who thought Lemon Drop Kid was showing signs of wear, said: ''People keep talking about Drysdale's horse, but I don't see it. I'd like to have all the money they bet on Albert the Great, too. I think you can get a good price on my horse, and I think he'll run well.''</p>
