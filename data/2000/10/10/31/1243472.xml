        <p>Minnesota Orchestra  Carnegie Hall</p>
        <p>When Eiji Oue, then little known, arrived as music director of the Minnesota Orchestra in 1995 on a wave of Barnumesque publicity, you had to hope that he was an unwitting victim of bad management. But on Saturday evening, with Mr. Oue now scheduled to leave the post in 2002, it began to look as though showmanship would be a salient part of his legacy.</p>
        <p>It can be innocent enough, as when -- whether bothered by a malfunctioning clip on the vest of his formal wear or simply wanting to show the Gypsy in his soul -- Mr. Oue did an elaborate bit of striptease on his way to the podium for the encore, Brahms's Fifth Hungarian Dance. Yet it can also damage the music, as when Mr. Oue had the French horns stand for the peroration of Mahler's First Symphony.</p>
        <p>The Mahler performance had to that point produced exciting moments, rising out of arid stretches, and finally seemed headed toward a solid, satisfying conclusion. But musically, the visual effect of unseating the horns came as mere distraction; if Mr. Oue wanted more sound, the horn players had only to redirect their bells. And it became clear in another grandstand play, as Mr. Oue raced to the close, that he was after more: cheap thrills, and the standing ovation sure to follow.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23, with Andreas Haefliger as a mostly deft soloist, had emerged mellifluously -- how could it not? -- though without strong rhythmic profile. Lapses in togetherness were small but many, and Mr. Oue must share the blame, for even without the pianist, fast-moving phrases from one part of the orchestra sometimes butted against sluggish ones from another.</p>
        <p>The concert opened with Webern's ''Im Sommerwind,'' a work from 1904 that suggests what Webern might have become had he not taken  up with Schoenberg: Zemlinsky, more or less. Many in the audience, undoubtedly fearing the spare later Webern, arrived late.</p>
