        <p>A $512 million formal settlement of the class-action lawsuit against Sotheby's and Christie's lays out for the first time how the proceeds are to be divided among the more than 100,000 customers who said they were cheated by price-fixing and other collusion by the auction houses, according to Sotheby's court papers.</p>
        <p>The settlement, awaited since Sept. 22 and filed Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, provides for the money -- minus unspecified lawyers' fees and administrative expenses -- to be distributed ''pro rata based upon each class member's alleged overcharges'' on domestic transactions. The calculations would take into account sellers' commissions paid on auction sales from Sept. 1, 1997, through Feb. 7, 2000, and purchase fees paid by buyers from Jan. 1, 1993, through Feb. 7, 2000.</p>

        <p>A $512 million formal settlement of the class-action lawsuit against Sotheby's and Christie's lays out for the first time how the proceeds are to be divided among the more than 100,000 customers who said they were cheated by price-fixing and other collusion by the auction houses, according to Sotheby's court papers.</p>
        <p>The settlement, awaited since Sept. 22 and filed Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, provides for the money -- minus unspecified lawyers' fees and administrative expenses -- to be distributed ''pro rata based upon each class member's alleged overcharges'' on domestic transactions. The calculations would take into account sellers' commissions paid on auction sales from Sept. 1, 1997, through Feb. 7, 2000, and purchase fees paid by buyers from Jan. 1, 1993, through Feb. 7, 2000.</p>
        <p>About 80 percent of the disbursements would be in cash, the agreement specifies, with the remaining 20 percent in the form of discount certificates to offset the price of seller's commissions and certain other charges. The certificates will be good for at least five years and could be turned into other credits.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement, $100 million of each company's $256 million will be distributed within 30 days of preliminary approval of the settlement by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, and an additional $106 million will be distributed within 30 days of the judge's final approval. Also within 30 days of final approval, each company will offer customers covered by the case $50 million in the form of the seller's discount certificates.</p>
        <p>Customers covered under the class action can still opt out of the settlement, and if too many do so -- the number is not being made public -- Sotheby's and Christie's could pull out of the agreement.</p>
        <p>A Christie's spokesman said the Christie's settlement had also been given to the judge, but the auction house declined to make the papers available. Lawyers said that both sets of papers were generally comparable, although in Sotheby's case, $156 million of the $256 million is to be contributed by its former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, as part of his settlement with the company.</p>
        <p>THE MARKETS  Correction:  November 1, 2000, Wednesday  An article in Business Day yesterday about plans to divide the proceeds of a $512 million settlement among auction customers in the class action antitrust suit against Sotheby's and Christie's misstated the starting date for calculating overcharges and the timetable for distribution of the money. The starting date is Sept. 1, 1995, not 1997. Within 30 days of preliminary and final approval by the federal court, the money will be deposited in stages in an escrow account, not distributed directly.</p>
