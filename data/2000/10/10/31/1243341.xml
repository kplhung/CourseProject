        <p>''A Place at the Table,'' a new play imported from London, where it was first produced earlier this year, has the sophisticated gloss of British satires best exemplified by Tom Stoppard's ''Real Thing.'' The playwright, Simon Block, has provided rapid-fire dialogue that relishes wordplay, ambitious characters bent on self-justification in morally ambiguous circumstances, and a contemporary setting that stirs together the elements of art, the media and commerce into arch social critique.</p>
        <p>It's a cocky formula, in which a writer declares the riskiness and importance of his own enterprise, and the revival of Mr. Stoppard's play last year on Broadway illustrated what is required to pull it off: original wit brought to an original and credible situation. Mr. Block, however, has lesser gifts, and they are aimed at well-worn targets: the poor quality of television sitcoms and the insidious seduction of selling out.</p>
        <p>A former television writer himself, he has mounted an all-out attack on the medium here -- television is more a business than an art; did you know? -- complete with a number of bitter comic asides about the relegation of theater to the cultural fringe. But his play, at the MCC Theater on West 28th Street in Chelsea, is rarely as savage or funny as it presumes to be, and it is logically suspect as well.</p>
        <p>The play takes place in the conference room of a small television production company in London, where a new boss (who is never seen) has imposed a mandate for groundbreaking shows and has already trimmed his staff of those who can't fulfill it. Fearful for her job, Sarah, a script editor (we know she's tense from her anti-smoking patch) has summoned a young playwright (the author of one produced play, written, as he says, for ''the theater's marginal voices season'') to ask him to create a new sitcom.</p>
        <p>His play was about a paraplegic. Adam, the playwright, is himself in a wheelchair most of the time (he has a muscle disease known as Becker's dystrophy), and the comedy Sarah wants him to create is about the disabled.</p>
        <p>This would seem like a pretty good idea, no? And a shrewd match of writer and subject by an experienced television executive, if a gamble on an unproven talent. But the first act of the play treats the concept of the show as shocking and Sarah's proposal as a cynical attempt to exploit Adam's disability and compromise him as a writer.</p>
        <p>In a throat-clearing prelude, Rachel, the office gofer, condescends to Adam with dimwitted self-consciousness. Sammy, another gofer who is also a conniving, aspiring writer himself, speaks ill of Sarah behind her back. And when Sarah finally gets around to the business at hand, she and Adam engage in an immediately heated discussion of her motives. This consists of Sarah's passionate defense of television's potential and Adam's passionate defense of the disabled as people with an ordinary, fundamental humanity. He can only see Sarah's idea of the show as a palliative that would make able-bodied viewers rest easier with their guilty good fortune. He won't do it.</p>
        <p>''Anything with bubbles artificially added is automatically suspect in my book,'' he says, declining sparkling water in favor of still. Hint: that's a metaphor.</p>
        <p>The actors here, under the direction of Michael Sexton, do pretty well, considering the ardent posturing of their characters; for one thing, Americans all, their English accents are quite sonorous. For another, they buff the sheen of their assigned personalities to a persuasive bright glow. As Sarah, Robin Weigert manages her alleged hypocrisy -- she's just doing her job, after all -- with the slick elan of well-coiffed news anchor. As Adam, Zak Orth does a nice job conveying the character's mix of juvenile and adult pride, and the scenes in which he struggles to walk are accomplished without overextending the pathos that really would offend the disabled.</p>
        <p>They are hamstrung, however, by a script that pulls them in the direction of theme and away from consistent characters with common sense. Supposedly intelligent and thoughtful, neither Adam nor Sarah seems capable of addressing their situation with the mutual complicity of adults talking about working together.</p>
        <p>Of course, Adam changes his mind about the sitcom he had no reason to scoff at in the first place; it takes a hokey self-revelation, accompanied by a standard delusion (he imagines himself making an award acceptance speech) to do it. And the second act is about what happens when he writes a brilliant six-episode series and submits it, its excellence bringing greater frustration and consternation upon everyone concerned.</p>
        <p>The climactic confrontation, with everyone screaming and Adam in tears, causes them such agony that you would think lives had been sacrificed. Or at least that Sarah has made a Faustian bargain that marks the condemnation of culture, and that a 28-year-old playwright with a sheaf of laudatory reviews has had his future canceled. (In the age of cable, the arguments made here that his show is unsuitable for broadcast by any station are simply outdated.) Perhaps this is meant as sardonic hyperbole, but it feels more like daytime television.</p>
