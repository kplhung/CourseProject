        <p>While more than half the Rangers fanned out over the metropolitan area to visit primary schools yesterday, Valery Kamensky was at the doctor's office, where X-rays showed he has a bruised kidney.</p>
        <p>That diagnosis means Kamensky, who sustained the injury during the Rangers' 5-1 rout of the Boston Bruins on Sunday night, will probably miss tomorrow night's game against Tampa Bay and Thursday night's game in Ottawa.</p>

        <p>While more than half the Rangers fanned out over the metropolitan area to visit primary schools yesterday, Valery Kamensky was at the doctor's office, where X-rays showed he has a bruised kidney.</p>
        <p>That diagnosis means Kamensky, who sustained the injury during the Rangers' 5-1 rout of the Boston Bruins on Sunday night, will probably miss tomorrow night's game against Tampa Bay and Thursday night's game in Ottawa.</p>
        <p>Kamensky, who on Sunday became the first Ranger this season to score in the first period at home, is also highly questionable for Saturday night's game in Montreal.</p>
        <p>His absence could mean that John MacLean, who was scratched in 8 of the Rangers' first 10 games, could be back in the lineup this week. But Coach Ron Low did not sound so sure.</p>
        <p>''Based on the things that have been said, I'm not sure if that's what I want to do,'' Low said. He was referring to statements made by Glen Sather in The Edmonton Sun over the weekend, in which the Rangers' team president and general manager held up MacLean as something of a scapegoat for the team's early season struggles.</p>
        <p>Or the Rangers could call someone up from Hartford of the American Hockey League, most likely Johan Witehall, Low said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''We want to replace Val with somebody who can score,'' Low said, when asked why the Rangers would choose Witehall.</p>
        <p>And how about Manny Malhotra?</p>
        <p>''He's not the guy that has played the best down there,'' Low said. ''Witehall is playing a lot better. And Witehall has been ultra-physical, as well, which Manny has also been.''</p>
        <p>Kamensky's injury came at a bad time for Low, who was pleased with all of his forward lines for the first time this season coming out of Sunday night's game.</p>
        <p>''Last night was a great mix,'' Low said. He praised his reconstituted fourth line, which had Theo Fleury shifting from right wing to left wing alongside Tim Taylor and Sandy McCarthy. Low also praised the play of Adam Graves alongside Mark Messier and Kamensky.</p>
        <p>''And we had a physical component on each line other than the Czech line,'' Low said.</p>
        <p>Low, Sather, two other coaches and 12 players visited schools as part of Madison Square Garden's Cheering for Children program, the brainchild of Dave Checketts, Garden president. Sather, Messier and Brian Leetch went to P. S. 89 in Elmhurst, Queens, where they were treated to skits from the school's after-school program before answering questions from the children.</p>
        <p>Sather was also told that for 43 percent of the children present yesterday, English was not their first language.</p>
        <p>''You really don't understand the diversity in the United States until you go to the schools,'' said Sather, who spent his last 24 years running the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
        <p>More than 500 Garden employees visited schools yesterday. Before they did, they met for a rally inside the Garden's theater, where Bill Cosby was a surprise guest speaker. He stole the show with a monologue about how the Garden employees should not fear their school visits.  And Checketts spoke glowingly of the 122 sites -- and 25,000 children -- the organization visited in the last year.</p>
        <p>At the theater podium, Teresa Weatherspoon spoke on behalf of the Liberty, and Walt Frazier represented the Knicks.</p>
        <p>For the Rangers, Messier spoke of how his father inspired him to visit schools, as did the movie ''To Sir, With Love.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Before VALERY KAMENSKY's injury, it looked as though JOHN MacLEAN would soon be gone. The Rangers have given his agent permission to work out a deal with another team. GLEN SATHER, the team president and general manager, said that the Rangers would pick up some of the remaining money on MacLean's contract if another team signed him. ''Or he's going to play at Hartford,'' Sather said.</p>
