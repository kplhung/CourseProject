        <p>HERZECA-Lincoln J, Sr., ''Link'', passed away peacefully in the early morning of October 28, 2000 at the age of 85. Link, a professional engineer, was a proud graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and served during World War II as a Captain in the Army Corps of Engineers in Alaska and the European theater. Link's motto, ''if you are going to do something, do it right'', was pursued avidly whether in the design and construction of various types of aircraft and buildings, sailboat racing or vegetable gardening. Link will be lovingly remembered by Josette, his wife of 54 years, sons Lincoln Jr. and Christian &amp; their wives, Luz Angela and Lois, his two grandchildren, Jane and Nicholas, and additional family and friends.</p>
