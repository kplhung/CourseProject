        <p>Like it or hate it, it is impossible not to marvel, at least for a moment, at the obsessive detail of the production of ''La Boheme'' that Franco Zeffirelli mounted at the Metropolitan Opera in 1981, and which returned for the first showing of the season on Saturday evening. The very first stage picture makes Mr. Zeffirelli's aims clear enough: the bohemians' cluttered garret sits on a line of weathered Parisian rooftops, many of them with bent chimneys pouring smoke into a slate sky.</p>
        <p>It shows, as do Mr. Zeffirelli's other Met stagings, that with a big enough budget, theatrical production can become cinematography. Perhaps the best way to regard these stagings is not as opera productions in the most modern sense -- that is, productions in which a director seeks fresh insights within works that have become blunted by constant repetition -- but as 3-D movies. Better still, think of them as 3-D movie sets with static scripts and regularly rotating casts. You can sit back and let Puccini's opera roll over you as if it were a videocassette of ''Casablanca'' in which some nights Rick is played by, say, Hugh Grant rather than Humphrey Bogart.</p>

        <p>For its current cast, the Met has assembled a cast of young singers who are at ease in their roles and have both attractive voices and the power to project into the house. Marcello Giordani, a tenor from Sicily who has been heard a good deal at the Met in recent seasons, and Cristina Gallardo-Domas, a soprano from Chile, are virtually everything one wants in Rodolfo and Mimi. They are trim and youthful, they move well onstage, and they have both the timbre and the power to project their characterizations.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Giordani sings at full volume, one hears an echo of Placido Domingo's timbre and style; but when he takes down the volume, he produces a drier, more soft-edged sound that he used to fine effect in, for example, the final phrases of ''Che gelida manina.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gallardo-Domas was an equally effective and affecting, if also slightly exotic, Mimi. Her sound is focused and light, but fully supported. Perhaps the most salient feature of her work on Saturday was the degree to which she used nicely controlled, expressive dynamics to convey a sense of Mimi's simplicity and warmth. Sondra Radvanovsky put her brighter timbre and high energy to good use as Musetta.</p>
        <p>Jean-Luc Chaignaud made his house debut as a sympathetic Marcello, and the other bohemians -- Richard Bernstein as Colline and Mark Oswald as Schaunard -- as well as Thomas Hammons as Benoit and Alcindoro, all contributed solidly. Sharon Thomas, who has taken over the stage direction, moves the action along efficiently, and Marco Armiliato drew an appealingly robust sound from the orchestra.</p>
