        <p>Ancient Morsels</p>
        <p>Researchers digging in the remains of an ancient settlement in Panama have uncovered microscopic buried treasure: tiny grains of starch that they say are the earliest direct evidence of the cultivation of root crops in the Americas.</p>
        <p>The researchers, from Temple University and the Smithsonian Institution, found the starch grains, which are generally less than 30 microns long -- less than half the width of a human hair -- at an archaeological site near the Pacific coast of Panama. The grains were identified as coming from manioc, yams and arrowroot and were found on milling stones in sediments that date from 5,000 to 7,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>By comparing the size and other characteristics of the grains to those from modern domesticated and wild versions of the same root plants, the researchers were able to determine that the ancient grains came from domesticated plants. The researchers, who described their work in the journal Nature, also found maize starch at the archaeological site, meaning that these ancient peoples were cultivating seed plants along with root plants.</p>
        <p>Whether tropical forest areas like this site were early centers for domestication and cultivation has been a subject of debate. Given that forests are home to wild versions of these plants, it would seem to make sense that domestication began in or near forests. But evidence has been hard to come by, because remains of roots and tubers easily decompose in the humid tropical environment. The relatively few grains obtained by the researchers in Panama were found by scraping them from nooks and crannies on the stones, where they had been able to beat the heat and humidity.</p>
        <p>Flying Robot, Part II</p>
        <p>The team of engineers responsible for the first trans-Atlantic flight by a robotic aircraft plans to try a similar trip across the Pacific.</p>
        <p>The engineers, at the University of Washington and a private company, the Insitu Group, are developing a new aircraft for the flight, planned for next summer or fall. The 5,000-mile journey, from west to east to take advantage of prevailing winds, should take about two days.</p>
        <p>In 1998, a small pilotless aircraft developed by the researchers flew 2,000 miles from Newfoundland to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland in a little under 27 hours, using a gallon and a half of fuel. The plane took off from a special cradle attached to the roof of a speeding car.</p>
        <p>The new plane can take off from a car or be launched using a small pneumatic catapult. The plane is about the same size and weight as the model that flew the Atlantic, with a fuselage that is about 4.5 feet long, a 10-foot wingspan and a weight of about 30 pounds. Both models use rear propellers, but the new one lacks the old one's tail, which was shaped like an inverted V. Like the old model, the new one will navigate autonomously, using an onboard Global Positioning System unit.</p>
        <p>The Pacific flight is intended to demonstrate the plane's potential for use in remote weather observation or reconnaissance.</p>
        <p>Saturn Recaptures a Lead</p>
        <p>There's a new kind of space race going on, and it doesn't involve the United States and Russia. Rather, it's a struggle between two solar system superpowers, Saturn and Uranus, for the title of Most Moons.</p>
        <p>Saturn had led for a long time, with 18 to Uranus' 17, but 1999 was not a very good year for the ringed planet. That year, astronomers discovered first one new moon around Uranus and then three more, giving it a 21 to 18 lead.</p>
        <p>Now, however, the same team that discovered all those Uranian moons has discovered four more around Saturn, nudging it back into the top spot.</p>
        <p>Like most other moons discovered in recent years, these newfound objects are very small,  about 6 to 30 miles in diameter, and in irregular orbits millions of miles from Saturn.</p>
