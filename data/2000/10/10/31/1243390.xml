        <p>For chess enthusiasts the match being played in London between Garry Kasparov, the world's top-ranked player, and Vladimir Kramnik, the No. 2 player, is the most significant since Mr. Kasparov last put his world championship title on the line, in 1995.</p>
        <p>Whoever wins -- and Mr. Kramnik, who leads the match 7 1/2-5 1/2 and could win it today -- will receive $1.33 million and be world champion.</p>
        <p>Or will he?</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasparov, 37, who won the world title in 1985 and has not lost a match since, is widely considered one of the greatest champions in history. But he is not universally recognized as world champion.</p>
        <p>A long-running feud between Mr. Kasparov and the game's governing body and a lawsuit filed by Anatoly Karpov, Mr. Kasparov's predecessor, against the same organization have left at least three players with claims on the title.</p>
        <p>To some the situation resembles the dysfunctional state of another sport with multiple champions. ''It's become more like boxing,'' said Viswanathan Anand of India, who is the world's third-ranked player.</p>
        <p>Others say the competing claims have created more than mere confusion. Yasser Seirawan, a three-time United States champion, said, ''The world championship title has been cheapened.''</p>
        <p>In the insular world of chess, intrigue and infighting are constant. But for more than 100 years there was only one acknowledged world champion, a distinction a player earned by beating the previous world champion or by demonstrating clear superiority over his peers in a grueling series of matches.</p>
        <p>That changed in 1993, when Mr. Kasparov broke from the International Chess Federation, known by the acronym FIDE (pronounced FEE-day), for its name in French, Federation Internationale des Echecs.</p>
        <p>The cause of the break was the federation's handling of his title match with Nigel Short of Britain. After Mr. Kasparov and Mr. Short started their own organization, the Professional Chess Association, and set up their own match, FIDE, which had run the championship matches since 1948, declared that Mr. Kasparov was no longer champion.</p>
        <p>To fill its vacant title, FIDE organized a match between Mr. Karpov and Jan Timman, a Dutch player. But the federation found it difficult to raise prize money for an event that did not include Mr. Kasparov.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karpov won the match and was proclaimed world champion by the federation, but most players still accepted Mr. Kasparov as champion after he beat Mr. Short. The Intel Corporation agreed to sponsor his new organization and underwrote qualifying events to select a new challenger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anand emerged as that challenger, and Mr. Kasparov beat him in a match atop the World Trade Center in 1995. But since then, Mr. Kasparov's position has been shaken, creating openings for his rivals.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the Anand match, Intel decided not to renew its sponsorship of the Professional Chess Association, and Mr. Kasparov was unable to find another sponsor. Short of money, the association collapsed.</p>
        <p>Two years later, Mr. Kasparov played and lost a six-game exhibition match against Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer developed by I.B.M. Grandmasters saw the match as a mere exhibition, but some acknowledged that the public might have thought that Mr. Kasparov had lost the world title.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seirawan, publisher of Inside Chess, said: ''Even my mother asked, 'Isn't the computer world champion?' The perception is terrible, but it is typical of the average lay person.''</p>
        <p>In 1998 Mr. Kasparov tried to find a challenger by organizing a match between Mr. Kramnik and Alexei Shirov, a Latvian living in Spain, with the winner to face Mr. Kasparov.</p>
        <p>Most observers have long thought of Mr. Kramnik, 25, as the biggest threat to Mr. Kasparov's supremacy. After Mr. Shirov unexpectedly won, no sponsor for a match with Mr. Kasparov could be found.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seirawan speculated that sponsors were wary of financing the match without an established organization behind it, despite Mr. Kasparov's prestige.</p>
        <p>''You have to put yourself in the position of the person writing and signing the check,'' he said. ''Who is the money payable to? To Garry Kasparov? To the Garry Kasparov association? It makes the simplest thing become very difficult. In the past, FIDE solved this problem, rightly or wrongly.''</p>
        <p>This year Mr. Kasparov got a sponsor, the Brain Games Network, and eventually approached Mr. Kramnik, who agreed to a match.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Kasparov searched for an opponent, FIDE struggled. Its longtime president, Florencio Campomanes, resigned in 1995. He was replaced by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a wealthy businessman who is the president of Kalmykia, a region in southern Russia.</p>
        <p>A year later, Mr. Karpov successfully defended his title against Gata Kamsky, a Russian-born American.</p>
        <p>In 1998 the federation changed the way it selects its champion. It created an every-other-year elimination tournament based on seedings, like the system used in tennis tournaments.</p>
        <p>For the first championship tournament, Mr. Karpov was seeded into the final, in which he beat Mr. Anand. But then, rather than wait until this year, the federation held its second championship tournament last year in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Angry about having to defend his title sooner than he had anticipated and about not being seeded into the final, Mr. Karpov boycotted the event and sued FIDE for breach of contract. The lawsuit is now before the Court of Arbitration of Sports in Lausanne, Switzerland. Mr. Karpov, who says he is the rightful world champion, could not be reached for comment, and the federation declined to comment on the suit.</p>
        <p>Aleksandr Khalifman, a Russian then ranked No. 31 in the world, won the second tournament and was proclaimed world champion by FIDE.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasparov has derided the federation's new system. In a letter in 1998 to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, who urged Mr. Kasparov to take part in the tournament, Mr. Kasparov said, ''The format being suggested flies directly in the face of tradition and unfortunately trivializes the world title.''</p>
        <p>Others share Mr. Kasparov's opinion. Mr. Seirawan said: ''The format is not a contest that is appropriate to chess. It's more like March Madness, where a single game is determined by one shot.''</p>
        <p>Raymond Keene, an English grandmaster who is an organizer of the Kasparov-Kramnik match and an investor in Brain Games, said of FIDE's new system, ''It is a laughable cardboard imitation.''</p>
        <p>Some chess professionals have become disillusioned with the federation itself. Malcolm Pein, an international master who is the director of the Kasparov-Kramnik match as well the London Chess Center, said, ''It's a great idea to commercialize chess, but FIDE's ideas -- they've talked about putting all prize money in FIDE's coffers and copyrighting all games -- it's just one act of lunacy after another.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shirov, for his part, has attacked Mr. Kramnik's right to play for the title. ''Kramnik is not a legitimate challenger in any way,'' he said. ''He has not proved himself. Even if he wins he would not be world champion, because this is not a legitimate world title match. It is more like an exhibition.''</p>
        <p>In reply to written questions about the Kasparov-Kramnik match, Mr. Ilyumzhinov said of Mr. Kasparov: ''Has he played in the World Chess Championship since 1993? FIDE's answer is no.'' He added, ''We recognize Aleksandr Khalifman as the 14th world champion and as the reigning world champion.''</p>
        <p>Many of the world's top players hope that things can be resolved. Mr. Anand said: ''The chess world has to get together again. It cannot go on like this.''</p>
