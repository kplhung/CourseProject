        <p>The freshman Omar Cook, who is expected to make plenty of headlines this season for St. John's, began making them yesterday.</p>
        <p>Asked how far this season's team could go, the point guard boldly declared, ''National championship, no less.'' Cook added that he would be very disappointed if St. John's did not make the Final Four.</p>
        <p>The Red Storm's Media Day is one of the few occasions when players in their first semester are permitted to talk to reporters. And thoughts of grandeur are not uncommon for young athletes who have yet to play a college game.</p>
        <p>St. John's, with nine new players, is full of such youthful enthusiasm. From Cook, the high school all-American guard being asked to replace Erick Barkley, to Jack Wolfinger, the 6-foot-11-inch swingman, the Red Storm will be one of the youngest teams in one of the youngest conferences.</p>
        <p>The Big East coaches picked St. John's second behind Connecticut in the new East Division. The Red Storm won the conference tournament last March.</p>
        <p>''It's very different,'' Coach Mike Jarvis said. ''Basically, a kid knows that if he produces in practice, he's going to get a chance to play, even if he is a freshman.''</p>
        <p>Forwards Anthony Glover and Reggie Jessie are the only returning starters. The new faces give St. John's a much-needed infusion of size, with four new players 6-8 or taller.</p>
        <p>Point guard remains St. John's and the Big East's glamour position. Cook joins Seton Hall's Andre Barrett and Connecticut's Taliek Brown to form the conference's most heralded point guard class. At St. John's, some players have described Cook and Barkley as being nearly identical, with Cook perhaps more of a passer than a scorer.</p>
        <p>Cook has been following Barkley since they were growing up in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. When Barkley was a senior at Christ the King High School in Queens, Cook was a freshman and relegated to the junior varsity. Cook had committed to attend St. John's when Barkley entered the National Basketball Association draft last spring. They last spoke in August, before Cook began classes and Barkley left for practice with the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
        <p>''He just said the game is the same, the same people you grew up playing against,'' said Cook, 18. ''No different.''</p>
        <p>But if Barkley became weary from the National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation that resulted in two suspensions last season, Cook has none of his predecessor's caution. He enjoys talking to reporters and speaks his mind.</p>
        <p>If Cook is simply replacing Barkley, the sophomore Alpha Bangura may have an even tougher assignment. Bangura, a transfer from Monmouth who sat out last season, will probably start at shooting guard. He would replace Lavor Postell, the Knicks' second-round draft pick, who was the Red Storm's leading rebounder last season.</p>
        <p>The freshman Willie Shaw, out of Kennedy High School in the Bronx, will share time at off-guard. He is more of a pure shooter and said coaches have given him the green light to shoot the ball.</p>
        <p>One sizable difference will be up front, where St. John's will finally have a true frontcourt. After playing out of position at center last season, 6-6 Anthony Glover should move back to power forward this season, allowing him to take on more of a scoring role. The center will be a freshman, Abe Keita or Mohammed Diakite. Keita, a 6-9 force from Tolland, Conn., sat out last season for academic reasons.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking, 'Gee, I could've helped,' '' Keita said.</p>
        <p>Diakite's status is still in doubt. The 6-10 center from Mali by way of Rockville, Md., last took the College Board exams on Oct. 21. Jarvis hopes Diakite receives those scores before St. John's opens its season Nov. 9 against Kentucky at Madison Square Garden in the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic.</p>
        <p>Kyle Cuffe, a 6-8 freshman from Rice High School in Manhattan, is learning to play forward.</p>
        <p>Jarvis has scrapped plans to redshirt Curtis Johnson, a 7-3 freshman from Norfolk, Va., who will be the tallest player in the conference this season.</p>
        <p>Jarvis was careful not to guarantee that St. John's new size would completely transform the team. He still intends to run the floor and get scoring from nearly everyone on the court.</p>
