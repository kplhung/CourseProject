        <p>The Nissan Motor Company reported a solid half-year profit today, the first evidence of a turnaround in the carmaker's fortunes since Renault of France rescued it from insolvency last year.</p>
        <p>The company also more than quadrupled its projections for profits this year, sending a signal that it thinks recovery is just beginning.</p>
        <p>''The revival plan is going further, moving faster and reaching deeper than we previously forecast,'' said Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's president and the architect of a sweeping overhaul aimed at reducing Nissan's bloated cost structure, paring its mountain of debts and improving its competitiveness.</p>
        <p>Consolidated net profit for the six-month period that ended on Sept. 30 was 170.2 billion yen, or $1.56 billion at current exchange rates, compared with a loss of 323.5 billion yen, or $2.97 billion, in the comparable period last year. ''That's the best in a decade,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''But you've only seen the beginning.''</p>
        <p>He called record sales in the United States, where Nissan sold 9.2 million vehicles, ''the largest good surprise,'' but the company's efforts at cost-cutting also made those sales more meaningful. Mr. Ghosn, whose nickname at Renault was ''le cost killer,'' has reduced purchasing costs by 10 percent, refinanced some of the company's debt and cut about 5 percent of its work force.</p>
        <p>Most big Japanese companies are working hard to cut their costs, but analysts and investors are pushing them to improve productivity also because expenses can only be cut so far. 'It's like a wet towel,'' said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''The first squeeze produces a lot of water, but subsequent squeezes are less productive.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Endo said that he and many other analysts had underestimated how fast Mr. Ghosn and Renault would have an effect on Nissan. ''Frankly, the numbers today are really impressive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But skepticism about Nissan's ability to thrive and grow once it fixes the nuts-and-bolts of its business still exists. Mr. Ghosn acknowledged as much and said it was perhaps his biggest frustration.</p>
        <p>The company, which once gave the Toyota Motor Corporation, Japan's largest automaker, a run for its money, is now the third-largest Japanese car company, and it continues to lose market share at home. In the first six months of the fiscal year, Nissan sold 335,000 cars, a decline of 9.4 percent, and Mr. Ghosn would say only that the company's business in Japan had stabilized.</p>
        <p>Nissan has introduced two new models here this year, while Toyota has introduced 12, and without new models, the company will have trouble generating consumer interest, analysts said. By the end of 2002, Nissan will have 15 new products in the market.</p>
        <p>''Until we have established Nissan in its home market,'' Mr. Ghosn said, ''there will always be some doubts about the success of the revival plan.''</p>
        <p>The results underlined the company's increasing reliance on the United States, where, according to rumor, it is considering building a new plant in Mississippi. In the period, the weak euro cost the company 90 billion yen, or $826 million, and sales in Europe also fell. Mr. Ghosn said he thought the biggest potential risks to Nissan are softness in the United States market, rising prices for oil and metals, and the threat of higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>Offsetting those risks are the company's alliance with Renault, which is expected to improve productivity of existing manufacturing plants as Renault cars begin to roll off Nissan assembly lines, as well as the stronger dollar.</p>
        <p>''I believe we are at the point where we have as many opportunities as we have risks,'' Mr. Ghosn said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 2, 2000, Thursday  An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the Nissan Motor Company's results for the six months ended Sept. 30 misstated the number of cars it sold in the United States. The number was 406,000; 9.2 million was the total in the United States for all automakers.</p>
