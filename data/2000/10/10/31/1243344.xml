        <p>Cable and Wireless P.L.C. outlined its plans today to build a nationwide fiber optic network in Japan and roll out high-speed Internet and data services to corporate clients.</p>
        <p>Cable and Wireless, which is based in Britain, said it would spend $1.4 billion over a five-year period to connect 80 cities in all 47 prefectures in Japan. The company will add 1,000 employees to its current work force of 800 at its Japanese unit, which is called Cable and Wireless I.D.C.</p>
        <p>''Today's announcement reinforces the importance of Japan as one of the three key markets'' for Cable and Wireless's strategy, along with the United States and Europe, the chief executive, Graham Wallace, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>In recent years, foreign service providers have become more interested in Japan, the second-largest market for telecommunication services.</p>
        <p>Last October, MCI WorldCom announced that it had agreed with the Mori Building Company to build an advanced fiber optic network in central Tokyo and in June 1999, Cable and Wireless took control of International Digital Communications Inc., a Japanese overseas telephone carrier in which Cable and Wireless was a founding shareholder.</p>
        <p>Cable and Wireless said today that it would build metropolitan networks in Tokyo and Osaka using a mixture of fiber, D.S.L. and local multipoint distribution service technologies.</p>
        <p>Cable and Wireless said that Japan's market for business Internet Protocol and data services was forecast to grow by at least 20 percent annually to $28 billion dollars in five years.</p>
