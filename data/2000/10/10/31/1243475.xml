        <p>American Ballet Theater  City Center</p>
        <p>Legend has it that Antony Tudor surreptitiously sprayed the set of his ''Jardin aux Lilas'' with lilac scent just before the first American performance of the ballet in 1940. It is hard to imagine dancers needing that touch of danse verite to lose themselves in the fragrant romantic mazes of this nighttime garden party where two pairs of lovers secretly say goodbye before a marriage of convenience.</p>
        <p>There is atmosphere to spare in the dancers' posture and odd expressive gestures, as well as the fevered Chausson score. And when the ballet is danced as it was by American Ballet Theater on Saturday afternoon, Tudor's intricate liaisons are intensely affecting.</p>
        <p>Julie Kent made Caroline, the bride-to-be, a creature of steely delicacy with a sadly readable future as a decorative, obedient wife. A quietly ardent Maxim Belotserkovsky made it clear why Caroline had fallen in love with him. And Robert Hill's ramrod-straight Man She Must Marry communicated chill, unfeeling power. The revelation of the cast was Erica Fischbach as An Episode in His Past. In an unusually three-dimensional portrayal, Ms. Fischbach made the character, who must give up the man Caroline is marrying, a creature of great pride and hidden passion.</p>
        <p>Tom Lingwood's dark and dense garden was substituted for the usual set by Zack Brown, which a company spokeswoman said did not fit on the City Center stage. The staging was by Sallie Wilson. Ronald Oakland was the violin soloist. Ormsby Wilkins conducted.</p>
        <p>An eager, gifted young cast of lead dancers (Gillian Murphy, Marcelo Gomes and Carlos Molina) made something a great deal more exciting of Harald Lander's ''Etudes'' than the museum piece it sometimes resembles.</p>
        <p>The program opened with George Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations.'' Paloma Herrera and Jose Manuel Carreno, the leads, are a handsome physical match but neither looked entirely comfortable, particularly in the partnering.</p>
