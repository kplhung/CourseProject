      <block class="full_text">
        <p>DON'T think of Douglas H. Lasdon, please, as a do-gooder lawyer.</p>
        <p>Think of him as Doug Lasdon, Do-Gooder P.I.</p>
        <p>He does put in a lot of hours in his office as executive director of the Urban Justice Center; his was one of the groups that waged a successful legal battle against the Grand Central Partnership and the 34th Street Partnership for employing homeless workers at $1 an hour.</p>
        <p>But what Mr. Lasdon, 45, a tall guy with a ponytail, most enjoys is the detective work. Going out to the soup kitchens, which he does weekly, though he has a staff of 40, to find out what's on the mind of ''the clientele.''</p>
        <p>''We go to soup kitchens because there are people who don't know they have rights,'' Mr. Lasdon says, in his office in Lower Manhattan, excited, talking with his hands. ''You wouldn't believe the injustice suffered by my clients.''</p>
        <p>Let's cut to his contributions. Do not be modest, Mr. Lasdon.</p>
        <p>''I have a long history of changing the law and changing the system,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Grinning, for while he wears the uniform of worn jeans and tattered sweater, he is actually an unusually cheerful do-gooder. ''Well, you said not to be modest.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult, looking at the struggles of the poor people of New York in the last 15 years, to go for any time without seeing the name of Douglas Lasdon or the Urban Justice Center, which he founded. Their legal fights have included Doe v. City of New York, which established the right for homeless married couples to remain together in city shelters, and Tolle v. Dinkins, which required the city and state to reduce population limits in two overcrowded armory shelters.</p>
        <p>Susan Butler Plum, director of the  Skadden Fellowship Foundation, which gives grants to young lawyers to provide services to the poor, says Mr. Lasdon turned the Urban Justice Center into ''an incubator for progressive ideas and projects.''</p>
        <p>''We made a grant several years ago to provide legal services to homeless and runaway gay youth who were essentially living on the street,'' she said. ''Nobody else would have touched that. Doug just kept at the idea and knew kids were everywhere because most of them had been thrown out of their homes because of their orientation.''</p>
        <p>You know how people hang, on their office walls, a picture of a place they love?</p>
        <p>What Mr. Lasdon has on his wall is a photo of an abandoned building in Harlem, and he talks about that building the way other people talk about Paris.</p>
        <p>''That's where it started, in a burned-out building. I was by myself. In the winter we would put boards over the window. We strung electrical cords to the building next door to bring in heat.''</p>
        <p>HE is talking about the beginning of the Urban Justice Center. He can talk about that work for hours.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Lasdon cannot explain is why he, a private school kid from Scarsdale whose father was a businessman, came to be so concerned about the poor.</p>
        <p>Nor does he think the reason is important. Better to know what you want to do with your life, he says. Mr. Lasdon, who graduated from the Wharton School and Cornell Law School, and who briefly studied Buddhist philosophy, says he knew from the time he was in college that he had ''to work against injustice for poor people.''</p>
        <p>His first legal job was at Covenant House, a Manhattan shelter for homeless teenagers. Talking with them, he learned that at 18 they had to leave foster care and fend for themselves. For many, this meant being sent to adult homeless shelters. Mr. Lasdon was convinced he had a case. Unable to pursue the case at Covenant House, he resigned, then joined forces with a Catholic priest, the Rev. David Kirk, who ran Emmaus House, a shelter in Harlem. Out of that was born the Legal Action Center and Mr. Lasdon's first legal victory.</p>
        <p>''I found one sentence that became my modus operandi,'' Mr. Lasdon says. ''It said the state and the city must supervise kids in foster care who have been discharged to independent living until age 21. That doesn't mean a token and directions to a men's shelter.''</p>
        <p>Another example of legal detective work?</p>
        <p>''I remember one of my professors saying the skill is to look at a mass of facts and see the lawsuit; the lawsuit that will have the big impact that you can win. If it offends your sense of justice, there's a lawsuit. That's my saying.''</p>
        <p>A less-successful fight has been to establish public toilets in New York. The Urban Justice Center filed a lawsuit against the city 10 years ago, arguing that the city's failure to provide public toilets was a violation of the public service law. The lawsuit was dismissed. An Urban Justice Center report on public toilets, however, which cites the self-cleaning unit in France, is credited with bringing attention to the subject.</p>
        <p>''That was my doing,'' Mr. Lasdon says of the report. ''I researched it when I was in France. I was on vacation. Then I took 20 law students and we did a study of the toilets in New York, or lack of.''</p>
        <p>This is what he does on vacation, research?</p>
        <p>''I knew it was a problem,'' Mr. Lasdon says. ''The reality is a lot of people don't have bathrooms to use. Their stories would break your heart.''</p>
