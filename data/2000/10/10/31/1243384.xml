        <p>After losing two to three weeks of training time because of an illness, Joseph Chebet of Kenya will not defend his title in this year's New York City Marathon, withdrawing yesterday from Sunday's race.</p>
        <p>''He became ill while in Kenya,'' said Anne Roberts, the elite athlete coordinator for the marathon. ''Whether it was malaria or not, I'm not sure.</p>
        <p>''We're disappointed not to have the defending champion, but we completely understand the situation. It hurts him, as well. He wasn't picked for the Olympics, so all of his focus went into this event. It's very upsetting to him.''</p>
        <p>John Kagwe of Kenya and German Silva of Mexico, both two-time champions, have become the favorites. Although Chebet has been feeling much better in recent days and may appear at prerace events this week, he was not fit to run competitively for 26.2 miles through the five boroughs. Chebet's agent, Gabriele Rosa, told marathon officials of the situation over the weekend. Rosa was in Italy yesterday and was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>''I think he felt it was not fair to anyone to run when he wasn't at his best,'' Roberts said. ''We certainly don't want him to do anything that might endanger his health.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the wispy Chebet shook off two years of heartbreak in New York when he pulled away from Domingos Castro to win the marathon in 2 hours  9 minutes 14 seconds. On the heels of his 1999 Boston Marathon victory, he had finally rid himself of a career filled with second-place finishes. With such breakout efforts, Chebet, who finished second in New York in 1997 and 1998, became the first man since Alberto Salazar in 1982 to win in Boston and in New York during the same year.</p>
