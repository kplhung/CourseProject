        <p>THE THIRD PARTIES</p>
        <p>RUNOFF SYSTEM SUGGESTED -- John B. Anderson, who won 6.6 percent of the vote as an independent presidential candidate in 1980, says some of the hand-wringing among left-leaning voters would be unnecessary if the nation adopted an ''instant runoff'' system of voting. In the system, used in some European countries, voters rank candidates in order of preference; if no candidate receives 50 percent of the vote, the second choices of voters whose first choices were eliminated are counted. ''If you had that system, Nader would zoom in the polls,'' Mr. Anderson said. But, he said, Ralph Nader's supporters would have a say in the second round between major-party candidates. Mr. Anderson, who is supporting Mr. Nader, the Green Party nominee, is president of the Center for Voting and Democracy, a nonpartisan group that studies electoral systems.</p>

        <p>BEHIND SCHEDULE -- Patrick J. Buchanan, who is using $12.6 million in federal money for his campaign, has not disclosed his most recent spending. Mr. Buchanan, the Reform Party nominee, missed the Federal Election Commission's deadline last Thursday for reporting fund-raising and spending during the first 18 days of October. It is the last report before the election, and all presidential and Congressional candidates who have raised or spent at least $5,000 were required to file. The Buchanan campaign, which could be fined for not filing on time, says it is working on the report.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>INVOKING A SAINT -- The man for all seasons found his name being invoked this election season as Dick Cheney noted yesterday that Pope John Paul II was about to proclaim St. Thomas More the patron saint of statesmen and politicians. And, the way Mr. Cheney told it at a Catholic high school in Rochester, Minn., the churchman who stood up to Henry VIII sounded just a little bit like Gov. George W. Bush. ''When the announcement was made at the Vatican last week, one politician present praised More as a figure who unites rather than divides, a man with great universal appeal,'' said Mr. Cheney, whose running mate likes to say that he is a uniter, not a divider. ''Today our world needs more Thomas Mores. Governor Bush and I can never live up to his standards, but we can try, and that is what we will do if we are elected next Tuesday.''</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>THE NUMBERS -- Vice President Al Gore wrapped up a two-day swing through Michigan and Wisconsin, while Gov. George W. Bush headed west, for states like California that traditionally vote Democratic. Here are the stats:</p>
        <p>Length of official day: Gore, 14 1/2 hours; Bush, 15 hours</p>
        <p>States visited: Gore, 2; Bush, 2</p>
        <p>Cities/towns visited: Gore, 5 (Muskegon and Green Bay, Mich.; Fond Du Lac, Waukesha and Milwaukee, Wis.) Bush, 5 (Austin, Tex.; Albuquerque and Bosque Farms, N.M.; Burbank and Fresno, Calif.)</p>
        <p>Miles traveled: Gore, 248; Bush, 1499</p>
        <p>Official events: Gore, 4; Bush, 4</p>
        <p>Main message: Gore, prosperity is on the ballot; Bush, ''bringing America together,'' school reform.</p>
