        <p>A busy week for the Women's United Soccer Association began yesterday when the league, which is scheduled to begin play in April, doled out 16 international players to its eight charter franchises.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the league plans to unveil team nicknames, logos and stadiums at a news conference in midtown Manhattan. The New York franchise is expected to announce that it will play its home games at the Mitchel Athletic Complex in Uniondale on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the New York team landed two Norwegian players, Ann Kristin Aarones and Gro Espeseth, who were part of the team that beat the United States in the semifinals of the 1995 Women's World Cup and went on to win the title.</p>
        <p>With the first selections in the allocation draft, Orlando grabbed Norway's top goalkeeper, Bente Nordby, and her countrywoman Hege Riise, a central midfielder.</p>
        <p>Picking second, Philadelphia took Doris Fitschen of Germany and Kelly Smith of England. Smith, the women's assistant coach at Seton Hall, finished her collegiate career at Seton Hall with 76 goals and 174 points, and was a three-time all-American. Smith was with the English national team yesterday in Ukraine playing in a playoff qualifier for the European women's championship.</p>
        <p>The Bay Area franchise then selected two Brazilian stars, Katia and Sissi. Washington, picking seventh, also took two Brazilians, Pretinha and Roseli. The Canadian international Charmaine Hooper went to Atlanta along with Homare Sawa of Japan.</p>
        <p>AMERICANS ABROAD</p>
        <p>During the past several weeks, Americans in top leagues overseas have seen more of the bench and reserve-team games than they would like.</p>
        <p>In England, Joe-Max Moore, a goal-scoring sensation when he joined Everton of the Premier League last season, came off the bench in the 66th minute on Saturday against crosstown rival Liverpool. Moore did, however, play all 90 minutes in a reserve match last week and was joined on the field by his national team teammate Gregg Berhalter. Berhalter, who played previously in the Netherlands but is now available on a free transfer, is playing with Everton on a trial basis.</p>
        <p>Also in England, midfielder Eddie Lewis has seen his playing time evaporate at the First Division club Fulham, which is battling for promotion and is now coached by the former French international Jean Tigana. Ben Olsen, a recent addition at Nottingham Forest, played in his third straight game as Forest dumped Stockport County in a First Division match.</p>
        <p>Tony Sanneh, a defender, played the entire 90 minutes in his second straight start in the Bundesliga as Hertha Berlin took over first place from Bayern Munich this past weekend. Landon Donovan, who starred in last week's United States victory over Mexico in Los Angeles, is back with the Bayern Leverkusen reserve team and scored two goals against S.V. Straelen. Also in Germany, Grover Gibson had a goal in Elversberg's 3-1 victory over Offenbach in a Regionalliga Sud match.</p>
        <p>The national team goalkeeper Kasey Keller played in his third straight UEFA Cup match for Rayo Vallecano of Spain, but he has been on the bench for Rayo in recent Spanish League matches.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>England and Italy were buzzing yesterday over reports that the Swedish coach of Lazio, Sven-Goran Eriksson, was close to signing a contract to become the first foreign coach of the English national team. ANSA, the Italian news agency, reported that Eriksson had signed a deal to take over on July 1, 2001, when his contract with Lazio is to expire. Later, the executive director of the English Football Association, David Davies, would confirm only that discussions had taken place.</p>
        <p>''Meetings have taken place over the past 24 hours with Sven-Goran Eriksson and representatives of his club, Lazio,'' Davies said. ''The F.A. have discussed the possibility of him taking charge of the England team both for key games in the short term, and in a full-time capacity in the long term. Those talks will resume in the near future.''</p>
        <p>England has been without a full-time coach since Kevin Keegan resigned after a 1-0 defeat by Germany on Oct. 7. Other possible candidates include the French coach of Arsenal, Arsene Wenger, and Johan Cruyff, a former star of the Dutch national team.</p>
        <p>The Argentine club Velez Sarsfield, which is deep in debt, sold goalkeeper JosE Luis Chilavert to Strasbourg of France yesterday. Chilavert said he was owed more than $2 million in salary, a sum that Starsbourg paid Velez Sarsfield to land the colorful star of Paraguay's national team. . . . Borussia Dortmund of the Bundesliga will soon become the first German club to go public. Dortmund would join other European powers (Manchester United of England, Lazio of Rome and Ajax of Amsterdam) selling team shares to the public. Dortmund expects to raise about $124.7 million in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.</p>
