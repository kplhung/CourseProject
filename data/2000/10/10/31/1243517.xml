        <p>Just steps away from a splashing creek, the compact hydropower plant in Stephen F. Formel's backyard was supposed to teach his six children to think creatively about energy. Instead, he said, it became a lesson in red tape.</p>
        <p>Mr. Formel must connect his hydropowered generator to the local utility, New York State Electric and Gas, to start the process of producing electricity for his farmhouse and a 1763 sawmill that is being restored. But a new state regulation requires him to buy $1 million of insurance coverage against damage or injury to the utility or its customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Formel, who lives in this rural town just south of Albany, says the insurance would cost him at least $10,000 a year, largely offsetting the $17,000 worth of electricity that he could produce to light and heat his home and run the sawmill once it was finished. He says he now pays about $4,200 a year for heat and electricity.</p>
        <p>''This is holding down the development of small hydropower,'' said Mr. Formel, 51, as he stared in frustration at the creek. ''I can produce enough power here to light six to eight homes. I can produce enough power to employ seven or eight men. I can make a living with this, but I can't now because of this regulation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Formel's troubles come at a time when there is concern nationwide that an increasing demand for electricity will soon outpace the supply. While federal and state officials have promoted the development of alternative energy sources, many smaller electricity producers in New York say they continue to face high start-up costs and other barriers in an industry dominated by huge commercial utilities.</p>
        <p>The Public Service Commission approved the new insurance regulation last December as part of a comprehensive package that was specifically intended to help electricity producers like Mr. Formel gain access to the power grid. For years before that, such producers had to negotiate for access with their local utilities, which often demanded even more expensive insurance policies as a way of discouraging competition, according to experts on the industry.</p>
        <p>David Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission, said it was now considering eliminating the regulation after receiving complaints from Mr. Formel and others that the insurance was expensive and difficult to obtain. ''This is obviously a concern,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although utilities have long required such insurance, many hydro plant operators and industry experts say there is little risk of damage. ''I'm not aware of a single instance where independent generation has caused damage or personal injury to third parties in the last 20 years,'' said Peter Chamberlain, an energy consultant for E Cubed in Manhattan. ''It's a risk that just hasn't materialized.''</p>
        <p>But Clayton Ellis, a spokesman for New York State Electric and Gas, said the insurance was necessary to protect the utility and its 825,000 customers. ''To say the insurance requirement should be dropped simply because it has seldom, if ever, come into play would be similar to rushing out to cancel one's automobile insurance because you've never had an accident,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis said his utility maintained agreements with 30 small electricity producers, including schools, hospitals and one homeowner. He would not comment specifically on Mr. Formel's case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Formel, a retired ship captain who serves on the local school board, says he spent $150,000 to piece together his hydro plant from concrete and salvaged steel parts over eight years. It took four years just to wangle a permit from state environmental officials for an 80-foot-long dam. Then he had to wait for a dry summer so that he could divert the water with sandbags and build the dam.</p>
        <p>He wanted the hydro plant to show his children that electricity does not just flow from a wall switch. (He raised chickens, too, to show them that eggs do not come from a carton.) But so much time has passed that two daughters and a son have left home for college without seeing electricity flow from water, either.</p>
        <p>In this quiet town of 6,400, few people have not heard about Mr. Formel's energy project. Friends and neighbors have stopped by to take a look, and even stayed for an impromptu demonstration of hydropower. With a flip of a metal switch, water rushes through a two-foot-wide pipe and down into an orange turbine. Just as quickly, the water flows out again without producing even a flicker of light, because the turbine is not connected to the generator sitting beside it.</p>
        <p>Those who know Mr. Formel say that he will figure out a way to operate the hydro plant. If the insurance regulation is not dropped, Mr. Formel concedes that he can always build a stand-alone system that does not need to be connected to the power grid, but he points out that that sort of system is more costly and less reliable.</p>
        <p>''He sets his mind to doing whatever he wants,'' Nathan Formel, 15, said about his father. ''He wanted chickens, so he's got chickens. He wanted to run a mill, and he does. He's been working his whole life.''</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Formel cannot yet produce electricity, he has taught his children something after all -- a lesson in not giving up.</p>
