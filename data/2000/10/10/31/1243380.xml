        <p>The canyons of finance were thronged with gloating Yankee fans. Their wretched confetti drifted through the air. Their hateful toilet paper was everywhere -- in the trees, on the asphalt, wrapped around their heads. It was their day, all day. Their beer cans were pressed to smug and smiling lips.</p>
        <p>For the Mets fans of New York, there was only one response to such an awful display: hiding their faces and hanging their heads. Ignoring the hoopla and going back to work.</p>
        <p>It was clearly not enough that Mets fans had to start the week under the dark cloud of yet another Yankee championship, this one at the expense of their team. They were also forced to endure the bone-crushing shame of a Yankee victory parade.</p>
        <p>While most of them acted as though lower Broadway had been hit with the bubonic plague yesterday, there were an unfortunate few who were forced to confront their worst nightmare and actually come within spitting distance of the Yankees and their parade.</p>
        <p>Danny Martin, a 32-year-old Mets fan, fixes elevators for a living and had to enter the maelstrom yesterday to get to a job. He tried crossing Broadway from west to east, but got nowhere fast -- and then it happened. Mr. Martin found himself trapped in a hollering swarm of Yankee fans.</p>
        <p>''I just kept whispering 'Ya gotta believe' under my breath,'' he recounted in the stunned tones of a man who has just survived a plane crash. ''Then I said a couple of Our Fathers just to make sure I made it through.''</p>
        <p>Jesse Nasrat, another Mets fan, operates a hot-dog cart just west of Broadway at the corner of Park Place. Mr. Nasrat is an intelligent man. He kept his Mets shirt out of sight beneath a dark blue turtleneck and a denim jacket he buttoned to the throat.</p>
        <p>''It would kill business if I was known as a Mets fan,'' Mr. Nasrat explained. ''I would give free food to other Mets fans, but I don't see any around today.''</p>
        <p>There were, in fact, a handful of Mets fans who braved the parade, including the somewhat suicidal troupe of teenage boys, shoving through the crowd and making public their unkind appraisals of the Yankees and their fans.</p>
        <p>Their antics, of course, were not received lightly. They were pelted with empty plastic bottles of iced tea and Gatorade. They were described in language too vulgar to be printed in a family newspaper. Their mothers, suffice to say, were defamed.</p>
        <p>The Stage Door Deli III sits on Vesey Street between Broadway and Church Street and offered Neil Bouton some refuge from the ignominy of the parade. Mr. Bouton, 72, has been rooting for the Mets since they entered the major leagues in 1962 and was staving off the pain of a Yankee victory with a bottle of domestic beer. It was his fourth since 1 p.m.</p>
        <p>''In about two or three more rounds, I'll start thinking the Mets actually won this thing,'' Mr. Bouton, a retired steamfitter, chortled as he shook loose a cigarette from his crumpled pack. ''Then I figure I'll be good to go out on the streets, but not a moment before.''</p>
        <p>Up the block, Dickie Richards, an 18-year-old Yankee fan from Tarrytown, N.Y., experienced an unfortunate case of mistaken identity when he dropped his 40-ounce bottle of Budweiser on the sidewalk and the beer went everywhere, including down the front of his khaki pants. The crowd treated him to a round of withering insults that assailed his family and his manhood before things really got out of hand.</p>
        <p>''Mets fan!'' someone shouted as a mortified Mr. Richards tried to dry the stain. ''There's a drunk Mets fan over here!''</p>
        <p>With the alleys and avenues of the financial district absolutely teeming with Yankee fans -- not to mention street vendors hawking Yankee regalia for each and every part of the body -- some Mets fans thought it best to escape to the shelter of the subways.</p>
        <p>At the Cortlandt Street station, Jean Laughton, 38, was just getting off the train on her way to a job interview with a financial services company. When the doors of her subway car opened, she was nearly washed back inside by the tide of loudly cheering Yankee fans who were piling onto the train.</p>
        <p>''It's bad enough they won the Series, but do they have to be so obnoxious about it?'' Ms. Laughton, of Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y., wondered. ''You can't escape these fools anywhere -- not even underground.''</p>
