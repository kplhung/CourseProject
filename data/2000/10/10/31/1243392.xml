        <p>When the Nets' practice ended in Continental Arena on Saturday, a technician, as if on cue, suddenly shut the lights off and warmed them up again as a test.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, point guard Stephon Marbury, in semidarkness just off the court, discussed how he can flip a switch when the regular season begins. No sense in wasting electricity on games that do not matter.</p>
        <p>Today, after the Nets' final preseason practice, the natural lights in Marbury's eyes were buzzing for Tuesday night's season opener here against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He will not wait until Tuesday morning to prepare mentally for his fifth season in the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>''From now on, I'm ready,'' Marbury said firmly at 1:30 this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Marbury, a 23-year-old Brooklyn native, the premier pure point guard in the Eastern Conference, had had enough of the questions about his intensity. Nets Coach Byron Scott criticized him last week, saying that Marbury was coasting through the preseason. Marbury assured him repeatedly since then that he would be ready.</p>
        <p>Last season, Marbury scored 39 points on opening night against Indiana -- a franchise record for an opener -- albeit in the first of 51 losses for the Nets.</p>
        <p>''I keep reminding him, 'You guaranteed me you'd be ready,' '' Scott said jokingly today. Then Scott grew serious: ''And I believe it. I know what type of kid he is and I know he's looking forward to it. This is a new beginning for all of us.''</p>
        <p>The Nets' ''new beginning'' theme always plays at this time of year, but this time, the rookie coach and his collection of young and hungry starters are singing it loudly.</p>
        <p>Scott will start the No. 1 draft pick, Kenyon Martin, at power forward; the surprising rookie free agent who did not go to college, Stephen Jackson, at small forward; last year's second-round draft pick, Evan Eschmeyer, at center; and the 11th-year veteran Kendall Gill, back at shooting guard as a stabilizing force.</p>
        <p>Marbury, entering his second full season since Minnesota traded him to the Nets in March 1999, must set the pace and tone for a team brimming with potential but also burdened by injuries. If he continues to score his 20-plus points a night, then the Nets have a chance to win. And the relationship is symbiotic; if the Nets win, he may make his first All-Star appearance.</p>
        <p>''He has a lot more maturity,'' said Gill, who shot 62 percent from the field in four preseason games. ''He now thinks he doesn't have to take everything all upon himself, which makes him better. Steph's an All-Star in our minds and he should have made the All-Star team last year. That's a lesson he should have learned. Winners get everything.''</p>
        <p>Marbury, who averaged 22.2 points and 8.4 assists last season, was named to the third-team all-N.B.A. squad as the Nets went 31-51. But today, he played down his All-Star hopes.</p>
        <p>''I'm not even thinking that,'' he said. ''I just want to go to the playoffs. I'm tired of watching other people play. It's not fun at all.''</p>
        <p>Asked why he believes the Nets will make the playoffs this season, he responded, ''We are a lot better than we were last year and we are way better prepared.''</p>
        <p>The Nets will open against the Cavaliers, whom they beat, 91-83, in an exhibition game on Friday. Cleveland has a rising young point guard in Andre Miller. And while injuries have hurt that franchise, too, the 7-foot-3-inch Zydrunas Ilgauskas, is still healthy. Miller and Ilgauskas are the key to a roster heavy with veterans like the former Nets Chris Gatling and Clarence Weatherspoon, and Scott is wary of the Cavs' physical defensive presence.</p>
        <p>The Nets cut their roster to 12 today, waiving the veteran Elliot Perry and the rookie Kevin Freeman, but will dress just 11 players Tuesday because guard Lucious Harris is recovering from hernia surgery and forward Keith Van Horn is out with a broken leg for at least the next three weeks.</p>
        <p>Despite the inexperience around them, Marbury and Scott do not seem concerned.</p>
        <p>''I feel very comfortable because I know I've still got some good veteran guys coming off the bench,'' the coach said.</p>
        <p>Scott does not put Marbury in the veteran category just yet.</p>
        <p>''I think he still has a long way to go for him to be exactly what I want him to be on the floor,'' Scott said. ''But I have to realize that Stephon is only 23 years old. Even though he's been in the league four years, he's still a young guy; he has a lot to learn about the game also. But there's still nobody better at that position. Maybe Jason Kidd or Gary Payton; besides that, there's really nobody better. I know he'll grow into the position.''</p>
        <p>This off-season, Marbury worked diligently at the Nets' practice facility, studying Scott's play book. He has been calling the coach frequently at home with questions, and they have developed a rapport.</p>
        <p>Off the court, Marbury has parted with the agent David Falk. Frustrated by his lack of endorsements, Marbury signed with the Wilhelmina Modeling Agency, which is coming closer to negotiating new deals for him.</p>
        <p>But Marbury knows the easiest sell on the market. ''Winning,'' he said, ''is everything.''</p>
