        <p>Just like everybody else along the route of the Yankee victory parade yesterday, Gary Pavan used his lung power to try to get some attention from his favorite players.</p>
        <p>''Hey Tino! Tino Martinez!'' he screamed.</p>
        <p>''Hey Andy! Hey Andy Pettitte!'' he blared.</p>
        <p>''Hey Mariano! Over here!'' he barked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavan, an information technology specialist at an accounting firm, may have been just another voice in the crowd, one of many thousands with hopes of getting a nod or wave from his favorite players.  But what Mr. Pavan, 29, had that most other people didn't was two years' experience as a float driver in Yankee championship parades. With that access, he scored not just nods and waves but four A-list Yankee autographs on the souvenir baseballs he brought in his pockets.</p>
        <p>''I got my goal!'' he boasted. ''Denny Neagle, Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera and Roger Clemens.''</p>
        <p>With two previous parades under his belt, Mr. Pavan came armed with just the right inside information. He knew who was autograph-friendly (Rivera) and who was not, so there was no wasted time. He knew who had a security detail too tight to infiltrate (Derek Jeter), so he didn't bother to try. He said he knew who are among the nice guys (Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez) and who would rather not be bothered (he wouldn't name names so as not to slander anyone on his favorite team).</p>
        <p>And most important, he knew that access is best as the players begin to board the floats. The police phalanxes had yet to form and the players' moods were light. That is when a baseball lifted high into the air has the best chance of being picked, signed and gloriously returned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavan, a private contractor from Montclair, N.J., who often does work for a company that supplies floats and drivers for parades, was already gathering intelligence in case the Yankees win again next year. He noticed yesterday how David Justice wandered around the lineup area, sans entourage, videotaping the crowd -- and he made a mental note of it.</p>
