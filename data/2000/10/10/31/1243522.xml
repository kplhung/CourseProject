        <p>But the two dozen members of the  New York City Correction Department pipe band were fixated on another force of nature: the strong wind and the grief it was giving them as it blew through their kilts. While legions of Yankee lovers were just beginning to plot their route to the parade, the band had arrived in Bryant Park, one of the staging areas, at 6 a.m. By 11 a.m., the band members were shivering as the temperature barely topped 40 degrees and praying for an end to the wind and the Yankee love fest.</p>
        <p>''Nothing like marching up the Canyon of Heroes with the wind blowing up your kilt,'' said Bob Shaw, a 47-year-old warden at Rikers Island and the only band member who bothered to show any Yankee support, with his withered cap, which some in the band joked about. ''We're New Yorkers,'' he said huddling with six other band mates who chugged hot chocolate and marched in place to keep warm. ''We got to show a little support, right?''</p>
        <p>His band mates didn't buy it. ''I'm out here freezing in a kilt and no underwear,'' said Scott Smiley, 35, a correction officer from Long Island.  ''Only thing that that would made this exciting is if they did it on a Saturday. At least I would got a little overtime.''</p>
