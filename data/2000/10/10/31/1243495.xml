        <p>Re ''Extinction Turns Out to Be a Slow, Slow Process'' (Oct. 24): It would have been nice to have seen some examples from the world's oceans, as much of what was discussed for land-bound phenomena is also a hot topic in the sea. I and colleagues (Jonathan Geller, Marjorie Reaka-Kudla and Elliott Norse) published an essay last year in The Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics titled ''Historical Extinction in the Sea.'' In it, we noted the concept of ''functional extinction'' or the ''living dead,''  which occurs when a species is sufficiently reduced in number that it no longer plays a role in the ecosystem. We also discuss the concept of trying to determine extinctions in coral reefs using the classic species-area curves.</p>

        <p>Some biologists stress that concern over the current turmoil in the natural world should be tempered with the awareness that change -- including extinctions and bursts of speciation -- is an essential part of the ferment of life on earth.</p>
        <p>Some of us feel that extinctions, invasions and other phenomena have been with us since the beginning and that humans are simply speeding up what happens anyway.</p>
        <p>DR JAMES T. CARLTON  Bodega Bay, Calif.</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of marine sciences at Williams College.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 6, 2000, Monday  Because of an editing error, a letter to the editor in Science Times on Tuesday from Dr. James T. Carleton about the extinction and invasion of species referred incompletely to his view on the role of humans in the processes. In addition to believing that humans are speeding extinctions and invasions, he believes they are responsible for many changes that would not otherwise occur.</p>
