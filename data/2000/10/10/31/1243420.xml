        <p>The odds against Globalstar avoiding the path to bankruptcy court taken last year by two other companies that sought to provide satellite phone service -- Iridium L.L.C. and ICO Global Communications -- got a little steeper yesterday.</p>
        <p>Investors fled the already beaten down stock and bonds of Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd., the Bermuda-based operating arm of Globalstar L.L.C., after it reported disappointing third-quarter earnings. The earnings were bad enough, but many investors were even more unnerved when Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman and chief executive of Loral Space and Communications, Globalstar's largest shareholder, was quoted as saying that Loral would not make any further sacrifices to bail out the $4.3 billion venture.</p>
        <p>Loral, which has a 38 percent stake in Globalstar, has sunk more than $1 billion into the system and will soon put up another $500 million to cover loans it guaranteed.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with analysts and institutional investors yesterday, Mr. Schwartz argued that his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he believed Globalstar was now on the road to success. But analysts said that the negative pall cast by comments attributed to him in a Wall Street Journal article yesterday would make it that much harder for Globalstar to attract the customers it desperately needs in large numbers.</p>
        <p>Analysts vary in their estimates of how big a customer base Globalstar needs to survive, but none of them expect it to do so if it cannot grow much faster than it did in the three months ending Sept. 30, when it added just under 10,000 subscribers to reach a total of 21,300.</p>
        <p>''Globalstar needs 1.6 million customers just to cover its costs and service its debt,'' said Marc Nabi, a telecommunications and satellite analyst with Merrill Lynch who advised shareholders yesterday that the company's stock was worthless.</p>
        <p>The Globalstar partnership reported a net loss for the third quarter of $219 million, which translates to $1 a share of Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd.</p>
        <p>Net revenue for the period, including royalty income from phone sales and less discounts and promotions, was $1,190,000, versus $708,000 in the prior quarter.</p>
        <p>The major outstanding financial question, Mr. Nabi said, is whether Globalstar's network of 52 satellites, ground stations and the licenses it holds for the radio spectrum in which it operates are worth enough to largely compensate bondholders and other creditors in a bankruptcy proceding.</p>
        <p>Various bond traders said yesterday that Globalstar bonds were trading at 8 to 13 cents on the dollar, a price many analysts believe is far below the value of the company's assets.</p>
        <p>''Someone buying at 8 cents is in good shape,'' Mr. Nabi said. ''If they bought at 50 cents, I'm not so sure.''</p>
        <p>Globalstar's system is thought to be more valuable than Iridium's because the satellites have better data-handling capability and are newer. However, unlike Iridium, Globalstar does not yet have the security clearances needed to attract the federal government as a major customer. Nor does it cover portions of the oceans and high latitudes it would need to stack up well against existing networks like Inmarsat that are widely used by cargo haulers, international air carriers and multinational oil companies.</p>
        <p>''This is more evidence that while satellites are well suited for broadcasting to many points, it is hard to make a business using them for point-to-point communication,'' said J. Armand Musey, who follows the industry for Banc of America Securities.</p>
        <p>In over-the-counter trading, Globalstar's shares fell $3.63, or 60 percent, to $2.38, making them the biggest percentage loser in the American market. That sinking feeling is all too familiar to Globalstar shareholders, who have experienced the stock's tumble from a high last Jan. 3 of $53.75.</p>
        <p>Qualcomm, a big investor and supplier to Globalstar, was also caught in the downdraft, falling $6.75, to  $68.13. Loral dropped 19 cents, to $5.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the most recent decline could throw a wrench in Globalstar's plans to raise $105 million by selling shares to the Bear Stearns Companies. The plan was based on Globalstar selling the shares at prices low enough to allow Bear Stearns to immediately resell them -- in essence, it paid Bear Stearns for distributing to investors shares Globalstar would be unable to sell in a public offering.</p>
        <p>But at the current prices Bear Stearns is free to back out of the arrangement. Analysts said unless the stock climbs back, Globalstar might be stuck $70 million short of its $105 million goal. Without the full $105 million, analysts said the company could run out of money as early as the end of March instead of in May as currently projected.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Schwartz called the third-quarter growth ''unacceptably slow,'' he did his best to dispel the gloomy outlook. He said he expected  Globalstar to demonstrate by May that is attractive enough for investors to continue supporting it. He refused to say Loral would not put more money into the venture in such conditions.</p>
        <p>''Globalstar is not on life support,'' he said, citing its growing coverage of the globe as more ground gateways are brought into service; the increase in billable minutes from 1.1 million in the second quarter to 2.3 billion in the third quarter; and a number of agreements Mr. Schwartz said would support the venture's new emphasis on signing up corporate and government users who might order hundreds or even thousands of phones.</p>
