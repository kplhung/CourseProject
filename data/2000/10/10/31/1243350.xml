        <p>Likening the situation to the early days of the mad cow epidemic in Britain, some biologists say American hunters should be warned about a similar malady that has infected wild deer and elk in parts of Colorado and Wyoming.</p>
        <p>The malady is called chronic wasting disease. While no cases of human disease have been directly traced to deer or elk meat, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that it could happen. And with the hunting season in full swing, a number of scientists are calling for more action to warn hunters about the potential problem.</p>
        <p>Both mad cow disease and chronic wasting disease are believed to be caused by aberrant proteins, called infectious prions, which affect the brain, destroying tissue and leaving it with sponge-like holes. When the cow disease first appeared in Britain in the mid-1980's, government agriculture and health officials initially offered assurances that it could not spread to people.</p>
        <p>By now, though, 77 Britons have died of a related brain disorder that they are believed to have contracted from consuming affected meat. It is not known how many others may ultimately fall ill and die.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the British government destroyed almost four million cattle to stem the spread of the disease. But last week a three-year investigation into the causes of the epidemic severely criticized the government's ''culture of secrecy'' in not being more honest with the public, and for using ''an approach whose object was sedation.''</p>
        <p>Wildlife officials in Colorado and Wyoming, where the chronic wasting disease is firmly entrenched along their shared border and is estimated to affect 1 percent of elk and from 6 percent to 15 percent of deer, insist that not enough is known about the problem to cancel hunting permits.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mike Williams, a veterinarian at the Colorado Department of Wildlife in Fort Collins said, ''We don't think the problem is a big deal.''  Areas where the disease is endemic are not closed to hunting, nor is there a need to close them, he said. ''If people choose to hunt there, it is their choice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Instead, hunters are advised by state wildlife officials to avoid obviously sick animals and to use rubber gloves in cutting up all carcasses, particularly brain and nervous tissues where the infectious prions apparently concentrate. But people familiar with hunting practices in those areas say hunters are not taking even these precautions.</p>
        <p>''Around here, people are not knowledgeable about the disease or just don't care,'' Arnold Hale, a retired hunting outfitter from Livermore, Colo., said in a telephone interview. ''When you talk to hunters, most don't trust the government. I don't know anyone taking precautions.''</p>
        <p>Kurt Zunker, 28, a probation officer from Cheyenne, Wyo., who is an avid hunter, said: ''I'm aware of the situation but not really abreast to the complete ramifications of it. It won't stop me from hunting.''</p>
        <p>Mad cow disease and chronic wasting disease are among a bizarre class of prion-caused disorders known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or T.S.E.'s. The aberrant protein molecules are folded abnormally, which seems to endow them with their ability to cause disease. Sometimes they seem to misfold all on their own. In other cases, the misfolded proteins are transmitted via food, blood transfusions or surgical instruments.</p>
        <p>Transmission is difficult to track, however, because people or animals typically develop the disease a long time after they have been exposed to the misfolded prions. Until a few years ago, for example, it was widely believed that each animal, including humans, had its own unique form of T.S.E. and that the diseases rarely passed between species.</p>
        <p>But in 1996, when young Britons began dying from a particularly rapid human form of the disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or C.J.D., the species barrier began to crumble. Until then C.J.D. was diagnosed exclusively in much older people. Tests soon revealed that the disease was a new variant of C.J.D. that could be traced directly to eating cattle infected with mad cow disease.</p>
        <p>In recent months, researchers have discovered that a prion from hamsters, thought never to infect mice, not only replicates profusely in mice but it does so without producing disease symptoms. In other words, mice can be silent carriers of a disease that originated in hamsters.  When subsequent generations of mice are exposed to blood or nervous tissues from silent carrier mice, they get the disease. Other experiments carried out in the United States show that the deer or elk prion in chronic wasting disease can convert healthy human prions into infectious prions in test tubes. The conversion rate is slow but certain.</p>
        <p>The best available science shows that chronic wasting disease can infect human tissue but wildlife officials are carrying on with ''business as usual,'' said Dr. Tom Pringle, a biologist in Eugene, Ore., who closely follows T.S.E. worldwide and independently studies the disease.</p>
        <p>''Who'd want hamburger from a cow where 15 percent of the herd had mad cow disease?'' Dr. Pringle asked. ''Who'd want mutton from a sheep where 15 percent of the sheep had scrapie? To me it looks like Russian roulette for hunters.''</p>
        <p>Most Americans don't understand how dangerous these diseases really are, Dr. Pringle said. It is extremely difficult to kill infectious prions that have come into contact with surgical instruments, yet some hunter who is ''tired, cold, hungry and drunk'' will cut off a deer head, handle the animal's spinal cord and ''stick his hunting knife back into his scabbard,'' he said. That knife could spread disease.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pringle strongly criticizes wildlife officials as downplaying the seriousness of chronic wasting disease. Just as British agricultural officials initially acted to protect the image of the cattle industry -- one even fed hamburger to his 4-year-old daughter on television to prove beef was safe -- American wildlife officials are acting to shield hunting and fishing, he said. Fishing and hunting license fees provide a substantial portion of their agencies' income.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Elizabeth Williams, a veterinarian at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and a leading researcher on chronic wasting disease, said that hunters are not going to be deterred until there is much better evidence that chronic wasting disease in deer and elk is a danger to people. The prevalence and incidence of chronic wasting disease has not changed much over the past several years, she said. And it is still not known how one animal passes the disease to another, much less if humans face more than a theoretical risk.</p>
        <p>Hunters, many of whom come from other states, are given a 54-page brochure that describes chronic wasting disease, Dr. Miller said, and on page 9 they are advised to avoid coming into contact with brain, spinal cord, eyes, spleen or lymph nodes of any deer or elk they might kill. The brochure states that ''it is unlikely that chronic wasting disease is naturally transmissible to humans.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, some Colorado wildlife officials have suggested killing 50 percent of the deer in the north-central part of the state where more of the deer are infected, Mr. Hale said. ''They want to kill them and start over,'' he said. But he added that they do not think the disease threatens hunters. ''It would have shown up by now'' in people, he said.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Mr. Zunker went elk hunting about 15 miles from his home not far from the state border, an area where rates of chronic wasting disease are high.</p>
        <p>''I talked to a game warden the other day and he didn't mention anything to me about a problem in that area,'' he said. ''I don't get overly concerned. I don't know if Game and Fish have done a good job of informing the public. But if it's a true threat, how come they haven't reduced hunting quotas?''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 1, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times yesterday about a brain disease in some deer and elk misstated the surname of a veterinarian at the Colorado Department of Wildlife who doubted the need to close affected areas to hunters. He is Dr. Mike Miller, not Williams.</p>
