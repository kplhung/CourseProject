        <p>The Microsoft Corporation asked a federal appeals court today to forbid nine organizations and individuals who support the government antitrust suit against the company, including America Online, to file court briefs in the case.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, Microsoft stated in a three-page brief it filed this morning, all nine should be asked to combine their thoughts into one 25-page brief.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is considering the appeal of the antitrust ruling last spring against Microsoft.</p>
        <p>The court asked Microsoft and the government to comment today on whether the individuals and groups hoping to file briefs should be permitted to do so.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department filed a two-paragraph brief saying, in essence, that the court should feel free to accept any brief from any party that ''it would find helpful.''</p>
        <p>That is not surprising, since nine groups asked to file briefs that appeared likely to support the government's case, while only two have come forward in support of Microsoft. Those two are trade groups: the Association for Competitive Technology, which is partly financed by Microsoft, and the Computing Technology Industry Association.</p>
        <p>Microsoft asserted that the nine groups and individuals supporting the government's case either had no particular unique knowledge in the case, or were strong competitors or representatives of competitors.</p>
        <p>Microsoft objected specifically to America Online. AOL now owns Netscape Communications, Microsoft's main rival in the market for Internet browsers.</p>
        <p>''To the extent AOL has any 'unique expertise' regarding the technical issues in this case, that 'factual perspective' is already reflected in the record,'' Microsoft stated. ''AOL and Netscape witnesses testified extensively at trial, and it would be totally improper for AOL to attempt to supplement their testimony now with additional facts outside the record.''</p>
        <p>Also included among the nine are the Computer and Communications Association, the Software and Information Industry Association and several private individuals.</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGY  Correction:  November 4, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a request from Microsoft to limit briefs in its antitrust case referred incorrectly to those whose briefs the company opposed. Not all supported the government; two groups -- the Association for Objective Law and the Center for the Moral Defense of Capitalism -- sought to file in support of Microsoft. Later developments are reported today on Page C4.</p>
