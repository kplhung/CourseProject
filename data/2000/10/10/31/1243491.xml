        <p>Two leading creative executives are taking new posts.</p>
        <p>Steven Landsberg, who in August left as co-chief creative officer at the New York office of DDB Worldwide, is becoming executive vice president at McCann-Erickson North America and senior creative director at McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group in New York.</p>
        <p>The move reunites Mr. Landsberg, 42, with Jonathan Cranin, an executive vice president and regional chief creative officer at McCann, to whom Mr. Landsberg will report; they worked together from 1993 to 1995 at Wells Rich Greene BDDP in New York, an agency that has since closed. DDB is part of the Omnicom Group, and McCann is a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>And Joe Sciarrotta was named to the new post of executive creative director at the Chicago office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group; he will lead the office with Linda Garrison, managing director. Mr. Sciarrotta, 38, had most recently been a Chicago-based freelancer for Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of Omnicom. He has also worked at DDB Chicago and the Leap Partnership in Chicago, part of Leapnet Inc.</p>
