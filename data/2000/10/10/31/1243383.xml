        <p>Dick Cheney struck back today at Democrats who questioned whether his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, was ready to be president, saying it is the Democratic ticket that lacked experience and asserting that Vice President Al Gore was ''not up to the task'' of being the nation's commander in chief.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, made the accusation one day after his Democratic counterpart, Senator Joseph I.

        <p>Dick Cheney struck back today at Democrats who questioned whether his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, was ready to be president, saying it is the Democratic ticket that lacked experience and asserting that Vice President Al Gore was ''not up to the task'' of being the nation's commander in chief.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, made the accusation one day after his Democratic counterpart, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said on national television that he did not believe that Mr. Bush was ready to be president. At a rally at a small college here, Mr. Cheney disparaged Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman as lifelong politicians who are dependent on government paychecks.</p>
        <p>''The guys on the other side talk about experience, and what kind of experience they might bring to this little venture called governing the nation,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''And I thought I'd talk about that for just a moment today, because if there's some ticket -- one of the two tickets -- lacking in experience, it seems to me it's those guys, who have spent virtually their entire careers in elective office, getting paid by the government, never having met a payroll, living inside the Beltway in Washington, D.C.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney spent 25 years in government -- a year longer than Mr. Gore -- serving as President Gerald R. Ford's chief of staff, being elected six times as Wyoming's lone congressman, and as defense secretary in the Persian Gulf war. When President George Bush lost his bid for re-election in 1992, Mr. Cheney joined a research organization before taking the helm at  Halliburton, an oil services company.</p>
        <p>''Now, I'm proud of my national experience and public service,'' Mr. Cheney said here at Loras College. ''Al Gore and Joe Lieberman ought to be proud of their service, too, but I think it's rather limited, frankly. Neither one of 'em ever ran anything, neither one of 'em ever made a payroll, as best I can tell. And the world looks different if you've had to go out into the private sector.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore worked as a journalist for five years before becoming a congressman from Tennessee, and Mr. Lieberman was a lawyer in Connecticut before he became a senator. Mr. Cheney's running mate, Mr. Bush, worked in the oil industry and was a part-owner of the Texas Rangers before he became governor.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign seemed to be happy to discuss which candidate is more qualified to be the president. ''Our problem with Governor Bush's experience is not the jobs he's had but how he's done them,'' said Kym Spell, a campaign spokeswoman. ''We have a problem when you promise a Texas miracle in education that turns out to be a myth, when you appoint polluters to run environmental agencies, and when you deliver tax cuts for big oil instead of insuring health care for children.''</p>
        <p>At the rally, Mr. Cheney also delivered a stinging rebuke of the vice president. ''A man like Al Gore, who doesn't seem to know the difference between whether or not the forces are in good shape today and doesn't seem willing to have a discussion about it, is not up to the task, in my opinion, of being commander in chief of this nation's armed forces,'' Mr. Cheney said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spell countered, ''I think I'll leave it to the American people to decide who's more ready to be commander in chief.''</p>
