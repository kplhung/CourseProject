        <p>For the moment, at least, it appears Missouri may elect Mel Carnahan as its next senator, even though Mr. Carnahan, the state's popular governor, died in a plane crash two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>To the surprise of Republicans and Democrats alike, the dead Democratic challenger seems to be holding his own and possibly even pulling ahead in the polls over the living Republican incumbent, Senator John Ashcroft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashcroft generally led in the polls when his opponent was alive. After the crash, when it was too late to replace Mr. Carnahan on the ballot, most analysts conceded the race to Mr. Ashcroft. He even stopped campaigning for 10 days, saying it would be disrespectful of the dead.</p>
        <p>But in that period, the momentum began to shift. Signs and stickers began appearing throughout the state, saying: ''I'm still with Mel'' and ''Don't let the fire go out.'' Suddenly he was staying even in the polls, and then even pulling ahead in some surveys after the state's new governor, a Democrat, floated the idea that he would like to name Jean Carnahan, the candidate's widow, to the seat if her husband won the election.</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Carnahan announced that she would ''do what Mel would have wanted me to do'' and said she would pick up his political mantle and would serve in the Senate if her husband won next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carnahan, who at 66 has never held public office, made the announcement at the family farmhouse here in southeastern Missouri. ''While we grieve the loss of the man whose life and vision inspired us all, this campaign was never about just one person,'' she said. ''It was about giving a voice in the United States Senate to the everyday working families of Missouri, especially to the children.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carnahan said, ''Should the people elect my husband, I pledge to take our common dreams to the United States Senate.''</p>
        <p>When Governor Carnahan died on Oct. 16, along with his son and a friend, National Democratic party officials despaired that they had lost an opportunity to pick up the seat in a year when control of the Senate might be up for grabs. The Carnahan Senate campaign withdrew all of its planned advertising and received refunds for time already bought on local television stations.</p>
        <p>But, while Mr. Ashcroft suspended his campaign as a sign of mourning, Democrats began rethinking their initial judgment that the seat was lost. Then, after Gov. Roger Wilson, a Democrat who had been Mr. Carnahan's lieutenant governor, said he would like to name Mrs. Carnahan, some polls showed something that surprised everybody.</p>
        <p>A poll done for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and St. Louis television station KMOV last weekend showed that the Carnahan name on the ballot outpolled Mr. Ashcroft 47.2 percent to 45.4 percent. With a four-point margin of error, that was the equivalent of a tie. The newspaper said today that when voters were told that Mrs. Carnahan had been asked to serve in her husband's place if he won, the margin increased to five points -- 49.4 percent to 44.3 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashcroft's aides have acknowledged that he finds himself in  awkward situation. When he resumed his campaigning, he said it was appropriate to let the voters know of his stands on the issues.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Ashcroft was aiming his sights at the White House, hoping to be the Republican nominee for the presidency. Today, he was campaigning in Columbia, looking nonplused when asked about Mrs. Carnahan's expected announcement.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Carnahan has always been kind to me,'' he said, groping for a response. ''She's written and said things that are very kind about me.''</p>
        <p>He said Mrs. Carnahan had praised his work on the issues of welfare and education and added, ''This has been an unusual campaign  and it's been a tragic campaign filled with sorrow.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Senator Ashcroft's comments, Mrs. Carnahan said she was puzzled. ''I've been occupied with my husband's campaign,'' she said. ''I don't think I've ever campaigned for Mr. Ashcroft.''</p>
        <p>Questioned gently by reporters about her qualifications, Mrs. Carnahan said, ''Jean Carnahan, I think, is someone who worked behind the scenes much of the time. We worked as partners.''</p>
        <p>She said that she was not a ''rearrange-the-furniture'' kind of state first lady and that she and her husband ''sat many hours in the kitchen here and talked about his dreams.'' She is the author of three books, all of which highlight her role as helpmate to Mr. Carnahan. One recounts the history of the Governor's Mansion, while the other is about entertaining at Christmastime.</p>
        <p>Asked whether she would actively campaign, she replied: ''Not in the traditional sense.'' But she said she would find a way to let people know that a vote for Mel Carnahan ''is legal and the proper way to carry his ideals forward.''</p>
        <p>Roy Temple, the Missouri Democratic chairman, said in an interview that it remained unclear whether an advertising campaign would be resurrected or what active role Mrs. Carnahan might play. He said the campaign would try to send a message that voting for Mr. Carnahan was not a wasted vote. ''That's the message,'' he said. ''Who the messenger is and how we send that message is still undecided.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carnahan said that no one had urged her to accept Governor Wilson's offer and that she had made her own decision. She said she was inspired to make her decision in part by recent remarks by Cokie Roberts, a television journalist, in which Ms. Roberts recalled how her father, Representative Hale Boggs, was killed in a plane crash in 1972 and was succeeded in Congress by her mother, Lindy Boggs. Mrs. Carnahan said she was moved by Ms. Roberts's assertion that her mother's decision helped her deal with her grief.</p>
        <p>The widows of three congressmen are currently members of the House: Mary Bono, a California Republican, Lois Capps, a California Democrat, and Jo Ann Emerson, a Missouri Republican. All three were first elected in special contests to succeed their husbands, and all have since won re-election and are running again this year.</p>
