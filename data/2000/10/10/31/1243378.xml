        <p>Editorial says Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus was legitimately elected president in 1994, but since then, with support from Russia, he has amassed near absolute powers, permitting little dissent or private enterprise; notes he openly admires Hitler and says Belarussians want him to bring back Stalinist state; says opposition forces in Belarus are not unified enough to translate this frustration into political power; hopes they work together to defeat Lukashenko when he runs for re-election year from now</p>

        <p>The fall of Slobodan Milosevic has left Europe with a single dictator, Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus. He was legitimately elected president of the former Soviet republic in 1994, running as a 39-year-old anti-corruption crusader. But, with support from Russia, Mr. Lukashenko has since amassed near absolute powers, permitting little dissent or private enterprise. He openly admires Hitler and has said that Belarussians want him to bring back a Stalinist state.</p>
        <p>This month's parliamentary elections offered a tidy illustration of Mr. Lukashenko's control, which is even tighter than the hold that Mr. Milosevic once had on Serbia. Dozens of independent candidates for Parliament -- a powerless body -- were disqualified on technicalities, and those who remained were labeled criminals and junkies by state television. Advocates of an opposition boycott of the election were arrested. Several opposition leaders are missing. While Mr. Milosevic allowed some independent broadcasting, in Belarus the only opposition voices belong to a few small newspapers.</p>

        <p>The fall of Slobodan Milosevic has left Europe with a single dictator, Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus. He was legitimately elected president of the former Soviet republic in 1994, running as a 39-year-old anti-corruption crusader. But, with support from Russia, Mr. Lukashenko has since amassed near absolute powers, permitting little dissent or private enterprise. He openly admires Hitler and has said that Belarussians want him to bring back a Stalinist state.</p>
        <p>This month's parliamentary elections offered a tidy illustration of Mr. Lukashenko's control, which is even tighter than the hold that Mr. Milosevic once had on Serbia. Dozens of independent candidates for Parliament -- a powerless body -- were disqualified on technicalities, and those who remained were labeled criminals and junkies by state television. Advocates of an opposition boycott of the election were arrested. Several opposition leaders are missing. While Mr. Milosevic allowed some independent broadcasting, in Belarus the only opposition voices belong to a few small newspapers.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Lukashenko is a lonely throwback, there is little chance he will be toppled soon. The 10 million people of Belarus are more isolated from the modern world and dependent on the state than nearly all other Europeans. Belarus was long an agrarian and industrial heartland of the Soviet Union, and many older people want to reunite with Russia. Mr. Lukashenko advocates this, too, probably because he dreams of ruling a larger kingdom.</p>
        <p>His relationship with Moscow is key to his hold on power. Under Mr. Lukashenko, Belarus provides Moscow with radar stations close to NATO nations and a safe conduit for a planned gas pipeline from Russia to the West. If the two countries reunite, Russia could establish a greater military presence in Belarus and satisfy the dreams of some in Russia who want to rebuild the Soviet Union. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, congratulated Mr. Lukashenko on a ''free and fair'' vote for Parliament. Such backing shields Mr. Lukashenko from other foreign pressure, gives him legitimacy at home and props up the economy with energy and other aid.</p>
        <p>More surprising, Germany is flirting with Mr. Lukashenko, according to opposition leaders in Belarus. German diplomats in Belarus promote German investment and engagement with the government. As long as Moscow supports Mr. Lukashenko, Germany argues, one must work with him.</p>
        <p>Moscow, however, can afford to let Belarussians choose their own leader -- most opposition politicians believe a close relationship with Russia is necessary. But union with an unreformed Belarus would further cripple Russia's economy.</p>
        <p>There is discontent in Belarus, but opposition forces have not been unified enough to translate this frustration into political power. That may change. The nine major opposition groupings have agreed, in theory, to work together. That is the only chance to defeat Mr. Lukashenko when he runs for re-election a year from now.</p>
