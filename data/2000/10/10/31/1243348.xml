        <p>Attention deficit disorder is a good thing?</p>
        <p>Michael Zane, the kinetic founder of the Kryptonite Bike Lock Corporation, believes it is.</p>
        <p>After fighting what had been diagnosed as depression for most of his life, Mr. Zane was told by a psychiatrist six years ago that the true diagnosis was attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, known as A.D./H.D., or A.D.D. Mr. Zane was 46 at the time, and the psychiatrist prescribed a combination of Ritalin and Prozac.</p>
        <p>His considerable energy harnessed, his self-esteem improved, Mr. Zane now attributes his business success to the disorder. ''I've always been able to do more and think faster and in more directions at once than most people,'' said Mr. Zane, who owns homes in Brookline, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard. ''Now that I know why, I don't think I could have been as successful without it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, so convinced is he of the disorder's benefits that he is writing a book tentatively called ''Running Around Your Backhand: A Successful Entrepreneur's Guide to Leveraging A.D.D. to Your Advantage.''</p>
        <p>And why not? Mr. Zane joins an increasing number of people, including mental health professionals, who suggest that having the disorder may explain their extraordinary abilities, and may even improve their lives.</p>
        <p>''I am so glad I have A.D.D.!'' Dr. Lynn Weiss, a psychotherapist, writes in ''A.D.D. on the Job: Making Your A.D.D. Work for You,'' one of several books she has written on A.D.D. since 1991, including ''A.D.D. on the Job,'' ''A.D.D. and Creativity'' and ''A.D.D. and Success.''</p>
        <p>''The way I see it,'' Dr. Weiss said, ''I possess special skills and strengths because of A.D.D., and with those skills I have been able to experience life in Technicolor.''</p>
        <p>Others agree.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bonnie Cramond, an associate professor of educational psychology at the University of Georgia, has written about overlapping similarities in the behavioral descriptions of creativity and the disorder. ''For a lot of people,'' Dr. Cramond said, ''having A.D.D. means they have a different way of thinking that can be beneficial. For example, with people who are marked by rapid ideation, some may say that's not focusing, but in many situations coming up with a lot of ideas is helpful.''</p>
        <p>In his book ''Attention Deficit Disorder: A Different Perception'' Thom Hartmann, a psychotherapist in Northfield, Vt., proposes an anthropological theory that the traits of the disorder were vital in early hunting societies. To survive, he says, those societies needed distractible, impulsive, quick thinking decision makers. The traits became a mixed blessing only when societies turned agrarian, Mr. Hartmann argues.</p>
        <p>But, he adds, those traits associated with the disorder become highly valued in certain professions, like detectives, emergency room workers, air traffic controllers, race car drivers and Internet entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Russell Barkley, a professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, dismisses the theory as a common but false myth.</p>
        <p>Dr. Barkley, the author of 14 books on the disorder, said: ''This trend of making A.D.D. seem an advantage is highly detrimental. In hundreds of research studies, there is not one shred of evidence that confers anyone with A.D.D. with an increased ability in creativity, intelligence or motor skills. I categorically reject, among other myths, that people with A.D.D. are better, for example, at multitasking. I understand that this may be an effort to counter a history of low self-esteem among people trying to cope with the effects of A.D.D., but this sort of folk lore is a dangerous thing.''</p>
        <p>The trend to portray the disorder as desirable may be a result of a continuing lack of conclusive information about the cause, diagnostic criteria and treatment of it -- especially since it has been identified in adults.</p>
        <p>In the minds of those who receive the diagnosis, some experts say, jumping on the attention deficit disorder bandwagon may be better than getting run over by it.</p>
        <p>''They're so grateful for the diagnosis, as opposed to the uncertainty they've lived with, that they embrace it,'' said Dr. Michael Gordon,  a clinical psychologist and professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York's Upstate Medical University. Dr. Gordon is a co-author of ''The Down and Dirty Guide to Adult A.D.D.''</p>
        <p>In the last 10 years, a number of studies have shown that 50 percent to 80 percent of children with the disorder continue to exhibit the criteria -- inattentiveness, failure to complete tasks, fidgeting, disorganization, forgetfulness and other signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness -- into adulthood. From 2 percent to 5 percent of children are now believed to have the disorder.</p>
        <p>''There is remarkably little scientific information about the adult variant of A.D.D.,'' Dr. Gordon said.</p>
        <p>''Diagnosing and treating A.D.D. is an art form, not a science,'' said Dr. Morris Stambler, a senior scholar at Harvard Medical School, who was the psychiatrist who diagnosed Mr. Zane's condition.</p>
        <p>The disorder symptoms for adults first appeared in 1980 in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which insurance companies use to guide coverage. Since then, the diagnostic criteria have continued to shift.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gordon offers one explanation linking advantages to the disorder. ''Many adults in times of stress -- when they're going through a divorce or under pressure at work or during exams -- go from 'I'm inattentive' to 'I must have A.D.D.,' '' he said. ''And now, for various reasons, what's happening is clinicians, patients and advocacy groups are becoming rather enthusiastic about extending the criteria so that the diagnosis of A.D.D. may include them.''</p>
        <p>Those ''various reasons,'' Dr. Gordon added, include the ease with which attention deficit can be made a scapegoat for ''high functioning people who bemoan the fact that they're not functioning at an even higher level.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, he suggested that people with legitimate symptoms be tested.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the rush persists to label anyone who chronically forgets where he left his keys as an attention-deficit-disorder-inspired absent-minded genius.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gordon recalled a send-up of the overdiagnosis of the disorder in a recent episode of ''South Park,'' the irreverent animated television show. In the episode, a school psychologist tests for the disorder by reading ''The Great Gatsby'' and ''A Farewell to Arms'' out loud and then quizzing students. Every student fails the quiz, is given a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and is put on Ritalin -- which was what the characters wanted in the first place.</p>
