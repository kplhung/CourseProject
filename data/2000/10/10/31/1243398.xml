        <p>Editorial says final week of any hard-fought campaign brings out best and worst in candidates and their campaign strategists and advertising experts; says that in presidential race between Vice Pres Al Gore and Gov George W Bush, there have been some unfortunate excesses; says while there is nothing inherently wrong with sharp exchanges and rhetorical attacks about character and stands on issues in a campaign, both sides are pushing the outside of the acceptability envelope; says in New York Senate race, attacks by Rep Rick Lazio on Hillary Rodham Clinton have air of desperation and perhaps panic about them; says Lazio's charge that Clinton cavorted with terrorists is both absurd and extreme; questions his assertion that he had nothing to do with telephone campaign conducted by New York Republican Party that sounded to callers like opinion poll; says there is no excuse for waging irresponsible smear attacks and then pretending that he is only an observer in their dissemination</p>

        <p>The final week of any hard-fought campaign brings out the best and worst in candidates and their campaign strategists and advertising experts. The presidential contenders are in full cry and have gotten down to the basics of their pitches to the voters, with Vice President Al Gore portraying Gov. George W. Bush as lacking experience and Mr. Bush asserting that Mr. Gore lacks integrity. Much is being made of their negative tone and the ever tougher messages delivered by telephone. But our view is that while there have been some unfortunate excesses, there is also nothing inherently wrong with sharp exchanges and rhetorical attacks about character and stands on issues in a campaign. Indeed they are a vital part of the process and a standard feature of the last week of most campaigns.</p>
        <p>But we hope that both sides in the presidential contest realize they are pushing the outside of the acceptability envelope. The attacks that have riled Republicans include a phone message for the Democrats, delivered by the actor Ed Asner, warning that Mr. Bush's Social Security scheme jeopardizes current benefits, which is certainly an exaggeration. Another Democratic telephone attack featuring a Texas woman who suggests that her husband's death resulted in part from Mr. Bush's failure to improve nursing homes was hyperbolic and in bad taste. The Gore campaign, meanwhile, is furious that the governor's team is running an ad featuring Ralph Nader's attacks on the vice president's environmental record, which looks to us like fair game. An independent pro-Bush group's ad, showing a girl plucking a daisy like the girl in a notorious 1964 ad against Barry Goldwater, and asserting that the Clinton administration had given away nuclear secrets, is an unjustified smear and the Bush campaign was right to ask for its withdrawal.</p>

        <p>But we hope that both sides in the presidential contest realize they are pushing the outside of the acceptability envelope. The attacks that have riled Republicans include a phone message for the Democrats, delivered by the actor Ed Asner, warning that Mr. Bush's Social Security scheme jeopardizes current benefits, which is certainly an exaggeration. Another Democratic telephone attack featuring a Texas woman who suggests that her husband's death resulted in part from Mr. Bush's failure to improve nursing homes was hyperbolic and in bad taste. The Gore campaign, meanwhile, is furious that the governor's team is running an ad featuring Ralph Nader's attacks on the vice president's environmental record, which looks to us like fair game. An independent pro-Bush group's ad, showing a girl plucking a daisy like the girl in a notorious 1964 ad against Barry Goldwater, and asserting that the Clinton administration had given away nuclear secrets, is an unjustified smear and the Bush campaign was right to ask for its withdrawal.</p>
        <p>The exchanges over the last few days in the New York Senate race strike us as more questionable than those in the presidential contest. The attacks by Representative Rick Lazio on Hillary Rodham Clinton have an air of desperation and perhaps panic about them. When The Daily News attributed anti-Israel remarks to members of at least two Muslim groups who had met with the first lady and in some cases written her campaign checks, Mrs. Clinton returned the money. Mr. Lazio, in turn, accused Mrs. Clinton of condoning terrorism by accepting the checks in the first place and undercutting Israel by her earlier expression of support for a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>Israel is always going to be a sensitive and hotly debated issue in any New York contest. But Mr. Lazio's attacks have been absurd and extreme. In the debate last Friday, he charged that Mrs. Clinton had cavorted with terrorists. Then came an intemperate telephone campaign conducted by the New York Republican Party that sounded to some callers like an opinion poll. It is unethical for any campaign to mislead recipients this way. Mr. Lazio's assertion that he had nothing to do with it and should not be held responsible was not convincing. The ad is gone, but the congressman should know better than to try to be cute about rejecting responsibility for the misleading tactics from his own party organization.</p>
        <p>A rule of thumb in attack politics is that the advertising sponsors should always be identified and the candidates must be accountable for the actions of their official supporters. Mr. Lazio has run a tough race that has suffered in part because of a late start after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out. He has done an effective job in outlining his differences with Mrs. Clinton and asserting that as an outsider she is not qualified to serve as New York's senator. Unfortunately for him, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows that New Yorkers are more, not less, inclined to accept an outsider as senator. Not making headway on that issue is no excuse to wage irresponsible smear attacks and then pretend that he is only an observer in their dissemination.</p>
