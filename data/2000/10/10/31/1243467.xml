        <p>NEITHER snow (blizzards of confetti), nor heat (a sanitation truck caught fire), nor chill (mid-40's with a stinging wind), nor inconveniences (a paucity of portable toilets), nor school (thousands of truants roamed lower Broadway after the mayor virtually sanctioned the unlocking of classrooms) nor yet another victory parade for the New York Yankees could stay these throngs of fans from the sweet contemplation of their appointed heroes.</p>
        <p>One might imagine that these wild and crazy fans would get bored with the whole thing -- this fourth World Series championship parade in five years.

        <p>NEITHER snow (blizzards of confetti), nor heat (a sanitation truck caught fire), nor chill (mid-40's with a stinging wind), nor inconveniences (a paucity of portable toilets), nor school (thousands of truants roamed lower Broadway after the mayor virtually sanctioned the unlocking of classrooms) nor yet another victory parade for the New York Yankees could stay these throngs of fans from the sweet contemplation of their appointed heroes.</p>
        <p>One might imagine that these wild and crazy fans would get bored with the whole thing -- this fourth World Series championship parade in five years. You might think they'd be smarter (we're told often enough, after all, that this is the mecca of the streetwise, the hipster, the coolest cats) than wallowing in crowds, flinging ever more paper, jumping up and down at the sight a bunch of young men dressed in what was primarily the mode of the day: leather jackets, jeans, sunglasses (most of them, though, generally recognizable away from the ballpark even without, as Michelle Wernert-Piper, a Frenchwoman recent to these shores, observed, ''those funny costumes'').</p>
        <p>But no, these wild and crazy fans do not get bored with it all, because they are wild and crazy. Such comportment is given full rein in the Fans' Bill of Rights. And so after the floats had taken the players and the manager and the owner and all the rest of the Yankee entourage to the steps of City Hall, the fans, amid blue and white balloons and big banners and bunting festooning the building, were shaking pompoms and screaming at the top of their lungs.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, wearing a Yankee cap, to be sure, handed out keys to the city to the Yankees. He is an ardent fan, and applauded when one of the Yankee announcers, Michael Kay, introduced this team as ''maybe the best team in baseball history,'' given that they've won three straight World Series and had to do it in the rugged playoff system that didn't begin until some 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>This Yankee team has at least three potential Hall of Famers: Derek Jeter, Roger Clemens and Mariano Rivera. A perennial All-Star in Bernie Williams. And a passel of excellent veteran players -- from Tino to O'Neill to Pettitte -- who know how to win. They beat everybody they had to beat. But might other teams, and other Yankee teams -- the DiMaggio, Raschi, Reynolds and Yogi Berra teams of the 40's and 50's, which won five World Series in a row, for one; the Mantle, Maris, Ford and Yogi Berra teams of the early 60's, for another -- have been better?</p>
        <p>When the point about the 2000 Yankees was raised by Kay yesterday, Berra, seated on the podium in a gray topcoat, smiled, but only politely. The man of many words -- not all of them always in syntactical order -- didn't have to say anything else.</p>
        <p>But New Yorkers can take ample pride in this team of people from regions as far-flung as Texas and Michigan and Ohio and Puerto Rico and Panama and Brooklyn. The spirit was a generous one at the ceremony, with Giuliani praising the Mets, who had been defeated in the Subway Series, and asking Yankee fans for a cheer for the Mets. The fans indeed responded with one (but only one).</p>
        <p>Several players spoke, like Jeter expressing appreciation to the fans and admiration for his teammates. David Cone, who may be at the end of his Yankee career after a difficult season, said how glad he was to be there, and added poignantly, ''I may never get this chance again.''</p>
        <p>Then Jorge Posada, the catcher, and Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez, the gritty Cuban pitcher, were called to the microphone. El Duque, who is known to speak only Spanish, took the microphone. He whispered something to Posada, who nodded. ''He wants to talk to you in English,'' Posada told the crowd. El Duque cleared his throat. ''I feel very well,'' he said before twice saying thank you. El Duque smiled shyly. Everyone broke up. The fans cheered.</p>
        <p>''He should take that on Broadway,'' said George Steinbrenner, the Yankee principal owner. The event ended with balloons released into the cool blue sky, and the organist striking up ''New York, New York.''</p>
        <p>''Wait till next year,'' someone in the crowd said. Was he talking about a fourth straight Yankee world championship? Not likely. He was wearing, of all things, a Mets cap.</p>
