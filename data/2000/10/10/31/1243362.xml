        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''There'll Be a Quiz on This Tomorrow'' (Week in Review, Oct. 29): In some circles, lots of homework may be the sign of a ''good'' school. But what is really important about homework is quality. Homework has value when used to reinforce what happens in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Assigning students to memorize a reasonable number of spelling words or foreign language vocabulary, or to read a chapter in a history book or a literary work to be discussed, makes sense because it can enhance a classroom session. Having students complete a dozen math problems or write a paper allows them to demonstrate mastery and creativity.</p>
        <p>But asking students to learn new material transfers work that should be done by the teacher to the student or the parent. And forcing them to copy lengthy passages, write reports that are judged on the basis of length,  or complete dozens of repetitive arithmetic problems wastes their time.</p>
