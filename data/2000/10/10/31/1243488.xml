        <p>President Clinton late tonight vetoed an $18.1 billion spending bill that finances the operations of the Treasury Department, the White House and Congress, setting up a confrontation that could very well lead to lawmakers' having to return after the election to complete work on a federal budget.</p>
        <p>''The Congress's continued refusal to focus on the priorities of the American people leaves me no alternative but to veto this bill,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement released around midnight, the deadline for deciding whether to veto the measure or allow it to become law without his signature.</p>

        <p>President Clinton late tonight vetoed an $18.1 billion spending bill that finances the operations of the Treasury Department, the White House and Congress, setting up a confrontation that could very well lead to lawmakers' having to return after the election to complete work on a federal budget.</p>
        <p>''The Congress's continued refusal to focus on the priorities of the American people leaves me no alternative but to veto this bill,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement released around midnight, the deadline for deciding whether to veto the measure or allow it to become law without his signature.</p>
        <p>''I cannot in good conscience sign a bill that funds the operations of the Congress and the White House before funding our classrooms, fixing our schools and protecting our workers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton listed no objections to the spending measure and had strongly suggested recently that he would sign it. Thus, his veto will be seen by many as retaliation for what the White House considered a reneging by House leaders on another spending bill that had been worked out Sunday night.</p>
        <p>The Treasury and legislative branch bill that was vetoed tonight contained a repeal of the federal telephone excise tax -- a measure dear to the Republicans' hearts. It also contained the budget for the White House and Congress, financed the Treasury Department and cleared the way for an automatic cost-of-living pay raise for the lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Earlier tonight, Mr. Clinton signed a $310 billion defense bill that provides an array of upgrades for military personnel but lacks the hate crimes provisions he had hoped to enact. The bill included a 3.7 percent raise for military personnel and a subsistence payment of up to $500 per month for the more than 5,100 military families who receive food stamps. The legislation also expands the military health care plan to provide lifetime benefits for career retirees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's veto tonight of the operations bill is bound to further poison the atmosphere between the White House and Congress. Before the president vetoed the measure, several lawmakers said that if he did so it would be doubtful that any significant legislation would be passed before the election.</p>
        <p>''If he does that, this legislative session may be over,'' said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip.</p>
        <p>The bill on which Sunday night's  agreement fell through, a $113 billion measure to finance the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human Services, had been hammered out in late night talks between White House officials and the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate Appropriation Committees.</p>
        <p>The tentative agreement fell apart less than 12 hours after it was reached, as Republican leaders balked at a provision aimed at protecting workers from injuries associated with repetitive motion activities. The compromise would have delayed enforcement of the regulations until June 1, 2001, when a new president would be in office.</p>
        <p>''The ergonomics language is problematic,'' John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said, using the short hand for the new workplace rules.</p>
        <p>The rejection of the deal by Republican leaders, only hours after the language had been hammered out by their own negotiators, left a sour taste with the White House.</p>
        <p>''What we see makes it very hard for us to know with whom to negotiate,'' said Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget.  The failure of that agreement and the president's veto tonight mean that Congress will remain in session at least through the end of this week and greatly increase the likelihood that lawmakers will be called back in a lame duck session to complete work on the budget after the election.</p>
        <p>With seven days to go before the election, Congress and the White House have yet to agree on a proposal to grant amnesty to thousands of immigrants living in the country illegally, an increase in the minimum wage, any significant tax cuts and a $31 billion Medicare payment to hospitals, nursing homes and health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>While those items are optional, Congress and the White House have also not reached an accord on a number of spending bills that are needed to keep major portions of the federal government functioning.</p>
        <p>''To put it in football parlance, the clock is running out,'' said Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt.</p>
        <p>With the agreement on the labor and education bill now in tatters and the veto of a bill Republican lawmakers thought was a closed deal, bills financing such agencies as the National Institutes of Health, the Social Security Administration have still not made it into law.</p>
        <p>The authority for many federal agencies to spend money expired with the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. These agencies remain operating only because Congress has been passing stopgap spending bills -- some spanning a week, the latest lasting 24 hours. The House approved another such measure today -- the 10th since the start of the fiscal year -- by a vote of 336 to 9. The Senate followed suit by a vote of 70 to 1.</p>
        <p>Even as deals fall through, there remains a sense of confidence among the Republicans and resignation among the Democrats that the public is paying little heed to what Congress is doing and is not in a mood to punish Republican lawmakers -- as they did in the past -- for failing to agree on spending measures needed to keep the government functioning.</p>
        <p>''You've had the presidential election, the Olympics and the World Series grabbing the public's attention,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland. ''No one is paying any attention to what is going on around here.''</p>
        <p>House Republicans leaders say they are standing their ground against many White House spending proposals, in part because they are loath to repeat what they see as the error of 1998, when House Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed with the White House on a comprehensive spending package that many conservatives felt was far too expensive. Those conservatives, some Republican strategists say, later punished the party at the polls.</p>
        <p>''People think we lost seats because of impeachment,'' Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip. ''Impeachment had nothing to do with us losing seats. The major thing was an omnibus bill that had disgustingly high increases in spending. Our base was disgusted by that, and in all the seats we lost, 10 to 15 per cent of the conservative base stayed home.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason for what they see as Republican intransigence, Democrats today voiced frustration at having reached an agreement on a $113 billion measure and then seeing the product of their work scuttled less than 12 hours later.</p>
        <p>''If a deal doesn't last for 12 hours,'' said Mr. Lew of the Office of Management and Budget, ''it's hard to see how you can have any deals at all.''</p>
