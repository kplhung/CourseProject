        <p>Does naughty fashion need a spanking? That was the impression some people took away from the recent round of international collections for spring 2001, which concluded earlier this month. In the aftermath of runway shows in New York, London, Paris and Milan, much ink was spilled about a designer revival of punk, of ratty styles from the benighted 1980's, of ''Flashdance'' clothes and ruching -- as though, weary of imitating Upper East Side ladies, women were hankering for an opportunity to dress up as Jennifer Beals in a set of cafe curtains.</p>
        <p>But behind all the foofaraw were darker and not unfamiliar strains of influence, specifically in clothes that made frank allusion to bondage, fetishes and sadomasochism. This was by no means fashion's first excursion into the territory. Remember Gianni Versace's bondage collection of the early 1990's? The corsets and cone bras Jean Paul Gaultier designed for Madonna's ''Blond Ambition'' tour? The fashion photographer Helmut Newton's protracted romance with the louche iconography of the alleys?

        <p>Does naughty fashion need a spanking? That was the impression some people took away from the recent round of international collections for spring 2001, which concluded earlier this month. In the aftermath of runway shows in New York, London, Paris and Milan, much ink was spilled about a designer revival of punk, of ratty styles from the benighted 1980's, of ''Flashdance'' clothes and ruching -- as though, weary of imitating Upper East Side ladies, women were hankering for an opportunity to dress up as Jennifer Beals in a set of cafe curtains.</p>
        <p>But behind all the foofaraw were darker and not unfamiliar strains of influence, specifically in clothes that made frank allusion to bondage, fetishes and sadomasochism. This was by no means fashion's first excursion into the territory. Remember Gianni Versace's bondage collection of the early 1990's? The corsets and cone bras Jean Paul Gaultier designed for Madonna's ''Blond Ambition'' tour? The fashion photographer Helmut Newton's protracted romance with the louche iconography of the alleys? What made this season's kinky excursion different was the diffuse way fetish wear turned up on the runways, in collections from designers of all stripes.</p>
        <p>At Dolce &amp; Gabbana's show in Milan, for instance, there were skirts held together with wide lacing up the side seams and also, suggestively, up the front and back. At Gucci in Milan, Tom Ford sent models out wearing flasher raincoats and also in bone-like corsets that outlined cupped breasts covered in weird conical bras. At Fendi, designed by Karl Lagerfeld, models sauntered down the catwalk holding gold chain leashes attached to their spike-heeled shoes.</p>
        <p>At Lawrence Steele's Milan show, there were patent leather jackets that wouldn't have looked out of place on the bondage pinup Betty Page. At both Dior and Jean Paul Gaultier's shows in Paris, there were trousers with just one leg, the other (and the buttock) left bare. John Galliano exhibited outfits slashed with outsize biker zippers, and dresses that looked like French maid outfits assembled by a demented home sewer. John Bartlett's New York show featured clothes ornamented with coiled rope, a reference, the designer later remarked, to his interest in the ''sensuality of rope,'' discovered on a recent trip to Japan, and also in the ritual practice of sadomasochism.</p>
        <p>''We're coming out of a period of ladylike, bourgeois Stepford wife clothes,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''There is a reaction to that.'' In putting together his spring collection, Mr. Bartlett explained, he had a desire to be ''a little more primitive.'' His collection was about the tension between ''restraint and the way desire manages to find sensual expression,'' he said. ''I was working from the idea that kink and role-playing can be so expressive of sexuality, and sensuality.''</p>
        <p>For the final look in his debut collection for the house of Yves Saint Laurent, Tom Ford expressed sensuality with a sculptured bodice reminiscent, critics pointed out, of an outfit Saint Laurent himself had shown long ago. But this corsetlike garment, unlike Mr. Saint Laurent's, was anatomically accurate down to the nipples, one of which was pierced. Similarly, Helmut Lang's New York presentation was filled with clothes whose straps and closures evoked other designers (Azzedine Alaia) and the sort of get-ups you'd see at XXX specialty stores.</p>
        <p>There were corsets everywhere at the spring shows, and hobble skirts and abbreviated backless cowboy chaps. Even Miuccia Prada's otherwise chaste collection contained elements oddly suggestive of perverse role-play: dirndl skirts and black nylon executive ankle socks that conveyed an attitude so severe that Women's Wear Daily characterized the look as ''prison matron goes to the hop.'' The line between mainstream and taboo practices apparently isn't so sharp anymore. ''The boundaries that all cultures fix and that we then work so hard to keep in place'' are now permeable, said Ellen Handler Spitz, a lecturer in art history at Stanford University, who has written often about fetishism. ''In this fin de siecle period,' she added, ''there seems to be a fascination with this sort of thing, perhaps spilling over into fashion. Perverse meanings are being drained a bit and just the fanciful, experimental, wildly imaginative aspects predominate.''</p>
        <p>At the most basic level, a critical function of fashion is to stimulate desire. What, then, does it say about cultural appetites when an entire fashion season is informed by the symbols of taboo acts? Are leashes and corsets symbolic correctives, not only to ladylike dressing, but to the equally retro ladylike mores? And are references to bondage, sadomasochism and erotic role-play an effort to connote the frustrations of naked contact in the age of AIDS?</p>
        <p>Asked if those factors had gone into producing a collection that, by critical consensus, bore close resemblance to bondage clothes, Helmut Lang replied with an emphatic no. ''It was not from some S/M thing,'' Mr. Lang said. ''I didn't feel anything for that.'' Rather, he said, the clothes were a rejection of last season's trend, ''which was very much about ladylike fashion and uptown socialites, et cetera, and trying to put young girls in the clothes and attitudes of their mothers and grandmothers.'' Ladylike dressing ''was such a mental setback,'' Mr. Lang said. ''I think the look is to be forward and modern and do clothes for the society of our time.''</p>
        <p>That society, said Valerie Steele, chief curator and acting director of the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology, has become one in which ladylike dressing is best understood as a reaction to feminism, one where an Emma Peel version of the empowered woman is just one of many available icons. The appeal of corseted women in thigh boots and molded body armor is enduring, said Ms. Steele, who is also the author of ''Fetish: Fashion, Sex and Power'' (Oxford University Press, 1996).</p>
        <p>''A lot of these styles which people found erotically stimulating, but kept secret, began to come out of the closet and onto the streets and catwalks from the late 1960's on,'' Ms. Steele said. ''They're always there.'' Fetishism in fashion ''comes back and forth in a pendulum effect,'' she added -- ''there in '92 and gone in '93, as if the designers suddenly say, 'Oh, we're all finished with that S/M look.' '' Sometimes it returns with an ironic nod; sometimes as a knowing insider's reference; sometimes, it would seem, as a phantom expression of cultural anxiety.</p>
        <p>''Women's liberation was instrumental in making possible this image of a powerful, eroticized woman,'' said Ms. Steele, although most feminists would resist the suggestion that the way to crash the glass ceiling is by wearing a corset to work. AIDS, too, had an impact on the forms that designers employ to conjure images of seduction.  ''AIDS acted to reinforce these other reasons for having fetish fashions come out of the closet,'' Ms. Steele said. Read as body armor, fetish clothes symbolize safe sex.</p>
        <p>The Gucci raincoat, for instance, oversize, belted and butch, is the kind of wardrobe staple no self-respecting dominatrix (is there any other kind?) would be without. It is also, Ms. Steele suggested, symbolically ''a body glove,'' a garment suggestive of ''sex without exposure, perverse dramatic scenarios,'' rather than an exchange of bodily fluids with all the potential danger that entails.</p>
        <p>''S/M has always been treated like it's seedy, dirty and nasty,'' said Merrill Seldes, proprietor of the Noose, a 19-year-old fetish wear store in Chelsea. Now, ''it's perfectly fine and playful,'' Ms. Seldes added. ''There's nothing scary about it anymore.''</p>
        <p>What designers might have been up to in the last cycle, suggested David Samuel Menkes, a local craftsman who specializes in extravagantly severe custom bondage gear, ''was showing the emergence of S/M from the shadows.'' At this particular instant in cultural history, Mr. Menkes said, ''there's nothing to be shocked at anymore. It's as if a designer said, 'This is the day dress, this is the cotton chiffon, this is the S/M.' It's just another tool.''</p>
