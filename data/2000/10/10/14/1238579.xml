        <p>In the first half of this year, the Conservative Leadership Political Action Committee collected $5,000 -- a single contribution from a Florida retiree. Then the group hitched its fate to New York's Senate race, billing itself as the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton, and it says that from July through September, it raised $1.9 million.</p>
        <p>An impressive sum, and more evidence of the fervor of people who dislike Mrs. Clinton. But it turns out that after expenses, there is not a great deal of money left for the Senate race. A spokesman for the group, Mark Montini, said yesterday that it had only $370,000 in the bank.</p>
        <p>Direct-mail fund-raising is very expensive, and Mr. Montini said much of the group's expenditures went toward printing and postage. He pointed out that besides seeking donations, the solicitations made the group's case against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>One letter declares that Mrs. Clinton ''is an angry woman who is abusive to White House staff and obsessed with imposing her radical-left vision on the rest of America.'' But Mr. Montini acknowledged that many of the solicitations did not go to New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>The group had promised to raise $9 million to beat Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Montini said it would not meet its goal. He said he hoped to collect $2 million more before the election. ''We are very happy with what we have been able to do so far,'' Mr. Montini said.</p>
        <p>While the fund-raising drive against Mrs. Clinton may not have much of an effect on the campaign, it has certainly helped to increase the group's list of potential donors.</p>
        <p>The group, which is supported by prominent conservatives like Edwin Meese III, the attorney general in the Reagan administration, has attracted attention in recent weeks because it has vowed to spurn an agreement between Mrs. Clinton and her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, limiting spending in the contest.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, commercial time on television and radio is supposed to be bought only by the two campaigns, not the Republican and Democratic Parties or outside advocacy groups like the Conservative Leadership PAC. Mr. Montini said that if the group had enough money, it would buy commercials in the final days of the race.</p>
        <p>If that happens, Mrs. Clinton could consider the agreement broken and ask her allies to spend money on commercials. But given that the group does not seem to have much money now, it might be difficult for her to justify a major retaliation.</p>
        <p>The New York Republican State Committee has also sought to use Mrs. Clinton as a fund-raising vehicle. Its spokesman, Dan Allen, said it had collected $1.5 million in the third quarter for its federal political committee, and had about $700,000 on hand after expenses.</p>
