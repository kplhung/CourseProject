        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial that Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for Senate began broadcasting last night.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Team Hillary</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with white type on a black screen, declaring: ''In the end, it's about the issues.'' It shows Mrs. Clinton in a series of sunny scenes -- with elderly New Yorkers, in a classroom -- intended to amplify the sharper remarks being made by a narrator contrasting her views with those of her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''In the end, it's about the issues. Hillary supports guaranteed prescription drug coverage for all seniors. Lazio voted no with the drug companies. Hillary supports adding 100,000 new teachers. Lazio has voted no -- voted with Gingrich for the biggest education cuts in history. Hillary says use the surplus to extend Social Security. Lazio, like George Bush -- a trillion-dollar tax plan. His plans squander the surplus. Hillary's the one who'll be a strong voice for us.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio both support expanding Medicare to cover some prescription drug costs for the elderly, but Mr. Lazio supports a more limited federal program. Mr. Lazio's aides say Mrs. Clinton has also proposed large cuts in education spending. Mr. Lazio asserts that his tax cut plan would cost less than the one proposed by Mr. Bush, and that there is enough money in the federal surplus to ensure the stability of Social Security.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The central theme of this ad -- ''in the end, it's about the issues'' -- represents a fairly concise summary of what Mrs. Clinton's aides would like this race to be about; Mr. Lazio would prefer that it be about Mrs. Clinton. With the words of the announcer and the scenes on the screen, she has reprised issues on which polling suggests she has a stronger position than her opponent: education, Social Security and prescription drug coverage for the elderly. To make her point, she has once again pointed to votes Mr. Lazio has cast in Congress.</p>
