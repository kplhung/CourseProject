        <p>For more than a year, Richard Li floated in the gossamer winds of cyberspace. A few weeks ago, gravity began exerting its pull. Today, Mr. Li landed with a hard thud.</p>
        <p>His company, Pacific Century CyberWorks, announced it had accepted reduced terms in its joint venture with Australia's state telephone company, Telstra, to reflect a more than 60 percent decline in Pacific Century's share price.</p>
        <p>Telstra will still inject $2.4 billion into Pacific Century. But now Telstra will take majority control of the cellular operations that Pacific Century acquired in its $38 billion takeover of Hong Kong's telephone company.</p>
        <p>Telstra also extracted better terms for its direct investment in Pacific Century. It is injecting $750 million rather than $1.5 billion. And its investment is in the form of a six-year bond that converts into Pacific Century shares at a more favorable price than the first deal, which was announced in April.</p>
        <p>''Every aspect of this deal has improved for us, and not in a small way,'' said Steve Wright, a spokesman for Telstra.</p>
        <p>Pacific Century, an Internet start-up that briefly reigned as one of the most highly valued companies in Hong Kong, tried to put a good face on what was essentially a financial salvage operation.</p>
        <p>''We managed to hold the deal together while others broke,'' said Alexander Arena, the deputy chairman of the executive committee. ''We were able to keep all the elements in place, every piece of the package.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arena said that ceding control of the cellular business was a benefit because it would free Pacific Century to focus on higher-growth businesses like its broadband programming service, Network of the World. Telstra originally agreed to pay $1.5 billion for 40 percent of the cellular assets.</p>
        <p>But it was clearly not a banner day in the short, frenetic history of Pacific Century CyberWorks. The energetic Mr. Li, who is a fixture at news conferences announcing joint ventures and investments, was nowhere to be seen. A company spokeswoman said he was busy on other matters.</p>
        <p>Pacific Century's woes have been scrutinized because the two-year-old company has come to symbolize the fervid dreams and sudden disappointments of the Internet in Asia. With its 33-year-old founder, Mr. Li, and its vaulting ambitions, Pacific Century seemed like a triumph of hope over experience.</p>
        <p>But the company was humbled by the global sell-off of technology stocks. Its share price tumbled from a high of 26 Hong Kong dollars, or $3.35, just before it undertook a takeover of Cable and Wireless HKT in February, to a low of 7.60 Hong Kong dollars, or 98 cents, on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot more realism in the price now,'' said David Webb, the editor of Webb-site.com, an Internet site that has been skeptical of the company.</p>
        <p>Trading in Pacific Century's shares was suspended today; some analysts predicted that the stock would rebound next week now that the Telstra deal has been saved. Even critics like Mr. Webb said Pacific Century could set about melding its operations with those of Cable and Wireless HKT.</p>
        <p>Pacific Century said that even in its amended form, the Telstra alliance would reduce its debt to $5.5 billion from $9 billion. Not all of that money will come from Telstra. The partners plan to set up a wholesale carrier of telephone traffic. After the venture raises $2 billion in debt financing, it will pay $1.125 billion back to Pacific Century and $375 million to Telstra.</p>
        <p>This venture, which may later be taken public, will be the third-largest carrier of voice traffic in the world. But analysts said it would face stiff competition from other carriers like Level 3 and Asia Global Crossing.</p>
        <p>''Global Crossing has brand-new fiber assets, while HKT and Telstra have older undersea cable,'' said Greg Feldberg, the head of Internet and telecommunications research at Indosuez W. I. Carr Securities here. ''On the other hand, HKT and Telstra have lots of customers.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest wild card in Pacific Century's future is its programming service, Network of the World. At the moment, it consists of four hours a day of original programming on a single television channel, beamed by satellite to Asia and the Middle East. The companion Web site (www.now.com) has five portals that contain information that builds on the programming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Li envisions NOW as a global service that will provide a new entertainment experience to an Internet-oriented generation. The trouble is, Pacific Century has little programming of its own, and has yet to strike an alliance with a big entertainment company like Walt Disney or Time Warner.</p>
        <p>NOW offers a baffling array of features, ranging from live video of whales in South Africa to a portal where viewers submit their own music videos. NOW's acronym, some skeptics say, should stand for ''No one watching.''</p>
        <p>''Everyone is going off what they see on the Web site,'' said Mr. Feldberg, who recommends Pacific Century's stock. ''It's not enough to generate enthusiasm. But we haven't seen their interactive stuff yet.''</p>
