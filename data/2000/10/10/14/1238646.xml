        <p>The Chevron Corporation, the nation's third-largest oil company, is close to an agreement to acquire Texaco Inc. for about $36 billion in stock plus the assumption of debt, according to executives close to the negotiations.</p>
        <p>Both boards are planning to meet over the weekend and an announcement of the deal, which would create the fourth-largest oil concern in the world, could be made as early as Monday, the executives said.</p>
        <p>The deal would be the latest in a series of mergers that have created ''supermajor'' oil companies like Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco. Consolidation in the industry has put enormous pressure on smaller oil companies to merge or risk falling behind in  earnings and in developing new oil and gas fields.</p>
        <p>The deal would combine the former Standard Oil Company of California, now known as Chevron, based in San Francisco, with Texaco, based in White Plains.</p>
        <p>''What they are attempting to do is what BP Amoco and Arco realized and that is to do more at a lower cost and to gain efficiencies,'' said Philip Verleger Jr., a principal at the Brattle Group in Boston. ''There is a lot of duplication that can be eliminated. Of all the mergers that have taken place in the industry so far this has the chance of achieving the most huge gains.''</p>
        <p>The agreement would come more than a year after Texaco's board rejected a formal proposal from Chevron to acquire it for about $37.5 billion, citing unacceptable ''complexity, feasibility, risk and price'' as the reasons for abandoning the deal. The real stumbling block to that deal has been removed: Chevron's then-chairman and  chief executive, Kenneth T. Derr, retired. He had demanded that a Chevron executive head the new company, according to people involved in the talks then.</p>
        <p>It is unclear who would head the new company if the deal was consummated.</p>
        <p>''The only reason that the deal didn't go through was that the old C.E.O. was against this,'' one investment banker said. ''He saw how hard it was to extract synergies'' in Chevron's acquisition of the Gulf Corporation for $13.2 billion in 1984.</p>
        <p>''Now that they have a new C.E.O.,'' the banker added, ''maybe as the new dog on the block, he thinks he can pull it off.''</p>
        <p>The executives warned that as with all deals, the talks could still collapse at the last minute. Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission, which long resisted BP Amoco's acquisition of Atlantic Richfield, would have to approve the creation of yet another market behemoth. The executives said they were still discussing regulatory issues related to their refining and retail operations.</p>
        <p>According to the executives, Chevron has offered about 0.77 of a share -- or $64.87 -- for every share of Texaco, making the total purchase price worth $35.8 billion based on Chevron's closing price yesterday and Texaco's 551.25 million outstanding shares. Shares of Chevron closed down $3.06, to $84.25, yesterday, while shares of Texaco dropped $1.88, to $55.13.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the two companies declined to comment.</p>
        <p>If the merger goes forward, the new company would have total revenue of $66.5 billion, based on 1999 figures, and would employ close to 55,000 people before any layoffs that might result from the deal.</p>
        <p>Experts were divided about whether the merger would make sense. ''I can't imagine Chevron doing this because it would drag down their growth,'' an investment banker said. ''They are giving shareholders returns only second to Exxon. Texaco doesn't have the growth that Chevron has, so it would be dilutive for Chevron to do this.''</p>
        <p>In the wake of the mergers over the last two years that have created far larger competitors in the oil industry, Chevron has maintained that it could make its own, quite profitable way despite its size. After posting rather mediocre returns last year, Chevron has won respect from analysts this year because of its oil and gas exploration projects in the deep waters of West Africa, the Caspian Sea and off the coast of Brazil.</p>
        <p>''Our belief is that Chevron's access to low-cost international oil projects in West Africa and Kazakhstan provides it with the ability to add profitable future reserves,'' Merrill Lynch noted in a recent report on the company.</p>
        <p>Texaco is also active in deep-water operations in West Africa and Brazil, although its shares have not performed as well as those of the other major oil companies. Analysts say that should the merger occur, it would give the new company the deep pockets needed to develop complex offshore fields.</p>
        <p>''The deep water in the Gulf of Mexico, the West Coast of Africa, Kazakhstan, they're very deep and they require very large capital expenditures for rigs, pipelines, infrastructure,'' Mr. Verleger said. ''The cost of maintaining a very large exploration program and exploration portfolio has become so great that a firm has to have market capitalization north of $80 billion to $100 billion to do it. Texaco is too small to stay in the game.''</p>
        <p>Because of the overlap in their projects, industry experts expect significant job cuts and streamlining. This year, Exxon Mobil said it had billions of dollars in savings thanks to its 1998 merger.</p>
        <p>One example of potential savings might be the future of Caltex, Texaco and Chevron's joint venture that markets petroleum products in Asia. In the case of a merger, the venture, which, like any joint project, is expensive to operate, would be swallowed into the unified company.</p>
        <p>But the new company would have to pass muster with an F.T.C. that proved highly critical of the BP Amoco-Arco deal. To ease the process, Texaco might have to relinquish its stake in Equilon, a joint venture with the Shell Oil Company  involved in refining and marketing of petroleum products.</p>
