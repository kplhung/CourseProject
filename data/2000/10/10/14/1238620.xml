        <p>The remains of five United States Navy seamen, killed on Thursday during an explosion on the destroyer Cole in Yemen, arrived here aboard the first of several Air Force cargo planes that are evacuating the dead and wounded.</p>
        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said tonight that the death toll had risen to 17, though sailors aboard the Cole had yet to recover the bodies of 10 crew members missing after the blast.</p>
        <p>Two Air Force C-9A medical evacuation planes from Ramstein picked up survivors, one in Yemen and the other in Djibouti, where wounded sailors had received initial treatment at a French military hospital. The planes are expected here sometime before dawn Saturday.</p>
        <p>The bodies arrived here in one of the Air Force's giant C-17 cargo lifters, and were received by hastily arranged honor guards from both the Navy and the Air Force.</p>
        <p>The Navy had flown in its honor guard of more than 30 sailors, most from the Sixth Fleet's base in Naples, Italy.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have any idea that we were going to be pallbearers,'' said Mark Granito, a sailor who works as a chef for the Naples base. ''We mustered up these people in 30 minutes and got on a plane.''</p>
        <p>As several hundred soldiers watched silently in a chilly evening drizzle, the giant gray aircraft taxied slowly within a few dozen feet of the honor guards. Once parked, the aircraft opened at the tail section and its ramp unfolded to the ground.</p>
        <p>There were no speeches or funeral dirges.</p>
        <p>Pallbearers simply lined up outside the cargo bay and then carried each of the five flag-draped coffins to a separate waiting vehicle as the small crowd of Air Force spectators silently saluted. As the last vehicle was loaded, the setting sun poked through the rain clouds and bathed the western side of the base in an orange glow.</p>
        <p>An escort of German police cars then led the convoy on a short drive to the American military hospital at Landstuhl. The bodies are to remain at the hospital until Saturday morning, when they are to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.</p>
