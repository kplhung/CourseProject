        <p>Miller Theater continues to be a source of excellent things in terms of new music. On Tuesday evening Speculum Musicae, an ensemble happily on an upturn, offered much strong playing in some stark choices: primitivism raw (in Iannis Xenakis's ''Eonta'') or measured (in Varese's ''Ecuatorial''), sophistication of tone color (in Tristan Murail's ''Desintegrations'') or of line and harmony and subject matter (in Elliott Carter's ''Tempo e tempi'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Xenakis's slab of brute force, scored for piano with a quintet of trumpets and trombones, was given a keen performance by an electric Stephen Gosling at the piano with William Purvis conducting the brass, but the music stayed steadfastly unlovely.</p>

        <p>Miller Theater continues to be a source of excellent things in terms of new music. On Tuesday evening Speculum Musicae, an ensemble happily on an upturn, offered much strong playing in some stark choices: primitivism raw (in Iannis Xenakis's ''Eonta'') or measured (in Varese's ''Ecuatorial''), sophistication of tone color (in Tristan Murail's ''Desintegrations'') or of line and harmony and subject matter (in Elliott Carter's ''Tempo e tempi'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Xenakis's slab of brute force, scored for piano with a quintet of trumpets and trombones, was given a keen performance by an electric Stephen Gosling at the piano with William Purvis conducting the brass, but the music stayed steadfastly unlovely.</p>
        <p>There was a nice connection, though, with Mr. Murail's piece, which followed on the program. ''Eonta,'' at its rare beautiful moments, is about one instrument echoing the timbres of others: the brass musicians direct their force at the piano's strings, which respond with resonances uncannily resembling distant brass tones. In Mr. Murail's music the connections move much more quickly and fluidly and cover a wider field. They are also assisted by sounds on tape. At one remarkable point, the electronic sounds are curving quickly up into the upper treble, and they take some of the instruments with them, to disappear through a hole in the sky.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Milarsky conducted this piece with such authority that he seemed to be in control of the tape as well as the orchestra. Meanwhile, the instrumentalists formed and matched their sounds with lively sensitivity, and if there was a lack of urgency in the movement from one cloud to the next, that was in the nature of the piece.</p>
        <p>At the end of the concert, ''Ecuatorial'' offered more electronic sounds (from two ondes martenot), and more piano and brass, with organ and percussion -- modern and far-flung resources brilliantly used to suggest an ancient Central American ritual. Kevin Deas was an appealingly lyrical bass soloist; he deserved amplification. The orchestral performance, under Donald Palma, was a little tentative.</p>
        <p>Standing aside from the rest was Mr. Carter's recent bouquet of Italian songs, some elaborately wrought, some simple. In the title number, the different simultaneous streams of time in human experience are represented by oboe and clarinet setting off decisively in opposite directions, with violin soon looping above them.</p>
        <p>But ''Una Colomba'' is just a tiny preface to a single clarinet note, beautifully played here by Allen Blustine, and ''Uno'' is a frame for a cello solo, finely projected by Chris Finckel. Mostly, though, the voice is at the center of these supremely lyrical pieces, and Susan Narucki sang them with extraordinary care, freshness and immediacy.</p>
