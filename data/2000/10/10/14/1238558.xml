        <p>President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia could further restore the credibility of his country's courts by having them immediately take up the fate of Kosovo Albanians rounded up during the 1999 NATO bombing and now languishing in Serbian jails (news article, Oct. 11).

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia could further restore the credibility of his country's courts by having them immediately take up the fate of Kosovo Albanians rounded up during the 1999 NATO bombing and now languishing in Serbian jails (news article, Oct. 11). Most of the Kosovar prisoners -- whether they are still awaiting trial or have been  convicted -- have clearly been subject to procedural abuses that violate international treaties to which Yugoslavia is party.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the prisoners have been held long beyond the time allowable under international and Yugoslav law without any contact with judicial officers, lawyers or their families. In addition, no evidence was ever presented linking most of the individuals who were convicted to the crimes with which they were charged, and most of the convictions rested primarily or entirely on confessions extracted under pressure, including torture.</p>
