        <p>OM Gruppen, the parent of the Stockholm stock exchange, increased its bid for the London Stock Exchange by as much as 53 percent, to $:1.06 billion, or $1.54 billion, in an effort to woo shareholders who had dismissed its original offer as too low. Under the new terms, OM Gruppen is offering the holders a choice between an all-stock deal valued at $:35.83 a share and a mixture of stock and cash valued at $:32.79 a share. The London exchange, which has been resisting the takeover effort since it was announced Aug. 29, called the sweetened offer inadequate.</p>
