        <p>She was only 19, fresh out of basic training, just beginning to grasp what the United States Navy might be all about. It was Lakeina Monique Francis' first sail as a proud member of her country's armed services. She was assigned to the destroyer Cole. As the ship plowed through the ocean, she had no doubt that she was at sea.</p>
        <p>''We heard from her on Sunday,'' her mother, Sandra, said. ''She was just getting over seasickness.''</p>
        <p>Her family was uncertain where her ship was actually headed. She wasn't allowed to tell. They didn't hear the name Yemen until Thursday, when a Navy chaplain and a Navy officer arrived at their home in Woodleaf, a small North Carolina town, to give them the worst news possible.</p>
        <p>Seaman Francis, a mess management specialist, was among the 17 American sailors killed in an explosion on Thursday that tore a gaping hole in the hull of the Cole during a refueling stop in Yemen. American officials believe it was an act of terrorism.</p>
        <p>The Navy confirmed yesterday that 17 sailors, including Seaman Francis, were killed. Roughly three dozen others were injured, some of them seriously.</p>
        <p>The majority of the victims came from small towns speckled across 11 states. Two were young women. A few were veteran sailors. Most had barely entered their 20's and were just beginning to frame the dimensions and aspirations of their adult lives. Several were still teenagers.</p>
        <p>A few of them were nearing the end of their enlistments and had been making plans to embark on civilian opportunities.</p>
        <p>Lakeina Francis was hardly in the Navy. She had finished basic training only in June. ''Three weeks ago, she was here with us,'' said Marcea Hamilton, a family friend.</p>
        <p>She seemed destined, though, to go into the Navy. Her father, Ronald Francis, was a Navy man. The cover of her high school yearbook when she graduated showed a ship. The inscription over the image said, ''The Last Journey,'' and underneath the picture was the word, ''Unsinkable.''</p>
        <p>The other woman among the 17 sailors was Seaman Recruit Lakiba Nicole Palmer of San Diego.</p>
        <p>One of the many injustices of the tragedy is it claimed people who were so close to removing themselves from danger.</p>
        <p>Petty Officer Third Class Ronchester Santiago, 22, of Kingsville, Tex., had joined the Navy in 1996 and was scheduled to leave in December, when he planned to go to college to study electrical engineering.</p>
        <p>Engineman Second Class Marc Nieto, 24, of Fond du Lac, Wis., joined the Navy six years ago and was even closer to a fresh path. He was about a month away from leaving the Navy. He planned to stay around Norfolk because of a woman he had met. About eight months ago, he fell in love with fellow engine worker on the ship who was injured in the blast. Seaman Nieto was thinking of looking for technical work in the area until her tour ended.</p>
        <p>So many of those among the casualties were brand new to the Navy. There was Seaman Recruit Cherone Louis Gunn, 22, a signalman and the son of a retired Navy man, who grew up in Virginia Beach and had been living in Rex, Ga. He wanted to become a state trooper but decided to join the Navy first to get some experience. He enlisted in January.</p>
        <p>Timothy Lee Gauna, 21, of Rice, Tex., an information systems technician, had joined the Navy last year as a radio specialist. His mother, Sarah Gauna, clutched school photographs of him yesterday as she watched television news dispatches at her home at the Cottonwood Mobile Home Park in Rice, hoping for word that they had found her son and that he was O.K. She said he enlisted to get training to become a computer scientist.</p>
        <p>''It was his first time overseas, and he didn't like it,'' she said. ''He kept saying: 'I can't wait until I get home. I can't wait until I get off the water.' ''</p>
        <p>In addition to Seaman Francis, there was a trio of 19-year-olds. An engineman fireman, Joshua Parlett, joined the Navy last year after finishing high school in Churchville, Md.</p>
        <p>It was the same story with Seaman Apprentice Craig Bryan Wibberley, 19, who graduated last year from high school with an abiding passion for technology. ''He saw the Navy as his opportunity to build on those skills,'' said Scott Bragunier, 21, who went to high school with him.</p>
        <p>He came from Williamsport, Md. His father, Thomas Wibberley, a construction supervisor and a former Marine, said his son was also a devoted fisherman, especially fly-fishing. The two of them had recently spent time together tinkering with the family's 1971 Corvette. While on the Cole, Craig was taking college courses, his father said, hoping to advance within the Navy. He kept in touch with his family and friends by e-mail, using a laptop computer he had borrowed from a teacher.</p>
        <p>And it was a similar story with Seaman Apprentice Patrick Roy, a fireman from Keedysville, a Maryland town of just 500 people. He had attended the Storm King School in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y., where he was captain of the lacrosse team and managed the wrestling team. Partly because he didn't have a lot of money for college, he entered the Navy last year after graduation.</p>
        <p>In July, just before boarding the Cole, he visited his boarding school and showed pictures of the destroyer to the faculty. ''He was very excited and a little scared,'' said Tammy Purdy, the school's director of alumni affairs.</p>
        <p>The entire school assembled in the campus theater at 1 p.m. yesterday to remember Mr. Roy. Then they filed outside to the flagpole and lowered the flag to half-mast.</p>
        <p>They observed a moment of silence for Seaman Roy and another moment to pray for peace in the Middle East. Classes were canceled for the balance of the afternoon, but sports went on, because that was how the school decided Seaman Roy would have wanted it.</p>
        <p>There were, as well, some veterans caught in the tragedy on the ship. Electronics Technician First Class Richard Costelow, 35, from Morrisville, Pa., had been in the Navy since the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>An electronics warfare technician second class, Kevin Shawn Rux, 30, of Portland, N.D., considered himself career Navy. It made sense. His father was career Navy. His uncle was career Navy. He spent 10 years in the Navy, left briefly to be a police officer, then rejoined a year ago.</p>
        <p>Ensign Andrew Triplett, 31, of Macon, Miss., had put in 13 years. He had a wife and two children, and he lived with them in Virginia Beach.</p>
        <p>His mother, Savannah Triplett, works as a cook frying chicken and baking cornbread at the C &amp; K Superstore in Shuqualak, Miss., and she sat limp on her living room couch yesterday wearing a sweat shirt that declared, ''God keeps his promises.''</p>
        <p>She said she never wanted her son to join the Navy. ''I always feared this happening,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But she said she understood his need to go. There wasn't a lot of opportunity where they lived. Three of her five sons joined the military, though the other two were out of the service.</p>
        <p>In August, just before Ensign Triplett began his final assignment, he spent a week visiting his parents. He put a new hood on the stove.</p>
        <p>Seaman Gary Swenchonis Jr., 26, a fireman from Rockport on the Texas Gulf Coast, had served four years in the Army, stationed at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. It was limiting for a young man imbued with chronic wanderlust. In March 1999, to satisfy his yearning to see more of the world, he joined the Navy.</p>
        <p>Deborah Swenchonis, his mother, said he found it a perfect fit and had decided to make it his career. On the Cole, he worked in the engineering department, where he helped to maintain the ship's air-conditioning system. The Cole's home port is in Norfolk, Va., and it had done maneuvers off the Virginia coast and as far south as Puerto Rico, but his mother said it was the trip to the Middle East that excited her son.</p>
        <p>''He was having a good time,'' she said, judging from e-mails he had sent. ''He had souvenirs he was going to send home. He had some pictures he was going to develop so we could all enjoy what he had seen.''</p>
        <p>Also among the seven who died in the explosion were Operations Specialist Second Class Timothy Lamont Saunders of Ringgold, Va., and Seaman James Rodrick McDaniels of Norfolk, Va.,</p>
        <p>Seaman McDaniels had enlisted only last summer and soon decided not to make a full career at sea, his mother, Diane McDaniels, said in her Norfolk apartment.</p>
        <p>''The last time I saw him, when he was shipping out in August, I saw there were tears running down his cheeks,'' she said. ''He was sad. That's the way I remember him.''</p>
        <p>Her son had decided to marry his high school sweetheart as soon as he returned from this deployment, Mrs. McDaniels said.</p>
        <p>''The Navy told me he's coming back here soon,'' she said of her son's remains. ''I can't imagine being able to look at him messed up. He had the sweetest dimples. My boy was only 19. I can't imagine putting him in the ground.'' Among the others killed were Hull Maintenance Technician Third Class Kenneth Eugene Clodfelter, 21, of Mechanicsville, Va., who had planned to sign up for another tour of duty in January, and Electronics Warfare Technician Third Class Ronald Scott Owens, 24, of Vero Beach, Fla., who was married and the father of a 4-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>Donna Scott, his mother-in-law, said he e-mailed her a few days ago and told her, ''Take care of my girls.''</p>
