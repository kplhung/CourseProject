        <p>Mitchell Austin should have been on the football field this afternoon. He should have been tearing open the defensive line from his spot at right guard. It's something that Mitchell, a 6-foot-1, 300-pound senior at Erasmus Hall High School, does particularly well.</p>
        <p>Instead, he said, he will be at home punching through his homework and cramming for the SAT's. Once, Mitchell hoped to make it into college on a football scholarship. He had heard that Syracuse University was interested. But now, with what could have been a season of memorable plays and scouting tapes cut short, he just wants to make it into college any way he can.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the varsity football program at Erasmus folded, shutting down a Brooklyn dynasty that had produced football luminaries like Al Davis, the owner of the Oakland Raiders, and Sid Luckman, the quarterback of the 1940's Chicago Bears. When the season was scratched on Sept. 28 after only one game, the abrupt ending broke a tradition that stretched back more than a century. It also broke the hearts of Mitchell Austin and his teammates on the Erasmus squad.</p>
        <p>''I was planning to use football as a tool to get to college,'' said Mitchell, an eloquent, hulking boy of 17 whose ferocity on the ball field belies a gentle temper. ''But now this throws everything off. I'm a little confused. I don't know what I'm going to do.''</p>
        <p>The disappearance of the Erasmus Dutchmen this year -- early in the season, without warning, and with no immediate explanation -- is just another in what has been, over recent decades, a string of vanishing public high school athletic programs. The Board of Education acknowledges that the money it provides for sports is not enough.</p>
        <p>The demise of the Erasmus football squad occurred in a sort of civic silence that was broken only by the angry shouts of the players and their families. There has scarcely been any public comment from either City Hall or the Board of Education. Could an extracurricular program of similar renown -- the science contest program at the Bronx High School of Science, for example -- vanish with so little public outcry?</p>
        <p>The problems at Erasmus started small.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 22, the head coach, Robert Fennell, was fired after allowing his team to play against Far Rockaway High School without getting the inner padding of their helmets reconditioned, a violation of public school sports regulations. Six days later, the school's administration made an announcement: There would be no more football games for the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Fennell admits he broke the rules, he insists the helmets were safe. (''I asked myself, 'Would I play in those helmets or would I let a son of mine play in them?' '' he said. ''And the answer is yes.'') Then again, he says, the helmets were not the real problem to begin with.</p>
        <p>The real problem, he says, is a conflict over money. While officials of the Board of Education say that Erasmus's budget for the football program this year was $670, out of $2,600 for all the school's athletic programs, Mr. Fennell said that he received only $200. Fixing the helmets alone was a $700 job, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's ridiculous,'' Mr. Fennell went on, ''and I told the principals that it was ridiculous. I managed to buy $76 worth of ankle tape and replace some jockstraps. But they really didn't care what the $200 did or didn't cover.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fennell, 63, is a skinny man who goes about town with a whistle hanging from his neck, and he likes to call his team ''the boys.'' He started coaching at Erasmus in 1982. To make ends meet over the years, he said, he has supported the squad with more than $75,000 of his own money. He said he bought all the team jerseys last year. In previous years, he has paid for the buses to take his players to and from their scrimmages. He said he often gave students subway tokens to get to their practice sessions. He joked that he always wanted to drive a Range Rover and that if he had kept his money for himself, he could have been driving two by now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fennell has apparently carried the team so well that until he was fired and the season was scratched, his players never even knew it was barely surviving. ''I thought we had everything we needed,'' said Matthew Holley, a 10th grader who played on both the offensive and defensive lines. ''We had enough pads and stuff. We had enough of everything. The helmets felt fine to me. I didn't even know they weren't checked.''</p>
        <p>The death of Erasmus football is clearly about money, Mr. Fennell and other team boosters say, but it also goes deeper than money. After all, the high school has plenty of wealthy, generous alumni, including Mr. Davis; Jerry Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Bulls; and Robert Tisch, an owner of the New York Giants. Mr. Davis, for example, has said that he has been in touch with his fellow Erasmus graduates and that they are willing to provide the school with whatever money it needs.</p>
        <p>The root of the trouble, in Mr. Fennell's opinion, is the school administration's apparent lack of interest in a football program. ''The school is just not concerned about football,'' he said. ''They didn't want to do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>It is impossible to tell what the school wanted to do. None of Erasmus's three principals were willing to comment on the decision to shut down the football team. The school's athletic director, Alan Zarrow, would not discuss the team.</p>
        <p>''It's unconscionable,'' said Al Arbuse, the football commissioner for the Public Schools Athletic League, which regulates public school sports for New York City. ''There is a lot of outside support for the Erasmus team, but the commitment has to come from within. If they were unwilling to make the commitment, then they never should've had the program. The only ones who wind up getting hurt now are the kids.''</p>
        <p>Erasmus is not the only high school football team to have its season canceled this year. Adlai E. Stevenson High School in the Bronx has folded its team, and the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics and Flushing High School in Queens missed two games each and are perilously close to going down the drain as well, Mr. Arbuse said.</p>
        <p>Donald Roth, the deputy superintendent of Brooklyn high schools, has sworn that school officials will not let the Erasmus football program lie fallow beyond this year. On Thursday, school officials met with a group of parents whose children played on the team to set forth a plan to resume football games next year.</p>
        <p>Renee Holley, Matthew Holley's mother, said the Board of Education promised to give Erasmus about $8,000 next year for varsity and junior varsity teams. While the offer was welcome, it falls far short of the $35,000 that she, other parents and the team's assistant coaches believe is needed to revive the program.</p>
        <p>''We were disappointed to an extent,'' Ms. Holley said. ''We thought we were going to get more help.''</p>
        <p>Over two decades, the burden of maintaining school athletics has shifted from city government to the schools, making it increasingly difficult for schools like Erasmus, on Flatbush and Bedford Avenues, to support their teams. The Board of Education gives money for athletic programs to the schools each year based on school population and the number of teams each school maintains, Mr. Roth said.</p>
        <p>The public money, while always welcome, is rarely enough and must be supplemented with whatever it takes -- bake sales, raffles, concerts and team-sponsored vending machines. ''It's true that each school does not get a lot of money,'' Mr. Roth said. ''But typically, they put in funds from other sources depending on what other athletic programs they have and what they can afford to give to football.''</p>
        <p>The city has no emergency fund to rescue football programs, said Michael Anton, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, although in July, it did establish a program with Mr. Tisch called Take the Field to refurbish sports fields at schools in each of the five boroughs.</p>
        <p>''The city gives the Board of Education $11 billion a year, so somewhere in there presumably there's money for athletics,'' Mr. Anton said.</p>
        <p>At Erasmus, perhaps the lack of money has been acutely felt simply because of the status the school enjoys in Brooklyn. Although the team had an off-season last year, Mr. Luckman roamed its football field in the 1930's. Sam Rutigliano, the former coach of the Cleveland Browns, played there, too. There was more to Erasmus than football: Barbra Streisand sang in the school choir.</p>
        <p>Nostalgia and fear for the future have galvanized some alumni, including Charles Young, who played offensive guard before graduating in 1976. Mr. Young, who teaches physical education at the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology in Bay Ridge, said that although the deal worked out with the Board of Education would salvage the future of Erasmus football, the current season was done.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, all we can do is look toward next year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Which, of course, are just the words that Mitchell Austin does not want to hear. His mother, Lystra, has offered to move to another school district with a high school football team just so he can play. She knows that an all-star season could mean a scholarship.</p>
        <p>Mitchell remains hopeful that Erasmus's season will resume.</p>
        <p>''The way I see it, life is a problem itself,'' he said. ''You just have to know how to handle it, how to roll with what you get.''</p>
