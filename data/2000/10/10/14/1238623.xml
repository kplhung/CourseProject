        <p>A federal jury in Manhattan yesterday awarded $1.25 million in damages to a former officer who had accused the Police Department of retaliating because she complained that she had been sexually harassed on the job.</p>
        <p>In her suit, the officer, Gloria Gonzalez, accused a wide range of police supervisors of trying to punish her for filing a sexual harassment complaint against a lieutenant who supervised her in the Bronx in 1994. After filing the internal complaint, Officer Gonzalez said she was routinely cited for minor violations and was given poor work assignments. She ultimately resigned from the force in 1996 while facing disciplinary charges.</p>

        <p>A federal jury in Manhattan yesterday awarded $1.25 million in damages to a former officer who had accused the Police Department of retaliating because she complained that she had been sexually harassed on the job.</p>
        <p>In her suit, the officer, Gloria Gonzalez, accused a wide range of police supervisors of trying to punish her for filing a sexual harassment complaint against a lieutenant who supervised her in the Bronx in 1994. After filing the internal complaint, Officer Gonzalez said she was routinely cited for minor violations and was given poor work assignments. She ultimately resigned from the force in 1996 while facing disciplinary charges.</p>
        <p>In its verdict, the United States District Court jury did not find that Ms. Gonzalez had been sexually harassed. But it did find that police officials had retaliated against her and had forced her to resign.</p>
        <p>''I think the jury recognized that the city's conduct concerning the method in which it handled Gloria Gonzalez's case was unprofessional and retaliatory,'' said Norman A. Senior, one of her lawyers.</p>
        <p>A significant witness for Ms. Gonzalez was a former Police Department investigator, Adam Alvarez, who had been assigned to pursue the disciplinary case against her in 1996. He testified that he had been pressured by Michael A. Markman, the department's former chief of personnel, to ''expedite'' the case and that at least six police units had been assigned at one point or another to internal investigations of the officer.</p>
        <p>In court, city lawyers characterized Mr. Alvarez as a disgruntled former employee who had filed his own lawsuit against the department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Markman was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit and could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>After the verdict, Ms. Gonzalez, in the press room of Police Headquarters, expressed her satisfaction. ''I feel vindicated,'' she said, ''but not completely, because the sexual harassment did exist. But I am happy that they did find the retaliation, because it was immense, it was overwhelming, it was something that no human being should go through.''</p>
        <p>City lawyers said that they would appeal.</p>
        <p>The city said at trial that Ms. Gonzalez had become a problem officer whose work had slipped and who had to be suspended six times for abusing sick leave. The city lawyers said she had agreed to resign after being served with administrative charges for refusing to take a drug test.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gonzalez said she had been frightened to take the test, which she viewed as a form of retaliation.</p>
        <p>City lawyers said many of the officials accused of having participated in retaliation were people who did not even know that Ms. Gonzalez had filed a sexual harassment complaint and had no stake in its outcome.</p>
        <p>''We are disappointed that the jury believed a totally incredible tale of conspiracy by a plaintiff who abused all the privileges of her office, including a refusal to take a drug test and abuse of sick leave policy,'' said Lorna Bade Goodman, a spokeswoman for the City Law Department.</p>
        <p>This is the second case this year in which the Police Department has been accused of retaliating against an employee. In June, the city agreed to pay $1 million to settle a lawsuit by a former deputy police commissioner, Sandra M. Marsh, who said she had been forced from her job after refusing to revise an internal report critical of department supervisors.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gonzalez, who spent 12 years on the force, was assigned to the 45th Precinct in the Bronx in 1994 when she filed an internal complaint that her lieutenant had harassed her by pressing her to socialize with him, among other things. From that point on, she said, she was subject to transfers and disciplinary charges that she said were intended to force her from her job. When she resigned in 1996, she reserved the right to sue and filed her suit later that year.</p>
        <p>The $1.25 million verdict against the city included $1 million in compensatory damages for lost wages and $250,000 for emotional distress. In addition, three other police officials were found personally liable for punitive damages, which will be set by the judge at a later date, said lawyers in the case.</p>
        <p>One official was a former police commander assigned to the 50th Precinct in the Bronx, accused in the lawsuit of having had other officers harass Ms. Gonzalez by writing her up for small violations. A second official was a police surgeon accused of ignoring her medical problems as part of the pattern of retaliation. The third official was a former police supervisor in the 40th Precinct who the lawsuit charged had wrongfully had Ms. Gonzalez detained for 27 hours on criminal impersonation charges after she was stopped for running a red light.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gonzalez was acquitted of the charges in State Supreme Court in the Bronx. City officials said they found nothing wrong with the conduct of any of the officials.</p>
