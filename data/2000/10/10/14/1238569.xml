        <p>The Softbank Corporation, one of the biggest Internet investment companies, said today that it would establish revolving credit lines with 10 banks for roughly $1.3 billion to provide more flexibility in raising money quickly.</p>
        <p>The announcement underscored the financial management problem Softbank faces, since it generates almost no cash flow on its own. Rather, the company must sell stakes in its more than 400 investments or tap the capital markets to obtain cash. Neither of those options is attractive right now because the markets have grown far more volatile and the global appetite for technology investments has diminished.</p>
        <p>Analysts say the company has $1 billion to $2 billion in cash in the United States from the sale of its stakes in Trend Micro, Yahoo and other holdings there, so the new credit line is not a sign of financial desperation.</p>
        <p>But Softbank faces double taxation if it repatriates that money to Japan, where it has fewer investments that can easily be turned into cash. ''They are very short of short-term liquidity in Japan, so they're trying to give themselves more flexibility here,'' said Benjamin Wedmore, an analyst at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. ''That's probably a smart thing to do, but at the same time, it underlines all of the questions one has about Softbank.''</p>
        <p>The company's biggest investment, its stake in Yahoo and the portal's various international subsidiaries, keeps losing value, a development that has made investors cautious. Establishing a value for Softbank is difficult since, analysts say, its complex constellation of investments is hard to appraise independently.</p>
        <p>So Softbank's shares tend to move in tandem with shares of Yahoo, which are down more than 77 percent from their peak in January. At the end of August, Mr. Wedmore estimated that Softbank's pretax gains in Yahoo stood at 1.7 trillion yen, or about $15.9 billion at current exchange rates, but the drop in Yahoo's stock price has cut those gains in half.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as Yahoo continues to issue options to its employees as compensation, Softbank's stake in the company is being diluted, making it even more difficult to assess the company's value.</p>
        <p>And its investments in Internet start-ups like Webvan and Buy.com are taking a beating as those companies stocks are pummeled.</p>
        <p>Investors were also unnerved last week when Softbank said it had lost 19.3 billion yen, or about $180 million, selling a 33 percent stake in Able, a condominium broker.</p>
