        <p>AS the self-proclaimed capital of the world, New York City has long reserved the right to its own foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Never mind what the State Department or the White House may think. From Edward I. Koch to Rudolph W. Giuliani, leaders of the P.R.N.Y. (that's the People's Republic of New York) have not shied from going their own way on matters like Middle East peace and the performance of that perfidious enclave on the East Side known as the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Other elected officials here have had their own issues: apartheid in the old South Africa, relations with Fidel Castro's Cuba, the shelling of Vieques island by the United States military, to list a few. Often enough, New York policies have not fallen in lockstep with Washington's.</p>
        <p>You could admire this independent streak as proof of our local leaders' moral courage. But common sense tells you that raw ethnic politics goes a long way to explain what issues are discussed.</p>
        <p>Why else has the New York Senate race managed to come up with only one foreign policy concern, the ugly struggle between Israel and the Palestinians? If either candidate has a thought about ethnic violence in Africa, or what to do about Yugoslavia, or how to keep India and Pakistan from nuking each other, it has yet to bubble to the surface of this campaign.</p>
        <p>Obviously, Israel and the Palestinians are as hot a topic as there could be. But there is really little to no daylight between the basic positions of the Senate candidates, even if Representative Rick A. Lazio was cheered and Hillary Rodham Clinton was jeered by the large crowd at a pro-Israel rally here on Thursday.</p>
        <p>By now, there seems nothing that Mrs. Clinton can do to win over many of her critics on the Jewish right. But let's get real. Is there a candidate for high office in this city or state who ever got elected on an anti-Israel platform? Here's another reality check. There is not much that any senator can do about the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that will change with a true Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement (a prospect that looks more distant right now than the star Vega). It would then fall to Congress to approve aid packages that seem likely to be part of any deal. For the moment, though, the only Washington players who count are in the executive branch.</p>
        <p>Yet this is the only international issue to get serious attention in the Senate race.</p>
        <p>Are no voters curious, for example, what the candidates think about leaving American forces in Kosovo, now that Slobodan Milosevic has been ousted? Whether to continue financing the peace-keeping mission is certainly an important question that members of Congress, including the next junior senator from New York, will have to answer. Yet you hear not a peep about it.</p>
        <p>IS it being overly cynical to ask whether one reason may be that ethnic Serbs and Albanians do not exactly form a critical mass in New York?</p>
        <p>Remember this, though: Issues can change as the city's ethnic sands shift. Northern Ireland is a case in point. You hear almost nothing in the Senate race about how the United States might enhance the quest for peace. Once upon a time, such silence would have been unimaginable. What has changed? For one thing, name a politician of Irish origin in today's New York who has citywide, or even boroughwide, power.</p>
        <p>Back-to-back rallies in Manhattan on the Middle East -- pro-Israel on Thursday, pro-Palestinian yesterday -- gave a glimpse of how New York's foreign policy could be altered once more in the not-too-distant future.</p>
        <p>The Israel demonstration seemed bigger than the march by Arabs and other Muslims. But it wasn't vastly bigger. Time was, not so long ago, when any comparison between the two would have been a joke.</p>
        <p>But in case you hadn't noticed, New York demographics are changing fast. By the count of the American Jewish Committee, the city's Jewish population is 1,050,000, not nearly as high as it was years ago. The number of Muslims is much harder to fix, but some estimates put it as high as 500,000. And growing.</p>
        <p>You might want to note that major New York politicians, including both Senate candidates, went only to the pro-Israel demonstration. Not one showed up at the Palestinian counterpart.</p>
        <p>Nobody suggests that the officials' support for Israel, especially in this crisis, is anything but sincere. Still, it would not come as a shock if, one day, senior elected officials in New York discovered themselves shouting not only ''Am Yisrael chai'' in Hebrew -- the people of Israel live -- but also ''Allahu akbar'' in Arabic -- God is great.</p>
