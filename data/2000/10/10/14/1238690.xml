        <p>A huge Israeli security cordon prevented thousands of Palestinians from attending Friday Prayer services at the ancient mosques inside the Old City today, a move that further angered Muslims here but kept the embattled holy site from exploding anew into violent confrontation.</p>
        <p>Heavily armed Israeli riot policemen were under orders to keep all men under 45 from entering the mosque compound, the scene of clashes with Palestinians the last two Fridays. Many young Muslim men were stopped at the Old City gates, where chanting, stone-throwing protesters battled policemen on horseback. Israeli sharpshooters crouched at the ready behind the crenelated parapets of the city's 14th-century walls.</p>
        <p>Inside, many Old City residents were also turned away from the inner gates to the mosque sanctum by knots of helmeted, flak-jacketed Israeli border guards. Women and older men were ushered in. But with the Israeli Army, on high alert since Thursday, blocking roads out of the West Bank, few Muslims from outside East Jerusalem were able even to approach the Old City today.</p>
        <p>Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the grand mufti of the Aksa and Dome of the Rock mosque complex, gave an angry sermon decrying the ''Israeli occupation of our holy site'' before some 3,000 worshipers, about a fifth the size of a normal Friday congregation.</p>
        <p>''We have never seen the mosque so empty for Friday Prayer services,'' he said in an interview later. ''This is unjust. Israel is preventing people from practicing their faith, a crime that the whole world should condemn.''</p>
        <p>Israeli police officials, however, said they were pleased that they had averted a third consecutive Friday of riots at the sacred plaza, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, or Haram al Sharif. The regionally televised images of pitched battles with the police at the site two weeks ago -- battles that left six Palestinians dead -- ignited further deadly clashes throughout the Palestinian territories and Israel itself.</p>
        <p>''We did what we did in order to prevent more violent outbreaks, and as a result the day went by without any extraordinary incidents,'' an Israeli police official said.</p>
        <p>But it remained a day of acute tension throughout Israel and the Palestinian territories, still shaken by the politically devastating sequence on Thursday of the mob slaying of two Israeli soldiers and retaliatory airstrikes by Israeli helicopters.</p>
        <p>Despite reports of an imminent summit meeting, neither side seemed ready to heed international calls for restraint and reconciliation. Israelis across the political spectrum demanded a strong show of military force in the streets today, while Palestinians in protest marches across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip vowed to confront Israeli troops with stones and rifles until the Israelis were forced to pull out.</p>
        <p>''The uprising and the confrontations will continue,'' Marwan Bar ghouti, a top lieutenant to Yasir Arafat and the leader of the West Bank's biggest paramilitary force, told a crowd of thousands in Ramallah. A short while later, some from that crowd were engaged in a brief but fierce gun battle with four Israeli tanks hunkered down on Ramallah's outskirts.</p>
        <p>In Hebron, at least one Palestinian, 22-year-old Mansur Sayed Ammad, was killed in clashes with Israeli troops, which escalated from rock-throwing to sniper exchanges and left a dozen people wounded, Palestinians said. Mr. Ammad's death is the 98th confirmed fatality from the street fighting of the last 16 days. The rioters were repulsed from attacking a small Jewish enclave in the heart of the Palestinian-controlled city, according to the Israeli military.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Jewish settlers in Hebron accused the Israeli Army of exercising excessive restraint in its battles with Palestinian gunmen there.</p>
        <p>A group of settlers met this morning with Gen. Benny Ganz, the commander of Israel's forces in the West Bank, and demanded that Israel use helicopters and other heavy weapons ''not only to scare the terrorist attackers, but also to shoot at them,''  they said.</p>
