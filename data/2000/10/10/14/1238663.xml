        <p>Keith Van Horn had his left knee wrapped in ice but he was still smiling, if not glowing, under the lights of the Nets' practice facility. They seem to be casting a sunny tint in the swamplands this year.</p>
        <p>For Van Horn, it is a world away from last season.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I'm a kid again, that this is what basketball is all about,'' Van Horn said. The Nets stumbled to a 31-51 record under Coach Don Casey last season, and Van Horn indicated the team lacked direction and chemistry. He said today that he had been unhappy last season and was uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>''There were periods last year where I hated coming here,'' Van Horn said. ''But now I feel renewed. I feel like I'm part of a true basketball team. I feel like I have direction.''</p>
        <p>After two weeks of practice and one preseason victory, the team's new coach, Byron Scott, has instilled respect and installed defensive schemes.</p>
        <p>''I've always said the success of the team is predicated upon the direction you get from the coach, and Byron is giving us a lot of direction this year,'' Van Horn said. ''We all feel confident, and his professionalism filters to the players. I look forward to coming here every day.''</p>
        <p>The Nets left after today's practice for a three-game, six-day trip, beginning Saturday with their second preseason game against the Miami Heat. Because he has strained ligaments in his left knee -- a result of continual banging during the first week of practice -- Van Horn will sit out the first game of the trip.</p>
        <p>Today he did shooting drills and rode an exercise bike. After missing four days of practice already, he expects to resume workouts Sunday and return for Tuesday's game against Orlando.</p>
        <p>Despite the Nets' long practices -- Scott's sessions last about three hours -- Van Horn is eager to participate again. ''You're so tired after practice, but I had that in college and that's how you win,'' he said. ''You show up and you enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>Center Evan Eschmeyer said: ''I'm sure there'll be ups and downs throughout the season, but over all the general mood is that of a team that is expecting to improve and having fun playing every day.''</p>
        <p>Said point guard Stephon Marbury: ''Keith is responding, I'm responding. As a team, we're accepting the challenge.''</p>
        <p>Last season the challenge was not structured enough. ''I feel like I'd come here and not be getting anywhere,'' Van Horn said.</p>
        <p>After two strong seasons Van Horn, a 6-foot-10, 255-pound forward, was going nowhere at the beginning of last season. He  had trouble making his short jumper but kept grinding until he turned his game around in the second half.</p>
        <p>In 31 games after the All-Star Game break, a vacation for him, he averaged 20.4 points and 9.2 rebounds, shooting 48.3 percent from the floor. He shot 41.6 percent during the first half of the season. Over all, he averaged 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds, and shot 44.5 percent.</p>
        <p>''I think Keith needed to be in a situation where he knew exactly where he was supposed to be on the court at all times,'' Scott said. ''His athletic ability comes out. Everybody says he's not a great defender, but he's not that bad. He knows where he should be, he has structure and he understands.''</p>
        <p>With Scott creating harmony, Van Horn feels as if he has joined a whole new team. Van Horn is playing for his third coach since joining the Nets. Philadelphia made him the No. 2 pick in the 1997 draft and traded him to the Nets before the season.  ''I feel like I've been traded three times, actually,'' Van Horn said with a laugh. This time, so far, it feels right.</p>
