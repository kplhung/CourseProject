      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Israel buried Vadim Norzich today, and with him much of its hope for real peace.</p>
        <p>The image of Mr. Norzich's bloody body being thrown to a Palestinian mob hovered over the graveyard here -- even as the dirt was tossed, the wreaths were laid and the mourning prayer was chanted.</p>
        <p>Few Israelis could shake this image from their heads. Overnight, it made an indelible mark on the national psyche, ''etched for eternity into the history of the conflict,'' Nahum Barnea, a columnist, wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norzich, 35, an immigrant from Siberia, a truck driver and a newlywed, became lost in the West Bank on his way to report for reserve duty and ended up in an angry crowd in Ramallah, the Israelis said. With a fellow reserve soldier, Yossi Avrahami, he was stabbed, stomped, beaten and burned to death at a Palestinian police station. Afterward, cheering Palestinians paraded his pummeled body down a main street.</p>
        <p>In retaliation, Israel called on helicopters to shell the West Bank and Gaza. Illustrating the deteriorating relationship, Israel gave a glimpse of its military might in attacking Palestinian institutions that it had helped bring into being.</p>
        <p>Today, Israelis and Palestinians were in a state of shock. An after-the-storm stillness descended as they tried to absorb the blows of a traumatic Thursday. Capping a checkered seven-year-peace effort, the two sides had pushed themselves to the brink of a new era of hostilities. Even if the Americans succeed in engineering a summit meeting this weekend, it would be to pull the two sides back from the brink. Truce, not peace, is the new goal.</p>
        <p>''The Ramallah lynching will go down in history as the turning point in the present conflict and as an indelible stain on the entire peace process,'' Ron Milberg wrote on the front page of Maariv this morning.</p>
        <p>On the morning after the mob and the missiles, Israel, which prides itself on allowing freedom of worship at Al Aksa Mosque, prevented Muslims younger than 45 from attending Friday Prayer. Soldiers blocked entry into Jerusalem from the West Bank and ringed the religious complex at the heart of the Old City.</p>
        <p>''Please don't speak to soldiers today,'' an army spokesman said at the funeral. ''They have that picture in their head. They're liable to say all sorts of things that will hurt the army's image.''</p>
        <p>The frozen frame of Mr. Norzich's plunging head down into the mob is the Israeli counterpart of the Muhammad al-Durrah image, the picture that for Palestinians captured the horror of this conflict.</p>
        <p>Muhammad was the 12-year-old shot dead by Israeli troops in a gun battle in Gaza, caught on film by a French cameraman, as the boy cowered behind his father and then slumped dead in his lap. The pictures, so unequivocally horrifying, became powerful media tools for the Palestinian assertion that the ruthless Israeli military machine was massacring its people.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Israeli rightists seized on the chilling pictures of the mob killing as crystal evidence of the bankruptcy of the peace effort. After all, they said today, the mob had gathered inside a police station of a government that has been engaged in a cooperative security relationship with the Israelis.</p>
        <p>The images shook Israelis across the political spectrum, too, with the palpable hatred cutting to the quick and reviving the specter of pogroms.</p>
        <p>For Palestinians, the punishment outweighed the crime, or rather it was misdirected. However surgical the Israeli strikes, they terrorized the citizens of Ramallah and Gaza City. But in Israel, very few questioned the move. Or if they did, it was to wonder why the rocket attack  stopped. The leftists were stunned into silence.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict turns into a tug of war over who in this heart-wrenching conflict is most aggrieved. At a taping this week in Jerusalem of ''Nightline'' for ABC News, a religious Israeli man shouted at Palestinian audience members, ''You're not the only ones who suffer!''</p>
        <p>He added that his brother had been a victim of terror.</p>
        <p>A Palestinian woman, horrified, held up a picture of the crumpled Muhammad al-Durrah.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norzich, a reserve corporal, arrived in Israel eight years ago and settled in a Russian immigrant community in this coastal town. Today, his elderly mother stood graveside, whispering in Russian, ''I don't believe it,'' as soldiers poured water on her head to keep her from fainting.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Norzich married a Kazakh immigrant, Irena, who was too disconsolate to attend the funeral. When he received his orders to report for reserve duty, he asked for a delay as a newlywed. But the army rejected his request.</p>
        <p>At 7 a.m. on Thursday, he left home to travel to the Israeli Army post near Palestinian-governed Ramallah. He first picked up his buddy, Mr. Avrahami, in Petah Tiqva. The army said today that there was never a third soldier with them. On Thursday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said they were investigating that possibility.</p>
        <p>At 9:30, his wife, who is pregnant, tried to call him on his cellular telephone. Someone answered, she recounted, and he said, ''Vadim.'' The phone then clicked off.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian information minister, Yasir Abed Rabbo, said today that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, had ordered an investigation into the killings. ''We will not allow atrocities,'' Mr. Abed Rabbo said.</p>
        <p>At the funeral today, Mr. Norzich's older brother, Michael, his voice broken, urged thousands of mourners to rise above their emotions. ''Mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, I beg of you, don't stoop to their level,'' Mr. Norzich said.</p>
        <p>An elderly immigrant woman blew kisses at the honor guard as they somberly filed out of the cemetery. ''You are our sons, you are our country, you are our faith,'' she said in heavily accented Hebrew. ''We will hold you back from the window. We will hold you back from the grave.''</p>
