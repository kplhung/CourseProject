        <p>FRANCE: MAYOR OUSTED FROM PARTY  Mayor Jean Tiberi of Paris, who has been trying to hold onto his job despite being the focus of several investigations into corruption and vote fixing, has been dealt another blow. Already forced to give up leadership of the local branch of the Rally for the Republic, he has now been ousted from the party altogether. Mr. Tiberi, who insisted he would run for re-election, said he had been ''humiliated and mistreated'' by his Gaullist party.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: KURSK THEORIES  Experts investigating the sinking of the submarine Kursk no longer believe a collision with a foreign submarine is the likely cause of the tragedy. No evidence of a collision was found during a search of the seabed floor, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said. Mr. Klebanov said that a collision had not been ruled out, but that other theories -- that the sub struck a World War II mine, or that a torpedo exploded -- appeared equally valid.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: PRESS BARON RESISTS QUESTIONS  Vladimir Gusinsky, the Russian businessman whose independent media empire is under Kremlin attack, said he would not leave Israel to answer questions from government prosecutors because he fears for his security. But Mr. Gusinsky, who denies state charges that he has hidden his companies' assets abroad, said he would meet investigators in Israel if they wished. Mr. Gusinsky holds dual Russian-Israeli citizenship.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: MILLENNIUM DOME TROUBLE  The Millennium Dome in London, already facing financial problems caused by low attendance, came under fresh criticism after four people were arrested on charges of fraud relating to contracts for services. Auditors say the financial management of the Dome has been lax. The structure, filled with themed exhibits, has cost over $1 billion in money from the National Lottery, but has been unable to pay for itself.</p>

        <p>BELARUS: VOTING DUE  Officials pledged to meet European standards for fairness in national parliamentary elections set for tomorrow, but democratic opposition parties and European observers have already said the vote is so obviously rigged that they will refuse to take part. Belarus's Soviet-style ruler, Aleksandr Lukashenko, said the vote would exhibit no ''Yugoslav variant,'' an allusion to the election that toppled Slobodan Milosevic.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: DALAI LAMA TO VISIT  The Buddhist spiritual leader is to travel to Belfast next week to urge Roman Catholics and Protestants to live in peace. He plans to cross Lanark Way, separating Protestant and Catholic areas, to meet with political leaders, and to plant a tree as a symbol of unity.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: ELECTION BOYCOTT  The leading opposition party, the Rally for the Republicans, called on members to boycott presidential elections Oct. 22. The Supreme Court ruled last week that the party's leader, Alassane Ouattara, and most other major candidates were not eligible to run against the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei. The former ruling party, the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, has also urged a boycott.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: LIBERAL LEAD GROWS  The governing Liberals increased their lead in opinion polls as the party prepares for an early federal election, set for late November. A poll for The Toronto Star showed Liberal support had risen to 50 percent from 48 percent, while backing for the right-wing Canadian Alliance stayed steady at 19 percent. The results will bolster the belief of Prime Minister Jean Chretien that he stands an excellent chance of defeating the right-wing Alliance of Stockwell Day.</p>

        <p>PERU: TALKS SUSPENDED  The Organization of American States said it had suspended talks that it was brokering between Peru's opposition and government to pave the way for elections next year. The move came after President Alberto Fujimori's ruling bloc in Congress passed a law delaying for two weeks any reforms that would free the news media, courts and vote-counting groups from government control.

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAQ, IRAN: TALKS ON TIES  Iran's foreign minister arrived in Baghdad to talk about prisoners of war, reparations and other issues lingering from the 1980-88 war between the two countries. Both Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi of Iran and his Iraqi counterpart, Muhammad Said al-Sahaf, expressed hope that their discussions would lead to normal ties.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: NEW GOVERNMENT FORMED  The ruling mPeople's Alliance, led by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, formed a working parliamentary majority and a new government with the support of Tamil and Muslim groups. Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, left, a hard-liner on the 17-year-old war with separatist Tamils, was sworn in as prime minister, a largely ceremonial role.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: BISHOPS SPEAK OUT  The Roman Catholic bishops of the Philippines called for a decisive end to the country's political crisis, including the resignation of President Joseph Estrada if necessary. Tensions rose in Manila as a private radio station said Mr. Estrada would declare a state of emergency, a report he denied. Allegations have linked Mr. Estrada to gambling syndicates.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>PHILIPPINES: U.S. HOSTAGE CALLED SAFE  An American hostage held by Muslim rebels is still alive, a guerrilla spokesman said, nearly a month after the military began a huge operation to rescue him and four other hostages. The spokesman said rumors that Jeffrey Schilling had been killed were untrue.</p>
