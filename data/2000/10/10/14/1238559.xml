        <p>Are computer games our era's new art form? And what is an art form, anyway? Henry Jenkins, the director of the comparative media studies program at M.I.T., raised these and other questions in his article ''Art Form for the Digital Age,'' which appeared in the September/October 2000 issue of Technology Review. Here are excerpts.</p>
        <p>Last year, Americans bought over 215 million computer and video games. That's more than two games per household. The video game industry made almost as much money from gross domestic income as Hollywood.</p>
        <p>So are video games a massive drain on our income, time and energy? A new form of ''cultural pollution,'' as one United States senator described them? The ''nightmare before Christmas,'' in the words of another? Are games teaching our children to kill, as countless Op-Ed pieces have warned?</p>
        <p>No. Computer games are art -- a popular art, an emerging art, a largely unrecognized art, but art nevertheless . . .</p>
        <p>The time has come to take games seriously as an important new popular art shaping the aesthetic sensibility of the 21st century. I will admit that discussing the art of video games conjures up comic images: tuxedo-clad and jewel-bedecked patrons admiring the latest Streetfighter, middle-aged academics pontificating on the impact of Cubism on Tetris, bleeps and zaps disrupting our silent contemplation at the Guggenheim. Such images tell us more about our contemporary notion of art -- as arid and stuffy, as the property of an educated and economic elite, as cut off from everyday experience -- than they tell us about games. . . .</p>
        <p>In 1925, the leading literary and arts critic Gilbert Seldes took a radical approach to the aesthetics of popular culture in a treatise titled ''The Seven Lively Arts.'' Adopting what was then a controversial position, Seldes argued that America's primary contributions to artistic expression had come through emerging forms of popular culture such as jazz, the Broadway musical, the Hollywood cinema and the comic strip. While these arts have gained cultural respectability over the past 75 years, each was disreputable when Seldes staked out his position.</p>
        <p>Readers then were skeptical of Seldes's claims about cinema in particular for many of the same reasons that contemporary critics dismiss games -- they were suspicious of cinema's commercial motivations and technological origins, concerned about Hollywood's appeals to violence and eroticism, and insistent that cinema had not yet produced works of lasting value. Seldes, on the other hand, argued that cinema's popularity demanded that we reassess its aesthetic qualities. . . .</p>
        <p>Much of what Seldes told us about the silent cinema seems remarkably apt for thinking about games. Silent cinema, he argued, was an art of expressive movement. He valued the speed and dynamism of D. W. Griffith's last-minute races to the rescue, the physical grace of Chaplin's pratfalls and the ingenuity of Buster Keaton's engineering feats. Games also depend upon an art of expressive movement, with characters defined through their distinctive ways of propelling themselves through space, and successful products structured around a succession of spectacular stunts and predicaments. Will future generations look back on Lara Croft doing battle with a pack of snarling wolves as the 21st-century equivalent of Lillian Gish making her way across the ice floes in Way Down East? . . .</p>
        <p>Seldes wrote at a moment when cinema was maturing as an expressive medium and filmmakers were striving to enhance the emotional experience of going to the movies -- making a move from mere spectacle towards character and consequence. It remains to be seen whether games can make a similar transition. Contemporary games can pump us full of adrenaline, they can make us laugh, but they have not yet provoked us to tears. And many have argued that, since games don't have characters of human complexity or stories that stress the consequences of our actions, they cannot achieve the status of true art.</p>
        <p>Here, we must be careful not to confuse the current transitional state of an emerging medium with its full potential. As I visit game companies, I see some of the industry's best minds struggling with this question and see strong evidence that the games released over the next few years will bring us closer and closer to the quality of characterization we have come to expect from other forms of popular narrative. . . .</p>
        <p>In the end, games may not take the same path as cinema. Game designers will almost certainly develop their own aesthetic principles as they confront the challenge of balancing our competing desires for storytelling and interactivity. It remains to be seen whether games can provide players the freedom they want and still provide an emotionally satisfying and thematically meaningful shape to the experience. Some of the best games -- Tetris comes to mind -- have nothing to do with storytelling. For all we know, the future art of games may look more like architecture or dance than cinema. . . .</p>
        <p>Early film critics played vital functions in documenting innovations and speculating about their potential. Computer games are in a similar phase. We have not had time to codify what experienced game designers know, and we have certainly not yet established a canon of great works that might serve as exemplars. There have been real creative accomplishments in games, but we haven't really sorted out what they are and why they matter. . . .</p>
        <p>The problem with most contemporary games isn't that they are violent but that they are banal, formulaic and predictable. . . . We should instead look at games as an emerging art form -- one that does not simply simulate violence but increasingly offers new ways to understand violence -- and talk about how to strike a balance between this form of expression and social responsibility.</p>
