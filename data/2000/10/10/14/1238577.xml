        <p>Delaware voters must choose between two of their favorite politicians, Republican Sen William V Roth Jr, whose 30 years in Senate gives him power in Congress, and Democratic Gov Thomas R Carper; photo (S)</p>

        <p>In this tiny state of 750,000 people, which takes pride in its moderate traditions and civil campaigns, voters seem truly torn over having to choose between two of their favorite politicians, now rivals in one of the nation's most hotly contested Senate races.</p>
        <p>At first glance, Senator William V. Roth Jr., chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, would appear to have a lock on the seat he first won 30 years ago and has easily defended since. But his opponent is the equally popular two-term Democratic governor and former congressman, Thomas R. Carper. Both candidates' approval ratings exceed 70 percent.</p>

        <p>In this tiny state of 750,000 people, which takes pride in its moderate traditions and civil campaigns, voters seem truly torn over having to choose between two of their favorite politicians, now rivals in one of the nation's most hotly contested Senate races.</p>
        <p>At first glance, Senator William V. Roth Jr., chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, would appear to have a lock on the seat he first won 30 years ago and has easily defended since. But his opponent is the equally popular two-term Democratic governor and former congressman, Thomas R. Carper. Both candidates' approval ratings exceed 70 percent.</p>
        <p>For Delawareans, this race turns largely on whether to re-elect Mr. Roth, 79, on the promise that his seniority can deliver political plums to his home state, or bet on Mr. Carper, 53, to bring new energy and a record as a consensus-building chief executive to the job. After trailing by more than 10 points early this year, Mr. Roth has fought back to draw even in a campaign that several recent polls rate as a tossup.</p>
        <p>Control of the Senate may be at stake, as Democratic strategists say Governor Carper must win to give his party any chance of erasing the Republicans' 54-to-46 majority in the Senate. ''It's a very volatile race with two masterful politicians going at it,'' said James R. Soles, a political science professor at the University of Delaware.</p>
        <p>With the candidates' only statewide televised debate this Sunday, Mr. Roth and Mr. Carper are honing their messages to sway uncommitted voters like Ken Singleton, a 46-year-old banker here who considers himself an independent. ''I'm a little undecided,'' said Mr. Singleton. ''Roth has a lot of tenure, and that's good for a small state like ours. But Carper represents the long term.''</p>
        <p>As chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Roth has considerable influence over Medicare, Social Security, foreign trade and tax policy. He is perhaps best known for the Kemp-Roth tax cut of 1981 and the tax-free savings accounts that bear his name. The senator's billboards here herald: ''Independent. Respected. A Leader for Delaware.''</p>
        <p>''I'm in a position because of my experience and background to do a lot on key issues like Medicare and getting prescription drugs at reasonable prices,'' Mr. Roth said. ''I'm respected on both sides of the aisle and I can get things done.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Roth doesn't mention is that under Senate Republican rules, he will have to give up the Finance Committee chairmanship in 2002. He said he could take over another panel after that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carper, who has never lost in 10 previous statewide races, has criticized Mr. Roth for squandering his influence and failing to deliver on top-priority issues like low-cost prescription drugs for the elderly, a major concern in a state where older people make up about 13 percent of the population. ''It's one thing to have seniority; it's another to use it effectively,'' Mr. Carper said.</p>
        <p>During his term, Governor Carper said, he has enacted laws to provide drug assistance to some low-income older residents, enforce new standards for teacher accountability in public schools and provide tax relief for married couples. Mr. Carper emphasized his ability to cross partisan lines to get things done, noting that he had worked with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, as well as Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, when he was in the House.</p>
        <p>Senator Roth dismisses criticism that he is part of what Democrats call a ''do-nothing'' Congress, arguing that election-year politics have torpedoed any chance for a major health care overhaul or significant tax relief. ''A lot of people recognize that we're in a very politically partisan campaign, and they don't anticipate much getting done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the past week or so, the campaign has turned negative, a departure from the usually genteel style of campaigning here. Both camps are broadcasting new radio commercials that criticize each other's records.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carper has tiptoed around raising Mr. Roth's age explicitly as an issue, but it is a subtext of much of his campaign. The governor's campaign billboards proclaim: ''Tom Carper. A Senator for Our Future.'' He runs six to seven miles a day.</p>
        <p>When asked about his opponent's debating style, Mr. Carper responded, ''He's fine as long as he's reading a script, but when it comes time to answer questions and respond off the cuff, it's more difficult.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth has raised nearly $4 million, more than double what Mr. Carper has raised, although the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has poured $2 million into the state since August to shore up the governor. The health care industry has run an estimated $1 million in commercials on behalf of Mr. Roth's campaign.</p>
        <p>Delaware, however, is a state where face to face politics count for a lot. With perhaps only 250,000 people expected to cast ballots here next month, voters expect a personal, almost intimate style of campaigning.</p>
        <p>In that respect, Mr. Carper, a tall, lean, native West Virginian, seems to have the advantage over Mr. Roth, a genial but reserved campaigner. At the 60th Annual Pulaski Day parade in a Polish-American neighborhood here, Mr. Carper walked the two-mile route, shaking hands, kissing babies, hugging elderly women.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Roth rode in the back of a white Mustang with one of his St. Bernards, waving to the crowd. His huge dogs have been fixtures in his campaigns for years, attracting curious children and, more important, their ballot-punching parents.</p>
        <p>Along the parade route, the debate over experience versus youth raged. ''I like Roth's seniority and I like Carper's youth, but I've got to go with the seniority,'' said Gary Moderhak, a 49-year-old Realtor who is a Republican.</p>
        <p>But Catherine Grzybowski, a 71-year-old clerk who is a Democrat, said, ''Roth is a good man, but I think he's getting a little old for this.''</p>
        <p>With Election Day a month away, Mr. Carper crisscrosses the state on a packed schedule that often starts with shaking hands at factory gates at 5:30 a.m. and ends with his working bowling leagues at night. Mr. Roth's committee work has kept him tethered to Washington, giving his rival an advantage as long as Congress continues to struggle to wrap up its year-end budget bills.</p>
        <p>''Getting around and being seen is very important,'' Mr. Roth said. ''One of the handicaps I have is that I'm in Washington, and my opponent is here campaigning full time.''</p>
