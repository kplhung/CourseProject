        <p>Move over Jorge Luis Borges. Here comes Diego Maradona.</p>
        <p>The world's most acclaimed soccer player of the 1980's and early 1990's, whose cocaine use and run-ins with the law have made him a living soap opera, has published his memoirs. And after two weeks the book, ''I Am Diego,'' appears to be on its way to becoming the biggest best-seller in Argentine history.</p>
        <p>In its first week the book sold 220,000 copies of a record-breaking first edition printing of 350,000. Working-class people who have not bought a book in years are lining up at kiosks and supermarket counters to pay $15, not a small sum in the middle of the deepest recession here in more than a decade. And there are plans to have the book translated into 30 languages for eventual publication in 80 countries.</p>
        <p>The book begins with three pages of dedications to an array of personalities, famous and not so famous, including Fidel Castro, Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan and God.</p>
        <p>''I have finally decided to tell all,'' Maradona begins in his folksy style, full of earthy Argentine idiomatic expressions not often heard in tea parlors or found between book jackets. Describing himself smoking a pungent Cuban cigar as he recounts his life while recovering in Havana from cocaine addiction, he continues: ''I don't know, but it always seems to me that there remain things to say. How strange!''</p>
        <p>What follows are 319 pages of reflections of the man whose bewitching head fakes, masterful dribbling and powerful left foot were the terror of every goalie in international soccer for nearly two decades.</p>
        <p>But Maradona does not actually tell all. He only touches lightly on his drug and legal problems, and virtually nothing is said about his sometimes violent run-ins with photographers or the shady connections of some of his associates that have elicited several criminal investigations across international borders.</p>
        <p>The book's phenomenal early sales success has spawned several magazine cover stories, one depicting Maradona flexing his biceps to show off a tattooed face of Che Guevara.</p>
        <p>His book's defense of Mr. Castro has raised eyebrows. And his criticism of the Roman Catholic Church has scandalized some. ''I went to the Vatican and I saw all those ceilings of gold,'' he wrote. ''Then I heard the pope say that the church was concerned about the poor. So sell the roof -- do something!''</p>
        <p>Maradona briefly returned home from Cuba to unveil the book two weeks ago at a boisterous news conference attended by several hundred people at a new five-star Buenos Aires hotel.</p>
        <p>''What I wanted to do,'' Maradona explained to reporters and fans, ''was show that I am the Diego of the people.''</p>
        <p>But for all the publicity, the book has not been deemed worthy of review or commentary by the critics. Claudio Ivan Remeseira, an Argentine essayist, said the country's intelligentsia was once again displaying its snobbery, ''including the progressive intellectuals who say they speak for the people.''</p>
        <p>''This is another instance of the polarization between the Argentine cultural world and popular sensibilities,'' Mr. Remeseira said.</p>
        <p>Maradona's story, as told to two Argentine writers, begins in the working-class barrio of Villa Fiorito, where Maradona lived with his eight brothers and sisters in a leaky shack,  where summers were unbearably hot and winters unbearably cold. There were many hungry nights, and life was a struggle. But Maradona early on found peace and control when kicking a ball around the dirt patio.</p>
        <p>At 16 he was the youngest player ever to suit up for the star-speckled Argentine national team. Thirteen years later, he had acquired a fortune so grand that he had a $1 million wedding, complete with a charter Boeing 747 to deliver his guests.</p>
        <p>The book is a straightforward narrative describing Maradona's many triumphs on the field, and his description of what has become the most infamous goal ever scored in World Cup competition may well go down as the best line of the book.</p>
        <p>It was the quarterfinal against England in the 1986 World Cup -- the first match between the two national teams since the war over the Falkland Islands in 1982 -- when Maradona broke a scoreless tie with a leaping head shot beyond the reach of the English goalie.</p>
        <p>Replays showed later that Maradona's hand had touched the ball, and the goal should have been disallowed. Argentines have ever since called the most famous goal in Argentine soccer history as ''the hand of God,'' a sublime if not entirely sporting moment when Argentina got its sweet revenge for the Falklands disaster.</p>
        <p>''Now, yes, I can say what I could not say before,'' Maradona confesses in his memoir. ''What hand of God? It was the hand of Diego!''</p>
