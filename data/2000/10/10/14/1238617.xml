        <p>The Palestinian mission at the United Nations, faced with an American vow to veto any Security Council resolution on the fighting between Israel and the Palestinians, may seek a special General Assembly session to condemn the Israelis, diplomats said today.</p>
        <p>General Assembly resolutions cannot be vetoed. In the past, Palestinians have been able to muster large majorities there for condemnations of Israel, though assembly resolutions carry no enforcement powers.</p>
        <p>The Nonaligned Movement, still a numerical force at the United Nations, also discussed strategy today, and some diplomats said that there were renewed calls also for Security Council action despite the American threat.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations, announced that the United States, which abstained on a resolution in the Security Council last weekend broadly criticizing the renewal of fighting, would veto any further Security Council measures on this issue.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Holbrooke said that the decision to veto any further resolutions came from President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration came under criticism from across the political spectrum for abstaining, and not vetoing, the resolution last week. Even Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for the Senate from New York, broke ranks with her husband's administration over the vote.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Holbrooke met with several Arab diplomats, including the head of the Palestinian observer mission to the United Nations, Nasser al-Kidwa, to discuss what role the United Nations should play.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke said after his meetings that the determination of the Palestinians and their supporters, led by Malaysia, to force the crisis back into the Security Council was a throwback to days many diplomats thought had passed. Israel's position has improved substantially at the United Nations since the cold war's end.</p>
        <p>''What you see here in the emotions of the current crisis is some countries trying to bring the U.N. back to its low point, passing resolutions on Zionism that were racist,'' Mr. Holbrooke said.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has generally tried to keep all matters involving Israel or peace moves in the Middle East out of the Security Council. Since the end of the cold war, the Mideast has been virtually the only issue on which the United States has been consistently willing to use its veto.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan has become deeply involved in shuttle diplomacy in Jerusalem and Gaza over the last week. Mr. Holbrooke said that the secretary general's efforts, however, were welcome.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, who has had several meetings with Mr. Arafat, said today that the Palestinian leader ''is as determined as all of us to end the chaos, stop the killing and save the people from further suffering.''</p>
