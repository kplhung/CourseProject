        <p>Thousands of Muslims closed shops, left homes and skipped classes yesterday to rail against Israeli violence and to pledge support for  Palestinians during a protest march that brought the tensions of the Middle East to the East Side of Manhattan. Chants of outrage cut the autumn afternoon air until the rally ended in prayers to Allah, just yards from the United Nations complex.</p>
        <p>Small boys marched with faces painted black, red, green and white, the colors of the Palestinian flag. Women in head scarves waved enlarged photographs of Palestinian children killed in the recent violence in the Middle East. Men went hoarse demanding that American aid to Israel be cut off. Everywhere, signs likened Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel to Hitler.</p>
        <p>The protest by an estimated 15,000 people -- a much lower turnout than what organizers had predicted -- presented a counterpoint to a rally outside the Israeli Consulate in Midtown Manhattan on Thursday, when about 15,000 people decried Palestinian violence and shouted the praises of Israel. For every reference made then to the jarring image of an Israeli soldier's body being tossed from a window in Ramallah, in the West Bank, there was a reference yesterday to the image of a Palestinian boy dying in his father's arms, the victim of Israeli gunfire two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Aside from the opposing interpretations of the violence, one other element distinguished yesterday's rally from Thursday's. The prominent politicians who showed up to pledge their support to Israel on Thursday -- Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senate candidates Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- were nowhere to be found yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ahmad Al-Khatib, a representative of the National Muslim Merchants Association and a rally organizer, said invitations had been extended to all four politicians, but each had declined -- for fear, he said, of offending Jewish interests.</p>
        <p>''They think the Jewish bloc is the only vote,'' he said. ''We have 1.25 million in New York State. And we vote.''</p>
        <p>To Muhammad Abassi, another organizer, the rally's purpose was clear. ''If our brothers and sisters over there cannot express themselves,'' he said, ''that puts a moral obligation on our community, on all Muslims in the United States, to use the freedom of speech that we have here to speak for them.''</p>
        <p>The organizers said plans for yesterday's rally developed two weeks ago, when a visit by the Israeli right-wing leader Ariel Sharon to the ancient mosques in the contested center of Jerusalem's Old City sparked violent scuffles.</p>
        <p>It was only a coincidence, they said, that yesterday's rally immediately followed dramatic developments in the Middle East on Thursday, from the killing of two Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian mob to the retaliatory rocketing of Palestinian neighborhoods by Israeli forces.</p>
        <p>Word of the rally had been spread at more than 150 mosques in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, organizers said. Yesterday morning, they came in droves, pouring out of Grand Central Terminal with chants of ''Shame, Shame, U.S.A.'' and ''No Justice, No Peace.''</p>
        <p>But there had been some preparation. Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, closed its offices on 42nd Street for the day, and hundreds of police officers were in position by early morning, leaning against crowd control barriers.</p>
        <p>Six teenage boys from Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, hopped off the B train and hurried up Third Avenue to join the crowd assembling a block away, on Second Avenue. One carried a Palestinian flag he had bought for $28 a couple of weeks ago; several others wore beaded Palestinian flags around their necks. All said they were born in the United States.</p>
        <p>Using the language of the schoolyard, they struggled with the enormity of the violence. ''They throw bombs at us just because we killed two or three Jews,'' said Alaelddin Aljibawi, 15. ''They've killed hundreds.''</p>
        <p>The teenagers said they had their parents' permission to skip school and attend the rally.</p>
        <p>On Second Avenue, from 42nd Street to 45th Street, thousands of marchers gathered. Their posters bobbed in the sunlight; one said the Star of David was the equivalent of the swastika. Shortly before 1 p.m., the protesters and their police escorts turned onto 42nd Street, then turned north on Third Avenue, where the police had set aside the two easternmost lanes for the rally.</p>
        <p>Once the first marchers reached Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, the women were directed to the right and the men to the left, so that the sexes would be separated for the Friday afternoon prayer service. But first, a handful of speakers addressed the crowd, condemning Israel, excoriating American politicians for failing to understand the suffering of Palestinians, and urging Muslims everywhere to stand up and be heard.</p>
        <p>Then thousands of Muslims -- enough to fill the plaza from First Avenue to Second Avenue -- set aside their posters. They knelt on mats, with many removing their shoes. Facing east, they began to pray.</p>
