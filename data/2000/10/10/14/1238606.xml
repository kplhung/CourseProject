        <p>In the end, all the anticipation that had been mounting in the days before Tom Ford's first show tonight for Yves Saint Laurent ran out like the wind in a balloon. The collection was good, not great, but more important, Mr. Ford found a way through the dense vocabulary of Saint Laurent to say his own thing.</p>
        <p>That is no small feat. Among the guests arriving for the twilight show, at the Rodin Museum, were Loulou Klossowski and Anne-Marie Munoz, who have worked with Mr. Saint Laurent for years, and Betty Catroux, a friend of the designer's since the 1960's.</p>

        <p>In the end, all the anticipation that had been mounting in the days before Tom Ford's first show tonight for Yves Saint Laurent ran out like the wind in a balloon. The collection was good, not great, but more important, Mr. Ford found a way through the dense vocabulary of Saint Laurent to say his own thing.</p>
        <p>That is no small feat. Among the guests arriving for the twilight show, at the Rodin Museum, were Loulou Klossowski and Anne-Marie Munoz, who have worked with Mr. Saint Laurent for years, and Betty Catroux, a friend of the designer's since the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Pierre Berge, Mr. Saint Laurent's partner of 40 years, was there, too. And so were Sonia Rykiel and Richard Avedon. Mr. Saint Laurent himself was not there. Last week he flew to Morocco, where he has homes in Tangier and Marrakesh.</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Ford, who is also creative director of Gucci, which acquired the French house last year in a $968 million sale, was in the unenviable position of pleasing many. And what he wisely chose to do was please young, world-weary women whose idea of Saint Laurent is not a safari jacket and thigh-high boots, the epitome of 70's cool, but rather a new thing -- a slouchy white tuxedo with wide, cuffed trousers and a tight top scooped low enough to suggest a cummerbund.</p>
        <p>The only spots of color in the all-black-and-white spring collection were metallic wedge sandals in electric yellow or pink, and the deep purple irises held by black cords at the models' throats.</p>
        <p>Nothing gave a better idea of how carefully Mr. Ford had thought out each detail, especially in relation to Saint Laurent, than the virtual absence of accessories. No hats, no gloves, no handbags. Only a small, hard purse that looked like a cross between a camera and a cigarette case. And yet, as if to summon some of that familiar sense of sin and savoir-faire, Mr. Ford had the models wear sheer black stockings and, apparently, garter belts.</p>
        <p>By avoiding color, Mr. Ford not only removed the most obvious point of comparison to Mr. Saint Laurent, he also gave himself a blank slate on which to propose a different proportion. Trousers were cut loose through the hips and legs, and there were sporty styles in denim that brought to mind painter's pants.</p>
        <p>Jackets were fuller through the shoulders, though an attempt to twist the Saint Laurent formula, with sleeves that peaked eccentrically above shoulders, resulted only in making them look like Belgian pommes frites cones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford assiduously avoided obvious Saint Laurent references, like bowed blouses, while cleverly incorporating others. Those wide swaths of ruching that cinched the waists of jackets and crepe dresses looked cool, but it wasn't a new idea. Saint Laurent did it in the mid-80's.</p>
        <p>Comments were generally favorable.</p>
        <p>''It's not the poetry of Yves,'' Ms. Rykiel said. ''It's much more strong and direct.'' Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's, called the collection ''tough chic in a good way,'' adding that he couldn't help thinking a little sadly of Mr. Saint Laurent. ''This is his life, repackaged for the millennium,'' Mr. Ruttenstein said. ''Tom did what he had to do.''</p>
        <p>Another retailer faulted the clothes for being ''slick -- and 'slick' is not what you'd call Y.S.L.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berge said only, ''It's not my place to comment.''</p>
        <p>So, the bubble is finally burst. But Mr. Ford could not have chosen a more competitive moment to revive an aging brand.</p>
        <p>With John Galliano and Hedi Slimane both at Dior, and Alexander McQueen and Marc Jacobs consistently making news for Givenchy and Louis Vuitton respectively, and new, younger people like Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga transforming fashion, Paris is the story.</p>
        <p>Milan may have Prada, Gucci and Armani, but it doesn't have, and may never have, what Paris has. Which is the capacity to recognize and then adore real talent.</p>
        <p>In a show of exceptional simplicity marked by elements of grandeur, Mr. Ghesquiere demonstrated again why he is fashion's current darling. He has a look that sets him apart, a way of cutting pants and manipulating proportion so that his clothes look right, yet are slightly off. He has freely taken from others, mostly Cristobal Balenciaga and sometimes Giorgio di Sant'Angelo, but unlike many designers who walk with a broom behind themselves, erasing their tracks, Mr. Ghesquiere treads but lightly and walks with a feather.</p>
        <p>He doesn't mind that you know, for instance, that the passage of white dresses that closed his show on Thursday were inspired by wedding dresses that Balenciaga made for special clients, especially late in his career. Yet, for Mr. Ghesquiere, the idea was just to find a way into a contemporary story about formality.</p>
        <p>The dresses he designed were in white cotton jersey, often with fraying garlands of lace or tulle around the side, or with a yoke of seed pearls. But, essentially, the shape of the dresses was that of a slip or a T-shirt.</p>
        <p>And now that Mr. Ghesquiere's signature slim trousers are being widely copied, he has given them a slightly different look, with tough-looking buckles on the pocket and more ease.</p>
        <p>At an age when most designers are resting on their laurels, Karl Lagerfeld is once again revving up his own label.</p>
        <p>His show today, the last day of the spring 2001 collections, deftly combined those fuller skirts that Mr. Lagerfeld likes (fresh in black Shantung pleats or soft tiers of white cotton) with sharp leather or a lurid purple blouse in a dizzying circle print glossed with paillettes.</p>
        <p>After four solid weeks of shows, could the fashion crowd really absorb the central dig of John Galliano's farce? Did they guess that by playing that dippy Britney Spears song, Mr. Galliano was saying of himself, ''Oops, I've done it again''? Judging by the nonplused looks, probably not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galliano had the idea, borrowed from Picasso, of showing how clothes he designed for Dior could morph into his own style. Well, the notion of breaking down the past and reassembling it didn't work as well for Mr. Galliano as it did for Picasso.</p>
        <p>But it's not every day that you get to see fashion's obsession with imaging and packaging -- not to mention timely deliveries -- expressed in a newsprint dress bound with shipping tape.</p>
