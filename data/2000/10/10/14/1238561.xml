        <p>In ways that could not have been anticipated when the repertory was chosen months ago, Leonard Bernstein nearly showed up for the New York Philharmonic subscription series commemorating the 10th anniversary of his death today: Bernstein the blustering, bullying humanist taking all suffering personally, as well as composer. Although the carefully regulated dose of his music, the ''Jeremiah'' Symphony, is dispensed quickly at the start of the program, it proved singularly appropriate at the first performance, on Thursday, after the loss of Israeli, Palestinian and American lives in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''All her friends have dealt treacherously with her,'' Rinat Shaham, an Israeli mezzo-soprano, sang of Jerusalem in Hebrew in the concluding ''Lamentation.'' ''They are become her enemies.'' But except, perhaps, for the intensity of Ms. Shaham's delivery, it was as though nothing had happened during the day.</p>

        <p>In ways that could not have been anticipated when the repertory was chosen months ago, Leonard Bernstein nearly showed up for the New York Philharmonic subscription series commemorating the 10th anniversary of his death today: Bernstein the blustering, bullying humanist taking all suffering personally, as well as composer. Although the carefully regulated dose of his music, the ''Jeremiah'' Symphony, is dispensed quickly at the start of the program, it proved singularly appropriate at the first performance, on Thursday, after the loss of Israeli, Palestinian and American lives in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''All her friends have dealt treacherously with her,'' Rinat Shaham, an Israeli mezzo-soprano, sang of Jerusalem in Hebrew in the concluding ''Lamentation.'' ''They are become her enemies.'' But except, perhaps, for the intensity of Ms. Shaham's delivery, it was as though nothing had happened during the day.</p>
        <p>You could almost hear the patented homily Bernstein would have drawled beforehand. (''I have to tell you that I, for one, do not feel much like celebrating tonight. . . .'') And you had to be grateful that Leonard Slatkin, the conductor here, did not feel compelled to stand in.</p>
        <p>Still, some sort of grand Bernsteinian gesture was needed to complete the tribute and make the big-hearted composer present in the hall, to say nothing of simply connecting with the real world. To move the piece to the end of the program, giving the work greater prominence and the performance greater point, might have been logistically impossible.</p>
        <p>But why not request that the audience withhold applause in recognition of the day's events, making the occasion meaningful and memorable for listeners and performers? Must what happens in the concert hall be so remote from pressing human concerns?</p>
        <p>If so, you can see why classical music finds itself mired in crisis. And you have to wonder whether it would have any use for another Bernstein even if one came along.</p>
        <p>The rest of the program is, in any case, essentially escapist and unrelated to Bernstein. As expected, Mitsuko Uchida gave a probing, elegant and sparkling account of Mendelssohn's G minor Piano Concerto.</p>
        <p>Yet here, too, a surreal sort of disconnectedness intruded for listeners in my area, when a patron fainted. Through no fault of the conductor and soloist, who were both facing away and rightly preoccupied, the band played on in eerie counterpoint as a doctor and others attended to the woman for two of the three movements.</p>
        <p>Dvorak's Eighth Symphony was uneventful and, it seemed after a bizarre day and evening, unimportant. Perhaps it will appear more so when the program is repeated tonight and on Tuesday at Avery Fisher Hall.</p>
