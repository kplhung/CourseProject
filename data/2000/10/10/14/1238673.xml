        <p>Even as he continued to voice support for the Clinton administration's approach to the Middle East, Gov. George W.

        <p>Even as he continued to voice support for the Clinton administration's approach to the Middle East, Gov. George W. Bush, along with his running mate, Dick Cheney, found ways today to frame the crisis there as an argument for their ticket and a validation for Mr. Bush's proposals on energy and the military.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush used the developments abroad to bolster his call for the United States to become less dependent on foreign oil, making particular reference to growing imports from Iraq during the Clinton years and to the decision several weeks ago to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney addressed the situation more broadly, saying the attack on the destroyer Cole on Thursday  illustrated the importance of maintaining military strength.</p>
        <p>''We are a democracy defended by volunteers,'' Mr. Cheney said at an airport rally in Wisconsin. ''Everybody serving on the Cole was a volunteer, voluntarily putting on the uniform to serve in the U.S. military. And that places a special obligation on us, on we civilians, to make certain they have the resources they need to do the job we ask them to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, a defense secretary under Mr. Bush's father, said he did not mean to imply that any lack of military preparedness contributed to the attack on the Cole, though he did question whether better gathering of intelligence could have prevented it.</p>
        <p>But his comments echoed statements he and Mr. Bush have repeatedly made, asserting that the Clinton administration had allowed the military to deteriorate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, in a speech to automotive designers and engineers here today, used the prism of the Middle East to revisit and disparage Vice President Al Gore's recommendation to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. President Clinton subsequently took that step, intended largely to keep rising fuel prices under control as winter approached.</p>
        <p>''The strategic reserve is meant for times of war or a major disruption in oil supplies,'' the Texas governor told a crowd of hundreds in an enormous atrium at a General Motors office building here.</p>
        <p>''Every barrel released today,'' he said, ''is one less barrel available to protect us against threats to our security, threats that are becoming more vivid with the week's turmoil and violence in the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>With their remarks, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney showed that they were prepared to make events in the Middle East a part of the campaign debate, although it was a course that they were pursuing with obvious caution, lest they be accused of using a tragedy to score political points.</p>
        <p>Thus far, Mr. Bush has not questioned the administration's diplomatic efforts, saying that the United States must ''speak with one voice'' at times like this. And he has weighed in only vaguely about the correct response to the terrorist attack on the Cole, saying there ''must be a consequence.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cheney was more specific today in remarks after a speech at a  center for the elderly near Madison, Wis.</p>
        <p>''Any would-be terrorist out there needs to know that if you're going to attack, you'll be hit very hard and very quick,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''It's not time for diplomacy and debate. It's time for action.''</p>
        <p>The crisis in the Middle East has afforded Mr. Gore an opportunity, which he has seized, to emphasize his role as a statesman and, at least implicitly, highlight his greater experience in international affairs.</p>
        <p>But the Bush campaign would like to turn the situation to its own advantage, a fact made clear in Mr. Bush's speech today and in his aides' reaction to an article in The New York Times about a secret agreement between Mr. Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister. The article said the agreement called for an end to all Russian sales of conventional weapons to Iran by the end of 1999, but the deadline passed and the transfer of weapons continued.</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, the campaign's communications director, pointedly used the words ''Middle East'' and ''terrorism'' in her response to the article's disclosures. ''This is one of the most damaging things that could have happened to the security of the United States and the security of our allies, especially in the Middle East,'' Ms. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>''Iran is a major source of terrorism in the Middle East,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, in his speech today, asserted that ''on the Clinton-Gore watch, Saddam Hussein's Iraq has become a major supplier of oil to America''</p>
        <p>''The current crisis in the Middle East,'' he said, ''underscores the danger of American reliance on Saddam Hussein's oil.''</p>
        <p>Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, said that in 1999, Iraq supplied only 8 percent of the oil imported to this country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that Mr. Gore and the Clinton administration had not only erred in releasing oil from the petroleum reserve but had also mismanaged its distribution.</p>
        <p>He was referring to an acknowledgement earlier this week by Energy Department officials that they knew virtually nothing about three small companies that successfully bid for a third of the oil. One operated out of a New York City apartment, another was incorporated less than two months ago and all had trouble obtaining financial backing to complete the deals.</p>
        <p>''Vice President Gore called for this release and he should take responsibility for what has occurred,'' Mr. Bush said. ''If this is the best the administration can do, it is time for a new administration.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Spell said that the Republican ticket had little credibility on the issue of oil prices because of its close ties to the oil industry and, in particular, Mr. Cheney's former position as chief executive of the Halliburton Company, the world's largest provider of oil field services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has been emphasizing the issues of oil and military might for much of the campaign. On Wednesday, the day before the Cole was attacked, Mr. Cheney went to Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., where Winston Churchill gave his ''Iron Curtain'' speech in 1946, to warn that the country must continue to spend significant resources on a strong military even though the cold war is over, because it is an unstable and dangerous world.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Cheney returned to the theme. ''If we needed a reminder of the cost of military service, of the fact that every time somebody puts on a uniform for us and goes out and defends our freedom, that they put their lives at risk, all you have to do today is think about the sailors we lost yesterday on the U.S.S. Cole,'' he said. ''It's still a very dangerous world out there.''</p>
