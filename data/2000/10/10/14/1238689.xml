        <p>Intensive efforts to convene an emergency summit meeting of Israeli, Palestinian, American and Egyptian leaders ended without success early today, with the Palestinians continuing to insist that Israel must first lift its ''siege.''</p>
        <p>The efforts by Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations, President Clinton and other foreign leaders to set up a meeting in an effort to break 16 days of violence had intensified on Friday, the day after a Palestinian mob in Ramallah killed two Israeli soldiers, and Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes in Ramallah and Gaza.</p>
        <p>In a phone call from the White House on Friday night to a Democratic fund-raising gathering in Arkansas, President Clinton said he was working hard to restore calm. ''We may get a breakthrough sometime in the next several hours,'' he said. ''We're working hard trying to turn this thing around.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was said to be ready to leave on Sunday for the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik for a meeting there on Monday. Officials said the president phoned the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Morocco and asked them to use their influence with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to persuade him to attend.</p>
        <p>The Arab leaders, regarded as moderate, were said to be eager for a meeting.</p>
        <p>But Nabil Aburdeineh, a senior adviser to the Palestinian leader, said late Friday that Mr. Arafat would not attend any talks until the Israelis lifted a blockade of Palestinian areas in the West Bank and Gaza that was imposed after Thursday's incident in Ramallah.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aburdeineh also reiterated Mr. Arafat's condition that Israel  must pull back its troops and armor and that an international fact-finding commission must be set up to determine the causes of the violence.</p>
        <p>''It is too early to talk about convening a summit,'' Mr. Aburdeineh said. ''No precise date has been set. The Israeli aggression must stop before we can talk about other issues.''</p>
        <p>But Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel said on television that he would not agree to conditions for attending a summit meeting. ''We are not ready to pave the way there with prizes for violence,'' he said. ''There can be no reward for violence.''</p>
        <p>In his invitation to the summit meeting to the two protagonists, the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, said he wanted the Israeli military operations to stop before the meeting opened, but he did not make specific conditions. The Egyptians insisted, however, that it was difficult for Mr. Arafat, who has had no direct contact with Mr. Barak this week, to negotiate at a summit meeting under the barrel of a gun.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, who flew by helicopter to see Mr. Arafat in his compound in Gaza, said on Friday evening that he still hoped to get a positive response from Mr. Arafat. ''The minimum needed is a cessation of hostilities and a cease-fire before we go to the table to talk,'' Mr. Annan said.</p>
        <p>The secretary general said he had received assurances from Mr. Barak that medical supplies would be permitted into Palestinian areas, and he said he would raise the issue of food with the Israeli prime minister.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials contended  that a cease-fire, given the close proximity of Israeli troops to Palestinian towns, was meaningless, and that previous cease-fires had swiftly broken down.</p>
        <p>''We are not going to a summit unless it produces something,'' said a spokesman for Mr. Arafat, Marwan Kanafani. ''The lifting of the siege must be part of the package or the summit will not happen. We will only go to a summit to talk about real issues, to move the peace process forward. President Arafat cannot leave the country while it is under siege and while Israeli soldiers are deployed as they have been for the last 15 days.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanafani said he still held out a slim hope that the Israelis would agree to the Palestinian demands.</p>
        <p>''Usually at the last moment someone comes up with an idea,'' he said, ''but if the siege is not lifted it is only an indication that we will not have a fruitful or successful summit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat promised to carry out a ''very serious investigation'' into the killings of Israeli soldiers in Ramallah. But tensions remained high throughout the West Bank and Gaza, as in Israel.</p>
        <p>In Jerusalem, the Israeli police blocked thousands of Palestinians from attending Friday Prayers in the Old City, preventing another explosion of violence there, but angering the Muslims.</p>
        <p>One fatality was reported, a Palestinian who was killed in clashes with Israeli troops in Hebron.</p>
        <p>At least 98 people, all but 7 of them Palestinians or Israeli Arabs, have been killed since the unrest began. As many as 3,000 people have been wounded.</p>
        <p>Here in Gaza, the militant Islamic movement Hamas led tens of thousands of angry Palestinians through the city following Friday Prayers. Many chanted ''Bomb Tel Aviv!'' The crowd looted and burned a hotel, shops and a home where some people said alcohol was sold. Islam prohibits the use of alcohol.</p>
        <p>Palestinian police officers watched but did not intervene.</p>
        <p>Similar marches were reported in Ramallah, Hebron and elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Senators Support Israel</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (Reuters)</p>
        <p>Dozens of senators urged President Clinton today to voice the United States' support for Israel and to condemn Palestinian violence, saying it may be the best way to help restore the Middle East peace effort.</p>
        <p>''We are deeply concerned at the continuing, coordinated campaign of Palestinian violence,'' the senators wrote in a letter to Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''That campaign leads us to believe that Arafat either seeks to use violence as a negotiating tool to extort even further concessions from the government of Israel, or that he in fact intends to end the peace process in its entirety as a prelude to unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood,'' they added.</p>
        <p>The letter was signed by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, and the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, and about 70 other senators.</p>
