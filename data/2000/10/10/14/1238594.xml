        <p>Football players and coaches never admit to looking past a coming opponent. The reality is that every team is aware that a 16-game schedule has its perilous stages and its periods of opportunity. The focus may be week to week; the understanding is that success is measured in groups of games.</p>
        <p>The Giants, for all their inconsistencies, have survived a precarious opening phase of the season with a  4-2 record. And now they are staring at a chance to gain a formidable edge in the hunt for a playoff spot. Beginning with the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday at Giants Stadium, no team the Giants will face in the next four weeks currently has a winning record. If the Giants can defeat teams they are generally expected to beat, they will be in position to make the playoffs.</p>
        <p>It is also true that a failure to pad their victory total in the next month will most likely doom the Giants' playoff chances.</p>
        <p>After playing host to the Cowboys, the Giants have a bye week and then another home game against Philadelphia. On Nov. 4, they travel to Cleveland to play the Browns.</p>
        <p>The Giants could be favored in each of those games. Should they win all of them, they would have a 7-2 record and then even a 3-4 finish would probably earn them a playoff spot. Two victories in the next three games would give the Giants a 6-3 record and a solid chance at a postseason berth. They will have potentially difficult games remaining -- St. Louis at home and Washington, Arizona and Dallas on the road -- but they will also play Detroit, Pittsburgh and Jacksonville in Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Much of the season has to play out, with any number of possibilities. But the Giants have already played half their road games this season and are two games over .500, a result as good as anyone in the organization reasonably anticipated.</p>
        <p>What the Giants did not do in the last two seasons was win the games they were expected to win. It is the main reason the Giants have not had a winning season since 1997, when they were 6-2 at home and were not upset in any road game.</p>
        <p>If the Giants are going to be better this season, it will most likely manifest itself in the games they are, on paper at least, supposed to win. The chance to show that improvement may never be more obvious than in the next four weeks.</p>
        <p>Daluiso Back in Action</p>
        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel announced today that Brad Daluiso would be doing the place-kicking against Dallas instead of Jaret Holmes, who filled in for Daluiso last week at Atlanta. Daluiso, who also had reconstructive knee surgery last year, missed the Atlanta game because of a back injury.</p>
        <p>Holmes, who has a strong leg and made each of the three field goals he attempted against the Falcons, will remain on the Giants' roster as insurance against Daluiso's aggravating his injuries.</p>
        <p>Fassel indicated that Daluiso's experience with the Giants the last eight years influenced his thinking in choosing between the two kickers.</p>
        <p>''It was close, but I'm going with Brad this week,'' Fassel said of Daluiso, who has made four of seven field-goal attempts this season. ''Things could change as the weeks go on.''</p>
        <p>Sparks May Be a Target</p>
        <p>The Giants ignored Phillippi Sparks last winter when the cornerback became a free agent after eight years with the team. Sparks's relationship with his defensive teammates reached its lowest point late last season after he had missed several games with a hamstring injury.</p>
        <p>Sparks had not been on the best of terms for a few seasons, especially after his ill-timed, on-field argument with some teammates late in the Giants' playoff loss to Minnesota in 1997.</p>
        <p>On Sunday Sparks returns to Giants Stadium as the Cowboys' starting left cornerback. Few Giants were willing to say the team plans to make a target of Sparks -- the running game may be more of a priority --  but expect the Giants to at least attempt to unnerve the emotional cornerback.</p>
        <p>''If we keep catching first-down passes on him,'' said Giants wide receiver Amani Toomer, who was matched against Sparks in practice for four seasons, ''we won't have to say anything to him to upset him.''</p>
