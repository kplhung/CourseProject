      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Al Hirschfeld, the caricaturist famous for his witty portraits of stage and screen stars, has dropped a lawsuit against Margo Feiden, the gallery owner who for 30 years had exclusive rights to the sale of his work.</p>
        <p>Instead of going to court, the two longtime partners have signed another contract that gives Ms. Feiden and her Madison Avenue gallery the rights to sell and license Mr. Hirschfeld's drawings, while Mr. Hirschfeld, now 97, will control the exhibition of his work in museums.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued yesterday, Mr. Hirschfeld said he was ''gratified to be continuing my longstanding business relationship with the Margo Feiden Galleries, whose integrity and devotion in handling my work across the years has been most rewarding.''</p>
        <p>In his suit, filed in May in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Hirschfeld accused Ms. Feiden of refusing to give him access to his own artwork and of seeking to prevent an exhibition of his drawings in 1997 at a museum in Katonah, N.Y.  -- which took place -- and another that had been scheduled at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld was not available for further comment, and his lawyers declined to speak to reporters. The statement said that both sides had withdrawn their claims against each other.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feiden, who has been Mr. Hirschfeld's exclusive dealer since 1974, said that the old relationship was off to a new start. ''My interest is in repairing the relationship, my interest is that there be a big sign saying 'Business as usual,' '' said Ms. Feiden. She said that the new contract with Mr. Hirschfeld was ''very much the same'' as the previous one.</p>
        <p>The dispute arose after David Leopold, a former employee at Ms. Feiden's gallery, acted as curator of an exhibition of Mr. Hirschfeld's work at the Katonah Museum of Art in Westchester County. Ms. Feiden contended that he did so without her consent, even though he made use of her client files, telephone and fax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld's original suit, which bristled with accusations and charges of ''harassment'' by Ms. Feiden, , sought an injunction against further sales by the Feiden Galleries and damages in excess of $5 million as well as punitive damages. Mr. Hirschfeld had also sought the return of artworks consigned to the Margo Feiden Galleries, said to number  1,000 to 1,200.</p>
