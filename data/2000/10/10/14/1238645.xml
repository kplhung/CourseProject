        <p>As the state panel overseeing Nassau County's fiscal crisis voted today to refinance a chunk of the county's mammoth debt, Republican and Democratic legislators seemed more inclined to quibble over property taxes: how high to raise them when they pass a budget next week.</p>
        <p>The panel, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, will sell up to $270 million worth of municipal bonds -- at a credit rating above the costly near-junk status the county is assigned -- to provide $42 million worth of fiscal relief this year, officials said. The county is seeking another $88 million in relief next year.</p>

        <p>As the state panel overseeing Nassau County's fiscal crisis voted today to refinance a chunk of the county's mammoth debt, Republican and Democratic legislators seemed more inclined to quibble over property taxes: how high to raise them when they pass a budget next week.</p>
        <p>The panel, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, will sell up to $270 million worth of municipal bonds -- at a credit rating above the costly near-junk status the county is assigned -- to provide $42 million worth of fiscal relief this year, officials said. The county is seeking another $88 million in relief next year.</p>
        <p>But those refinancing savings are just one part of the county's financial recovery plan to plug a nearly $380 million budget deficit estimated for 2004, and to stave off a state takeover of the county's fiscal operations. The  plan also includes layoffs, deep service cuts and tax increases.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said the focus of the discussion was ''after all the cuts are done, after all the consolidations are completed, how much of a tax increase is needed to right the wrongs that exist?''</p>
        <p>Already, Thomas S. Gulotta, the county executive, has proposed a nearly 4 percent increase in property taxes for 2001. But the authority has rejected his budget plan because it counts on $81.7 million in spending cuts or revenues that, for one reason or another, may not materialize.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said a double-digit property tax increase might be needed next year, primarily because the county's deficit unexpectedly grew by more than $60 million in early September. If not for that, she said, the county could have solved its fiscal crisis without a tax increase, as Gov. George E. Pataki suggested when he announced a state bailout of the otherwise wealthy county in May.</p>
        <p>Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the County Legislature, said tax increases should be a last resort, to come only after all possible spending cuts were made. It is an idea the authority has also expressed in recent days.</p>
        <p>Despite palpable tension over the issue, Richard M. Kessel, a member of the authority, known as NIFA, today urged Mr. Gulotta and the two parties in the County Legislature to work together, ''hopefully to come up with a consensus.''</p>
        <p>Although that appeared far from certain, Ms. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said the Democratic caucus would meet over the weekend to have a budget plan ready Monday.</p>
        <p>Of the up to $270 million to be borrowed next week, $42 million is to pay principal and interest due this year on current debt. The county's long-term debt, as of last December, was $2.6 billion. In June, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the county's bond rating to BBB-, the last level above junk status. The bonds sold through the authority will be rated AA, said Carol Kostik, NIFA's chief financial officer.</p>
