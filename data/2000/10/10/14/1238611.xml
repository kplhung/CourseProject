        <p>Stocks rallied yesterday after falling on Tuesday and Wednesday and plunging on Thursday. With investors jumping in to snap up bargains, as they have in the past, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite index, which had fallen the most, surged 7.9 percent, its second-biggest one-day gain ever.</p>
        <p>But the rally does not mean that investors have shrugged off the concerns that helped drive prices lower. These include higher oil prices, smaller-than-expected earnings increases and turmoil in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>None of those problems have gone away, although the price of crude oil fell yesterday and there were some positive earnings reports.</p>
        <p>Even with the surge in the Nasdaq, which rose more than twice the amount it fell on Thursday, the index is still down 18.5 percent for the year and is not even back to where it closed on Monday. The Dow is off 11.4 percent for the year and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index is down 6.5 percent.</p>
        <p>PMC-Sierra, Gateway and Juniper Networks all reported earnings that topped forecasts and pointed to what might finally stabilize the stock market. The question for investors now is whether the actual earnings reports that begin being announced in earnest next week will be positive enough to turn recent sellers into buyers.</p>
        <p>The flurry of negative earnings pre-announcements this quarter has been well above average and a surprise to many investors. But the current forecast for third-quarter earnings growth is for a rise of 15.9 percent, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. And if that prediction is backed up by actual numbers, then the negative tide of the last several weeks could turn.</p>
        <p>A report that retail sales in September jumped 0.9 percent may have also helped to reassure some investors. While economists say that the pace of economic growth is slowing, the retail sales report indicates that the rate of growth is not plunging, a fear that had gripped some investors recently. Instead, the data indicates that consumer spending is resilient, despite the surge in oil and gasoline prices this year. And that should help, not hurt, earnings prospects.</p>
        <p>''If earnings come through the way they should and if problems in the Mideast don't get worse, then maybe yesterday was the trough,'' said Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>He said the positive earnings reports yesterday could be a signal of the good news ahead. In addition, he says that the recent decline has made stock prices attractive again. Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, agreed, stating in a note to clients yesterday that the S.&amp; P. 500 index was 15 percent undervalued as of the close of the market Thursday.</p>
        <p>But Douglas R. Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, is not as sanguine. He says the earnings news ahead will be more disappointing than now expected. He also says high oil prices are going to have enough of an inflationary impact to push interest rates higher, another negative for stocks.</p>
        <p>He said that yesterday's performance was ''a very powerful relief rally and investors who had a lot of cash put it to work; but if that is right, there won't be much follow-through.''</p>
        <p>The stock market was led higher yesterday by many of the stocks that suffered earlier in the week. Even Home Depot, which helped set off Thursday's plunge with an earnings warning, managed to inch higher yesterday. Other stocks that rebounded were J. P. Morgan, Citigroup, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, Oracle, Intel, and General Electric.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, the Nasdaq was up 242.09 points, to 3,316.77, while the S.&amp; P. 500 climbed 44.39 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,374.17. The Dow jumped 157.60 points, to 10,192.18. The Dow was not even back to where it was on Wednesday and the S.&amp; P. 500 was still below its Tuesday close.</p>
        <p>In the bond market, investors were first buffeted by a stronger-than-expected rise in September producer prices for finished goods, which jumped 0.9 percent, and the sharp increase of 0.9 percent in retail sales. But the core rate of the P.P.I. climbed a less intimidating 0.3 percent and the turmoil in the Mideast, including the bombing at the British Embassy in Yemen, prompted other investors to buy Treasuries, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty. A drop in the price of oil may also have helped curb losses.</p>
        <p>The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note inched up to 5.72 percent from 5.71 percent Thursday as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped 3/32, to 100 7/32.</p>
        <p>James E. Glassman, the senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said he was not worried by either the jump in retail sales or the oil-induced surge in producer prices. He said that the rise in the core rate was probably distorted by a problem with shifting to the new model year for automobiles. As for retail sales, he said they were just a rebound from a sharp slowdown in July and August. He says that the economy is beginning to slow and that the recent sell-off in the stock market is re-enforcing that view among investors.</p>
        <p>''I think investors have been skeptical of the slowdown view,'' he said. ''But the damage that has been done in the stock market is making people believe that the slowdown is coming.''</p>
        <p>In the oil market, crude oil for November delivery dropped $1.07, or 3 percent, to $34.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price of heating oil for November delivery fell 6.12 cents, to $1.0161 a gallon. Although prices fell yesterday, if the United States is not successful in calming the situation in Israel, prices are likely to rise again.</p>
