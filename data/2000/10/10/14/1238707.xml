        <p>The previous two nights in St. Louis had been rough for the Cardinals, and arriving in New York did little to soothe their feelings. After flying through the night and landing at 5 o'clock yesterday morning, the team gathered in the afternoon for the bus to take them from the team hotel in Manhattan out to Shea Stadium for an off-day workout. But the Cardinals waited as the bus got caught in traffic caused by a rally near the United Nations, arriving 45 minutes late to pick them up at 1:30 p.m., the time they were scheduled to be on the field at Shea for their workout.</p>
        <p>Despite the inconvenience, Andy Benes, who will start Game 3 this afternoon, was excited and upbeat as he took his turn in the batting cage with Mark McGwire, Will Clark and Fernando Tatis. And why wouldn't he be upbeat, after injuries had made it far from certain that he would even be pitching in the postseason?</p>

        <p>The previous two nights in St. Louis had been rough for the Cardinals, and arriving in New York did little to soothe their feelings. After flying through the night and landing at 5 o'clock yesterday morning, the team gathered in the afternoon for the bus to take them from the team hotel in Manhattan out to Shea Stadium for an off-day workout. But the Cardinals waited as the bus got caught in traffic caused by a rally near the United Nations, arriving 45 minutes late to pick them up at 1:30 p.m., the time they were scheduled to be on the field at Shea for their workout.</p>
        <p>Despite the inconvenience, Andy Benes, who will start Game 3 this afternoon, was excited and upbeat as he took his turn in the batting cage with Mark McGwire, Will Clark and Fernando Tatis. And why wouldn't he be upbeat, after injuries had made it far from certain that he would even be pitching in the postseason?</p>
        <p>Pitching on a knee that needs surgery is a painful proposition, but one that he is trying to enjoy. Because of inflammation in his right knee, Benes must have the team physician, Dr. George Paletta Jr., drain his knee before each start.</p>
        <p>''My knee cartilage is frayed,'' said Benes, who was on the disabled list from Aug. 19 to Sept. 3 before returning for three relief appearances and three starts. ''I need to have it scoped. But it's just a matter of, I get my knee drained before I pitch and I wear a brace and go out and get them.''</p>
        <p>Ankiel Tries to Tame Pitches</p>
        <p>The Cardinals' Game 2 starter, Rick Ankiel, who lasted just two-thirds of an inning before being mercifully pulled from the game as he battled almost unfathomable wildness, was back on the mound yesterday, throwing with the pitching coach Dave Duncan. Despite his erratic control -- he had five wild pitches in one inning of his start against Atlanta in the first round of the playoffs and five pitches that bounded off the backstop on Thursday night against the Mets -- he said that all was back to normal.</p>
        <p>Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa said that with Darryl Kile scheduled to pitch Game 4 and Pat Hentgen set to go in Game 5, if there is one, Ankiel's next appearance might come out of the bullpen. Ankiel is eager for any opportunity.</p>
