        <p>Sheik Muhammad Seyyed Tantawi, resplendent in his formal gray robe and tightly wrapped white turban, pleaded in vain with the worshipers at Cairo's central mosque today.</p>
        <p>''Sit down, please,'' he begged, lowering himself to the carpeted floor. ''Won't you sit down so we can talk?''</p>
        <p>But the angry crowd, some weeping openly in frustration at the cleric's appeal for calm, would have none of it. They wanted strong words from Egypt's top Islamic authority, words that would call the people to a holy struggle in solidarity with Palestinians against Israel and, by extension, the United States.</p>
        <p>''You have to declare war!'' shouted a veiled woman who was one of about 200 people gathered around Sheik Tantawi after his Friday Prayer sermon. ''You have to send people to fight. We have to do something more serious. People are getting killed over there.''</p>
        <p>''You want to fight?'' the sheik responded, in what became a two-hour debate with the crowd. ''No one is stopping you. But Egypt has already fought four times and lost a lot. What is more helpful to the Palestinians -- to just say we declare war or to do real things like supplying them with what is helpful?''</p>
        <p>It was an extraordinary confrontation between Egyptians and the religious leader of Al Azhar University, the oldest and most influential seat of learning in the Sunni Muslim world. And like the demonstrations that took place in many countries today after Friday Prayers, it was a forceful instance of the explosive mood in much of the Arab world after two weeks of unrest in Israel, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>The midday Friday Prayer is a time of public worship for Muslims,  to pray and to hear the sermon of a learned man. In countries like Egypt, where these religious leaders are often employees of the government, the weekly sermon often imparts the official line to the faithful.</p>
        <p>In his unusually brief sermon today, Sheik Tantawi tried to do what President Hosni Mubarak has tried to do in statements and government actions over the last days.</p>
        <p>The sheik called on Egyptians to channel their anger at Israel by donating blood, money and even weapons for Palestinians, but to cease flocking to the streets calling for war and a break in relations with Israel.</p>
        <p>''Shouting, protesting and condemning is meaningless,'' Sheik Tantawi said. ''Supplying weapons to those who fight to deter the aggressor is just and fair.''</p>
        <p>About 2,000 worshipers came to Al Azhar for the weekly communal prayer, but his appeal only heightened their anger. While a small group stayed inside the mosque to debate the prayer leader, the rest spilled out onto the plaza in front of the mosque, where they shouted for ''jihad,'' or holy war, against Israel.</p>
        <p>''Just give them arms now -- decide now,'' said Ali Hussein, a 45-year-old government worker who took part in the impromptu demonstration. ''I am frustrated because the sheik of Al Azhar just repeats Mubarak's words and does nothing. Enough humiliation. Enough degradation. We want to help the Palestinians liberate themselves.''</p>
        <p>Egypt has seen almost daily protests, mostly by university students,  in the last two weeks. Demonstrators have called for mobilization of the Egyptian Army to threaten Israel and cancellation of the 21-year-old Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.</p>
        <p>The police have tried, with general success, to restrict demonstrators to their campuses and to prevent the protests from gathering steam and getting out of control.</p>
        <p>But the Mubarak government has also sought to identify itself with the public mood. To help direct popular anger and head off competition from radical Islamic groups, it has set itself up as the main address for acceptable anti-Israeli sentiment.</p>
        <p>It has created a national fund to receive donations for Palestinian medical and social aid. Appeals for money are broadcast regularly on state television. Public clinics have set up blood banks for donations of blood to be sent to the Palestinians.</p>
