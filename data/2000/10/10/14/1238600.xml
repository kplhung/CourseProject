        <p>Scour Inc., the Los Angeles company that abets the trading of music and movies over the Internet, has filed for bankruptcy-law protection, a move the company said could shelter it from copyright infringement lawsuits it faces from record companies and movie studios.</p>
        <p>Scour, which is backed by Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood agent and former Walt Disney president, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy papers on Thursday in United States Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles. It said in court papers that legal claims against it could amount to more than $100 million.</p>

        <p>Scour Inc., the Los Angeles company that abets the trading of music and movies over the Internet, has filed for bankruptcy-law protection, a move the company said could shelter it from copyright infringement lawsuits it faces from record companies and movie studios.</p>
        <p>Scour, which is backed by Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood agent and former Walt Disney president, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy papers on Thursday in United States Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles. It said in court papers that legal claims against it could amount to more than $100 million.</p>
        <p>Scour operates an entertainment Web site and controversial music and movie exchange service called Scour Exchange. The record labels and movie studios have filed lawsuits against Scour, asserting that it was abetting copyright infringement through Scour Exchange.</p>
        <p>Like Napster, the controversial music start-up that is also facing lawsuits, Scour Exchange enables users of its site to exchange music freely; in addition, the service also lets users exchange movie files.</p>
        <p>Scour officials said the company would continue to operate, but it would do so with a reduced staff. Last month, the company eliminated 52 jobs, 80 percent of its work force.</p>
        <p>Scour joins a growing list of Internet companies in the last several weeks that have filed for bankruptcy protection or closed their doors altogether.</p>
        <p>Those moves extend a trend in which dozens of dot-com companies laid off employees in September and August, as they continued to struggle to find viable business models and achieve profitability.</p>
        <p>Among the latest victims, Chip shot.com, a Sunnyvale, Calif., company that sells golf equipment over the Internet, filed for Chapter 11 protection last week in San Jose, Calif.</p>
        <p>Scour filed for bankruptcy protection largely because of the cost of defending the lawsuits and the potential cost of losing them, according to people associated with the company. In a news release, Dan Rodrigues, Scour's president, said the company took the step to ''preserve Scour's future.''</p>
        <p>Scour, founded in 1997 by Mr. Rodrigues and several other University of California at Los Angeles students as a search engine and entertainment hub, was discovered last year by Mr. Ovitz in an article in the campus newspaper. Mr. Ovitz bought 20 percent of the company, but he later sought to disassociate himself from the concern when industry observers said it appeared to create a conflict.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz's talent management agency, the Artists Management Group, represents some artists whose works are freely traded on Scour Exchange.</p>
        <p>Michael Burns, a spokesman for the Artists Management Group, said Mr. Ovitz and the talent agency declined to comment about the bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>In its court filing, Scour listed about $1.2 million in assets and just under $4 million in debt, including $1 million owed to its largest creditor, Angel Investors, an early-stage venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>Officials from the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major record labels, declined to comment on what effect the bankruptcy filing would have on the lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Scour, meanwhile, also faces a lawsuit from its own public relations agency, CarryOn Communications. The agency filed its lawsuit last month, asserting that Scour owed $154,398 in unpaid fees.</p>
