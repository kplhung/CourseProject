        <p>In the world of politics, where secrecy is often equated with trying to hide something that people have a right to know, Jon S. Corzine's decision not to release his income tax returns has become a major issue.</p>
        <p>But in the rarefied world of Wall Street boardrooms, secrecy is not just acceptable but  routine. So those familiar with Mr. Corzine's past career as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company find nothing implausible or unusual about his contention that, despite his campaign for senator from New Jersey, he cannot release his tax returns because of a confidentiality agreement with the company.</p>
        <p>''One of the great joys about being in a private firm is that you don't have to tell nobody nothing about your income or your taxes,'' said one former partner of a Wall Street firm (not Goldman Sachs). ''Why would you tell anything you don't have to tell and why would you let any of your partners tell anything they don't have to tell?''</p>
        <p>And experts say the company has valid reasons to believe Mr. Corzine's returns would provide information its competitors might find valuable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, has released a large amount of information about his tax returns. His disclosures show, among other things, total income of $144.5 million during the four years from 1996 through 1999, when he was ousted from Goldman Sachs, and payments of $43.4 million in state, local and federal income taxes.</p>
        <p>But many candidates release their actual returns, something he has refused to do,  saying he is barred from doing so by the confidentiality agreement he signed when he became a partner of Goldman Sachs.  Goldman Sachs has refused to release him from that pledge, although it relaxed it enough to allow the disclosures that have been made. The firm says it fears that further disclosures would compromise confidential corporate information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's Republican rival, Representative Bob Franks, has seized upon Mr. Corzine's not releasing his returns. In a debate on Thursday, Mr. Franks called it an ''issue of trust,'' saying voters should be leery of a candidate who will not disclose such information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has repeatedly said he has provided all the information he can without betraying a legally binding agreement with the company.</p>
        <p>''All of that other stuff deals with Goldman's internal activities,'' Mr. Corzine said in a telephone interview yesterday, referring to the information in the tax returns that has not been released. ''If I had been the chief executive of a public company, all you would have seen'' in the returns, he said, would be the information that has already been released. He conceded, however, that more details about his personal finances might have been disclosed.</p>
        <p>Until it sold stock to the public last year, Goldman Sachs was a partnership that did not pay taxes directly, although it filed tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Instead, the taxes were paid by the partners, and their tax returns could provide some hints regarding how the company was doing or what the partners might not want to disclose.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's returns would not show how much money Goldman Sachs made, said Martin Nissenbaum, the national director of personal income tax planning for Ernst &amp; Young, a large accounting firm.</p>
        <p>But his returns would say how much Goldman Sachs paid in taxes  to foreign governments -- facts that conceivably could be used by a political opponent. They would reveal whether money was made in countries unpopular with some voters and facts of interest to competitors, who might discover that the company's profits had sagged in, say, Britain during a certain year while soaring in Japan.</p>
        <p>The returns would also provide information about tax-reduction strategies Mr. Corzine used that  were arranged by Goldman Sachs for all partners, said a former partner in the company, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The former partner of a Goldman Sachs competitor also focused on that. ''All firms do whatever is legal, aggressively legal, to shelter partners from taxes,'' he said. ''Some of that would not look pretty.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Corzine said, ''We weren't into tax shelters,'' adding that he referred to both himself and Goldman Sachs. He said the disclosures he has made show he does not own anything that could be considered a shelter.</p>
        <p>There is no universal definition of  what constitutes a shelter, and many tactics used to reduce taxes are quite legal and even encouraged by the government. For example, investors in low-income housing can receive a tax credit. And income from municipal bonds is exempt from federal income taxes. Mr. Corzine reported more than $1.3 million in such income over the four-year period.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Corzine did pay a lot of income taxes, and his principal deduction seems to have been for charitable contributions. Over the four-year period, he reported $24.9 million in charitable contributions, more than half of which came in 1999. The disclosures indicate that most of those contributions came in the form of appreciated assets, presumably common stock.</p>
        <p>The information Mr. Corzine has released shows he had an extraordinarily large amount of tax credits, about $8.5 million over the four years. Mr. Nissenbaum said it was likely the bulk of them were for foreign taxes paid by Goldman Sachs. Such payments can be used to reduce the amount of money owed to the I.R.S.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who has spent $50 million on his campaign, said in his debate with Mr. Franks on Thursday that he would like to release the returns themselves, and had asked Goldman Sachs for permission to do so. But, he added: ''I'm not going to enter public service by breaking the law. I signed a contract. People expect people to fulfill their obligations.'' If Mr. Corzine violated the contract, he could be sued by Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, in response, asked, ''Is it more important to protect a small group of people at Goldman Sachs, or is it more important to win the confidence and trust'' of the voters? He added: ''Mr. Corzine should find a way to make this information available to the people of New Jersey. And if he can't, I question whether or not his entrance into this race was fully considered.''</p>
        <p>There is some speculation on Wall Street as to whether the current leadership of Goldman Sachs is really interested in helping Mr. Corzine.  Henry Paulson, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, ousted Mr. Corzine in what amounted to a coup last year. Mr. Paulson has been critical of the way Mr. Corzine ran the firm, saying he did not consult enough with his partners.</p>
        <p>A current Goldman Sachs official, however, said it was ''ridiculous to think that emotions had anything to do with the decision'' not to allow Mr. Corzine to release his tax returns. Instead, the official said, the firm is concerned about disclosing confidential information to competitors and others, as well as with keeping faith with all partners who signed the confidentiality agreement.</p>
