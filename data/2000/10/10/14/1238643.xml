        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''In Debt,'' was released by Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, in his campaign against Representative Bob Franks for United States senator from New Jersey. It began running yesterday on television stations in New York and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Shrum, Devine &amp; Donilon.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Close-up pictures of Mr. Franks in extreme slow motion alternate with recycled video of a tanned, T-shirt-wearing Mr. Corzine, beaming as he talks to voters. Sinister electronic music alternates with Mr. Corzine's folksy, upbeat campaign soundtrack. Over Mr. Franks's face, the question is posed: ''WHY is Bob Franks running negative attacks?'' Beneath Mr. Corzine's image, captions announce ''Publicly disclosed finances,'' and the address for Mr. Corzine's site on the Internet, www.votecorzine.org. The commercial ends with another picture of Mr. Franks, his face obliterated by the warning, ''BOB FRANKS: Deep in Debt to the Special Interests.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''Why is Bob Franks running negative attacks against Jon Corzine? Jon Corzine has publicly disclosed his personal finances and made them available on his Web site. Bob Franks has taken $170,000 from the big drug companies, $150,000 from the insurance industry, $70,000 from big oil and gas. He's so in debt to the special interests, he voted to funnel $40 billion to the insurance companies.</p>
        <p>''Jon Corzine. Unbought. Unbossed.</p>
        <p>''Bob Franks. Deep in debt to the special interests.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Franks, technically speaking, is not running any commercials right now. He has so far bought just one week's worth of ads, which stopped running on Wednesday. Those ads did attack Mr. Corzine, using the language of recent newspaper editorials that called him untrustworthy and deceptive for not releasing his personal tax returns, and for obfuscating about his donations to charitable groups whose leaders later endorsed him. Mr. Corzine's response here neglects to say that the information available on his Web site includes summaries of his earnings and taxes over the last four years, but not his tax returns; these remain secret, covered by a confidentiality agreement with Mr. Corzine's former employer, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. Mr. Franks's receipt of campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical, insurance and energy industries date back to 1993, when he entered Congress; the ad seems to imply Mr. Franks raised the money during his Senate campaign alone. Mr. Franks voted for a $40 billion Republican prescription drug plan that would have provided subsidies to insurance companies to encourage them to cover drug costs for the elderly and disabled. But the Corzine campaign provided no basis for its assertion that Mr. Franks's vote was motivated by a ''debt'' to the insurance industry.</p>
        <p>SCORE CARD -- Mr. Franks has been trying for months to turn Mr. Corzine's millions into a liability. Here, Mr. Corzine tries to turn the criticism he has endured for weeks into a badge of honor. He neglects to mention that his financial disclosures were made only under enormous pressure from Mr. Franks, Republicans and independent critics. Mr. Corzine, who is spending more than $1.2 million a week for TV ads, may be betting he can reach more voters with this ad than will have read about his finances in the newspapers.</p>

        <p>THE AD CAMPAIGN  Correction:  October 15, 2000, Sunday  A picture yesterday with a capsule analysis of a new television commercial released by Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate from New Jersey, was published in error. It showed a scene from a new commercial by Mr. Corzine's opponent, Representative Bob Franks.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 16, 2000, Monday  A picture on Saturday with a capsule analysis of a new television commercial released by Jon S. Corzine, the New Jersey Democratic candidate for United States Senate, was published in error. It showed a scene from a new commercial in support of Mr. Corzine's opponent, Representative Bob Franks. A correction in this space yesterday misidentified the sponsor of the new commercial. It was paid for by the Republican Leadership Council, not by Mr. Franks.</p>
