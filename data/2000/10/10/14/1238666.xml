        <p>The Imax Corporation, the Canadian designer of giant movie screens and high-technology sound systems, canceled plans to sell itself after the price of its shares dropped 70 percent on Thursday on a warning that third-quarter results would be lower than expected. The shares fell $10.22, to $4.28, on Thursday; yesterday they gained $1, closing at $5.28. In a statement, the co-chief executives, Richard L. Gelfond and Bradley J. Wechsler, said that the stock price did not reflect Imax's long-term value and that the search for a ''strategic alternative,'' begun in July, would be scrapped. The stock was trading at $25 to $30 in August and early September on speculation that Imax might be bought by a big movie maker like Walt Disney. The company has built 220 large-screen theaters in 26 countries.</p>
