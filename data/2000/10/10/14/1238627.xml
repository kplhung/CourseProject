        <p>The president of Connecticut College, who has been a primary architect in remaking its hometown, New London, as well as the college, said yesterday that she would step down in June after taking a sabbatical during the spring semester.</p>
        <p>The announcement by the president, Claire L. Gaudiani, came several months after faculty members signed a petition asking her to resign from the selective liberal arts college, where she has been president for 12 years. But Dr. Gaudiani and other college officials said that the timing had been set in motion a year ago, and that at the end of the summer tensions had eased.</p>
        <p>''She has been truly transformational, both for New London and for the college,'' said George M. Milne Jr., a college trustee who is also senior vice president at Pfizer Inc. and a member of the New London Development Corporation, of which Dr. Gaudiani is also president.</p>
        <p>A French literature scholar, Dr. Gaudiani, 55, will spend her sabbatical term, beginning in January, at the Yale Law School, where she is to  work on a book on philanthropy, and then return for commencement and her own 35th reunion at the college. She said she had not decided what to do after that.</p>
        <p>David K. Lewis, the college's provost, a physical chemist who is on sabbatical this semester, will become acting president.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gaudiani will continue as president of the New London Development Corporation, a private, nonprofit group that Connecticut's governor, John G. Rowland, urged her to join in 1997.</p>
        <p>Under her leadership, the development corporation has overseen a huge new development initiative in New London, a blue-collar town of about 25,000 that is among the poorest in the state. The college, which has about 1,600 undergraduate students and accepted 32 percent of applicants this year, is perched on a bluff overlooking the town.</p>
        <p>As president of the development corporation, Dr. Gaudiani helped persuade Pfizer to move its global research and development division to New London. The move is expected to provide 2,100 new jobs.</p>
        <p>The state of Connecticut has  agreed to put millions of dollars into  a lakefront park and a wastewater treatment station nearby. The development corporation has also put together a plan to develop a site that is to include a hotel and conference center, condominiums and a marina.</p>
        <p>''This will create a whole new life for the city of New London, and it all happened at a pace that was by all accounts extraordinary,'' Dr. Gaudiani said.</p>
        <p>As at the college, however, her leadership has drawn both praise and criticism, including attacks from community members who say she did not consult them enough.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gaudiani said the complaints about her management style had nothing to do with her resignation, which she said she had discussed with her board a year ago. She said the timing was linked to the completion of several campus initiatives, including a fund-raising drive that raised $138 million, a new academic plan for the college and the strengthening of its top management.</p>
        <p>She attributed the recent dissension on campus to her frequent absences from campus while she was fund-raising. ''Communications can get a little rusty, and that contributes to making misunderstanding more possible, and that is what happened,'' she said yesterday. ''It is not so much the bumps in the road that are important, but how you recover from them.''</p>
        <p>Despite the strains, many on campus say Dr. Gaudiani is a visionary leader who has taken a solid liberal arts college and made it richer and  one of the most selective liberal arts colleges in the country. Since her arrival in 1988, the college has added 26 new endowed professorships and spent $60 million on new buildings and renovations.</p>
        <p>''During President Gaudiani's tenure here, faculty, students, academic programs, physical facilities and finances have been strengthened impressively,'' said Scott Warren, a botany professor and chairman-elect of the faculty steering and conference committee.</p>
        <p>Dale Turza, a 1971 graduate of the college and chairwoman of the alumni association, said that Dr. Gaudiani has also been a ''huge success'' with alumni. ''They adore her.''</p>
        <p>She said that in raising the quality of the student body and the faculty, the president made demands that sometimes created friction. But, Ms. Turza said, ''She's an academic visionary and she has clearly taken the college to a whole other level.''</p>
