        <p>Hammering again at Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman today visited one of the desperately poor shantytowns strung along the Rio Grande, accusing the governor of failing to improve conditions there.</p>
        <p>Walking along the narrow, muddy roads of this village, Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, listened as the Mexican immigrant residents -- many of them United States citizens -- told of living with intermittent, undrinkable running water, overburdened septic tanks, unpaved roads and rampant disease.</p>
        <p>''We have so many needs here,'' Isidra Tovar, a mother of two small children, told the senator. ''Look at this place. We don't have any pavement. The mailman won't even come here down the road. It seems like this subdivision doesn't even exist, because we never have nothing here.''</p>
        <p>What the people here are asking for are ''the kinds of basic services most Americans take for granted,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''If you walk down these streets, this is not what we think of as America.''</p>
        <p>In the last two weeks, the campaign of Mr. Lieberman's running mate, Vice President Al Gore, has made Mr. Bush's record in Texas a central part of its message, warning in campaign appearances and television commercials that conditions in the state could be duplicated elsewhere if Mr. Bush became president. Mr. Lieberman carried that message yesterday to Odessa, in West Texas, to call attention to pollution there.</p>
        <p>''These acts of failed leadership by Governor Bush are part of what the American people should consider as they decide how to vote this year,'' he said today.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration said the ''colonias,'' ramshackle, unincorporated settlements in the state's border regions, and the environmental problems long predate the governor's tenure, and that he should be credited for trying to address them.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush has also been assailed by Hispanic leaders and advocates for the poor, for never having visited a colonia, an omission they say shows his insensitivity.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to go to Alaska to know it's cold, and I don't think you have to go to colonias to know what it's like,'' said Elton Bomer, Mr. Bush's secretary of state, whom the governor has put in charge of addressing problems of the colonias. In a conference call with reporters that was arranged by the Bush campaign, Mr. Bomer said such a visit would be no more than ''a photo op.''</p>
        <p>Texas has 1,400 colonias -- the Spanish word translates as colony, but is also used to mean neighborhood -- from El Paso to Brownsville, which are home to about 400,000 people. Most are here in the Rio Grande Valley, the southernmost part of the state and one of the poorest parts of the country.</p>
        <p>The colonias have long been neglected by politicians in both parties, according to local elected officials, though they argued that Democratic governors have shown somewhat more commitment to them.</p>
        <p>''No one has done more to improve the living conditions of the Texas colonias than Governor Bush has,'' Mr. Bomer said. But Texas Democrats insist that Mr. Bush's Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, did more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bomer said $600 million has been spent on the colonias under Mr. Bush; but only $250 million of that was state money, and that state money came from bond acts approved by voters during previous administrations. He said the state planned to spend $25 million on sewer hookups for the villages. Mr. Bush also signed a bill eliminating some bureaucratic barriers to connecting colonias to sewer, water and electric service.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush has also opposed several pieces of legislation that would have greatly increased state spending on the communities.</p>
        <p>El Flaco, home to 40 families, is 20 miles outside the city of McAllen, and about 15 miles from the Rio Grande. Many of the houses have plywood walls, no glass in the windows or corrugated tin roofs, and many were built by the people who inhabit them. Some residents work in the nearby citrus fields, or are migrant farm workers, while others hold jobs in nearby towns.</p>
        <p>In heavy rains, residents said, the septic tanks back up into the streets, and the roads become impassable, so that the school buses will not come to pick up the children. Nighttime violence is common.</p>
        <p>Hepatitis and other ailments linked to the unsanitary conditions are common, they said, and the nearest medical clinic is 10 miles away. ''The kids are sick all the time,'' said Alma Delia Ortiz. She and others say the pesticides sprayed on nearby farms often blow into their homes, leaving them coughing.</p>
