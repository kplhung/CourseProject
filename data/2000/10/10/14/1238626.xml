        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has avoided evidence that nuts and bolts used in airplanes are frequently substandard, according to a government audit released today.</p>
        <p>While belatedly questioning the accuracy of tests at an Air Force laboratory that found strong indications of a problem, the aviation agency has refused to do so much as visit the laboratory to verify its claim, the report said.</p>
        <p>The office of the inspector general of the Transportation Department, which includes the F.A.A., said in a letter accompanying its audit that the failure to react appropriately to warnings of safety ''suggests a systemic weakness in F.A.A.'s process to evaluate safety issues brought to the agency's attention.''</p>
        <p>Defective bolts could cause a plane crash. From March to December of last year, defective bolts failed on 10 engines, according to the inspector general, and caused one engine to shut down in flight.</p>
        <p>Eliot Brenner, a spokesman for the F.A.A., said it was ''an oversight'' not to have visited the laboratory, at Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, to resolve the question of its accuracy. David Barnes, a spokesman for the inspector general, said that the agency had approved the use of the testing laboratory before the work began. But after the laboratory came back with results showing a problem, the F.A.A. cast doubt on its quality but would not investigate.</p>
        <p>The auditor's office raised the issue of fasteners with the agency in September 1999, saying that 32 percent of a sample evaluated at Hill had threads that did not meet specifications. Eight months later, according to the new report, F.A.A. officials  responded that the fasteners did not really fail to meet the standards but that the laboratory tests were inaccurate.</p>
        <p>But instead of evaluating the laboratory's equipment or even visiting the laboratory, the agency had the fasteners retested by the companies that made them in the first place, the audit said.</p>
        <p>It said the agency should do more than ''merely accepting retest results from the manufacturers, which have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the tests.''</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. did hire a consultant to test the fasteners, and the consultant found that only 3 percent failed to meet the standards, the report said. But the auditors also noted that the  consultant was not accredited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brenner said the fasteners had performed well.</p>
        <p>''If fasteners were failing at the rate suggested by this data, manufacturers would be in our conference room pounding their fists on the table demanding some kind of action,'' he said. ''But they're not. The parts are holding together.''</p>
        <p>The adequacy of fasteners became a national concern a decade ago, when the federal government began investigating whether contractors had supplied faulty fasteners for the space shuttle program and for various weapons systems. In 1990, Congress passed the Fastener Quality Act to strengthen standards. Hill Air Force Base, in Ogden was accredited under the 1990 law.</p>
