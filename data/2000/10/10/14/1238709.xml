        <p>The Yankees and the Mets have work to do before the Subway Series becomes a reality, and Manager Joe Torre said that first he was focusing on ''our part of it.''</p>
        <p>''The other part,'' he added, ''I'm just a spectator.''</p>
        <p>But if a Subway Series should occur, the Brooklyn-born Torre thinks it would be ''dynamite for the people of New York.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees improved their chances, defeating the Seattle Mariners, 8-2, tonight and taking a 2-1 lead in the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>Torre grew up a fan of the New York Giants, and he attended a World Series game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Yankees. Then, Torre said, the allegiances were split three ways and the fans of whichever team that was not involved in the Subway Series were indifferent to the outcome.</p>
        <p>''There was always a portion of the fans that didn't care,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>The change in the news media will feed into that frenzy, Torre believes.</p>
        <p>''At that time, if you were a baseball fan, you got your information,'' Torre said. ''Now you don't have to be a baseball fan to get caught up in it; it's all over the place. At that time, there were still other things going on.''</p>
        <p>Torre does not believe that his players, who mostly played down the emotion of the interleague series with the Mets during the regular season, will be distracted by the possibility of a Subway Series.</p>
        <p>''I think they realize it's impossible to have a Subway Series if they're not involved in it,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>He agreed with the theory that if the Yankees and the Mets were to play a World Series, the Mets would have more to gain than the Yankees, from the perception of fans.</p>
        <p>''No question, because we've been around longer,'' Torre said. ''The history on our side, what we've accomplished. If they beat us out at every position, we would be the favorite from tradition side -- not that we should, because we're a better team. I think people just look at the Yankees that way.''</p>
        <p>Torre said he has thought for months that the Mets are a very good team, ''a very well-balanced team.''</p>
        <p>''At the time, I thought they had a better bullpen than the Braves did,'' he said. ''Their biggest problem this year is that they couldn't beat the Braves.</p>
        <p>''When you look at the relievers that Bobby can call out of there,'' Torre said, referring to Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, ''they've got someone for just about every situation.''</p>
        <p>The Knoblauch Theory</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch has been used exclusively as a designated hitter during the playoffs. But if the Yankees advance to the World Series, then Joe Torre expects he will use Knoblauch at second base during the games played in the National League park, where the designated hitter will not be used.</p>
        <p>Torre has been playing Luis Sojo at second base in the playoffs. Knoblauch's ''defense isn't awful; he's gotten so much better,'' Torre said. ''The reason why I did it is that we weren't scoring runs, and I had a choice.''</p>
        <p>Olerud's Observations</p>
        <p>John Olerud, the Seattle first baseman and a former member of the Mets, offered a theory as to why the Mets' Edgardo Alfonzo is such a good late-inning hitter.</p>
        <p>''He handles breaking balls so well,'' Olerud said. ''I think when you get into those situations, they're trying to make tough pitches against you, and he really handles breaking balls well.''</p>
        <p>Alfonzo had another big hit late in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, lining a breaking ball over second base -- after seeing nothing but fastballs previously in the at-bat -- to score Timo Perez.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, Olerud said that teammate Alex Rodriguez, who can become a free agent after this season and may be courted by the Mets, asked him about what it was like to live in New York.</p>
        <p>''I told him why I liked it,'' Olerud said. ''I think he was just interested.''</p>
