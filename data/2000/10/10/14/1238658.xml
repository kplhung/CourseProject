        <p>Benny Agbayani and Robin Ventura have hit important home runs. Jay Payton has two game-winning runs batted in. Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile have knocked in a combined five runs in St. Louis. Timo Perez has sparked rally after rally, and the bench players have made valuable contributions.</p>
        <p>The Mets have won their last five playoff games and hold a 2-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game National League Championship Series. Players have taken turns as the hero, and that, says their marquee player, is the biggest reason the Mets can reach the World Series by the end of the weekend.</p>
        <p>''That's what we were doing when we were hot during the season,'' Piazza said. ''That's what a balanced team is, and that's what winning teams have to have. It gives you confidence knowing that everyone in the lineup's capable of contributing.''</p>
        <p>Piazza today faces the St. Louis right-hander Andy Benes, a pitcher he hits very well, in Game 3 at Shea Stadium. Piazza's efforts in the regular season lifted the Mets to the playoffs, but another Met contributes the most at this time of year.</p>
        <p>There is a consensus in the clubhouse on who leads this team in October. It is Edgardo Alfonzo, the second baseman, and the feeling might be unanimous.</p>
        <p>''No disrespect to anybody else on this team, Mike or Robin or Todd, but when we get in a situation where we need a hit, where we need a guy to come through, everybody on this team wants Fonzie at the plate,'' outfielder Darryl Hamilton said. ''He's been so huge for us, so clutch for us.''</p>
        <p>After admiring Alfonzo from a distance as an American Leaguer, Zeile has marveled at him this year. Zeile says Alfonzo fields his position as well as anyone, and hits to all fields for average and power.</p>
        <p>''But the most impressive thing this season, so far, is he just never seems to stop coming up with the big hit,'' Zeile said. ''Put him out there when times are tough, and he's going to get a knock.''</p>
        <p>Alfonzo started that trend last fall, when he homered in the one-game playoff at Cincinnati and ripped a grand slam in the first game of the division series at Arizona.</p>
        <p>This year, he has hit safely in all six of the Mets' postseason games, for a .333 average, and he has driven in a run in the last five. Only the Yankees' Bernie Williams has a longer R.B.I. streak in one postseason, a six-game stretch in 1996.</p>
        <p>It was Alfonzo who saved the Mets in Game 3 of the division series, when the Giants needed four outs to take a two-games-to-one lead and called on their closer, Robb Nen, who had not blown a save in four months. Alfonzo stroked a game-tying double, and the Mets won five innings later.</p>
        <p>On Thursday in St. Louis, Alfonzo singled to briefly put the Mets ahead in the eighth inning. On the bench, Payton, a rookie, approached the veteran reserve Lenny Harris.</p>
        <p>''This guy's clutch,'' Payton said, and Harris agreed. ''But you know what?'' Harris said. ''So are you.''</p>
        <p>Payton looked at Harris, uncertain but uplifted. The next inning, Payton broke a tie with his own single, and that hit won the game.</p>
        <p>Two different leadership styles influenced Payton: Alfonzo's example and Harris's confident words. Alfonzo says little, but he pays attention and listens, which can be just as important.</p>
        <p>Harris rarely starts, and when Alfonzo senses he is feeling down, he talks to him so he feels included. When he sees Payton being too aggressive at the plate, Alfonzo suggests he take a pitch or two. When Hamilton struggled to understand the news media scrutiny in New York, Alfonzo taught him how to handle it.</p>
        <p>''He likes talking to guys on the team,'' Hamilton said. ''A lot of superstars are on their own.''</p>
        <p>Alfonzo can now be spoken of as a superstar; the ''overlooked'' tag is wearing away the deeper the Mets go in the postseason. He made his first All-Star team this year and batted .324 with 25 homers and 94 R.B.I.</p>
        <p>But the biggest validation of Alfonzo's star status is not the All-Star ring he wears or the World Series ring he hopes to earn this month. It is the way he is regarded in his native Venezuela. Alfonzo grew up admiring his countrymen like Dave Concepcion and Ozzie Guillen, and now he is in the same class.</p>
        <p>''You hear, 'I want to be like this guy,' and it's a great feeling, because I went through that; I know how it feels,'' Alfonzo said. ''I just try to be a good role model for my kids and for the kids of the world, especially in the Latin countries.''</p>
        <p>Last winter, for the first time in years, Alfonzo did not participate in winter ball in Venezuela. The Mets asked him not to and Alfonzo complied, but he missed taking part. He is hoping to play, at least briefly, this winter.</p>
        <p>After the former Met Melvin Mora excelled in last year's playoffs, Mora said he was unaffected by the pressure because of his experience in the Venezuelan winter league.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo said the same thing yesterday in explaining why he performed so well under the most intense pressure.</p>
        <p>''If you play in the big leagues, they want you to do the best,'' Alfonzo said of the winter ball crowds. ''There's a lot of pressure, and they are really aggressive. Everything they have in their hand, they throw to you when you do something bad, and they start saying bad words to you.</p>
        <p>''It was a pretty good experience. You learn every year.''</p>
        <p>Leading the Mets in October is becoming another annual experience. Watching Alfonzo, the Mets know they are learning from the best.  ''Fonzie could be 0 for 50 -- which he probably never has been and never will be -- but you'd never be able to tell,'' Payton said. ''He could have 50 hits in a row and he would stay cool, on an even keel.</p>
        <p>''He's quiet and funny, in his own little way. Whenever he says something to me, that's a guy you're going to listen to and take it to heart, because he has been so successful.''</p>
