        <p>NOTHING David Justice heard over his shoulder last night could ever match the crude and malicious taunts he used to hear in Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Playing in his 85th postseason game, a record for that category, Justice drove in three runs as the Yankees beat the Mariners, 8-2, in Game 3, to take a two-games-to-one lead in the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>Having recently passed Reggie Jackson for the number of games played in the postseason, Justice is surprised that he has done it as an important member of the Yankees rather than as a member of the vilified opposition.</p>
        <p>Since coming over from Cleveland on June 29, he has come to see the good side of the House of Autumnal Angst. The denizens curse visiting players and rip the caps off the heads of visiting fans, but true to their twisted Steinbrennerian code, they scream at their own only when they mess up. (''Hey, Knobby, yuh stink! Hey, Knobby, dattaway!'')</p>
        <p>It isn't that way in Seattle or in most places. In the hideous gloom of the defunct Kingdome or in the bracing bay air of Safeco Field, they boo select targets like Paul O'Neill, but generally save their vocal cords for cheering for their own. It's kind of nice.</p>
        <p>It's also true that Yankee Stadium has the acrid aroma of burnt meat and Safeco Field smells like stir-fry from the stand called the Intentional Wok, but that's another story.</p>
        <p>Justice can remembering hearing a career's worth of up-close-and-personal jibes when he played for Cleveland during the 1997 and 1998 October series against the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Let's put it this way: the chant of ''Hal-lie! Ber-ry!'' -- to remind him of his divorce from the actress -- was hardly the worst of it. Justice had the proper way to deal with it, however -- turning his head and smiling at the fans.</p>
        <p>''New York fans are really enthusiastic, knowledgeable, passionate,'' Justice said here. ''I knew they were just trying to bother me, and it doesn't bother me.''</p>
        <p>Justice never gave any thought to playing in New York. He had rung up 77 postseason games on his tour of the two politically incorrect franchises in Atlanta and Cleveland that continue to use Native Americans as mascots.</p>
        <p>He played in 46 postseason games with Atlanta and another 31 in Cleveland, appearing in four World Series. Just like Reggie, Justice came to New York to set the record.</p>
        <p>''All it means is that I've been on a lot of teams that made the playoffs,'' Justice said, catching the apples-and-bananas flavor of the statistic.</p>
        <p>Justice is the career leader because he has played in 21 games in the first round of the playoffs, grandiosely labeled the ''division series,'' an entity that did not exist until 1995.  Reggie's 77 postseason games were accumulated in the era that began in 1969, when there was a league championship series and a World Series.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, there is an overload of these statistics fluttering across the bottom of the television screen and crawling into our fevered brains. The real mischief is when the ''postseason'' games become confused with the World Series, once a grand solitary event until baseball's deep thinkers downgraded it into something approximately ''the finals.''</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, the World Series exploits of Ford and Berra, Gomez and Mantle, with the occasional Snider thrown in the mix, were the standards of the fall. Interleague play obviously adds to the cheapening of the World Series. Yes, a Subway Series in New York would be a certifiable Big Event, but imagine the anticipation if the Mets and Yankees did not play each other half a dozen times in midsummer.</p>
        <p>Anyway, Justice is now the holder of the postseason record, but more importantly, he is the man who hammered the big double that began the Yankees' seven-run rally on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre said Justice jumped so high on a questionable strike call that ''when he came down he was a different player.'' The manager watches newcomers like Justice and Glenallen Hill hold back, knowing this bunch won three World Series in the past four years.</p>
        <p>''Players feel they have to act a certain way,'' Torre said the other day. ''Glenallen came over and asked, 'Should I shave my head?' I did tell him to shave his head.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, talent asserts itself. Justice wound up hitting .305 with the Yanks and hitting 20 homers and driving in 60 runs.</p>
        <p>''A great bunch of guys,'' Justice said of his teammates.</p>
        <p>He said the same about the Yankee Stadium fans. And they say the same about him. As long as he continues to hit home runs, that is.</p>
