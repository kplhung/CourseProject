        <p>The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, called this week for President Clinton and the Democrats to help Republicans pass a tax deduction for uninsured families that buy health policies with little or no help from their employers. The Democrats should not take the invitation seriously. The proposed tax deduction would be ineffective, expensive and stacked in favor of high-income families.</p>
        <p>The Republicans propose to give individuals who buy coverage on their own, or who pay for half or more of their employer-provided coverage, a 100 percent tax deduction. The idea, say the Republicans, is to give those whose employers do not chip in much for coverage the same break as people who work for employers that do provide ample coverage.</p>

        <p>The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, called this week for President Clinton and the Democrats to help Republicans pass a tax deduction for uninsured families that buy health policies with little or no help from their employers. The Democrats should not take the invitation seriously. The proposed tax deduction would be ineffective, expensive and stacked in favor of high-income families.</p>
        <p>The Republicans propose to give individuals who buy coverage on their own, or who pay for half or more of their employer-provided coverage, a 100 percent tax deduction. The idea, say the Republicans, is to give those whose employers do not chip in much for coverage the same break as people who work for employers that do provide ample coverage.</p>
        <p>But as recent estimates by Prof. Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T. show, tax deductions do almost nothing to persuade the uninsured to buy coverage. About 90 percent of the tax cut will go to individuals who are already buying coverage without the government's help. A tax deduction provides no financial relief to families that do not pay taxes, and it saves other low-income families a mere 15 cents for every dollar spent on premiums. Those two categories include some 95 percent of the nation's uninsured families. The Republican proposal will cost $40 billion over 10 years and yet do almost nothing to reduce the number of uninsured people.</p>
        <p>If the Republicans truly wanted to help the uninsured, they would propose a refundable tax credit. Tax credits offset the cost of insurance dollar for dollar. For families too poor to owe tax, the credit is provided as a cash payment. Tax credits, unlike deductions, help families at the bottom of the income ladder.</p>
        <p>To make a sizable dent in the ranks of the uninsured, Congress would need to pass a large tax credit, costing tens of billions of dollars a year, like that proposed by Bill Bradley during his campaign for president. Short of that, Congress could spend a modest amount of money to expand the existing Children's Health Insurance Program that each state has set up to insure uninsured children. But under no circumstance does it make sense to throw away money on a tax deduction that few low-income families currently without insurance would ever bother to use.</p>
