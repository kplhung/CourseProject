        <p>They lined up outside Busch Stadium, by the indoor parking lot and facing -- of all things -- an avenue named Broadway. They huddled in sleeping bags or tents and kept the faith. Cardinal fans must be among the most devoted because these may have been wasting their time.</p>
        <p>Several hundred were stationed outside the stadium after the Mets seized a two-games-to-none lead in the National League Championship Series on Thursday night. They awaited World Series tickets, which go on sale in St. Louis this morning and may be useless by tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals will try to accomplish something no other team has done: come back from a two-game deficit in the N.L.C.S. after losing the first two at home. The nine teams that have led in that situation went on to the World Series. In the World Series, three teams have overcome that hurdle since 1985, when the Kansas City Royals beat the Cardinals. The Mets rallied the following year against the Boston Red Sox and the Yankees overcame the Atlanta Braves in 1996.</p>
        <p>''We're not in a good position,'' Mark McGwire said. ''It's their home where they've been playing very well all year.''</p>
        <p>The Red Sea that swarmed Busch Stadium this week could not stop the Mets, even when New York did not take advantage of Rick Ankiel's first-inning wildness. The Mets led, 2-0, but wasted that advantage, as well as leads of 3-1 and 5-3, before scoring in the ninth on Will Clark's error, Jay Payton's base hit and Jim Edmonds's misplay in center field.</p>
        <p>After the game, the Cardinals flew to New York, arriving at a Midtown hotel in the wee hours of the morning. Yesterday, during workouts at Shea Stadium and in interviews afterward, they maintained that they had not lost their confidence.</p>
        <p>''Other than the record, how can you be down about this club,'' Manager Tony La Russa said. ''And how can the club be down? You can't.''</p>
        <p>That self-assurance will be tested today at Shea Stadium, where the Mets had the best home record in baseball. They also won both of their postseason games there during the division series against the Giants.</p>
        <p>''We've been underdogs since Day 1 in the playoffs,'' said Andy Benes, who will be the Cardinals' starter in Game 3. ''And we're underdogs in this series.''</p>
        <p>Benes has frayed cartilage in his right knee that requires the joint to be drained before each start and will need surgery after the season. He did not pitch during the Cardinals' three-game sweep of the Braves last week. Last season with Arizona, he was also passed over when the Diamondbacks lost to the Mets in the division series. Benes has a 6.44 career earned run average during the postseason and has not pitched there since 1996. That season still stings for several Cardinals, but could serve as an inspiration.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals led the Braves, three games to one, and were ready to face the Yankees in the World Series before losing the next three games. Benes pitched in relief in the decisive seventh game after Donovan Osborne allowed six runs in the first inning.</p>
        <p>''It took a long time,'' Walt Jocketty, the St. Louis general manager, said when asked how long it took the Cardinals to recover. ''That was tough.''</p>
        <p>That series changed the Cardinals' fortunes. They finished 16 games under .500 the following season, but reshaped the team by acquiring McGwire in a trade with Oakland.</p>
        <p>McGwire hit 70 home runs in 1998, but the team became one-dimensional. The Cardinals finally invested heavily in pitching last winter and returned to the N.L.C.S.</p>
        <p>Rick Reed, the Mets' starter for Game 3, had an 8.00 earned run average against the Cardinals this year, but he has proved to be a big-game pitcher in two postseasons with the team. He enters today's game with a 2.84 E.R.A. in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Reed, a right-hander, would also allow the Cardinals to use their normal lineup. La Russa, who changed half his starters to face the left-handed Al Leiter in Thursday's game, would not reveal his lineup for today, but he will most likely revert to batting the left-handed batters Edmonds and Clark third and fourth, respectively.</p>
        <p>La Russa also said that third baseman Placido Polanco (tight hamstring) would be available, but did not commit to starting him.</p>
        <p>Fernando Tatis started at third on Thursday and hit a game-tying double in the fifth inning. Polanco was used as a pinch-hitter in the eighth inning but was replaced by J. D. Drew after the Mets brought in Turk Wendell to relieve John Franco.</p>
