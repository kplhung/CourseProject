        <p>The deeper the Yankees move into October, the more they look the way they usually do this time of year, confident and relaxed, on track, like the D train moving steadily through the Bronx, closing in on the city.</p>
        <p>The Yankees put a headlock on the Mariners tonight, when Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez ripped back-to-back homers among the team's 13 hits, Andy Pettitte pitched six and two-thirds solid innings, and the bullpen closed out Seattle in an 8-2 victory in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>The Yankees hold a two-games-to-one advantage in the four-of-seven-game series, and in Game 4 here Saturday, Roger Clemens will pitch against Seattle's Paul Abbott.</p>
        <p>Even if the Mariners rebound, they cannot win this series without winning at least one game in Yankee Stadium. ''Tonight was the biggest game of the series,'' Yankees second baseman Luis Sojo said. ''We need to get that one tomorrow, to make the series basically over.''</p>
        <p>Mariano Rivera relieved with one out in the eighth inning of a 4-2 game and a runner at second, and he retired the final five batters, extending his streak of consecutive scoreless innings in the postseason to 33 1/3. That broke the 38-year-old record of the Yankees legend Whitey Ford (33 innings), set as a starter in the World Series from 1960 to 1962.</p>
        <p>Rivera has not allowed a run in the playoffs since surrendering a home run to Cleveland's Sandy Alomar in 1997.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scored seven runs in their final at-bat of Game 2, and Manager Joe Torre mentioned afterward that he noticed the same patience in their at-bats, the approach that has become their trademark. ''You probably couldn't have mapped out a better game offensively for us,'' third baseman Scott Brosius said. ''That's a great formula for us to win games.''</p>
        <p>And the Seattle starter, Aaron Sele, was probably the prototype pitcher for the Yankees to face when their offense is starting to emerge from its monthlong slump. Sele had 14 decisions in games with the Yankees and lost 10 of them, including two playoff games while pitching for the Texas Rangers in 1998 and 1999. He was the Mariners' most consistent pitcher this year, winning 17 games during the regular season and earning the trust of his manager. Lou Piniella aligned Sele as his Game 3 starter so if the series were to extend to a Game 7, Sele would throw that game as well.</p>
        <p>But Sele carried to the mound all of that dubious history against the Yankees, and if that wasn't enough reason for self-doubt, there was this: In the early innings, Sele could not throw strikes with his curveball, the pitch with which he usually attacks hitters. He tried back-to-back curveballs to the leadoff hitter, Chuck Knoblauch, in the first inning and both bounced, and Sele struggled to make the correction in his release point, with some breaking ball spinning too high, some too far outside. ''</p>
        <p>That made Sele vulnerable; the Yankees knew that when Sele had to throw a strike, he was going to throw a fastball, in all likelihood.</p>
        <p>Williams opened the second inning after Seattle had scored a run in the bottom of the first. He got ahead in the count, 3-0, looked for the sign from the third-base coach, Willie Randolph, and it was a green light for Williams to swing, if he wanted to. When Sele threw a fastball thigh high, where Williams likes it, the Yankees' center fielder drove it five or six rows into the right-field stands.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez followed, got ahead in the count, two balls and one strike; again, Sele had to throw a strike. The Seattle right-hander conceded a high fastball, and Martinez -- the rarest of left-handed batters because he prefers high pitches instead of low pitches -- hammered the ball to straightaway center field, over the wall, a monstrous homer. The Yankees hit two homers in their first 237 at-bats of the postseason, before Williams and Martinez went back to back, and the Yankees had a 2-1 lead.</p>
        <p>They added another run in the third. Derek Jeter was on first with two outs, David Justice at the plate,  Williams on deck, and again, Sele got into trouble. He went to 2 balls and 1 strike on Justice. Williams was looming on deck, his career average against Sele over .300, so Sele could not afford to walk Justice. He also could not throw his curveball for a strike.</p>
        <p>He threw to first, stepped off the rubber, seemingly reluctant to throw his next pitch. He needed to throw the fastball, as Justice certainly ascertained by that point, and Justice ripped a liner to left-center field, the ball shooting to the wall, Jeter sprinting around the bases with the Yankees' third run.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until the middle innings that Sele finally began to throw his curveball for strikes. This is how predictable Sele was for the Yankees: They did not swing and miss until his 71st pitch, when Justice struck out in the sixth, and only that one time among his 90 pitches. ''They spread it out and keep the pressure on you 1 to 9,'' said Sele, referring to the Yankees' lineup. ''They force you to make good pitch after good pitch, and I didn't do it.''</p>
        <p>Seattle sprayed nine hits against Pettitte, but he managed to limit the damage, getting Jay Buhner to ground out weakly and John Olerud to pop up to kill a rally in the first inning, breaking Henderson's bat in the second inning and producing a slow groundout with runners at second and third. The left-hander's resiliency bought time for his teammates to keep working on Sele.</p>
        <p>Williams singled through the middle with one out in the sixth inning. Martinez chopped a dribbler up the first-base line, the ball rolling perhaps 40 feet. Sele darted over, picked up the grounder, but was unable to grip the ball and make a throw.</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada flied deep to right field, enabling Williams to tag up and take third base and bringing Paul O'Neill to the plate. Sele fell behind,  two balls and no strikes, in a defensive position again, and shortly thereafter O'Neill pulled a single through the hole between first and second to drive home Williams - O'Neill's first run-scoring hit since Sept. 23, after 15 unsuccessful attempts with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>The Yankees kept pressing, tacked four more runs in the ninth. Every starting position player other than Posada had at least one hit in the game. Five players drove in runs, six scored runs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are gaining speed, with two more stops to go before the World Series.</p>
