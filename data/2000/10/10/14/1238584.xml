        <p>William P. Youngworth III, the antiques dealer who claimed three years ago that he could broker the return of the immensely valuable paintings stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum here, is back.</p>
        <p>That is, Mr. Youngworth got out of prison today, after serving three years on an unrelated charge of possession of a stolen van. He could have been held 12 more years, his lawyer, Lisa Siegel Belanger, said, but the State Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that he should not be considered a habitual offender, leading to his release.</p>
        <p>Mr. Youngworth is also back in the sense that he has returned to statements similar to those he made three years ago, when he contended that he could ''facilitate'' the return of the Gardner paintings. Stolen in 1990 in the biggest art theft in American history, they include Rembrandt's only known seascape and a Vermeer and are estimated to be worth perhaps $300 million.</p>
        <p>''There's a big rush now to get this thing resolved,'' Mr. Youngworth said today in a telephone interview.  ''My position is, that's fine, that's your problem. My problem is that my life has to be restored to the station it was in; I have to get my son and myself resettled and get my business back in order.''</p>
        <p>In general, Mr. Youngworth said, ''There seems to be a very positive dialogue opened up recently between the authorities and my attorneys and the museum officials, and I'm hoping we can come to a positive resolution very quickly, because this is a ride I want to get off.''</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. declined to comment on Mr. Youngworth's assertions.</p>
        <p>Anne Hawley, director of the museum, said, ''I'm not aware of what is going on with the authorities, but I always say the museum will cooperate with the investigation and that we continue to hope to get our stolen artwork back.'' (And meanwhile, she added, the museum has a wonderful Rembrandt exhibit going on, even without the stolen painting.)</p>
        <p>Nothing ever came of Mr. Youngworth's offers to provide a lead to the art in exchange for immunity and reward money, which he made as he was facing a 15-year sentence for receiving the stolen van.</p>
        <p>Mr. Youngworth, who has a long criminal record, argued today that the problem in the past was that the authorities had been trying to ''extort his cooperation'' through the sentences hanging over his head.</p>
        <p>Another factor has changed since then as well: Myles J. Connor Jr., a notorious art thief who some law enforcement authorities believe holds the key to the paintings' return, recently got out of jail himself. When he was released in June after serving 11 years for transporting stolen goods and selling cocaine, Mr. Connor told The Boston Herald that he planned to go straight. He also said he would be happy to try to help the museum recover the art, both for its own sake and for the $5 million reward it would bring. There has been no word since of any progress.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Youngworth's release, all the players in the confusing game of who has the paintings are back on the board. What difference that makes remains to be seen. Mr. Connor and Mr. Youngworth used to be friends but have fallen out, and some law enforcement authorities question whether their claims about the missing art are real.</p>
        <p>Mr. Youngworth said today that there might have been an accident with one of the paintings recently, but he declined to elaborate.</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Youngworth said, he plans to ''disappear to parts unknown where no one will be able to find me.''</p>
