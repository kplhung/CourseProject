        <p>It isn't much, compared with the $50 million Jon S. Corzine has poured into his campaign for the United States Senate so far. But after struggling for months to raise money, the Republican candidate, Representative Bob Franks, is finally going to get a little help from his friends in Washington.</p>
        <p>Republican officials said today that the national party would release  $300,000 to $400,000 over the next few days to pay for new television commercials by Mr. Franks. As yet, he has run just a week's worth of television commercials, and only in the Philadelphia media market, which reaches sparsely populated South  Jersey.</p>

        <p>It isn't much, compared with the $50 million Jon S. Corzine has poured into his campaign for the United States Senate so far. But after struggling for months to raise money, the Republican candidate, Representative Bob Franks, is finally going to get a little help from his friends in Washington.</p>
        <p>Republican officials said today that the national party would release  $300,000 to $400,000 over the next few days to pay for new television commercials by Mr. Franks. As yet, he has run just a week's worth of television commercials, and only in the Philadelphia media market, which reaches sparsely populated South  Jersey.</p>
        <p>With the new infusion of money, Mr. Franks is expected to begin broadcasting his TV ads on New York stations, which reach the vast majority of New Jersey households, on Wednesday. In addition to that, officials said that either the National Republican Senatorial Committee or the Republican National Committee was likely to provide more than $100,000 to New Jersey Republican officials to help with telephone banks, direct mail and other get-out-the-vote efforts to aid Mr. Franks and other Republican candidates.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Franks is working with a distinct financial disadvantage. No credible candidate for the Senate from New Jersey has spent less than $7 million in recent years.</p>
        <p>Late today Mr. Franks released summaries of his fund-raising activities showing he had raised $2.1 million from June 30 to Sept. 30, for a total of $4.3 million since he became a candidate last year. Moreover, national Republican Party committees are limited under federal election law to a total expenditure of $841,000 on his behalf.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Corzine's latest filing with the Federal Elections Commission today showed he had spent $44 million as of Sept. 30, including about $6 million for television commercials. In addition, he has reserved at least another $6 million more for TV ads scheduled to run through Election Day.</p>
        <p>So far, the Corzine campaign has borrowed $42.4 million from Mr. Corzine himself -- meaning that, if elected, he could hold fund-raisers to pay off his debts to himself. Ross Perot holds the record for spending his own money in a political race: he spent  $65.6 million in his 1992 bid for president.</p>
        <p>Given Mr. Corzine's ability and readiness to spend, and a succession of polls showing Mr. Franks lagging well behind Mr. Corzine, it had been widely believed that Republicans would use their money on closer Senate races, or races that were more evenly matched financially. But with time running out, and Mr. Corzine not yet running away with the race, Mr. Franks has come to be seen as a worthwhile investment.</p>
        <p>''The main trigger is that this is now an incredibly cheaper state,'' said a Republican official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Months ago, if you were going to be doing saturation media, you would have been talking about $15 million to compete. But now, there are only three weeks left, yet we're still in striking distance in the polls. Even though we're going to get vastly outspent by Corzine, we can invest a relatively small amount of money  and potentially win this thing.''</p>
        <p>Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said recent polls, which have showed Mr. Franks behind by as much as 14 points, showed a silver lining: Mr. Corzine seemed to have reached a ceiling somewhere short of 50 percent, with a healthy number of voters remaining undecided.</p>
        <p>''There's not much more Corzine can do to get his numbers up over 50,'' Mr. Roy said. ''People are clearly looking for the alternative, and we have a window of opportunity to show them the alternative.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Corzine, Tom Shea, dismissed Republican hopes. ''The issue isn't that he doesn't have any money,'' he said of Mr. Franks. ''It's that he doesn't have any message.''</p>
        <p>This afternoon, in their second debate in two days, Mr. Franks continued his attacks on Mr. Corzine's campaign spending, accusing him of trying to buy the election. Mr. Corzine said Mr. Franks was suggesting ''voters aren't smart enough to decide for themselves who's going to best represent their interests.''</p>
        <p>The half-hour debate will be broadcast by WNBC-TV on Sunday at 11:30 a.m.</p>
