        <p>Today's KEY GAMES  NO. 7 OKLAHOMA 5-0  NO. 14at KANSAS STATE 6-0</p>
        <p>Finally, Kansas State faces a test and a smart passer in Josh Heupel. The Wildcats, fattening up on lesser teams, lead major colleges in scoring offense (51.3 points a game) and total defense (228.5 yards a game). They have outscored opponents, 308 to 61. Oklahoma's 63-14 runaway last Saturday over Texas was certainly an aberration, and Kansas State is a clear favorite.TV: ABC, 3:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 12 AUBURN 5-1  NO. 18at FLORIDA 5-1</p>
        <p>Rex Grossman, a redshirt freshman with a 64 percent completion average, 9 touchdowns and only 1 interception, will be Florida's quarterback again. The Gators' maligned defense stopped Louisiana State, and Auburn's potent offense gained only 164 yards in losing to Mississippi State.TV: CBS, 3:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 16 OREGON 4-1  NO. 18at SOUTHERN CAL 3-2</p>
        <p>Oregon, which upset Washington last time out with a good defense, faces a Trojan team whose offense was shaky in upset losses to Oregon State and Arizona. As Alex Holmes, Southern California's tight end, said dryly. ''I'm learning now that extreme criticism is a part of college football.''</p>
        <p>OTHER GAMES  EAST  Syracuse (3-2)  at Boston College (3-2)  Two solid ground games in a Big East tossup.  TV: ABC, Noon</p>
        <p>Temple (3-3)  at Rutgers (2-3)  Their running games, squashed by Virginia Tech amd Miami, have a chance to breathe again.</p>
        <p>Brown (3-1)  at Princeton (1-3)  Brown has the better offense and a sharper defense.</p>
        <p>Yale (3-1)  at Fordham (2-4)  Fordham, which took a beating from Brown, faces more of the same.</p>
        <p>Columbia (2-2)  at Penn (2-2)  Columbia's running and Penn's passing could make this a shootout.</p>
        <p>SOUTH  Vanderbilt (2-4)  at No. 8 Georgia (4-1)  Vanderbilt may not win a Southeastern Conference game all season.</p>
        <p>No. 21 Mississippi (4-1)  at Alabama (2-3)  Beware of Alabama, even though flanker Freddie Milons, its big-play threat, is out with an injured knee.</p>
        <p>TV: ESPN, 7 p.m.  No. 24 Arkansas (4-1)  at No. 22 South Carolina (5-1)  After this, Arkansas faces Auburn, Mississippi, Tennessee and Mississippi State and could lose to all.</p>
        <p>Southern Mississippi (4-1)  at Tulane (3-2)  Southern Mississippi has allowed one touchdown in the last four games.</p>
        <p>Army (0-5)  at East Carolina (3-2)  East Carolina's offense, dormant against Memphis, should get well here.</p>
        <p>MIDWEST  Minnesota (4-2)  at No. 4 Ohio State (5-0)  Ohio State is sneaking up on the Nebraskas and the Virginia Techs.  TV: ESPN2, Noon</p>
        <p>Purdue (4-2)  at No. 12 (tie) Northwestern (5-1)  Northwestern leads the Big Ten with its no-huddle, four-receiver spread shotgun offense and Damien Anderson's running.  TV: ESPN, Noon</p>
        <p>Navy (0-5)  vs. No. 19 Notre Dame (3-2)  at Orlando, Fla.  Notre Dame's offense should snap out of its deepest rut since 1963.</p>
        <p>TV: CBS, Noon  Indiana (2-3)  at Michigan (4-2)  Michigan is a good team that sometimes seems lost.</p>
        <p>SOUTHWEST  No. 3 Nebraska (5-0)  at Texas Tech (5-1)  Nebraska wins despite Texas Tech's good defense and passing game.</p>
        <p>FAR WEST  No. 10 U.C.L.A. (4-1)  at California (1-4)  Arizona State burned Cal for pass completions of 68, 54, 50 and 50 yards.  No. 11 Washington (4-1)  at Arizona State (4-1)  Last week, Arizona State rolled up 566 yards, Washington 504.</p>
        <p>Washington State (3-2)  at No. 15 Arizona (4-1)  Arizona's defense stopped Southern California with 10 yards rushing, 5 turnovers and 5 sacks.  Texas (3-2)  at Colorado (1-4)  Texas can't be as bad as it looked against Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>MISMATCHES  Duke (0-5)  at No. 6 Florida State (5-1)  After losing to Miami, Coach Bobby Bowden of Florida State said, ''We're 5-1 and we've still got half the season to play. There's too much out there to still play for.''  Maryland (2-3)  at No. 9 Clemson (6-0)  Clemson's offense could end with a 600-yard day.  TV: ESPN2, 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Rankings by the New York Times computer. All times are Eastern.</p>
