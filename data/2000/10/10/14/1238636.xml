        <p>In trying to describe New England in spiritual terms one is likely to evoke a place identified with a religious establishment, whether that be the Puritans of 350 years ago, their Congregationalist heirs or, most recently, such important Roman Catholic jurisdictions as the Archdiocese of Boston.</p>
        <p>But New England has also provided fertile soil for original thinkers, not a few of them women.</p>
        <p>Take, for example, Anne Hutchinson, a prophetess exiled from Massachusetts as a heretic in the 1630's; Mother Ann Lee, whose followers stumped the region for her millennialist movement, the Shakers, after the Revolution; Ellen Gould White, born in Portland, Me., a visionary crucial to the development of Seventh-day Adventism; and Mary Baker Eddy, who taught a system of belief about physical health and spiritual well-being called Christian Science.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Eddy, a New Hampshire native who spent half her life struggling with marital misfortune, poverty and near-invalidism, published the first edition of her book, ''Science and Health With Keys to the Scriptures,'' 125 years ago this month. She was 54, divorced and living in a boardinghouse in Lynn, Mass. She had also undergone an experience in which she said she had been healed of serious injuries after coming to understand that the Bible contained spiritual principles essential to health and life.</p>
        <p>Her book, after a slow start, has sold more than nine million copies. Teaching that an understanding of those spiritual laws that she discerned and disciplined prayer, rather than conventional medicine, lead to health, it provided the basis for the Church of Christ, Scientist.</p>
        <p>One could argue that the book is her monument.</p>
        <p>Still, the church has recently begun a project -- a museum and archives -- that its officials hope will bring the memory of Mrs. Eddy vividly back into the present, recounting her roles as religious leader, founder of a newspaper (The Christian Science Monitor) and a woman who achieved a renown rare in that era.</p>
        <p>The Christian Science board, whose five members govern the church, voted in June to go ahead with what will be called the Mary Baker Eddy Library for the Betterment of Humanity.</p>
        <p>When it opens in 2002, at a cost of $25 million, with an equal amount set aside for five years' worth of operating costs, it will house 500,000 documents by or about Mrs. Eddy, as well as a large collection of artifacts related to her, including her horse-drawn carriages.</p>
        <p>The museum will occupy 75,000 square feet in a building on the grounds of the church's international headquarters in the Back Bay section. The 14-acre grounds include three buildings designed by I.M. Pei, a reflecting pool and the imposing ''Mother Church'' of Christian Science.</p>
        <p>''The project grew out of a decade of thought,'' Virginia S. Harris, the board's chairwoman, said in an interview. She said the decision to create the library was one of several steps by the board in the 1990's, made in response to growing public interest in spirituality and in a spiritual dimension to health -- areas of discussion in which the church could participate.</p>
        <p>The decade has been a momentous one for the church. In 1992, the board shut down an ill-fated television venture, the Monitor Channel, which sustained losses estimated at $300 million.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the board introduced ''Science and Health'' into general bookstores, beginning a mass-marketing campaign. The book sold more than 200,000 copies during the church's most recent fiscal year.</p>
        <p>And in 1998, the board set up an exhibit on Mrs. Eddy's life at Women's Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls, N.Y., site of the first women's suffrage meeting. Interest in the exhibit helped convince the board to go ahead with the library, Mrs. Harris said.</p>
        <p>For a look at documents it will house, a church archivist took a visitor into a climate-controlled vault, donning white gloves to pick out letters by and to Mrs. Eddy, as well as one about her by President Theodore Roosevelt. Printing plates of the first edition of ''Science and Health,'' ready for the press, sat on a table.</p>
        <p>Later, Mrs. Harris and another board member, Walter D. Jones, showed the way around the library site, in a 70-year-old building highlighted by pink limestone panels and maple wood trim.</p>
        <p>For her ideas about health and Christianity, Mrs. Eddy was controversial in her time, inspiring either great devotion or denunciation. The discussion is not entirely past, given the evidence of recent books that take quite different views of her, including a biography that regards Mrs. Eddy as a feminist pioneer and a book that takes a negative view of her philosophy.</p>
        <p>In Mrs. Harris's view, the disparate views stem from Mrs. Eddy's challenges to the medical and theological authorities of her time. ''I think we find the controversies are far, far less today than they were during her lifetime,'' she added. ''Here was a woman writing about God and setting up churches, and she hadn't even gone to seminary.''</p>
