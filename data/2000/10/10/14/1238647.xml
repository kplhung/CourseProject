        <p>The noon prayers at Omar's Mosque on Getty Avenue ended about 2 o'clock. Afterward, hundreds of worshipers filed out, somber and grim-faced, and walked two blocks to the buses waiting to take them to the anti-Israel demonstration on Manhattan's East Side.</p>
        <p>The day before, it was Jews boarding buses, from places like Cedarhurst on Long Island, a hub of Orthodoxy and Zionism. They were headed to virtually the same spot, near the United Nations, to register their equally fervent anti-Palestinian sentiments.</p>
        <p>In these two communities, mirror images of each other, preoccupation with the Middle East violence is all but universal. There is similar anger and resentment in both ethnic enclaves about the bloodshed; similar anxiety about loved ones who are visiting or studying in the bitter battlegrounds of Jerusalem, Ramallah or Bethlehem.</p>
        <p>Here in Paterson, one of the largest Palestinian-American enclaves in the metropolitan region, militants in their 20's outside the mosque argued that final peace would never come until Israel leaves the West Bank and Gaza Strip, gives part of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians and allows refugees to resettle parts of their homeland. Older, less strident men lamented the loss of life on both sides and fretted about both the diminishing prospects for peace and the lack of a strong Arab-American political voice in Washington.</p>
        <p>''I've always believed that the  best way to solve this is through the peace process,'' said Awni Abu-Hadba, the owner of a jewelry store on Main Street and a leader of Paterson's Arab-American community. ''It might not give us much, but it's better than going to the zero point. Nobody needs to go back to the arms struggle and the killing, and that's probably where we are now.''</p>
        <p>Some 35 miles to the east in Cedarhurst, where observant Jews crowded the bakeries and kosher groceries in preparation for the Sabbath, hope was also fading for peace and deep seated anti-Arab sentiments were easily aroused.</p>
        <p>''Jews have always been the scapegoats throughout history,'' said Dr. Eli Greenberg. ''We worry about any terrorism attacks here in the United States. After seeing what happened to our Navy, how can you not worry?''</p>
        <p>Along Central Avenue in Cedarhurst, even the young are wise to the blood feuds on the other side of the world. ''This is getting out of hand,'' said Chaim Moskovic, 16. ''As much as I want peace, it seems the Palestinians are not going to give up.''</p>
        <p>Chaim, who lives in nearby Lawrence, went to Thursday's rally with friends, and said he was ''very proud of my people'' when he saw thousands of them rallying for Israel. He said that he knew at least 50  people studying in Israel and that he was fearful for them. But he added that he was eager to go there himself to ''show my solidarity.''</p>
        <p>Shoshana Seif, 16, also from Lawrence, paused while finishing a coffee on the patio outside Starbucks and talked about her 18-year-old sister, Dalia, who is studying in Jerusalem, a tradition among young Orthodox between their graduation from Jewish high schools and the start of college.</p>
        <p>''She told me it's scary,'' Ms. Seif said. ''She is not allowed to leave school. They can't travel. She has nowhere to go for the holiday, so the principal is taking people in.''</p>
        <p>Outside the Paterson mosque, Ranya Ismail, 26, talked about her pregnant sister, Iman, 19, who went to Ramallah a year ago to marry and now is trapped in a war zone.  ''She hears helicopters all the time,'' Ms. Ismail said. ''The mood is extremely dim. Everybody's worried. But at the same time she feels that whatever happens to her is what God wants.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ismail said she was eager to get to the rally on Second Avenue.  ''As a Palestinian-American and a Moslem, I have to show my support for my family and my people,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Farid el Asmar, a 54-year-old accountant in Paterson, said: ''We've been silent too many years. We never showed a lobby or a unity. We don't want to be silent anymore.'' He also said he doubted Yasir Arafat could control youthful Palestinians as long as Israeli troopers were shooting at them. ''The more they see the armored cars and the tanks and the rockets, they more they will continue to rise,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Paterson and nearby communities, the Arab-American population has grown to 50,000 from 5,000 in the last 30 years, about half Palestinian immigrants or their children, said Mr. Abu-Hadba, the jewelry store owner, making possible the rousing anti-Israel rally today.</p>
        <p>But the people here have no illusions that their cause is dear to the hearts of politicians, who turned out in force for the pro-Israel rally Thursday but stayed away today.  That is not to say, however, that the people are not trying to rouse interest. In recent days, for instance, Mr. Abu-Hadba and other community leaders sent letters and e-mail messages to President Clinton and New Jersey's United States senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert G. Torricelli.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abu-Hadba paraphrased part of the message: ''We don't want any more bloodshed. We don't want any more killing on either side.''</p>
        <p>But no one in Washington replied, he said. ''We know the Israeli lobby is strong,'' Mr. Abu-Hadba said. ''If these people do something the Israelis don't like, they won't be in office tomorrow. We know that.''</p>
