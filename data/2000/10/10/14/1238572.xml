        <p>Two-tenor bands -- small jazz groups with two tenor saxophones out front -- are a bit rare and special; with the overabundance of deep, rich sound onstage, there has to be a considerable difference in style between the saxophonists to make it work. The quartet led by the young bassist Chris Lightcap, which opened on Thursday night at the Knitting Factory's Old Office (74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa), has that distinction.</p>
        <p>The material the band played was straightforward. Mr. Lightcap is attracted to Ornette Coleman and the composer-performers who have splintered off from him; accordingly, some written themes were short, bright and songlike, and there were stretches in the music when meter and tonality became unfixed.</p>

        <p>Two-tenor bands -- small jazz groups with two tenor saxophones out front -- are a bit rare and special; with the overabundance of deep, rich sound onstage, there has to be a considerable difference in style between the saxophonists to make it work. The quartet led by the young bassist Chris Lightcap, which opened on Thursday night at the Knitting Factory's Old Office (74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa), has that distinction.</p>
        <p>The material the band played was straightforward. Mr. Lightcap is attracted to Ornette Coleman and the composer-performers who have splintered off from him; accordingly, some written themes were short, bright and songlike, and there were stretches in the music when meter and tonality became unfixed.</p>
        <p>But what made the band effective, even on vamp-based tunes, was the individuality of its two saxophonists. Bill McHenry settled around the middle register and played smooth, rounded notes, sounding in his serene chiming a bit like Stan Getz. It is a sound that not many tenor players, especially on the East Coast, have used since jazz became bristly, harmonically abstracted, 40 years ago. And next to him was Tony Malaby, who has a broad tone and a charged restlessness, closer in style to somebody like Joe Lovano, flipping back and forth between darting rhythmic-harmonic acuity and the split tones and surprise textural elements of free jazz.</p>
        <p>The band sounded much as it does on its first album, ''Lay-Up'' (Fresh Sound), released early this year. It included a tune by Mr. Coleman, ''I Heard It Over the Radio''; one by Carlos Ward, which sounded in the same vein; and some originals. Mr. Lightcap is one of the few musicians these days who has the breadth and inclination to divide his working life between what's called avant-jazz and the mainstream; he has a strong tone and good intonation, and with the drummer Gerald Cleaver he kept the waters active and choppy.</p>
        <p>The band used the theme-solos-theme format, but the saxophonists took advantage of the considerable space they were given, presenting their improvisations in sections. Mr. McHenry's were patient and narrative, working on one scale-based or textural idea at a time. Mr. Malaby's set up oppositions, improvising deliberately on the melodies with a swing feeling, and then turning up the heat, catapulting himself into gnashing long tones.</p>
        <p>These two players never came close to melting together: the difference between them remained distinct and fully engaging.</p>
        <p>The group finishes its run tonight.</p>
