        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she took ''full responsibility'' for her campaign's improper solicitation of political contributions last month, but insisted that it was unintentional and isolated and would not be repeated.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters here, and earlier in the day in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had provided her campaign with an official government list of 1,400 visitors to the White House that was used to solicit contributions for her Senate candidacy. Mrs. Clinton said five of the people on the list contributed a total of $225 to her campaign, and the money was being returned.</p>
        <p>''This was a mix-up,'' Mrs. Clinton said after speaking to about 150 people at the Autumnwood Senior Center here. ''I take full responsibility for it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said many of the names on the list were those of journalists who had attended functions at the White House. The issue came to light within her campaign, she said, when reporters called to inquire about solicitation letters they had received. If her intention had been to raise funds in an underhanded manner, she suggested, reporters would not have been tipped off in such an obvious way.</p>
        <p>''No campaign would deliberately solicit the press with any hope of any kind of return, so we moved to remedy that,'' Mrs. Clinton said in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent, said her use of government property for political purposes, no matter how tiny the return, was illegal. He said the activity fit a pattern of fund-raising improprieties, including the use of the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House by people who had contributed to Mrs. Clinton's campaign. In 1997, Congressional Republicans conducted an inquiry into President Clinton's fund-raising for his re-election campaign, contending that a White House database of names had been used by the president and the Democratic National Committee to solicit contributions. The Democrats denied the charges.</p>
        <p>''I think that they believe there are two laws -- one that applies to them and one that applies to the rest of us,'' Mr. Lazio said of the Clintons after visiting a high school near Syracuse. ''In this particular case, this isn't just something that is improper, this is something that is illegal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio suggested that Mrs. Clinton should be prosecuted, ''the same thing that happens when any of the rest of us commit a crime, if in fact that's what happened here.''</p>
        <p>His campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, issued an even harsher statement.</p>
        <p>''New Yorkers are disgusted by this abuse of the public trust,'' Mr. Dal Col said, ''and they will not elect a Senate candidate whose campaign has so brazenly broken the law in pursuit of campaign funds. What's next? Auctioning off the White House china or selling roses from the Rose Garden out on Pennsylvania Avenue?''</p>
        <p>Federal law generally forbids the use of government resources for overtly political purposes, but the lines are vague, and legal sanctions against candidates in such cases are unusual.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she did not consider the solicitations illegal and instead used words like ''error,'' ''misstep,'' ''mistake'' and ''mix-up'' to describe how the government list ended up in the hands of her campaign staff members.</p>
        <p>''The best I can tell you is that I have passed on names of people who have been involved in political activities,'' she said, ''supporting various candidates, events I have attended, or the president has attended, and there was a misstep and that list of names was included in what I passed on to the campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she did not regard the solicitations as an issue in the race, a position supported by some of the Buffalo residents who came to hear her speak today.</p>
        <p>''You tell me who is so clean that they have done nothing wrong in raising money,'' said Loretta Hurney, 71, adding that she intended to vote for Mrs. Clinton because of her promises to revive the upstate economy and protect Social Security and Medicare. ''They all take money from anybody.''</p>
        <p>During her news conference at the senior center, Mrs. Clinton said she was not put off by the rowdy reception she received Thursday during a rally in Manhattan in support of Israel. She was loudly booed by some in the crowd because of her previous statements of support for an independent Palestinian state. The rally was in response to the recent outbursts of violence in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she understood that ''feelings are extremely high,'' and she defended the attention she and Mr. Lazio have devoted to the Middle East in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>''This is a matter that has clear ramifications for the position of senator,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I see the responsibilities for Israel's security and for America's relationship with Israel, and our support for Israel, as central to what has to happen in our foreign policy in years to come.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she was not worried that her comments as a Senate candidate might be misconstrued or manipulated in the Middle East because she is also first lady.</p>
        <p>''For the first part of my campaign I was clearly wearing two hats,'' she said. ''I had continuing responsibilities I carried out not only with respect to the Middle East but with other issues because of my position as first lady. Clearly, in my mind, over time I have moved much more positively to demonstrate what I would do as a senator. And where I have disagreed, I have made those disagreements known. I think that is appropriate. And I believe that most people understand that I am now speaking for myself.''</p>
