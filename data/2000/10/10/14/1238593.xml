        <p>The European Commission officially approved the $34 billion acquisition of the Seagram Company by the French conglomerate Vivendi today after the companies promised concessions to dilute the power of their combined business, which will be a major force in entertainment and telecommunications.</p>
        <p>The commission's approval was the last regulatory obstacle to the merger, which was announced four months ago. Executives of both companies, anticipating an approval, had already begun a barnstorming effort to sell their concept to investors.</p>
        <p>Vivendi controls the Canal Plus pay-television company, a telephone company and the Havas publishing business. Seagram owns the Universal music and film studios. The combined company, to be called Vivendi Universal, creates an entertainment-telecommunications giant second in size only to the proposed combination of America Online and Time Warner Inc.</p>
        <p>To win the approval of the commission, Vivendi and Seagram promised to shed in the next two years a 23 percent stake that Vivendi holds in the British Sky Broadcasting group of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The companies also promised to allow competing distributors access to Universal music and to limit the number of Vivendi Universal films distributed through European outlets that the merged company will control.</p>
        <p>Vivendi's purchase of Seagram effectively ends the reign of Seagram's founding Bronfman family, although the family will remain the largest shareholder in the combined company. The Bronfmans rebuilt the company into a media player in the mid-1990's by acquiring Universal Pictures, which produced such American icons as ''The Sting'' and ''E.T.,'' and the Polygram music group, America's largest record company in terms of sales.</p>
        <p>At a news conference this evening, Vivendi's ebullient chairman and chief executive, Jean-Marie Messier, who will be chairman of the new group, said the combination would have assets of 63 billion euros, about $55 billion, by American accounting standards.</p>
        <p>The merger is a wager by Mr. Messier, 43, and the Seagram chairman, Edgar Bronfman Jr., that by combining popular entertainment with a powerful trans-Atlantic distribution system, most notably the next generation of wireless Internet services in Europe, they will create a company worth more combined than the value of its parts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Messier and Mr. Bronfman, who faced reporters tonight tieless and with open collars and perched atop bar stools in a Vivendi cybercafe just off the Champs-Elysees, had spent the last 48 hours with a team of about 40 top Vivendi and Seagram executives seeking to convince European investment analysts of the wisdom of their plan. Next week, they move their investors' roadshow to New York for a repeat performance.</p>
        <p>Numerous skeptics still think that Vivendi will have to struggle to benefit from the merger. Analysts who attended the meetings said they were more impressed with strategies for using Universal's film products and Polygram music and were less convinced of Vivendi's plans for enhancing distribution, which involve Vivendi's wireless phone network in France; an ambitious pan-European Internet portal called Vizzavi, which it owns jointly with Vodafone AirTouch; and the cable and pay television interests of Canal Plus.</p>
        <p>But Doug Morris, chairman and chief executive of the Universal Music Group, who will head the combined company's music activities, dismissed the naysayers. ''I think we'll get a lot back from this merger in many ways,'' he said today. Mr. Morris is one of three non-French executives on the team that will run the combined company's six operational units -- for film and television, music publishing, the Internet and phone business. The others are Barry Diller, the American television executive, and Frank Esser, a former executive of the Mannesmann telecommunications company of Germany, who will run the phone business.</p>
        <p>Financially, the new group will get off on a good footing. In July, Mr. Messier established an independent company to run Vivendi's traditional water distribution, waste management and construction businesses -- Vivendi began in the last century as Compagnie Generale des Eaux, essentially selling water to French municipalities -- and parked most of Vivendi's debt in the new company, in which Vivendi maintains a 72 percent stake.</p>
        <p>Moreover, under terms of the deal with Seagram, the new combination will sell Seagram's vast liquor business, owner of legendary brands like Chivas Regal whiskey and Martell cognac, and this week negotiations started with several bidding companies, including Allied Domecq of Britain. That sale, plus the divestiture of the BSkyB stake, which is worth at least $6 billion, Mr. Messier said, will more than erase Vivendi's debt.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say Mr. Messier may have to spend as much as $10 billion over the next several years to enable Vivendi to keep up in the wireless Internet portal revolution. Moreover, Vivendi will have to share an estimated $4.5 billion in start-up costs for Vizzavi over the next four years.</p>
        <p>Such uncertainties have caused Vivendi's share price to tumble since the deal was announced in June. But Mr. Messier defended the share performance, arguing that it had fallen only 4 percent since January, compared with a 10 percent drop in the Eurostoxx 50 index of blue-chip European shares, a 19 percent drop in European media shares and a 28 percent slump in telecommunications. Mr. Messier said the blame for much of Vivendi's weakness lay with arbitragers who sought to push down the stock so as to force Vivendi to pay out even more shares for Seagram to meet the arranged price.</p>
