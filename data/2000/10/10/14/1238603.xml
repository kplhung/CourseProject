        <p>Appropriately attired for the day in bolo ties, two cabinet secretaries came here today to announce a new program that is intended to make it easier for American Indians to secure mortgages.</p>
        <p>The two, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, insisted their visit was purely routine and nonpolitical, and said they had been planning it for almost nine months.</p>
        <p>But implicit in their message to two dozen Indian leaders and explicit in what several said they heard was a reminder that the Clinton administration has served them well and that a Gore administration would continue the same policies to help Indians share in the economic prosperity that has eluded them.</p>
        <p>''None of us knows how this is going to come out,'' Mr. Summers said of the presidential election in 26 days. ''But I can speak for Secretary Cuomo and myself that this administration has a commitment and each of us a responsibility to our departments, leaving an institution that is focused on these issues.''</p>
        <p>If clearly received and acted upon on Nov. 7, the message could play some role in determining which candidate -- Vice President Al Gore or Gov. George W. Bush of Texas -- wins New Mexico's five electoral votes. Home to some 65,000 Indians, about two-thirds of whom are old enough to vote, New Mexico is one of the few swing states in the Rocky Mountain West, and polls show the presidential race up for grabs.</p>
        <p>In that case, the Indian vote, which generally accounts for 3 to 4 percent of the turnout, could have a strong bearing on the outcome.</p>
        <p>''It's very much a tossup in the state right now,'' said F. Chris Garcia, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico. ''The Indian vote is quite small, but in a close election it could make a difference.''</p>
        <p>Some of the Indian leaders said they had grave concerns over who might win the White House. Raymond Gachupin, the tribal leader of the Jemez Pueblo, said Indian voters in New Mexico typically favor Democrats, but younger members of the tribe who may be more educated than their parents tend to vote on a candidate's position, rather than party.</p>
        <p>''We're very concerned about continuity after the Clinton administration,'' Mr. Gachupin said. ''Under President Clinton we have seen interest in Indian country, and we feel Vice President Gore has been very involved in this. So in a real sense, we're feeling that he would continue the momentum here.</p>
        <p>''But Bush is a real concern for us,'' Mr. Gachupin added. ''Some time ago he said Native American issues should be dealt with at the state level, rather than the federal level, and I know he changed his position now that he has more education. But for many of us, the first impression is the lasting impression.''</p>
        <p>Like Indians in other states, many of those living in New Mexico have suffered severe poverty, reflected in their crumbling houses and high unemployment rates.</p>
        <p>The 4,500 members of the Santo Domingo Pueblo are typical. Living on 102 square miles of windblown scrub desert between Albuquerque and Santa Fe, they have a per capita annual income of $5,217, well below the poverty level, and an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent, compared with 3.9 for the nation as a whole.  Their principle sources of income have remained the same for centuries, through ranching, farming and jewelry making.</p>
        <p>One of their lingering problems has been adequate housing, with many houses too old to rehabilitate and many accommodating several families. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Summers today walked through one house in the village that Indian leaders said was built 600 years ago and was occupied as recently as 1997.</p>
        <p>As part of a larger initiative to build homes and increase homeownership in poor areas, the Clinton administration has helped the tribes through a variety of housing and lending programs, and today's announcement was the latest, a way for Indians to cut through red tape to secure a mortgage and gain access to capital more easily. While a record 67 percent of all Americans now own their own homes, barely a third of Indians do.</p>
        <p>In his remarks to the Indian leaders, Mr. Summers gave partial credit for the success of one program benefiting Indians to two leading Republicans, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>''And I can assure you,'' Mr. Summers said, ''if this had been a political trip, I would not have mentioned them.''</p>
