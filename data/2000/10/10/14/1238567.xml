        <p>Wolfgang Sawallisch's concerts with the Philadelphia Orchestra have typically had a sense of Germanic propriety: everything is in place, yet the music-making can seem safe or even stolid. But at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening, Mr. Sawallisch and his players sounded unusually youthful and vigorous, perhaps because they played a program that demanded as much.</p>
        <p>The curtain raiser was Kevin Beavers's three-movement Sinfonia, a work that was heard during the new music week at Tanglewood in 1997 and won a competition held by the Philadelphia Orchestra last season. Mr. Beavers is not afraid to ask an orchestra to make noise, and he begins his Sinfonia with a blaring, dissonant chord that gradually dissolves into a slow-moving, mostly portentous movement, with an occasional moment of lightness: for example, a jazzy section with gracefully bending string lines.</p>

        <p>Wolfgang Sawallisch's concerts with the Philadelphia Orchestra have typically had a sense of Germanic propriety: everything is in place, yet the music-making can seem safe or even stolid. But at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening, Mr. Sawallisch and his players sounded unusually youthful and vigorous, perhaps because they played a program that demanded as much.</p>
        <p>The curtain raiser was Kevin Beavers's three-movement Sinfonia, a work that was heard during the new music week at Tanglewood in 1997 and won a competition held by the Philadelphia Orchestra last season. Mr. Beavers is not afraid to ask an orchestra to make noise, and he begins his Sinfonia with a blaring, dissonant chord that gradually dissolves into a slow-moving, mostly portentous movement, with an occasional moment of lightness: for example, a jazzy section with gracefully bending string lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beavers's central movement, ''Winter Moon,'' is pure tone painting: the crescent moon described in the Langston Hughes poem that inspired him is drawn by dissonant winds that evoke an unforgiving iciness. And the finale, ''Chatterbox,'' borrows a page or two, in terms of instrumentation and snappy rhythms, from ''West Side Story'' before making its way through a variety of jazz idioms and ending somewhere in the big-band era.</p>
        <p>The orchestra set out gamely on this eclectic voyage, taking it up on its invitation to produce a big, powerful sound.</p>
        <p>It then settled into a breezy, crisp account of Stravinsky's Symphony in C, part of a season-long retrospective of the composer's works by Carnegie Hall. During the period that the work was composed, from 1938 to 1940, Stravinsky's daughter, wife and mother died and World War II began, but nothing in the music suggests there was a cloud in his sky. It burbles along cheerily, affording some lovely moments for an ensemble's first chair string, wind and brass players, all executed beautifully here.</p>
        <p>After the intermission, Mr. Sawallisch and company offered hefty support for a performance of the Brahms Violin Concerto in which Hilary Hahn was the soloist. Ms. Hahn's sound is thoroughly modern -- streamlined, tightly focused and flexible.</p>
        <p>It is also carefully controlled: Ms. Hahn can make her violin sound achingly sweet, tender and lyrical, as well as forceful and grandly dramatic, and she moves easily between those extremes. The Brahms asks all this of a violinist, and Ms. Hahn did not squander her opportunities.</p>
