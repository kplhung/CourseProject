        <p>The most influential critics of gangsta rap aren't writing articles or holding Senate hearings. They're rapping themselves, determined to redefine real hip-hop as something more expansive, intelligent and uplifting than the current best-selling cliches of gunplay and raunch.</p>
        <p>The Roots, from Philadelphia, have spent a decade sidestepping hip-hop routines. With their Okayplayer Tour (named after their Web site and fan base), which came to the Hammerstein Ballroom last Saturday night, they set out to remake hip-hop in performance as well as in substance. It was a groundbreaking concert and a nonstop celebration of hip-hop's abundance.</p>
        <p>From their beginnings a decade ago, the Roots have used live musicians instead of a disc jockey. Ahmir Questlove Thompson, on drums, steers the band, and it now alludes to a broad swath of music: funk, jazz, soul, gospel and more. For the Okayplayer Tour, the Roots share the band with the other performers on the bill: the rappers Talib Kweli, Dead Prez, Dice Raw, Bahamadia, Flo Brown and H2O, as well as the singer Jaguar and the vocal duo the Jazzyfatnastees. (Rah Digga and Slum Village, who are also part of the tour, did not perform last Saturday.) Most of the women on the tour have honed their songs at Black Lily, a women's showcase and workshop organized by the Roots, who have no use for standard hip-hop machismo.</p>
        <p>Instead of separate sets leading up to a headliner, the Okayplayer Tour is a revue. On Saturday, the Roots started the concert, and performers came and went throughout an unbroken set that lasted more than two hours. It was a show of unity and shared purpose, exchanging hip-hop's competitive aura for cooperation. The songs insisted that the Okayplayers' competition came not from one another but from phony, bandwagon-jumping gangsters and pernicious ideas. The Roots expected their fans -- a collegiate, integrated full house -- to listen to the words as they danced.</p>
        <p>But there was no party line, and plenty of variety. The Roots, led by the rapper Black Thought and sometimes joined by Dice Raw, interspersed extravagant boasts with calls to start ''the next movement,'' while the band played vamps that shifted from quasi-classical sobriety to jazzy swing. In ''Water,'' a song from Black Thought's coming solo album, he tore into the psychology of addiction and the pressures that lead to it. Mr. Kweli, the concert's most vehement and crowd-pleasing performer, went for wholehearted consciousness-raising, mocking imitative gangsta rappers as ''softer than mashed potatoes'' and insisting, ''The most important time in history is now.''</p>
        <p>Dead Prez, the duo of Stic and M1, rapped about education as brainwashing, maintaining an African heritage, eating healthfully and ''mind sex,'' which insisted that they were interested in conversation and ''a game of chess on the futon'' before making love. Bahamadia, who calmly delivers torrents of words, rapped about women struggling to make ends meet; she got a wave of applause when she dedicated ''Commonwealth (Cheap Chicks)'' to college students along with welfare recipients and single mothers. The band turned in a credible live version of drum-and-bass electronica when she rapped ''New Forms,'' then segued into John Coltrane's ''Giant Steps.''</p>
        <p>Flo Brown, who raps in a high, cutting voice, tore into gangsta machismo and compared the flow of her rap to cosmic forces. She also reappeared alongside Jaguar, a singer with a huge, gospel-charged voice, to share a song that put down a female rival. The Jazzyfatnastees gently harmonized a soul ballad about an undeserving man, and reappeared to sing choruses behind Mr. Kweli and the Roots. An unannounced guest, Erykah Badu, cooed her own ''Bag Lady'' and lent siren wails to the Roots' ''You Got Me.''</p>
        <p>The finale, with everyone onstage, was Dead Prez's ''Hip-Hop,'' once more posing a choice between commercialism and conscience. The sold-out audience, shouting along with hands in the air, promised that it was possible to have both at once.</p>
