        <p>Clinton Orders an Auction Of Underused Airwaves  With growing congestion of the airwaves threatening the development of a new generation of hand-held wireless devices, President Clinton ordered the government to review and then auction wide swaths of the spectrum now controlled by government agencies, as well as by private companies.</p>
        <p>The review is expected to lead to a fundamental reshuffling of how the spectrum is used and culminate in a huge auction in 2002 to award new licenses for companies to sell services like wireless telephones offering high-speed Internet connections. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Ovitz Company Files For Bankruptcy  Scour, the Los Angeles company that abets the trading of music and movies over the Internet, has filed for bankruptcy protection, a move the company said could shelter it from copyright infringement lawsuits it faces from record companies and movie studios. Scour, which is backed by Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood agent and former Walt Disney president, filed in Los Angeles for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 on Thursday. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Approval for Seagram-Vivendi Deal  The European Commission officially approved the $34 billion acquisition of Seagram by the French conglomerate Vivendi after the companies promised concessions to dilute the power of their combined business, which will be a major force in entertainment and telecommunications. The commission's approval was the last regulatory obstacle to the merger, which was announced four months ago. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Officials Track Bioengineered Corn  Efforts to trace shipments of a bioengineered corn unapproved for human consumption have raised concern among food and grain industry officials that the corn, already discovered in two brands of grocery products, may have made its way more widely into production channels for the nation's food supply. Millions of bushels of the unapproved corn, known as StarLink, have been delivered to more than 350 grain elevators around the country. Government and industry officials are now pushing the operators to test their supplies for evidence of contamination. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Pacific Century Deal Revamped  Pacific Century CyberWorks announced that it had accepted reduced terms in its joint venture with Australia's state telephone company, Telstra, to reflect a more than 60 percent decline in Pacific Century's share price. Telstra will still inject $2.4 billion into Pacific Century. But now Telstra will take majority control of the cellular operations that Pacific Century acquired in its $38 billion takeover of Hong Kong's telephone company. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Crude Oil Prices Ease After Surge  Despite escalating violence in the Middle East, energy analysts said that supplies of oil appeared secure and that crude prices were unlikely to bounce much higher after a surge of nearly $3 a barrel on Thursday. The benchmark contract, for November crude, closed at $34.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down $1.07.</p>
        <p>Federated to Cut Jobs at Fingerhut  Federated Department Stores said that it would cut 550 jobs from Fingerhut, its electronic retailing unit to save $40 million annually. The cuts represent about one-quarter of the 2,300 positions at Fingerhut's offices in Minnetonka, Minn.; its data center in Plymouth, Minn.; and its e-commerce operation in Edina, Minn. Federated, operator of the Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores, bought Fingerhut in March 1999. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Imax Cancels Plans to Sell Itself  Imax, the Canadian designer of giant movie screens and high-technology sound systems, canceled plans to sell itself after the price of its shares dropped 70 percent on Thursday on a warning that third-quarter results would be lower than expected.
