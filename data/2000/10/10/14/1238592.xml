        <p>Facing the start of his trial in four days, a Miami nightclub owner pleaded guilty yesterday to committing murder and armed robbery in the service of a violent Brooklyn Mafia crew.</p>
        <p>The nightclub owner, Chris Paciello, 29, was scheduled to go on trial Tuesday for robbing $300,000 from a Chemical Bank in Staten Island in 1992 and, one year later, driving the getaway car in a botched break-in that ended with the death of a Staten Island woman, Judith Shemtov.</p>

        <p>Facing the start of his trial in four days, a Miami nightclub owner pleaded guilty yesterday to committing murder and armed robbery in the service of a violent Brooklyn Mafia crew.</p>
        <p>The nightclub owner, Chris Paciello, 29, was scheduled to go on trial Tuesday for robbing $300,000 from a Chemical Bank in Staten Island in 1992 and, one year later, driving the getaway car in a botched break-in that ended with the death of a Staten Island woman, Judith Shemtov.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, dressed in a simple black suit, Mr. Paciello stood up in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and pleaded guilty to the charges -- the very accusations that he had denied since he turned himself into the authorities in Miami in November 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paciello's guilty plea put to rest months of sparring with federal prosecutors who have said from the start of the case that he was linked to the Bath Avenue crew -- a cadre of vicious street thugs who worked under the aegis of the Bonanno crime family.</p>
        <p>Three other members of the crew, Thomas Reynolds, Joseph Benanti and Fabrizio DeFrancisci, pleaded guilty to separate crimes under the same sprawling racketeering indictment last month. The only man named in the original indictment who is still facing trial in the case is Anthony Spero, whom prosecutors describe as the consigliere, or counsel, of the Bonanno family and the leader of the Bath Avenue crew. His trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 11.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paciello, who was born in Brooklyn and raised in Staten Island, moved to Miami in 1993. He eventually owned a string of trendy restaurants and nightclubs there and was often seen in the company of beautiful women and celebrities like Madonna. While the government contends that Mr. Paciello never shed his ties to the mob during his time in Miami Beach, his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he had managed to reinvent himself down South.</p>
        <p>''The saddest part of this case,'' Mr. Brafman said outside court yesterday, ''is that the Chris Paciello who is going to be sentenced is a far different person than the Chris Paciello who committed these crimes 10 years ago. He has felt remorse about the tragic death of Mrs. Shemtov from the moment it happened.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Paciello faces a sentence of 27 to 33 years in prison, said Jim Walden, the lead prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walden, who has now won guilty pleas from nearly 20 people in the case, also called Mrs. Shemtov's death a tragedy. He said the investigation into the Bath Avenue crew and the Bonanno family would continue.</p>
