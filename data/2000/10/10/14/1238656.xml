        <p>THERE is a certain pep to the step of the candidate wearing the warm-pink blazer and black leather heels at this midmorning gubernatorial debate inside a half-filled, sleepy college auditorium. But the race is not given to the swift.</p>
        <p>The candidate, Heidi Heitkamp, knows that. Two weeks after having her right breast and some surrounding lymph nodes removed because of cancer, the Democratic nominee for North Dakota governor, the candidate with the bouquet of red hair, is back on the campaign trail, edging toward fever pitch.</p>
        <p>Yet, whispers about her health surround her candidacy. They have filtered in from the streets of Bismarck and the endless farm fields in this northern Plains state to Ms. Heitkamp's headquarters.</p>
        <p>Some residents seem to be wondering, if not casting seeds of doubt, about whether Ms. Heitkamp's cancer, the surgery and the coming chemotherapy and radiation treatments would keep her from performing the job, should she be elected on Nov. 7. Might the treatments even cause her to lose her ''big red hair,'' which has become so recognizable across the state?</p>
        <p>Fall out it may, says Ms. Heitkamp, 44. But, ''I'm not going to stop living my life,'' she said in a postdebate interview. ''And so we roll the dice and see how it goes. I don't intend to lose my hair. I probably have enough to take care of the free world.''</p>
        <p>Have no doubt. The woman is running, almost literally. She hurried off the stage at the conclusion of the debate on Thursday at Bismarck State College. Ms. Heitkamp, the twice-elected state attorney general, is in a close contest against the Republican gubernatorial nominee, John Hoeven. Mr. Hoeven, the former president of the Bank of North Dakota, has been all but christened the next governor by Gov. Ed Schafer, a Republican leaving office after two terms. But the race is hardly over.</p>
        <p>A poll conducted this month by The Forum, a Fargo newspaper, found that Ms. Heitkamp was leading Mr. Hoeven by six percentage points. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Her opponent says Ms. Heitkamp is faring well in the polls because of the publicity from her announcement on Sept. 20 that she had cancer.</p>
        <p>But people told the pollsters that Ms. Heitkamp's illness would not affect their votes.</p>
        <p>''I think anybody who would say that is looking for some kind of crutch,'' Ms. Heitkamp said of Mr. Hoeven's comment.</p>
        <p>Any trace of doubt Ms. Heitkamp had about  staying in the campaign after learning that she had cancer was squelched by her daughter, Ali, 14, a freshman on her high school swim team, who rises at 5:30 every morning for practice.</p>
        <p>''She looked at me, and she said, 'Mom, you aren't going to quit running for governor are you?' She said, 'You've worked so hard.' She said, 'It would be like getting out of the pool before the last leg of the 100.' She said, 'You've got to finish.' ''</p>
        <p>But the battle is not given to the strong.</p>
        <p>No sooner does Ms. Heitkamp step off the stage after the debate than a reporter puts a microphone in her face for an interview. She fields the questions, animated and smiling, poised to move in a different direction as quickly as the next campaign chore calls. This does not seem like work for Ms. Heitkamp, but revival, an exchange of spiritual energy.</p>
        <p>HER supporters wait in the wings for a chance to meet and greet. Ms. Heitkamp shakes hands, fields a kiss. Then she checks in with her campaign crew for the rest of the day's busy schedule:  a noon lunch appointment with the Fraternal Order of Police, a  board meeting, a 180-mile drive east to Fargo, a doctor's appointment. Suddenly, a photographer asks if he can tag along to the doctor's office.</p>
        <p>''Heck, you can come if you want,'' Ms. Heitkamp said,  laughing. ''I don't have any more secrets.'' She later clarifies. ''I'm not into hiding anything, except my weight,'' she said.</p>
        <p>About a week after announcing  she had cancer, she had surgery. A week after that, she resumed campaigning.</p>
        <p>Even as she campaigned this week, she made plans to release hospital records about her treatment and condition to a local newspaper reporter. She is scheduled to begin chemotherapy next week, less than three weeks before the election. But it is business as usual.</p>
        <p>After a chef's salad with chicken strips, no olives, a bowl of ranch dressing on the side, a Diet Coke and about an hour's worth of lunch conversation with two officers from the police union, which she is not sure will endorse her, Ms. Heitkamp is off again. This time she goes to her office in the Capitol, where she signs correspondence, flips through papers and talks with staff members, doling out orders in between. Among the business letters are get-well cards, now totaling about 1,000. There is one that when opened plays the Spinners' song ''I'll be around.''</p>
        <p>''Whenever you call, me I'll be there,'' the song says. She plays it for Denise Lawson, her campaign manager.</p>
        <p>''Chicks like this better than boys,'' Ms. Heitkamp says, laughing. Throughout the rest of the day, the tune lingers with her. It spills out in a hum.</p>
        <p>Finally, Ms. Heitkamp drives home, to a big-frame house on a wooded lot that backs to the Missouri River. She is there long enough to change clothes and kiss her son, Nathan, 10, and Ali goodbye as she heads for more campaigning. Her husband, Darwin Lange, a family doctor, is cooking dinner as the minivan pulls out of the driveway.</p>
        <p>''I think we've got the edge right now,'' Ms. Heitkamp says. ''It's going to come down to the voters in the end.''</p>
