        <p>Navy Sets Death Toll at 17 After Search for Missing  The Navy said 17 sailors had died and 38 were wounded in the blast on the destroyer Cole in a Yemen harbor. The announcement came after Navy divers spent the day searching for missing crew members and evidence. There were reports of Islamic groups claiming responsibility, but they could not be verified and American officials said their investigation had yielded no firm leads.</p>

        <p>Bush Cautiously Raises Mideast as Campaign Issue  Gov. George W. Bush continued to express support for the Clinton administration's approach to increased violence in the Middle East. But he and his running mate, Dick Cheney, also signaled that they were prepared to make events in the Middle East a part of the campaign debate, finding ways to frame recent events there as an argument for their election and a validation of their positions on oil imports, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the strength and use of the military.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore canceled a meeting with 30 to 40 Arab-Americans in Detroit to return to Washington for a White House meeting on the Middle East. Aides said that the cancellation was logistical, not political, that the meeting would be rescheduled and that Mr. Gore would meet later in the day in Washington with several of those who were to have attended the Detroit session.</p>

        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman visited El Flaco, one of the poor Texas shantytowns along the Rio Grande inhabited mainly by Mexican immigrants, and accused Governor Bush of ''failed leadership'' for not improving conditions in the ''colonias.''</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Governor Bush raised $125 million in six months for the Republican National Committee, more than twice the $60 million that Vice President Gore raised for the Democratic National Committee. Both parties shattered quarterly fund-raising levels for this stage in a presidential campaign. In the last three calendar months, the Republicans raised $101 million and had $45 million left; the Democrats raised $55 million and had $26 million left.</p>

        <p>F.A.A. Said to Turn Blind Eye  The F.A.A. has avoided evidence that nuts and bolts used in making airplanes are frequently substandard, the inspector general of the Transportation Department said in an audit. Investigators concluded that the failure to react appropriately to warnings of safety ''suggests a systemic weakness in F.A.A.'s process to evaluate safety issues brought to the agency's attention.''</p>

        <p>Long Island Tanker Fire Is Linked to Old Defect  Federal safety investigators say a fiery gasoline tanker accident that killed a Suffolk County woman last month may have been caused by a common safety problem with tankers pinpointed more than a decade ago but still not corrected. Federal investigators emphasized that their findings were preliminary.</p>

        <p>First Lady Admits Lapse  Hillary Rodham Clinton accepted ''full responsibility'' for her campaign's improper solicitation of political donations from people whose names were on a list of White House visitors, but she asserted that the action had been unintentional and isolated and would not be repeated. Her opponent in the Senate race, Rick A. Lazio, said use of the list was illegal and fit a pattern of impropriety.</p>

        <p>Fast-Track Certification  Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy will expand almost tenfold a fledgling program that offers novices a crash course in teaching and grants them an alternative form of certification. The move was prompted by a state-imposed deadline to get thousands of uncertified teachers out of New York City classrooms.</p>

        <p>New Bandwidth Prospects  President Clinton ordered the government to review and then auction wide swaths of the spectrum of airwaves controlled by government agencies, as well as by private companies. The action could lead to a fundamental reshuffling of how the spectrum is used and culminate in a huge auction in 2002 to award new licenses for companies to sell services like wireless telephones offering high-speed Internet connections.</p>

        <p>Stocks Stage Big Rally  The Nasdaq surged 242.09 points, or 7.9 percent, to 3,316.77; the S.&amp; P. 500 climbed 44.39, or 3.3 percent, to 1,374.17; and the Dow jumped 157.60 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,192.18. But it was not enough to pull the three major averages back into positive territory for the year.</p>
