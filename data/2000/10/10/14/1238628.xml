        <p>As New York anticipates the possibility of a Subway Series this year, I remember the autumns of a half century ago, when the city was never finer.

        <p>As New York anticipates the possibility of a Subway Series this year, I remember the autumns of a half century ago, when the city was never finer. Back then, as the days crispened and the sky turned marble blue, we had our own World Series right here in town. Let the rest of the country turn to football or fox hunting. The Brooklyn Dodgers, the New York Giants and the New York Yankees ruled baseball and, in our minds, ruled the world.</p>
        <p>From 1947 through 1956, New York City's baseball teams won the World Series nine times. If natives of the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, and Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn agreed on anything, it was this: Nine out of ten ain't bad. In a term coined by the cartoonist Willard Mullin, these were the Subway Series.</p>
        <p>New York teams ruled, but nobody rooted generically. It seemed emotionally impossible to root for more than one of the city's teams. And the close-to-home rivalry heightened the passion. It was during these years, with so much at stake and so much to care about, that New York became the baseball town it aspires to be today.</p>
        <p>Arguably, the Dodgers were the most significant of the clubs. They integrated major league baseball and, in a sense, the country, with Jackie Robinson. It was my good fortune as a young newspaperman to travel with Robinson and Pee Wee Reese, a white shortstop out of Louisville, and watch racial barrier after barrier fall.</p>
        <p>Each team had a distinct personality. The Giants, I was assured by Jimmy Cannon, a sports columnist and native Manhattanite, were the real New York team, dating back to the storied days of Christy Mathewson and John McGraw. ''The Yankees,'' Cannon announced, ''are strictly for tourists.'' The Dodgers were open, gabby, indiscreet. ''The fans in Brooklyn are the worst fans in baseball,'' Duke Snider, the team's slugger, told me one night, ''and I want you to put that in the paper.''</p>
        <p>The Giants were a remade team after Leo Durocher, a semi-reformed pool hustler, took over as manager in 1948 and said: ''We gotta get rid of most of these guys. Back up the truck. I'm gonna build my kind of team.'' And he did, developing players like Bobby Thomson, who hit the most famous home run ever in 1951, and Willie Mays, after he had been spurned by racist scouts for the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, generally regarded as cold and corporate, startled New York by hiring Casey Stengel to manage the team in 1949. ''What do you think of him?'' Joe DiMaggio asked Arthur Daley, the New York Times columnist, during spring training.</p>
        <p>''I never saw such a bewildered guy in my life,'' Daley said.</p>
        <p>DiMaggio agreed. But Stengel's Yankees won every World Series from 1949 through 1953, and the old humorous character gave way to a new persona: Field Marshal Casey von Stengel.</p>
        <p>Memory summons scenes past forgetting: The mightiest of teams, the Dodgers and Yankees of 1952, wrestling through a seven-game World Series. The Yankees winning when an obscure left-hander named Bob Kuzava set down in order the last eight Dodger batters. Brooklyn winning its only World Series ever in 1955, with Johnny Podres's seventh-game shutout and a fine outfield catch by Sandy Amoros. Don Larsen throwing a perfect game on Oct. 8, 1956.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, after the 1957 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants disappeared. Greed and California gold drew them west. Wreckers pounded Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds to dust. The Flavian Amphitheater still stands in Rome, but Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds are gone.</p>
        <p>So, for a long time, was the Subway Series. Most New Yorkers never stopped loving baseball, but, inevitably, their intensity waned.</p>
        <p>Despite the sirens of publicity, instant tradition implants don't work, at least for me. It will be some years before the Yankees and the Mets can match the extended, contentious rivalries of long ago, or stimulate the same passions.</p>
        <p>But if these two New York teams make it, Subway Series 2000 has the promise of a wonderful beginning. As a New Yorker I'll regret only that Maglie, Stengel, Pee Wee, Jackie, Mickey and Leo can't be on hand to watch the games, then talk about them deep into the night.</p>
