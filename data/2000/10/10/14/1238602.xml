        <p>What the Islanders need tonight, Coach Butch Goring said, is some good home cooking.</p>
        <p>''We weren't very successful at home last year, but it's a different year and there are a lot of new guys who weren't around,'' Goring said as the 0-1-1-0 Islanders prepared for tonight's home opener at Nassau Coliseum against the Calgary Flames. The Islanders went 10-26-5-1 at home last season. ''We don't want teams to want to come here and play us. We want to play with intensity and not be nice to play against.</p>
        <p>''I don't think emotion is going to be a problem in the home opener -- you get pretty jazzed up for that.''</p>
        <p>Islanders fans have been jazzed up for the home opener ever since the team's new owners, Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar of Computer Associates, bought the team in April. Buoyed by the millions of dollars spent upgrading the roster back to National Hockey League levels -- the payroll has risen to $26 million from $15.5 million -- and a commitment to upgrading the aging Coliseum, fans have responded by buying tickets at a clip not seen in years.</p>
        <p>Including season-ticket sales, which are up to 6,000 from just 3,500, about 14,000 tickets have already been sold for tonight's game against a yawner of an opponent. In last year's home opener, 14,523 were on hand to watch as the Islanders defeated the far more interesting Colorado Avalanche, 4-2.</p>
        <p>But will near sellouts be the norm for this season's Islanders? Even with the improvements to the Coliseum, which include a new locker room and training facilities for the team, and a new roof for the fans who had to sit under the leaking old one, it has been a long time since the Coliseum was known as Fort Neverlose. Last season, the Islanders played all too frequently to crowds of fewer than 5,000, and their paid attendance averaged fewer than 10,000 in the 16,297-seat building. The only guaranteed sellouts came against the Rangers.</p>
        <p>Tonight's game could be the start of something, if not big, then certainly a little bigger than last season in terms of crowd size. A truer test will come next Tuesday, when the Islanders play host to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks in the second of four home games this month, with the others on Oct. 27 against the Montreal Canadiens and on Oct. 31 against the Boston Bruins.</p>
        <p>''It will be nice to get our first home game in,'' said forward Brad Isbister, who scored 22 goals in his first year with the Islanders last season, becoming a crowd favorite. ''It's definitely going to be exciting. We're looking forward to showing the fans this team. It's only been two games, but we're still growing, and I think we'll continue to grow.''</p>
        <p>Isbister, although he is a relative newcomer, ranks among the more familiar faces on the Islanders. Over the summer, the team added six high-caliber new skaters -- the veteran defensemen Roman Hamrlik, Garry Galley and Kevin Haller, and forwards Mark Parrish, Mike Stapleton and Oleg Kvasha -- in addition to goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck.</p>
        <p>The new players, particularly the defensemen, are being counted on to bring some leadership as well as experience to the Islanders, who last season were among the youngest teams in the N.H.L. (25.8 years) and finished 27 points out of the final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference. This season, nothing less than making a run at the playoffs will be acceptable, to the team's new owners, the fans and the players.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone has to lead to a certain extent and have accountability,'' said Galley, entering his 17th N.H.L. season. ''You need all different kinds. You're not looking for two or three guys to step up, but a whole variety to have a team success. I believe we can do that.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The new Islanders owners, CHARLES WANG and SANJAY KUMAR, will take part in a ceremonial face-off before tonight's game. . . . The Islander with the most tenure is the captain, KENNY JONSSON, who signed with the team on March 13, 1996. CLAUDE LAPOINTE and STEVE WEBB signed later that year.</p>
