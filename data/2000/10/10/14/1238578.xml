        <p>The Yugoslav foreign minister, a loyalist to the ousted Slobodan Milosevic, quit today as the new president, Vojislav Kostunica, pursued a steady but scarcely sweeping campaign to assert his authority.</p>
        <p>Foreign Ministry officials said the minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, went to his Belgrade office, collected his things, said goodbye to a few aides and walked out. Mr. Jovanovic's departure was another sign of the haphazard way authority is shifting in this country.</p>
        <p>A week after Mr. Milosevic resigned in the face of a popular uprising, Mr. Kostunica is still battling to take the reins of power. His approach is slow and steady, setting him at odds with Zoran Djindjic, his main ally in bringing democratic change and a man more inclined to move fast in seizing authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic, now in theory a private citizen with no more rights than any other Yugoslav, sits in a state villa in the exclusive Belgrade neighborhood of Dedinje protected by soldiers. A member of his Serbian Socialist Party, Nikola Sainovic, said today that he was in daily contact with Mr. Milosevic over policy decisions.</p>
        <p>The country's top military commander, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, long a staunch ally of Mr. Milosevic, remains at the head of the army. While Mr. Djindjic favors moving swiftly to remove Mr. Milosevic from political life and oust General Pavkovic, Mr. Kostunica is more inclined to caution, officials close to Mr. Djindjic and Mr. Kostunica said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djindjic has a stronger political base than the new president in his Democratic Party, but Mr. Kostunica, whose Democratic Party of Serbia is tiny, has won enormous authority through heading the campaign that overthrew Mr. Milosevic. In practice, the two men need each other, although further tensions appear certain to flare.</p>
        <p>Western governments, eager to consolidate a long-awaited democratic change, are concerned that Mr. Kostunica not lose the political momentum he now has through hesitation, officials said. Mr. Kostunica is to travel to Biarritz, France, on Saturday to meet European Union ministers, who are eager to demonstrate their support for what they call ''Serbia's return to Europe.''</p>
        <p>In the delicate political conditions set by a transfer of power that is by no means complete, negotiations continued today between Mr. Kostunica's supporters and Mr. Milosevic's party over two central issues: the setting of a date for elections in the Serbian republic and the formation of an interim Serbian government until then.</p>
        <p>Serbia is by far the larger constituent part of what is left of Yugoslavia, and its government runs an 85,000-strong police force that was one pillar of Mr. Milosevic's authority. The former president's party is the largest in the Serbian parliament and controls several of the government ministries.</p>
        <p>After talks today, Vladan Batic, a supporter of Mr. Kostunica, said an agreement had been reached to hold Serbian elections on Dec. 24. Until then, Mr. Batic said, an accord has been fashioned to share control of the most important Serbian ministries between the Socialists and the bloc of parties that propelled Mr. Kostunica to victory.</p>
        <p>But the Socialists did not confirm the election date, previously rumored to be Dec. 17, and it was not immediately clear how power-sharing would work between politicians with diametrically opposing views. Mr. Sainovic, of the Socialist Party, said only that ''conditions have been created to lead to an agreement on a Serbian government.''</p>
        <p>In practice, the Socialists have to show some flexibility or face the possibility of another outburst of popular ire. But there is little question that Mr. Kostunica's decision to compromise with Mr. Milosevic for now has given the party some breathing space.</p>
        <p>The president is also moving slowly to form a federal Yugoslav government. A central difficulty is the uneasy relationship between Belgrade and the other Yugoslav republic, Montenegro.</p>
        <p>Milo Djukanovic, the president of Montenegro, has congratulated Mr. Kostunica on his victory, but has given no indication that the situation in Serbia will change a central thrust of his policy, which has been to try to create the conditions for the possibility of Montenegro's independence.</p>
        <p>As the price for his cooperation, Mr. Djukanovic is known to want sweeping changes in the Yugoslav Army because of its aggressive stance in recent years in Montenegro. But it is precisely such changes that Mr. Kostunica seems reluctant to make because of his overriding concern with stability.</p>
