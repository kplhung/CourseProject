        <p>All looked right with the world when two ebullient young women in pink tutus bounced out at the start of the program by Julio Bocca and his Ballet Argentino on Wednesday night at City Center. True, Mr. Bocca has no more luck than the next company director finding choreography as good as the dancers, to judge from  some of the dances on the program. But the freshness and spirit of this 10-year-old company are irresistible. And with the leavening of sensuous charisma offered by Mr. Bocca, a seasoned international ballet star, the evening was a happy one.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece was Ana Maria Stekelman's ''Piazzolla Tango Vivo,'' a suite of dances performed to music by the tango master Astor Piazzolla. The score was performed live -- and with delicious clarity and passion -- by the Fundacion Astor Piazzolla Quintet, whose conductor, Fernando Suarez Paz, accompanied Piazzolla for over a decade.</p>

        <p>All looked right with the world when two ebullient young women in pink tutus bounced out at the start of the program by Julio Bocca and his Ballet Argentino on Wednesday night at City Center. True, Mr. Bocca has no more luck than the next company director finding choreography as good as the dancers, to judge from  some of the dances on the program. But the freshness and spirit of this 10-year-old company are irresistible. And with the leavening of sensuous charisma offered by Mr. Bocca, a seasoned international ballet star, the evening was a happy one.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece was Ana Maria Stekelman's ''Piazzolla Tango Vivo,'' a suite of dances performed to music by the tango master Astor Piazzolla. The score was performed live -- and with delicious clarity and passion -- by the Fundacion Astor Piazzolla Quintet, whose conductor, Fernando Suarez Paz, accompanied Piazzolla for over a decade.</p>
        <p>Hard-core tango fans might wish for the kind of tough old sinew and world-weary sexiness that made the show ''Tango Argentino'' such a hit. Ms. Stekelman occasionally alludes to traditional form with flashing, fast-working legs and sultry male duos and trios. And the craggy faces of some of Mr. Bocca's men almost come close to the tangy quality of the Broadway show.</p>
        <p>But most of the dancers look very young and classically trained. They could not dance ''Piazzolla Tango Vivo'' otherwise, for the piece sees the tango through the filters of concert dance.</p>
        <p>The staging is powerful, with wedges of women and men shifting about the stage, dislodging individuals for the solos and ensemble dances. Mr. Bocca has a killer solo in ''Invierno Porteno'' in which he stretches and curls into himself, a wooden table his partner, in a potent expression of the voluptuous despair that tango thrives on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bocca is in top form in yet another flowering of his long and stellar career. He is a joy to watch here not just because of his technical savvy but because of his clear, easy phrasing and the utter simplicity and conviction of his performing. That was the case, too, with his ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux. Danced with the piquant Luciana Paris, the piece opened the evening and included variations performed by Rosana Perez and Daria Vadimovna, who dances like an unleashed, sweet-tempered young racehorse.</p>
        <p>There is a distractingly soft edge to the classical dancing in the piece. The company looked more at home in the balance of the program. Cecilia Figaredo and Christian Alessandria moved for the most part as one body in their fluid, sensuous performance of Oscar Araiz's ''Adagietto,'' danced to Mahler.</p>
        <p>The cuteness of Alberto Mendez's ''Suite Generis,'' danced to Handel, was finally overwhelming despite engaging performances by Sergio Amarante, Benjamin Parada and the minxish Julieta Gros. And Mauro Bigonzetti's ''Sinfonia Entrelazada'' suggests that the choreographer has been studying Twyla Tharp's dances and Shakespeare's ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' too closely and getting too little from them. The piece was strongly danced by a cast led by Ms. Figaredo, Mr. Bocca, Ms. Paris and Mr. Parada.</p>
        <p>Ballet Argentino performs again at City Center tonight.</p>
