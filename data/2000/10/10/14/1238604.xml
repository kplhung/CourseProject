        <p>Gov. George W. Bush said today that he was troubled by a report that Russia was continuing to deliver conventional arms to Iran in violation of a deal signed by Vice President Al Gore in 1995.</p>
        <p>Republican members of Congress also reacted angrily to the report, published today in The New York Times. It said that Mr. Gore entered into an agreement with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister then, that in essence exempted Russia from a 1992 law requiring sanctions against nations that sell advanced weapons to countries that sponsor terrorism, including Iran.</p>
        <p>The 1992 sanctions law is commonly known as the Gore-McCain act after its principal sponsors, Mr. Gore, who was in the Senate then,  and Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, answering a reporter's question after a campaign appearance in Grand Rapids, Mich., said that Iran is a haven for terrorists and that any arms sales to Tehran undercut American policy.</p>
        <p>''It is in the strategic interests of the United States to have peace in the Middle East, and any secret agreement that would be destabilizing in the Middle East is a troubling piece of information,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>The Gore-Chernomyrdin deal, calling for an end to all Russian deliveries of arms to Iran by the end of 1999, was never fully disclosed to Congress or the public. Russia has failed to meet the deadline, over the protests of Mr. Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.</p>
        <p>James E. Kennedy, the vice president's communications director, said the outlines of the agreement were made public when it was signed and that members of Congress had been briefed on it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin mentioned it in a news conference the day the deal was signed in Moscow, without spelling out a number of key provisions. State Department officials briefed members of Congress and staff on the deal three weeks later, but only in skeletal form, according to a staff member who was present. The agreement is in a secret document that states that its terms will remain ''strictly confidential.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy said the agreement had served United States interests because Russia had signed no new arms sales contracts with Iran since 1995. ''America and its allies in the Middle East and the Gulf are safer and the balance of power in that region is more secure, thanks to this agreement,'' Mr. Kennedy said.</p>
        <p>He added that none of the weapons included in the agreement met the standard for triggering sanctions under the Gore-McCain law.</p>
        <p>But in a harshly worded statement, Senator McCain said, ''Clearly, the 1995 Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement was intended to evade sanctions imposed by legislation written in 1992 by the vice president and me.'' He said the assertion that the weapons were not covered by the law was ''provably false.''</p>
        <p>''They may not be state of the art,'' Senator McCain said, ''but they are good enough to affect the regional balance of power.''</p>
        <p>A number of other Republican members of Congress issued statements complaining about the Gore-Chernomyrdin deal. They suggested that the administration had violated sanctions laws and had failed to properly notify Congress of a significant international agreement.</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, and Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to President Clinton on the matter today. They sharply questioned Mr. Gore's promise to Mr. Chernomyrdin to avoid any penalties under American law.</p>
        <p>''Please assure us that this is not the case and that the vice president did not, in effect, sign a pledge with Viktor Chernomyrdin in 1995 that committed your administration to break U.S. law by dodging sanctions requirements,'' the senators wrote.</p>
        <p>They also said that the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement had many of the hallmarks of a treaty and thus should have been submitted to Congress for consideration.</p>
        <p>Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking committee, said the deal appeared aimed at keeping aid money flowing to Russia even as Moscow appeared to violate United States laws on arms transfers.</p>
        <p>''The secret Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement not only flouted law, but also failed,'' Mr. Leach said in a statement. ''The legitimization of Russian arms sales in defiance of law is hardly in the interest of a safer world. The naivete of this approach is matched only by the perfidiousness of its execution.''</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement appeared to be an executive understanding that did not require Congressional notification or approval. He said that members of his committee had been offered a briefing by the administration in the summer of 1995 but had declined it.</p>
        <p>And he dismissed Republican criticism as an election-season phenomenon.</p>
        <p>''It is a political response,'' he said.</p>
