        <p>Vinny Testaverde and Ray Lucas are getting ready for the Jets' game Sunday at New England, but today the rookie quarterback Chad Pennington completed a week of practice in which he took snaps with the first team for the first time.</p>
        <p>How surprising is that? Just two weeks ago Coach Al Groh, when asked about the possibility of playing the rookie, said, ''There would have to be a multicar wreck on the way to Giants Stadium.''</p>
        <p>There has been no car wreck, but there was a hit to an already damaged nerve in Testaverde's left shoulder last Sunday in a game against Pittsburgh. Although Testaverde continued to insist today that he was ready to start against the Patriots on Sunday, Groh said he was not sure and might need insurance, including Pennington, the backup's backup.</p>
        <p>''All our quarterbacks practiced, divided 60-20-20,'' Groh said. ''We have a variable we're dealing with. We're trying to deal with reality, and if Vinny were not in the game, then Ray would be in the game, and if Ray were not in the game then Chad would be in the game.''</p>
        <p>The 60 percent of the snaps belonged, of course, to Testaverde, the starter. He will wear new pads Sunday, but he admitted that he did not know how he or his equipment would react if his shoulder took a hit.</p>
        <p>''I can go for three months, three weeks, three plays,'' he said. ''There's no telling.''</p>
        <p>Thus, Pennington's sudden rise. He has not gone all the way to starter, but he is in the quarterback mix for the first time. Pennington has been activated every week but has not taken a snap in a regular-season game.</p>
        <p>If Pennington does play, Groh said, ''We'll let him play quarterback.'' In other words, the rookie will be in charge.</p>
        <p>''You can either manage the quarterback or let him play,'' the coach said. ''And in this particular case, I feel comfortable with any of the three who can play quarterback.''</p>
        <p>When last seen on the playing field, in the preseason, Pennington was quite efficient operating with the second- and third-string teams against opponents' backups: 22 completions in 36 attempts for 284 yards, with an interception. Pennington put his situation into focus today. ''I'm two hits away from playing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pennington, who played at Marshall in West Virginia, said that was the situation in which he found himself in 1995 as a freshman. ''Both quarterbacks got hurt, and in the third game I was starting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In each of the last two days, Pennington said, he took about a half-dozen snaps with the first team, ''maybe more.'' Despite the relatively paltry number, Pennington's work ethic has impressed the Jets. He knows what is going on. His knowledge has impressed Dan Henning, the offensive coordinator.</p>
        <p>''I can stay a little longer than the married guys, so I usually watch films for two and a half hours,'' Pennington said, describing his routine after practice and meetings. ''I guess I'm out of here about 7:30 at night.''</p>
        <p>Most players selected in the first round of the draft are expected to start before their first season is over. But a first-round quarterback, on a team with a player of Testaverde's caliber and Lucas's proven backup ability, has a different agenda.</p>
        <p>''I've had the luxury of time,'' Pennington said. ''I can cut down on mistakes a first-year player usually makes.''</p>
        <p>But that extra time may be running out. Now, he has to think of himself as the backup. For if Testaverde is not ready to play on Sunday, that means Groh will start Lucas. And that will leave Pennington as the Jets' new backup.</p>
        <p>''If my name's ever called, I'll have to step in,'' Pennington said. ''When a quarterback gets hurt, I've got to tighten up my shoelaces.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>In the first three games of the season, DREW BLEDSOE of the Patriots was sacked 15 times, including 6 times by the Jets in the season's second game. But in the last three games, New England's offensive line has solidified and cut the total to nine. The Patriots, who are using three new linemen, experimented with 15 combinations on the offensive line. Now the protection often includes keeping seven men back. . . . Eleven of the Jets' 22 starters are listed as either questionable or probable because of injury. The questionable players (50-50 to play) are quarterback VINNY TESTAVERDE and nose tackle JASON FERGUSON. The Patriots' nose tackle CHAD EATON was declared out Friday with a knee injury. . . . The Jets and the Dolphins remain the only teams that have not yielded more than 20 points in a game this season. . . . For the first time since 1996, a game between the Jets and the Patriots in New England is not being broadcast in prime time, and has not produced weeklong theatrics. Coincidentally or not, BILL PARCELLS is no longer coaching the Jets.</p>
