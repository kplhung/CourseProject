        <p>This is a critical moment for moderate Arab leaders to try to restore calm between Palestinians and Israelis. Since Anwar el-Sadat negotiated with Israel at Camp David 22 years ago, the evolution of peace diplomacy in the Middle East has drawn strength from moderate Arab leaders like Mr. Sadat's successor as Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of Morocco.</p>
        <p>Now the Arab world is passing through a generational transition, with new leaders in Jordan, Morocco and Syria. Arab leaders must decide whether they are prepared to act on behalf of peace. The intentions of some are unclear. President Mubarak, King Abdullah of Jordan and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia are working behind the scenes to encourage a cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians. With their encouragement, Yasir Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may meet in the days ahead, with President Clinton and Mr. Mubarak in attendance, to negotiate the terms of at least a temporary end to the violence.</p>

        <p>This is a critical moment for moderate Arab leaders to try to restore calm between Palestinians and Israelis. Since Anwar el-Sadat negotiated with Israel at Camp David 22 years ago, the evolution of peace diplomacy in the Middle East has drawn strength from moderate Arab leaders like Mr. Sadat's successor as Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and King Hussein of Jordan and King Hassan of Morocco.</p>
        <p>Now the Arab world is passing through a generational transition, with new leaders in Jordan, Morocco and Syria. Arab leaders must decide whether they are prepared to act on behalf of peace. The intentions of some are unclear. President Mubarak, King Abdullah of Jordan and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia are working behind the scenes to encourage a cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians. With their encouragement, Yasir Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may meet in the days ahead, with President Clinton and Mr. Mubarak in attendance, to negotiate the terms of at least a temporary end to the violence.</p>
        <p>But these and other leaders will be attending an Arab League summit meeting in Cairo next weekend that promises to be a forum for anti-Israeli rhetoric. Iraq and Syria will try to push their fellow Arabs back toward long-abandoned policies of ostracizing Israel, diplomatically and economically. But they will be in the minority, and it will be up to more forward-looking leaders to resist their pressures and revive the quest for regional peace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak and Crown Prince Abdullah understand that the past two weeks of clashes and killings have stirred raw emotions in their own societies that are now being exploited by radical Islamic groups. Both are pragmatic and experienced and do not want to see their own rule threatened.</p>
        <p>Younger leaders like King Abdullah of Jordan and King Mohammed of Morocco are even more inclined toward peacemaking. Carrying the farsighted diplomatic outlook of their fathers one step further, they understand that their own bold plans for modernizing their countries require regional peace and mutually beneficial trade between Arabs and Israelis.</p>
        <p>Syria's young new leader, Bashar al-Assad, has shown disappointingly little interest in domestic reforms or diplomatic flexibility. But his hawkishness is tempered by the knowledge that Syria cannot fight Israel on its own and that his own grip on power could be threatened by an unsuccessful military confrontation. Saddam Hussein of Iraq is perhaps the only Arab leader who would benefit from a reversal of the past decade's progress. If other Arab leaders do not want the future of their region to be determined by men like Mr. Hussein, they should serve as peacemakers today.</p>
