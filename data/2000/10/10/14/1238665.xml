        <p>The explosion that rocked Britain's Embassy in Yemen today jarred memories of Britain's uncomfortable relationship with its former colony, and of the  terrorist underworld that seems to be at work there, British experts said.</p>
        <p>Britain's ties with Yemen date to its occupation of Aden in 1839 as the British vied with the Ottoman Empire for a corner of the Arabian peninsula. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the port became a vital link in the sea routes between Victorian Britain and its imperial outpost in India. British rule came to an end only in 1967, after a deadly wave of fighting.</p>
        <p>But in recent times, the experts said, it is Britain's role as an ally of the United States and as a symbol of Western maneuvering in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East that has made it a target in the region.</p>
        <p>''If the British are coming under fire, it is nothing to do with the past,'' said Gerd Nonneman, the director of the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies, who specializes in Yemen. ''It's everything to do with the policy in Iraq and support for the United States.''</p>
        <p>''Yemeni terrorism has been vastly exaggerated,'' Dr. Nonneman said in a telephone interview from Lancaster University, where he teaches.  ''There are various groups inside the country, as in lots of countries, maybe with only two or three people, who might call themselves anything from Jihad to Hezbollah,'' he said, referring to the Arabic words for holy war and party of god. Still, he said, ''the government doesn't control all the territory and therefore does not get access to where these groups might be hiding out.''</p>
        <p>He drew a distinction between today's embassy bombing and the attack on Thursday on the American naval vessel Cole that killed 17 sailors. While the embassy bomb could well have been Yemeni-inspired, the attack on the Cole required a level of intelligence-gathering and technical skill ''that indicated that it was not completely home-grown,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With passions heightened throughout the Arab world by the Palestinian-Israeli clashes, he said, ''the Americans are seen as the supporters of Israel, and these extremist groups find their room for maneuver is increasing.''</p>
        <p>Britain's most recent previous brush with Yemeni terrorism has been a bizarre saga that began in December 1998, when a rental car with three passengers crashed after speeding away from a police road check. The Yemeni police said they had found weapons and explosives in it. Immediately, five British Muslims and a man with a French passport were arrested.</p>
        <p>By coincidence, another group of Britons, 16 tourists, were traveling in the Abyan region of Yemen with a tour company. Just days after the British Muslims were arrested, the tourists were kidnapped in what the Yemeni authorities called an attempt to force the release of the arrested Muslims.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 29, 1998, one day after the kidnapping, Yemeni forces tried to free the British hostages by force, and four of the tourists died in a gun battle. Two of the kidnappers were killed, and three were arrested.</p>
        <p>Then, in January, Yemeni forces besieged a mountain hide-out and arrested six more suspects in the kidnapping, including three Britons with reported ties to Abu Hamza al-Masri, the imam of a London mosque  who has claimed to have fought with the mujahedeen in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing trials last year, prosecutors sought to link the British Muslims and Mr. Abu Hamza with the Yemeni extremists who kidnapped the tourists. But the hearings remained murky because of reporting restrictions and frequent claims by defendants that ''confessions'' had been extracted under torture. Newspaper reports quoted Mr. Abu Hamza in London as threatening reprisals against British and American interests in Yemen.</p>
        <p>According to the British Foreign Office, five of the arrested Muslims are still serving three to seven years in prison in Yemen. Two were freed after the 1999 trials, and one was released during the trials.</p>
        <p>Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that after the trial, there was a threat to bomb a British consulate in Yemen, and they speculated that elements of the Islamic Army of Aden-Abyan -- whose leader, Abu al-Hassan al-Mihdar, was executed after a separate trial last year -- had survived to carry out today's attack on the British Embassy in Sana, the Yemeni capital.</p>
        <p>But a Foreign Office spokeswoman said only that a bomb had been thrown over the embassy wall and that a judgment on whether this was a terrorist attack would depend on an investigation by the British police.</p>
