        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH</p>
        <p>Remarks yesterday to auto workers in Pontiac, Mich.:</p>
        <p>''Oil consumption is increasing; production is dropping; imports of foreign oil are rising. Yet Vice President Gore's administration has failed to act. As a result, America, more than ever, is at the mercy of foreign governments and cartels.</p>
        <p>On the Clinton-Gore watch, the American government has lost credibility with OPEC nations, including our gulf war allies. We fought a war in defense of some of these countries; yet we are unable to convince them to maintain an adequate and stable supply of oil.</p>
        <p>On the Clinton-Gore watch, Saddam Hussein's Iraq has become a major supplier of oil to America. This means that one of our worst enemies is gaining more and more control over our country's economic future. The current crisis in the Middle East underscores the danger of American reliance on Saddam  Hussein's oil.</p>
        <p>Several weeks ago, just weeks before the election, Vice President Gore called for releasing oil from America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I  strongly disagreed, because the strategic reserve is meant for times of war or a major disruption in oil supplies. It is a petroleum reserve, not a political reserve.</p>
        <p>Every barrel released today is one less barrel available to protect us against threats to our security, threats that are becoming more vivid with this week's turmoil and violence in the Middle East. Vice President Gore called for this release and he should take responsibility for what has occurred.''</p>
