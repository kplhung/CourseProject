        <p>A passive, relaxed observer of baseball, Tom Pettitte is not. He studies games like an extra coach. He wants to know if his son, Andy, has his fingers with or against the seams of the baseball. He wants to know what Don Zimmer just whispered to Joe Torre in the dugout.</p>
        <p>That is why Pettitte planned to plant himself in his living room in Deer Park, Tex., last night, turn on his 46-inch television and watch Andy pitch Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Mariners. Tom shouts, he critiques and he acts as if his favorite chair were transported to Section 39 in the right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium.</p>

        <p>A passive, relaxed observer of baseball, Tom Pettitte is not. He studies games like an extra coach. He wants to know if his son, Andy, has his fingers with or against the seams of the baseball. He wants to know what Don Zimmer just whispered to Joe Torre in the dugout.</p>
        <p>That is why Pettitte planned to plant himself in his living room in Deer Park, Tex., last night, turn on his 46-inch television and watch Andy pitch Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Mariners. Tom shouts, he critiques and he acts as if his favorite chair were transported to Section 39 in the right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''If he's not pitching well, I'm yelling for Torre to get him out of the game,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''There's no excuse for it. I'm just like any other New York fan that way.''</p>
        <p>There was probably some yelling in the living room last night because Pettitte permitted hits to five of the first eight batters he faced and noticed that the Mariners were sitting on his inside pitches. Pettitte then shifted to tossing changeups, working both corners and showing the tenacity that always reassures his father and others in helping the Yankees defeat the Mariners, 8-2.</p>
        <p>Pettitte retired Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez with the potential tying run on in the fifth and limited two of the most dangerous hitters in the major leagues to one run batted in. Pettitte tip-toed, he danced, he survived and the Yankees now lead the series two games to one.</p>
        <p>''We're doing it,'' Luis Sojo said. ''This is Yankee baseball.''</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams called Pettitte ''just great'' and focused on how he stopped Martinez and Rodriguez. An appreciative Torre was not surprised by Pettitte's performance, saying simply, ''I trust him very much.''</p>
        <p>He should. Pettitte had been bruised for 14 earned runs in 19 1/3 innings against the Mariners this season, but it is rare for Pettitte to have two listless starts in a row. Even on a night when Pettitte searched for rhythm because the Mariners zeroed in on his cut fastball and four-seam fastball, he followed up his debacle against Oakland by allowing two earned runs over six and two-thirds innings.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there was one inning where they didn't have a guy on base,'' Jeff Nelson said. ''Once they got there, he made the pitches to get out of it.''</p>
        <p>Back in Deer Park, it does not take long for Tom's wife, Joann, to leave him alone in the living room. She prefers to pace in the bedroom where there is a 19-inch set and no commentary from the unpaid announcer.</p>
        <p>''I'm a Momma,'' Joann explained. ''He's a coach.''</p>
        <p>At least Tom Pettitte is watching the games now. Not long ago, Tom refused to even watch his son pitch on TV because he would inevitably become stressed by criticism of his son.</p>
        <p>When you have undergone double bypass heart surgery as Tom Pettitte did two years ago, it is sensible to reduce the stress in your life. Pettitte realizes that. But his doctor allowed him to watch Andy clinch Game 4 of the 1998 World Series less than a week after surgery.</p>
        <p>Octobers have been exhilarating and exasperating for the Pettitte family. There have been sweet triumphs for Andy while the Yankees have won three of the last four World Series, but there have also been major medical problems for Tom. Tom detailed the problems as if he were reading a grocery list of milk and eggs.</p>
        <p>Twenty-four inches of his colon removed in October 1997. Bypass surgery to repair a 90 percent blockage in October 1998. An enlarged prostate and a heart catheterization last October. The 51-year-old Tom was fending off a slight cold today. A few sneezes? That was a relief.</p>
        <p>''So far,'' Tom said, ''this October has been good.''</p>
        <p>Andy has reminded his father that baseball ''ain't that important'' when compared to good health. Try to relax and enjoy the games, Andy has told him. Tom nods. If only it were that easy.</p>
        <p>Have you ever thrown a baseball with your son from the time he was 2? Ever seen him weep as a 5-year-old after he lost a football game because he felt the other kids did not try hard enough? Ever taught him the superb pickoff move that he used to nab Martinez last night? Until you have done those things, he said, you cannot grasp why a father behaves the way he does.</p>
        <p>A few days ago, the 28-year-old Andy called his father and sounded like an innocent 13-year-old when he said, ''You're coming back to New York if we make it to the World Series, aren't you?''</p>
        <p>Tom Pettitte, a patient for so many Octobers and a coach and a parent for so many years, had not thought that far ahead. But he quickly provided the answer a child wants to hear: ''If we make it to the World Series, we're coming back.'' Because of what Andy helped accomplish last night, the Yankees need two more victories to make the trip to New York a reality.</p>
