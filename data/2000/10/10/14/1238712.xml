        <p>Lindsay Davenport and Jennifer Capriati had unsteady matches yesterday but managed to advance to the semifinals of the $1.08 million Swisscom Challenge in Zurich.</p>
        <p>Davenport, seeded second, was down by 2-0 in the first set and by 3-0 in the second before rallying to defeat seventh-seeded Chanda Rubin, 6-2, 6-4.</p>
        <p>Capriati, seeded sixth, was shaky but defeated an even shakier Anna Kournikova, seeded fourth, 7-6 (4), 6-4, in a match marked by repeated unforced errors.</p>
        <p>In today's semifinals, Davenport will play Barbara Schett of Austria and Capriati will face Martina Hingis. Schett upset third-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>KUERTEN WITHDRAWS: Top-seeded Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, dizzy and drained from a bad cold, retired during the third set yesterday of his quarterfinal with Dominik Hrbaty at the Japan Open in Tokyo. I didn't have enough power to keep competing, Kuerten said.</p>
        <p>Kuerten, winner of this year's French Open, was trailing Hrbaty, of Slovakia, 7-6 (6), 2-6, 0-3. Hrbaty will face fourth-seeded Nicholas Lapentti of Ecuador in the semifinals. Lapentti beat sixth-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe, 6-2, 6-2.</p>
        <p>The women's defending champion, Amy Frazier, reached the final, downing Joannette Kruger of South Africa, 7-5, 6-2. She will play top-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis of France or fifth-seeded Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand.</p>
        <p>Pioline OUSTS Hometown Favorite: Austrian Sefan Koubek was ousted in straight sets by Frenchman Cedric Pioline in the quarterfinals at the CA Trophy tournament.</p>
        <p>It took the eighth-seeded Pioline slightly more than one hour to win 6-3, 6-3. Pioline will play Tommy Haas, the Olympic silver medalist in Sydney who beat Frenchman Jerome Golmard, 2-6, 6-3, 6-1.</p>
        <p>Roger Federer also qualified for semifinal play. The 19-year-old Swiss, fourth in the Sydney Olympics, defeated former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, 6-4, 6-3.</p>
