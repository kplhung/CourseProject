        <p>Facing a state-imposed deadline to get thousands of uncertified teachers out of New York City classrooms, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy will expand, almost tenfold, a fledgling program that offers novices a crash course in teaching and grants them an alternative form of certification.</p>
        <p>The expansion would mark a profound change in the way teachers are hired and trained in New York City, potentially affecting one of every four recruits. Mr. Levy's aides said the expansion would make the city's alternative certification program the largest in the nation.</p>
        <p>In an interview Thursday, Mr. Levy said that he planned to hire as many as 3,000 aspiring or unlicensed teachers into the program, called New York City Teaching Fellows, for the 2001-02 school year. About 350 teaching fellows were hired this year.</p>
        <p>State education officials sued Mr. Levy last summer to ensure that he hired only certified teachers to fill vacancies in the city's lowest-performing schools this fall. A resulting court order forced him to place all newly certified teachers in the lowest-performing elementary schools. By next September, the city will be able to hire only certified teachers for low-performing middle and high schools, and by 2003, the requirement will be applied to all of the city's 1,100 schools.</p>
        <p>All of the current teaching fellows, who have a temporary form of certification, are working in the 94 lowest-performing  schools, and Mr. Levy plans to assign many of next year's fellows there, too. But he is sharply expanding the teaching fellows program to meet the 2003 deadline.</p>
        <p>As part of the program, the Board of Education provides mentors for the teaching fellows and pays for them to get master's degrees in education from the City University of New York. This year's fellows, who also participated in a training program in August, are taking night courses and are on track to  get master's degrees over two years.</p>
        <p>Roughly 12,000 of the city's 78,000 teachers, or 14 percent, are uncertified. Vicki Bernstein, a special assistant to Mr. Levy, said that the Board of Education would admit up to 1,000 of the system's uncertified teachers into the Teaching Fellows program next year to speed up their certification.</p>
        <p>Nearly every state has established some alternative route to teacher certification, allowing those who do not have an undergraduate degree in education to enter the profession. The programs have run into criticism from educators who say they do not adequately prepare candidates for the rigors of teaching. Critics also point out that the programs typically assign participants to struggling schools with large numbers of poor and minority children, who, they say, desperately need more experienced teachers.</p>
        <p>''It's a risk,'' Mr. Levy said of his plans to expand the alternative certification program, acknowledging that it is too soon to assess how well the first round of teaching fellows are doing. ''But it would be a bigger risk to not do this. These are smart people, and my bet is that given enough time, they will produce smart results.''</p>
        <p>It costs about $20,000 to put each teaching fellow through the program, Ms. Bernstein said. That means the board would be spending more than $600 million on the 3,000 fellows it plans to hire next year.</p>
        <p>The State Board of Regents paved the way for New York City's experimental program when it voted in July to allow an alternative certification route for teachers. All college graduates with at least a 3.0 grade point average can apply, no matter how sparse their teaching experience. The Board of Education received 2,300 applications from around the country last summer, after only a few weeks of publicizing the program.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Levy's program is similar to Teach for America, the national organization that places recent college graduates in urban schools, it is directed at slightly older people who have been working for at least several years. Most of this year's applicants -- who included lawyers, social workers and bankers, to name a few -- had already tried at least one career.</p>
        <p>The traditional way to become a certified teacher in New York State has been to get a bachelor's degree, typically in education, then to pass two state certification exams. Once they are on the job, teachers have to get master's degrees and pass an exam in their subject area within five years. Many other teachers, however, are hired and placed in classrooms with just a college education and then struggle for years to pass their certification exams and take the necessary courses toward a master's degree.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he already considered the teaching fellows program a success because the vast majority of this year's fellows passed two of the state's certification exams on their first try. They took the exams in August, with hardly any preparation. In comparison, 60 percent of the 4,300 people who took the main certification exam in the city in July failed, according to the state. Many of those people were uncertified teachers who have repeatedly failed the test.</p>
        <p>The trial-by-fire approach is clearly stressful: of the 350 teaching fellows hired by the board last summer, about 25 dropped out in August and 20 more have left since the school year began on Sept. 7. Ms. Bernstein said most of the people who left after school started did so because they were overwhelmed by discipline problems or thought they did not have enough support from administrators. Some principals have also complained that the teaching fellows assigned to their schools did not have nearly enough preparation.</p>
        <p>The fellows were not selected until late July, so they had only a month of intensive training before school opened. But because Mr. Levy hopes to hire the next round by April, they will have all summer to prepare for their new jobs, Ms. Bernstein said.  Ms. Bernstein said the board would advertise the teaching fellows program in newspapers and on the Internet starting next month. The board will continue working with the New Teacher Project, a consulting group affiliated with Teach for America, which is helping to advertise the program, select the fellows and give them adequate support during the school year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy also wants to involve district superintendents and school principals in the selection process this year, Ms. Bernstein said. The chancellor has appointed an advisory board of superintendents, teacher union officials and others with whom he will meet weekly to discuss plans for expanding the alternative certification program.</p>
