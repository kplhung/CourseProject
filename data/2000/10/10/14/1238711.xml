        <p>The Rangers insist that Dale Purinton is part of their future. However, Purinton, a 24-year-old defenseman, is obviously not in the team's current plans.</p>
        <p>The Rangers recalled defenseman David Wilkie from the Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League yesterday and returned Purinton to Hartford of the American Hockey League.</p>
        <p>Purinton had been recalled from a two-week conditioning program at Hartford before the Rangers' home opener Wednesday night because Vladimir Malakhov injured his left knee. When it was determined that Malakhov would miss four weeks with a sprained anterior cruciate ligament, the Rangers decided to recall the 26-year-old Wilkie. Purinton was the odd man out.</p>
