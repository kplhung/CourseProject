        <p>Editorial criticizes Federation for American Immigration Reform for seeming to blame immigrants for suburban sprawl and congestion</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Next time you are stuck in traffic, blame an immigrant. That seems to be the message of a deplorable advertising campaign by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an advocacy group that seeks to restrict immigration. FAIR's broadcast and print ads highlight the ills associated with suburban sprawl, then point to immigration as the underlying culprit. FAIR ran anti-sprawl commercials earlier this year in Iowa and South Carolina during the primary season, and is now concentrating on the Washington D.C. area.</p>
        <p>The notion that foreign immigrants are primarily responsible for out-of-control sprawl in American cities is absurd. Cities experiencing no population growth also grapple with excessive sprawl, which suggests that faulty urban planning, demand for new housing and tax and transportation policies are the real culprits. Immigrants, in any case, congregate in city centers and older suburbs.</p>

        <p>Next time you are stuck in traffic, blame an immigrant. That seems to be the message of a deplorable advertising campaign by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an advocacy group that seeks to restrict immigration. FAIR's broadcast and print ads highlight the ills associated with suburban sprawl, then point to immigration as the underlying culprit. FAIR ran anti-sprawl commercials earlier this year in Iowa and South Carolina during the primary season, and is now concentrating on the Washington D.C. area.</p>
        <p>The notion that foreign immigrants are primarily responsible for out-of-control sprawl in American cities is absurd. Cities experiencing no population growth also grapple with excessive sprawl, which suggests that faulty urban planning, demand for new housing and tax and transportation policies are the real culprits. Immigrants, in any case, congregate in city centers and older suburbs.</p>
        <p>In May The Times reported that FAIR had run ads in Michigan suggesting that Senator Spencer Abraham's pro-immigration stance would make it easier for terrorists like Osama bin Laden to attack America. Such preposterous ads clearly spring from a sense of desperation among anti-immigration groups. Stoking anti-immigration rage is not an easy task when the nation's unemployment rate has dipped below 4 percent, and when the job market is eagerly seeking not only cheap labor for menial tasks but also skilled foreigners to keep the high-tech revolution in gear. Indeed, last week Congress voted to nearly double the number of visas for foreign workers with high-tech skills.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, groups like FAIR and politicians like Patrick Buchanan and Pete Wilson attacked immigration as a threat to the economic security of millions of Americans. Today such claims ring hollow, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas deserves credit for altering the tenor of his party's rhetoric on immigration.</p>
        <p>Rather than await the next economic downturn to vilify immigration once again, FAIR is trying to piggyback onto a legitimate concern to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment. Do not be surprised if it next blames immigrants for air traffic congestion and high fuel prices.</p>
