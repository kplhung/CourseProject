        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has raised $125 million in six months for the Republican National Committee, more than twice the $60 million that Vice President Al Gore has raised for the Democratic National Committee, according to officials from both parties.</p>
        <p>Both parties have shattered quarterly fund-raising levels for this stage in a presidential campaign. Officials said that over the last three months, the Republicans had raised $101 million and had $45 million left in cash on hand as of the end of September. The Democrats raised $55 million in that period and had $26 million in cash.</p>
        <p>The two parties today released their quarterly fund-raising reports to the Federal Election Commission.</p>
        <p>At this point in 1996, the Republicans had $25 million in the bank and the Democrats had $13 million. In the third quarter of 1996, the Republicans had raised $64 million and the Democrats had raised $43 million.</p>
        <p>The Republican committee has raised $188 million since the beginning of this year. Mr. Bush, who turned his fund-raising attentions to the party in April after he had sewn up the nomination, is responsible for $125 million of that, or 66 percent, party officials said. He raised the money through coast-to-coast personal appearances and direct-mail letters to specific voters.</p>
        <p>The Democratic committee has raised $119 million, with the amount raised by Mr. Gore representing  about 50 percent of the total.</p>
        <p>But the cash that each party has on hand is not a true reflection of how much each has to spend in the final days before the Nov. 7 election.</p>
        <p>For one thing, both candidates are continuing to raise money. And both sides have already paid for television time for commercials this month.</p>
        <p>More important, advocacy groups for each candidate are beginning to spend money on advertising and get-out-the-vote drives. Getting out the vote is considered crucial if voter turnout is as low as analysts expect.</p>
        <p>On the Democratic side, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is expected to spend $9 million to increase voter turnout. Groups that favor abortion rights are already advertising on television and are expected to spend a few million on Mr. Gore's behalf. The Democratic National Committee may spend as much as $25 million for voter turnout, officials said.</p>
        <p>Labor is also expected to spend millions for Mr. Gore. As in 1998, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is spending less on television commercials and more on outreach programs in which union members call other union workers and urge them to vote Democratic. Incalculable in terms of money -- and value -- to Mr. Gore are factors like the United Auto Workers' having won in their contract the right to take off Election Day as a paid holiday, thus allowing them to devote the day to taking people to the polls to vote for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>On the Republican side, the committee is expected to spend about $50 million on get-out-the-vote efforts. Groups like the National Rifle Association and the Christian Coalition will also spend millions in urging their members to get to the polls.</p>
        <p>But officials in both camps said that the violence in the Middle East had momentarily frozen the political dynamic, partly because news of the Middle East has temporarily eclipsed campaign coverage and neither side wants to be perceived as overly political during an international crisis. This gives both campaigns a chance to reassess where to spend their money and how to divide it between the air war, on television, and the ground war, which is run less visibly on radio and direct mail and is aimed at getting out the vote.</p>
        <p>But they cannot lie low for long, since some states, like Oregon, begin voting by mail next week.</p>
        <p>The increases in spending in certain states and the decreases in spending in other states in the last two weeks before the election will reveal the campaigns' true strategies and where they think their money can be spent most effectively.</p>
        <p>The money that both campaigns reported today is separate from the $67 million that each received in taxpayer money for the fall campaign. In exchange for that money, the candidates cannot raise more for themselves, but they can continue to raise money for their parties.</p>
