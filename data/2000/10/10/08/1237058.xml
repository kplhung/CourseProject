        <p>Talk about fast out of the gate. The newly hatched Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty fund took second place in the performance rankings for the third quarter, with a return of 22.8 percent. So it is not surprising that Focus Twenty has already gathered $1.7 billion in assets.</p>
        <p>The fund, started on March 3, holds 20 stocks, 17 of them in technology. ''Technology is driving the economy, so that's where most of the growth ideas are now,'' said Jim McCall, the manager, who is 47. He also runs the $256 million Merrill Lynch Premier Growth fund and the Merrill Lynch Mid-Cap Growth fund, introduced on Sept. 26.</p>

        <p>Talk about fast out of the gate. The newly hatched Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty fund took second place in the performance rankings for the third quarter, with a return of 22.8 percent. So it is not surprising that Focus Twenty has already gathered $1.7 billion in assets.</p>
        <p>The fund, started on March 3, holds 20 stocks, 17 of them in technology. ''Technology is driving the economy, so that's where most of the growth ideas are now,'' said Jim McCall, the manager, who is 47. He also runs the $256 million Merrill Lynch Premier Growth fund and the Merrill Lynch Mid-Cap Growth fund, introduced on Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall aims for a balanced portfolio; when a single stock accounts for more than 10 percent of it, he starts trimming it back. His winning stock for the quarter, Extreme Networks, up 117 percent, is not quite there yet, at 8 percent of the portfolio. But, judging from his expectations for the stock, it may require trimming soon.</p>
        <p>Extreme Networks, in Santa Clara, Calif., manufactures high-end, commercial switches for local area networks, or LAN's, which can link personal computers around an office or around the world.</p>
        <p>Why the triple-digit growth for the stock? ''It's a next-generation technology that's starting to displace less-efficient technology,'' Mr. McCall said. ''There's intelligence built into the semiconductor chips used in the switches that lets them identify packets of data quicker and move them along more quickly to where they have to go.''</p>
        <p>Revenue more than doubled compared with the third quarter a year ago, he said, while earnings growth lagged slightly, at 80 percent, because of a recent acquisition.</p>
        <p>Will the company be able to sustain such astounding growth? ''As best as we can tell, yes,'' Mr. McCall said.</p>
