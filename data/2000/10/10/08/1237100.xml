        <p>Two storeowners in Astoria have little to say to each other. Instead, they let their signs do the talking.</p>
        <p>''Clean Juice Bar of Clean Place and Clean People'' reads a bright yellow sign printed with orange and green letters posted on the window of Lots-O-Bagels on Broadway between 30th and 31st Streets.</p>
        <p>Broadway Natural Groceries is just three doors down. In its window it has a handwritten sign on hot pink paper that reads: ''Get your healthy juice at the health food store. Please don't be fooled by imitations.''</p>
        <p>James Lee, who owns the bagel shop, and Jitendra Patel, the store owner, say they do not know each other's names. But they keep close tabs on each other's juice bars. Their battle for Astoria's juice drinkers is being fought with signs as ammunition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patel opened his health food store and its juice bar two years ago. But his juice business did not really take off until this summer, when he started selling specially mixed drinks intended to cure upset stomachs and other ailments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee's store has been open for four years. He said he has had a juice bar since then, but began advertising only in July, when he put up several signs, including the one calling the bar ''clean.'' He said they  were aimed at customers and not at the health food store.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patel disagrees.</p>
        <p>The grocery storeowner said his competitor put up the first sign in response to his increased business. And so he retaliated with several signs of his own.</p>
        <p>''When I see that somebody is playing dirty, I will stand up also,'' Mr. Patel said. ''I will defend myself.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Patel's signs said his juices were made from organically grown fruits and vegetables and were pesticide free. Mr. Lee admitted that he did not sell organic juice at first. But three weeks ago, he began offering it, and a sign announced its arrival.</p>
        <p>''I have to put up a sign to advertise to customers,'' Mr. Lee said.</p>
        <p>Customers said they were not influenced by the signs. David Leventhal, a dancer who was in Mr. Patel's store, said he was puzzled by Mr. Lee's sign because it implied that the health food store ''was a dirty place, which it's obviously not.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I'm loyal to this place.''</p>
        <p>The conflict between the two stores is far from over. Mr. Patel's newest sign says he will sell organic bagels at the end of the month.</p>
        <p>''This winter I'm going to promote my coffee and my bagels, and he's going to cry for business,'' Mr. Patel said.</p>
