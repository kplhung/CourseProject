        <p>Roughly 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle, hard by the icy Beaufort Sea, this tiny Eskimo village is unlikely to be a stop on the presidential campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Getting here entails a bumpy flight across the Brooks Range, and arrival is marked by a cheerful greeting from Kaktovik's mayor, Lon Sonsalla, who gestures across the gravel airstrip to the magnificent but fearsome animals lumbering nearby on the tundra: ''Watch out for the polar bears.''</p>
        <p>Yet as the candidates spar over what to do about rising fuel prices, the people who live here in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge find the future of their homeland to be a major campaign issue, one that popped up in the first presidential debate. For while they are living in one of the great untouched wilderness areas of the world, they are also atop what may be the largest untapped oil reserve in the United States.</p>
        <p>The dispute over this refuge could not be more clear. Drill it, says Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Leave it alone, says Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>The same line divides the oil industry and environmental advocates. And it divides two native groups who have lived here for centuries, generating perhaps the most bitter tensions of all, since the stakes involve their very way of life.</p>
        <p>The Inupiat Eskimos of Kaktovik  generally favor plans to drill along the 1.5 million acres of coastal plain  for oil, which they think will bring them enormous economic benefits, including improvements in schools and health care. So they endorse the arguments of drilling proponents, including Alaska's top politicians, who say it is lunacy not to explore the tundra for the billions of barrels of oil that may lie beneath.</p>
        <p>''Moola,'' Fenton Rexford, president of the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, the business arm of the Eskimos, said with a hearty smile.</p>
        <p>But the Gwich'in Indians, citing fears that rigs, roads and pipes will mar the land and devastate the caribou herd on which they rely for food, are viscerally opposed. They are allied with environmental groups, who say drilling is a short-term energy fix that will permanently scar this austere but beautiful landscape. It lies frozen for much of the year but  bursts to life in the Arctic spring with such a display of birds and wild animals, including tens of thousands of migrating caribou, that some call it an American Serengeti.</p>
        <p>''There's no technology in the world that will make it safe for mothers and their calves,'' said Sarah James, an elder in Arctic Village, a Gwich'in community of about 120 people.</p>
        <p>The two groups live on opposite sides of the 9,000-foot-high Brooks Range and have become so alienated on the issue that they barely speak to each other.</p>
        <p>And members of both groups say they have been paying much more attention than they otherwise might to this presidential campaign. They have satellite dishes and a string of cable television lines set up in Kaktovik, a complex of small wooden and corrugated-steel homes and other buildings that hugs the shore of an ice floe-laden sea.</p>
        <p>''Oh, boy, another month of this,'' said 78-year-old Isaac Akootchook, a whaling captain and village elder, rolling his eyes when yet another news clip showing Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush popped up on the screen. Yet they are keenly aware of what the candidates are saying, at least about the Arctic refuge.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush, echoing a plan that his father, then President George Bush, unsuccessfully sought in Congress, strongly favors opening the refuge to exploration and drilling.</p>
        <p>While no one knows for sure how much oil is below the permafrost, Mr. Bush, citing oil experts, says that the fields could produce a million barrels a day -- roughly the same amount, as he put it in the debate, as the country imports daily from Saddam Hussein, with whom his father went to war over protecting Middle East oil supplies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was speaking in rough terms, since the average this year for oil imported from Iraq is 585,000 barrels a day, says the Energy Department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is just as staunchly opposed to opening what he calls ''this environmental treasure'' to drilling, arguing the country needs to focus on conservation and other ways of decreasing demand.</p>
        <p>''It would only give us a few months worth of oil, and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future,'' he said in the debate. ''That's the wrong choice. I know the oil companies have been itching to do that. But it is not the right thing for the future.''</p>
        <p>The government's geological estimate of likely reserves ranges from about 3 billion to 16 billion barrels, and each side dramatizes what the figures mean in very different ways.</p>
        <p>Opponents like Mr. Gore, using the lower figure, often say it contains ''only 6 months'' of the nation's demand for oil; supporters, citing the higher figure, say it could be enough to represent 30 years' worth of what the country imports from Middle Eastern countries like Iraq.</p>
        <p>Here in Alaska, the issue is huge, for obvious reasons: oil, mostly from the Prudhoe Bay fields 100 miles or so to the west, is Alaska's economic engine. It not only pays for roughly three-quarters of the state budget and keeps residents here from paying state income taxes, it is also responsible for the annual ''dividend'' that every man, woman and child in the state receives simply for living here.</p>
        <p>The money -- $1,963.86, in checks that are being mailed this month -- comes from the state's so-called Permanent Fund. But despite that optimistic name, oil is coursing down the Trans-Alaska Pipeline at half the peak rate in the late 1980's of two million barrels a day, says the State Division of Oil and Gas. For many Alaskans, extending drilling to the Arctic refuge may be a way to extend their oil-fueled financial bonanza another decade or two.</p>
        <p>There is general support in the state for opening the refuge -- the Legislature once voted 59 to 1 in favor of a resolution urging that course.</p>
        <p>For the Inupiat Eskimos who live in Kaktovik, population 260, and who own more of the land where the drilling would take place, the benefits are clear.</p>
        <p>''Energy, warmer houses, better transportation, better schools, more opportunities for the young people,'' said Mr. Rexford of the Inupiat business group. Many Eskimos say the Gwich'in are jealous, because they would get less in the way of oil revenues. And they resent outsiders debating what to do with their land.</p>
        <p>''Who is Al Gore to say what to do here?'' said Carla Sims Kayotuk, an Eskimo who runs the local store here. ''He wants to keep this a rich man's playground.''</p>
        <p>But the Gwich'in, members of an Athabascan tribe who are the northernmost Indians in the United States, say money is not an issue. They want to preserve a sacred place, and the 129,000-strong Porcupine caribou herd.</p>
        <p>And Gwich'in say the Eskimos, who depend on whaling for much of their protein, are inconsistent because they remain deeply opposed to proposals for offshore drilling for oil. Inupiat whaling crews here recently took three 30-ton bowhead whales from the Arctic Ocean, providing enough meat for everyone in the village for the coming year.</p>
        <p>Drilling proponents pointed out that despite dire predictions, a smaller caribou herd nearer the Prudhoe Bay complex has actually grown since oil production started there.</p>
        <p>''You fly into Deadhorse, and there are caribou all over the place,'' said Ken Boyd, director of the State Division of Oil and Gas, speaking of the oil town at Prudhoe Bay. ''They're on the runway. These animals can adapt. This idea that they'll drop dead because they see oil production going on, it's just nuts.''</p>
        <p>And Roger Herrera, a geologist and consultant to Arctic Power, a lobbying group that favored opening the refuge, said the oil industry had ''bent over backwards'' to prevent harm to the caribou at Prudhoe Bay, and would do so here.</p>
        <p>David R. Klein, professor emeritus at the University of Alaska's Institute of Arctic Biology, who has been studying Alaskan caribou for nearly 40 years, said any comparisons between what happened at Prudhoe Bay and what might happen here are treacherous, as this herd is larger and may share a smaller calving and foraging space with oil facilities.</p>
        <p>''There will be impacts, that's obvious,'' he said. ''The magnitudes of that impact are simply very difficult to project.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sonsalla said he thought drilling would happen eventually.</p>
        <p>''Change is inevitable,'' he said. ''Hopefully we can control our own destiny.''</p>
