        <p>He was the last man standing, as he always is, although it was hard to see Benny Agbayani in the euphoric throng of Mets at home plate. The left fielder was swallowed up in a tidal wave of teammates, who are becoming famous for games like this.</p>
        <p>With the Mets, October is always thrilling. And with Agbayani -- somehow, some way -- there is almost always a happy ending.</p>
        <p>In the 322nd minute of the Mets' latest playoff opus, Agbayani launched an Aaron Fultz fastball into the left-field bleachers, giving the Mets a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants and a two-games-to-one lead in this three-of-five-game division series. One more victory and they will face the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>Agbayani was not supposed to make the Mets' roster out of spring training. He could have been sent to the minors without complications, and because of a crunch on roster spaces, Agbayani seemed certain to be left out.</p>
        <p>He requested a trade, but survived -- and thrived. He bashed a grand slam in Tokyo in March for the Mets' first victory of the season, and soon he was a regular player. Agbayani has an unlikely background (he is from Hawaii) and shape (225 pounds, 5 feet 10 inches) for a pro baseball player, but he has made it.</p>
        <p>He will be canonized now, the hero of one of the greatest postseason games in recent years.</p>
        <p>''Bobby Valentine told me things have a way of working out,'' Agbayani said. ''I didn't understand that. Now I do.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' bullpen gave Agbayani the chance to triumph, as five relievers combined for seven shutout innings. Rick White, who worked out of jams in the 12th and 13th innings, was the winner, following Dennis Cook, Turk Wendell, John Franco and Armando Benitez.</p>
        <p>The Mets waited until the sixth inning to get their first hit, as right-hander Russ Ortiz mastered them again. But Ortiz faltered in the sixth, when the rookie Timo Perez knocked in the Mets' first run and cut the Giants' lead to 2-1.</p>
        <p>In the eighth -- with the Giants needing four outs to win -- Edgardo Alfonzo doubled in a run off the overpowering closer Robb Nen, tying the score at 2-2. Like Alfonzo's two-run homer in Game 2, that hit was pivotal but destined to be overlooked.</p>
        <p>''Fonzie's entire career, it seems like he does the big thing that gets us to the point where we have a chance to win, and then someone else does something right at the end,'' Valentine, the Mets' manager said. ''It seems more spectacular, but it doesn't have any more importance than what Fonzie does.''</p>
        <p>Alfonzo could have been a goat. He overran second base for the last out of the 12th and seemed stunned, holding his foot on the bag a full 20 seconds after Giants second baseman Jeff Kent tagged him out. That missed opportunity was another in a series of missed opportunities late in games, for both teams.</p>
        <p>After Alfonzo tied it, 2-2, in the eighth, the Mets had runners in scoring position in four innings but could not score. The Giants, who left 16 men on base, had runners in scoring position three times after that point, but also could not score. Only in the 13th, when Agbayani faced Fultz, was the game decided.</p>
        <p>Not that the 56,270 fans minded the wait. The snuffed rallies near the end provided the same kind of drama there was last October, when the Mets prevailed over the Atlanta Braves in the 15-inning fifth game of the National League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>But that night Shea Stadium was rocking. Not so last night, Rick Reed said, who started for the Mets and allowed two runs in six strong innings. The intensity in the dugout carried over to the stands. ''I was on the bench and I said to someone, 'You can hear a pin drop -- all these people in here and not a lot of noise,' '' Reed said. ''I guess everyone was as nervous as we were.''</p>
        <p>When it was over, of course, there was pandemonium, players dancing at home plate, Valentine hopping joyously on the fringes of the celebration. The utility man Joe McEwing was the first Met up the third-base line as Agbayani trotted home.</p>
        <p>''You throw all the money out the window, because it means nothing,'' McEwing said. ''This is why we start playing when we're kids, to get to this point, to have a chance to win the World Series. It's so awesome that every pitch means something. Every pitch counts.''</p>
        <p>With two out in the ninth, Jay Payton reached on an infield single and stole second. Todd Zeile walked, but Mike Bordick struck out. Nen left for a pinch-hitter in the 10th, and Felix Rodriguez replaced him.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez gave up the game-winning single to Payton in Game 2 but was tougher this time, retiring the side in order in the 10th and outlasting Agbayani and Payton in two marathon at-bats in the 11th. Mike Piazza, who was 0 for 3 with three strikeouts at that point -- punched a single to left and was replaced by a pinch-runner, McEwing. Robin Ventura, 0 for 10 in the series to that point, followed with a single to left.</p>
        <p>Agbayani had no sacrifices this year, and he failed in an effort at his first. After he bunted a ball back to the screen behind home plate, the Mets took the bunt sign off. Agbayani tried bunting on his own, but took strike two. He had to swing away, and he did -- fouling off four two-strike pitches before flying out to shallow center.</p>
        <p>''He really felt like he let the team down,'' Valentine said. ''He was kind of pacing in the dugout, just hoping to get another chance.''</p>
        <p>Payton's at-bat in the 11th was no less dramatic. He took a ball, fouled off four pitches, took another ball, fouled off three more. He broke three bats over the seven fouls, but he had still not swung and missed. Then Rodriguez threw a 95 mile-an-hour fastball at his shoulders, and Payton bit: strike three.</p>
        <p>Zeile walked to load the bases, but Todd Pratt, who homered to clinch last year's division series against Arizona, flied to center, and the game moved to the 12th.</p>
        <p>Benitez had done all he could by then, working two scoreless innings and striking out the side in the 11th. Valentine called on White, leaving only the fifth starter, Glendon Rusch, in the bullpen. White fanned two in the 12th -- the Giants struck out 17 times over all -- and two more in the 13th, getting Barry Bonds to pop out with two men on to end the Giants' last threat.</p>
        <p>Bonds, who later complained about umpire Jerry Crawford's strike zone, also struck out with two out in the ninth, against Franco, who fanned him to end Game 2. Bonds, whose Hall of Fame career has been marked by postseason failure, is batting .231 for the series.</p>
        <p>Then again, the stars of the postseason often have a lower profile. For the Mets last year, it was Pratt and Melvin Mora. This year Perez, Agbayani and Payton are taking their turns.</p>
        <p>Agbayani and Payton came up through the Mets' farm system and are close friends. Neither was projected as a starter this spring, when that final roster spot seemed to come down to a choice between one or the other. Now both have game-winning hits in extra innings in this series.</p>
        <p>''He's on Cloud 9, because I know I was after the last game, and I just had a little base-hit single to win it,'' Payton said. ''To hit a game-winning home run, I know he's feeling real good right now.</p>
        <p>''I told him: 'Great job, enjoy it, man. We've still got one more to go.' ''</p>
