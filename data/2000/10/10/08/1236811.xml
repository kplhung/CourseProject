        <p>The fact is that the design world is full of people in their 30's who are beginning to make their mark. Some of the more precocious ones are in their 20's; others, who have taken the slow but steady route or who have emerged only recently from the shadow of a famous employer, are in their 40's. It doesn't matter, since design -- unlike, say, professional tennis or go-go dancing -- is something you can still do when you're 90. Our aim is to showcase the work of those who stand ready to take their place in the design establishment.</p>
        <p>The work of these next-in-liners runs the gamut from post-industrial funk (taking heavy-duty objects like oil tanks and recycling them for use in the traditionally more polite realm of domestic architecture) to sleek modernism (designing a pristine, pared-down backdrop for carefully selected pieces of furniture and art) to romantic ruin (layering pattern on pattern and color on color, punctuated by charmingly decrepit furniture). But it all looks exactly right, because every room is the appropriate expression of its owner's personality. It's boring to live in a house that looks as if it has been ripped from the pages of a shelter magazine, and one thing these designers seem to have learned at an early age is that, while almost everybody likes to be stylish, almost no one wants to be slavish. This point is graphically illustrated in a profile of an architect who gives his fashion-world clients rooms that are consistently chic but never, ever trendy.</p>

        <p>Of course, not everyone in the design world makes rooms. Some design umbrella stands or upholstery fabrics or toilets; others, who edit magazines or manage photo archives, design information rather than things, putting those things (and the images of them) into perspective for the rest of us. In just about every nook and cranny of design, the young and the restless are eager to take their turn. And who knows? If we've guessed right, they'll still be appearing in these pages when they are 90.</p>
