        <p>WHEN Susan Foose's heroin-addicted son Bryan finally said he was ready to receive help, she knew she had to act quickly. The Marlton mother began working the phones, calling several clinics and rehabilitation programs to find a place that would take her son.</p>
        <p>Bryan slipped out for one last score. The next morning his mother would find him dead in his bedroom of a drug overdose.</p>
        <p>Parents faced with a child addicted to drugs will usually do anything to solve the problem. But most drug treatment professionals say it is up to the addict to decide to seek help and until that point, treatment will be less than successful. Capturing that window of opportunity and getting a child into an appropriate program in time is not always so easy, particularly in southern New Jersey, where a shortage of drug treatment centers for young addicts has led to a revolt by parents and a new pilot program by the state.</p>
        <p>While most drug-treatment experts agree that young addicts' best chance for recovery is a long-term residential program, none currently exist for adolescents and young adults. Treatment for them often involves family participation, but  families in South Jersey are faced with sending their children to programs in North Jersey or out of state, the best of which might have a six-month waiting list.</p>
        <p>''I was fighting for my son's life, said Ms. Foose, who started a parent support and advocacy group, Parent-to-Parent Coalition, for families affected by drugs, after her 22-year-old son died in 1997. ''Why, at such a critical time, do we need to claw and scratch and fight for someone's life? This isn't just wrong, it's cruel and inhumane.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Ms. Foose's group brought the shortage of treatment centers  in South Jersey to the attention of Governor Whitman at a town meeting. Since then, the state's Division of Addiction Services has been seeking a site for a 70-bed long-term residential complex for young South Jersey addicts.</p>
        <p>The state's deputy commissioner of health, George DiFerdinando, said in an interview that selecting a treatment site was a top priority. While faced with a fair amount of ''not in my backyard'' sentiment from some municipalities, Dr. DiFerdiando said that ''negotiations continue with multiple sites'' and that he expected to ''have a solution by early 2001.''</p>
        <p>In addition, in July the state freed up $2 million for a pilot program known as the ''South Jersey Inititative,'' which, until a permanent facility is available, is being used to finance several out-patient drug treatment programs as well as purchasing 30 beds for South Jersey youths at existing residential programs.</p>
        <p>The South Jersey Initiative is being coordinated by an out-patient treatment center in Woodbury, where the clinical director, George Koren, has seen a recent increase in patients using heroin, a drug he says is particularly difficult to kick. In cases of serious heroin addiction, Mr. Koren immediately refers the patient to a residential program.</p>
        <p>Daytop New Jersey in Morris County is one such program under contract with the South Jersey Inititative. Daytop's executive director, Joe Hennen, said the Initiative had reserved five beds for South Jersey patients, though his 70-bed center is now serving 18 youths from South Jersey.</p>
        <p>When the program started in 1992, Mr. Hennen said, ''We never saw a kid using heroin.'' Today, close to 65 percent of the patients are there for heroin addiction, and several of those are young women, so many in fact that Daytop is renovating its complex so half the beds can serve young women.</p>
        <p>''It's an extremely serious problem,'' said Mr. Hennen. ''And it's not kids from the inner-city. We're seeing 14, 15 year-old kids addicted to heroin, blond-haired, blue-eyed, suburban, affluent kids.''</p>
