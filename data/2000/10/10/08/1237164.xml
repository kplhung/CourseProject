        <p>Forget that Russian gymnast and that Australian swimmer. The real winners in Sydney were Andrew Bernard and Meghan Busse, the business school professors who created a model to predict how many medals each nation would win at the 2000 Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>Said model was hardly flawless, in part because Mr. Bernard and Ms. Busse thought only 888 medals would be awarded at the Games. In fact, there were 929. Whoops!</p>

        <p>Forget that Russian gymnast and that Australian swimmer. The real winners in Sydney were Andrew Bernard and Meghan Busse, the business school professors who created a model to predict how many medals each nation would win at the 2000 Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>Said model was hardly flawless, in part because Mr. Bernard and Ms. Busse thought only 888 medals would be awarded at the Games. In fact, there were 929. Whoops!</p>
        <p>The professors badly underestimated the prowess of Russia and China. They figured on 59 medals for Russia, which took home 88, and 49 medals for China, which won 59. They also predicted Germany would win 63 medals -- second overall to the United States. The Germans actually won 57 medals and ranked fifth.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bernard and Ms. Busse got one right. They forecast the United States would take home 97 medals, including 39 golds. Our actual haul? 97 medals, including 39 golds. Conspiracy theorists take note. Did Bela Karolyi deliberately sabotage the U.S. women's gymnastics team to save the model? Mr. Bernard declined comment.</p>
