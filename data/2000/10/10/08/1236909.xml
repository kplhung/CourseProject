        <p>ABOUT 25 years ago, I got a telephone call from my friend Mike, who asked me if I wanted to go to a party at Tom Luddy's house in Berkeley, Calif.

        <p>ABOUT 25 years ago, I got a telephone call from my friend Mike, who asked me if I wanted to go to a party at Tom Luddy's house in Berkeley, Calif. I didn't particularly like Berkeley, and at the time Mr. Luddy was the head of the Pacific Film Archive; film was another thing I wasn't into. Then Mike said the magic words: ''Dewey Balfa will be there.'' He meant Dewey Balfa of the Balfa Brothers, the Cajun band that had introduced the folk scene to the wealth of astonishing music Southern Louisiana had to offer. ''I have to pick him up and drive him over there,'' Mike said. ''So be at my house at seven.''</p>
        <p>I knew Mr. Balfa was a fiddler, but the minute we arrived, he announced he was going to make gumbo and needed help. Mike and I eagerly volunteered our services. As we chopped and stirred under Mr. Balfa's beneficent gaze, more people arrived at the house, and before long music started drifting into the kitchen. The filmmaker Les Blank checked our progress from time to time, the folksinger and folklorist Mike Seeger was there, and a big guy who turned out to be Marc Savoy, a Cajun musician and accordian maker, pumped a little squeezebox with consummate skill.</p>
        <p>What all these people -- and I've only mentioned a few of the names on the guest list -- had in common was Chris Strachwitz. Mr. Strachwitz, 69, was, and is, Arhoolie Records, the Berkeley-based folk label that has released a steady flood of music by the black and white residents of Louisiana, making the word zydeco, the blues-derived, usually French-language music played by black Louisianans, a household word, at least in the households where I hang out. Mr. Strachwitz had helped Mr. Blank make a number of films documenting the music and lifestyles of many of the people he recorded.  Mr. Strachwitz also had a superb collection of 78's of various folk and ethnic musics and occasionally compiled some of them on LP.</p>
        <p>After that evening, I bumped into him often. I recognized him as a regular at the zydeco dances Clifton Chenier played at the area's black Roman Catholic churches and saw him at Mr. Blank's film openings or I shopped at Down Home Music, a roots-music record store he later opened in El Cerrito, just north of Berkeley. He never seemed to sit still: a new passion for the music of the Texas-Mexican border resulted in a deluge of Arhoolie releases, and soon afterward, a new Les Blank film, ''Chulas Fronteras.''</p>
        <p>One thing I never stopped to think about was why the music that came out on Arhoolie was so much more exciting than the music other folk labels released, but the answer can be found on the just released five-CD boxed set ''The Journey of Chris Strachwitz: Arhoolie Records 40th Anniversary Collection, 1960-2000.'' Writing in the foreword of the booklet for the anthology, Mr. Strachwitz notes that he discovered this music on the radio in the 1950's: ''a fascinating era in American vernacular culture, when almost every regional or ethnic tradition was evolving with the help of amplification . . . and reaching new and ever more exciting heights.'' He adds, ''In spite of the suddenly wider audience for authentic, regional, or traditional musics, many musicians remained very traditionbound while others readily adapted to new sounds they liked, thus creating marvelous new hybrids.'' In short, for Chris Strachwitz, folk music has been more like a tavern with a great band in the corner than a museum.</p>
        <p>Having an outsider's perspective helped: Mr. Strachwitz's childhood was spent in what is now Poland, and his family arrived in the United States from Sweden as refugees in 1947, staying with an aunt in Reno, Nev. There, young Chris discovered American radio: Western Swing, New Orleans jazz and, while attending college in Pomona, Calif., blues and rhythm-and-blues. It was on Hunter Hancock's legendary R-and-B radio show that he first heard Lightnin' Hopkins, who made a huge impression on him. In 1959, a fellow enthusiast passed on Mr. Hopkins' address and phone number at his home in Houston, and as soon as school was out that year, Mr. Strachwitz headed there.</p>
        <p>He had bought a tape recorder to make occasional recordings of Bay Area bluesmen, but it wasn't suitable for recording Mr. Hopkins live in a bar as he intended. But the recorder did prove useful; in 1960, chasing down a reference in a Lightnin' Hopkins song, Mr. Strachwitz chanced upon Mance Lipscomb, a virtuoso guitarist and ''songster'' whose repertory went back to the days before the blues, in Navasota, Tex. Mr. Strachwitz recorded Lipscomb peforming at his house, and the resulting LP was the first on the Arhoolie label. The name was derived from a misheard word for a type of field holler, the hoolie. The album also came out at just the right time, as the folk boom was taking off and young fans went in search of the names they found on old 78's. By this time, Mr. Strachwitz had stockpiled recordings by other Texas bluesmen that he had recorded on the same trip: Lil' Son Jackson, Black Ace and Whistlin' Alex Moore. Not long afterward, he made his first recordings of Lightnin' Hopkins and began investigating the zydeco scene in Houston, where he would soon meet Clifton Chenier, Mr. Hopkins' cousin.</p>
        <p>Although the ever-growing catalog of Arhoolie Records sold to the folkies, Mr. Strachwitz wasn't really one himself.  He saw himself as simply a fan of American music, and electrical amplification and ''commercialism,'' two folkie bugbears, meant nothing to him, so nearly all of the performers he recorded still played for their peers. As a result, the recordings he made were living documents that sounded alive and fresh. It also means that he occasionally came upon previously unrecorded masters like Mance Lipscomb and Fred McDowell, whose Arhoolie recordings of tough, guitar-based blues influenced a young Bonnie Raitt.</p>
        <p>Further, many of these artists were able to get on the folk circuit and make good money while simultaneously continuing to please their own communities. Clifton Chenier would come to the San Francisco area and play shows for the folk crowd, but most of us knew that he delivered the real goods in those church halls, where our white faces would be in a distinct minority.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Strachwitz's most salutary imperfections is his restlessness, and this is why the Arhoolie catalog is so rich in music from all over the United States. Whenever money and time allowed, he would be off to somewhere else, recording. He arrived in Louisiana at a time when Cajun music was on a cusp, uncertain whether to live or die. The Balfa Brothers' appearance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival had shown that there was an audience for the music outside the state, but the younger generation of Louisiana musicians was ambivalent about it. By encouraging some of them like Marc Savoy and Michael Doucet and by recording older musicians like Nathan Abshire and getting them on the folk circuit, he helped prod the culture into what is now a full-blown renaissance.</p>
        <p>Sometimes this could have amusing results. Much taken with John Delafose's pre-zydeco style, Mr. Strachwitz recorded an album that included a tune called ''Joe Pete's Got Two Women.'' What he didn't know was that this was a true story about a local scandal involving a man named Joe Pitre, and when he pressed a single of it, it turned into a strong regional hit. ''Man, every day it seemed like there was another batch of orders for that thing, and you don't get paid for 90 days,'' he once told me. ''It was awful: I kept re-pressing it and re-pressing it, and it was making me broke. I hope I never have another hit as long as I live.''</p>
        <p>HE also released recordings made by others, although for the purpose of the anthology, only his own recordings were used, which means, among other things, that we are denied Robert Pete Williams, a startling blues singer from Louisiana, and a hefty slice of the Tex-Mex recordings he has reissued. (Also, the booklet could have included translations of some of the lyrics, particularly of the Tex-Mex corridos, whose lyrics are vital to understanding the songs). Still, given the astonishing variety of the 107 tracks here, only a curmudgeon would complain. It's all here, blues, country, bluegrass, zydeco, Cajun, Tex-Mex, and the latest Arhoolie discovery, sacred steel, gospel music played on the pedal steel guitar. It's an amazing journey, and an amazing document. Plus, you can dance to it.</p>
