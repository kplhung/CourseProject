      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In contrast to some in Margaret Talbot's article (Sept. 10), Jessica Robinson's case was hardly her first brush with the law. At the time she committed the offense against her grandparents, she was on juvenile probation for a violent crime. And Robinson attempted to rob an 80-year-old man at knifepoint a few weeks before she victimized her grandparents.</p>
        <p>While Talbot characterized Robinson's courtroom behavior as ''impassive,'' it was actually much worse. As she was taken out of the courtroom, she was laughing and high-fiving one of her co-defendants.</p>
        <p>Finally, Robinson's callousness toward her grandparents did not end on the day of sentencing. Two weeks later she telephoned and threatened to have her friends retaliate against them for having cooperated with the prosecution.</p>
        <p>If your writer was seeking a poster child for the injustice of the juvenile court system, I suggest that she look elsewhere.</p>
