        <p>THE Hagedorn Family Resource Center in Hempstead has classrooms on each of its three floors, but no room symbolizes its far-reaching ambitions quite like the unfinished kitchen at the new facility for needy families and children.</p>

        <p>THE Hagedorn Family Resource Center in Hempstead has classrooms on each of its three floors, but no room symbolizes its far-reaching ambitions quite like the unfinished kitchen at the new facility for needy families and children.</p>
        <p>The kitchen would not only serve meals to the 145 youngsters who would eventually fill the center's day-care and after-school programs, it would serve as a training ground for disenfranchised teens looking for careers as chefs. Parents dropping off their children in the morning could order dinners that they could pick up in the afternoon, said Carol Keepler, the center's director, to help them spend more ''quality time'' at home with their children instead of preparing meals.</p>
        <p>''It will be everything for everybody,'' Ms. Keepler said of the center.</p>
        <p>That is a lofty goal for any social services agency in Nassau County these days, with another round of cuts looming because of the county's fiscal crisis. But the Hagedorn center's chief benefactor is neither County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta nor the county Legislature nor the state financial monitors who rejected Mr. Gulotta's 2001 budget and four-year financial plan last week.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Family and Children's Association, the county's largest human services agency, is expanding its services at the Hagedorn center through the facility's namesake, Horace Hagedorn, the octogenarian founder of the plant food company Miracle-Gro who pumped $1 million into the resuscitation of the former Catholic school.</p>
        <p>''I'm 85 years old,'' said Mr. Hagedorn, who lives in Port Washington, where he founded his company 52 years ago. ''I'm a little impatient and I can't wait 20 years. I like to do things where I can see the results.''</p>
        <p>In the center's parking lot, a 42-foot mobile pediatric medical office built atop a bus chassis began dispensing free care to low-income patients last month. It was partly funded with a $1 million donation from Sanjay Kumar, the chief executive of Computer Associates, the Islandia software giant, and his wife, Sylvia.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, human services agencies that have endured cutbacks are relying on philanthropy and other help from the private sector to fill gaps. Charity events that were once the fundraising specialty of only the largest organizations are now being run by virtually every agency, said Richard Dina, chief executive of the Family and Children's Association, based in Mineola.</p>
        <p>''It plays a major role in the future of any nonprofit,'' Mr. Dina said of the private contributions. ''What's very clear to us is that the old dependence on government for all of your funding to do good work in the community is being broken, and the only way a nonprofit can serve is to look for other sources of revenue.''</p>
        <p>But human service officials are wary of signaling to the county or the state-appointed Nassau Interim Finance Authority that the private sector can carry the agencies and their programs very far.</p>
        <p>Jack O'Connell, chief executive of the Health and Welfare Council of Long Island, an association of social services providers, said he was pessimistic about the the pressure that the state board could exert on the county to enact further cuts to social services. The board ordered the county to fill deficits that could reach $81 million next year.</p>
        <p>''The only way you can look at private philanthropy is that it can pay for certain programs,'' Mr. O'Connell said. ''But what they're eliminating at the county level, what Gulotta's proposing is a $20 million elimination. That's going to be impossible to make up. The cuts are too big.''</p>
        <p>Paul Engelhart, chief program officer at Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Rockville Centre, said it would be difficult for his agency to top the private-sector fundraising that already accounts for $4 million, or 17 percent, of the agency's $24 million budget.</p>
        <p>''There are limits to what we can do over and above the commitment that the church and other individuals have already made,'' he said. Under this year's budget, Catholic Charities lost $214,000 to provide mental health services, representing about half of its government funding for the services.</p>
        <p>The Family and Children's Association lost $1.2 million in the same round of cuts, Mr. Dina said. As a result, it closed an East Meadow substance abuse outpatient clinic, a Roosevelt youth program and a summer camp for learning-disabled children and scaled back 15 of its 50 programs.</p>
        <p>The $1 million contributed by Mr. Hagedorn is earmarked for the new Hempstead center, and the other programs will not be revived. But Mr. Dina said the Family and Children's Association was garnering savings by consolidating and expanding programs in the center, which is quickly becoming a magnet for other public services in the village.</p>
        <p>Ginny Hubert, development director for the Hempstead school district, said the community was ''now able to refer families who might be in crisis to a one-stop shopping center for every possible service that has to do with families: youth services, chemical dependency services, anything that impacts the success of our students. That's a godsend because we have a lot of students in crisis in Hempstead.''</p>
        <p>The Hempstead school district also wants to expand its pre-K program, which lasts until 11:30 in its own schools, into a full-day program at the Hagedorn center with physical education and computer literacy enrichment programs that children do not receive, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dina said he hoped the center would fulfill its original premise as a means to take more parents, particularly single mothers, off the welfare rolls by providing day care while they train for jobs or study English as a Second Language. A few mothers are involved in the program in its early stages, while it is still running at only a half day.</p>
        <p>Caroline Russell, 34, of Valley Stream, smiled as she watched her 2-year-old daughter, Winter, play with a toy kitchen set at the Hagedorn center last week. Mrs. Russell said it was the first day care the child had ever received.</p>
        <p>''I took care of my daughter alone,'' Mrs. Russell said. ''I made it to the park when I could and had a girlfriend who used to take her out when I wasn't feeling well. But she  moved away. Then everything kind of broke up. My marriage situation fell apart..</p>
        <p>''This,'' she said, ''gives me that push: 'Get yourself in school. Get yourself focused.' '' She said she wants to be a nurse.</p>
        <p>As the agency awaits state and county approvals, some public funding is beginning to trickle in. Vincent Neefus, who heads the Hempstead Police Department's community outreach unit, said the police unit received a $45,000 grant last month from the state Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse for programs at the Hagedorn center.</p>
        <p>Programs there would include after-school tutoring and classes in self-esteem, peer pressure and anti-gang awareness, Lt. Neefus said, and would help balance the sports-focused Police Athletic League programs in which youths at risk of joining gangs participate.</p>
        <p>The mobile pediatrics unit is an extension of the one-stop shopping idea. The Family and Children's Association has an agreement with the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, which is managing the unit, to park the bus at the Hagedorn center four days a week, said James Fagin, medical director of the unit and chief of general pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital.</p>
        <p>''We would like to provide continuity of care,'' Dr. Fagin said. ''The idea is not to deliver sporadic care, but to establish a medical home for the kids in these communities that never closes. Our intention is to stay at a site, and if it's very successful, ultimately we would like to establish a fixed site there inside the building or nearby and then move the bus onto another site and do the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Shalesha Ross, 25, applauded the attention as she sat in the medical bus last week. ''This is a walk-in; at the H.I.P. center you have to make an appointment,'' she said. ''I like this better. They take more time to explain what's going on with your children.'' Ms. Ross, who is unemployed, watched her daughter, India, cradle a toy kangaroo given by the bus staff and wipe away tears let loose by an inoculation.</p>
