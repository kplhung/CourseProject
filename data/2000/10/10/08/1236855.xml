        <p>AHAB'S WIFE: Or, The Star-Gazer, by Sena Jeter Naslund. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $15.) Inspired by a few brief passages about Ahab's young wife in ''Moby-Dick,'' this novel reworks Melville's whaling adventure from a female, liberal Protestant perspective, imagining a world ruled by compassion rather than obsession. ''Naslund is unstintingly reasonable, empathetic and kind,'' Stacey D'Erasmo wrote here last year, and her heroine ''is a deep and wayward creature.'' The same publisher has reissued The Disobedience of Water: Stories and Novellas ($13), in which mostly Southern characters struggle to make human connections through the power of memory. ''Naslund has an eye for odd, telling details and a gift for rendering (and respecting) this oddness in . . . sharp and precise'' language, Maud Casey said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>LIFE IN THE TREETOPS: Adventures of a Woman in Field Biology, by Margaret D. Lowman. (Yale University, $13.95.) An accomplished scientist -- and working mother -- recalls her trials and triumphs studying tree canopies and other ecosystems in Australia, Central America and New England. Last year our reviewer, Liesl Schillinger, called this ''a funny, unassuming and deeply idiosyncratic chronicle.''</p>
        <p>WHY THEY KILL: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist, by Richard Rhodes. (Vintage, $14.) In this investigation into the nature of violence, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author draws on the experiences of an unorthodox criminologist who survived a childhood of abuse to become an advocate of the notion that social forces, not psychiatric ones, cause violent behavior. The result ''is a fiercely polemic, sure-to-be inflammatory work of advocacy, a conservative, old-fashioned, 'common-sense' solution to the mystery of evil,'' Joyce Carol Oates wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>TWENTIETH-CENTURY AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE: The Buildings and Their Makers, by Carter Wiseman. (Norton, $24.95.) A critic conducts an illustrated tour of landmarks large and small, from turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts masterpieces to today's computer-influenced designs. ''This book is about as good a summary of American architecture of this century as anyone is likely to write,'' Robert Campbell said here in 1998. ''It is full and accurate in its facts, wise and fair in its judgments.'' Lost New York, by Nathan Silver (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $25), is an expanded and updated edition of the author's 1967 survey of demolished buildings and skylines, among them the old Metropolitan Opera and the original Pennsylvania Station. '' 'Lost New York' makes a considered plea for two things: the preservation of historic structures and conservation of the city's essential form,'' William Alex wrote in these pages.</p>
        <p>PERLMAN'S ORDEAL, by Brooks Hansen. (Picador USA, $14.) In London in 1906, a fiercely scientific hypnotist becomes gradually unhinged as he does battle with a charming spiritualist to save a hysterical teenage girl whose invisible companion is a demigoddess from an Atlantis-like kingdom. ''Extravagantly, even bewilderingly inventive,'' this novel is ''crammed with the stuff of dreams,'' Alice Truax wrote in the Book Review last year.</p>
        <p>GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE, by Susan Vreeland. (Penguin, $11.) By tracing the influence of a painting on the lives of its owners and admirers from the 17th century to the present, the author explores the immortality of great artworks and the many uses of art. ''Intelligent, searching and unusual, the novel is filled with luminous moments,'' Katy Emck wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>A FAR CRY FROM KENSINGTON, by Muriel Spark. (New Directions, $12.95.) Mrs. Hawkins is an attractive but overweight war widow in 1950's London who is fond of giving advice and whose feud with a boorish writer gets her fired from more than one publishing job. In 1988 in these pages, Robert Plunket called this Spark's ''most delightful novel in years.''</p>
        <p>CLIMBING HIGH: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy, by Lene Gammelgaard. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.) The Scandinavian author was a member of the ill-fated 1996 Everest expedition (chronicled in Jon Krakauer's ''Into Thin Air'') that resulted in the death of eight climbers during a blizzard. ''While her successful summit bid was a personal triumph . . . it is her intimate and impressionistic report that will more likely endure,'' Erica Sanders wrote here last year. In The Other Side of Everest: Climbing the North Face Through the Killer Storm, by Matt Dickinson (Three Rivers, $13), a British filmmaker and climbing novice describes his ascent during the same ill-fated season. The result is ''a rollicking, insightful and harrowing'' account, Bruce Barcott said here in 1999.</p>
