        <p>Walter Sanchez, the publisher of The Queens Ledger, has reinstated a columnist who compared Terri Thomson, the Queens representative to the city's Board of Education, to Hitler. The writer, Frank Borzellieri, was suspended after a column with that comparison appeared in July.</p>
        <p>''Many of my readers are genuinely attracted to the information and the viewpoint that his column gives,'' Mr. Sanchez said, explaining the reinstatement. ''We got nearly 50 letters on it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanchez, who acknowledged that he had not read the July column  before it was printed, said he would now be ''closely checking his columns'' because ''there is a good deal of trust that is gone between Frank and I.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanchez said he had tried unsuccessfully to reach Ms. Thomson, whom he called a friend, to apologize. As to whether they were still friends, he said, ''I guess not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Borzellieri did not apologize for his words.</p>
        <p>''She can be his best friend,'' he said of Mr. Sanchez and Ms. Thomson. ''It doesn't change the fact that she's evil.''</p>
        <p>Howie Katz, director of the New York regional office of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote to The Ledger complaining about what Mr. Borzellieri had written. Mr. Katz called the Hitler analogy ''gratuitous, ignorant and deeply offensive,'' saying it ''trivialized the Holocaust.''</p>
        <p>Vicki Streitfeld, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said Ms. Thomson declined to comment on the issue.</p>
