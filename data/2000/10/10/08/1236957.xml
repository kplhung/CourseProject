        <p>FOR the first three weeks of September, the certificate in the window of Shula Babajanof's pizza shop in Cedarhurst indicated that the food was kosher under rules of the Vaad of the Five Towns and Far Rockaway.

        <p>Ms. Babajanof has worked at the same location for 10 years, selling kosher dairy foods, falafel, salads and baked goods under the certification of the 35-year-old Vaad, or kosher authority, of the Five Towns.

        <p>FOR the first three weeks of September, the certificate in the window of Shula Babajanof's pizza shop in Cedarhurst indicated that the food was kosher under rules of the Vaad of the Five Towns and Far Rockaway. The certificate also noted that Ms. Babajanof was not shomer Shabbat, or a Sabbath-observant Jew.</p>
        <p>Ms. Babajanof has worked at the same location for 10 years, selling kosher dairy foods, falafel, salads and baked goods under the certification of the 35-year-old Vaad, or kosher authority, of the Five Towns. That she attended a Conservative synagogue had never been a concern of the kosher monitors or her patrons. But when the Vaad of the Five Towns merged with the more right-leaning Vaad of Far Rockaway on Sept. 1, the rules -- and the sign in her window -- changed.</p>
        <p>The effects were subtle but sweeping. The mark on the certificate, or teudah, was like a scarlet letter in the Five Towns. Because the certificate indicated that Ms. Babajanof's level of religious observance was not up to snuff, that alone would stop some fervently Orthodox Jews from eating in her pizza shop. The new certificates even indicated whether the bread was baked by a Jew.</p>
        <p>Modern Orthodox Jews were outraged by the changes, and after a series of meetings last month, they persuaded the Vaad, a board with a lay president, a lay vice president and nine local Orthodox rabbis, to back down. The new notations were removed from the certificate in Ms. Babajanof's storefront on Sept. 21.</p>
        <p>But other changes are still in effect for the 35 food shops and restaurants that do business under the watchful eye of the Vaad and its monitors, who oversee the preparation of meat, cracking of eggs, mixing of tuna salad and washing of lettuce. Stricter food-preparation regulations, following the Orthodox Union standard, mean that Ms. Babajanof had to hire a board-approved monitor -- called a mashgiach in Hebrew -- to oversee the kitchen and certify that it is kosher. She pays the monitor $10 to $12 an hour, 10 hours a day.</p>
        <p>''They put a label on a person,'' she said, referring to the Vaad. ''It's really not right. They don't know me. I'm not against the Vaad. I have a lot of respect for them. I follow everything they tell me to do. The only thing that bothered me is the expense of a mashgiach.''</p>
        <p>But the branding of Ms. Babajanof bothered many Jews in the Five Towns, where the Orthodox population is widely perceived as being more diverse and more liberal than on the Queens side of the border. While the idea of combining the two Vaads was to promote unity between communities and to make it easier for Jews of every level of observance to shop, it backfired.</p>
        <p>At meetings on Sept. 14 at Young Israel of Lawrence-Cedarhurst, on Sept. 21 at Kneseth Israel in Far Rockaway and in other smaller gatherings, residents spoke up for shopkeepers like Ms. Babajanof and protested new regulations that had nothing to do with whether the food was prepared according to kashrut, or the kosher dietary laws. One guideline said that any form of entertainment in a Vaad-supervised restaurant must receive written approval from the rabbis. Another recommended modest dress for waitresses and shopkeepers (arms covered and skirts below the knee).</p>
        <p>''What do they want to do, run our lives?'' said a woman from Woodmere who attended both meetings and spoke on the condition that her name not be used. ''That's not kashrut. The people who are modern Orthodox were happy the way things were.''</p>
        <p>Geri Gindea of Lawrence, who described herself as a centrist Orthodox Jew, said: ''The outrage comes from a clashing of perspectives or ideas of what the Vaad's scope of authority should be. I think it should be a Vaad that determines what we put in our mouths.''</p>
        <p>The president of the new Vaad, Stephen Savitsky, said that while the notations about Sabbath observance and who baked the bread have been dropped, the rabbis would still be checking to see that the shopkeepers displayed ''positive Torah values.''</p>
        <p>''People in the community became very incensed because there were non-kashrut issues and felt if they did that, the next thing they would do would be to tell the people who came in the store what to wear,'' Mr. Savitsky said. ''They felt it should really stay within their purview.''</p>
        <p>''Sometimes there are some people in the community who are so afraid of a right-wing cloud hanging over their head, that someone is going to be telling them what to do,'' he said. ''It's not true.'' But to answer concerns expressed in the meetings, the Vaad is organizing a 30-member community review board, including the presidents of the Orthodox synagogues in the area, Mr. Savitsky said.</p>
        <p>The Vaad takes in $100,000 a year in monthly fees, beginning at $250, paid by the shopkeepers, Mr. Savitsky said. In addition, each Orthodox family is expected to join the Vaad at a cost of $75 a year, but only half pay their dues, said Mr. Savitsky, who estimated that there were about 4,500 Orthodox families in the Five Towns. The total population is about 44,000 (or 12,500 families) in Cedarhurst, Hewlett, Inwood, Lawrence and Woodmere.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gindea said that the world views of Orthodox Jews in Queens and the Five Towns were widely divergent but that the newly merged Vaad could perform a needed service. ''They have to unify the community in terms of kashrut so all the people, no matter where they fall on the spectrum, can eat in these establishments,'' she said. ''It's a question of whether they can remain sensitive to just being a board of kashrut and not use it as a vehicle to regulate our lifestyles.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the view, it's agreed that the new Orthodox Union rules are more stringent than the old, which had been interpreted locally. The new standard requires monitors to check vegetables like lettuce and broccoli for bugs, which may not be ingested under kosher law.</p>
        <p>Avi Oz of Hewlett had run glatt kosher restaurants -- glatt kosher is considered the most stringent -- for more than two decades in Manhattan and Israel before opening Anise Mediterranean Cuisine in Cedarhurst four months ago. The added expense of a monitor is enough to make him consider closing down, he said, adding that he has already had to let his waitresses go.</p>
        <p>''The mashgiach came yesterday, and he wanted $250,'' Mr. Oz said, pulling out a receipt. ''He is before the electric. He's before the rent. He's before the payroll, the guys who are working here. I am the first victim in the town.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oz said he objected to paying the monitor to do tasks that he and his wife could do themselves.</p>
        <p>''We have 22 years' experience in cleaning lettuce,'' Mr. Oz said. ''To clean lettuce we don't need to pay $4,000. That's the rule in the Vaad. No one will come to eat here if I don't have the mashgiach even if I am shomer Shabbat. They don't let the owners live. The Vaad, they come. They want the money. I think if I don't give them the money, they'll take the teudah away.''</p>
        <p>Moshe Verschleisser of Flatbush, Brooklyn, the monitor working in Mr. Oz's restaurant for $13 an hour, 10 hours a day, keeps the keys to the freezer and refrigerator so that meat can't be switched or tampered with in his absence.</p>
        <p>Couldn't Mr. Oz wash the lettuce himself and check the eggs for blood spots (which would make them nonkosher)? ''The answer is no,'' Mr. Verschleisser said, because someone running a business does not have enough time to spend on thorough inspections.</p>
        <p>Roy Salter of Hewlett works in another kosher-certified food shop in Cedarhurst. ''People in the area think it's like the Mafia over here,'' he said. ''They come and take your money. I see a lot of Vaad people walk in and walk out of the store. Sometimes you wonder who owns the store.''</p>
        <p>And there is a monitor for the monitor. Near the end of lunch hour on a recent weekday, Rabbi Mordcha Ehrlich, one of three full-time and three part-time supervising monitors, came to check on Mr. Verschleisser. He wandered through Mr. Oz's kitchen, scanning the cans and bottles on the shelves for anything without the proper kosher symbol and flipping the stove's gas burners  on and off to check if the pilots were lighted. Under kosher law, a Jew may not eat food cooked by a non-Jew, but if the pilot is lighted by a Jew, a non-Jew can do the cooking.</p>
        <p>''I come in to spot-check on a daily basis and make sure he does his job,'' Rabbi Ehrlich said. ''And make sure the relationship between the mashgiach and store owner stays on an even keel. If the mashgiach sees something is not up to par, it's his job to make it stay up.''</p>
        <p>''The storekeepers want me to come in,'' Rabbi Ehrlich said. ''They realize they can make a mistake. They welcome the Vaad coming in.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether his monitoring included general cleanliness, Rabbi Ehrlich said he only worried about Torah-prescribed rules. ''Kashrut is not about cleanliness at all,'' he said. ''It happens to be a byproduct or a benefit that it's generally cleaner.''</p>
        <p>Benji Schreier, owner of Supersol, a kosher supermarket in Lawrence, contends that the stricter new standard, which requires that he list the  distributors he uses so that shoppers can know which rabbinical supervision was used when meat was slaughtered, can only help business.</p>
        <p>''The Far Rockaway rabbis had trouble telling their congregants they could shop in the Five Towns,'' he said. ''The natural thing to do was to get the standard that could be used by everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schreier, whose supermarket also caters, said that previously some Far Rockaway residents could not even eat a Sabbath meal at friends' homes in the Five Towns if the place where the food was purchased was not approved by their rabbi. ''By the time this calms down, I should be able to cater to any shul in Far Rockaway and the Five Towns,'' Mr. Schreier said.</p>
        <p>Twelve years ago, as the Five Towns became increasingly Orthodox, John Dutra, the only non-Jewish shop owner supervised by the Vaad, sought kosher certification for his Dunkin Donuts shop on Burnside Avenue in Lawrence, eliminating any items that used nonkosher ingredients and asking the Vaad to be his watchdog.</p>
        <p>He is not required to have a full-time monitor, but since the new Vaad took over he has been required to have a monitor present when tuna fish is prepared. It is the same tuna he made for years without a monitor.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make sense, but if it makes them feel comfortable, we go along with it,'' Mr. Dutra said. ''For us, it didn't make sense not to be kosher.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dutra said the more than $800 he pays the Vaad each month is just part of doing business. ''It's like paying for the garbage,'' he said. ''It's expensive, but the way the neighborhood has changed, we definitely need it. If we don't have the certification, the business will drop.''</p>
