        <p>THE most romantic dining along coastal Connecticut may well be at Capri Ristorante in Westport. The lemon-vivid one-story building overlooks Compo Cove, and at night, from large front windows, twinkling lights from the opposite side of the tiny cove are clearly visible.</p>
        <p>Capri is the latest in a long line of restaurants on theis site, going back to the days of Cafe de la Plage and its self-styled ''San Francisco cuisine.'' For sheer romance there are few dining spots in Connecticut that can match this location.</p>
        <p>Despite its name, Capri's menu ranges across the Italian landscape and even, briefly, into France. We began lunch one Sunday with a trio of starters. Tender seared sea scallops, three large golden-browned ones, perched on grilled zucchini rounds, in a tiny pool of sun-dried tomato-flavored olive oil. Pleasant-tasting seafood sausage maison (shrimps, scallops and salmon, grilled and sliced lengthwise), came with a small salad of baby greens in fresh lemon vinaigrette, but the dry sausage desperately needed saucing. Our best choice was mozzarella, salmon and basil roulade, rolled loosely so all the flavors and textures could escape, served with baby greens and a soupcon of red and yellow pepper purees.</p>
        <p>As we nibbled and chatted, we watched fishermen trolling in the quiet bay in front of us, divers in wet suits entering the water and strollers ambling across the sandy beach. That view, side-window glimpses of a flower garden in full bloom alongside the building and Capri's sunny interior almost made up for entrees that weren't always on the mark.</p>
        <p>Risotto Milanese monte mare, with jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, baby clams and mussels in their shells, made an attractive presentation, but was undermined from the start by the use of regular rice, not fat Arborio grains, essential to a true risotto. The result was a pleasant enough rice dish, with a watery saffron-tinted sauce, but nowhere near an authentic risotto. Furthermore, the juvenile mussels should have been discarded.</p>
        <p>Shrimp with artichokes and fried zucchini was an improvement, with piping hot, lightly sauteed jumbo shrimp, delicious crisp-fried zucchini sticks and artichoke bottoms. A third entree, pappardelle alla portobello, suffered from overcooked pasta. The brown sauce promised on the menu was more of a bland tomato sauce entwined with mushroom and shallot bits.</p>
        <p>A later dinner also produced mixed results. On the plus side were three entrees: roast rack of lamb (four perfectly cooked rare baby chops at a pricey $34.95), grilled swordfish steak (moist and flavorful from a marinade of lemon juice, olive oil, dill, chopped olives and tomatoes) and a monkfish special in a lobster-tomato-accented sauce with bits of shrimp. The kitchen seems to have a flair for seafood. Most entrees came with mashed potatoes, fresh asparagus and miniature carrots and zucchini.</p>
        <p>On the debit side, cannelloni Capri consisted of flabby pasta cylinders stuffed with a mush of vegetables, mushrooms and minced beef, in a prosaic tomato-basil cream sauce.</p>
        <p>Our evening's appetizer highlight was a special, creamy-rich Gorgonzola chowder with the surprise of diced ham. Lobster salad was less inspired: densely mixed with crabmeat and a few chunks of lobster, served in a sawtooth-cut tomato half, garnished (prettily) with walnuts and orange segments.</p>
        <p>Apple strudel made with tart Granny Smith apples was our most satisfying dessert. Others were professionally made but lacked pizazz.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of its site, prices at Capri are stratospheric for the region, with non-pasta entrees between $27 and $37. Our three-course dinner for two came to $89, before drinks, tax or tip. Lunch, considerably cheaper, has the added asset of great daylight vistas. The medium-small wine list begins at $21 and offers several interesting American and Italian choices.</p>
