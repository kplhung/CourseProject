        <p>MENTION a Yosemite expedition to most fans of the park and you will be directed to the standard glorious sites: El Capitan, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls. You may also be encouraged to stay at the Ahwahnee Hotel, whose soaring dining room, Native American murals and location in the heart of Yosemite Valley have long made it the park's most luxurious lodging.</p>
        <p>But I'd heard magical stories about the grove of sequoia trees around 30 miles south of the Yosemite Valley. And when my boyfriend, Scott -- who puts up a good front as a  hard-bitten New Yorker -- confessed  to being a tree-lover, we decided to structure our trip last fall so that we could best appreciate those celebrated giants. That is how we came to stay at the Wawona Hotel, 10 miles or so from the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias and a delightful alternative to the Ahwahnee, even for those not seduced by the spell of the sequoias.</p>
        <p>We arrived in the late afternoon to the sight of deer grazing on the grass in the slanting sunlight while a few guests relaxed on the porch. The sense of unqualified serenity was soothing after the three-hour drive from San Francisco. And it contrasted sharply with the buses of tourists, frantically taking pictures, whom we encountered later on the other side of the park.</p>
        <p>The Wawona is undoubtedly more low-key than the Ahwahnee. But it is not without its quirks. At the desk, we were told that we were lucky to have got a private bathroom. (About half of the 104 rooms use two blocks of communal men's and women's bathrooms, which can be a longer walk than one might care to take in the middle of the night.)</p>
        <p>What we had not secured, we discovered after reaching our room, was a telephone. The hotel's two pay phones seemed to accommodate the communications needs of most guests easily, but e-mail addicts take heed: an Internet connection is hard to come by at the Wawona (a desk attendant told us we could use a phone jack in the hotel office for 10 minutes after 9 p.m.).</p>
        <p>Happily abandoning our laptops, we took a quick tour of the grounds.  The Wawona's location is no accident. The hotel started as a cabin built by Galen Clark, one of the first white men to explore the Mariposa Grove. A pioneer of the homesteading movement in the Sierra whom Teddy Roosevelt christened ''Guardian of Yosemite,'' Clark began giving tours of the trees, and in 1876 built Clark Cottage to attract more visitors.</p>
        <p>The restored Victorian-style lodge that now serves as the main building was constructed in 1879. By 1918 the three others on the Wawona grounds had been added. The architecture of each is slightly different, but all are wood and painted white with green trim. Each has a shaded veranda that overlooks wide rolling lawns. A nine-hole golf course, a modest-size pool and a tennis court add to the slightly odd impression that you have stumbled upon a country club in the middle of the wilderness. In the cold morning air, dashing across the dewy grass to breakfast in the main building, both Scott and I were reminded of summers at sleep-away camp. We half expected to be sent to the archery range for our first activity of the day.</p>
        <p>That afternoon, however, we wanted to catch a glimpse of the sequoias before the light faded. About four miles south of the hotel is the southern entrance to the park. Two miles past that is the Mariposa Grove. When the parking lot fills up, visitors are asked to park at the park entrance and take a free bus, but on each of the four visits we paid over the next two days we were able to drive in.</p>
        <p>We were humbled by the trees. Sequoias, we discovered, are not so much tall as they are massive. Sequoias are members of the redwood family but, unlike the redwoods, as they age they expand sideways rather than up, an effect that for me  makes them more impressive. Redwoods can grow considerably higher. Our trek around the lower portion of the grove ended with the Grizzly Giant, which, at 2,700 years old and with a base diameter of 30 feet, is one of the oldest living sequoias. It is a sight that bears many repeat visits.</p>
        <p>Back at the hotel we put our names on the waiting list for dinner. The dining room doesn't take reservations. The lobby was full of guests and good cheer, including a pianist and lots of comfortable couches. We were next in line for one of the backgammon sets when our table was called.</p>
        <p>The dining room is spacious, with large windows overlooking the front lawn. It does not serve California cuisine. A cheeseburger was included under ''light fare,'' for example, and variations on steak with side dishes of fettuccine Alfredo seemed to be the kitchen's forte. We savored a slice of pecan pie, then headed to bed.</p>
        <p>Our room was small, but the queen-size bed was luxuriously heaped with pretty spreads and quilts. We especially appreciated our modern bathroom with tub and shower, knowing our fellow guests were not all so blessed, and planned for an early start the next day.</p>
        <p>After a basic but filling breakfast of eggs, toast, hash browns and bacon in the dining room, which included a view of the daily flag-raising ritual, we set out for Yosemite Valley, a 40-minute drive, blithely passing the gas station a few hundred feet from the hotel. It wasn't until we reached the Ahwahnee for lunch, after stops at Granite Peak and Bridalveil Falls, that we learned there was no other gas option on our route.</p>
        <p>We enjoyed our hike up Yosemite Falls, but found the crowds everywhere in the Valley, even in September, to be oppressive. By late afternoon, we were ready to head south again. Making sure to coast on all downward inclines, we managed to make it to the gas station, and went to pay our respects to the trees before dinner.</p>
        <p>Back at the hotel, we almost wished we'd spent the afternoon lazing by the pool (affectionately referred to as ''the swimming tank'') because the guests there seemed so relaxed and happy. The favorite evening activity at the Wawona is watching the sunset with a drink from the porch, and we could see why. After seeing the sky turn pink, and taking another meal in the hotel dining room, we returned to the Mariposa Grove for some stargazing.</p>
        <p>In the morning, we explored the upper part of the grove, which ends past the Grove Museum at Wawona Point, a three-mile hike from the trailhead. The trail gets steeper in parts after the Grizzly Giant tree, but it is also considerably less crowded. In the lower grove, each tree is marked and there is a bit of a nature-trail feel to it. In the upper grove, we really had the sense of wandering through a forest.</p>
        <p>Far better apprised of our place in the universe than we had been before our stay, we bade goodbye to the Wawona and left the sequoias behind.</p>
