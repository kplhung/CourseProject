        <p>IN the last two years, there has been a flurry of conversions of rental buildings to co-ops or condominiums in New York City and the surrounding suburbs, according to the state attorney general's office.

        <p>IN the last two years, there has been a flurry of conversions of rental buildings to co-ops or condominiums in New York City and the surrounding suburbs, according to the state attorney general's office. The office said there had been nine such conversions in New York City alone since the beginning of 1999.</p>
        <p>While that is a far cry from the hundreds of conversions that took place each year in  the 1980's, real estate lawyers say that the reason for the new conversions -- and the reason there may be even more on the horizon -- is a combination of sky-high apartment prices and the fact that luxury decontrol appears to be making it easier for sponsors to sell the number of units necessary for a conversion to take effect.</p>
        <p>Here are some tips for tenants who find themselves part of a conversion.</p>
        <p>''The first, most important thing to remember is do not panic,'' said Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. ''The co-op and condominium conversion process is a long and sometimes frightening procedure. But if the conversion is a noneviction plan -- and almost all new conversions are -- the co-op and condominium conversion law protects you from being required to pay an unconscionable rent no matter what may happen to the rent laws.''</p>
        <p>What that means, Mr. Saft said, ''is that even if the rent laws cease to exist, a nonpurchasing tenant cannot be evicted if he is willing to pay a market-rate rent.''</p>
        <p>Under a noneviction plan, Mr. Saft said, nonpurchasing rent-regulated tenants continue to enjoy all the rights and benefits of their rent-regulated tenancies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saft said that with an eviction-plan conversion -- in which nonpurchasing tenants can be evicted when their current leases expire or a year after the conversion, whichever is later -- a sponsor needs to sell 51 percent of the units in a building before the conversion can be declared effective.</p>
        <p>Because of the high sale percentage requirement, however, the vast majority of conversions are done under a noneviction plan. With such a conversion, Mr. Saft said, the sponsor needs to sell 15 percent of the apartments in a building for the plan to be declared effective.</p>
        <p>Tenants in a noneviction plan conversion, Mr. Saft said, most likely have little to lose and much to gain. ''A conversion provides benefits to both purchasing and nonpurchasing tenants,'' Mr. Saft said, explaining that those who buy their units traditionally pay less than market value while those who do not buy end up living in a more efficiently managed and better maintained building.</p>
        <p>For residents contemplating purchasing, lawyers say, it pays to organize.</p>
        <p>Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that the value of the benefits that tenants realize from a conversion depends on the ability of the tenants to band together and negotiate the most favorable terms possible.</p>
        <p>''I know of no other area of law in which the client's participation counts so much in the ultimate success of the legal battle,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''And the most important thing the tenants must do is to secure the respect of the sponsor as a negotiating force.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinstein said that since a sponsor needs to sell at least 15 percent of the units, the sponsor generally needs the cooperation of the tenants. ''The tenants' greatest power is the power to say, 'We're not buying,' '' Mr. Weinstein said. ''So the first thing the tenants have to do is organize.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinstein said that under current law, a sponsor is permitted to keep vacant -- or ''warehouse'' -- up to 10 percent of the units in the building. And since vacant apartments can usually be sold easily, that means that a sponsor with the maximum number of vacant units has to persuade tenants in only 5 percent of the apartments to agree to buy.</p>
        <p>In recent years, what is called luxury decontrol seems to have given sponsors the ability to sell 15 percent of the apartments more easily than before. Mr. Weinstein said that under the luxury-decontrol provision of the Rent Stabilization Law, if an existing tenant vacates an apartment, and the landlord makes enough capital improvements to increase the rent to more than $2,000 a month, the apartment becomes deregulated. He said that since the law allows a landlord to increase the monthly rent permanently by 1/40th of the amount of the capital improvement, and permits a vacancy-allowance increase of as much as 20 percent, getting the rent above $2,000 can be accomplished fairly easily.</p>
        <p>In such a case, he said, a landlord who is contemplating a conversion can rent the apartment to a new tenant with a short-term lease with no right to renew. Then, Mr. Weinstein said, once the conversion plan has been submitted for the attorney general's office for review, the landlord can decline to renew the lease.</p>
        <p>But when the landlord needs the tenants' help, ''organization among the tenants is so important,'' Mr. Weinstein said. He said that if the tenants can convince the landlord that he is not going to get any buyers in the building without the tenant organization's cooperation, the tenants will be in a position to negotiate some extremely important aspects of the conversion plan.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Weinstein said, while the law requires the sponsor to provide an engineering report addressing the structural and mechanical condition of the building, a well-organized tenant's group will hire its own engineer.</p>
        <p>''You've got to know what makes the building tick,'' Mr. Weinstein said, adding that deficiencies and problems in the building that are disclosed by the tenants' engineering report can be used as a bargaining tool in negotiating, for example, the amount that the sponsor will place in a reserve fund for future repairs and maintenance.</p>
        <p>''The key thing to remember is that almost everything is negotiable,'' Mr. Weinstein said, explaining that among the negotiable items in a co-op or condominium conversion are the terms of the mortgage on the building (a mortgage often held by the sponsor), the scope of repairs and improvements that are to be made at the sponsor's expense before the conversion, the interest rates on individual share loans offered by the sponsor to tenants, and the insider price being asked for units bought by the tenants.</p>
        <p>''I always shoot for a fraction of market value,'' he said, adding that while in the past an acceptable insider price for tenants would be 50 percent of market value, in the current market with a building in which the sponsor clearly controls 15 percent of the units, negotiators might advise tenants that 75 percent might be acceptable.</p>
        <p>Errol Brett, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that for tenants wondering whether their building is a candidate for conversion, there are telltale signs. ''You'll start to notice vacancies and you'll probably see some improvements,'' Mr. Brett said, explaining that landlords contemplating a conversion will warehouse apartments that become vacant -- at least up to the 10 percent limit allowed by law. In addition, he said, some landlords will start to spruce up the building in the hope of enticing tenants to buy.</p>
        <p>''In most buildings being converted, there are basically two types of people,'' Mr. Brett said. ''Those who say, 'This is great,' and those who say, 'This is terrible.' And I've found that the hardest thing about representing tenants in a conversion is just persuading everybody to relax and be patient. If you think the deal is great, you buy. If you think the deal is terrible, you don't.''</p>
