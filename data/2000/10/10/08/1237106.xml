        <p>Mutual funds are sold, not bought, the saying goes. That sales-driven philosophy is behind the growing number of companies using outside managers to run their funds.</p>
        <p>''It's a competitive move to differentiate their product offerings,'' said Sara Mason Ader, who edits The Cerulli Edge, a research newsletter published by Cerulli Associates, financial services consultants based in Boston. ''By using multiple managers, fund companies can combine brand-name recognition and investment expertise in one package.''</p>
        <p>One of every nine mutual funds uses outside managers, representing about 7 percent of the industry's total assets under management, according to Cerulli. Such funds accounted for 10 percent of the net sales of the fund industry in 1999.</p>
        <p>The use of outside managers has a variety of forms. Some fund companies, including the Vanguard Group, divide a single fund portfolio among several outside managers. The concept, started in the mid-70's, is becoming increasingly popular as performance and brand names become key differentiators in a crowded fund marketplace.</p>
        <p>Some funds that follow specific investment styles -- like buying large-cap growth or small-cap value stocks -- use outside managers to run portions of the portfolios. SunAmerica Asset Management's Style Select Series comprises 11 funds, each of which is run by two or three outside managers.</p>
        <p>Outside managers are often brought in to run portions of ''life cycle'' funds, which combine aggressive and conservative investments according to the investor's stage of life. And multimanager variable annuities that include funds from at least one outside manager have been dominating the sales of annuities for several years.</p>
        <p>One of the newest twists in using multimanagers is a ''hedge fund of funds,'' a single fund made up of two or more hedge funds. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds do not have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, so accurate data is not available, but Cerulli estimates that about 500 hedge funds of funds are on the market.</p>
        <p>The advantage of such funds is clear: investment minimums as low as $5,000, compared with typical hedge fund minimums of $500,000 or more.</p>
        <p>Over the long term, multimanager investing is likely to become more widespread, Ms. Ader said, ''given a clear investor proclivity for best-of-breed products and styling.''</p>
