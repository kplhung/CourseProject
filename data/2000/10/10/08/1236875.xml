        <p>From 1980 to 1993 Frank Rich was the chief theater critic for The New York Times. But his relationship with the theater began many years before.

        <p>It was freezing in New York in December 1963, and our hotel, the Astor, a fraying yet ornate Winter Palace, was stuffy with heat. The hotel took up an entire block, housed its own movie theater and was adjacent to the thickest clusters of Broadway shows. My stepfather, Joel, had taken Mom, his own children and my sister, Polly, and me from Washington to New York for an entire week of theater. Incredibly, we were in a room overlooking Shubert Alley itself. Right outside our window were the letters B-O-O-T-H, displayed in small white lights on black scaffolding on that theater's roof. When we looked down, we could see the New York crowds rushing through the alley, surely to get to the box offices nearby.</p>
        <p>I wanted to join them, and the day after we arrived, I asked Mom if I could go to a ''special holiday matinee'' of a show on my own. I was 14 now, and already had my choice picked out: ''Jennie.'' Except for its star, it had received dismissive reviews and was closing at week's end, having run just two months, but I longed to see Mary Martin onstage. I'd seen her only on television, where every year they rebroadcast her old ''Peter Pan.''</p>
        <p>Mom and Joel didn't object -- as long as I was back in time for dinner and the next play -- so I went to the Majestic Theater, bought the cheapest seat I could and climbed the stairs to the nearly deserted balcony. Soon the lights dimmed and the music started, but the overture was muted compared with the others</p>
        <p>I'd heard. To my amazement, the audience scattered around me didn't listen to the orchestra with intense anticipation but just kept on talking as if there were no overture at all. When the curtain rose, the experience was also new. I was conscious of how flat the dialogue sounded, as if it were reaching me through an echo chamber, and of how lugubriously the actors moved around onstage.</p>
        <p>In my restlessness, I tried to picture that night a month before, the day after President Kennedy had been assassinated. I had read in Variety that Mary Martin had spoken before the performance, telling the audience, ''I cannot ask you to forget, but perhaps we can help each other for the next few hours.'' I could picture her saying it in a spotlight at the edge of the stage in her best Peter Pan voice, just as if she were asking everyone watching her to clap as hard as they could to bring Tinker Bell back to life. Today, there was no urgency in Mary Martin's performance, and she seemed to turn her singing on and off like a faucet. The applause at the end of her songs petered out quickly every time, and the show lumbered on.</p>
        <p>''Jennie'' was only about 45 minutes old when I was wishing I had chosen another show. Five blocks away, at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, was ''She Loves Me,'' which starred an actress I worshiped, Barbara Cook, whom I had first seen at the Majestic as Marian the librarian in ''The Music Man.'' She sang in a voice that made you feel as if she cared about whomever she was singing to more than she cared about anyone else in the world. She was the kind of woman -- blond and stacked, too -- whom I planned to fall in love with someday.</p>
        <p>''She Loves Me'' had a 3 o'clock curtain -- an hour later than ''Jennie'' -- and I decided after intense internal debate to spend the extra money to see it. It had never occurred to me before to leave a show early, and as I left the Majestic, I felt guilty. At home in Washington I always thought of shows as deserting me, when they left the National Theater for Broadway after their brief try-out runs. Now I was the one who was deserting ''Jennie.'' As I walked quietly down the balcony stairs, I stopped at the back of the theater -- at the railing where there would have been standees if the performance had been S.R.O. I watched a few minutes more, but from this perspective as well the show still seemed to be sealed off in its own ether on the other side of the footlights.</p>
        <p>I knew that this was the same theater where, the year I was born, Mary Martin had starred in ''South Pacific,'' a musical Mom had wanted so much to see and never had. In the warm Washington spring of 1949, the music of ''South Pacific'' was like a hurricane, she told me, that swept down from New York, remaking everything in its path, including Mom, who was then only weeks from giving birth to me. ''It was impossible to get a ticket,'' Mom said, her frequent explanation of why she and Dad hadn't gone to the theater more often back when they were still together. Now anyone could buy a ticket at the Majestic. It seemed heartless to watch Mary Martin on the same stage, acting before an audience that greeted her with polite indifference, as if she'd never had her triumph 14 years earlier. The whole vast theater seemed to sigh in a collective yawn.</p>
        <p>But once on the street I put ''Jennie'' out of my mind and ran full speed to ''She Loves Me,'' arriving just in time to get a $3 balcony seat as the show was starting. From that moment on, the week passed too quickly, with each high point spilling into the next -- from the real rain that doused the stage at the end of ''110 in the Shade'' to the nasty wrestling match between a big tomboy played by Colleen Dewhurst and a dwarf played by Michael Dunn in ''The Ballad of the Sad Cafe.'' I was so keyed up that in between shows I could do little but constantly reshuffle my Playbills and ticket stubs into stacks of varying significance.</p>
        <p>Late on our final afternoon, Mom and Joel at last heeded my persistent claims that I was entitled to special privileges befitting the eldest child. Since I'd proved that I could ''handle my independence'' in New York, they decided that while they and the rest of the kids ate at the hotel with a relative of Mom's from Brooklyn, I could go my own way, dine alone and meet them at the theater just before 8:30. Joel sent me to Frankie and Johnny's, a steakhouse on 45th Street, on the same block as the Morosco, where we were seeing ''The Private Ear and the Public Eye.''</p>
        <p>Mom gave me a $10 bill, more than enough for me to have a steak and something to drink, and to leave a tip. In a way, I was as pleased about having my own dinner as I was about seeing the show that would follow. If I didn't think about it too hard, I could imagine that I actually lived in New York and wasn't just a visitor there.</p>
        <p>At 7, with the crisp bill tucked into the wallet I'd been given for my bar mitzvah, I eagerly headed toward the restaurant. But I took the long way there, stopping first at a newsstand at another hotel, the Manhattan, to spend a quarter of my own money on the latest Variety. It was a luxury, since the same issue would be waiting for me back home, but I didn't care.</p>
        <p>As I paid, the newsstand man gave me a quizzical look, seemingly puzzled that a kid would read Variety. ''Do you know Eddie Hodges?'' he asked. I told the newsstand man no, I hadn't ever met Eddie Hodges, but by my eager response made it clear that I was in the know -- I knew that Eddie Hodges was the famous child actor whose song ''Gary, Indiana'' from ''The Music Man'' I had mimicked countless times to the accompaniment of the original cast album, back in the days when Mom was single and I fantasized that I might by some magic become him. What a city New York was! Even the newsstand men seemed to care about the theater as much as I did.</p>
        <p>At Frankie and Johnny's -- the restaurant used to be a speakeasy, Mom had told me -- I climbed the stairs to the second-floor entrance. I mentioned Joel's name, as he'd said to do, and the waiter showed me to a table. My feet didn't reach the floor when I sat down, but could he see that? He asked if I wanted the children's menu. I paused, then found the courage to say no, and he brought me a huge slab of New York restaurant cardboard that had to be unfolded like a box to be read. There was nothing like it in Washington, where the menus were more often than not printed on the paper place mat.</p>
        <p>Within minutes -- or maybe it was a half-hour; I was too enthralled with the professional bustle of the waiters, with my glittering fellow diners all around, with the Broadway posters on the wall -- they brought my sirloin steak and French fries. I painstakingly devoured my newspaper, the food and a glass of milk, knowing I had ample time to make it to the Morosco Theater. When there was no choice but to pay and leave, I asked the waiter for the check, studied it carefully, then left a meticulously computed tip (15 percent of the total before they add the tax, Joel had instructed) and walked down the stairs back to 45th Street and up the block to the theater, where Joel was waiting in the lobby to take me inside to our seats.</p>
        <p>At intermission, I told Joel what I had read in Variety. It seemed that not just ''Jennie'' but half the plays in New York were closing that night, fleeing town just as my family and the rest of the tourists would be, as if Christmas on Broadway were a charade put on exclusively for our benefit. What happens when a play closes? I asked. To which Joel replied, catching Mom's eye as he did so, ''Why don't you find out?''</p>
        <p>As long as I promised to be back in my room no later than midnight, I was free to explore Times Square, to see what happened at the theaters where the shows were closing and to scoop up any discarded Playbills that I had as yet failed to secure over the week.</p>
        <p>I waved a joyous goodbye as soon as we were among the crowds spilling out of every Broadway house. On each block I found long vans parked in front of the theaters with men lounging about them. They reminded me of the moving truck that had come for our furniture when Mom, Polly and I moved from Somerset to Rosemary Hills when Mom and Dad split up back when I was in elementary school.</p>
        <p>The sets of the closing plays were about to be ''struck,'' then loaded into the trucks and taken away. Most of the action was on 45th Street. Half the shows on the block were closing, including a comedy called ''Love and Kisses'' at the theater I thought of as Moss Hart's Music Box and, at the Royale, a French play called ''The Rehearsal.'' Outside the Royale, the photographs of ''The Rehearsal'' were still brightly lit in their glass cases: actors in period costumes and powdered wigs, like those in ''The School for Scandal,'' bowing and kissing in sumptuous rooms. The doors to the theater were still open, the empty auditorium bathed in an amber half-light, and I could peer in from the deserted lobby and see that stagehands were dismantling the walls of one of the rooms depicted in the photos out front. The set was coming apart easily, piece by piece; the furniture was being packed into boxes just like our moving boxes, and so were the costumes, carefully placed on hangers, the way Mom's clothes had been when the trucks came to move our things.</p>
        <p>Then the backdrop hanging across the rear of the stage came down -- that was the sky.</p>
        <p>Only a few hours earlier, I thought, there had been people talking and laughing and crying on this stage as if their lives would never end. Now there was nothing but what looked like a giant night light. It stood at the center of the empty stage: a tall black pole with a single light bulb at its top, a solitary lamp casting stark shadows everywhere. What was its point? I wondered. Instead of filling the stage with color and excite-ment like regular stage lights, it accentuated the drab desolation of the empty house. I knew nothing about this play, this ''Rehearsal,'' and yet</p>
        <p>I ached for it in some strange way -- for its stilled heart, for the naked light that stood where the actors once had. Years later I would learn that this light was called a ghost light, and that was surely the right name for it. There were ghosts everywhere.</p>
        <p>Where were those actors from ''The Rehearsal'' now? They didn't stay around to watch what happened to the house they were deserting any more than Mom and Dad had the home our family had abandoned. And yet the house seemed haunted by the company of actors that had dispersed and by all the audiences who had seen the play during its run.</p>
        <p>Watching the sets being struck was nonetheless an antidote to the gloom of a show's closing. The exposure and dismantling of the play's illusion seemed every bit as theatrical to me as the creation of that illusion. Plays came and went, but the theater stayed. Even an empty playhouse had drama, intense and perhaps momentous.</p>
        <p>Only at one closing, a block away, could I not see the dismantling of the scenery; the stage door of ''Jennie'' wasn't visible, seemingly hidden by a long passageway that led to the sidewalk. As I arrived at the Majestic, it was perilously close to midnight. The vans were pulling away, their engines heaving and belching with exhaust. The neighborhood that I had never imagined as anything other than hectic was starting to look deserted.</p>
        <p>A lone young man was still standing in front of the darkened Majestic. He clutched a stack of Playbills even larger than my own. His eyes were large and liquid, and he seemed a breed of person apart, residing completely in this world that I could visit only as a tourist.</p>
        <p>I stopped a few feet from him on the sidewalk, eager to see if anything was going on; my curfew was approaching, and I had to be fast. Perhaps recognizing a somewhat kindred spirit -- or simply protecting his own, carefully staked-out turf -- the man said hello and struck up a conversation, explaining that he loved ''Jennie'' and was waiting to get Mary Martin's autograph. There was a hunger I recognized in this man, as if he were starving for company. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I hadn't liked ''Jennie'' and didn't think Mary Martin was going to turn up at this hour, now that the theater's marquee had dimmed.</p>
        <p>The giant marquee across the street still burned with incongruous intensity. It was the St. James Theater, which had been home to ''Do Re Mi'' and then ''Mr. President'' and now a play called ''Luther.'' The young man pointed at it and informed me in a whisper, as if he were imparting the darkest secret, that the producer David Merrick was about to move ''Luther'' to another theater so that he could bring his new production, a musical, to the St. James the next month.</p>
        <p>To the man's surprise, I told him that I had already seen that musical. Just before I came to New York, ''Hello, Dolly!'' had begun its tryout in my hometown.</p>
        <p>''Hello, Dolly!'' had been the most unusual night I had ever had in a theater in Washington. In a scene in its second act, when the title character walked into an elegant restaurant in New York, the waiters, all wearing crisp white shirts and black pants like the waiters at the Broadway restaurants I'd been to, sang and danced with a speed I'd never before experienced. At one point they literally leapt over the orchestra pit, high up into the air, landing on a slender curved ramp that had been built right into the audience. As the dancers touched down, the ramp lit up with little light bulbs along its borders like those on an airport runway. The set behind them blinked with lights, too: a crimson restaurant with a towering staircase, as tall as the proscenium, that Dolly, wearing a crimson dress to match, had just descended. It didn't matter what the song was -- it just repeated the show's title over and over -- because the Washington audience had been in pandemonium. When the actress playing Dolly, Carol Channing, a woman with the highest blonde hair I'd ever seen, appeared on the ramp with the waiters who were serenading her and then joined their dance as well, people started standing up individually and in groups all over the theater and waving at her, as if they knew her. They didn't, I realized -- they just wanted to. The eruption looked like the old TV pictures of J.F.K. being deluged by crowds; now that he was dead, Washington had found someone else to go crazy about. ''Hello, Dolly!'' was like a buzzing alarm clock, waking up the solemn town and bringing it back to life.</p>
        <p>I looked at the young man. He was a total stranger, but I couldn't stop myself from venturing an opinion. Buy a ticket to ''Hello, Dolly!'' in</p>
        <p>advance, I told him. ''It's going to be a hit,'' I said, startling myself with my outspokenness.</p>
        <p>I couldn't tell if he believed me or not when he said that he just might send in a mail order. Maybe he'd read the bad Variety review of the tryout and thought I was a fool. All but swallowed up by the shadowy theater behind him, he was still waiting for Mary Martin as I said good night and turned to hurry back to the hotel.</p>
        <p>I wondered if he was as lonely as I often was. If so, I felt sorry for him, because I didn't feel lonely that night, not at all. Though I was soon returning to Washington, I felt indecently happy. Broadway seemed a place where no matter what happened in the rest of the world, a closing would always be followed by an opening, an empty house would always become full again.</p>
        <p>As a chill wind whipped me up 45th Street to the Astor, I felt terribly grown-up, as if I were being propelled into the future by the great and mysterious promise of the incipient new year.</p>
