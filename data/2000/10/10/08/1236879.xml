        <p>As a native New Yorker, I have often thought I would like to have been able to arrive in this city as a young adult and experience it, unfettered by a lifetime of memories. I know that a first-time experience in New York can be exhilarating as well as terrifying. I just wish that I could, even for a day, see it from that vantage point.</p>
