        <p>As small and bald as many of his fans, Garo Yepremian scored 1,074 points during his 15-year National Football League career. He was not the first former soccer player with enough leg to place-kick, but his size and accent made the Armenian Cypriot a butt of nervous jokes. He was not a real football player, said some of the big boys on his team. And it was true that when it came to size -- Garo was 5 feet 7 inches tall -- he might as well have been a girl. The real players knew what they were really worried about -- girls.</p>
        <p>The football those foreign-born soccer players kicked into the air nearly 40 years ago has not yet reached the ground. It hovered last week, like a blimp, above a federal court in Greensboro, N.C., where Heather Sue Mercer, 5 feet 7 inches tall, is suing Duke University for denying her an opportunity to be a place-kicker on its football team.</p>
        <p>Mercer's contention is that she was discriminated against solely because she is female, a federal violation. Duke responds that she was cut from the team because she was not good enough.</p>
        <p>Although the case will be decided by a jury, probably this week, on the basis of particulars, the larger issues are probably more interesting. If there are enough successful female kickers in Division I -- and the growth of women's soccer will create the talent pool -- it will be very hard to block the female wide receiver, tight end, gasp, quarterback and linebacker. It won't be footboy anymore. Is that necessarily progress? Beats me.</p>
        <p>The Mercer story began in 1992. A 16-year-old soccer player at Yorktown High School, in Westchester County, N.Y., she watched the school's place-kicker and thought, she said later, ''Man, that sure looks like fun.'' She told the athletic director, who took her to the football coach, Ron Santavicca, who gave her a chance. She kicked 20 consecutive field goals, from as far as 40 yards. Coach Santavicca suggested she go to kicking camp that summer, then try out for his team.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 1993, her senior year, Mercer was on the team. In the first game, a 26-0 victory, she kicked a field goal and 3 extra points. Her leg held up that season as Yorktown won a state title. She made third team all-state. Her attitude was traditional jock. She dismissed the attention she was getting and often insisted teammates be included in her photo ops. They liked her. So did the cheerleaders. She told Kate Stone Lombardi, in a story for The Times's Westchester weekly section: ''I don't even think about it like I'm a girl football player. I just think of myself as a kicker.'' Santavicca said she had ''a real football player mentality'' but he wouldn't let her kick off, which she said ''makes me mad.''</p>
        <p>She was willing to risk being hurt, she said: ''I think it would be really cool to get hit. You can't say you've really played football until you get hit.''</p>
        <p>A year later, a freshman at Duke, she presented herself to Coach Fred Goldsmith, who gave her a tryout. Or did he? The spin on these particulars is what the current court case is about.</p>
        <p>In the offense that Burton Craige of Raleigh is fielding, Mercer was not given a fair shake; ultimately, she wasn't allowed to kick for Duke because she was female. In the defense presented by the powerhouse Washington firm of Fulbright &amp; Jaworski, Mercer was just not good enough to kick in Duke's league even though Mercer won the 1995 spring intrasquad game with a last-minute field goal. Then, typically, she refused television interview requests, including Jay Leno's.</p>
        <p>Among the questions the jury will ponder are these: Why did Coach Goldsmith let her kick for him, declare her a member of the team, put her picture in the media guide, then not allow her to suit up, go to preseason camp or practice with her teammates? The answers should lead to a decision that will probably show that Mercer's rights under Title IX were violated. If quotes attributed to Goldsmith -- that Mercer should go out for beauty pageants instead of the team and that Duke recruiting would be adversely affected by her presence -- are true, a pattern of discrimination will be established.</p>
        <p>Mercer, an economics major who fenced for Duke, did not institute her suit until her senior year, when she had given up hopes of playing. She graduated in 1998 and works for Charles Schwab &amp; Company in New York. Although no dollar amount was mentioned, she is suing for damages. She says she suffered from depression, the denial of educational benefits and ''the deprivation of opportunities to participate in the future in amateur or professional athletics.''</p>
        <p>It's the word ''professional'' that should catch our attention.</p>
        <p>The most powerful male bastion in American sport, and perhaps the last, is pro football. It is not hard to fantasize a woman in a major league infield, in a National Hockey League goal, even as a point guard once David Stern decides to merge the National Basketball Association and the Women's N.B.A. But, Lombardi help us, never in a Super Bowl where the manhood of all those Bud lightheads on the other side of the TV set could be dented.</p>
        <p>Extreme football may be insurance against a Heather Sue Mercer winning her case and opening the traditional field to Garo's spiritual daughters.</p>
        <p>I haven't even thought about any of this seriously in 30 years, since a 27-year-old, 122-pound schoolteacher, Pat Palinkas, became, it was thought, the first woman to play in a pro football game. The minor league Orlando Panthers put her in to hold the ball for her husband, the place-kicker. The snap from center was off target and she bobbled the ball. Bridgeport Jets linebacker Wally Florence, a 27-year-old, 240-pound youth counselor who had been cut by the Jets and Giants, crashed through and knocked her flat.</p>
        <p>''I tried to break her neck,'' he told me later, for ''making folly of a man's game. I wanted to smash her back to the kitchen.''</p>
        <p>Have our attitudes changed, are we subtler now, is Mercer messing with manhood, why can't she go be a boxer, if she still wants to get hit, it's the current rage? Does any of this pique you enough to vent to the lipsite@aol.com? Lawyer Craige tells me that Mercer would use her winnings to establish a college scholarship for female place-kickers.</p>
