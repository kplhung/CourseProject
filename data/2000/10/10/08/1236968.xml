        <p>FOR years, residents of the Islip Town section of Hauppauge have been paying for the privilege of using libraries in other towns. Then, in an election last week, they were asked to vote on whether they wanted a library of their own.</p>
        <p>The answer, overwhelmingly, was yes.</p>
        <p>By a tally of 1,244 to 432, voters endorsed a plan that would close a hole in the patchwork system of libraries that has been developed over the years by individual communities.  In Hauppauge, about half of the residents live in the Town of Smithtown, which operates its own municipal library. The rest are in Islip Town, which does not have a library.</p>
        <p>''If Hauppauge had a library that was run by its school district -- meaning it collected the taxes for the library -- everyone in Hauppauge would have had a library,'' said Stephen H. Bard, a retired lawyer in Hauppauge who was on the committee that organized the vote.</p>
        <p>The residents in the Smithtown section of Hauppauge pay for their library in their town taxes. Until last year, those in the rest of the Hauppauge went to one of four neighboring libraries -- Commack, Smithtown, Central Islip and Brentwood -- and bought annual library privileges. Last year, it cost each family about $280, which was about what other Suffolk taxpayers paid for their libraries through their taxes.</p>
        <p>But effective in January, the state Board of Regents decided that it would begin enforcing a decades-old law that barred public libraries from charging fees to give library cards to individuals and families. But before doing that, the board said it would give unserved communities a year to decide for themselves how best to obtain library privileges -- including contracting with a neighboring system to provide service for the whole community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bard said the committee had decided to ask Islip Town voters to create their own library district because contracting with a neighboring library for library privileges would have cost $772,500. Instead, on Tuesday voters approved the creation of their own library district for a few thousand dollars more -- $800,000 for its first year of operation. They also elected a five-member board of trustees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bard said his community's industrial tax base would pick up two-thirds the cost of the library district. As a result, homeowners will pay $20.80 per $10,000 of assessed valuation, about $104 for the typical homeowner.</p>
        <p>The decision went another way in Elwood, where residents voted on Sept. 26 to buy services from six surrounding library districts, supporting a contract similar to one that expired in June.</p>
        <p>Julie M. Badlato, president of the P.T.A. at the Harley Avenue Elementary School in Elwood who helped put the question on the ballot last month, said many people had reservations about the capital expenditure involved in buying land and building their own library. She said that unlike Hauppauge, which has a large industrial base, Elwood is a virtually all-residential community.</p>
        <p>Jerry Nichols, director of the Suffolk Cooperative Library System, said Elwood was one of eight communities in Suffolk that contract for service from neighboring libraries. The others are Miller Place, Mount Sinai, South Manor, East Quogue, East Moriches, Eastport and Remsenburg-Speonk.</p>
        <p>And within the last two years, he said, three communities that had been without library services have now obtained them. Fire Island has developed a relationship with the libraries of Bay Shore-Brightwaters and Islip to provide service to year-round residents, and Springs and Wainscott merged with the East Hampton Public Library.</p>
        <p>The director of the Nassau Library System, Jacquelyn E. Thresher, said free library cards were given to the 45,000 residents of Nassau's 18 unincorporated areas without library service because they did not have the ability to tax themselves. In Suffolk, she said, they do.</p>
        <p>She said efforts were under way to give each area the ability to tax itself. Just last month, Ms. Thresher said, Governor Pataki signed legislation creating the Gold Coast Library District for residents in the North Shore School District, including Glenwood Landing and Glen Head but excluding Sea Cliff. The legislation, introduced by Assemblyman David Sidikman, Democrat of Plainview, and State Senator Carl Marcellino, Republican of Oyster Bay, enables the residents to tax themselves.</p>
        <p>''They have to decide what to do with the tax,'' said Ms. Thresher. ''They can contract with neighboring library districts, build their own library or contract as an interim measure and build later.''</p>
        <p>Just two weeks ago, residents of the Village of North Hills, which includes parts of Great Neck and Manhasset, voted to join the Shelter Rock library district, Ms. Thresher said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thresher said state residents could obtain free library cards for use at state-supported central libraries, though these libraries had the right to restrict library use. She said that more than 2,500 unserved people had applied for a state-mandated access card for use in the county's state-supported central libraries, those in East Meadow and Levittown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bard said that by next spring, the Islip Town library board hoped to have a ''high-quality library -- including computer services, adult and children's books and programs -- in rented space.''</p>
        <p>''We are aware of several possible sites, including several state-owned properties and a former school building,'' he said. ''We won't have everything a huge library has, but once we have our own library, we will have borrowing privileges at other libraries, which is very important for a start-up library.''</p>
        <p>Until then, the approximately 10,000 residents of the Islip section of Hauppauge will continue to have free use of the one partly state-financed library in Suffolk, Patchogue-Medford. Several hundred have already  used that library, but it is 26 miles away and does not permit non-residents to take out new videos and books. Mr. Bard said the four neighboring libraries had also granted limited access to their libraries this year.</p>
