        <p>If your idea of entertaining television is equal parts ''This Old House,'' ''Big Brother'' and ''Beat the Clock,'' and your idea of soft porn is Elle Decor, you are one of the viewers targeted by the new reality-based series ''Trading Spaces,'' which made its debut on the Learning Channel at the end of last month.</p>
        <p>Even on paper, the show's premise is compelling. Two sets of neighbors put on color-coded team shirts (in this case, red and yellow), swap keys and, with the help of a professional decorator and carpenter, are given 48 hours to make over one room in their neighbors' home on a budget of $1,000. Both job sites are carefully cloaked in secrecy; if, say, a production assistant gets splashed with paint from one site, she isn't permitted to approach the other home until the telltale mark is scrubbed off. Such measures preserve the surprise payoff of the ''reveal'' at show's end, which dramatically answers the question: will the finished rooms be met with outrage or tears of gratitude?</p>

        <p>If your idea of entertaining television is equal parts ''This Old House,'' ''Big Brother'' and ''Beat the Clock,'' and your idea of soft porn is Elle Decor, you are one of the viewers targeted by the new reality-based series ''Trading Spaces,'' which made its debut on the Learning Channel at the end of last month.</p>
        <p>Even on paper, the show's premise is compelling. Two sets of neighbors put on color-coded team shirts (in this case, red and yellow), swap keys and, with the help of a professional decorator and carpenter, are given 48 hours to make over one room in their neighbors' home on a budget of $1,000. Both job sites are carefully cloaked in secrecy; if, say, a production assistant gets splashed with paint from one site, she isn't permitted to approach the other home until the telltale mark is scrubbed off. Such measures preserve the surprise payoff of the ''reveal'' at show's end, which dramatically answers the question: will the finished rooms be met with outrage or tears of gratitude?</p>
        <p>Of course, with the deadline inching ever closer, the entertainment value heats up as everyone on the set begins aerobically decorating and visibly sweating buckets. ''Trading Spaces'' manages to deliver a format that avoids the thudding dullness of much how-to TV. By showing it on Fridays from 4 to 5 p.m., TLC is banking on it to inject some much-needed vitality into the ''fringe time'' that perpetually confounds TV executives.</p>
        <p>So confident was TLC about ''Trading Spaces''' winning formula that, last May, the cable network farmed the project out to Ross Television, based in Knoxville, Tenn. It began taping in August and ran last month's episode without so much as testing a pilot in the United States. Under that leap of faith hung a safety net: the proven success of a prime-time BBC program called ''Changing Rooms,'' now in its sixth year.</p>
        <p>''It's truly a great show,'' says Stephen Schwartz, an executive producer at TLC who, inspired by an article in Metropolis magazine, viewed some tapes of the British show and quickly proposed an American version. ''I'm no genius,'' he adds, ''but you look at something like this and you go, 'Yeah!' It's entertaining as well as informative. It's fun to watch how these people interact with each other, sort of like a soap opera.''</p>
        <p>Just why are the Brits so bonkers over ''Changing Rooms''? Picture a half-hour hybrid of ''Absolutely Fabulous,'' ''Home Improvement'' and ''Family Feud.'' Throw in a rotating stable of scene-stealing designers (Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen is not above sanding floors and painting walls in skintight leather pants and frilly shirts with floppy cuffs) and a host, Carol Smillie, so beloved in Britain that she makes Katie Couric look downright unpopular.</p>
        <p>The result is a program as addictive as that other TV hit with British roots, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Since last year, ''Changing Rooms'' has entered some 13 million satellite- or digital-cable-rigged American homes on BBC America, and last month it increased its fan base when the station became available to those cable viewers in the New York City area who upgraded to Time Warner digital cable.</p>
        <p>In Britain, ''D.I.Y'' (do it yourself) home renovation has long been a favorite national pastime, but interior designers have often been regarded with suspicion. Now, can-do designers have acquired the cachet of rock stars -- and not solely because of Llewelyn-Bowen's Jimi Hendrix-meets-Lord Byron get-ups.</p>
        <p>''Changing Rooms' took something that few people were interested in -- decorating -- and made it into a national preoccupation,'' Llewelyn-Bowen says. ''I operated a high-profile design business for 12 years before 'Changing Rooms,' yet I can remember about seven years ago, people asking me what I did and then falling down laughing when I told them. Now, being an interior designer is at the top of most children's wish list, followed by garden designer and vet'' -- a reflection, he points out, of two other popular BBC shows, ''Ground Force'' and ''Vets in Practice.'' ''For a reserved nation like Britain, for people to be discussing interior design the next day like it was politics is a phenomenal advance,'' Llewelyn-Bowen continues. ''It's recapturing the 19th century, when taste was a part of life,'' he adds, sounding like that other trans-Atlantic superstar Oscar Wilde.</p>
        <p>The British show's American offshoot, ''Trading Spaces,'' is bigger, starting with the budget ($1,000 versus 500 pounds, or roughly $730) and the program length (an hour with commercials, 47 minutes without). That's plenty of time for the host, Alex McLeod, to sink her teeth into her ''instigator'' role, pointing the ''Alex-cam'' at her fellow cast mates, egging homeowners on and debriefing the designers about their feelings.</p>
        <p>So far, no leather-pants-clad personalities have emerged on the American version, but its cast is not without star quality. The show's Amy Wynn Pastor, a carpenter, gets down to work by rolling up her tank top until it's a bikini bra: she's a ''Tool Time'' girl with a bulging tool belt. Frank Bielec, a designer from Katy, Tex., is a bearlike, viewer-friendly cross between Christopher Lowell and Captain Kangaroo, who describes his design philosophy as Jack the Ripper meets Holly Hobbie. Bielec pushes primitive hand-painted murals (definitely an acquired taste), is partial to denim slipcovers and admits to being ''completely inept at anything mechanical.'' Marveling at a magnetic drill bit at the first taping, he wonders aloud, ''When did they invent this?'' ''In 1952,'' comes the priceless reply from his teammate Roger, a homeowner who recently refinished his own basement.</p>
        <p>At the polite end of the decorating spectrum is the flame-haired Laurie Smith of Jackson, Miss. With a preference for Scalamandre and Clarence House, Smith looks like an Edith Wharton heroine and spends like one, too. On ''Trading Spaces''' first taping, she admits that she ''splurged on fabric,'' exceeding her limit by $99.99 (Bielec crows about staying almost $100 under budget). By the second day of taping, the crew is gently ribbing Smith on her highfalutin pronunciation of ''pistachio'' (pis-TAH-sho) and rattling off a glossary of ''Laurie-isms,'' like ''charming'' and ''unfortunate.''</p>
        <p>At the first taping's ''reveal,'' both the red and yellow teams are pleased with their neighbors' handiwork. (This despite the crew's audible relish at hearing a yellow-team member express her profound dislike of stenciling even as, four doors down, the neighbors were applying hand-painted garlands to her walls.)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, back in Britain, ''Changing Rooms'' has had its share of fiascos, including one that necessitated bleeping the owners' horrified reaction at seeing their drawing room transformed into a red-and-zebra-striped ''whore's palace.''</p>
        <p>''Failures are good for the program because, let's be frank, there's an element of ambulance chasing in all of us,'' notes Llewelyn-Bowen, the party responsible for the ''whore's palace'' and many of ''Changing Rooms''' memorable interiors gone awry. ''We like to see things go wrong; it forces you to have a reaction.'' Since Brits consistently poke fun at Americans for their talk-show culture, it's ironic that this particular example of in-your-face entertainment started over there rather than here in the land of Ricki Lake, Jenny Jones et al.</p>
        <p>Whether ''Trading Spaces'' becomes a cult phenomenon on the order of its British counterpart hardly matters. Despite the differences between the American and British versions, any permutation of the show has an excellent prognosis on American TV. Makeovers have guaranteed mass appeal -- consider the success of televised before-and-after ugly-duckling dramas, whether brought to life on a talk show, an infomercial or the E! network's ''Fashion Emergency.'' But a makeover show that involves opening one's defended keep to strangers wielding glue guns, paint and cameras really hits home.</p>
        <p>''The instinct to decorate is part of the primal brain, the brain of patterns, habits and routines,'' says the Manhattan psychotherapist Dr. Laurie Nadel, the author of ''Sixth Sense'' (Paraview Press) and a former CBS News writer-producer. ''We arrange our spaces to give ourselves a sense of safety,'' she adds. ''The idea of going into somebody's territory and not only sitting in their favorite chair, but making major renovations ... You're messing around on some pretty volatile territory.''</p>
        <p>And potentially volatile situations make enormously watchable TV.</p>
