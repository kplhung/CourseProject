        <p>WHEN ''V.I.P.,'' the syndicated series starring Pamela Anderson, made its debut two years ago, it was without the imprimatur of Viewers for Quality Television.</p>
        <p>The concept alone seemed like a frontal assault on the audience's intelligence, even by ''Xena: Warrior Princess'' standards. In the opening credits, Ms. Anderson explains how her character, Vallery Irons, was working at a hot-dog stand when she accidentally saved a celebrity's life and was recruited to run a Los Angeles bodyguard agency. She's not really the boss, of course, just a figurehead.</p>
        <p>''V.I.P.'' goes into its third season this week. Foreign distribution rights have been sold in 80 countries. Major Hollywood players like Jay Leno and, well, Erik Estrada have made cameos. Lee Majors and Loni Anderson have also appeared, as Val's parents. Which tells you something right there: that the show is not just a blatant bimbo-fest, though it is that too. It's the smartest dumb show on television.</p>
        <p>Example: Val is arguing with her co-worker, Tasha, at the headquarters of Vallery Irons Protection. They wave samurai swords at each other until pressing bodyguard business persuades them to put down their weapons.</p>
        <p>''You're so lucky,'' Val admonishes Tasha. ''I could have de-headed you!''</p>
        <p>In the words of ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' there's a fine line between stupid and clever, and Ms. Anderson -- ex-Playmate, ''Baywatch'' bikini filler and amateur porn star -- walks it in five-inch Lucite heels.</p>
        <p>Her show is a reverse ''Charlie's Angels.'' Instead of a beautiful model-actress-whatever playing a brilliant private detective (or brain surgeon or nuclear physicist), you have the beautiful star playing a bimbo. Plus plenty of gratuitous violence and mayhem.</p>
        <p>''It's postmodern,'' said Morgan Gendel, one of the executive producers. The others are J. F. Lawton (''Under Siege''), who conceived the show, and Ms. Anderson herself, who has dropped the ''Lee'' from her surname, though she remains on good enough terms with her ex-husband, Tommy Lee, for him to have appeared in one episode last season.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lawton had wanted her to do an action series. But after the less than enthusiastic response to her first major film, the 1996 ''Barb Wire'' (sort of an unironic ''V.I.P.''), she knew better. ''My idea was to have a very campy 70's-ish action show with more modern action,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gendel, a television writer trained in the Stephen J. Cannell school of action-drama, eschews ''the C-word'' -- camp. ''We take it completely seriously,'' he said. ''Which is why I think it's so funny.''</p>
        <p>And Ms. Anderson? Does she mind playing a maximally dumbed-down version of herself? ''I think it's hard to play dumb if you're dumb,'' she said, preferring to describe Val as ''a little naive.''</p>
        <p>As blithely superficial as Alicia Silverstone in ''Clueless'' and as petulantly spoiled as Goldie Hawn in ''Private Benjamin,'' Ms. Anderson's Valle(r)y gal teeters through a world of mullet-haired ex-cons and swarthy international terrorists without getting so much as a spot on her pink hot pants. Hookers, by the way, wear less revealing get-ups. At first, there was an effort on the show to get Ms. Anderson into bathing suits as much as possible, until she informed the producers that her ''street clothes'' were much skimpier.</p>
        <p>There's a fine line between Pamela and Vallery. Both, for instance, came to Los Angeles from Canada and enjoy tattoos. One of Val's endearing qualities (though not necessarily one of Ms. Anderson's) is her spectacular gift for missing the point. When a V.I.P sidekick, Nikki Franco (Natalie Raitano), is asked to take over for her grandfather the mob boss, Val asks her, ''Why don't you go legit, like Michael Corleone in 'The Godfather'?'' But she is also capable of using her limited knowledge for goodness. When an international criminal calls and hangs up without leaving his number, it's Val who thinks to dial *69.</p>
        <p>As in the female-centric ''Xena,'' the male muscle on ''V.I.P.'' is secondary. Quick Williams (Shaun Baker) and Johnny Lo (Dustin Nguyen) exist to do Val's bidding, kickboxing her out of trouble with as little dialogue as possible. The central relationship is between Val and Tasha (Molly Culver), an all-business former K.G.B. agent. She's the ''smart one'' who conveniently happens to look great in a bikini. So great that many viewers might have difficulty taking their eyes off her -- if Ms. Anderson weren't also in the frame.</p>
        <p>The show loves to riff on -- or rip off -- movies. In the ''Thelma and Louise'' road-trip episode, Val and Tasha cat-fight and bond with the primal feminine violence of a Russ Meyer movie (e.g., ''Supervixens'').</p>
        <p>''You envy my ability to have a good time in any situation,'' Val gloats. Stranded in the desert, they huddle by a campfire. Encouraging Tasha's good-time side, Val attempts to warm up her frosty colleague with philosophy: ''Life is a balancing act: hot and cold, earth and water, yin and . . . that other thing,'' she says, before curling up behind Tasha as they bed down for the night. And they haven't even made it to the lesbian roadhouse yet.</p>
        <p>Asex kitten for all seasons (and genders), Ms. Anderson also turns out to be a natural physical comedian. This might not come as a surprise to anyone who caught the widely bootlegged X-rated video of her and Mr. Lee cavorting on their honeymoon. Her cartoon of a body is matched by gravity-defying lip curls, forever squinting and widening eyes and rapid-fire bim-speak. ''We-like-don't-have-any-money-or-anything-butI'm-totally-good-for-an-i.o.u.,'' she blurts at a gang of dumbstruck neo-Nazis she has mistaken for garage mechanics.</p>
        <p>In this season's first episode, a ''Survivor'' parody, Val repairs a tent with one of her barrettes, a tip she picked up from watching Ginger on ''Gilligan's Island.'' Dumb blonde indeed.</p>
        <p>''TV is all hair, makeup and wardrobe,'' Ms. Anderson observed, explaining her approach to her craft. ''I don't really notice everything else.''</p>
        <p>Out of the mouths of babes.</p>
