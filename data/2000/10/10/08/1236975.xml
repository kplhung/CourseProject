        <p>NOOKS and crannies, hidden staircases, secret hideaways -- just your typical 1930's Tudor-style suburban architecture.</p>
        <p>Hartford Hall, however, an official national landmark on the campus of Westchester Community College in Valhalla, is not just any building.</p>
        <p>Built in 1932 near the site of a Revolutionary War battle, on land that was once used to breed horses, the mansion was the home of John A. Hartford, heir to the A.&amp;P. supermarket empire, and his wife, Pauline. They named the property Buena Vista Farm.</p>
        <p>The college is offering free tours of the 20-room building every 15 minutes from 10 a.m. to noon next Saturday and on Oct. 21 and 28. Visitors will see the screening room, the sunken living room with its attached open-air but partially roofed veranda and the secret passage connecting the study with the living room, among other features. (Don't mind the boxes, filing cabinets and copying machines -- the college uses the building for staff offices.)</p>
        <p>Guides will also talk about the site's colorful history, which includes some somber stories. For instance, when Hessian and British troops marched across the fields in 1780, they found a group of colonists, smallpox victims, who were buried alive in snow drifts on what is now the campus.</p>
        <p>The tours, underwritten by a $1,000 grant from the New York Council for the Humanities, will each culminate in a reception with refreshments served in the hall. Registration is required, and the number to call is (914) 785-6793.</p>
