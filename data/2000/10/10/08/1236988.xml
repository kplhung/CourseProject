        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your panel of playwrights who had been given seasons at the Signature Theater Company [''A Reunion of Playwrights Shaped in One Crucible,'' Sept. 24], Arthur Miller bemoans the lack of producers originating straight plays on Broadway. That is largely because 99 percent of the new plays written by established playwrights like Mr. Miller are never submitted to commercial producers. Their new plays, perhaps for good reasons, are immediately sent to not-for-profit theaters with little or no planning for the future. Playwrights might find that they could be better served both artistically and financially if their new plays were entrusted to a commercial producer from the beginning.</p>
