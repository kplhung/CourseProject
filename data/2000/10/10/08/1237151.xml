        <p>IN the summer of 1999, Dr. Camilo Martinez was treating the working poor of the San Fernando Valley in a clinic north of Los Angeles. A year later, he was sitting in a courtroom in Boston, monitoring the health of a very different subject: the shares of Amgen, the biotechnology company.</p>
        <p>That drastic change of venue offers a glimpse of the transformation of Dr. Martinez and two colleagues from doctors to co-managers of two of the hottest -- and most volatile -- mutual funds. In abandoning internal medicine for finance, Dr. Martinez followed their lead in joining Dresdner RCM to run its Biotechnology fund and its Global Health Care fund.</p>
        <p>No lives hung in the balance in Boston, but Dr. Martinez's employer had almost $1 billion at stake. His handicapping of the outcome would factor into decisions about whether Dresdner RCM should hold or sell that stock.</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Martinez was not breaking a sweat. ''Here, you have the responsibility for billions of dollars of investors' money,'' he said. ''Then, I had the responsibility for patients' lives. I think the stress as a doctor was greater. This can be bad, but it's worse when a patient's not doing well.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Martinez and his co-managers, Dr. Faraz Naqvi and Dr. Michael Dauchot, see their rare combination of skills as helping to explain why both of their funds have been among the best performers in their categories this year. And because biotechnology and health care have been two of the market's hottest sectors, the funds have been among the overall performance leaders, too. The Biotechnology fund had the highest return of any fund in the health care sector during the third quarter, 26.7 percent, and was the leading fund in any category over the last 12 months, with a gain of 263.9 percent. Global Health Care was up 18.8 percent for the quarter and 155.8 percent for the 12 months.</p>
        <p>Dr. Martinez, 35, was headed to business school at the University of California at Los Angeles when Dr. Naqvi, who knew him from their student days at Harvard Medical School, hired him a year ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. Naqvi, 34, earned a master's degree in economics from Cambridge University in England before medical school. As a radiology resident at the University of California at San Francisco, he was hired by McKinsey &amp; Company, the consulting firm. He later worked in stock research at Montgomery Securities, and then at Dresdner RCM.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dauchot, 37, also harbored a keen interest in business. For three years after he finished medical school, he spent his days seeing urgent-care patients at the Hammond Clinic in Munster, Ind., and his evenings in Chicago taking classes at the business school of Northwestern University.</p>
        <p>''I look at myself as first an investor and then a doctor,'' said Dr. Dauchot, who specializes in analyzing companies that make medical equipment. He saw a similarity between investing and his first career. ''In emergency medicine, you have to make some tough decisions with limited information,'' he said. ''You have to think quickly and just go with your gut in many cases.''</p>
        <p>The funds managed by this team belong to Dresdner RCM, a mutual fund company in San Francisco that is owned by Dresdner Bank of Germany. Both funds have no loads, or sales charges.</p>
        <p>Investors have taken notice. Near the end of 1999, Global Health Care had only $6 million in assets, and $4 million of that was a temporary investment by Dresdner Bank, the doctors said. The Biotechnology fund had about $14 million. Global Health Care now has about $180 million, and the Biotechnology fund has swelled to $950 million, they said.</p>
        <p>''A year ago, we were nonplayers. Nobody knew we ran mutual funds,'' Dr. Naqvi said. ''We've actually been getting tons of cash lately.''</p>
        <p>But Emily Hall, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, warned that the tide could run out as fast as it came in, forcing the managers to sell stocks to cash out investors. Health care sector funds, especially biotechnology funds, are notoriously cyclical, she said. Investors considering a leap into the sector should remember what became of the Internet stock funds that were last year's darlings.</p>
        <p>''The biotech sector has periods of unbridled optimism followed by periods of whatever the opposite of unbridled optimism is,'' Ms. Hall said. ''The bottom line of funds like these is that you need to be aware of your own tolerance for volatility.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Naqvi himself discourages investors from putting much more than 5 percent of their net worth into biotechnology stocks. The managers try to limit the funds' volatility by holding as many as 60 stocks in each, but even so, he said, ''I've told investors openly, biotech is really risky.''</p>
        <p>He and his co-managers attribute their impressive returns not only to their experience as doctors and their backgrounds in science, but also to their relative calm amid the market's volatility, especially in biotechnology stocks. They have stood out in the last year largely because they bought biotech stocks when other investors were rushing to sell them and because they made big, early bets on genomics stocks like Human Genome Sciences.</p>
        <p>''The reputation of doctors generally is they're terrible investors,'' Dr. Naqvi said. ''Some of the business decisions I've seen doctors make have left my head spinning.''</p>
        <p>THE managers may have spent more time studying patients' charts than stock charts, but ''we're really fundamental analysts,'' he said, in the sense that they  evaluate the financial promise of new drugs.</p>
        <p>''All the way from the small biotech companies to the giant pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly, what determines their stock price is how good their products are, and the best people to judge that are the doctors and the scientists who really know,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Naqvi and his colleagues understand that those products are developed not in a vacuum, but amid a swirl of legal and political forces that can be hard to predict. That is why Dr. Martinez spent a few days in a federal courthouse in Boston about a month ago, observing the trial of a patent infringement suit that Amgen had filed against a small biotech company, Transkaryotic Therapies, and a larger pharmaceutical company, Aventis of France. No decision has come down yet.</p>
        <p>Correctly timing the ups and downs of Amgen has served Dr. Naqvi's funds well. Last year, when the stock sank after the company announced second-quarter earnings, the Biotechnology fund poured 14 percent of its assets into the stock. As Amgen bounced back, it grew to account for about one-fifth of the fund. ''We made lots of money in Amgen,'' Dr. Naqvi said.</p>
        <p>Early this year, the managers sold about half of the Amgen shares. Then, as the end of the trial approached in late summer, they were again buying Amgen, thinking that there was only a 10 percent chance that the company would lose. As Dr. Naqvi explained it, they were preparing for the one sure thing in biotech investing: investors will overreact to news, good or bad.</p>
        <p>They figured that a victory could push up Amgen's stock by as much as $25 a share, to more than $90, while a loss could drive it down to less than $40. If Amgen won, they would stand pat and let the appreciation take Amgen to about 7 percent of the fund's assets. If Amgen lost, ''we would load up,'' Dr. Naqvi said. ''It would be a perfect time to make just an enormous overweight bet in Amgen.''</p>
        <p>Such willingness to take risks is what has made analysts like Ms. Hall wary about the funds since Dr. Naqvi became their lead manager in April 1999. Global Health Care had invested primarily in the biggest drug and health care companies. Dr. Naqvi sold many of those stocks and replaced them with Amgen and other biotechnology shares. Recently, as much as 35 percent of the fund has been in biotech, a greater weighting than most general health care funds ever have.</p>
        <p>''Both have been very aggressive funds since he took them over,'' said Ms. Hall, who was critical of Dr. Naqvi's fast-trading style in his first few months. She said it was difficult to judge whether the managers' experience as doctors gave them an advantage over other health care fund managers. ''These managers  don't have proven records in a variety of markets,'' she said.</p>
        <p>They faced their first test last spring. After shares of the biotech fund doubled in value in 1999 and doubled again in the first three months of 2000, they rapidly lost more than a third of their value in April as the Nasdaq swooned.</p>
        <p>Both Dr. Naqvi and Dr. Martinez said they were not rattled. Asked about the reversal, Dr. Naqvi recalled how, as a hospital intern, he suddenly was called upon to deliver a baby whose mother was a teenager high on crack. He had delivered only one other baby. ''Now, that's stress,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For Dr. Martinez, the spring sell-off taught him a lesson. ''You have to be able to capture market sentiment,'' he said. ''When the market reacts, the whole group may suffer. There were several phases where it seemed like it would recover, then hit new lows. That's tough.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Martinez said the managers joked that ''if we could have gone back to cash in March, we could have taken the rest of the year off.'' But because they try to stay fully invested, their best havens are big drug companies and what Dr. Martinez calls ''tools and supplies'' companies.</p>
        <p>Those are profitable companies, like Charles River Laboratories and Invitrogen, that are vendors to pure biotechnology companies, he said. Charles River Laboratories, which creates genetically altered mice and rats, was one of the biggest holdings in the biotech fund last quarter. Dr. Martinez called it a ''very low-risk way to capture the sector.''</p>
        <p>Amgen and another big name in biotechnology, Genentech, were also among the top holdings. Notably absent was another popular biotech company, Biogen. ''Wall Street has a very big bandwagon for Biogen, but we've never been on it,'' said Dr. Naqvi, who sees a lack of promising drugs in development. ''We don't believe they have a very good pipeline.''</p>
        <p>THEY prefer to take their chances on what they see as ''a diamond in the rough,'' Dr. Naqvi said. As an example, he cited Avant Immunotherapeutics, a company that is working on a vaccine to reduce cholesterol levels. When the company was recommended to them by an Amgen researcher, its stock was trading for less than $3 and no  analyst was following it, Dr. Naqvi said.</p>
        <p>After Dr. Martinez spent a day at the company earlier this year, talking to its executives and scientists, the managers decided, as Dr. Naqvi put it, that ''if this vaccine thing works, this stock is going to go up a hundredfold or 150-fold.'' They bought about 5 percent of the company's stock, which has risen to more than $10.</p>
        <p>Now they face the decision of whether to take a quick profit or to hold on through protracted clinical trials and regulatory approval processes for potentially much more. ''It depends on how strong our belief system is,'' he said. ''There are other times when we say. 'Boy, we have just made a killing in this stock; let's take a lot of our money off the table.' ''</p>
        <p>Then, of course, they would have to find a stock that promises bigger returns. As the third quarter ended, Dr. Naqvi said, they remained bullish on biotechnology shares, planning to keep the Global Health fund heavily invested in those stocks at least through October. After that, he predicted, investors will start shifting money from biotechs into pharmaceuticals on optimism that the election outcome will not threaten the industry's profits.</p>
        <p>''The biggest thing people are worried about is who's going to be in office,'' Dr. Naqvi said. His analysis: If Al Gore is elected, as he expects, and the Democrats gain control in Congress, drug stocks could fall 20 percent on fears of Mr. Gore's plan to change the Medicare system. By limiting some drug prices, that plan could reduce drug company earnings by 5 percent to 8 percent. But as long as the Republicans keep control of Congress, drug stocks will rise in the fourth quarter. And if George W. Bush is elected as well, that gain could be 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Doubting that the Democrats will sweep into the majority in Washington, Mr. Naqvi plans to keep the big biotechnology weighting in the Global Health Care fund until after the election and then to start shifting into pharmaceuticals. ''If my thesis holds out, we would try and reduce that down to lower than 20 percent, maybe 15 percent,'' Dr. Naqvi said of the health fund's huge biotechnology stake. ''At that point, we would be more of a balanced fund.''</p>
        <p>For all their longer-range strategizing, however, Dr. Naqvi and his colleagues are used to emergencies, willing to confer at any hour. ''We have a philosophy that we are 24 hours on call,'' he said. ''If something occurs in the middle of the night, we call each other.''</p>
