        <p>What child hasn't heard the tale of Oliver Twist, the orphan boy whose now-famous request for more food landed him in a den of thieves?</p>
        <p>But even those who actually read the book - Dickens's second work, serialized in monthly installments between 1837 and 1839 - maynot know about Oliver's desolate mother, her sea-captain husband and that other man, the boy's real father.</p>
        <p>Tonight, in the first of three episodes of a Masterpiece Theater production of ''Oliver Twist,'' viewers will receive a lesson in Twist family genealogy - thanks to Alan Bleasdale, the screenwriter and an executive producer of the mini-series, which will be shown at 9 p.m. on Channel 13.</p>
        <p>While rereading the novel, Mr. Bleasdale stumbled upon a short ''back story'' that described how Oliver actually came to be born.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was a wonderful story, and it had never been told,'' said Mr. Bleasdale in a telephone interview from Liverpool, his lifelong home.</p>
        <p>Those few pages of background were without a word of dialogue, which meant that Mr. Bleasdale would have to create his own. ''I was nervous about working alongside this tremendous novel,'' he said. But the act of bringing the background to life gave him the confidence to adapt the rest of the story.</p>
        <p>He did this with his usual method of writing with a particular actor in mind, said Robert Lindsay, the Tony and Olivier Award winner who plays Fagin, the fatherly felon. ''When he writes my character's dialogue,'' Mr. Lindsay said, ''he has my photograph on his typewriter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bleasdale turned Fagin into a street magician from Prague, he said, ''because in the book he had this wonderfully frightening, charismatic hold on the children.''</p>
        <p>''I remember when our children were very young,'' he added. ''I would play tricks impersonating something pathetically resembling a magician - they were spellbound by it.''</p>
