        <p>THE Nassau County towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay have approved referendums for Nov. 7 on spending a total of $45 million for acquisitions of open space, environmental restoration, park improvements and ground and surface water protection.</p>
        <p>The referendums, the first of their kind in either town, will measure public appetite for environmental spending at a time when the Nassau County government is in a financial crisis over budget deficits that may lead to higher county taxes, and when countywide property reassessment is raising other uncertainties about future tax rates.</p>
        <p>The initiatives mark a significant westward shift for environmental-protection proposals. Elected officials and voters in Suffolk County have approved several such proposals in the last 30 years, resulting in more than $270 million in public spending to finance some of the most far-reaching open-space and water-protection efforts in the country.</p>
        <p>The new initiatives also mirror open-space bond programs on the ballot this year in several towns in Westchester County, including a $4 million open-space referendum in Bedford.</p>
        <p>Officials in North Hempstead and Oyster Bay said that voter approval of their referendums would allow the towns to seek matching funds from state and federal programs and more than double the amount available to carry out local goals.</p>
        <p>The North Hempstead program would issue bonds to create a $15 million Environmental Legacy Fund that would include $8 million for open-space purchases, $4 million for restoring and protecting environmentally sensitive lands such as wetlands, and $3 million for improvements in coastal areas and waterways. A 17-member committee would set criteria and recommend projects and acquisitions to the town board, which would make the final decisions.</p>
        <p>May W. Newburger, the North Hempstead town supervisor, said that the fund was designed to maximize the contributions from other levels of government. ''We planned it so that we were addressing things for which we could get matching state and federal funds,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Newburger, a Democrat, said that town spending, which would take place over the next several years, would be spread evenly. ''This must be structured in a way that addresses all areas of the town,'' she said. Town officials estimate that the $15 million program would cost an average taxpayer less than $9 a year over the 15-year life of the bonds.</p>
        <p>In Oyster Bay, town residents will vote on a proposed $30 million environmental bond issue that officials said would add $19.44 a year to an average taxpayer's bill for the first 15 years and less than half that amount annually for the next 15 years to retire a combination of 15- and 30-year bonds.</p>
        <p>The Oyster Bay fund would provide $20 million for acquisition of environmentally sensitive lands and $10 million for improvements to parks and recreational facilities.  Acquisition funds could be spent for open-space corridors, groundwater protection areas, woodlands, shorelines and areas of environmental significance or with rare or unique features.</p>
        <p>A seven-member committee to be appointed by the town supervisor, with members including the town attorney, the commissioners of parks and public works, and four members from civic and environmental groups, would make recommendations to the town board.</p>
        <p>The town supervisor, John Venditto, said that in a meeting held Sept. 7, town board members unanimously approved placing the referendum on the ballot. ''It's an idea whose time has come,'' Mr. Venditto said. ''We've been getting input from virtually all levels of the community about having this type of bond issue, and we've spent a great deal of time looking into what other municipalities have been doing.''</p>
        <p>As in North Hempstead, the Oyster Bay officials said that money the town put up for programs would make the town eligible for matching funds. ''You have to have money to get money,'' said Councilwoman Bonnie Eisler, a first-term Democrat, who urged the referendum vote. ''Right now the matching money is going everywhere else because we haven't put money up front.''</p>
        <p>IN North Hempstead, Mrs. Newburger and two Democratic members of the town board approved that town's $15 million referendum in a vote on Sept. 5. One Republican councilman, James P. O'Connor, was opposed. A second Republican on the five-member board was absent.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connor said the town plan placed the burden of preservation on local residents, unlike measures passed in the five eastern towns of Suffolk County in 1998 that raised money for environmental programs with a 2 percent real estate transfer tax paid by buyers. ''We are all for protecting the environment, that's a no-brainer,'' Mr. O'Connor said. ''But I was hoping to see something a little more creative. This is a lost opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connor said the plan also lacked specificity. ''What open space are they talking about,'' he said, ''and where, and how much?''</p>
        <p>Officials in North Hempstead and Oyster Bay and advocates of the ballot proposals said that specifying properties that would be acquisition targets would raise their cost and lock towns into buying them even if better opportunities arose. ''If you list a piece of property, you know what happens to the price,'' Mrs. Newburger said.</p>
        <p>Lynn Oliva, an environmental adviser to North Hempstead, said that purchase decisions would be made by the town board based on recommendations of the advisory committee. She said the committee would set criteria and a ranking system with attention to assuring that all parts of the town were dealt with equally. Residents have also been invited to propose acquisitions and projects.</p>
        <p>''That's the beauty of the town's process,'' she said. ''You have an advisory committee, and residents can nominate various sites.''</p>
        <p>Robert Wieboldt, the executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute in Islandia, said the homebuilders' group did not contest that towns had ''a legitimate role in the acquisition of open space.''</p>
        <p>''The key question is the prioritization of the funds once they are taken in,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Officials said the advisory committees would be unlikely to approve purchases or projects that served narrow interests. ''There is a mechanism here to be fair,'' Ms. Oliva said, speaking of the North Hempstead plan. ''But that doesn't mean that there couldn't be a consensus that a particular piece of property is important to a neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>Real estate groups have not taken a position on the referendums. Joseph E. Mottola, the chief executive officer of the Long Island Board of Realtors and Multiple Listing Service, said in a prepared statement that real estate brokers ''sell and market not only homes, commercial facilities and land, but also a community's quality of life.''</p>
        <p>''To customers, the community surrounding the property is as important as the property itself,'' he said. But he said real estate interests had ''found themselves on the front lines of the growth debate, trying to articulate a position that balances potentially conflicting needs.'' He said these were ''maintaining the quality of communities through preservation of space and control of congestion'' while ''allowing market forces to generate local growth.''</p>
        <p>But local officials supporting the referendums said that extreme development pressure in the two towns had galvanized almost universal support for preserving what open spaces and environmentally sensitive areas remained. ''Frankly, this is something we should have done 25 years ago,'' Mrs. Newburger said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Venditto, a Republican, said that a townwide mailing and three public hearings were planned to inform residents about the Oyster Bay environmental bond. He said that the proposal had strong support from civic and environmental groups and that he knew of no groups that opposed it.</p>
        <p>In North Hempstead, where a number of public hearings have already been held, environmental and civic groups have formed a coalition to support passage of the town's referendum.</p>
        <p>''All across the whole United States, people want their government to preserve open space and their way of life,'' said Myron Blumenfeld, the chairman of Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington, a coalition member. ''And we believe this fund will do that for us.''</p>
        <p>Nassau County has never proposed a major environmental program involving a referendum vote. Officials and environmental and civic groups have said they believe it is unlikely the county could consider such programs until its current fiscal crisis is resolved.</p>
