        <p>With 18 fire companies under his command and 15,000 emergency calls a year, Fire Commissioner Peter S. Guyett of Yonkers is changing the way his city aids neighboring communities. While  Yonkers will still answer calls in emergencies, the city has told Eastchester and Mount Vernon that it will not send firefighters to sit in a firehouse as backup. ''We have our own emergencies,'' Mr. Guyett said. ''I can't afford to supplement their budgets on the backs of the citizens of Yonkers.'' He said the 38-year-old mutual aid agreement needs revamping.</p>
