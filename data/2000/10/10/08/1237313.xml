        <p>In their shockingly brief postseason, the Atlanta Braves never contained Jim Edmonds. They never played like the defending National League champions. And they never beat the impressive St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
        <p>Sweeping Atlanta, and advancing to the National League Championship Series, the Cardinals rolled to a 7-1 victory this afternoon at Turner Field that looked stunningly easy. The Cardinals did not just win this three-of-five-game division series. They dominated it, outscoring Atlanta, 24-10, over three games, pounding one of baseball's best pitching staffs.</p>
        <p>Edmonds, the Cardinals' center fielder, was sensational in the series, going 8 for 14 with two home runs and seven runs batted in. He set a division series record with six extra-base hits. It was a terrific performance by one of the game's best players, but as a group, the Cardinals were superior in every phase of the game.</p>
        <p>''There was no fear, no backing off,'' said a Champagne-soaked Will Clark, who has been a major contributor to the Cardinals since being acquired in a July 31 trade. ''We took it to them. And we beat them.''</p>
        <p>The Braves will spend another off-season trying to explain their latest postseason failure, but this exit was their most embarrassing by far. They have won nine consecutive division titles, but only one World Series (1995), and the way this year ended will surely bring off-season changes. After outlasting the Mets in a season-long battle to win the N.L. East, the Braves played flat, sloppy baseball at the worst possible time.</p>
        <p>''We didn't get it done, and that's what people are going to remember,'' said Tom Glavine, Atlanta's 21-game winner, who had a terrible start in Game 2, surrendering seven runs in less than three innings. ''It's easy to say we were complacent or whatever. We've only won one World Series, and we can analyze that until we're blue in the face. But I guarantee you that it's not because we were complacent, or that we took winning for granted. We know how hard it is to win. After what we did during the regular season, there was no indication that we would come out and play like that.''</p>
        <p>The Braves never seemed to recover from their final regular-season game, when they lost a ninth-inning lead to the Colorado Rockies and home-field advantage in the playoffs. That set the stage for their downfall. The Cardinals opened the series with a six-run first inning and never stopped, getting contributions from top to bottom in their balanced lineup.</p>
        <p>It took only two pitches for the Cardinals to take the lead today, when Fernando Vina hit a leadoff home run against Atlanta's Kevin Millwood. A run-scoring single by Andres Galarraga tied the game in the bottom of the first inning, but Edmonds gave St. Louis the lead for good with a a two-run homer in the third inning.</p>
        <p>Millwood made his first mistake with Edmonds by falling behind, 2-0, in the count. Then Millwood made an even bigger mistake, throwing his next pitch down the middle of the plate to a hitter who was hotter than July. Edmonds did not miss it, crushing a 418-foot homer that easily cleared the fence in right field. Edmonds thrust his hand into the air while rounding first base, knowing he had given the Cardinals the lead, which they kept for good.</p>
        <p>''I've said it all year: Fernando Vina is the table setter and Jim Edmonds mops it up,'' Clark said.</p>
        <p>''It's a great feeling,'' said Edmonds, who made his first career postseason series a memorable one. ''We had a great regular season, and we've carried that into the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Edmonds did not stop after his homer, doubling home Edgar Renteria in the fifth inning for the fourth St. Louis run. The Cardinals turned the game into a rout with a three-run sixth. St. Louis put runners on second and third, forcing the desperate Braves to move the infield in.</p>
        <p>Placido Polanco hit a sharp ground ball to second base that was smothered by Keith Lockhart, but instead of taking the sure out at first base, Lockhart hurriedly threw home to try to get Ray Lankford streaking from third base. Lankford beat the throw, and the Cardinals led, 5-1. Then Vina provided the finishing touch, hitting a two-run single off the reliever Mike Remlinger to give St. Louis a 7-1 lead, sending the Braves fans in the crowd of 49,898 into stunned silence, while the numerous Cardinal fans in the crowd cheered wildly.</p>
        <p>Throughout the series, the Braves failed to get key hits, made fielding blunders and received poor pitching. Andruw Jones misplayed a fly ball in the outfield in Game 1 and had only one hit in the series. Chipper Jones had only two hits, and he made two errors at third base, a terrible series for a player whom the Braves depend upon. When Chipper Jones struck out to lead off the ninth inning today, he heard some boos from Braves fans who had bothered to stick around.</p>
        <p>''It was disappointing the way I ended the season,'' Chipper Jones said. ''It's almost like we peaked before we even started playing.''</p>
        <p>But for the Braves, there was plenty of blame to go around. Their two best pitchers were pummeled in St. Louis: Greg Maddux in Game 1, and Glavine in Game 2. And when Manager Bobby Cox decided to start Millwood today instead of Maddux on three days' rest, that decision did not pay off either.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Cardinals will look forward to playing either the Mets or the San Francisco Giants for a trip to the World Series. The Cardinals lost their starting pitcher in the fourth inning, when Garrett Stephenson was forced to leave because of stiffness in his right elbow. But the Cardinals got shutout pitching from Britt Reames, who pitched one and a third innings and got the victory, Mike James, Matt Morris and Dave Veres.</p>
        <p>''If I had to bet a dollar, I would have never bet it,'' Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa said, when asked if he thought St. Louis would sweep before the series began. ''But if you go out and play hard, you never know.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHIPPER JONES of the Braves took one last dig at the Mets when asked how he thought the Cardinals would fare in the National League Championship Series. ''I hope they beat the Mets if they play them,'' Jones said. ''If they play the Giants, I'll be totally impartial.''</p>
