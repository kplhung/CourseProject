        <p>Even revolutions have a day after. Serbia's came today beneath a pale sun that illuminated the giddying contradictions of the national soul -- uplifted by the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, disoriented by his long rule, alternately vengeful and compromising, angry and cowed.</p>
        <p>The election posters from the Sept. 24 presidential election are still up. ''Who speaks for all of us?'' says one. ''Kostunica of course.'' That was true of these last heady days as Vojislav Kostunica, the quiet lawyer-turned-insurrectionist, led the storming of the Serbian Bastille.</p>

        <p>Even revolutions have a day after. Serbia's came today beneath a pale sun that illuminated the giddying contradictions of the national soul -- uplifted by the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, disoriented by his long rule, alternately vengeful and compromising, angry and cowed.</p>
        <p>The election posters from the Sept. 24 presidential election are still up. ''Who speaks for all of us?'' says one. ''Kostunica of course.'' That was true of these last heady days as Vojislav Kostunica, the quiet lawyer-turned-insurrectionist, led the storming of the Serbian Bastille.</p>
        <p>His success hinged on representing a sort of lowest common denominator of opposition to the Milosevic regime: a democrat but also a nationalist, a Westernizer suspicious of the West, a compromiser with principles, a ''true Serb'' unafraid to voice a few painful truths. And so a thousand hopes have been vested in him.</p>
        <p>But on the first day of the post-Milosevic era, as stores opened and poor pensioners shuffled past the peeling plaster of the bruised city of Belgrade, it was clear enough that Mr. Kostunica would be hard pressed to go on speaking ''for all of us,'' so varied is the spectrum of Serbian sentiment.</p>
        <p>''As far as I'm concerned, turn Milosevic over to the criminal tribunal in The Hague for all the crimes in the wars from 1991 to 1999,'' said Dragan Jonovic, 38, unemployed. ''No,'' retorted Milos Vojinovic, a 26-year-old state employee. ''We should leave him alone because what's gone is gone and the past is finished.''</p>
        <p>The fact is, the past is generally very much present in post-Communist or post-dictatorial societies, and for all Mr. Kostunica's evident political skills, he may be hard pressed to steer a path between those seeking justice and those with an interest in amnesia.</p>
        <p>What has fallen is not merely Mr. Milosevic, but the system he inherited and adapted, whose roots go back to Tito's Communist victory of 1945. The potential reckonings between the turncoats and the persecuted, the winners and the losers, appear innumerable and treacherous.</p>
        <p>But there was peace on the streets today. A peace almost eerie, shocking when set against the enormity of what has happened. The hand Mr. Kostunica was apparently prepared to extend to Mr. Milosevic in negotiating his exit from power suggests that the new president will do all he can to avoid confrontation and sustain this tranquillity.</p>
        <p>He has enormous good will on his side, as well as a weariness that is certain to produce a lot of inertia, and the support of the West, relieved to see at last the dim outline of a trail leading out of the decade-long bog of post-Communist Balkan conflict.</p>
        <p>''We turned eastward but now I am confident we can turn westward and heal our wounds,'' said Olga Vasic, a doctor. ''There is no sense in punishing Milosevic. It would only cause problems. Becoming powerless is already the greatest humiliation for him. How can we punish him more?''</p>
        <p>Hearing these remarks at a street market, Malina Popovic, minding a small stall selling red peppers, strode forward and shouted: ''How can you say that? Milosevic brought us to the abyss, and he has to be tried.''</p>
        <p>This demand, however, was not enough for Malina's husband, Miroslav Popovic, a farmer from eastern Serbia who ekes out a living bringing his produce to the city every day. ''Milosevic should be hanged on Terazije,'' he said, referring to a central Belgrade street. ''He has humiliated us all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Popovic is a royalist who seeks the return of the Serbian royal family, now in exile in London. No shade of political opinion is missing from this depressed corner of Europe, where isolation and propaganda turned or twisted many minds, making for a volatile brew.</p>
        <p>But if one sentiment seemed overwhelming as Mr. Kostunica prepared to take office today, it was that Serbia should find a way to ''return to Europe,'' ending its long and increasingly painful isolation.</p>
        <p>''The whole world thinks we are Balkan savages,'' said Mladen Jevericic, a 20-year-old law student. ''My friends were in Italy this summer, and the Italians were amazed that we had heard of Sting. What I want is for us to come into Europe now.''</p>
        <p>The leaders of the European Union seem to want that, too, and have indicated that some economic sanctions against Serbia will be lifted imminently now that Mr. Milosevic has gone.</p>
        <p>What is not clear, however, is what degree of forgetfulness and compromise Western governments want to show over the very events that gave rise to the images of Serbian savagery that the young Mr. Jevericic resents.</p>
        <p>Will the names of Omarska and Srebrenica and Racak -- scenes of some of the most infamous atrocities in the Balkan wars -- come back to haunt Serbs or will these emblems of Serbian brutality in Bosnia and Kosovo be quietly shuffled into a back drawer?</p>
        <p>Formally, Western governments are committed to trying Mr. Milosevic on charges of war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. Mr. Kostunica says he will not arrest Mr. Milosevic, for war crimes or even for the former leader's apparent electoral fraud that alone is a criminal offense carrying a potential sentence of three years.</p>
        <p>Western governments could decide to endorse this approach, overlooking -- at least for now -- their formal demands. They may also try to change Mr. Kostunica's mind. What is clear is that the new president's ability to deliver the ''Europe'' apparently sought by a majority of Serbs will involve a delicate balancing act.</p>
        <p>The other concern of Mr. Jevericic, the student, was with Montenegro, where he worries that the president, Milo Djukanovic, is pushing for independence. He is opposed to that, and uncertain what to do about Kosovo, treasured by Serbs as the center of their medieval empire. ''There are perhaps 50,000 Serbs and 2 million Albanians there now,'' he said. ''It's hard to see a solution.''</p>
        <p>The best solution that Mr. Jonovic, the unemployed enthusiast for trying Mr. Milosevic, could see was to turn back the clock. ''If we had only divorced in Yugoslavia like the Czech Republic and Slovakia, we would have been the first to enter the European Union. In Communist times, we were the West for Czechs and Poles.''</p>
        <p>But that of course is the past, and the past, for now, is finished.</p>
