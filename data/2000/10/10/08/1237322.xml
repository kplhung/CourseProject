        <p>Bill Brody says he would have challenged this village's condemnation of the four downtown buildings that he owned and had just renovated into office and retail space, and that Port Chester officials plan to turn over to a developer for a Stop &amp; Shop supermarket.</p>
        <p>But he never got to fight that fight.</p>
        <p>For all the steps Mr. Brody took in his effort to follow every turn in Port Chester's 27-acre downtown renewal plan, he missed a classified legal notice in a local newspaper last year saying the property was eligible for condemnation. He did not learn about the notice until 10 months later, too late to contest the decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brody is one of three property owners in the New York area who are challenging the constitutionality of the state's eminent-domain procedures in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The other two plaintiffs are the owner of a cabinetmaking business in Harlem and a church in North Hempstead, on Long Island.</p>
        <p>A ruling in the plaintiffs' favor  could change the way the state and local governments acquire millions of dollars' worth of property every year for a range of projects, including new sidewalks and sports stadiums. The process has come under increasing scrutiny as more government agencies are acting as conduits for the transfer of property from one private owner to another.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Judge Harold Baer Jr. issued a temporary order barring the condemnations until he could hear the owners' motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>
        <p>The New York law does require a public hearing, but only in the early stages of the lengthy process that can lead to the condemnation of a property. At that hearing, government officials must explain the potential cost and the public benefit of a proposed project, and members of the public may speak briefly. But the officials do not have to answer questions, or permit the property owner to call witnesses or present more than brief objections.</p>
        <p>Nor does the law require a government agency or official to directly notify an owner when, sometime after the hearing, a property is identified as subject to condemnation in a legal notice. Such identification may come months or years before the government begins court proceedings to actually seize the property.</p>
        <p>Once the notice appears, an owner has 30 days to appeal. The notice is not required to mention this time limit, or the right to appeal.</p>
        <p>As a result, land-use lawyers say, owners often learn months or years after the 30-day period has expired that they are being displaced.</p>
        <p>''New York's is the weirdest statute I've ever seen,'' said Dana Berliner, a lawyer for the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm in Washington, which filed the complaint by Mr. Brody and the others.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berliner said that in many states, the government's court petition for condemnation might be the first notice to a property owner. But almost all other states notify the owner of his right to appeal.</p>
        <p>The cabinetmaking shop, on East 117th Street, is on the site of a retail center planned by the State Urban Development Corporation. The center would include a Home Depot and a Costco discount warehouse store.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Brody, the owners of the cabinetmaking shop, William J. Minnich and his nephew Bill Minnich, went to a public hearing, but were given only three minutes to speak.</p>
        <p>According to the suit, no one explained that the hearing would result in a final decision. When the decision was announced in September 1999, the Minniches were notified by mail and told that they could appeal. But the suit says the notice made no reference to a time limit.</p>
        <p>When the Minniches went to State Supreme Court in Manhattan to challenge the condemnation, their suit was dismissed because the time limit had expired.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the development agency, Maura Gallucci, said the agency could not comment on this week's lawsuit, but was ''taking the proper steps in this process.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gallucci said the agency's plans for the center had been widely known. ''This project started out with a very public announcement by the governor and the mayor,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, the third plaintiff, St. Luke's Pentecostal Church of Westbury, a village in the town of North Hempstead, bought a building that had been scheduled for condemnation as part of an urban renewal plan. The church maintains that this fact was not publicly recorded and  did not turn up in the title search.</p>
        <p>''How were they supposed to know?'' Ms. Berliner asked. ''They went to the building department before they purchased their property and got a full go-ahead.''</p>
        <p>After spending $130,000 for the building and hundreds of thousands more on renovation and repairs, the suit says, the church was notified last November that it would receive $80,000 for its property from the North Hempstead Community Development Agency. The congregation, which now rents space in the basement of another building, is allowed by law to contest the amount, but not the condemnation.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the town, Martin N. Kroll, said the church had been advised that the building was in an urban renewal area.</p>
        <p>In any event, he said, the church could not have successfully challenged the condemnation because the property was designated for subsidized housing, clearly recognized as a ''public use.'' Under the law, a condemnation must serve a public purpose, and the owner must receive fair compensation.</p>
        <p>Most courts have found that promoting development and creating jobs are public purposes, even if they require seizing property from one owner and turning it over to another.</p>
        <p>But as local governments have grown bolder, some have lost. Last year, three property owners in Atlantic City won a ruling barring the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment Development Authority's plan to buy them out so the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino could expand.</p>
        <p>The New York suit argues that property owners have no opportunity to raise such claims.</p>
        <p>''These procedural questions are not petty,'' said Norman Marcus, a Manhattan land-use lawyer and former general counsel to the New York City Planning Commission. In the case of the three New York owners, he said, ''the procedures killed them.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Port Chester could not be reached by telephone for comment this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brody said he wanted to contest Port Chester's finding, made years ago, that the downtown area was ''blighted,'' and to argue that a supermarket and parking lot would serve the public no better than the 10 businesses that are his tenants.</p>
        <p>He also said he had many discussions with the planning and zoning department as he proceeded with renovations.</p>
        <p>''If you're doing work in an urban development zone and somebody else wants to come in and they like that use better, that's it,'' he said. ''Nobody told me that.''</p>
