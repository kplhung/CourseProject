        <p>IN the stock market's new world order, boring is beautiful and the dazzlers have been dimmed.</p>
        <p>That, at least, was the story in the third quarter. After years of outperformance, most of the stock market's raciest shares were overtaken by the mundane. Value funds beat growth funds almost across the board, and big-company stock funds lagged behind those that invest in smaller companies' shares. Even more unusual, Treasury bonds outperformed most growth stock indexes.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most distressing to investors who have poured money into technology stocks, the gains of tech funds were far outpaced by funds that bought financial and health care stocks or real estate assets. Even funds that invest in electric utility stocks, as prosaic as the stock market has to offer, walloped the technology funds during the quarter. Only one group of glamour stocks -- the biotechnology sector -- continued to shine.</p>
        <p>While the average diversified stock fund investing in United States companies gained 2.31 percent in the quarter, large-company growth funds fell 0.44 percent. Value funds investing in large-company shares gained 4.87 percent, but those buying shares of middle-tier companies surged 8.43 percent.</p>
        <p>Of course, all of those returns were much better than the performance of the broad market indexes. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.2 percent for the quarter and 2.2 percent for the first nine months of the year, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 7.4 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.94 percent for the quarter but down 7.4 percent for the nine months.</p>
        <p>Still, investors have a right to be stunned by the recent turnabout in the mutual fund sweepstakes. Growth stocks are still ahead over the past 12 months, but at the current rate of change, the one-year totals may reverse soon, too.</p>
        <p>Christine A. Callies, the chief United States investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said she believed that the shift in the market's leadership reflected a new aversion to risk and a greater appreciation of value.</p>
        <p>''The market's struggle with the issue of fair value is nowhere more evident than in the technology sector,'' Ms. Callies said.</p>
        <p>She noted that six months ago, many investors believed that the technology companies with the highest price-to-earnings ratios were invulnerable. But the prices of many of them have since plummeted.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of the shift, according to A. Marshall Acuff Jr., a market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, is that the strategy of concentration  -- in which a fund manager bets on a small number of stocks -- appears to be less profitable than that of diversification. ''Since this spring, the number of stocks rising in price has been increasing,'' Mr. Acuff said. That represents a big change from previous years, when a tiny raft of stocks was responsible for all the gains in the broad market indexes.</p>
        <p>''Back in March and April we began to see a rational rebalancing of the excesses in the market.'' he said. ''We're seeing a continued play-out. We're still going to have some high-priced stocks, but the reality is we continue to see almost weekly shortfalls in growth expectations.''</p>
        <p>Recently, such diverse but humdrum groups as tobacco, oil services and financial services have been pulling ahead.</p>
        <p>ROBERT ADLER, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks fund flows, confirmed that investors were seeking a broader focus. ''Equity inflows have been declining in technology and index funds but have stood up fairly well in the large-cap growth area,'' Mr. Adler said. ''Investors are giving portfolio managers surrogate power to move beyond technology to those sectors that are performing well. Technology no longer reigns as a specific focus.''</p>
        <p>In the first quarter, for instance, technology stock funds received 28.3 percent of mutual fund inflows, Mr. Adler said. That figure fell to 11.7 percent in the second quarter and 9.7 percent in the third.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for investors who have grown used to buying funds that mirror the performance of a broad market index, this strategy, too, has been lagging behind. For many years, this passive and appealingly low-cost approach trounced the stock-picking of so-called active fund managers. But in the third quarter,  active management triumphed. The  Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the basis of most index funds, lost 1 percent in the third quarter, compared with the gain of more than 2 percent for the average diversified stock fund.</p>
        <p>Even among active managers, many winners and losers have been trading places, reflecting the depth and breadth of the market's shift. The most successful active managers of recent years are beginning to falter, and picking future winners based on funds' past performance is becoming more difficult, according to statisticians at Morningstar Inc. who studied performance over the last decade.</p>
        <p>For each year, the researchers chose the 25 top performers -- based on their previous three-year gains -- and looked at how they performed the next year. On average during the 1990's, they found, these funds ranked within the top one-third of all funds in performance. But for the first nine months of 2000, the three-year leaders, including past favorites like Janus Twenty and Rydex OTC Investors, have settled squarely in the middle of the pack.</p>
        <p>Topping the winners' list among diversified stock funds in the third quarter was the New Alternatives fund, which invests in small-cap companies. It rose 32.04 percent. Among the value funds turning up in the top 20 were Seligman Large Cap Value A, up 17.55 percent, and Vontobel U.S. Value, up 17.25 percent.</p>
        <p>One diversification method that did not work well in the third quarter was investing abroad. The average international stock fund lost 6.7 percent of its value, largely a result of  sharp declines in the values of the euro and the Japanese yen against the dollar. But economic woes in Asia also contributed to the dismal returns. The average fund investing in the Pacific Rim, including Japan,  lost 12.58 percent of its value. Those investing in Japanese stocks alone fell 9.93 percent, on average.</p>
        <p>With all the major market indexes registering losses for the first three quarters, some market strategists have wondered how the declines will affect investor and consumer behavior. After all, the stock markets have been delivering historically high returns for the last five years.</p>
        <p>As for investor behavior, equity fund inflows have been declining throughout the year, Mr. Adler said, from $113.7 billion in the first quarter to $50 billion in the second quarter and $36.7 billion in the third.</p>
        <p>The effect on consumers is less clear. Stock gains have obviously helped keep shoppers on spending sprees, which in turn have kept the economy moving. Will investment losses make them reign in their spending, threatening world economic growth?</p>
        <p>Judging from one barometer, a considerably larger market tumble will be needed to scare away consumers. According to an annual PaineWebber/Gallup survey, involving 1,000 Americans, those with investable financial assets like securities and cash say their portfolios would have to fall 27 percent before they would feel it necessary to reduce spending.</p>
        <p>Many market strategists note, too, that in each of the last two years, a weak third quarter has set the stage for a strong final quarter. In the third quarter of 1999, American stock funds lost just over 4 percent of their value, on average. Then they rebounded mightily, rising 21 percent in the final quarter.</p>
        <p>The story was similar in 1998. A nasty, 13 percent loss in the third quarter gave way to an almost 20 percent gain in the last three months of the year.</p>
        <p>WILL the past be a prologue? Charles H. Blood, Jr., managing director at Brown Brothers Harriman, said he believes so. As it becomes clearer that the  Federal Reserve's interest rate increases have achieved a slowdown in economic growth, he said, it will also become more obvious to the Fed that it can lower rates late this year. And when that change in monetary policy becomes clear to investors, Mr. Blood said, he expects the broad market indexes to rally.</p>
        <p>For the moment, however, investors who have grown used to following the leaders, or simply throwing money at an index, have work to be done and a new crowd to assess. While many investors may be tempted to hunt for bargains in technology, few strategists believe that these shares will turn in the type of returns that they did when the economy was racing. And even though many of the hottest stocks have cooled, most of the former highflyers remain expensive by traditional valuation methods.</p>
        <p>If an economic slowdown unfolds as Mr. Blood expects, some of the same companies that have done well in recent months should continue to shine. Electric utilities will benefit if the Fed cuts rates, as will financial services and companies investing in real estate. So taking up with the new stars in the mutual fund firmament could prove rewarding in the future, too.</p>
