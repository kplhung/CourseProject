        <p>The setting is reassuring enough: a weathered stone house near a mountaintop on the island of Corsica, the Mediterranean glistening in the distance. Behind the windows are lace curtains and sepia portraits of grandparents on the wall.</p>
        <p>But the history of Francois Santoni, who is waiting in the living room, is anything but peaceful.</p>
        <p>Over 20 years he climbed from foot soldier to redoubtable military leader of the Corsican National Liberation Front, one of several groups using terror to gain independence from France. By the rebels' count, since 1976, there have been 10,000 bombings and 220 assassinations.</p>
        <p>Now, there seems to be a chance to halt the bloodshed. France is offering broad autonomy, and Mr. Santoni is among the rebel leaders who believe that the proposal is worthy of acceptance and offers a genuine chance to break with the violent past.</p>
        <p>''Sure I have blood on my hands,'' says Mr. Santoni, holding a tiny coffee and shifting his large, 40-year old frame on the sofa. He tries to soften the harsh impact of his words as they linger. ''Having blood on your hands does not have to mean literally killing someone, but creating the situation or being part of it.''</p>
        <p>While in prison, two years ago, he said he broke with the armed struggle. Yet blood has just been spilled again, this time horribly close to the former rebel chief: Jean-Michel Rossi, his best friend, co-author and longtime alter-ego in the nationalist movement, was gunned down on August 7 in an outdoor cafe.</p>
        <p>The killing, like most assassinations in Corsica, remains a mystery. However, it may have a significance that most of the deaths in this struggle have not: Mr. Rossi's death came after the two comrades-in-arms had just published their joint memoirs, the most candid chronicle yet from a shadowy world.</p>
        <p>Their accounts cast a cold light all around: on corruption, infighting and splits among the rebels, on their dealings with the Mafia, on police turning a blind eye and on Paris officials holding secret meetings with the rebels and denying it.</p>
        <p>Most of all, ''Closing Accounts'' is an extraordinary confession of how a movement that wanted self-rule and social justice for the island was gradually corrupted by money and the cult of violence.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Rossi's killing, the book has bolted to the top of the French nonfiction best-seller list, with more than 90,000 copies sold. The French have long been fascinated and repelled by the violence of Corsica, the rugged island that produced Napoleon Bonaparte, a legendary pirate culture and plenty of weapons and rough justice. Corsicans have held a low opinion of Parisians ever since they became French in 1768.</p>
        <p>The book and Mr. Rossi's assassination have coincided with a crucial moment in the French government's drawn-out efforts to settle its problems with the troubled island.</p>
        <p>Corsica is to France what Northern Ireland is to Britain and the Basque country to Spain -- a place of cyclical talks, broken truces and more fusillades squandering more blood.</p>
        <p>This summer, after months of negotiations with Corsican nationalists, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France offered new powers that would grant limited self-rule to the island's 250,000 inhabitants in exchange for an end to violence. The offer was fiercely disputed in mainland France, with conservatives and others warning that if France loosened its grip on Corsica, this would trigger demands from other regions and could unravel the nation.</p>
        <p>Many Corsicans, however, including former separatists like Mr. Santoni and Mr. Rossi, argued that Mr. Jospin's plan offered the best chance for peace. It will be debated in Parliament in Paris later this year.</p>
        <p>The memoirs, told in the form of long answers to questions posed by Guy Benhamou, a journalist, make clear that even Corsican rebels are weary of the fight, and of the corruption and crime that it engendered. Government officials familiar with Corsican affairs say that, on the whole, the book is credible, while other rebels have variously disputed or endorsed its accounts. Mr. Benhamou has now received death threats and has been put under official protection.</p>
        <p>Did Mr. Rossi die because of the revelations in the memoirs? ''I think Jean-Michel would have been killed even without the book,'' Mr. Santoni said. ''He'd been threatened for some time because he was very critical of corruption.''</p>
        <p>The 250-page book traces the front from its creation in 1976 by university students -- who at first did little more than throw firebombs at government, police and military buildings. Revolutionary morality then called for crusades, such as antidrug campaigns. These resulted, the book says, in the execution of about 40 people. Among them were North Africans, who had set up a ''very active drug trafficking network'' in southern Corsica to raise money for Algeria's Islamic fundamentalist rebels.</p>
        <p>Another group singled out by the Corsican rebels was real estate developers. Resisting what they said was development that would push rugged, beautiful Corsica the way of the cement-covered French Riviera, the rebels began blowing up hotels, apartment complexes or holiday villas.</p>
        <p>But, the book says, the self-appointed guardians of Corsica's landscape have remained far from pure. The tourist industry became a prime target for the extortion of ''revolutionary taxes,'' according to the book. It says that one large French tour operator, after several bombings, bought peace by giving a half million dollars to a soccer club and $130,000 a year for advertisements in U Ribombu, a nationalist magazine. An exclusive seaside golf club paid $1 million, but was still attacked.</p>
        <p>As the front split into competing factions, all of which practiced ''revolutionary fund-raising,'' the nationalists found themselves bumping into the underworld.</p>
        <p>One spectacular example involved the island of Cavallo, just south of Corsica, where in the early 1990's, Sicilian developers had already paid the first portion -- in cash -- of $2.5 million demanded by Mr. Santoni's group. The front attacked anyway, first lobbing grenades at a cluster of villas, then blowing up a construction site of 70 apartments.</p>
        <p>Finally, the group discovered that the buildings did not matter. The real stake was control over the island's yacht port and private air strip, the book said, because Cavallo was a transit point for drugs.</p>
        <p>With so much money sloshing around the rebel movement, funds were often unaccounted for and went astray. The authors cite examples of militants, charged with buying guns, who instead resold the weapons and pocketed the funds.</p>
        <p>In the end, they suggest, Corsica's nationalist movement was perhaps most undermined by infighting over ideology, tactics, weapons and money. Internal warfare became so nasty that at times, nationalists murdered nationalists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santoni was himself wounded twice in two separate assassination attempts. Since his co-author's death, he takes extra precautions. He will make an appointment only at home, in his mountaintop village. Three men are with him as a visitor arrives. They wait outside.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santoni, who once commanded perhaps 100 men, plenty of dynamite and an arsenal of weapons, said he is changed by his friend's death. ''Jean-Michel Rossi was my inspiration,'' he said. ''For me, politics is now finished. I've still not absorbed the fact that I won't see him again.''</p>
        <p>Why did he and Mr. Rossi write the book? They wanted to set the record straight, he replied, dispel a lot of ''mythmaking'' about Corsica and stop the finger pointing, the evasion of responsibility. ''Many of us were in the nationalist movement at one time or other, directly or indirectly maybe as much as one quarter of the population,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He has already served two jail sentences and, with an appeal pending, he may have to return to prison. But he does not regret his 20 years as a militant, he said. There have been some gains: Corsica now has a university, its language -- a dialect of Italian -- can be learned in school.</p>
        <p>''We stopped indiscriminate tourist development,'' he said. ''But we have failed in a social sense. We had dreams of ending poverty and unemployment, we dreamt of socialism, of Israeli-type kibbutzes.''</p>
        <p>Today, eight armed groups claim to speak or fight for the Corsican nationalist cause. ''The clandestine movement has become too fractured, too degenerated, it has to end,'' Mr. Santoni added. ''An armed fight against the French state is a fantasy. We're not colonized or oppressed by France.''</p>
        <p>Oddly, the old warrior even argues that France should move more slowly in offering the island a measure of self-rule by 2004. ''That is too soon,'' he said. ''People here are too corruptible.''</p>
