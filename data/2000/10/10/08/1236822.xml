        <p>Lady Warbones now felt herself much restored, having partaken of a goodly dollop of Drumsnab's Patented Extract of Whey, the elixir favored by 10 Crowned Heads and a Nabob for curing headache, the fantods and flutteriness of the humours.

        <p>''Oh no, my dear,'' expostulated Lady Warbones. ''Tell Cook only Huckstep's 'Pride of the Fleet' Hungarian Mustard, ground from hand-flailed seeds and twice boiled. To serve one's guests an inferior mustard would prompt insult not soon to be forgotten!''</p>

        <p>Lady Warbones now felt herself much restored, having partaken of a goodly dollop of Drumsnab's Patented Extract of Whey, the elixir favored by 10 Crowned Heads and a Nabob for curing headache, the fantods and flutteriness of the humours. Lord Fleagle would appear at any moment -- should his new ''Glad Miles'' barouche, built by Hobstone &amp; Bros., traverse the distance from Mealy House to her front door without incident, and, as Hobstone &amp; Bros. All-English barouches were the only choice of the gentry, one could, on this matter at least, be quite delivered of fears. Young Phoebe now dispatched Lady Warbones's reverie. ''Ma'am, will Cook be using the everyday mustard for the Mutton Surprise?'' inquired the scullery maid, red of proboscis and sniffling. The silly girl could use a spoonful of Dr. Jolly's Arabian Crystal Vapors!</p>
        <p>''Oh no, my dear,'' expostulated Lady Warbones. ''Tell Cook only Huckstep's 'Pride of the Fleet' Hungarian Mustard, ground from hand-flailed seeds and twice boiled. To serve one's guests an inferior mustard would prompt insult not soon to be forgotten!''</p>
        <p>Mordant Hall lay still in the long, soft afternoon, save for the hourly chime of the great vestibule clock, a most artfully decorated piece bought of Messrs. Hibble of Mudlark Street in the City and vouchsafed to have been made in Dresden by Klutzfrick himself, who, to his best knowledge, had never been undersold. It was all very well to muse upon timepieces and mustards, reflected Lady Warbones; but she must needs now attend to that which had pressed on her mind with an urgency since the surprising arrival, the day previous, of the letter from Houndsditch. Truly, marveled Lady Warbones, His Majesty's Postal Service was the Wonder of the Age! She must remember to write to Lord Flabstone, Franker of the King's Stamps, with her compliments. To receive a letter from Houndsditch, within a fortnight!</p>
        <p>Yet that there abraded in Lady Warbones's mind an itch, the phantom of a thought, half in and half out of her brain, could not be gainsaid. Rehang the Gainsborough? Attend to the lamp wicks in the dining hall? Such vexations more often visited her, now that she was no longer the young mistress of Mordant Hall, all abustle and renowned for her Daguerreotype memory.</p>
        <p>Aha! Of course! Her pug dogs! They awaited, nay, chafed, for their midday meal! And they must have Pipford's Select Nonesuch Mush in their bowls or nothing, for this monarch of canine dainties warranted a long and happy life for these dear dumb creatures, a life sans worms or mange, and for these reasons did Lady Warbones swear by it. The Talking Hound of Cornwall -- had he not credited his very powers of speech to Pipford's?</p>
        <p>It was then that Spivey, the butler, announced the presence at the door of a stranger.</p>
        <p>He was a dark stranger, thought Lady Warbones, perhaps half Moor and one-quarter Black Irish, and his mode of dress was that of a gentleman of the county, 40 years before. His clay-dappled riding boots cried for a brisk scrub with Old Smiler's Scotch Dubbin, ''for that Sheep-Fat Shine.'' He presented no carte de visite and gave no name, but stood surveying his surroundings for all the world as if he were not a visitor but master of Mordant Hall. A dyspeptic countenance completed the picture; Lady Warbones, ever kindly disposed toward her fellow man and well loved in the village for it, briefly considered sending for a vial of Blake's ''Ty-Phoon'' Intestinal Pacific, recommended by four sea captains out of every five for its quelling of electricity in the vital organs.</p>
        <p>No, she resolved. A guest must never be offered a tonic before having been invited to sit down, and as regards tendering such an invitation, Lady Warbones was of two conflicting minds.</p>
        <p>''Sir,'' she at length spoke, ''we are not yet introduced, but I can divine from your aspect a desire for swift resolution of whatever matter has brought you here, and can say that such dispatch in every way accords with my own sentiments on the issue. If you would but state your business.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Miss Lucy Sweetface could only by the most assiduous concentrative effort wiggle her pretty little foot into her shoe. 'Tis the last time, she remonstrated with herself, that I shall have a pair of tea shoes made by a cross-eyed village cobbler! To Messrs. Snaps &amp; Brummagem in the High Street I must fly; they have shod a million silly gooses such as I in perfect comfort, whilst Dame Fashion gazes approvingly down upon their handiwork. And no prior appointment is needed!</p>
        <p>Yet how could either Lady Warbones, or Miss Lucy Sweetface, or the stranger in the hall, begin to apprehend that dim roiling in the western sky, even now beginning to hush the birdsong in the brambles, and which presaged a turn of Fate that, had they but gained forewarning, might have rendered less the pitiful sorrows soon to befall them? With a Chuckles Sons Ltd. Ever-Faithful Marine &amp; Natural Barometric Wall Trumpet, of course, the new scientific phenomenon, which can anticipate Nature's meteorological whimsies and sound the alarm. Obtained of reputable horologists everywhere; and now, owing to a special arrangement by the manufactory, whose leasehold has expired and whose inventory is overstocked, bought cheap.</p>
