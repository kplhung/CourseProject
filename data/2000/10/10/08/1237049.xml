        <p>One candidate is prone to getting lost in his own syntactical swamps, and staring into the camera as if someone just shut off the teleprompter. The other is a policy wonk, a sometimes evasive career politician, who runs the risk of coming across like a one-note scold.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush and Al Gore? Try Jon S. Corzine and Bob Franks.</p>
        <p>Debate season is here, and anyone who didn't get enough oversold, overhyped reality-TV drama from the Olympics can tune in almost any night to one showdown or another between the contenders for that other quadrennial prize.</p>
        <p>As if last Tuesday's 90-minute, marathon microphone hogfest between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore weren't enough, or Thursday night's tete-a-tete between Dick Cheney and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the vice presidential nominees, the state's Senate candidates are facing off this Sunday morning. Stop them before they kill again? Or bore you to death? Too late, they'll debate again on Thursday.</p>
        <p>No, not Hillary Rodham Clinton  and Rick Lazio. Well, yes, they're debating 10:30 a.m. Sunday.</p>
        <p>But there is a New Jersey Senate race, too, after all. And at 11:30, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Franks, the candidates for United States Senate, will make their first joint televised appearance in a debate sponsored by The Star-Ledger and carried on Cablevision's News 12 and Comcast's CN 8.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Franks, there are big stakes in this first debate. He trails Mr. Corzine by 14 percentage points, according to two recent independent polls. He remains short of cash and essentially written off, thus far, by Republicans in Washington.</p>
        <p>What's more, he has been under attack by Mr. Corzine for weeks, accused on television of trying to dismantle the government and on the radio of being ''dangerous to New Jersey's health.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks tried to shake the money tree this week by spending $250,000 for a week's worth of his own TV ads in Philadelphia, citing numerous newspaper editorials critical of Mr. Corzine for his limited financial disclosures. Whether the ad helps Mr. Franks enough should become clear quickly, when his TV campaign either fades away or is ratcheted up to a full-scale air assault in the New York market as well. Any bets?</p>
        <p>In the debate, Mr. Frank needs to do two things, said David P. Rebovich, a political scientist at Rider University: Get across a reason for people to vote for him, and land some forceful criticisms of Mr. Corzine -- ''hopefully powerful enough from his perspective to cause late-deciding voters to not support what looks to be the Democratic juggernaut in this state,'' Mr. Rebovich said.</p>
        <p>The more difficult challenge for Mr. Franks is to trip up Mr. Corzine enough to hurt him so badly that the newspapers and TV news will pay attention, without coming across as a brute himself.</p>
        <p>''He's got to put Corzine on the spot in as inoffensive a way as possible,'' said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers who specializes in the Senate. ''It's a hard thing to bring off. He has to demonstrate that Corzine is just not up to the job. But he has to appear to be the master of the situation without appearing overbearing.''</p>
        <p>Another Republican Senate candidate tried something like that recently and failed miserably -- albeit against a woman well-versed in victimhood.</p>
        <p>''Certainly Bob's going to look to expose some of Corzine's flip-flops, and his out-of-touch positions,'' said one Republican involved in Mr. Franks's debate preparations. ''But we're not going to Lazio anyone here.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Corzine, ''the key is to stay on his message,'' Mr. Rebovich said. '' 'I'm for all these good things, and I'm going to go down and fight for New Jersey's values.' That means anything to anybody, it sounds populist in nature, and really takes the edge off any concerns people have about his money. He sounds like that eccentric country squire who's spending his own money and just wants to go do some good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rebovich compared Mr. Corzine to Governor Bush, saying both lacked the ability to explain their policy positions in detail. ''With both, we're voting for kind of an image and a promise,'' he said. ''The assumption we make about Corzine is the same -- he doesn't know much, but he'll find good people to work for him.''</p>
        <p>But will anyone be watching -- at least, anyone likely to be swayed by what happens in the debate?</p>
        <p>Cliff Zukin, director of The Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll, said that if as many as 200,000 people watched the debate live or during one of the rebroadcasts on cable TV on Sunday night, ''that's 6 percent. And they're the 6 percent who are already committed.''</p>
        <p>What about debate fatigue? Not a factor, Mr. Zukin said. ''We're talking about only 6 percent. You can find 6 percent of sports fans that keep on watching football game after football game on weekends.</p>
        <p>''Of course, the production values are much higher on football,'' he continued, warming to the idea. ''They've got lines showing you how far they've got to go to get a first down. They have helmet cams for the officials.</p>
        <p>''Maybe if the candidates could shoot paintballs or something,'' he said. ''Or if there were three times in the course of a debate where you could interrupt your opponent, like with instant replay.''</p>
