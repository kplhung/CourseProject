        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Informed readers must have blinked in disbelief at Caleb Carr's gross characterization of New York City's Dutch founders, in his review of Gerard T. Koeppel's ''Water for Gotham'' (Sept. 10), as drunkards who established ''an abysmal pattern for the city's future.'' Can these be the same Dutch as those who introduced notions of religious and ethnic toleration as well as civic and economic inclusiveness that were far ahead of their time? New York's early Dutch settlers deserve better than the scorn of folklorists like Carr.</p>
