        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The building of the American transcontinental railroad was to be sure an impressive accomplishment, but Henry Kisor's remark, in his review of Stephen E. Ambrose's ''Nothing Like It in the World'' (Sept. 17), that it ranks with the building of the Great Wall of China makes it clear to me that his experience of China is probably limited to chop suey and fortune cookies. To compare putting down two steel rails and a succession of firewood-sized wooden ties for 2,000 miles over land to a large extent as flat as a boccie ball court with the construction of the 30-foot-high, 1,500-mile-long Great Wall is like comparing a house made of matchsticks with Manderley, especially when one considers that the wall was built more than two millenniums before the railroad, at a time when the methods of doing such a thing were infinitely more primitive.</p>
        <p>You can't, I'm willing to bet, see those railroad tracks from outer space. It's interesting to note, too, that the railroad was largely built by Chinese.</p>
