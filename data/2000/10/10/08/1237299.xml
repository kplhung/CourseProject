        <p>The old quarterback, the 28-year-old from the defending national champions, was supposed to lead his team 48 yards in the final minutes and throw a game-winning touchdown pass.

        <p>The old quarterback, the 28-year-old from the defending national champions, was supposed to lead his team 48 yards in the final minutes and throw a game-winning touchdown pass. Florida State's Chris Weinke, bum ankle and all, did just that. Or at least it looked that way when he drilled a 29-yard pass to Atrews Bell with 1 minute 37 seconds left in the game to put the top-ranked Seminoles ahead of Miami for the first time today, 24-20.</p>
        <p>But the young quarterback on the other team, the 19-year-old, was not done. Ken Dorsey thought he had plenty of time to go 68 yards and win the game. ''I thought it would be easy,'' he said. He made it look that way. Dorsey had hit 5 of 6 passes for 60 yards when his tight end Jeremy Shockey said in the huddle that he was going to be open. The Hurricanes were on the 13-yard line, with a little under a minute left, and Dorsey took his word for it, delivering a rocket that knocked Shockey into the end zone.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of funny because every time he comes back he says he was open,'' Dorsey said. ''This time I listened to him.''</p>
        <p>But Miami left Weinke, who had led two touchdown drives in the preceding 2 minutes 46 seconds, time to try to win the game again.  After four complete passes, he had the Seminoles on the Miami 32. Matt Munyon, a walk-on, lined up for a 49-yard field goal to tie the score on the final play.</p>
        <p>The 80,905 at the Orange Bowl roared. The kick went wide right, just as two Florida State kicks had in 1991 and 1992 in a time when this rivalry meant something. Now it did again: No. 7 Miami 27, No. 1 Florida State 24.</p>
        <p>''The angle I had looked like it could have been good,'' Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said. ''Wouldn't you know it? He's been wide left all year, and then that happens. We had him out there pretty far, though.''</p>
        <p>But Bowden knew he could not blame his kicker. Miami had manhandled his team -- especially inside the 20, where the Seminoles ventured five times but came out with only 3 points. Twice inside the 20, Florida State failed to get short yardage on fourth down, once on the 2 Weinke threw an interception and once when Munyon missed a 22-yard field goal attempt. It was hardly a performance worthy of the defending national champions, who had beaten the Hurricanes the past five years by an average of 22.2 points.</p>
        <p>The Seminoles (5-1) knew they were in trouble when they went into halftime down by 17-0 and without points for the first time in 151 games dating to 1988. They failed to turn a fumble recovery on the opening kickoff into points when the backup quarterback Marcus Outzen was stopped on a sneak on fourth-and-1 at Miami's 16. Then on the final play of the half on the Miami 2, Hurricane linebacker Dan Morgan intercepted Weinke's pass.</p>
        <p>''The difference was Miami's ability to score in the red zone,'' Bowden said. ''We were horrific there.''</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes (4-1), meanwhile, did what no other team could do to Florida State this season. They ran, gaining 131 yards on a team that had given up only 56.6 yards a game. The Miami offensive line was superb all day -- especially tackles Joaquin Gonzalez and Bryant McKinnie -- and did not allow a sack even as Dorsey was throwing 42 times, completing 27 for a career-high 328 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>''We moved the ball offensively with our ground game,'' said Miami Coach Butch Davis, who beat the Seminoles for the first time in six tries as a head coach. ''Against Florida State you can't be one-dimensional. The key to our offense was the great play of our line. They were monstrous.''</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes' defense gave up 565 yards but always managed to stiffen when Florida State was in scoring position. Weinke, who looked awkward with a heavily bandaged sprained left ankle that had kept him from practice most of the week, managed to complete 29 of 58 passes for 496 yards and 3 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>Miami linebacker Dan Morgan tormented Florida State with 15 tackles, a forced fumble, an interception and a pass defense. Like his fellow senior Santana Moss (7 receptions for 115 yards), Morgan had been humiliated by the Seminoles the past three years as Miami tried to rebuild from National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions that sliced 31 scholarships from the program. Three years ago in Tallahassee, Florida State handed Miami a 47-0 drubbing.</p>
        <p>''It was a devastating loss for this program,'' Morgan said. ''It's been on my mind ever since. This was a sweet victory.''</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes had been pointing to this game since last summer as the national showcase to demonstrate they had returned to the form that helped them capture four national titles in the 1980's and early 1990's and had cost Florida State outright titles on three occasions. They probably did it again today, as well as resurrected their prospects, though Dorsey said he did not remember much about those classic clashes.</p>
        <p>In fact, Dorsey, a sophomore, could barely remember how he performed this afternoon and was eager to review the videotape. ''It's all kind of a bungle of plays,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Except one, the final touchdown pass.</p>
        <p>''I figured they were going to jump our receivers and challenge our tight ends to beat them,'' he said. ''They jumped Santana and left Shockey wide open. I got it there.''</p>
