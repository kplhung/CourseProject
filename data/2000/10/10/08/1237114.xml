        <p>Barney, the 80-pound black-and-tan coon hound who lives on Tier Street on City Island, was a nervous wreck the other day. The bombs were going off again at Rodman's Neck, the police firing range across the water. Through the year, almost 41,000 officers, 216 a day, trek to the range to unload rounds from their handguns, punctuated by shotgun blasts, cracks from assault rifles and the baroque outbursts of the bomb squad detonating all the dangerous stuff found around the city.</p>
        <p>But for the first time in years, another noise, a quiet but persistent shuffling and tapping, underscored the artillery rhythms. It was the music of building. The first New York Police Department noise-muffling shed is going up at Firing Range D, one of six ranges at Rodman's Neck.</p>
        <p>It took a promise to the state seven years ago, a lawsuit from Assemblyman Stephen Kaufman four years ago, and a protest in the driving rain on a raw fall day. By December, the first shed will be here.</p>
        <p>Deputy Inspector Steven Silks, the strapping, square-jawed man who runs the place, sized up the construction on a recent afternoon.</p>
        <p>''We're not putting a Band-aid on a gaping wound,'' he said. ''This is a big commitment. Nothing is going to eliminate the noise completely. They will build it, and we will come and test its effectiveness.''</p>
        <p>If the shed works, department officials say, more will be built. The total cost will be over $6 million.</p>
        <p>Now the naked wood looks like an imperfect movie set. Empty doorways open onto the empty field that is the range, which fades to the water's edge.</p>
        <p>This is where, depending on the wind, the roar of ordnance skips across the drifting sloops like a stone, and lands right around Peter La Scala's Victorian doorstep, where it cracks his windows. Or onto Marion Rosenfeld's porch, splashed by brine so long that the wood is almost burgundy, where the sound prompts friends on the telephone to ask if she is popping popcorn, and scares her dog, Barney.</p>
        <p>Years of wall-shaking rumbles have given the people in the idiosyncratic houses on City Island a flair for the dramatic war simile. It's like living in Hiroshima, they say, or in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>They remain unimpressed by the Police Department's building project. Most residents think the range should go into an enclosed hangar, or move elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''Abatement of the rifle range isn't going to do anything about the explosions,'' said Ms. Rosenfeld. ''If I had wanted to live in Beirut, I would have.''</p>
