        <p>SIZING up her quarry, a feathered corsage displayed on a counter of Bergdorf Goodman's main floor, Geena Davis circled, then swooped. ''This is flamboyant, all right,'' she said, plucking the piece off its perch and trying it on with a grin. She moved on, then, to a plumed headdress -- a tame variation on the avian headgear Busby Berkeley dancers used to wear.</p>
        <p>''Wear this, and people will think you've lost your mind,'' Ms. Davis trilled, clearly tempted to try it on just the same. It wouldn't be the first time she had risked scandalizing her public by putting on something outrageous. Just last month, Ms. Davis, famous for her rangy frame, pillowy lips and piano keyboard smile, created a tempest by turning up at the Emmy Awards in a Pamela Dennis dress so sheer she might just as well have worn nothing at all.</p>
        <p>Recalling the furor, she grinned again, this time more fixedly. ''Of course I knew that dress was sheer,'' she insisted. ''I had looked right at it in the mirror. It showed exactly as much as I wanted to show.''</p>
        <p>''Besides,'' she added lightly, ''life is about expressing yourself. I definitely like to push the envelope and not let anyone dictate to me how I should look.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, Ms. Davis has drawn attention for wearing over-the-top confections for the cameras. During one of her more infamous public appearances, at the Oscars in 1992, she turned up in a bustled gown hiked absurdly high in the front and trailing a banner of fabric at the rear. Her outfit met with predictable clucks of disapproval, but Ms. Davis claims she was unfazed. ''That gown fit my concept of dressing up for evening: you should go all out, make an effort,'' she said. ''I don't care what other people think.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Davis's taste for exuberantly outrageous fashion could be called calculatedly risque. She may look like a cartoon bombshell who walked straight out of a Roy Lichtenstein canvas. But as she has frequently reminded reporters, she is also a member of Mensa, smart enough, thank you, to consciously dress to make waves.</p>
        <p>During a cyclone shopping spree at Bergdorf's last Monday afternoon, however, her clothing decisions were tamer. She was scouting clothes for her latest character, Teddie Cochran, the hyperglamorous Manhattan career-woman-turned-instant-wife-and-mom, whom Ms. Davis portrays in her new television sitcom, ''The Geena Davis Show.''</p>
        <p>On the show, which has its premiere Tuesday on ABC, Teddie dresses with a breezy elegance that Ms. Davis can only aspire to. ''She makes a good buck and wears really cool clothes all the time,'' the actress said wistfully. Clearly smitten with the part, she turned up at Bergdorf's in full Teddie regalia: a commanding black wool jacket, slinky shirt, and low-slung but elegant brown leather pants.</p>
        <p>It was a new kind of packaging for Ms. Davis, 43, who, though she might protest, seems to be feeling a need to temper her trademark raciness with clothes that are streamlined and authoritative. ''I think my taste is becoming more refined, and defined, through Teddie,'' she said. ''I'm more sleek than in the past.''</p>
        <p>And a good deal more acquisitive. Ms. Davis swears that in real life she is a homebody, who can scarcely be coaxed out of her pajamas, even to go on the set. ''I'm not much of a shopper -- I really don't care about going to stores,'' she claimed. But as Teddie, Ms. Davis stalks the sales floor with an unconcealed avidity.</p>
        <p>''Let's go,'' she demanded the other day, blazing through designer shoes. Her eyes settling on a pair of hourglass-contoured ostrich-skin boots, she checked their heels. ''One great thing about this show -- I don't have to worry about shoe height,'' she said. An improbably lanky 6-foot-2, she has in the past towered over some co-stars. But in this show, she is evenly matched with Peter Horton, a former star of ''Thirtysomething,'' who plays her husband.</p>
        <p>Her character, who works in a nonprofit company that mates celebrities with suitably hip political causes, can get away with being a bit louche. ''I really would like to find some over-the-knee boots; Teddie's been wearing a lot of really short skirts,'' Ms. Davis sighed.</p>
        <p>On the show, Ms. Davis is as resilient as a cat. She plays a working mom trying to win over her adoptive kids and her skeptical housekeeper. But her tries at baking a cake and arranging play dates inevitably end in disaster. She bounces back each time with a slightly pained smile and a toss of her mane. Off-screen, too, she has had a lot of lives.</p>
        <p>After she won an Oscar as best supporting actress in ''The Accidental Tourist'' in 1988, and made a splash in ''Thelma and Louise'' in 1991, her career floundered. Working with her husband, the Finnish director Renny Harlin, she made two unremarkable action pictures in the mid-1990's. The marriage, her third,  ended in divorce, and she dropped out of sight for two years.</p>
        <p>She sprang back last year with ''Stuart Little,'' which unexpectedly pumped some helium into her career. In it, Ms. Davis, who had been accustomed to playing loopy, sometimes dangerous glamour girls, was the doting mother to a field mouse. Throughout the filming, however, she insisted on taking the drabness out of her character.</p>
        <p>''I knew I was playing a stay-at-home mom, but privately I was telling myself that she had a career on the side,'' Ms. Davis recalled the other day. ''In my mind, Mrs. Little worked as a music teacher or at a really good auction house. She wore beautifully tailored suits with a sort of 1940's flavor.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Davis feels a special affinity for the fashions of the 40's, and more than that, those of the 70's, her high school years. At Bergdorf's, she gazes lustfully at a display of Marc Jacobs handbags trimmed in silver hardware. ''I once had one like it,'' she said. ''I wish I had kept everything from the 70's.''</p>
        <p>It was in high school in a suburb of Boston that Ms. Davis first cultivated her willfully brazen persona, one that was built from the outside in on a ribald foundation of hot pants, maxi coats and floor-length vests. ''I would wear these things to class,'' Ms. Davis recalled.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davis still has a pretty fair idea of what flatters her. Fastening the clasp of an Erickson Beamon gold mesh necklace, she checked the mirror and studied her image dispassionately. ''I know what this thing needs,'' she said, opening her silk shirt clear down to the sternum, the better to show off the necklace.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to find a long skirt to wear with my boots,'' she said then, and headed toward the Giorgio Armani alcove on the second floor. She tried on and cast off, in succession, a satin skirt, which she dismissed as too dressy, and a jersey version that was languid but not tight enough to conform to her ideal. The skirt had to be slinky with a slit, she decided. Why the slit? She stared, implying the answer ought to be as plain as the mole on her cheek, before replying patiently, ''It's sexier that way.''</p>
