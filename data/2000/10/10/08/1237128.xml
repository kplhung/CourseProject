        <p>One day in 1968, state landscape architects stood on the banks of the Harlem River, then blighted by abandoned industry, and imagined River Park Towers. They dreamed of a place where renters could walk up gently sloping green lawns to the doors of modern high-rises.</p>
        <p>Like many grand plans, the towers, a Mitchell-Lama project that went up in 1974 inside Roberto Clemente State Park, now offer a view of some ruined future. Though conditions were never what was envisioned, they have recently become worse. Residents cannot stroll the waterfront, because of fears that diapers, glass bottles and home appliances flying from the screenless windows will strike them. The shots this summer were the last straw.</p>

        <p>One day in 1968, state landscape architects stood on the banks of the Harlem River, then blighted by abandoned industry, and imagined River Park Towers. They dreamed of a place where renters could walk up gently sloping green lawns to the doors of modern high-rises.</p>
        <p>Like many grand plans, the towers, a Mitchell-Lama project that went up in 1974 inside Roberto Clemente State Park, now offer a view of some ruined future. Though conditions were never what was envisioned, they have recently become worse. Residents cannot stroll the waterfront, because of fears that diapers, glass bottles and home appliances flying from the screenless windows will strike them. The shots this summer were the last straw.</p>
        <p>''Three months ago, shooting started erupting, and it got earlier and earlier and earlier, at 9 in the morning, 5 in the afternoon, 8 at night,'' said Andre Tolentino, manager of the project's C-Town supermarket. ''Once I was leaving the store and got caught in a shootout and had to jet out of here quick.''</p>
        <p>Angered by the gunfire and years of neglect, nearly 300 tenants of the buildings swelled a recent public meeting and told horrific tales of fires, floods, bullets whizzing through the air, dog feces in the stairwells, rats roaming the plaza with the drug dealers and recruiting gang members, leaking interiors and nonexistent security. There are nearly 200 vacancies in 1,654 apartments, and tenants say the management company for the complex, Ry Management,  has been unresponsive to their concerns.</p>
        <p>But a few things are looking up. A police officer now patrols on foot. A cleaning crew clears the back grounds three times a week. Ry is replacing cracked bricks, has promised action on maintenance and vacancies, and says new security officers will arrive in November. The Parks Council, a nonprofit group, and the state are planning new plantings to improve the promenade. But the place has a long way to go.</p>
        <p>''When I first came here, the floors shone like glass,'' said Leon Johnson, 61, a retired man who arrived in 1981. ''The walls were spotless. The colors in the lobby floor really used to come out. It had draperies and benches. All that disappeared. If the place was like this, I wouldn't be here.''</p>
