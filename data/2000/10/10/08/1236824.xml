        <p>Sunny Randall has some identity issues. Although she's not the wuss she was when Robert B. Parker introduced her in ''Family Honor,'' the newly minted Boston private eye has yet to develop a voice, let alone a personality, of her own. There are moments in PERISH TWICE (Putnam, $23.95), notably in polite but guarded conversation with pimps, hookers and hard guys, when she sounds just like Spenser. (''It's what I do,'' she tells a gangster who admires her style. ''I try to find out stuff. I like the work.'') The Spenserian air of amused detachment is hardly suitable, though, for this story about an assortment of women having emotional breakdowns because of troubled relationships, and when Sunny tries to be her own woman, she either freezes up or goes to pieces.</p>
        <p>Sunny is competent enough when she's getting the goods on her sister's cheating husband or tracking the male stalker of ''an avowed and public lesbian.'' And when things get hot and her politically prominent client tosses her off the stalking case, she has the connections to run her own private investigation. But the aloofness that passes for independence in Sunny's dealings with men puts a chill in her relationships with women. When her best friend, who is about to have an abortion, anxiously asks, ''Do you think this is right?'' and Sunny replies, ''For you? Not for me to say,'' you want to know who she thinks she is -- a guy?</p>

        <p>Outside of a Double Crostic in The Times Literary Supplement of London, where would you find cross-references to Roman baths and medieval abbeys, the poems of Milton and the watercolors of Blake, Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' and Queen's ''Another One Bites the Dust,'' if not in a Peter Lovesey mystery? And wittily woven together they are, too, in THE VAULT (Soho, $23), which relies on Peter Diamond, a British copper of eclectic cultural tastes, to unravel the complexities of a story that begins when a human hand is disinterred from a burial vault beneath the now-vanished house in Bath where Mary Shelley finished the classic horror story she famously started on a dark and stormy night at Lake Geneva.</p>
        <p>Truth to tell, the fate of the hand and its hapless owner isn't as interesting as the intrigues raised when an American professor who has done his literary research on ''Frankenstein'' crosses paths with a shifty antiques dealer, a savvy book dealer, a slippery puppeteer and other deftly drawn locals eager to make a buck off his scholarship. For his part in this clever farrago, the cantankerous Diamond lives up to his reputation for being ''obstinate'' and ''boorish'' but still ''capable of brilliance'' when presented with a literary mystery as exquisitely intricate as this one.</p>
        <p>Quick -- what's a five-letter adjective for someone who solves the crossword puzzle that Parnell Hall has thoughtfully tucked into his latest whodunit, LAST PUZZLE &amp; TESTAMENT (Bantam, $23.95)? ''Happy'' might work, because it's great fun trying to outwit the heirs of a cunning old woman whose eccentric will forces them to compete in a wordplay contest to inherit her fortune. The correct answer, though, is ''wrong,'' because once the heirs have found all the pieces and lined up all the clues (stepping over a body or two in the process), the real mystery has yet to be solved.</p>
        <p>Cora Felton is just the party to do it. Known to her fans as the Puzzle Lady, for the nationally syndicated crossword column that she pretends to write (but which is actually the work of her niece), Cora has the brazen charm of the older woman who has paid her dues and sees no further need to deny her appetite for vulgar fun. From her favorite bar stool at the Wicker Basket, Cora is perfectly placed to judge the cutthroat contest (for a princely fee, of course) and to observe the murderous passions that the promise of a few million dollars unleashes in her Connecticut neighbors. This new series isn't entirely free of whimsy, but Hall's wry humor keeps it mostly in check -- as does Cora, who is sure to show up in a flashy red dress, just in the nick of time to slosh her martini into your lap and blow her cigarette smoke in your eyes.</p>
        <p>STREET LEVEL (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Minotaur, $22.95) is one of those stories you don't believe for a minute. Bob Truluck's first novel (which won him an award from the Private Eye Writers of America) turns on the dumb premise that the thieves who stole a gay man's semen from a fertility clinic in St. Paul would impregnate a teenage girl, spirit her away to Orlando and blackmail the rich, desperate gay guy and his lover with illiterate demands for ''ahunded thosan dolars.'' Sillier still, the victim hires Duncan Sloan, a seedy Florida gumshoe with no obvious sleuthing skills but the filthy mouth and insulting manner picked up from the hard-boiled role models of outdated noir fiction, to find the girl before she gets an ''aborshun.'' But if you can't accuse Truluck of literary pretensions, neither can he be denied the remarkable immediacy of his stark portrait of Florida's dirt-poor social fringes. He may not be comfortable with rich gay men in fancy restaurants, but he really knows his way around a trailer park.</p>
        <p>Personally, I like more academics in my academic mysteries. But the rancorous trustees' meetings, budget-cutting sessions and other administrative face-offs that consume so much of Clare Munnings's first novel, OVERNIGHT FLOAT (Norton, $23.95), are probably more reflective of the realities of life in a small liberal arts women's college tucked away in the Vermont woods than learned classroom lectures on the Ancrene Riwle. True to this view, Munnings (a pseudonym of Jill Ker Conway and Elizabeth T. Kennan, former presidents of, respectively, Smith College and Mount Holyoke) traces all the troubles at Sanderson College, including the murder of the school treasurer, to fiscal hanky-panky. Luckily, the new chaplain, Rosemary Stubbs, comes to her job armed with the financial smarts to analyze the cooked books and blessed with the sweet, intelligent spirit to compose a nice memorial service while ministering to hysterical students and catching a killer.</p>
