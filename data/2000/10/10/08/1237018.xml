        <p>UNTIL she started dating Douglas Gibbon McAlinden seven years ago, Sarah Harfield Piel was a confirmed bookworm who could often be found in her room, reading while eating burned toast (she likes it charred).</p>
        <p>''Her favorite thing was to be quiet and involved in the world of books,'' said her sister, Katherine Harfield Piel. The Piels are a family of bookworms, although very talkative ones. Her father, Jonathan Bird Piel, is a former editor of Scientific American, and her grandfather, Gerard Piel, a longtime publisher.</p>
        <p>Her life became far less orderly when she started going out with Mr. McAlinden, an acquaintance since grade school. (She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan, he to the Collegiate School, and they have many friends in common.) For one thing, she had to shout to be heard by him. ''I'm 5 feet 2; he's 6 feet 4,'' said Ms. Piel, now 29 and a literary agent at Arthur Pine Associates in New York. ''When we met, I couldn't hear him and he couldn't hear me. We kept saying, 'What? What?' ''</p>
        <p>Friends describe Mr. McAlinden, also 29, as the antithesis of a bookworm or an introvert. He likes to greet friends (and sometimes strangers) with bear hugs. He is the chief financial officer of McAlinden Associates, a New York company, which his parents, Jack and Anne McAlinden, founded, and which runs communication-skills workshops.</p>
        <p>He gives a lot of dinner parties, friends say, but sometimes forgets to go shopping until the guests begin arriving. The meals are always served around midnight, after which he might suggest that everyone take a walk in Central Park to search for stars or even drive to Vermont to search for snow. ''He likes things to excess, wild and crazy,'' said Matthew Tynan, a friend and the son of the drama critic Kenneth Tynan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Piel said their early dates would sometimes last until dawn. ''I was really drawn to him because I'm a more cautious person and he's really adventuresome,'' she said. ''One time, he said, 'Come see this Off Broadway show, and afterward we'll go to Connecticut and visit friends.' The show didn't end until well after midnight and we arrived in Connecticut at 5 a.m. That's completely normal for him.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Piel is definitely no longer an armchair traveler. With Mr. McAlinden, she has traveled to the Galapagos Islands, Italy, Scotland, Greece and India. ''India certainly tried Sarah's ability to rough it,'' Mr. McAlinden said. ''It was up to 120 degrees outside. We were searching for shade everywhere. We would even stop in the shade of a cow on the street. We had these huge packs on, and Sarah was drenched with sweat and I thought she looked just beautiful. She never understood that, of course.''</p>
        <p>The couple bought an Upper West Side apartment together in 1996, an adventure of another sort. ''It was a handyman special,'' Ms. Piel said. ''There had been a ceiling fan that came crashing down on the floor. The first night we opened a bottle of Champagne and we sat around the broken fan like a campfire.''</p>
        <p>On Sept. 23, a misty, rainy day, they were married in Sagaponack, N.Y., at the Madoo Conservancy, a private garden that looks as if it were designed by Dr. Seuss and Martha Stewart. Little paths lead through pristine flower gardens, then around in circles through a small forest furnished with yellow and cobalt blue furniture.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, who is of Scottish descent, wore a kilt. Torches burned along the paths. And mist seemed to rise everywhere, as if from a moat.</p>
        <p>''It felt like Scotland, with the bagpipes and kilts and these misty skies and the torches,'' said Hilary Black, a guest.</p>
        <p>Katherine, the bride's sister, said the best thing about Mr. McAlinden is that he knows exactly how to cheer up Sarah.</p>
        <p>''Douglas is an amazing cook, but when my sister is sad he'll go into their kitchen and make burned toast for her,'' she said.</p>
