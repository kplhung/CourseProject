        <p>As violent clashes continued unabated today between Israelis and Palestinians, the anger that has churned across the Middle East since the violence began last week suggested that the polarization of Muslim opinion may have sharply reduced prospects for an overall peace settlement, even if the violence can be curbed.</p>
        <p>Not since the Oslo peace efforts began in 1993 has the region seen such widespread turmoil. The angry crowds that have marched in capitals like Baghdad and Tehran, hotbeds of hostility toward Israel, have been matched by protests in nations that have moved in recent years toward an acceptance of Israel's existence, including oil-rich monarchies in the Persian Gulf like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

        <p>As violent clashes continued unabated today between Israelis and Palestinians, the anger that has churned across the Middle East since the violence began last week suggested that the polarization of Muslim opinion may have sharply reduced prospects for an overall peace settlement, even if the violence can be curbed.</p>
        <p>Not since the Oslo peace efforts began in 1993 has the region seen such widespread turmoil. The angry crowds that have marched in capitals like Baghdad and Tehran, hotbeds of hostility toward Israel, have been matched by protests in nations that have moved in recent years toward an acceptance of Israel's existence, including oil-rich monarchies in the Persian Gulf like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
        <p>Arab countries that have signed peace agreements with Israel, or opened trade and diplomatic ties, have found themselves roiled by popular anger. In the Jordanian capital, Amman, troops opened fire on Palestinian refugees on Friday who were demanding the closure of the Israeli Embassy. An 18-year-old Palestinian  was killed, but the Jordanian authorities said today that he was the victim of a ''settling of accounts'' between rival Palestinian groups, not of police gunfire.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, King Abdullah II -- who met twice in August with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, urging both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute not to miss the chance of reaching a final peace accord -- visited a clinic in Amman to donate blood for Palestinian casualties of the violence. Jordan, like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and several other Arab nations, announced that its hospitals were available to treat any Palestinian wounded.</p>
        <p>An Arab businessman in Dubai placed a newspaper advertisement to announce plans to ship 50 truckloads of stones and 500,000 slingshots overland to Jordan for use by Palestinian protesters.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the Middle East, there have been scores of mass marches, campus protests and officially sponsored rallies. Crowds of 10,000 and more have gathered in Cairo, Baghdad, Beirut and Tehran, among other places. Governments that routinely ban protests have turned a blind eye. In the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Wednesday, 1,000 students pelted the American Embassy with stones, branches and bags of rubbish, and one man managed to haul down the American flag. At the American University in Cairo, also on Wednesday, students plucked the American flag from the main administration building and replaced it briefly with a black-and-white Palestinian kaffiyeh, or headscarf.</p>
        <p>One measure of the changed mood across the Arab world was Egypt's announcement on Friday that it would convene an emergency Arab summit meeting in Cairo on Oct. 21 and 22, and that the nations attending would include Iraq, which has not attended an Arab summit meeting since before the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Although President Saddam Hussein has not confirmed that he will lead the Iraqi delegation in person, Arab diplomats in Cairo said the decision to include Iraq marked a major shift, and reflected a wider momentum across the Arab world to break with the American-led drive to maintain Iraq's isolation.</p>
        <p>More broadly, the clashes that have killed more than 90 Palestinians appear to have crystallized a widespread disillusionment among Arab and Muslim nations with the  proposed peace settlement that the United States has pushed since the abortive Camp David summit meeting that President Clinton held in July.</p>
        <p>Arab leaders generally have viewed the proposals as weighted against the Palestinians, especially on the key issue of Jerusalem. Their reluctance to accept the proposals appears to have hardened, during the recent violence, into a resolve to oppose them more openly.</p>
        <p>The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, a force in Middle East diplomacy for nearly 20 years, today issued one of his starkest warnings yet this week, telling Egypt's army newspaper in an interview that the settlement being urged by Washington ''would be a time bomb that would explode in the faces of all.''</p>
        <p>In an interview on Egyptian state television on Friday, Mr. Mubarak  criticized Israel for what he called ''excessive force'' against ''unarmed'' Palestinians and called on the Jewish state to ''stop your provocations.'' He added: ''The Palestinians throw rocks, while you'' -- meaning the Israelis -- ''fire live bullets at them and even rockets from aircraft.'' He also criticized Prime Minister Barak for rejecting an international inquiry into the violence, saying, ''But Barak says 'no.' I do not understand: Israel wants to stand up against the whole world.''</p>
