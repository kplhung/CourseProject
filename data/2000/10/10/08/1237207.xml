        <p>A recent online survey adds a new wrinkle to the age-old question of who does what in a marriage.</p>
        <p>When it comes to house-hunting, married couples are deciding jointly which home to buy, the survey found. And couples said they generally were sharing the burden of researching and selecting a mortgage. But when it comes time to sign on the dotted line, they said, husbands step up three-quarters of the time to be the primary borrower.</p>
        <p>MortgageIT Inc., an online mortgage provider based in New York, informally polled more than 1,000 married people who were shopping for a mortgage loan online from June 1 to Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>The good news for couples is that the process of buying a home does not necessarily lead to arguments. Fifty-eight percent said they didn't quarrel over it, while  64 percent said obtaining a mortgage was stress-free or only slightly stressful.</p>
        <p>Doug Naidus, chief executive of MortgageIT, said the Internet had changed the way couples shop for a mortgage, helping them share the responsibility. Traditionally, he said, the wives selected the home, while the husbands dealt with the financial arrangements.</p>
