        <p>MY wife said I was being too pushy, too Type A, when I wanted our son, Jeremy, to try out for the traveling soccer team in second grade. I told her I could already see that our 8-year-old had talent in the sport.</p>
        <p>''But it will ruin our weekends,'' she said, fearing that Saturdays and Sundays would become a marathon of practices and games.</p>
        <p>After considerable debate, my wife relented and let Jeremy go to the tryouts, which were infelicitously scheduled during our daughter's 11th birthday party. Sure enough, Jeremy made the traveling team, the Pelham Cobras, and I am proud to say they were undefeated in their first season. That was three years ago, long before I had any notion that I would some day be drafted to coach a very different Cobras team.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of that first season, the team's parents began dreaming that our Cobras would grow into the best soccer team in all of Westchester, if not the state. Will, the right wing, could run like the wind, while Nico, the left wing, was a precocious dribbler and shooter, having learned at the feet of his Italian father. Sean, the center half, had a sixth sense enabling him to emerge from any scrum with the ball. And Jeremy, playing fullback, had a surprising knack for stealing the ball from opponents.</p>
        <p>The Cobras' first 10-week season came in the B division, and the following spring they were elevated to the tougher A division. There, our boys maintained a winning record the first season, but with each season the Cobras did worse. So much so that last spring was a disaster -- no victories, one tie and seven often lopsided losses.</p>
        <p>Part of it was that the Cobras had a hard time keeping up with teams from larger towns with larger gene pools, like Scarsdale. Part of it was that several Cobras began focusing on other sports, especially hockey. In addition, I was convinced that some boys started to care more about Britney Spears than about corner kicks and the give and go. (But wouldn't the teams we played have the same problem? my wife pointed out.)</p>
        <p>After last spring's debacle, only seven of the 18 team members signed up to play this fall in the league for 11-year-olds. Suddenly it looked as if our beloved Cobras were going to be no more. I was crestfallen. Why? Because I love soccer and because I thought my son and several others on the team had real talent that should be nurtured. I was saddened that some boys were deserting soccer for hockey and tackle football. Tackle for 11-year-olds -- what has the world come to, I thought.</p>
        <p>I always believed that Pelham could develop terrific soccer teams, but it seemed as if this smallish town of 14,000 was relegating its teams to mediocrity because everyone was encouraged to play everything -- football, baseball, basketball, hockey, tennis, golf, not to mention swimming and sailing. Here I'll plead guilty to a Big Brother attitude, but I often think the town fathers and mothers should encourage children to concentrate on a couple of sports (make sure one of them is soccer) rather than spread them too thin.</p>
        <p>With only seven players signed up, the Cobras were on the brink of dying, but several other parents and I decided to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. We worked the phones and persuaded seven new boys to join the team. The dedicated father who had coached for three years decided to step aside, and I was nudged, pushed and cajoled into being the Cobras' new coach, probably because I played varsity soccer in college and have a big mouth on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>At our first practice, I was no Vince Lombardi. I told the boys that my emphasis was going to be on having fun and learning soccer skills. I said, ''Hopefully this formula will bring us a few wins along the way.''</p>
        <p>After two weeks of practices, my pint-size gladiators headed off to their first game -- against the Bronx Strikers in Van Cortlandt Park. (After several undistinguished seasons, the Cobras have been demoted to the easier C division.)</p>
        <p>I had little idea what to expect, but from the opening whistle the Cobras outhustled the Bronx team. This newfound aggressiveness was a far cry from last spring when our players hustled less and less each game, growing increasingly dispirited by the team's downward slide.</p>
        <p>At the 15-minute mark, Alex, a new player, hammered in the first goal of the season. What a start! Ten minutes later, Greg, another new Cobra, adroitly blooped a ball over the goalie's outstretched hands. I don't know where Greg perfected that shot -- it certainly wasn't from my coaching. Our defense hung tough, and at the end of the game our goalie complained of boredom because so few balls came his way.</p>
        <p>The final score was 4 to 1. Several parents congratulated me for reviving the Cobras, but I said with total sincerity that the boys deserved all the congratulations. What made me happiest was that Jeremy, who seems to find fault in nearly everything I do, didn't have a single negative word about my coaching. What bigger victory could one ask for?</p>
