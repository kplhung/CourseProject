        <p>The city's Buildings Department has halted construction of a privately owned telecommunications tower in a residential neighborhood full of people who call it a blight and have long resented its presence.</p>
        <p>The department must decide whether Pinnacle Towers, a Florida-based company, completed substantial construction on the tower by Sept. 15. That deadline was given two years ago by the Board of Standards and Appeals when, over community objections, it approved a project to replace the tower with a larger one.</p>
        <p>The tower, at 140 Merrick Avenue, was built in 1967 by Frank Gunther, who rented space to commercial broadcasters for their antennas. The groups, claimed that the city should never have granted Mr. Gunther a zoning variance for the project.</p>
        <p>But the board rejected that argument in 1998. It also approved Mr. Gunther's plan to replace the original 90-foot tower with a 130-foot structure and to build a faux-lighthouse facade to hide the tower's equipment. Before the work was begun, Mr. Gunther sold the property to Pinnacle Towers, which adopted his plans.</p>
        <p>The company poured a foundation for the new tower shortly before the deadline but only after angering area residents by obtaining a variance from the Buildings Department to work for two weeks from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. and on weekends. Coalition members marched to the construction site while work was going on and staged an angry confrontation with the architect.</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a department spokesman, said the company would be allowed to complete the tower if substantial construction had taken place. Otherwise, it will have to ask the board for a deadline extension.</p>
        <p>Deanna Reiss, a lawyer and coalition member, said many residents were ready to testify against an extension at a board hearing.</p>
