        <p>Thirty years after we left New York for the suburbs, my wife and I have escaped back to Manhattan -- to an apartment a few blocks from where I lived when I first came to the city, in 1956. Of course, many things have changed. What hasn't is how I feel at 67: I'm a kid again, drinking in the city as if it were the first time. I have rediscovered Central Park, and it has never looked so beautiful.</p>
