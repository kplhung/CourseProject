        <p>You report that some criminologists are uneasy about requiring prisoners to wear stripes or other distinctive inmate garb, and you quote one who suggests that it humiliates prisoners and impinges on their dignity. You say this practice, along with chain gangs and boot camps, represents ''a return to a more punitive penal age.''</p>

        <p>Yet the criminal has betrayed his family and has broken the social code. Prisoners should be made to feel sorry for and ashamed of their crimes. According to the Judeo-Christian ethic, a sense of shame is a prerequisite to repentance and rehabilitation.</p>
