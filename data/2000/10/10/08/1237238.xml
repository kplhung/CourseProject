        <p>Only when he found a seat in the dugout last night did the Oakland rookie Barry Zito look much like a nervous playoff newcomer. Between innings he would wrap a towel around his neck and quickly nibble at his nails, inspect them, then nibble at them again, as if he could not nibble enough.</p>
        <p>He might have been the only person at Yankee Stadium biting his nails by the middle of the game. The Oakland Athletics clobbered the Yankees, 11-1, and an important reason was the calm pitching by Zito, a 22-year-old left-hander who made his major league debut in July.</p>
        <p>''I just tried to stay on my game -- calm and composed -- and not get caught up in what Yankee Stadium was all about,'' Zito said after the game, his hands jammed in his pockets.</p>
        <p>Zito will not make anyone forget about Don Larsen, but he was as effective as the Athletics needed him to be. What that means is that Zito was more effective than Roger Clemens, the 38-year-old legend who started for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''He was the key to the game,'' Oakland Manager Art Howe said of Zito. ''He went out and kept putting zeroes up.''</p>
        <p>Zito and Clemens lasted less than six innings, and Zito matched Clemens's five strikeouts, but the similarities ended there. Clemens gave up a three-run home run to the fourth hitter he faced and left the game to boos. Zito allowed his first and only run in the sixth inning after giving up a double to the last batter he faced. That was the only extra-base hit he allowed.</p>
        <p>Zito gave up seven hits and two walks in his five and two-thirds innings.</p>
        <p>''It was probably unfair to put that kind of pressure on the kid,'' Oakland's general manager, Billy Beane, said. ''But I think he was the second-best pitcher in the month of September in baseball.'' Oakland's Tim Hudson, Beane added, was the best.</p>
        <p>Even though this was only his 15th big league game, Zito seemed ready for this. He had pitched at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 8, getting no decision in Oakland's 4-3 loss, and he made sure to get his trip to Monument Park out of the way then. He knew Yankee Stadium was a hostile place.</p>
        <p>Zito has relatives who live in New York and, as he said Friday, ''They'll be the only four or five people out there rooting for me.''</p>
        <p>But all pitching mounds are basically the same, Zito said, and he planned to concentrate on that tiny part of the ballpark. Until the Yankees got to him in the sixth inning, he changed pitches well, blending looping curves with sneaky smoke. He told himself to trust himself, to trust his stuff.</p>
        <p>''That's basically been the M.O. of this whole team,'' Zito said. ''We try to stay calm and relaxed, and we're not going to get tight.''</p>
        <p>After Olmedo Saenz swatted a three-run homer in the first off Clemens, Zito got a double play and struck out Paul O'Neill in the bottom of the inning. No Yankee got past second base until the sixth inning, and Oakland had a six-run lead by then.</p>
        <p>''You give these guys a lead,'' Oakland right fielder Jeremy Giambi said of the Athletics' pitching staff, ''and they really can go after guys.''</p>
        <p>The home run was crucial for Zito. It allowed him to relax, to feel as if he had a comfort zone. He said he always pitches as if he has only a one-run lead, but he could afford to be more aggressive.</p>
        <p>''He was focused on the game,'' Saenz said. ''He kept doing his job.''</p>
        <p>Zito struck out David Justice and Glenallen Hill in the second inning. He struck out O'Neill and Bernie Williams in the fourth. He got Luis Sojo to ground out in the fifth after Derek Jeter had walked with two outs.</p>
        <p>Howe pulled Zito when the game was still in some doubt, but Jim Mecir got an out, and, with the help of two more relievers, the biggest victory in Zito's young career was safe.</p>
        <p>The Athletics had to go back to Oakland after last night's game, but now the Yankees are coming along.</p>
        <p>''I don't stick a number on my ability,'' Zito said. ''It's not like I'm saying: 'I'm 22. I can't pitch here.' '</p>
