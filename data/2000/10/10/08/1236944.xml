        <p>A 140-ACRE property atop a hill with views of parkland has gone on the market for $15 million. It is currently the Shrub Oak campus of Phoenix Academy, a substance abuse rehabilitation program for teenagers.</p>
        <p>The campus includes a five-story, 270,000-square-foot building, six houses used for staff residences and several other outbuildings. The main building, which houses dormitories, classrooms, offices and a bomb shelter, sits on a lawn surrounded by a stone wall in northern Westchester.</p>
        <p>''Finding this kind of property in Westchester is very, very rare,'' said Andrew J. Gerringer, senior vice president of Douglas Elliman, the company in Manhattan that, with Sally Siano &amp; Associates in Bedford Hills, is handling the sale. He added that Phoenix House, which bought the property for $3 million at an auction in 1983, wants to take advantage of the strong real estate market.</p>
        <p>The campus was built in 1954 as the site of Loyola Seminary, which was owned by the Jesuits. The property was later sold to a Bible college.</p>
        <p>The current sale has attracted not only academic institutions but also developers of corporate retreats, golf courses, health clubs, assisted living housing and homes.</p>
        <p>Houses in a nearby subdivision on Stony Street are selling for $700,000.</p>
        <p>''The amount of people who are interested in this property is just staggering; it's huge,'' said Steve Siano, the listing Bedford Hills real estate agent. ''I didn't even know there were this many developers.</p>
        <p>''Every day I get calls from them, not just from around here, but from New Jersey, Long Island, Queens -- one guy flew up from Florida. Some developers say they want to use the building; others want to knock it down. I've heard it all, except I'm waiting for heliports and polo fields.''</p>
        <p>Phoenix Academy currently has 50 staffers and about 250 students, ranging in age from 14 to 18. ''We, like other not-for-profits, have to constantly review the value of our assets to see if we can improve or expand our services,'' said Peter Kerr, a spokesman for Phoenix House.</p>
        <p>When Phoenix Academy first came to Shrub Oak, there was considerable antagonism toward the drug rehabilitation center. But the opposition subsided over time, and Phoenix House has been ''almost a silent neighbor,'' said Linda G. Cooper, the town supervisor of Yorktown, which includes Shrub Oak.</p>
        <p>''We would hope to have another similarly quiet institution,'' Ms. Cooper said. ''This is a very important piece of Yorktown. It is visible from the skyline all over. It's in the Lakeland School District. It's in a residential area, and it's surrounded by an awful lot of parkland.''</p>
        <p>Like many Northern Westchester districts, Lakeland is having problems with school crowding, and Ms. Cooper said she feared a residential development would overburden the schools. She added that Yorktown already had several facilities to house the elderly, including senior housing, assisted living and a residence for patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
