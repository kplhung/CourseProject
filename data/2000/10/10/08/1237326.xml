        <p>Forty-five minutes before last night's first pitch, there was a wall of fans in blue and white descending upon Yankee Stadium and hoping to witness a celebration. So many people flooded across River Avenue that it did not matter if the traffic light was green or red. Everyone kept walking. There was a game to get to and a potential clinching to watch, so the fans acted as if the light were constantly green.</p>
        <p>This was another critical October evening in the Bronx, a chance for the Yankees to subdue the Athletics, obliterate those questions about sleepwalking through September and then take a couple of days off.</p>
        <p>The path to a triumph in the division series included one more victory, and the path to the World Series looked appetizing, too. All the Yankees had to do was win behind Roger Clemens to avoid a Game 5. But during the postseason that is like asking television executives to schedule the starting times of games a week in advance.</p>
        <p>Clemens had a terrible first inning and made the mistake of allowing the fidgety A's to feel comfortable, and they soared to an 11-1 victory in Game 4 of the three-of-five-game division series. The Yankees have lost 3 of their last 23 postseason games, and Clemens, the starter in Game 1, has lost all three. Think about that. Twenty and zero without Roger. Oh and three with Roger.</p>
        <p>So now the Yankees will face a potential elimination game in October for the first time since they lost Game 5 to the Indians, 4-3, in the 1997 division series. Amazingly, since that defeat, Clemens is the only Yankee pitcher who has lost in the postseason. Because Clemens faltered and the Yankees were 0 for their first 8 at-bats with runners in scoring position against the 22-year-old Barry Zito, the Yankees slept on a charter plane last night.</p>
        <p>''It's something we have to do,'' Clemens said. ''It's not going to be easy. Nothing is easy right now.''</p>
        <p>Clemens was the last Yankee to trot onto the field last night and there was polite, not raucous, applause. Elton John's ''Rocket Man'' played as Clemens warmed up on a chilly night and the lyrics, ''I'm not the man they think I am at home,'' were an intriguing backdrop. Just who is Clemens? Clemens is a future Hall of Famer, but he is still trying to prove that he can win games in October and still trying to assert himself as a Yankee. Because Clemens did not, both pursuits might have to wait until next season.</p>
        <p>When you see Andy Pettitte or Orlando Hernandez, you see two pitchers who are Yankees. When you see Clemens, you see a pitcher who dominated with the Red Sox, who excelled for two seasons with the Blue Jays and who has been an enigma for the Yankees. Clemens had a chance to revise that while working on three days' rest for the first time since 1993, and he was bruised for six runs and six hits before leaving in the sixth, his eyes staring at his shoelaces.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I expect to win and succeed and get better each time out,'' Clemens had said. ''I set the bar pretty high. I don't know  you wouldn't. If I didn't, I feel I'm wasting my time around here.''</p>
        <p>Last night was a waste for the Yankees because they treated their season so carelessly. Some of the eager fans who cruised through red lights before the game were also grumbling as Clemens walked the leadoff hitter, Terrence Long, on four pitches. After a fielder's choice, Clemens walked Jason Giambi and seemed angry with the strike zone. He walked to the front of the mound, blew warm air into his right hand and stalked back to the rubber.</p>
        <p>The batter was Olmedo Saenz, a rookie who turns 30 today and who was 0 for 1 in his career off Clemens. Clemens did not want to walk the bases loaded, so he pumped an inside fastball to Saenz and he belted it over a yellow advertising sign in left field for a three-run blast. It was far too quiet in the Bronx for the first inning of a night that was supposed to be celebratory, and it grew far too ugly with only about 5,000 fans still watching the Yankees get destroyed in the ninth.</p>
        <p>Denny Neagle had warmed up twice by the third, which is all anyone needed to know about how Clemens started off. Saenz's homer gave the A's a 3-0 cushion and it relaxed Zito. Zito saw his teammates botch some plays in Game 3 and must have wondered if they would be tight again. Those fears disappeared when Clemens threw a fat pitch to Saenz.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre chose Clemens to start the opener, even though he had Hernandez, one of the premier postseason pitchers in the last three years. Torre felt that Clemens deserved Game 1 because he finished with 9 victories over his last 11 decisions, but one Yankee said: ''It surprised me. I would have used El Duque and then Pettitte.''</p>
        <p>Now the Yankees must rely on Pettitte, who traveled ahead of the team to Oakland yesterday, and who will work on three days' rest. When the Yankees lost to the Indians in the decisive game three years ago, their starter pitched on three days' rest, too. His name was Andy Pettitte.</p>
