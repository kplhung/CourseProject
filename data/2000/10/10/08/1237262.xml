        <p>Football fans are seeing more of Rick A. Lazio these days. Soap opera buffs can count on both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Lazio being part of the days of their lives for the duration of New York's Senate campaign. And anyone who watches news regularly will be at ground zero for the explosion of political advertising on television.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, it seems, these ads are everywhere. Well, not quite everywhere. The candidates are looking for older viewers of local news programs. They are hoping to persuade the young and the restless through ads on late-night comedy shows. So far, they are making little or no effort to reach the audiences for ''Dr. Laura,'' ''Friends,'' ''Ally McBeal'' or ''The X-Files.''</p>

        <p>Football fans are seeing more of Rick A. Lazio these days. Soap opera buffs can count on both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Lazio being part of the days of their lives for the duration of New York's Senate campaign. And anyone who watches news regularly will be at ground zero for the explosion of political advertising on television.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, it seems, these ads are everywhere. Well, not quite everywhere. The candidates are looking for older viewers of local news programs. They are hoping to persuade the young and the restless through ads on late-night comedy shows. So far, they are making little or no effort to reach the audiences for ''Dr. Laura,'' ''Friends,'' ''Ally McBeal'' or ''The X-Files.''</p>
        <p>The point of all this is to find, in the ocean of 6.6 million or so television households in the state, those islands of undecided voters who could make the difference.</p>
        <p>They do not always look in the same places. Mr. Lazio is seeking persuadable voters who watch Notre Dame football on television. He is also looking for them among viewers of ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' on NBC, ''Politically Incorrect'' on ABC and ''Mad TV'' on Fox. Mrs. Clinton is seeking out the relationship-challenged viewers of ''Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.'' Her campaign may have less ready cash than Mr. Lazio's, but it has shown expensive tastes, spending about $50,000 to book a 30-second spot on tonight's season premiere of ''The Practice,'' ABC's popular drama.</p>
        <p>Both campaigns are buying ads on daytime programs like ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and ''Judge Judy'' and early evening shows like ''Wheel of Fortune'' and ''Hollywood Squares.''</p>
        <p>All of this spending is plotted with exquisite care, by strategists who guard their plans more zealously than any coach guards his playbook. The decisions about where to put commercials are among the most important in any campaign because television advertising, in many ways, is the campaign, consuming at least half of a typical candidate's total spending.</p>
        <p>Thus, about half the take from campaign fund-raising ends up being logged neatly onto the flimsy paper receipts that are kept in the offices of every local television station and available for public viewing.</p>
        <p>Those public records show that, for $500, a campaign can usually buy the cheapest 30-second spot on the 5 a.m. local news in New York. Four times that amount gets the same message to the audience of ''Good Morning America.''</p>
        <p>But what you pay for is not always what you get. Both of those purchases are akin to buying a standby airplane ticket; the commercial can be bumped if the program is full of customers paying higher rates. To guarantee that a 30-second spot is seen on NBC's ''Today'' in New York City, a campaign must spend $3,500. The Lazio campaign has bought as many as 10 premium-priced spots on ''Today'' in a week; the more frugal Clinton campaign is more likely to buy about 5 a week. (Last week it bought 4.)</p>
        <p>Both have bought at least one $35,000 spot on ABC's ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.'' Both bought heavily on NBC's prime-time Olympics schedule, reaching women and men of all ages. Mrs. Clinton has tended to leave the field of major-league sports shows, with their predominantly male audiences, to Mr. Lazio, at least for now.</p>
        <p>A little bit here, a little more there. It adds up. The Lazio campaign has spent more than $6 million in the New York City market alone since early September; the Clinton campaign has spent more than $5 million in the same period.</p>
        <p>Ken Goldstein, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, said he believed that most of the money spent was wasted. ''Politics should be a rifle business,'' he said. ''Political campaigns' television advertising is a shotgun business. Immense amounts of money are spent trying to swing very, very few voters.''</p>
        <p>Nationally, he said, candidates spend more than half their money to reach the viewers of news programs. ''Of course, the ones watching are most likely to be interested in politics,'' said Professor Goldstein, who is tracking campaign advertising for a project at the Brennan Center, at New York University School of Law. ''But those are also the ones with the strongest partisan predilections and least likely to be influenced.''</p>
        <p>Brad Mont of Media Ad Ventures, a Virginia company placing ads for the Lazio campaign, said: ''Older people and women are easier to reach. Men and working women are tougher.'' But they can sometimes be found through expensive ads on prime-time dramas like ''E.R.'' and ''The West Wing,'' both on NBC, and ''The Practice'' on ABC.</p>
        <p>But viewers ''who are easier to reach cost less to reach,'' Mr. Mont added.</p>
        <p>Among people who watch television in the early afternoon, women outnumber men about three to one, according to the national data of Nielsen Media Research. In the New York City market last week, about 25 30-second spots from the Clinton campaign were broadcast during the early afternoon, costing the campaign about $38,000. Double that number, about 50, were broadcast by the Lazio campaign, at a cost of about $73,000.</p>
        <p>These viewers tend to be older and somewhat less educated. Mr. Goldstein and others refer to them as Edith Bunkers.</p>
        <p>''But Edith knew who she was going to vote for -- whoever Archie told her to vote for,'' Professor Goldstein said, his point being that even an ad intended for a group likely to include swing voters is wasted on many of those it reaches.</p>
        <p>It is easy to waste advertising money in the New York City media market, the biggest and most expensive in the country. Only about 4.4 million of the market's 6.9 million television households are actually in New York State. The rest are in New Jersey and Connecticut and one county in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>''Efficiency is not a concern'' for most campaign strategists, Professor Goldstein said. ''They are spending immense amounts of money for 1, 2, 3, 4 percent of the vote.'' A moment later, he added, ''If it's a close race, and those few percent of undecideds matter, you spend it.''</p>
        <p>Cable television offers candidates an alternative way to fine-tune their appeals. Records kept by Cablevision Systems show that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio are each spending up to $20,000 a week to reach that system's viewers in Brooklyn and the Bronx and in suburban communities on Long Island and in Westchester and Rockland Counties.</p>
        <p>The rise of cable, which has split the viewing audience into smaller and smaller pieces, makes an advertiser's life more difficult. ''Because of the diversity of channels that people have, you need to buy many more spot placements each week to have the insurance that people are seeing your ads,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton and a veteran of several earlier New York political contests.</p>
        <p>While New York City has two-thirds of the state's television households, campaigns also spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in upstate markets like Buffalo, Albany and Syracuse. On Thursday in Syracuse, all three 11 p.m. local news programs had ads for both candidates. Mr. Lazio's showed Gov. George E. Pataki praising the candidate's record. Mrs. Clinton's showed her discussing tax cuts she favors.</p>
        <p>Ads in upstate markets are much cheaper than those in New York City. ABC's Buffalo affiliate, WKBW-TV, charges the campaigns as little as $1,500 for a 30-second spot on ''The Practice.'' So far this fall, Mr. Lazio's campaign has spent more than $1 million in the Buffalo market; Mrs. Clinton's, more than $600,000.</p>
        <p>Now the campaigns are poised for the last wave of media buying. They will try to use the airwaves to answer each another, surprise each another, weaken each another -- all at what are, for campaigns, premium prices. After all, no candidate wants a knockout ad pre-empted.</p>
        <p>If so-called soft money -- unregulated contributions to groups like state party committees -- re-enters the campaign, television stations should fare nicely. Federal law requires that candidates' own campaign committees be charged the station's most favorable, or lowest, rates. Soft-money groups are not entitled to such discounts and often pay top price.</p>
        <p>If past campaigns are any guide, one program is certain to benefit most from the late spending surge: the Nov. 5 ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, two days before the election. Its viewers are universally considered to be a cornucopia of likely voters.</p>
        <p>''If there are X number of spots on that last pre-election '60 Minutes,' '' Mr. Mont said, there will be ''X plus 10'' campaign ads competing for air time. And when many buyers are chasing few goods, prices rise.</p>
