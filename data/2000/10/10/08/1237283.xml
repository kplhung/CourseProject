        <p>Mark Messier donned his red, white and blue No. 11 Rangers sweater for real for the first time in four seasons tonight. He lined up with Adam Graves and Brian Leetch for the national anthem. And he assisted on the Rangers' first goal in a 2-1 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers.</p>
        <p>''Tremendous,'' Graves said when asked how it felt to have Messier back.</p>
        <p>''It felt pretty natural,'' Leetch said.</p>
        <p>''It felt really good,'' Messier said after the Rangers opened a season with a victory for the first time since 1992-93.</p>
        <p>That season was otherwise forgettable, as were the team's last three, when the Rangers failed to make the playoffs. Even though the Rangers had to hang on to outlast the second-year Thrashers, a victory is a victory -- especially when it has taken the Rangers at least four games in each of the past four seasons to record their first one.</p>
        <p>''It's important to get off to a good start,'' Messier said, ''just because of the way things have gone the last few years.''</p>
        <p>Those years have not gone well for Messier, who spent the last three seasons in Vancouver before returning as a free agent in July, and the Rangers, who have not qualified for the playoffs since Messier left.</p>
        <p>This morning, Messier admitted to being excited about his return.</p>
        <p>''But I don't want to put too much emphasis on myself,'' he said. ''I want to get things really turned around here. I want us to get into the playoffs. I haven't been there in a few years myself.''</p>
        <p>If Messier and the Rangers are to get there for the first time in four seasons, they will have to improve on their performance of tonight. If there was one area in which there was serious improvement, however, it was the power play.</p>
        <p>''Special teams likely won the hockey game,'' said Ron Low, who recorded his first victory a the Rangers' coach.</p>
        <p>A year ago, the Rangers opened the season 9 for 112 on the power play. Tonight, they went 2 for 6, scoring both of their goals on the power play and holding the Thrashers scoreless in six power-play opportunities.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how many times I said last year, 'We need a goal a game on the power play,' '' said Leetch, who logged a game-high 30 minutes 22 seconds of ice time, even though he had been hampered in training camp by a sore groin muscle. ''Tonight we got two. And we won by one.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers led by 2-0 after one period on goals by Valery Kamensky and Petr Nedved. Kamensky, who had only 13 goals last season, scored 18:40 into the game, when the Rangers were skating five on three. Messier delivered the primary assist from the slot, feeding Kamensky at the bottom of the left wing circle, where he boomed a one-timer past a sliding Damian Rhodes for the Rangers' first goal of the season.</p>
        <p>Less than a minute later, Nedved made it a two-goal lead on a tap-in from just off the left wing post, after Rhodes had stopped Kim Johnsson's slap shot.</p>
        <p>That was it for the Rangers' offense, because of Rhodes's superior goaltending.</p>
        <p>Then defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, one of the team's key signings this season, twisted his left knee 12 minutes into the second period. The injury was diagnosed as a sprain, and Malakhov will be re-evaluated on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Thrashers capitalized almost immediately. Less than a minute after Malakhov skated off, Steve Guolla blasted a slap shot from the right wing circle off Kirk McLean's right pad. The goal ricocheted between McLean's legs and into the goal at 12:46 of the period. But McLean turned aside the other 27 shots he faced.</p>
        <p>And it was all the Rangers could do to hold onto the one-goal lead in Messier's return.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The Rangers opened the 2000-01 season with the third-oldest active roster, averaging 29 years 125 days, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Only the Detroit Red Wings (29 years 261 days) and the Toronto Maple Leafs (29 years 267 days) had older rosters in the 30-team National Hockey League. The Devils, at an average of 28 years 192 days, ranked 24th. The Islanders, at 27 years 11 days, had the 10th-youngest roster. The Tampa Bay Lightning (25 years 30 days) opened the season with the youngest roster in the league. . . . Goaltender MIKE RICHTER said he was cleared to take part in his first full practice, and will do so on Monday. Richter hopes to make his return from knee surgery in an Oct. 22 home game against Tampa Bay.</p>
