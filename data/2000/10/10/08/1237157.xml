        <p>THE announcement from the News Corporation last week was not exactly of the stop-the-presses variety: on Thursday, Rupert Murdoch, the company's founder and chairman, promoted his elder son, Lachlan. He received the title of deputy chief operating officer, a position just below that of the president and chief operating officer, Peter Chernin, Mr. Murdoch's trusted lieutenant, who has been at the company since 1989.</p>
        <p>The move was supposed to help clarify succession at the News Corporation, a $14 billion powerhouse with media properties spanning four continents that Mr. Murdoch built on the back of a single Australian newspaper inherited from his father. Earlier this year, investors became concerned after news leaked that Mr. Murdoch, 69, the tough-minded entrepreneur in control of 31 percent of the votes at the company, had prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>By moving Lachlan, 29, closer to the top rung, Mr. Murdoch, who says his cancer has been treated successfully, is seeking to assure investors that all is in order. ''There has been more focus on management succession because of Murdoch's illness and age,'' said Dennis Leibowitz, an analyst who follows media for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p>
        <p>But the real news may be building behind the headlines. In recent months, Mr. Murdoch's younger son, James, 27, has had an increasingly visible role at the News Corporation, raising the specter of competition between the two brothers over who will ultimately prove better qualified to run the company. There are no overt signs of friction between them, but James is working awfully hard for an executive whose path to the top is thought to be blocked by his older brother.</p>
        <p>''Given that both men are playing major roles in the company, they could decide to divide it,'' said Nell Minow, editor of Corporate Library, a Web site that tracks corporate governance issues. But if either man proves as headstrong as his father, she said, ''the competition will heat up and they could go for each other's throats.''</p>
        <p>''No one will really know until Murdoch is gone,'' she added.</p>
        <p>In the near term, of course, neither Murdoch scion is likely to take the helm of the News Corporation. Mr. Murdoch's current succession plan hands power to Mr. Chernin, 49. ''If anything should happen to me, Peter will step into my shoes,'' Mr. Murdoch said.</p>
        <p>But that may not be the end of the story. Some longtime media experts see a new wild card in John C. Malone, the nation's most powerful cable executive. Last month, his company, the Liberty Media Group, agreed to increase its stake in the News Corporation to 18 percent, but the shares carry no votes.</p>
        <p>A News Corporation executive said emphatically that Mr. Malone would be a passive investor. But that could change if there was a leadership vacuum at the top.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malone is a ''hard-nosed businessman, so Murdoch will need to keep an eye on him,'' said one veteran media expert who has followed both men's careers. ''If Murdoch steps aside, and there is no one to make the gigantic bets that move News Corp. forward, then who could oversee News Corp. better than Malone? And he has a big stake.''</p>
        <p>In an interview last week at the company's Midtown Manhattan offices, which are also home to his sole American newspaper, The New York Post, Mr. Murdoch vigorously denied that possibility. Mr. Malone, he said, ''does not own one share of voting stock.''</p>
        <p>''The only way he would get it is by buying News Corp. stock in the open market,'' he added. ''Look, Malone had 10 percent of Time Warner and did nothing. You don't understand John Malone. He brings a strategic vision. He is not interested in managing a company. He is interested in watching his investment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch, however, is expected to ask Mr. Malone to join the board, where ''he would add a strong voice,'' Mr. Murdoch said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malone did not return two telephone calls seeking an interview.</p>
        <p>The renewed speculation about succession comes on the eve of Mr. Murdoch's ambitious plan to expand the News Corporation's reach yet again during a period of rapid consolidation in the media industry. Next month, he plans to sell to the public a stake in the company's satellite business, which includes its interest in British Sky Broadcasting and Star TV, among other holdings. He also plans to add to the American satellite operations of the company by bidding for General Motors' Hughes Electronics, which owns DirecTV. Mr. Murdoch's empire already includes 20th Century Fox, the Fox Network, 23 television stations, cable programming services, newspapers and an international satellite business.</p>
        <p>Always opportunistic, Mr. Murdoch has never had a grand plan for how he will deploy his sons at the company. Each son has his own interests and experiences. So far, Lachlan has tended to focus on the more traditional businesses -- first in Australia and now in New York.</p>
        <p>James, meanwhile, has made a dash for the new-media frontier and is based in Hong Kong as the chief executive of Star TV, the company's satellite television business in Asia. ''I decided to send James to Asia because the job was open and the person we had there didn't work out,'' Mr. Murdoch said, speaking in typically flat and dispassionate tones in his large, unpretentious fourth-floor office.</p>
        <p>BUT while Lachlan won a sign of his father's confidence with the new title of deputy chief operating officer, James has begun to attract attention at the News Corporation and in the press. At least three people who know both sons say James is showing more of his father's entrepreneurial bent than his older brother does. ''I think James is bloody smart,'' one former Star TV executive said. ''I've been in meetings with both Lachlan and James. James's pure intellect outstrips Lachlan at the same age.''</p>
        <p>Predictably, their father sees it otherwise. ''Lachlan is very entrepreneurial,'' Mr. Murdoch said. ''He has a quiet side to him.''</p>
        <p>A person close to the company also gives Lachlan the nod, saying,  ''James has championed some Internet investments that have not worked out, while Lachlan has a good record in running the publishing businesses in Australia, and he works well with people.''</p>
        <p>This person added that James appeared to be somewhat unhappy that Lachlan was designated the heir before he jumped into the game. ''Now that he is there, he would like the competition to be on a level playing field,'' this person said.</p>
        <p>Both sons declined to be interviewed for this article.</p>
        <p>In large groups, James, who as a student never showed much interest in business, can seem arrogant and even vulgar. According to analysts who have heard him speak in the United States and the Far East, he sometimes laces his remarks with profanity. However, several former Star executives said James was shrewd in his thinking.</p>
        <p>If anything, James seemed the more rebellious of the pair, dropping out of Harvard University after majoring in medieval art and film animation. He started a record label before joining the News Corporation in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch has his own theory about the rebelliousness: ''That was more of a pose than anything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Regardless of James's sudden enthusiasm for business, Mr. Murdoch has remained committed to a plan that would one day put his first-born son in charge. ''Lachlan is senior at this stage, and I think it will stay that way, too,'' Mr. Murdoch said last week. ''I have a lot of admiration for him. He has done a great job.''</p>
        <p>Lachlan has worked at the company since he graduated from Princeton University in 1994 with a degree in philosophy. Starting as a general manager for two of the company's newspapers in Queensland, Australia, he soon took charge of all the Australian operations in print and cable. Last year, he added responsibilities for the company's United States print businesses, which include book publishing, The New York Post and a newspaper and magazine insert business. He joined the News Corporation board in 1996.</p>
        <p>The two sons have come nowhere near to matching their father's accomplishments at their ages. By the time he was 25, Mr. Murdoch was already running his late father's newspaper business in Australia. Pursuing growth with relentless drive, he quickly bought News Ideas, a weekly women's magazine, against the corporate board's wishes, then acquired a paper in Perth, The Sunday Times.</p>
        <p>But his sons are hard-working, media experts said, adding that it was impossible to know just how much Mr. Murdoch controlled their activities.</p>
        <p>Their ages and the fact that they won their posts because they are Murdochs is not lost on investors.  ''The Street feels comfortable with Chernin,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. ''It is less sure of how it feels about the children.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''in the back of everybody's minds, everybody knows that the company goes to them and that he keeps placing them in even stronger positions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch deflects further questioning about succession after his departure and Mr. Chernin's ascension. ''It would be a matter for the board, and it is still some years away,'' he said. ''They are still men in their 20's. In the interim period, they can play an important role. It is a big, diverse company.''</p>
        <p>MR. MURDOCH, however, does seem to have kept an eye on other family-controlled companies. He pointed out that ''there were 20 years without a Ford running the Ford Motor Company, and they control most of the money.''</p>
        <p>In any case, as the situation now stands, financial control will eventually be divided among Mr. Murdoch's two sons and two daughters, Prudence and Elisabeth. Like the Ford descendants, they will ultimately hold the powerful voting stock, even while Mr. Chernin occupies the executive suite.</p>
        <p>The Murdoch family's 31 percent stake is held by an Australian trust, Cruden Investments, in which each of the four children has a stake. Prudence, 42, is his daughter from his first marriage. Elisabeth, 32, is the older sister of Lachlan and James, by Anna, his second wife, whom he divorced a year ago. (Last year, Mr. Murdoch married Wendi Deng, a Chinese woman who is roughly Elisabeth's age, but she has no stake in Cruden. They met when she was an executive at Star TV. She has since resigned to ''keep me fed and well,'' Mr. Murdoch said.)</p>
        <p>So far, the Murdoch progeny have apparently tried to avoid friction  with one another, each choosing a representative to sit on Cruden's eight-member board, on which Mr. Murdoch himself has four seats and effective control. Once Mr. Murdoch is gone, he noted that the majority of the votes would determine Cruden's position on issues. But, he continued, ''if the kids fought hard enough, the whole thing would break down; there is no mechanism against that happening.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch, a known workaholic, has no intention of stepping back as long as he can still work. His two months' of radiation treatment are over, and he was looking well during a recent interview, dressed in a dark blue suit and blue shirt that highlighted the tan he had acquired at his ranch in Carmel, Calif. Mr. Murdoch, who still speaks with a heavy Australian accent, boasted, ''I have not missed a single day of work.''</p>
        <p>He is traveling as much as ever, he said, with his doctor's blessing, and dismissed the seriousness of his disease. ''I tell you there are hundreds of chief executives walking around who have had my kind of cancer and had it treated successfully,'' he noted.</p>
        <p>STILL, as the company has grown in the last 11 years, Mr. Murdoch has handed a portion of responsibility to Mr. Chernin, who ran the company's all-important television operations and cable operations and is well regarded on Wall Street and in the media industry. For the year ended June 30, the company reported net income of $1.2 billion on revenue of $14.15 billion, compared with a profit of $678 million on revenue of $13.59 billion a year earlier. But the performance in fiscal 2000 was buoyed by several one-time asset sales, including $763 million for the company's stake in Echostar, a direct-to-home satellite business, and roughly $400 million from its stake in Ansett Airlines.</p>
        <p>But on an operating basis, profits were virtually flat, at $1.7 billion, largely because of problems at the movie studio and the Fox television network. There, ratings have fallen to their worst levels in years as audiences lost interest in former hits like ''Beverly Hills 90210.'' The network has several new shows this fall, including ''The Street,'' a program about Wall Street, which it hopes will lead to a ratings turnaround.</p>
        <p>Profits at 20th Century Fox Film were hurt not only by the costly flop ''Titan A.E.'' last June, but also by comparisons to 1999, which included video sales from two big hits, ''Titanic'' and ''There's Something About Mary.''</p>
        <p>In the last three years, the News Corporation's stock has not performed as well as that of Viacom or Time Warner, though it has outperformed Disney's. Analysts say they think that Mr. Murdoch, always a profligate spender on new ventures, has become somewhat more conservative in the use of debt. Today, the company has $9.2 billion in debt, which is a manageable 47 percent of total equity, and the payments stretch far into the future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chernin receives some of the credit. He focuses on day-to-day operations, he said, freeing Mr. Murdoch to make strategic decisions. As for the children, Mr. Chernin says he speaks often with both Lachlan and James -- not surprising, given Mr. Murdoch's intentions to groom them.</p>
        <p>''He has been straightforward that he would like his kids to take over the company,'' Mr. Chernin said. ''It is fair to say that there is a goal which Rupert talks about -- about how do we give his children the appropriate experiences to learn and grow inside the company.''</p>
        <p>But not everything has gone according to plan. For a while, Elisabeth worked at the News Corporation, both in the United States and Britain, most recently as managing director of BSkyB's channel and programming operations. Early on, she had openly voiced her determination to compete for the top spot with Lachlan. But last April, she abruptly resigned to start her own film and television company and spend more time with her family. Divorced from a Ghanian banker, Elkin Pianim, and the mother of two children, she recently became pregnant by Matthew Freud, a British public relations executive who is also the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud.</p>
        <p>As the British newspapers told it, she informed her father of her decision to quit only after telling BSkyB executives of her plans.</p>
        <p>''I was not thrilled,'' her father said of his daughter's departure. As to whether he would bankroll her new venture, Mr. Murdoch sounded like any angry parent. ''There is no way we are funding it,'' he said adamantly. ''She can learn the hard way.''</p>
        <p>Because Ms. Murdoch had some stock in BSkyB, he added, ''she can afford to do it.'' No News Corporation company has as yet agreed to buy her programs, but Mr. Murdoch said, ''I would think she would try hard to pitch them to Sky and everyone else in England.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch, however, shows grudging admiration for his daughter, saying that she ''is more like me'' than any of the other children. ''She is more headstrong by nature,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although he said that he would  ''love to have her back'' at the company, he sounded as if she might have to pay a price for her willful ways.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what job she would get,'' he said. ''It would depend on what was available.''</p>
        <p>And there will be much family competition. By all accounts, James is 100 percent focused on the company's plan to spin off Sky Global Networks, its international satellite business that includes Star TV. His obsession is doing deals, analysts say, and the rationale is to generate a buzz for Star's role in the initial public offering.</p>
        <p>James is also taking up a longtime corporate quest of breaking into China. Under Star's previous chairman, Gareth Chang, the company was unable to establish a presence in the mainland Chinese market, aside from its successful Phoenix TV channel. Mr. Chang's failure to make more inroads resulted in his dismissal.</p>
        <p>Rather than butt his head against the wall, James shifted Star's focus to India, which lacks the suffocating regulations that make China a nightmare. ''James sees India and China as the engine room of Star,'' the former Star executive said. ''But he sees China as a slow burn. He needed to have a couple of successes, which he got in India.''</p>
        <p>STAR'S success in India has actually had little to do with James. Rather, it has come because Star carried the Indian version of the British television show, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which shattered all ratings records and has singlehandedly put Star at the head of the list among cable operators in India.</p>
        <p>Former executives say Star hopes to build on its programming success by gaining more control over the channel's distribution. To do that, Star bought 26 percent of the country's third-largest cable system, Hathaway Cable, whose subscribers are clustered in Bombay. The strategy -- vertically integrating programming and distribution -- is a typical Murdoch approach. Vivek Couto, an analyst with Kagan Asia Media in Hong Kong, said, ''What they're doing, and what I believe could turn it around for them, is trying to own the subscriber.'' Star TV will receive a larger chunk of revenue from the cable system's subscribers.</p>
        <p>For now, both sons can rest assured that their father views the News Corporation as a legacy. Although critics have said for years that he has diminished the quality of publications he has acquired (notably newspapers in the United States and in Britain) and has broadcast particularly violent shows on the Fox Network, Mr. Murdoch is unbowed.</p>
        <p>''I think I have brought diversity to the media,'' he said. ''I have taken deadbeat newspapers and made them livelier.''</p>
        <p>He dismisses the impact of the brand of violent television programming that he is often credited with championing. ''Unnecessary violence turns people off,'' he said. ''People simply walk out. The marketplace settles it.''</p>
        <p>The News Corporation, he said, is a legacy that he will be proud to one day hand over. But the question remains: Who will ultimately run it?</p>
