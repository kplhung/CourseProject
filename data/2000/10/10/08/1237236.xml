        <p>The story of Rwanda's genocide in 1994 has few heroes.

        <p>The story of Rwanda's genocide in 1994 has few heroes. It was mass murder carried out with machete and hoe, by neighbor against neighbor, with the complicity of the country's churches and elected leaders. The United Nations had a small contingent of peacekeepers in Rwanda before the genocide, but these troops were not allowed to act, and they were pulled out, not reinforced, as the mass killing began.</p>
        <p>Last year, the U.N. released an extraordinary inquiry into its failure to prevent or stop the genocide. It was harshly critical of the Security Council, of the Americans and the French, and of most officials at U.N. headquarters, including Kofi Annan, who was then head of peacekeeping and is now secretary general. But the report detailed how one man consistently warned of the coming genocide and sought authorization to act: Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire of Canada, commander of U.N. forces in Rwanda.</p>
        <p>General Dallaire has since become, in his own way, a victim of Rwanda's violence and of the limitations of U.N. peacekeeping. In late June, he has confirmed, he was found semiconscious in a park in Hull, Quebec. Two months before, he had taken early retirement from the military for medical reasons. Psychotherapy has helped General Dallaire recover enough to start a job as an adviser to Canada's minister for international cooperation on protecting children in wartime, but he is still suffering from what he calls the ''peacekeepers' injury,'' post-traumatic stress.</p>
        <p>He told me in a recent telephone interview that it had first hit him four years after his return from Rwanda. He couldn't eat, sleep or concentrate enough to read a newspaper. ''I am in a valley at sunset, waist deep in bodies, covered in blood,'' he said, describing one of the scenes that appeared, over and over, before his eyes. ''I am holding up my arms trying to get out. Each time it comes back, the scene is worse. I can hear the rustle of bodies, and I am afraid to move for fear of hurting someone.''</p>
        <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder was once known as shell shock, and the soldiers who had it used to be considered shirkers or weak. It is far more common than acknowledged. A study of American Vietnam veterans in 1985 showed that 30 percent had suffered from it at some point since returning from the war.</p>
        <p>Now new imaging methods show that the brain processes traumatic memories very differently than normal ones. For one thing, they are not integrated into the stream of memories so the sufferer does not recognize that what he is seeing took place in the past. ''When these events happen, they are a blur,'' General Dallaire said. ''But the flashbacks are digitally clear and come one at a time. They do not disappear over time, and your normal state becomes acute depression. You look for ways of reducing your depression with booze and drugs.''</p>
        <p>His experience, and his willingness to talk about it, has led to reforms in the way Canada treats post-traumatic stress. It is now officially recognized as a war injury, and Canada has set up centers for educating peacekeepers about stress and treating it early. Post-traumatic stress is as old as war, but it is a particular danger for peacekeepers. All soldiers witness horror, but in some peacekeeping missions, like the one in Rwanda, troops are barred from acting. ''Soldiers witness crimes against humanity but are ordered not to interfere,'' General Dallaire said. ''There is enormous frustration in witnessing genocide and being powerless to do anything.''</p>
        <p>In January 1994, he sent a fax to U.N. headquarters reporting that a Hutu militia informer had said that he was training men who could kill ''up to 1,000 Tutsi in 20 minutes'' and that all Tutsi in the capital were being registered, most likely for their extermination.</p>
        <p>General Dallaire's cable was not taken seriously enough to spur any action. After the killing began in April, he asked for more men and a mandate that would let them intervene. Instead, the U.N. cut his 2,500 troops to a tenth that number. The 1999 U.N. inquiry agreed with General Dallaire that a few thousand men, given the proper training and mandate, might have saved 800,000 lives. ''We didn't need overwhelming force, but punctual and appropriate use of force,'' he said. ''I needed three battalions in the first three weeks to break the embryo of genocide.''</p>
        <p>Only now, after the paralysis of U.N. peacekeepers was echoed in Bosnia and, most recently, in Sierra Leone, is the world beginning to take a serious look at how to make peacekeeping more effective. A panel of experts commissioned by Mr. Annan reported in August that the peacekeeping department was stretched to the breaking point and ill informed about the conflicts into which it was sending soldiers, and that it suffered from poor coordination between military and political tasks and a misguided neutrality that often made peacekeepers treat victims and victimizers alike. At the U.N. summit meeting in New York last month, world leaders gave the recommended changes an unusually strong endorsement. The experiences of General Dallaire speak eloquently of the need to make U.N. peacekeeping operations more effective and resolute.</p>
