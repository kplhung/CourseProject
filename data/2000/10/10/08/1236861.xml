        <p>LOOKING up, we saw shimmering water, backlighted by the sun, roaring over and in front of us. Below was a gaping green chasm, a 200-foot drop to a pool below. Beneath our feet, a rocky ledge four feet wide was all that protected us from free fall. It was heaven.</p>
        <p>We were behind the thundering, 500-foot Kapoloa Falls in a remote northern valley on the Big Island of Hawaii, clinging to a ledge that was part of the Kohala Mountain trail system built in 1905.

        <p>LOOKING up, we saw shimmering water, backlighted by the sun, roaring over and in front of us. Below was a gaping green chasm, a 200-foot drop to a pool below. Beneath our feet, a rocky ledge four feet wide was all that protected us from free fall. It was heaven.</p>
        <p>We were behind the thundering, 500-foot Kapoloa Falls in a remote northern valley on the Big Island of Hawaii, clinging to a ledge that was part of the Kohala Mountain trail system built in 1905. Beyond the wall of water a few feet in front of us, the steep sides of Pololu Valley opened to the ocean a mile away. In this narrow chamber of moisture, sound, rock and moss, the air smelled clean and green, and I could feel the intense rumble of the falls clear down to my toes.</p>
        <p>Kapoloa was the fifth and final waterfall we encountered on an easy guided hike late last January into Pololu, the end of the road and the first of seven valleys, mostly inaccessible, lining the northern coast of the Big Island in the district of North Kohala. Because Kamehameha I, the king who united the Hawaiian Islands in the late 1700's, spent his first five years in the far reaches of this valley, the King Kamehameha statue in the town of Kapaau had seemed an appropriate place to launch our outing.</p>
        <p>We met our guide, from Hawaii Forest and Trail, and our group of eight at 8:30 a.m. -- not easy after two sleepless nights. The first was at the barracks-like Kohala Village Inn, the only accommodation in town that wasn't a bed-and-breakfast. Rowdy, partying teenagers -- the front desk clerk had closed up for the night-- and a lumpy bed drove us the next day to a B &amp; B. It seemed idyllic until the dogs started barking at 1 a.m. Thus severely sleep-deprived, my companion, Brad, and I approached the hike with trepidation.</p>
        <p>Our guide, Danny Almonte, chauffeured the four-wheel-drive van seven miles to the end of the road, past barely-there rural towns that were busier in premissionary  times, when fishing villages made this coast one of the most populated areas of the islands. We drove through a gate onto private lands, lurching over bumpy former sugar-cane roads to the trailhead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Almonte informed us that we would follow the first mile and a half of a trail system built during construction in 1905-1906 of the Kohala Ditch, 16 miles of tunnels and 6 miles of open waterways carved into the oldest mountain range on the island. At 1,000 feet above the valley floor, this marvel of engineering transported water from deep in the Kohala Mountains to the sugar-cane fields of North Kohala and beyond. With the sugar plantations closed since the mid-1970's, the irrigation system is a historic artifact, as well as fertile ground for recreation. Best of all, the trail is level.</p>
        <p>We saw our first waterfall within 1,000 feet. Then another, then another, and in between, bridges of stone and wood and some of the 57 tunnels that Japanese laborers built into the mountain. Seventeen of those laborers died on the 18-month project.</p>
        <p>Kapoloa Falls was the holy grail of this hike, and when we finally came to it, 500 feet of liquid force cascading in front of a tiny ledge, the adrenaline rush was fierce.</p>
        <p>The hike was the perfect complement to the mountain kayak cruise that we had taken in 1998, through the flumes of the same mountain waterway system. Both adventures offer access to what was once the most remote region of the Big Island.</p>
        <p>Until the Kawaihae-Mahukona coastal Highway 270 opened in 1968, three years after Laurance Rockefeller unveiled his Mauna Kea Beach Hotel in Kawaihae, only one road connected the plantation communities of Hawi and Kapaau with the rest of the island. Today, only two miles apart on the one main road, Hawi and Kapaau are fast becoming an extended playground for guests at the elegant Kohala Coast resorts just 40 minutes away.</p>
        <p>Even residents of Waimea, the gentrified upcountry town between the base of the Kohala Mountain and the flanks of Mauna Kea Mountain, are venturing north for the same urbane pleasures -- shopping, dining, gallery-hopping -- that they usually reserve for their own turf. The ''old road,'' the Kohala Mountain Road, takes you from Waimea to Hawi in half an hour, through scenery unequaled on the island. This is still my favorite Big Island drive.</p>
        <p>High above the coastline the views encompass the ocean and three of the five Big Island mountains (Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa and Hualalai), which were once active volcanos, like Kilauea on the other side of the island. The hillside is blanketed with a million velvety greens. The road winds through tall ironwoods, emerald-covered cinder cones, and the undulating landscape of ranch lands. Often the Waimea mists roll in from the heights, bringing brilliant rainbows with them.</p>
        <p>In Hawi, a charming tropical-chic restaurant named Bamboo reigns as the neighborhood's nexus. Built some time between 1911 and 1915, the rambling two-story wooden structure glows at night with thousands of fairy lights that spice up the town's Dodge City atmosphere. The interior -- a retro feast of wicker, rattan, bamboo walls and such 1940's Hawaii memorabilia as old Matson liner menus -- achieves a pleasing tropical saloon effect with a pinch of bordello. Hawaiian women with flowers in their hair serve salads from nearby gardens and fish fresh from the hooks of friends and family.</p>
        <p>Hawi's newly reinvigorated commercial mix includes gift shops, snack bars, restaurants and a few generations-old mom-and-pop stores, all lined up on a single street behind modest wooden storefronts. Nevertheless, the rural flavor remains, and the atmosphere is easygoing, almost sleepy. One can easily imagine the horses tied up in front and wagons rolling through town in the early 1900's. At Kohala Coffee Mill, we tried locally made Tropical Dreams ice cream (Tahitian vanilla and macadamia nut that day, but the flavors change) and polished off a macadamia nut torte made by the pastry chef of a Kohala Coast resort. Many of the businesses, like the M. Nakahara Store, have been there since the heyday of the sugar companies, when they served as the lifeblood of the plantation communities.</p>
        <p>''A lot of this has to do with survival, you know,'' Richard Nakahara told me after I admired his selection of zoris (the rubber flip-flops that are ubiquitous in Hawaii), fishing lures and gift items. ''We carry a lot of these items because they're not carried by the big-box retailers.'' That includes a small counter in the grocery section that sells a legendary rotisserie chicken and other prepared foods. We joined the brigade of savvy local shoppers and bought a chicken, then devoured it in the parking lot and declared it the best in Kohala.</p>
        <p>Residents like Mr. Nakahara are the old-timers of Kohala, who are watching their towns rise from the ashes of the plantation's demise. Gladys Nanbu, who lives in Halaula near Pololu Valley, supports the changes. ''We used to play marbles, jump rope, go swimming in the ponds,'' she recalled. ''We never had luxury. We were all in the same-predicament country. It was simple, yet we enjoyed life. The changes in town are wonderful, because there's more to offer.''</p>
        <p>The changes include new residents, some of them ''retirees'' on a second career, such as Frank Morgan, who owns the Kohala Book Shop in Kapaau with his wife, Jan. ''Kohala reminds me of 'Northern Exposure,' '' he told us. ''There are the expats, the 'aging hippie' group, the retired academics and professionals, writers and artists, and the people who have been here all their lives, their families for generations.  But Kohala is still rural and remote enough so you wouldn't know any of the new people are here.''</p>
        <p>Before moving to Kohala in 1991, the Morgans spent 30 years in Boston, where he was bureau chief for Newsweek and later was founding editor of Inc. magazine.</p>
        <p>Their Kohala Book Shop is the largest used-book store in Hawaii, a place to linger over thoughtfully labeled, mostly used books specializing in Hawaii and Oceania.</p>
        <p>The shop is in the turn-of-the-century Nanbu Building, listed on the register of National Historic Places and the most prominent new feature on the Kohala landscape. Faithfully restored by Neal Price, who was looking for an office for his medical products company after moving from Colorado, the building is painted butterscotch yellow with green and red trim, exuding a jaunty energy. Between the bookshop and the Elements jewelry store, the new Nanbu Courtyard coffee shop serves espresso and panini sandwiches. A doctor of Chinese medicine has her office in the complex, and in the rear, a local institution named Holy's Bakery still proffers its breads and buttered pies, as it has since 1932.</p>
        <p>Close to the Nanbu, Jen's Kohala Cafe serves superb wraps and sandwiches. At an outdoor table, practically in the shade of the huge Kamehameha Statue across the street, we enjoyed a Greek wrap and pondered the life of the Hawaiian warrior-king who was born at the Kohala seashore in 1758.</p>
        <p>His birth, near Mookini Heiau (a pre-Christian stone temple), launched a series of events that permanently shaped the lore of Kohala and the history of Hawaii. I enjoyed an interview with a local raconteur and musician, Clyde Sproat, whose family has lived in Polulu for generations and who  tells the wild story of Kamehameha's birth and his successful flight into Pololu Valley. Because a priest had prophesied that there would be ''one so strong that he will be the killer of chiefs,'' he said, a death sentence greeted the young chief's birth. Kokoiki, Kamehameha's birthplace, means ''little blood,'' said Mr. Sproat, referring to the first signs of childbirth. Hawi, meaning ''unable to breathe,'' was where the child, being spirited away by a servant, required resuscitation and nursing. Kapaau, meaning ''wet blanket,'' was where heavy rain soaked the infant's kapa (blanket). Halaula (scattered blood) was the town where soldiers were killed in anger.</p>
        <p>''Once they got to Pololu, they were safe,''  Mr. Sproat continued. ''No one would find him. Kamehameha lived in Awini, on the far side of the valley, until he was 5 years old.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sproat grew up two valleys beyond Pololu in the valley of Honokaneiki and stayed there until his family moved when he was 7. Although he now lives at the Pololu Valley Lookout at the end of the road, he still keeps a cabin in Honokaneiki, a hundred yards from the ocean. When he retreats there with his wife, Cheryl, he says, the solitude is profound. He is protected from change, which he views philosophically but with caution. ''People move to Kohala from back east and want to change the old style for the new,'' he said. ''It's all right but it's not all right. At one time everyone here had a chicken or two and a pig or two. Now they come and want everybody around them to have no chickens . . .''</p>
        <p>To leave North Kohala, we took the Kohala Mountain Road again and were rewarded with exceptional visibility. Around us, the grasses and ironwoods rippled like ribbons in the wind. Below us to the west, the coastline leading to Kamehameha's birthplace was blinding in the sunlight. Also beneath  was the oldest mountain on the island, Kohala, and before us, like three massive sentinels, the summits of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa and Hualalai scrolled into view. Snow covered the pinnacle of Mauna Kea, and we knew that beyond it, hidden from view, the volcano Kilauea was erupting.</p>
