        <p>Want to hire a dot-com spokesman cheap? Priceline.com seems to have gotten William Shatner for next to nothing in cash by paying him in stock options that have tanked. ''That's one way to look at it,'' said Brian Ek, a company spokesman. ''But I'm not going to touch that one.''</p>
        <p>Priceline's shares now trade at $5.56, down 53 percent last week alone; their 52-week high was $104.25. While Mr. Shatner sold nearly half his 125,000 shares before the stock plunged, he still held about 65,000 as of March.</p>
