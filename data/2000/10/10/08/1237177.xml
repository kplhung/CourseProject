        <p>Thomas Brown has never been one to mince words in his career as a Wall Street analyst and, more recently, as a hedge fund manager and proprietor of Bankstocks.com. But on his site last week, he outdid even his earlier barbs about banking executives and analysts.</p>
        <p>His target was Richard Barrett, financial institutions investment banking chief at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, who will have the same job after Donaldson merges with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''Dick Barrett,'' he wrote, is ''the type that give investment bankers a bad name. Clients that have followed their M. &amp; A. advice have destroyed billions of dollars of shareholder value.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown has borne a grudge against Mr. Barrett since 1998, when Mr. Brown was fired as Donaldson's banking analyst just as Mr. Barrett was hired. Mr. Brown believes he was fired at Mr. Barrett's urging because of bearish opinions on several of Mr. Barrett's clients. Then, a week and a half ago, the combined Credit Suisse and Donaldson decided to retain Donaldson's banking analyst, Susan Roth, who has worked with Mr. Barrett, and fire Credit Suisse's often bearish analyst, Michael Mayo. Mr. Brown believes Mr. Barrett was again responsible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett shrugged. ''I do not know Tom Brown other than by reputation, and I had not role in his departure,'' he said. ''The whole notion that you can have banker-friendly research in nonsensical. Analysts have to have credibility or they are not useful to investment bankers or clients.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said he had received little reaction on his Web posting, except for one obvious response: Donaldson will no longer be sending him its bank research reports.</p>
