        <p>Pres Bill Clinton, national security advisor Samuel R Berger and Vice Pres Al Gore comment on what they were thinking on April 8, 1997, when briefing in White House Map Room for state arrival of Canadian Prime Min Chretien was breaking up; photo (M)</p>

        <p>President Clinton: ''I was thinking the vice president should re-enact this scene at the convention in 2000. Actually, we were being briefed for the state arrival of Prime Minister Chretien [of Canada]. I was focused on making this visit a success. I wanted Chretien, an ally and a close personal friend, to feel good about it. Also, I had recently hurt my knee and wanted to make sure that the injury didn't cause any problems during the day. I had to be very careful by trying to minimize pain and discomfort and do two physical therapy sessions a day. At the same time, I was working on the balanced-budget agreement with Congress. I felt relieved that we had weathered the G.O.P. shutdown of the government and won the election, and was determined to work with Congress to get a good balanced budget.''</p>
        <p>Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser: ''I thought it was my Canada briefing that was making the room warmer.''</p>

        <p>Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser: ''I thought it was my Canada briefing that was making the room warmer.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Gore (second from right): ''Tipper had come in during the briefing, and so when we started breaking up to go outside to the South Lawn for the official arrival, we finally got to say hi to each other. I wasn't self-conscious at all. I didn't think anybody else was paying attention to us. I was just thinking, 'I'm really glad to see you and I love you.' This was a time of incredible transition in our lives. We were finally coming to grips with the fact that our first daughter was about to go from being our little girl to somebody else's wife. It is a strange fact of the vice presidency, or any elected office, that your personal life becomes intertwined with your public one. It's something I'm not sure you ever quite grow used to.''</p>
