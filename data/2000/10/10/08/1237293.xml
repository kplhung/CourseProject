        <p>Article praises Seattle Mariners Manager Lou Piniella in view of this team's sweep of Chicago White Sox in American League playoff series; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Even after relocating to the mellow Pacific Northwest in 1993, Lou Piniella never seemed particularly pacifistic. When the Mariners' manager mimicked Mount St. Helen's, his temper tantrums created a cartoon caricature that clouded his success.</p>
        <p>''We can remember his tirades, him kicking his hat and pulling the bases up and then, the next day, him coming in and he can't bend over because he pulled his back out trying to get the base out,'' said Jay Buhner, Seattle's veteran outfielder who was a rookie with the Yankees in 1987, when Piniella was managing the team. ''But as he's gotten a little older, like a lot of us, he's found out that the more you snap and get mad and overexert yourself, it takes too much out of you.''</p>

        <p>Even after relocating to the mellow Pacific Northwest in 1993, Lou Piniella never seemed particularly pacifistic. When the Mariners' manager mimicked Mount St. Helen's, his temper tantrums created a cartoon caricature that clouded his success.</p>
        <p>''We can remember his tirades, him kicking his hat and pulling the bases up and then, the next day, him coming in and he can't bend over because he pulled his back out trying to get the base out,'' said Jay Buhner, Seattle's veteran outfielder who was a rookie with the Yankees in 1987, when Piniella was managing the team. ''But as he's gotten a little older, like a lot of us, he's found out that the more you snap and get mad and overexert yourself, it takes too much out of you.''</p>
        <p>According to Jerry Manuel, Chicago's manager, the Mariners ''outmanaged'' the White Sox while sweeping the three-of-five-game American League Division Series. After Friday afternoon's clincher in Safeco Field, a 2-1 Mariners victory, Buhner said that ''Lou's been incredible'' this season and that ''I see a new gleam in his eye.''</p>
        <p>''How many times has he gotten kicked out of games this year, one?'' Buhner said. ''He's still a very emotional guy. He wears his emotions on his sleeve. But he realizes he doesn't have to kick some of these guys in the butt. He's an absolute pleasure to work for and I would run through a wall for that guy. Period.''</p>
        <p>The next walls the Mariners inhabit will be in the A.L. Championship Series, a four-of-seven-game event that will begin for Seattle on the road on Tuesday. The Mariners qualified for the tournament as the wild-card entry and they ousted the Central Division champion White Sox with a balanced attack of pitching, fielding, timely hitting -- and shrewd personnel moves by the manager.</p>
        <p>The winning play, in the bottom of the ninth Friday, was a safety-squeeze bunt that went for a single by the pinch-hitter Carlos Guillen. It was Guillen's first at-bat of the series, scoring the pinch-runner Rickey Henderson from third base. The victory gave Piniella a 17-11 record in postseason competition. He won the World Series with Cincinnati 10 years ago. He has taken the Mariners to the playoffs three times. He began managing in 1986 with the Yankees after a 23-year professional playing career that began in 1962.</p>
        <p>Piniella played most of his career with the Yankees and Kansas City. Although he was once the property of the Washington Senators and the Seattle Pilots, he never actually played for those teams.</p>
        <p>Now 57, Piniella said, ''I've calmed down a heck of a lot over the last three or four years.''</p>
        <p>He still picks his spots and influences events with cunning -- or is it just dumb luck or coincidence? In Game 1 of the Mariners-White Sox series, with the score tied at 4-4 in the 10th inning in Comiskey Park, Piniella suddenly called a timeout and went to first base to speak to Mike Cameron, who had singled. Cameron laughed when it happened and said afterward that he had not seen such a thing since Little League. But neither he nor Piniella would reveal what was said.</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, it may have unnerved Josh Paul, Chicago's inexperienced substitute catcher, who did not get Cameron with a pitchout but saw Cameron steal second on the following pitch. Perhaps it distracted Manuel, a less-experienced manager, who neglected to intentionally walk the dangerous batter, Edgar Martinez, to fill the suddenly empty base and set up a force play. Or, maybe it bothered Keith Foulke, the pitcher, who gave up two consecutive home runs, to Martinez and John Olerud, to seal a 7-4 Seattle victory.</p>
        <p>When the Mariners traded Ken Griffey Jr. to Cincinnati last winter, Piniella lobbied to get Cameron as part of the deal. When asked about the personality of his new manager, Cameron said: ''It seems like he's at peace right now. It seems like someone came down and touched him on the shoulder and walks with him every single day. That's a blessing from the skies. I never imagined it when I first got here.''</p>
        <p>Buhner has played with Seattle since 1988 and has seen several Mariners managers. He said Piniella was delegating more authority to coaches and communicating well with his players. ''He understands this is a special ball club,'' Buhner said.</p>
        <p>After Friday's game, Piniella spoke in the corridor next to the Champagne-splashed locker room. He puffed occasionally on a cigarette and held in his other hand a paper cup. Like his superstar shortstop, Alex Rodriguez, Piniella could benefit from free agency this winter. So far, Piniella has rebuffed discussions about an extension to his expiring contract. ''We'll talk,'' Piniella said.</p>
        <p>Piniella said he was happy to use the depth of his roster, and he is proud that his players can bunt after practicing the art so much in spring training, at his insistence. ''We have a multitude of talents who can do little things to win baseball games,'' Piniella said. ''Basically, I let my players play. I want them to have fun, I want them to be relaxed and loose and go out and give me all they've got. When players execute, it makes managers look good. When they don't, a manager has to explain.''</p>
