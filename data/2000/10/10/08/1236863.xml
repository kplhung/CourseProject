        <p>FOR many of the tens of millions of Americans who participate in frequent-flier programs, it is feast or famine. Some road warriors have so many frequent-flier miles sitting in their accounts that they have no hope of using them up, or no desire to cash them in to spend even more time away from home, while other occasional fliers have too few miles to qualify for any travel award.</p>
        <p>A pair of Internet start-ups, MilePoint and AOL AAdvantage, are taking aim at both groups. MilePoint (www.milepoint.com) is scheduled to begin accepting memberships sometime this month and will allow frequent fliers to convert their miles into a form of online currency that can be used for discounts of 5 to 25 percent with a variety of retailers, including Amazon.com, The Sharper Image and Hammacher Schlemmer.</p>

        <p>FOR many of the tens of millions of Americans who participate in frequent-flier programs, it is feast or famine. Some road warriors have so many frequent-flier miles sitting in their accounts that they have no hope of using them up, or no desire to cash them in to spend even more time away from home, while other occasional fliers have too few miles to qualify for any travel award.</p>
        <p>A pair of Internet start-ups, MilePoint and AOL AAdvantage, are taking aim at both groups. MilePoint (www.milepoint.com) is scheduled to begin accepting memberships sometime this month and will allow frequent fliers to convert their miles into a form of online currency that can be used for discounts of 5 to 25 percent with a variety of retailers, including Amazon.com, The Sharper Image and Hammacher Schlemmer.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, each mile in the frequent-flier programs of six airlines -- America West, Continental, Delta, Northwest, T.W.A. and US Airways -- can be converted to 2  cents in MilePoint Money.</p>
        <p>Ten thousand miles, for example, would convert to $200 in discounts. Members of the Hilton Hotels frequent-guest program will also be allowed to convert their Hilton points to MilePoint Money at a rate of one point to 2  cents.</p>
        <p>AOL AAdvantage, a partnership between America Online and American Airlines that was announced early this year, goes a step further.</p>
        <p>Its site, www.aolaadvantage.com, is already open for business and allows members of the American Airlines AAdvantage program to convert their miles directly into merchandise, ranging from books and videos to coffee makers to electronic equipment, without any additional cash payment. The current catalog of more than 60 items ranges from the latest Backstreet Boys CD (2,500 miles) to a telescope (11,750 miles) to a Toshiba DVD player (34,250 miles).</p>
        <p>David Hakensen, a spokesman for MilePoint, acknowledged that the maximum 25 percent discount offered by its retail partners is modest. Many prominent e-retailers have offered far more dramatic discounts in recent months -- in some cases, virtually giving their merchandise away -- hoping to build a customer base.</p>
        <p>But he said that the plan should still appeal to many of the nearly 61 million Americans who are registered with frequent-flier programs and have no desire -- or, because they have so few miles, no ability -- to use them for travel.</p>
        <p>He said the company's research showed that about half of all frequent fliers, or nearly 30 million travelers, had too few miles for an award. ''In the past, they couldn't utilize those miles,'' he said. ''Now they have a form of currency. This is a way to utilize them.''</p>
        <p>Members register their frequent-flier account numbers at the MilePoint site and then apply their miles to shopping at the online MilePoint Mall. The MilePoint currency can be used as payment toward a purchase. Other online merchants in the program include The Wine Enthusiast, Brooks Brothers and L. L. Bean.</p>
