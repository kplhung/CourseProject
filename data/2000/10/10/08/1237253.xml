        <p>In a new memoir, former President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia says that he had all but decided in 1996 to upend the democratic process in Russia by banning the Communist Party, dissolving Parliament and postponing presidential elections he seemed certain at the time to lose.</p>
        <p>With his approval rating bottomed out at 3 percent, the Russian leader says, he came to the conclusion that he was not ''able to manage the crisis within the framework of the current Constitution'' and though he knew he would ''pay a heavy price in credibility,'' he ordered decrees drafted that would have effectively turned his rule into a dictatorship.</p>
        <p>In doing so, he recounts, ''I would fix one of the main problems I'd had since the beginning of my presidential term,'' namely that ''the Communist Party would be finished forever in Russia.'' He credits his daughter, Tatyana B. Dyachenko, and former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais for convincing him that shredding the Constitution with an illegal grab for power would backfire. ''Finally, I reversed a decision I had almost already made,'' he writes, and ''became ashamed before those who believed in me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin's memoir is likely to rekindle the debate about his contribution to the democratic process in Russia after the Soviet breakup in 1991 that he helped to engineer. The book includes a number of frank disclosures, including a confession of his weakness for alcohol.</p>
        <p>There are some significant omissions in the book. While Mr. Yeltsin discusses his role in supporting military assaults on rebellious Chechnya in 1994 and again in 1999, the book contains only a cursory discussion of the origins of the conflict, in which Mr. Yeltsin fails to engage those critics who argue that he missed chances to avert through negotiation the civil war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and has displaced hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin pays scant heed to the rampant corruption and crony capitalism that marked his rule. He blames corruption on the low pay of Russian bureaucrats managing multimillion-dollar industries, and on the ingrained habit of ''paying under the table.''</p>
        <p>As for the corruption investigation that has come closest to his family, involving the Swiss construction company Mabatex, which is engaged in the renovation of the Kremlin, Mr. Yeltsin says that neither he nor any member of his family has taken kickbacks. He lists his assets at a little more than $300,000 in cash, plus an apartment and a country house on 10 acres outside Moscow.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Yeltsin does not describe himself as an alcoholic, he confesses in the book to a compulsion to drink when under pressure, a compulsion he says he overcame to a great extent after his heart attack and by-pass operation in 1996.</p>
        <p>''Fairly early on I concluded that alcohol was the only means quickly to get rid of stress,'' he says, recounting an embarrassing episode in 1994, when during a visit to Berlin, a tipsy Yeltsin tried to conduct a military orchestra.</p>
        <p>The 400-page book, ''Midnight Diaries,'' is being published this month by PublicAffairs. Excerpts will appear in Newsweek magazine, and the Russian journal Argumenty i Fakty has already published a lengthy extract.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin writes that he determined as early as March 1999 that the best candidate to succeed him was a little-known former K.G.B. officer, Vladimir V. Putin, who at that time was running Russia's Federal Security Service.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Yeltsin writes, he appointed Sergei V. Stepashin as a ''decoy'' prime minister for three months because Mr. Yeltsin feared that the departing prime minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, who disliked Mr. Putin, would mount a campaign to undermine him. If true, this maneuver is typical of the wile that Mr. Yeltsin often displayed in staying on top of Russia's power politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Primakov , also a former intelligence chief, ''had tremendous political reserves,'' Mr. Yeltsin says, ''but his rule threatened to roll back reforms, collapse the embryonic economic freedoms, and trample the democratic liberties that we had managed to nurture and preserve in these past few years.''</p>
        <p>He described Mr. Primakov as an ''old Soviet type'' who kept a ''special file'' on journalists and other critics. ''Every clipping was carefully underlined with colored pencils,'' Mr. Yeltsin recounts. ''I couldn't believe my eyes,'' he adds, saying Mr. Primakov had ''too much red in his political palette,'' who could not read the newspaper without suspecting ''complicated intrigues, subtexts or threats from his political opponents.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin says he realized that Russia needed a younger face -- Mr. Putin is 48 -- while playing a computer game with his grandson Borya. ''I know that youth is not a panacea,'' he said, for ''there are 40-year-olds with totalitarian natures,'' but youth was an essential criterion in choosing Mr. Putin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's star rose in Mr. Yeltsin's eyes not only because he was willing to go on the attack in Chechnya but also because he was willing to circumvent the law when his mentor, the former St. Petersburg mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, was under criminal investigation in 1998. Mr. Putin considered the case against Mr. Sobchak politically motivated.</p>
        <p>''Using his connections in St. Petersburg, Putin made a deal with a private airline and brought Sobchak out to Finland. From there, Sobchak made his way to Paris,'' where he lived until Mr. Putin's rise made it possible for him to return to Russia last year. He died in February.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's covert operation to smuggle the ailing Mr. Sobchak out of the country was of questionable legality and was done without Mr. Yeltsin's knowledge or approval, but ''when I learned what Putin had done, I felt a profound sense of respect and gratitude toward him,'' Mr. Yeltsin says.</p>
        <p>The first decree issued by Mr. Putin after his stunning appointment last Dec. 31 as acting president guaranteed Mr. Yeltsin immunity from prosecution after he left office.</p>
