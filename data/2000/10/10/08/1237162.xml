        <p>When he was arrested by the Mexican government this week, a Cuban spy on the run from his government was carrying a document, parts of which were made public today, in which he outlined his career running operations against the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
        <p>The Cuban official, Pedro Riera Escalante, who was summarily deported by Mexico to Havana on Wednesday, served under cover as the Cuban consul here from 1986 through 1991. In the document, he described Cuban espionage operations against the C.I.A. station in Mexico City and other operations he ran in Europe and Africa.</p>
        <p>His deportation ended his month-long effort to win political asylum in Mexico.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riera, who had become deeply disillusioned with his president, Fidel Castro, also spoke about his intelligence work in general terms in conversations with The New York Times, with Mexican foreign relations and national security officials with whom he discussed asylum and with human rights advocates who helped him petition for refuge.</p>
        <p>In the document, excerpts of which were published by the Mexico City newspaper Reforma on Friday, Mr. Riera said that he had recruited scores of Mexican informants, including officials, businessmen, intelligence officers and journalists.</p>
        <p>Among the successes he claimed was a 1989 operation, code-named ''Lupa,'' or ''Magnifying Glass,'' in which he said he obtained the correspondence of recruited C.I.A. agents in Mexico. Another operation was code-named ''Moncada,'' in which he said he used a renegade C.I.A. officer, Philip Agee, to try to recruit the secretary of the deputy chief of the C.I.A. station in Mexico City. United States intelligence officials have described the operation as a total failure, saying Mr. Agee, who broke publicly with the C.I.A. in the 1970's and is regarded by the agency as a traitor, was quickly identified, and his approach rebuffed. Mr. Agee did not return an e-mail sent to his office in Cuba on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riera said he had worked with Mr. Agee for years. He said the work began in 1973, when he was a liaison between Mr. Agee and the Cuban Politburo, when Mr. Agee was writing a book exposing C.I.A. secrets. Mr. Riera said that he conveyed suggestions from the government about what information Mr. Agee should disclose in his book. He said telephone numbers for C.I.A. officials in the United States Embassy in Mexico City provided by Mr. Agee proved useful to Cuba years later, when Mr. Riera was posted here, helping him identify which embassy personnel were C.I.A. officers.</p>
        <p>United States officials have not commented on Mr. Riera's case, other than a statement from the American Embassy in Mexico City expressing concern about his fate in Cuba.</p>
        <p>After a number of overseas assignments, including one in 1977 in which he said he persuaded President Samora Machel to throw C.I.A. personnel out of Mozambique, Mr. Riera said he was assigned by his bosses in Cuba's General Directorate of Intelligence to draw up a manual to instruct Cuban spies about how best to infiltrate the C.I.A.</p>
        <p>The manual, ''Methodology for Recruitment of C.I.A. Staff Personnel,'' became a standard training tool for Cuban agents, he said. It demanded personal and psychological profiles of potential recruits to pinpoint weaknesses and vulnerabilities. And it advised using money, not ideology, to lure C.I.A. personnel into collaborating.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riera was proud of what he regarded as highly effective work by Cuban intelligence against the C.I.A. during his service. He accused Mr. Castro of destroying the Cuban agency by turning it to his political ends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riera, who is 49, joined the Cuban directorate as a teenager in 1969, the documents show. He was recalled to Cuba in 1992 and stepped down from active duty a year later, with the rank of major. He remains on reserve.</p>
        <p>In conversations with The Times, Mr. Riera said that he did not want to seek exile in the United States, but hoped for safe haven in Mexico. Reuters reported today from Havana that Mr. Riera was back in Cuba but his whereabouts were not known.</p>
        <p>Mexican officials gave conflicting accounts about Mr. Riera's deportation. The Foreign Ministry confirmed that two senior officials there met with Mr. Riera in recent weeks to hear his safe haven request. Foreign Minister Rosario Green said through her spokesman that she turned the matter over to the Interior Ministry, which handles both national security and immigration.</p>
        <p>But Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, the Interior Ministry's top official for immigration, said today that he had heard nothing about Mr. Riera from the Foreign Ministry and had no record of an asylum request. He said Mr. Riera was deported because he did not produce a valid Mexican visa.</p>
