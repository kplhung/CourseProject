        <p>THE annual sculpture exhibitions at Storm King Art Center here have customarily featured works that are quite different from their setting, like most of the permanent works, which are angular and metal, set on and against the rolling fields that are especially green right now. The special exhibition this year is markedly different from its predecessors because it makes ample use of natural materials found on the Storm King property.</p>
        <p>This shift was brought about by Andy Goldsworthy, a British sculptor who has been working at Storm King for three years. That span of time was necessary to realize his opus, merrily titled, ''Wall that went for a walk.'' (A prosaic alternative title is ''Storm King Wall.'' The wall is 2,278 feet long and made of 1,579 tons of field stones, including a fallen-down farm wall on the site, but its inherent heaviness is belied by its jauntiness as it crosses a road, winds around trees and plunges into a pond. At least it gives the illusion of plunging. It really ends at the water's edge. It then seems to emerge from the pond and head across a field that borders the New York Thruway. It's undeniably a grand creation: the wall, though low, makes its mark as being as relentless as the Great Wall of China.</p>

        <p>THE annual sculpture exhibitions at Storm King Art Center here have customarily featured works that are quite different from their setting, like most of the permanent works, which are angular and metal, set on and against the rolling fields that are especially green right now. The special exhibition this year is markedly different from its predecessors because it makes ample use of natural materials found on the Storm King property.</p>
        <p>This shift was brought about by Andy Goldsworthy, a British sculptor who has been working at Storm King for three years. That span of time was necessary to realize his opus, merrily titled, ''Wall that went for a walk.'' (A prosaic alternative title is ''Storm King Wall.'' The wall is 2,278 feet long and made of 1,579 tons of field stones, including a fallen-down farm wall on the site, but its inherent heaviness is belied by its jauntiness as it crosses a road, winds around trees and plunges into a pond. At least it gives the illusion of plunging. It really ends at the water's edge. It then seems to emerge from the pond and head across a field that borders the New York Thruway. It's undeniably a grand creation: the wall, though low, makes its mark as being as relentless as the Great Wall of China.</p>
        <p>That the wall seeks a highway is fitting because Mr. Goldsworthy is known for working in remote corners of the world, including Antarctica. Most people won't see his actual projects, so he resourcefully photographs them, and the photographs -- many of them large scale -- are works of art in their own right.</p>
        <p>The indoor part of his exhibition contains many lush, color photographs, records of temporal events. An engaging videotape featuring Mr. Goldsworthy at work, and talking amiably while working, plays in one room of the gallery. In it he points out that he basically makes two kinds of works, the meticulous, durable work like ''Storm King Wall'' over which he has full control and works that depend on the vagaries of nature.</p>
        <p>One of the ephemeral activities he's engaged in on the videotape is applying bright yellow autumn leaves to a tree trunk, fitting the leaves into the natural depressions of the bark. In a related action, a photograph shows a rock whose face is marked by a large rectangle of leaves, which are affixed by water. As the rectangle of leaves was made ''for the morning sun,'' as Mr. Goldsworthy says, when the water dries, the leaves fall off. Mr. Goldsworthy takes pictures of the bark before he applies the leaves, then again when the leaves are at their peak and, finally, again when the leaves slip off the tree trunk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldsworthy uses autumn leaves as they are found. But in several photographs a concerted round form, something like a target, composed of many bright leaves, seems unnatural, alien in fact. A circle of red and yellow sumac leaves laid around a hole has the look of the landscape having been scorched by something now vanished.</p>
        <p>Most often, though, there is no such subtext, and works involving rocks and colored  leaves have the matter-of-fact quality of Minimal Art, whose point is often the revelation of the artistic process used in its making. For example, in the early morning (using a similar process to plastering the bark with leaves), Mr. Goldsworthy covers rocks with leaves of a uniform color -- red in one work, green in another -- leaving uncovered a round depression on top of the rocks. In his text, Mr. Goldsworthy remarked that when he returned later in the day the leaves were slipping off the rocks. He then gathered the leaves and lined the indentations of the rocks with them. Three photographs of these rocks reveal the action of nature and are an exercise in pure design. He also effects smaller designs with blades of grass.</p>
        <p>The wall is supremely serpentine, and the roots of some trees in photographs echo the  wall's pattern. But most surprising is seeing that the extreme snakiness also appears indoors.</p>
        <p>The Storm King galleries are part of an elegant building made of granite blocks built as a private residence in 1935. In one room with chandeliers, Mr. Goldsworthy,  rather audaciously, laid down a floor of clay. It's as though at Storm King there's no sanctuary from nature, as paradoxical as that sounds. The strange appearance of a clay floor is alluring, and visitors will stare at it at least long enough to become aware of the now familiar serpentine form, standing out from the random cracking and bisecting of the floor lengthwise. The numerous cracks in the buff-colored clay floor oddly resonate with the raised floral designs around the chandeliers.</p>
        <p>Another example of the interchangeableness of indoors and outdoors is a circular stone enclosure, which starts in the patio and appears to go through the building's French windows to continue inside.</p>
        <p>The invasions don't stop there. One of the exhibition galleries seems to have been commandeered by a large ball composed of sticks knitted together. The sticks were brought over from Scotland, and that pedigree seems to give them an extra ruggedness. At any rate, the ball fills the room forcefully, stopping the viewer at the door. One might think of Magritte's paintings of giant green apples filling rooms.</p>
        <p>A twin ball sits outdoors, sited so that it is seen through the windows of the room with the clay floor. A product of Mr. Goldsworthy's meticulous side, and revealing his deep-seated allegiance to harmony, the ball is lined up with the undulating center of the floor.</p>
        <p>The Goldsworthy exhibition will be at the Storm King Art Center through Nov. 15. Information: (914) 534-3115</p>
