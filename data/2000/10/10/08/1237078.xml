        <p>THE setting was a dinner party on the Upper West Side. The talk turned to a new crime deterrent: a thumb-detonated electronic alarm system being tested on an Upper East Side block starting this month.</p>
        <p>The alarm is to be attached to the key chain of a potential victim, who can press it upon sensing a criminal nearby. A loudspeaker will then issue a warning to the neighbors, accompanied by instructions to call the police; a police siren will sound; and a series of strobe lights will flash. All of this is loud enough and visible enough for everyone on the entire block, 77th Street between Second and Third Avenues, to see and hear. Finally, the alarm would alert the local police station to the address and name of the victim.</p>
        <p>After a two-month test period on 77th Street, the device will be sold citywide, said Richard Soloway, chief executive of Napco Security Systems, which makes it.</p>
        <p>''That's it,'' laughed one dinner guest, an African-American lawyer. He's a big guy whose appearance often prompts purse-clutching and abrupt detours by those in his orbit. ''They finally found a way to drive the brothers out of New York.''</p>
        <p>The lawyer and the other guests enacted a facetious  scene of alarms being set off every time a black or brown person came too close to a nervous panic-button owner or showed up in a building presumed to be all white.</p>
        <p>Nikki Henkin, the founder of the 77th Street Block Association, said she understood the concerns about that kind of racial profiling. But, she said, the alarm system will be taken away from anyone who misuses it.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to have anything that would trigger a negative racist approach,'' is how Ms. Henkin put it. ''There is a way to stop people who abuse the system.''</p>
        <p>Her neighborhood has historically been quite safe, but has been plagued by a serial rapist in recent years. Mr. Soloway said his company was also talking with the Police Department about possibly installing the alarm system in a high-crime area, like the Red Hook or East New York sections of Brooklyn. They also happen to be mostly nonwhite neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>If the dinner guests' fears of unwarranted racial panic on the Upper East Side seem a bit over the top, chalk it up to wages of historical discrimination. The lawyer and his friends do not trust that strangers will see them for who they are because, too often, even their own neighbors do not.</p>
        <p>It is one thing to be ignored by taxi drivers and sales clerks or to get too much attention from the police. But almost any black or brown professional in the city has stories closer to home.</p>
        <p>They talk about repeated assumptions by their middle-class and upper-middle-class white neighbors that they lack the same status. They are too often seen as strangers or service providers and not just another face down the hall. The assumptions about them are not made just on the Upper East Side, either, but here, there and all around the town.</p>
        <p>A black couple who live in Greenwich Village -- she's a college professor and he's a banker -- had several stories. A favorite is the time a neighbor poked his head out his door and asked if the husband, dressed in a suit and tie and toting a briefcase, was delivering groceries.</p>
        <p>Such behavior usually comes on more subtle feet. The wife recalled the morning she ran into a colleague, who also happened to be a neighbor, and he stuttered, ''What are you doing in this neighborhood?'' His voice conveyed neither delight nor surprise, she said, but a sense that something was terribly wrong.</p>
        <p>In a Murray Hill building, a Puerto Rican teacher (another suit) said he was constantly approached by neighbors who want him to fix something. When he says, ''I just live here,'' the most common response is a startled, ''Oh.'' But one neighbor memorably replied: ''Oh, you're 24 hours then. Just knock on my door anytime.''</p>
        <p>A black historian using the laundry room of her building near Columbia University was asked by another woman in the building, without preamble, if she was the maid for the white man with whom she lived.</p>
        <p>Over on the Upper East Side, a black advertising executive who was loading and folding on her housekeeper's day off was asked if she ''had any extra hours'' to do the neighbor's laundry, too.</p>
        <p>A black newspaper reporter who lives on the Upper West Side offered to help a neighbor find a nanny, after chatting with him on the elevator and indicating where she lived. The next night, he knocked on her door and asked her husband if she was looking for a job as a nanny.</p>
        <p>The stories go on and on. Just when one assumes it's safe to be melanin-rich and comfortable, the figurative mop or baby appears.</p>
        <p>The examples of racial myopia happen too often to too many people for them all to be dismissed as honest mistakes. It is racial stereotyping in full tilt.</p>
        <p>A lot of looking without seeing and hearing without listening is still going on.</p>
