        <p>It was a memorable day at Belmont Park yesterday for Jean-Luc Samyn, the 43-year-old jockey: he rode the winners of both Grade I stakes, the Flower Bowl Invitational and the Turf Classic Invitational, each worth $750,000 plus the inside track on this year's turf championships.</p>
        <p>But it turned into an even bigger day for John's Call, the 9-year-old warrior, who led every step of the mile-and-a-half Turf Classic and outran stars from Europe and America half his age. It was his sixth success in his last eight starts, and the 15th of his career. He also became the oldest horse to win the race since John Henry did it at 9 in 1984.</p>

        <p>It was a memorable day at Belmont Park yesterday for Jean-Luc Samyn, the 43-year-old jockey: he rode the winners of both Grade I stakes, the Flower Bowl Invitational and the Turf Classic Invitational, each worth $750,000 plus the inside track on this year's turf championships.</p>
        <p>But it turned into an even bigger day for John's Call, the 9-year-old warrior, who led every step of the mile-and-a-half Turf Classic and outran stars from Europe and America half his age. It was his sixth success in his last eight starts, and the 15th of his career. He also became the oldest horse to win the race since John Henry did it at 9 in 1984.</p>
        <p>He almost ran out of gas in the homestretch but still had half a length on Craigsteel of Britain at the finish, with Ela Athena third and the favored Fantastic Light fourth.</p>
        <p>''This is the ultimate thrill,'' Samyn said, basking in his doubleheader. ''John's Call ran his race, just like he always does. This horse is something special.''</p>
        <p>Tom Voss, who trains John's Call for the Trillium Stable, agreed. ''When he gets to the top of the stretch,'' he said, ''he just accelerates. He is a genuine stayer.''</p>
        <p>John's Call, a gelding, ran the mile and a half in 2:282/5  after setting a slow pace, and paid $22.80 for a $2 bet to win. He went home with $450,000, running his career earnings past $1 million.</p>
        <p>The first of the two marquee events, the Flower Bowl Invitational, ended with high drama when the long shot Colstar made a tremendous dash through the late homestretch to overtake Snow Polina by a head.</p>
        <p>Colstar came into the race with two defeats in her last two races, following a winning streak of four. But she still was considered no match for the two favorites, Snow Polina and Happyanunoit, who finished 1-2, respectively, in the Beverly D at Arlington Park in August. She upset the odds, though, when Samyn nudged her into a furious dash that cut down a five-length lead built by Snow Polina that was erased in the final stride. Pico Teneriffe beat out Happyanunoit for third place by a head.</p>
        <p>Colstar, trained by Paul Fout, ran the mile and a quarter on the turf in 2:01 3/5  and returned $17 for a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>In the third stakes of the day, the Gallant Bloom, a virtuoso performance was recorded by Dream Supreme, the 3-year-old filly owned by George Steinbrenner and trained by Bill Mott. She had won two Grade I stakes at Saratoga in her previous two races, and she kept her career record in a championship glow by winning for the sixth time in eight starts.</p>
        <p>Dream Supreme ran the six and a half furlongs under Pat Day in 1:15 4/5 , crossed the wire two lengths in front of the late-closing Finder's Fee, with Tropical Punch third.</p>
        <p>After the race, Steinbrenner left for Yankee Stadium for last night's game between his Yankees and the Oakland Athletics.</p>
        <p>''As long as you've got Torre and Mott,'' he said of Yankees Manager Joe Torre, ''you don't need much else.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>The countdown intensifies for the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup on Saturday at Belmont. Lemon Drop Kid, the leading candidate for Horse of the Year, breezed six furlongs in 47 2/5  seconds under GEORGE MARTENS, his exercise rider, then galloped out five furlongs in 1:00 flat and six furlongs in 1:13. . . . Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Jerome, trotted at Belmont and remained a possible starter for the Gold Cup en route to the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4. ''He looks well,'' his trainer, NEIL DRYSDALE, said. ''The little weight he lost from the Jerome, he looks to have gained back. We're hoping to run in the Gold Cup, but I want to leave our options open. He doesn't have to run in another race before the Breeders' Cup.'' . . . And Albert the Great, third in the Jerome and also aiming for the Breeders' Cup Classic, will breeze an easy five-eighths of a mile tomorrow. NICK ZITO, his trainer, affirmed that the 3-year-old colt would run Saturday in the Gold Cup, adding, ''I hope he is strong enough mentally to handle that race.''</p>
