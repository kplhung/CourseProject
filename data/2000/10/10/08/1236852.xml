        <p>COMPLICATED WOMEN</p>
        <p>Sex and Power in Pre-Code Hollywood.</p>
        <p>By Mick LaSalle.</p>
        <p>Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $25.95.</p>
        <p>The late 1920's and early 30's were a glorious era in Hollywood for actresses like Barbara Stanwyck, Miriam Hopkins and Ruth Chatterton. They rejected the images of the vamp and the household saint of the silent era and introduced a new female sensibility -- ambitious, actively employed, self-reliant and sexually experienced. Mick LaSalle's ''Complicated Women'' celebrates the period and documents its destruction at the hands of the Production Code Administration, which in 1934 began enforcing a stringent set of rules for film content. The code's tenets forbade, among other things, sympathetic depictions of adultery and unwed motherhood, and strongly discouraged displays of physical contact and the notion of career women. LaSalle also seeks to redress the reputation of Norma Shearer, whom he regards as the unsung heroine of the era before the code. Shearer is perhaps best remembered for the dutiful wife she played in ''The Women'' (1939), but she repeatedly portrayed independent women in films like ''The Divorcee'' (1930) and ''The Trial of Mary Dugan'' (1929). La Salle, the film critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, has an avuncular but informative style, and makes his points with a relaxed economy. After decades of neglect (many pre-code films were rarely shown on television because of their provocative content), such movies have gained a new following at film festivals. ''Complicated Women,'' an overdue examination of a historic conflict between Hollywood and would-be monitors of morality, should only enhance their resurrection.</p>
