        <p>Cole Porter Hits</p>
        <p>''Red, Hot and Blue!'' the 1936 Cole Porter musical with a book by Russell Crouse and Howard Lindsay opens at the Goodspeed Opera House on Route 82 in East Haddam on Friday, and runs through Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>Across the street at the East Haddam Town Hall annex, a Smithsonian exhibition called ''Red, Hot and Blue: A Salute to American Musicals'' will also open on Friday; it will remain through Dec. 17.</p>
        <p>Ethel Merman, Bob Hope and Jimmy Durante starred in the original show, introducing some of Porter's hits, including ''It's De-Lovely'' and ''Ridin' High.'' A revised book by Michael Leeds supports the introduction of an array of Porter classics that were not in the original show.</p>
        <p>Curtain times are Wednesday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30, Friday at 8, Saturday at 4 and 8:30 and Sunday at 2 and 6:30. Tickets priced from $20 to $42 may be reserved by calling (860) 873-8668.</p>
        <p>One hour before every performance the exhibition will be open to the public, whether or not they attend a performance. Admission is free but donations will be welcome. The display traces the development of the musical through five periods, beginning in the late 19th century with Tin Pan Alley, Lillian Russell and Sophie Tucker, moving along with Al Jolson, Fanny Brice, Eddie Cantor, Florenz Ziegfeld and Jerome Kern's ''Showboat.''</p>
        <p>Hollywood came into the picture in 1927 with Jolson's film ''The Jazz Singer,'' followed by ''42nd Street,'' the ''Golddiggers'' series and the Astaire-Rogers partnership. After World War II the country longed for hometown America and got it in ''Meet Me in St. Louis,'' ''Oklahoma'' and ''The Music Man,'' with ''Guys and Dolls'' and ''West Side Story'' adding some 50's urban grit. The final period from the upheaval of the 60's to the present saw the end of movie musicals and a Broadway perspective that had changed radically with ''Hair'' and ''A Chorus Line.''</p>
        <p>School of London</p>
        <p>A panel discussion will mark the opening on Wednesday of ''The School of London and Their Friends,'' the first public exhibition of a collection of post-World War II British art collected by Elaine and Melvin Merians of New York City. It may be seen at the Yale Center for British Art, 1080 Chapel Street in New Haven through Jan. 7.</p>
        <p>The panel, scheduled to begin at 5:15, will include discussion of the work of Lucian Freud, Leon Kosoff, Frank Auerbach, Michael Andrews, Euan Uglow and R. B. Kitaj, an American-born member of the group who coined the term School of London. A younger generation that reflects its influence and is represented in the more than 70 paintings and drawings includes Christopher Bramham, Peter Doig and Tony Bevan. Serving on the panel are Richard Cork, chief art critic for The Times of London; Stephen Deuchar, director of the Tate Gallery in London; and the painter and critic Andrew Forge.</p>
        <p>Additional events associated with the exhibition include a talk on Oct. 18 by Paula Rego, a London-based artist, and a conversation with Colin St. John Wilson, a British architect and art collector, on Oct. 25. Peter Blake, a postwar British painter once associated with a group of artists that included David Hockney, will conduct the final program on Nov. 1. All three talks are scheduled at 5:15 p.m. Exhibition hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from noon to 5, and admission to the panel and the exhibition is free. The number to call  for recorded information is (203) 432-2800.</p>
        <p>History Lessons</p>
        <p>Donald Malcarne, a historian in Essex, will relate the tale of ''The British Attack on Essex: A Forgotten Page in History'' on Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Connecticut River Museum at the foot of Main Street.</p>
        <p>While history may have forgotten the incident, the town of Essex remembers it well each spring when it holds the Losers' Day Parade, commemorating the 14th of April, 1814, when the British raided Essex Harbor and burned 28 ships, the worst American loss in the War of 1812. Admission is $9. Call (860) 767-8269 for more information.</p>
        <p>David Macaulay Books</p>
        <p>An exhibition on view at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville through Oct. 23 deals with the development of several books by David Macaulay, the Englishman who became an American citizen in 1977, having won numerous honors for his work since moving here in 1956. He writes his books -- all of them quite large, with the flair of a novelist and illustrates them with the precision of an architect and the artistry of a Renaissance printmaker.</p>
        <p>''Cathedral,'' published in 1973 was a Caldecott Honor book, the first of many such awards. ''The Way Things Work,'' published in 1988, and ''The New Way Things Work,'' released last year, are indicative of the discipline to which he applies himself -- how buildings are conceived, engineered and built.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is mounted to simulate an artist's studio, filled with sketches, storyboards, notes and preparatory drawings, all leading up to the final product and publication.</p>
        <p>The school is at 11 Interlaken Road and its Tremaine Gallery is open on Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday from noon to 4. The number to call for more information is (860) 435-2591.</p>
        <p>Old Stone Church</p>
        <p>The publication of a a 205-page history of the 226-year-old Old Stone Church at 251 Main Street in East Haven, will be celebrated at a reception today in the church library from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
        <p>The author of the history is Helen S. Hasse, 91 years old and a parishioner for 75 years. Mrs. Hasse has combined extensive research with her memories of fellow church members, special events and relationships with the community, to produce a rich church history.</p>
        <p>Stories of Sunday School picnics, Blue Laws, trolley cars, building projects and Christmas fairs are covered as well as women's changing roles, and a series of renovations along with the church's admission to the National Register of Historic Places among many other details.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hasse will attend the reception today and sign copies. The book, priced at $20 and titled ''My Ninety Years in Church and Town,'' will also be available at the church fair on Saturday from 9 to 3.</p>
        <p>Fishing in Watercolor</p>
        <p>James Prosek, known as the John James Audubon of fishing for the accuracy and delicacy of his piscatorial watercolors (originals selling for up to $7,000), is a best-selling author of books on fishing that he illustrates with his paintings. His ''Trout: An Illustrated History'' and ''The Complete Angler'' were published while he was an undergraduate at Yale.</p>
        <p>Now, at the age of 25, he has expanded his horizon in a new book ''Early Love and Brook Trout,'' a memoir in paintings and essays of his first love, his days at Yale, getting caught poaching, and the joys of casting for brook trout.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prosek will be at the Greenwich Workshop Gallery, 1657 Post Road in Fairfield today from 3 to 5 p.m. for book signing and conversation.</p>
