        <p>Every public opinion poll suggests that the Bush-Cheney ticket has no more loyal supporters than the millions of men and women of faith who care about family and life issues.

        <p>In both cases, the ticket I strongly support has missed an opportunity to speak for these Americans, who are deeply troubled by the undermining of this sanctity and by the attack on the institution of marriage between a man and a woman.</p>

        <p>Every public opinion poll suggests that the Bush-Cheney ticket has no more loyal supporters than the millions of men and women of faith who care about family and life issues. How surprising, then, that those voters have had their hearts broken in two consecutive debates, as they watched first a lackluster defense of the sanctity of life, and then a surrender on the defense of traditional marriage.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the ticket I strongly support has missed an opportunity to speak for these Americans, who are deeply troubled by the undermining of this sanctity and by the attack on the institution of marriage between a man and a woman.</p>
        <p>Even more puzzling is why there is so much confusion on the part of the G.O.P. ticket on fundamental questions that most define the differences between the two parties. In last week's vice presidential debate, Dick Cheney, essentially agreeing with Joseph Lieberman, said that people should be ''free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into'' and that ''states are likely to come to different conclusions'' on whether same-sex marriages should be recognized. He summed up by saying, ''I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into.''</p>
        <p>I can say with certainty that the delegates who nominated Mr. Cheney and the many voters who support him overwhelmingly disagree with that. This view, embraced by both vice presidential candidates, is wrong -- and out of step with the beliefs of the many Americans who consider marriage to be a God-ordained institution between a man and a woman.</p>
        <p>The last 30 years have been a social disaster largely because people have felt free to enter into -- or leave -- any relationship they wanted. The result has been abandoned women and children, births out of wedlock and fatherless children.  Children need a mother and a father. Marriage must be preserved as an institution intended to bring a man and woman together. It is not hateful or exclusionary to say these things.</p>
        <p>On the sanctity of life, too, the debates have provided virtually no solace for those who believe, as so many do, that all children must be welcomed into the world and protected under law. The next president should review the clearance of RU-486 by the Food and Drug Administration. And the Republican party must appoint judges who will respect life and insure a place at the table for all children -- born and unborn.</p>
        <p>I doubt if anyone wants an end to the Clinton-Gore era more than I do. I will continue, as I have for months, to promote the Bush-Cheney ticket. I favor lower taxes across the board, a stronger national defense and less Washington bureaucracy and red tape.</p>
        <p>But all of those things pale in comparison to the fundamental question of tempering our liberty with virtue.  Unless we make that case more effectively, we risk demoralizing millions of good Americans worried about cultural and moral decline and sentencing our country to four more years like the last eight.</p>
