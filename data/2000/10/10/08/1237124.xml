        <p>EARLY this year, when Vice President Al Gore was ostensibly under the stylistic tutelage of the writer Naomi ''release-your-inner-alpha-male'' Wolf, he showed up in New Hampshire for a primary debate with Bill Bradley looking more like someone trying to sign Minnie Driver to a three-picture deal than a politician aiming to lead the free world. On Jan. 26, Mr. Gore wore a snug three-button suit that wasn't quite dark enough, a shirt of French blue that appeared at once too French and too blue, and a horizontally striped tie. The look brought a rejoinder from DNR, the men's wear trade journal, deploring ''fashion offenses bordering on the impeachable.''</p>
        <p>DNR made much of the fact that the vice president had buttoned the top button of his jacket. But the real transgression was his stab at flashiness, which his rivals in the Democratic primary seized on as cause for optimism.

''He could look natty, and natty isn't presidential.''</p>

        <p>EARLY this year, when Vice President Al Gore was ostensibly under the stylistic tutelage of the writer Naomi ''release-your-inner-alpha-male'' Wolf, he showed up in New Hampshire for a primary debate with Bill Bradley looking more like someone trying to sign Minnie Driver to a three-picture deal than a politician aiming to lead the free world. On Jan. 26, Mr. Gore wore a snug three-button suit that wasn't quite dark enough, a shirt of French blue that appeared at once too French and too blue, and a horizontally striped tie. The look brought a rejoinder from DNR, the men's wear trade journal, deploring ''fashion offenses bordering on the impeachable.''</p>
        <p>DNR made much of the fact that the vice president had buttoned the top button of his jacket. But the real transgression was his stab at flashiness, which his rivals in the Democratic primary seized on as cause for optimism. ''One of the things we thought Bradley had going for him was that Gore was too fashion-forward,'' said Richard Stengel, one of Mr. Bradley's consultants at the time. ''He could look natty, and natty isn't presidential.''</p>
        <p>Of all the critiques one might make of the performance Mr. Gore and his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, gave on Tuesday in the first presidential debate -- overuse of the terms ''lockbox'' and ''fuzzy math,'' for example -- nattiness isn't one of them.</p>
        <p>Both candidates arrived at the University of Massachusetts in Boston looking more or less as if they had prepared for the debate in neighboring rooms at the Harvard Club. Both wore dark suits, white shirts and that traditional power symbol, the solid red tie. They almost made Senator Joseph Lieberman and former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who went head-to-head two days later, look positively GQ-ish. Mr. Cheney went so far as to wear a shirt of muted blue.</p>
        <p>Were Vice President Gore and Governor Bush playing it too safe in this tightly contested race? Were they afraid that anything veering from the mundane would send voters on the fence fleeing in the wrong direction? ''The tie shouldn't be too distracting,'' said Michael Deaver, the former adviser to President Ronald Reagan (a radical proponent of brown suits), commenting on the unwritten rules of debate wear. ''But it doesn't have to be quite as boring as solid red.''</p>
        <p>For anyone who has a hard time deciphering exactly how the candidates differ on Social Security reform and mandatory testing, for anyone who believes that the two privileged, middle-aged sons of powerful political families are more alike than opposite, the sartorial display on Tuesday probably wasn't decisive.  As the fashion designer John Bartlett, who watched the debates from a hotel room in Paris, observed of the candidates: ''They both looked exactly the same, which I think is a reflection of how the Republican Party is trying to look Democratic and somehow the Democratic Party is becoming more Republican. They're mirroring each other and merging into one thing.''</p>
        <p>All that said, to students of men's fashion, namely those able to identify hopsacking in a line-up, there were key differences. ''Men's wear is all about the nuances,'' said Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. ''They looked the same, but in terms of what the clothing means, they're worlds apart.'' Vice President Gore wore a three-button suit, and his shoulders were softer, connoting more of a European sensibility than the governor's stiffer two-button affair.</p>
        <p>''They both looked like flight attendants,'' Mr. Doonan said, ''but one of them was flying Alitalia.''</p>
        <p>Please note, also, that the spread between the points of the vice president's shirt collar was far narrower than the one on Governor Bush. The governor's ''modified spread'' is generally considered a more conservative look.</p>
        <p>And then there is the controversial matter of cuff links: the vice president avoided them, Governor Bush did not. ''Democratic candidates can't wear cuff links,'' Mr. Stengel pointed out. ''It looks too luxe, too country club, too 1-percent-ish.''</p>
        <p>It's interesting to note that four years ago, when presidential candidates weren't bragging about how much they loved their wives, debate wear was comparatively racier. In an Oct. 16, 1996, face-off in San Diego, President Clinton sported a deep red and blue rep tie, while Senator Bob Dole, future Viagra advocate, wore an elaborate-patterned one.</p>
        <p>Late-night talk show hosts will surely miss the Clinton presidency. But stylists, too, are likely to experience melancholy.</p>
