      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Weeks before the 1980 Republican convention, Ronald Reagan asked me to vet the people he was considering for vice president. This occurred at a meeting in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria. William Casey, campaign chairman, and Edwin Meese were also there. I remember Reagan saying how dismayed he had been by the spectacle of the parade of candidates to Plains, Ga., in 1976. He said that he wanted the process carried out with the greatest confidentiality.</p>
        <p>At the convention, I was asked to recheck several items concerning Bush, and I met with him and James Baker in Bush's hotel room. Bush was the only one I reviewed in detail with Reagan before he made the telephone call that was pictured in your article, a call that I listened to from the photographer's side of the table.</p>
