        <p>Almost like magic, sometime in late September, Tokyo is transformed from one of the world's muggiest, most miserable cities to a walker's paradise.</p>
        <p>The old joke holds that during the long summer months, Tokyo is a place where one can walk and swim at the same time. But with the passing of the season's typhoons, dry winds bringing a crisp freshness.</p>
        <p>For those with a choice, fall and spring are the only times to visit this huge and elusive city. Spring is famous for its cherry blossoms, but fall is no less celebrated for that other characteristic Japanese flower, the chrysanthemum, which blooms in October and was made famous by its use on Japan's imperial seal. And with temperatures in the 70's, Tokyo's denizens flock to the city's major parks to view the blossoms, whose varieties range from huge, specially bred solitary flowers to bonsai miniatures and flowing trains of smaller flowers that repose on wooden frames.</p>
        <p>A word about navigation: Tokyo streets often bear no names, and the city's address system is incomprehensible even to many longtime residents. Fortunately, the subway is among the world's best, and -- for about $1.80, typically, at 106.5 yen to the dollar -- will bring you to virtually any neighborhood. English maps are available in every station, and English signs abound. When you reach the station nearest your destination, just show the address to a taxi driver (preferably in Japanese; few drivers speak English). Also know the Japanese name and address of your hotel -- carrying one of its matchbooks should do the trick.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The first of the season's major chrysanthemum exhibitions is at Yasukuni Shrine, 3-1-1 Kudan-kita in Chiyoda-yu, a major Shinto center just north of the Imperial Palace, from Oct. 16 to Nov. 5. Five buildings are given over to flower displays, and the shrine shows 50 new arrangements each day. There are also daily performances of traditional dance and music from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. It's near the Kudanshita Station of the Tozai Subway. Information: (81-3) 3261-8326.</p>
        <p>Another Yasukuni Shrine highlight, albeit a one-day wonder, is the Oct. 10 performance of kusajishishiki, traditional archery that dates from the 12th century. Thirty costumed archers will give hourlong performances at 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. All shrine events are free.</p>
        <p>The other great destination for chrysanthemum fans is Meiji Shrine Park. Amid the 178 acres of serene, thick woods are winding paths and an austere shrine to the Emperor Meiji (1868-1912), whose modernizing reign coincided with the end of Japan's long isolation. The shrine's giant cedar gate, or torii, at 36 feet high, is the largest in the country. The shrine's chrysanthemum exhibition, also free, takes place Oct. 25 to Nov. 23, and like Yasukuni's, features ever-changing arrangements and varieties. It's near the Harajuku Station on the JR Yamanote Line.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 29 and 31, free performances of gagaku dances, a slow-moving specatacle of flowing, colorful robes, will be staged in the park at 11 a.m. In this setting, the music, reedy and hypnotic, can induce a trance.</p>
        <p>October is Kabuki season at the Kabukiza, 4-12-15 Ginza, Chuo-ku, (81-3) 5565-6000. The highly popular traditional plays run from Oct. 1 to 25, with four ''stories'' a day from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 4:30 to 9 p.m. The theater, a grand, Chinese-inspired building, is at the Higashi Ginza exit on the Hibiya Line. Tickets are $22.50 to $131. Headphones for English translations are available.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Tokyo, so imposing and impersonal from a distance, readily dissolves upon closer approach. Including Yokohama and other nearby cities, this megalopolis is home to over 20 million people. But Tokyo is a huge collection of neighborhoods, each built on a human, often charming, scale, perfect for exploration on foot. Some of the best starting points are near the Meiji Shrine.</p>
        <p>Harajuku, abutting the shrine's south entrance, is overflowing with boutiques that draw Japanese teenagers -- a fact evident as soon as you get off the JR Yamanote train at Harajuku Station. The pedestrian overpass leading to the shrine is the center of a gothic fashion scene, with clusters of teenagers in outfits that look as if they were inspired by the Addams family. Posing for pictures with them has become a popular activity for tourists.</p>
        <p>Beyond this ghoulish gallery, Harajuku is Tokyo at its Paris-like best. The Omotesando-dori, a main avenue, is shaded by old trees and lined with cafes and restaurants. Along with the Meiji-dori, another broad boulevard, and the innumerable boutique-laden side streets that radiate from them, it can easily consume an afternoon of strolling.</p>
        <p>The nearby Shibuya district is another walker's paradise. From Harajuku, it is a leisurely 20 minutes or so by foot along Meiji-dori (the JR train makes the trip in a couple of minutes for $1.40). With its huge neon billboards, shimmering towers and crowds of pedestrians, Shibuya conjures up scenes from ''Blade Runner'' -- no accident, since the movie's sets were inspired by this sort of post-modern Tokyo neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Shibuya is the place to see the latest women's fashions on parade. Recently, styles have ranged from boots with soles as thick as a birthday cake to hair dyed blond and skin kept artificially dark -- all highlighted with frosty pink eyeliner and lipstick. For those who like this look, Shibuya 109, a collection of dress shops, fills a cylindrical tower facing the main square, one of the world's busiest pedestrian crosswalks.</p>
        <p>Another great area for a stroll is around Shiba Park (Shiba Koen Station on the Mita Line), home to the 1,092-foot Tokyo Tower. It opened in 1958 and still offers one of the best vantage points of Tokyo's enormous sprawl. Open 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily; the quick ride up costs $7.70, $4.30 for children; (81-3) 3433-5111.</p>
        <p>In Shiba Park itself is the Zojo-ji,  once one of Tokyo's most important Buddhist temples. Nearly all of the 48 temples that once occupied this site have been destroyed by fires or urban encroachment. But Sanmon, a gate built in the 1700's and said to be the oldest wooden structure in the city, still stands. Its three sections represent the stages one must pass through to nirvana. Free; open 6 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>A thoroughly new part of town is Odaiba -- an island built in Tokyo Bay in the 1980's. It has become a big draw in recent years, with amusement parks, futuristic gaming centers and spacious, ultramodern shopping malls, most of them open 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. The most famous of these, Venus Fort, has become a popular place for dates that revolve around luxury shopping and dining. Not all the merchandise is expensive, but don't expect bargains.</p>
        <p>For children, there is the Tokyo Joypolis, a huge arcade run by Sega with life-size versions of its miniature games. Admission is $4.70, $2.80 for children; most games cost $4.70 to $6.60. It is open 10 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.; (81-3) 5500-1801. The island is reached by the Yurikamome monorail from Shimbashi Station.</p>
        <p>Roppongi, a late-night amusement district, caters to Westerners. The Lexington Disco, just off Gaien Higashi-dori, is probably Roppongi's most famous party place, but in this pulsing quarter, the choices are endless. Other spots to look for are House of Chili, (81-3) 3402-0372, and Johnny Rockets, (81-3) 3423-1955, both at Roppongi 3-chome; and Beach, 1-15-1 Nishi Azabu, Minatku-to, (81-3) 3478-8777. Most clubs don't get rolling until after midnight, and many go till dawn. Cover charges range from $23 to $47. Take the Hibya Line to Roppongi Station; from there, you can't miss the neon signs.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The Ginza Tobu Hotel (Renaissance Hotel), (81-3) 3546-0111, fax (81-3) 3546-8990, is in central Tokyo, near the prestigious Ginza shopping district. Its 206 rooms are functional and of moderate size, but the hotel is spotlessly clean and has pleasant service. A double room with breakfast is $245.</p>
        <p>Known for its good restaurants, the 375-room Odakyu Century Southern Tower Hotel, 2-2-1 Yoyogi, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, (81-3) 5354-0111, fax (81-3) 5354-0100, is a 10-minute walk from Yoyogi Park, one of the prettiest in Tokyo, and is convenient to Shibuya, the bustling business and fashion center. This basic business hotel has good-size working areas and charges $205 for a double.</p>
        <p>Budget: The Washington Hotel, 3-2-9 Nishi-Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku; (81-3) 3343-3111, fax (81-3) 3342-2575, has 1,301 simple rooms in its main building and 337 in a new wing. It charges $140 for doubles, with breakfast.</p>
        <p>Rooms with Western or traditional Japanese decor are available at the Atami-sou, 4-14-3 Ginza, Chuo-ku, Tokyo; (81-3) 3541-3621, fax (81-3) 3541-3263. In either case, the 74 rooms are small in this central Ginza business district hotel. Doubles for tatami-mat rooms are $250; with Western furnishings, $185.</p>
        <p>Luxury: Tokyo's most famous hotel may be the 110-year-old Imperial, 1-1-1 Uchisaiwai-cho, Chiyoda-ku, (81-3) 3504-1111, fax (81-3) 3581-9146, with its cavernous Frank Lloyd Wright lobby, luxury boutiques, 1,059 rooms and proliferation of restaurants. Service is impeccable, and its location, across from Hibya Park near the Imperial Palace, is great for morning jogs or afternoon strolls. Doubles are $365 to $460.</p>
        <p>Many business travelers pick the 858-room Hotel Okura, 2-10-4 Toranomon, Minato-ku, (81-3) 3582-0111, fax (81-3) 3582-3707. This big, old, impeccably maintained hotel near the United States Embassy features large rooms and plenty of restaurants and shops. Doubles are $375 or, with a tatami mat, $345.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Goemon, 1-26 Honkomagome, (81-3) 3811-2015, serves traditional tofu cuisine in an old Japanese home. Fixed-menu lunches go for $25 and $33, and dinners $52 to $70; beer or sake is $6.50. The restaurant is in the Bunkyo ward, a short walk from Hakusan Station, on the Mita Line.</p>
        <p>The famous Japanese delicacy  fugu (blowfish), whose organs contain deadly poisons, can be served only by authorized chefs. Tentake, a seafood restaurant at 6-16-6 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, (81-3) 3541-3881, in Tsukiji, Tokyo's fish-market district, is a good place to sample it. A complete fixed-menu meal starts at $55. For the less adventurous, there is a set menu of delicious sashimi for $42 to $56 a person. The restaurant, which attracts business people at lunch and elegantly clad folks headed to Ginza at night, is closed on Wednesday in October. It is a short walk from the Tsukiji Station on the Hibya Line.</p>
        <p>Naturally, Tsukiji abounds in sushi shops and all have the traditional slatted doors and windows and long sushi bars, where you can watch the chefs. Sushi-ko, at 4-7-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, (81-3) 3547-0505, is a great choice. Another area favorite is Sushi Iwa, 2-15-12 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, (81-3) 3541-0655. Count on spending a minimum of $50 a person, without drinks at either place for an indescribibly fresh meal.</p>
        <p>Among young Japanese, Ristorante Hiro, 5-5-25 Minami-aoyama, Minato-ku, (81-3) 3486-5561, is a top choice for Italian food. The capellini freddi alla checca, cold pasta with fresh tomatoes, is popular. Dinner for two with drinks, $120. It's near the Omote-Sando station.</p>
        <p>For inexpensive Western-style food like burgers and sausages, try Tsubame Grill, 1-8-20 Ginza, Chuo-ku (Ginza-Ichome subway station), (81-3) 3561-3788. A dinner for two with drinks is about $55.</p>
