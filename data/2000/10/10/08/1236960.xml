        <p>ALL he wanted was a place to go for breakfast. And when Michael Fareri, this town's most visible and prolific developer, decides he wants something here, it tends to happen. Moreover, it happens on an ambitious scale.</p>
        <p>So on a recent fall evening, powerful spotlights crisscrossed the night sky to mark the opening of Mr. Fareri's latest project: Route 22, which is billed as Westchester's first ''concept restaurant.''</p>
        <p>Far beyond a modest breakfast spot, Route 22 serves three meals a day seven days a week and already offers its own merchandise. Customers can buy everything from boxer shorts to leather jackets emblazoned with the ''Route 22'' logo, a fire-engine-red road sign bearing the restaurant's name.</p>
        <p>Built on the site of an old gas station, the restaurant is designed to create instant nostalgia -- with decor from the 1930's, including three old-fashioned gasoline pumps, a Depression-era phone booth and a 1931 Model A Ford suspended from the ceiling over the shining, white-tiled ''exhibition kitchen'' -- where customers can watch their food being prepared. The burnished wood bar came from the Woolworth Building.</p>
        <p>With its mix of the past, a multimillion dollar investment and an ambitious expansion plan, the restaurant is emblematic of Armonk itself these days. The community, which is part of the town of North Castle and lies 30 miles from midtown Manhattan, has undergone a real estate explosion over the last decade. Mansions and town houses with Victorian-style fronts and other decorative nods to the past sit on what was once farmland. Much of that development has been done by Mr. Fareri himself.</p>
        <p>''I've developed between 200 and 300 houses or dwelling units in this community,'' Mr. Fareri said at the restaurant's opening. ''I did this place because Armonk didn't have a place for breakfast. I'm not a restaurateur. I'm a developer. But I felt there was a need for this in the community.''</p>
        <p>The restaurant is on Old Route 22, a road that is only six-tenths of a mile long, which runs from Route 22 South to Main Street (Route 128) and is fast becoming almost unrecognizable to longtime Armonk residents. One landmark, Schultz's Cider Mill, has been negotiating with a developer (not Mr. Fareri) who wants to build a supermarket on the land.</p>
        <p>The Whipporwill Hills housing development was built on the hills which rise behind the old farm stand. Armonk Bowl closed last year; Mr. Fareri owns the land and hopes to build his own supermarket there -- the kind with a coffee bar and gourmet take out. If that does not work out, Mr. Fareri said, he will probably build a health club.</p>
        <p>The Route 22 restaurant is on the site of the Paramount Garage, which opened in 1926 and closed about five years ago. In keeping with the theme, the front of the red brick building has a large (new) white garage door in front. A restored 1951 GMC truck, painted bright red with the Route 22 logo, is parked in front.</p>
        <p>Hanging on the walls inside the building are photographs of old Armonk, provided by the Armonk Historical Society. Old family photographs of the original garage owners are also on display.</p>
        <p>''We wanted patrons to enter this restaurant and immediately get a sense of what Armonk and the world was like in a different time,'' Mr. Fareri said, without a trace of irony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fareri worked on Route 22 with Lance Root, a restaurateur who helped develop the Hard Rock Cafe, the Harley-Davidson Cafe and the All-Star Cafe. Mr. Root, who specializes in restaurant start-ups, said the opening of Route 22 was the beginning of a new restaurant corporation. Currently, he is negotiating a second location, which Mr. Root would only say was ''within 30 miles'' of the first.</p>
        <p>''This is Westchester County's first concept restaurant,'' Mr. Root said. ''There are 'Fridays' and other chains, but this is the first that was born here in Westchester.''</p>
        <p>Route 22 already boasts a ''signature drink'' (the Route 22 martini -- a blend of vodka, Chambord and pineapple) a ''signature appetizer'' (a hot spinach dip) and, of course, ''signature dishes'' (marinated sirloin steak sandwiches and Danish baby back pork ribs). Needless to say, there is a ''signature dessert'' -- described as an updated s'more. Signature sauces and salad dressings are for sale at the restaurant's shop next to the whiskey and pub glasses with the Route 22 logo.</p>
        <p>Much of the decor was chosen by Mr. Fareri himself. He found the Model A Ford on the Internet; many of the signs came from forays to Manhattan and Vermont. He bought wood carvings in Las Vegas, and an old washing machine came from the basement of his house.</p>
        <p>''I took a lot of stuff we've collected over the years,'' Mr. Fareri said. ''I had a lot of fun with it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fareri used opening night to entertain donors to the new Maria Fareri Westchester Children's Hospital, for which ground was broken last Tuesday. Mr. Fareri serves on the board of the new hospital, which is named for his niece, who died in 1995.</p>
