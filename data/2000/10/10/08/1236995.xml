        <p>YOU can hear it in the elementary school here. ''Every Friday at noon the kids give a 'Go Dobbs' cheer,'' Jamie Block, a teacher, said. ''They try to make it loud enough to be heard at the high school a couple of blocks away.''</p>
        <p>You can feel it in the high school, and in the village. Charlene Jordan, the high school principal, said: ''There's a lot of talk about it in school. And a lot of excitement in town.''</p>
        <p>You can even count it. Mayor Brian Monahan has. ''It's brought out the biggest crowds we've seen in the village,'' he said. ''The police said there were over 1,500 at the last game.''</p>
        <p>High school football is back in Dobbs Ferry. The village has its own team again. In the 1980's, Dobbs Ferry was a high school football power. It won nine sectional titles and had a 42-game winning streak, the longest in state history and one short of the national record. Under the coaching of its athletic director, Frank (Skip) Violante, it was voted the county's team of the decade. The blue and white commanded respect.</p>
        <p>But in a school of a little more than 300 students the numbers eventually catch up. By 1992, only 21 players turned out for the team. The next year, the school merged its players with an archrival, Hastings High. Violante, now the school's dean, took his coaching skills to Somers High, where his sons were on the varsity.</p>
        <p>It was an uneasy merger. In one sense, the change was small, from the familiar blue and white to blue and gold for Dobbs-Hastings. To the village of Dobbs Ferry, however, it was dramatic. Mayor Monahan said: ''In Dobbs Ferry, they would say 'It's not our team now.' ''</p>
        <p>Now it is, and Violante is back coaching it with help from Block, the elementary school teacher who is his assistant varsity coach. It was, in fact, Block who got the ball moving, reintroducing Dobbs Ferry football with a junior varsity team last year to pave the way for this season's return to the varsity level.</p>
        <p>''In building the program up I accomplished a pretty big thing in my life,'' Block said. ''The reward is a lot of old-timers who wouldn't come out for Dobbs-Hastings at our games. There are new fans, too.</p>
        <p>''But it was a long, hard road.''</p>
        <p>It still is. Ask Coach Violante.</p>
        <p>''Essentially, we're a junior varsity playing against the other team's seniors,'' he said. ''We've got freshmen and sophomores all over the place.''</p>
        <p>Three freshmen start in the four-man defensive backfield.</p>
        <p>Of the 28 players on the varsity, only 4 are seniors and 10 are juniors. The record, after a surprising 33-to-0 opening victory over Gould Academy, was 1 and 3, with a loss to Hastings before yesterday's homecoming game.</p>
        <p>But those are not the numbers that matter. Dobbs Ferry is back, and on the way back. Besides the young varsity, there are 43 seventh and eight graders in the school system's modified program. ''Even the Pop Warner football program has picked up,'' Brock said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jordan said: ''Football is part of the fall again.''</p>
        <p>And as a welcome-back gift, Dobbs Ferry put up lights in Gould Park, the team's home field. Two weekends ago the blue and white played its first-ever home night game. The lights worked perfectly even if the young team did not play well against unbeaten Haldane.</p>
        <p>And before the game, in a renewed tradition, the Brick Oven pizza shop on Main Street was host to hundreds of teenagers.</p>
        <p>''It's good for business,'' said the owner, Frank Donato. ''On Fridays the kids all come in here, some in uniform, some cheerleaders and some just fans. All over town, too, you can see kids wearing Dobbs Ferry colors.''</p>
        <p>Donato was a member of the varsity in 1984 and '85, then missed the '86 season -- the last in the undefeated run -- with an injury. ''Football is back; it feels good,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is especially felt by Jurell Rapay, the senior captain who plays on the offensive and defensive lines. He played for Dobbs-Hastings. He played on the Dobbs Ferry junior varsity last year. He is a standout on the varsity this season. ''It is a big deal,'' he said. ''As a senior, I'm finally playing varsity for my own school.''</p>
        <p>Rapay, a 5-foot-9, 190-pounder, wants to be a writer and plans to attend college. But at that level, 190-pound linemen are considered undersized. ''I don't think I'll be continuing football,'' he said, ''but I'll never forget this for the rest of my life.''</p>
        <p>Frankie Farrington has a couple of more years to enjoy the experience. The 5-foot-7, 140-pound halfback, is a talented, elusive runner and an improving pass catcher. He is thrilled to be wearing the blue and white. ''It's a lot better when you're by yourself as a team,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Winning the opening game also contributed to the football magic infusing the village. Rapay said, ''Nobody expected it, and that made it even better.''</p>
        <p>One might even say football has made the village better. Mayor Monahan said: ''The team has brought the community together. The games are a Saturday afternoon tradition again. Before a recent game, I ran into a villager who was looking forward to it. 'Those blue and gold uniforms never looked right,' he said.''</p>
