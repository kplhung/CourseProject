        <p>Sherman Douglas has stormed into the Nets' training camp to start his 12th professional season, trim, grinning again and knowing all the plays. From two decades ago.</p>
        <p>Just five years younger than his new head coach, Byron Scott, Douglas grew up watching Scott play with the Los Angeles Lakers. So when Scott introduced a play in practice, Sherman called him on it. ''I remember that,'' he said, causing his coach to chuckle.</p>
        <p>''Sherman is the smartest guy we have out there,'' Scott said Friday after the Nets' fourth day of training camp. ''He's a coach on the floor. He knows every situation out there and he's a born leader. He's been doing it for a long time. He recognizes things that we're running from 1980. His I.Q. is so high basketball-wise, it's unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>For the first time in three years, though, Douglas's mind and body are in sync. He has recovered from ankle surgery last January that caused him to miss the last 56 games of the season, and he came to camp having lost weight and in top condition.</p>
        <p>Because of Douglas's impressive early play and the Nets' injuries, the team's backcourt picture now has a fuzzy but intriguing tint to it.</p>
        <p>Scott is analyzing daily how best to make chemistry of his combinations. The backup shooting guard, Lucious Harris, underwent hernia surgery Friday and will not be back for at least six weeks, while the backup point guard, Eliot Perry, sat on the sidelines last week with a strained hip flexor. He did, however, return to practice yesterday.</p>
        <p>Point guard Stephon Marbury, who appears in Nets promotions as a Roman soldier leading his troops, has already played shooting guard sometimes in practice. Marbury compared Scott's early tinkering to Joe Torre switching the Yankees' lineup in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''Hey, whatever it takes to win,'' Marbury said. ''With Lucious going down, we need some help there.</p>
        <p>''All of this,'' he added, ''is going to be very, very interesting.''</p>
        <p>Scott said that he could pair Marbury and Sherman, who also plays point guard.</p>
        <p>''There will be instances where we have injuries and Sherman gives you another guy who can handle the ball,'' Scott said. ''Then you put your best player at the two spot, where he's catching a lot of things with his dribble,'' Scott said, referring to Marbury.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Kendall Gill, still bothered by bursitis in his right elbow, has already moved from small forward, his position the last few years, to shooting guard, even though his outside shooting was inconsistent last year. The veteran forward Johnny Newman has also played shooting guard in camp. In yesterday's morning practice, Newman, 36, sat on the sideline when his back tightened up.</p>
        <p>To fill Harris's slot, the Nets acquired Kevin Ollie, a backup point guard with the Philadelphia 76ers last year. And the free agent point guard Adrian Autry is also in camp.</p>
        <p>With the logjam at point guard, there could be a trade, though Scott said yesterday he could carry three point guards on the roster and that Ollie could also play the off guard.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's going to be enough minutes for two backup point guards,'' Douglas said. ''Nobody can have two backup point guards, because you lose chemistry.''</p>
        <p>''I'm going to force my way back as soon as possible,'' said a determined Perry, who averaged 5.3 points in 13.4 minutes last season, on Friday, before returning.</p>
        <p>Douglas played in just 20 games last season in his second tour with the Nets. He had missed his last two training camps because of injuries, in 1998 with the Los Angeles Clippers and then last season with the Nets.</p>
        <p>Sherman, who will make $1 million in the final year of his contract, was determined to be ready after rehabilitating his ankle this summer.</p>
        <p>''The older you get, you really have to come into training camp in shape,'' he said. ''I thought about it, 'Is this going to be it?' I didn't want go out like that.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Nets waived PETER CORNELL, a forward/center free agent last night in their first roster move.</p>
