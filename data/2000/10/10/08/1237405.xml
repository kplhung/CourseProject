        <p>DURR-Ernestine. The people of Saint Peter's Church a congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, gives thanks to God for the life and witness of Ernestine Durr, who died on August 24, 2000. An active member and generous supporter of Saint Peter's Church for most of her life, Ernestine served as a member of the Parish Council of Saint Peter's and was particularly strong in her support and encouragement of the Jazz Ministry, which has earned Saint Peter's its designation as ''The Jazz Church''. Beloved benefactor of the Choir School of Saint Thomas Church, much loved by her friends in the Choir School and at Saint Peter's, she lived her life ''clothed with compassion'', and as a valiant and faithful servant of the Lord. A memorial Mass of the Resurrection will be celebrated at 11:00 Saturday morning, October 14th at Saint Peter's Church, 619 Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. A reception in the Living Room will immediately follow the Mass.</p>
