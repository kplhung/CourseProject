        <p>I was parking my white rental car near the top of a high-end residential canyon in Los Angeles where I was staying last month with a friend. Opening the door, I left a tiny white dot on a neighbor's black Porsche. The next day, to my dismay, the same thing happened again, so there were two tiny white dots on the Porsche. I tried unsuccessfully to rub them off with my thumb. All week long, as I got in and out of my car, those two little white dots haunted me like a pair of eyes in the dark.</p>
        <p>I wondered how much it would cost to replace the door. I told myself I'd leave a note on the windshield. Instead, I left for New York and forgot about it.</p>

        <p>I was parking my white rental car near the top of a high-end residential canyon in Los Angeles where I was staying last month with a friend. Opening the door, I left a tiny white dot on a neighbor's black Porsche. The next day, to my dismay, the same thing happened again, so there were two tiny white dots on the Porsche. I tried unsuccessfully to rub them off with my thumb. All week long, as I got in and out of my car, those two little white dots haunted me like a pair of eyes in the dark.</p>
        <p>I wondered how much it would cost to replace the door. I told myself I'd leave a note on the windshield. Instead, I left for New York and forgot about it.</p>
        <p>But then Rosh Hashana, a time to take stock of sins, rolled in. A week later, by Yom Kippur, which begins tonight, one is supposed to have made amends.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, it's hard to know what's considered bad these days, and especially in New York. In a tiny place of big egos, how can you not leave a few dots and dents here and there? It often seems that sin exists on a sliding scale, and certain indiscretions are acceptable for survival: reading the obituaries for rent-stabilized apartments, for instance, or lying about being sick to get out of outer-borough family obligations.</p>
        <p>The question is, Where to draw the line? At not telling someone you're in his assigned seat at an oversubscribed fashion show? At befriending Monica Lewinsky because you want her at your book party? Is it O.K. to rationalize feeling gleeful when fancy dot-coms fail, saying they have no reason to exist beyond the narcissism of well-connected would-be entrepreneurs? Is it ever acceptable not to bring a present to a birthday party? What if there are 300 other  guests, it's at the trendy new Hudson hotel, and it's sponsored by Absolut?</p>
        <p>''Let us ask ourselves hard questions,'' a Rosh Hashana prayer urges. Here's one: Do gossip columns exist to enforce community standards, as sociologists maintain? (Try to be on time for court appearances, Puffy, and lose the shades, please.) Gossip, lust, pride and envy are sins, according to any religion. But without these, the elites of the media, culture and finance would flounder. Without vanity, fashion  would fall, taking with it Donna Karan's Eastern spirituality and Imitation of Christ, a new clothing line.</p>
        <p>One way to make amends is to give to charity. But are New Yorkers expected to tithe like the rest of the country, when we have to pay so much for rent, parking, decent TV reception and Gucci? Do we really have to worry about giving to charity at all, when there are so many superrich people around? Is buying a $1,000 ticket to a benefit, networking with Martha Stewart over cocktails and then getting your picture in the social columns charity -- or vanity?</p>
        <p>Over the course of last week, when I thought about all the ways I've screwed up, I also fixated on those two white dots. Even when my friend in Los Angeles said that that Porsche belonged to a lazy rich kid who could get the dots buffed off at a car wash, I did not rest.</p>
        <p>So I called Judith HaLevy, of the Malibu Jewish Center, a plugged-in rabbi I know. She told me that according to the unstated rules of Los Angeles car culture, I did not do anything wrong. But she also said that the High Holy Days are a good time to get back into alignment. Even if respect for beautiful things is as old as the Old Testament, for instance, do we need to be attached to so many beautiful things? And even if people in fashion and journalism have to be judgmental, should we be judging one another quite so fiercely? Rabbi HaLevy said that little indiscretions do matter, but what really matters is that we try to be better to our own families. Finally, she told me that even if the apologies we offer aren't perfect, trying counts for a lot.</p>
        <p>''When you connect all the little white dots,'' she said, ''they really do add up.''</p>
        <p>As a result of all this churning, I've decided to commit to charity the $1,000 it did not cost me to replace a Porsche door. I just have to figure out which worthy cause has the best benefit party.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I'm trying to get in a few more apologies before sundown.</p>
