        <p>ON July 1, Patricia Lucan took office as president of the 1,650-member New Haven Federation of Teachers. Ms. Lucan, a 53-year-old native of New Haven who now lives in Hamden, began teaching in 1969 and (with nine years off to raise her own children) has spent her entire career as a language teacher in New Haven public schools, at Lee High School and at Sheridan Academy middle school.</p>

        <p>ON July 1, Patricia Lucan took office as president of the 1,650-member New Haven Federation of Teachers. Ms. Lucan, a 53-year-old native of New Haven who now lives in Hamden, began teaching in 1969 and (with nine years off to raise her own children) has spent her entire career as a language teacher in New Haven public schools, at Lee High School and at Sheridan Academy middle school.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lucan has a master's degree and a sixth-year administrative degree from Southern Connecticut State University.</p>
        <p>At a welcome-back event for teachers in August sponsored by the New Haven superintendent, Reginald Mayo, Ms. Lucan was outspoken in demanding more respect for teachers, but also in admonishing them not to ''whine and moan.'' She called for reinstatement of family health benefits for new teachers, urged administrators, including herself, to get back into the classroom, and promoted better school nutrition.</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview conducted last month in Ms. Lucan's union office. She is a small woman, her dark hair pulled back in a no-nonsense style, who tended to whip her glasses on and off as she spoke -- a habit that resulted in flying spectacles, she said, on many occasions in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Q. In your welcome-back address, you seemed intent on giving teachers and administrators notice that you're in charge of the union now. What kind of relationship would you like to have with Superintendent Mayo and the Board of Education?</p>
        <p>A. One of mutual respect, and that means what those words say. I respect the position they are in. It's a difficult task to run any kind of a system, but I think people on top lose touch with what's going on at the ground level. What would be wrong with one day a week helping out in the classroom?</p>
        <p>Q. Do you have a proposal for administrators working in the classroom?</p>
        <p>A. I don't have a specific plan, but since we have 10 schools that did poorly on a state survey, those schools could really benefit by lowering class size with more teachers in the classroom. It would help with the teacher-shortage problem. But I'm not going to do it alone, and I doubt that any administrators agree with me. I hope something will come from my talking about it. It's like a wake-up call. I didn't say anything original but I said it publicly as a union president.</p>
        <p>Q. In what ways do you think administrators don't respect teachers?</p>
        <p>A. I have never seen it be effective, whether in teaching or something else, to overpower someone, to make them feel harassed or threatened. I'm going to follow up on every complaint a teacher makes. But the teachers are not always right; that's why I told them to stop whining and moaning.</p>
        <p>Q. Education is one of the top issues in this year's presidential campaign. What is your opinion of their focus?</p>
        <p>A. Politicians talk a good game about education, but when it comes down to getting in the trenches and getting kids to learn, it's not the top-funded priority. I hate to say money would fix all our problems with education, but money would help.</p>
        <p>Q. What are some of the important economic issues for the union?</p>
        <p>A. Many teachers in New Haven are being bought out, going to other towns with better pay and benefits. Taxpayers don't realize we are not on a par with other professionals who have even less education. New Haven is going to have to offer more money.</p>
        <p>We have to lower the steps in the contract it takes to get to maximum and give more of an increase each year. And 35 years is too long to be in any job before retiring with full benefits, especially one as stressful as teaching.</p>
        <p>Police and firefighters can retire with full benefits after 25 years, and teaching is at least as stressful as that. Now teachers who retire after 25 years get only a quarter of the average of their three highest-paid years. That's a quarter of $69,262. We have to get it down to 30 years, but that means changing a state regulation.</p>
        <p>Q. How can you change the state regulation regarding retirement benefits?</p>
        <p>A. We need to be very political. We need to lobby. We need to be part of a labor movement. We have to be more vocal about what we want and don't want.</p>
        <p>Q. You've taken a high-profile position on school nutrition. Why do you think that's so important?</p>
        <p>A. We worry about how our cars run, what kind of fuel we put in them, but what about our children? We could educate families on how to feed their kids better, but when they are at school we can do a better job ourselves. People say the kids won't eat healthier food -- let them go hungry until they do. There are foods that could be cut down in fat. We have kids who are grossly overweight, we have childhood diabetes, we have asthma.</p>
        <p>We are setting ourselves up for long-term health problems. We teach them science, we teach them health, but then we don't practice it. It's hypocrisy. Kids who qualify for the reduced price lunch program then spend two or three or four dollars a day on junk. Then they get hyperactive and there are discipline problems and the blame falls on the teachers.</p>
        <p>As president of the union, I don't want to see that. We privatized the food service a few years ago. I have no problem with that, but if you don't introduce junk to make money then the children won't buy junk.</p>
        <p>Q. You organized to get more nutritious food at Sheridan. How did you do it?</p>
        <p>A. We got the school nurses and some pediatricians involved. I bought one of every kind of junk food available at the school and put it all in a big box, and the school nurse took it to her supervisor, who's a physician. That made quite an impression.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later the food service company sent a letter home saying the food would be more nutritious at Sheridan. If they can do it at Sheridan, why not at all the schools? I'll keep saying it at board meetings: remember nutrition.</p>
        <p>Q. You have been very critical of the current union contract that excludes family health coverage for new teachers until they get tenure after four years. What can you do about it?</p>
        <p>A. I think it's insulting that that would have been offered as a bargaining chip. It's like saying new teachers are not worth keeping in the system. This city is self-insured. I'd bet it would cost about $350,000 to give new teachers family health benefits. The mayor could do it. But he wants us to give something back, and I'm not giving anything back unless my executive board tells me to.</p>
        <p>We already gave back a lot in the last contract, which included a wage freeze. The new contract created more steps to reach the maximum. It kept starting pay the same for four years. I was not involved in the negotiation and I'm not going to second-guess those who were. I just want to say not enough money was provided for an equitable contract.</p>
