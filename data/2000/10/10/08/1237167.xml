        <p>Re ''Working for Women's Sexual Rights'' (news article, Oct. 2): Women's human rights violations are not news to the world, but not enough has been done to improve the actual condition of women.</p>
        <p>There are still societies in which women are murdered for not bringing enough dowry, or treated cruelly for not giving birth to a male child. Some are stoned to death for getting an abortion, losing their virginity before marriage or even for marrying a person out of their religion; others are smuggled across borders like commodities for prostitution.</p>
        <p>In our own country, some radical forces are trying hard to deprive women of their basic human right to have an abortion.</p>
        <p>Improving this situation is going to take lot more effort on the part of progressive men and women everywhere, not just words of recognition from the United Nations.</p>
