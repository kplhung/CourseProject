        <p>Political oddsmakers rate Charles S. Robb of Virginia the most vulnerable Democratic senator this year. In a state that Republicans have come to dominate, he is the last Democrat holding statewide office and he barely hung onto his seat when he ran for re-election six years ago.</p>
        <p>Since then he has struggled to improve his standing with voters. But poll after poll has shown him lagging 10 points or so behind his popular Republican challenger, former Governor George Allen.</p>
        <p>Until recently.</p>
        <p>Now it appears Mr. Robb may be closing the gap. A poll published last week by The Richmond Times-Dispatch showed him trailing Mr. Allen by only three points, with about 10 percent of the electorate still undecided.</p>
        <p>But if that poll offered some good news for Mr. Robb, it also seemed to  offer some not-so-good news.</p>
        <p>Historically, women have given Mr. Robb, a political moderate, his winning edge in elections. But the new poll has Mr. Allen, a conservative, almost matching him vote for vote with women. What is more, in a possible hint of lurking trouble for Mr. Robb, two of every three undecided voters are women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robb has been trying to attract the fence-sitters, pointing out that he favors -- but Mr. Allen opposes -- abortion rights and stronger gun control laws, hot-button issues with many women. He also held a rally in northern Virginia with five Democratic women who are colleagues in the Senate, among them Barbara Boxer of California.</p>
        <p>''Chuck always gives us heart failure in these elections,'' she told the crowd.</p>
