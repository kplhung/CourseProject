        <p>For Mark Hampton, it was a pair of shutters he painted as a boy. For Mario Buatta, it was the experience of buying an 18th-century lap desk. What triggered Russell Bush's aesthetic epiphany was a magazine article extolling the town and country houses of the English photographer and dandy Cecil Beaton.</p>
        <p>Beaton's neo-Edwardian hoopla made an instant impression. ''I want to live just like this when I grow up,'' the schoolboy told his mother, brandishing a copy of House &amp; Garden circa 1965. Today, after a brief detour working as a lingerie designer and a museum stylist, Bush not only sleeps in the steel-frame bed from Beaton's London pad, which he acquired from a friend, but he is a budding tastemaker to boot. And he may just be on his way to being Kutztown, Pa.'s most celebrated graduate since Keith Haring.</p>

        <p>For Mark Hampton, it was a pair of shutters he painted as a boy. For Mario Buatta, it was the experience of buying an 18th-century lap desk. What triggered Russell Bush's aesthetic epiphany was a magazine article extolling the town and country houses of the English photographer and dandy Cecil Beaton.</p>
        <p>Beaton's neo-Edwardian hoopla made an instant impression. ''I want to live just like this when I grow up,'' the schoolboy told his mother, brandishing a copy of House &amp; Garden circa 1965. Today, after a brief detour working as a lingerie designer and a museum stylist, Bush not only sleeps in the steel-frame bed from Beaton's London pad, which he acquired from a friend, but he is a budding tastemaker to boot. And he may just be on his way to being Kutztown, Pa.'s most celebrated graduate since Keith Haring.</p>
        <p>''He is an artist of spaces,'' says Shamina Talyarkhan, the owner of a hand-beaded-embroidery company that supplies couture fashion houses. Talyarkhan handed Bush the keys to her awkwardly proportioned modern penthouse on the Upper East Side and came home to a shimmering, stone-colored space dotted with handmade silver tables and Jaipur miniatures. ''The reasons I adore him are simple,'' she adds. ''First, he has exquisite taste. Second, he has a sense of style, personal and professional, that surely comes from the time he worked at the Costume Institute under Diana Vreeland. Third, he's a genius.''</p>
        <p>Bush, 47, grins at the praise. ''I'm a camouflage decorator,'' he says, modestly allowing that he has a passion for transforming the disreputable into the deluxe. ''Not everybody wants to blow out the walls and start over from scratch,'' he adds, plainly puzzled by the notion of bulldozer decorating. ''There's nothing wrong with working with what's already there and making it better.''</p>
        <p>A postmodern staircase in garish orange pearwood and brass? Bush gave it a Zen makeover using ebony stain and a dose of bronze finishing, until it looked like something Marlene Dietrich might have descended in ''Shanghai Express.'' A bedroom swathed in sweet-tempered, tea-green silk in the same Upper East Side apartment now has unexpected backbone: black Chinese tables and an unconventional headboard composed of towering 19th-century panels of French black and gold lacquer.</p>
        <p>In his own apartment -- a bijou one-bedroom whose tidy exoticism is one part Goncourt brothers to two parts ''Arabian Nights'' -- stacks of books are stored behind ceiling-high folding screens upholstered in Mughal woodblock-print cotton. And the gossamer silk bedroom curtains are edged in lowly black rickrack trim that, in Bush's hands, becomes suddenly chic. Even more startling is the fact that he made them himself.</p>
        <p>The apartment is a three-dimensional album of influences, its two small rooms filled with objects imbued with personal meaning. ''I like to surround myself with things that remind me of people I've known or admired,'' Bush says. Which accounts for such evocative ephemera as an envelope decorated by the ''Madeline'' illustrator, Ludwig Bemelmans, and addressed to the decorator Elsie de Wolfe; a pair of polychrome Russian side chairs that belonged to the great, eccentric Parisian designer Madeleine Castaing; and a small portrait of Stephen Tennant, a British socialite whose heavy makeup and passion for sailors and seashells made him an icon of alternative chic in the 1920's. A 19th-century French shawl conceals an old Singer sewing-machine base found in a shop in Pennsylvania. Though nothing special, it serves its purpose as a table. More than a practical solution, it is a subtle emblem of why Bush's clients feel they can trust him to stick to their budgets, even if they've been burned by other decorators in the past.</p>
        <p>''We've heard about designer scams a lot lately, but he's not going to embroil you in multimillion-dollar pieces of furniture -- unless that's what you want,'' says Claudia Cohen, the entertainment reporter for ''Live With Regis,'' who has been a Bush client for more than a decade. (He's working on her house in the Hamptons, and recently completed a screening room in her Manhattan apartment.) ''He's scrupulously honest, and a gentleman, too -- kind and gracious and honorable.'' And he has his priorities straight, Cohen adds. ''He'll show you a world-class, museum-quality antique for the living room, and in the same meeting, flip through the Pottery Barn catalog and find the perfect table for your guest room.''</p>
        <p>''I come from simple stock,'' Bush says by way of explanation. ''My mama did not wear couture.'' But what his mother lacked in high fashion, she made up for in valuable life lessons. ''She taught me to see,'' Bush says, whether it was vegetables at the produce stand or old furniture at a local antique show. ''She taught me to pick out things that had the nicest shape, that were painted with the best symmetry. If I can tell a bad painting from a good painting, it's because of my mother.''</p>
        <p>A 10-year stint under the wing of the society architect Peter Marino didn't hurt, either. ''Peter is obsessed with quality,'' says Bush, who went solo three years ago, after working on projects for the arts patron Anne Bass and the fashion designer Valentino. ''And so am I.''</p>
        <p>His quest for the best doesn't mean riding roughshod over a client's desires. One woman told him, ''I know you don't think I have good taste, but this is what I like,'' apologizing for her insistence on a teeth-aching color scheme of peach and green. Bush wasn't disappointed; he was thrilled. ''My job is not to impose my taste,'' he says. ''My job is to take peach and green and make it beautiful.''</p>
        <p>The American-born Victoria Lady de Rothschild, whose country house in England Bush helped to decorate, says, ''We work well as a team.'' The pair's common heroines are Diana Vreeland and Pauline de Rothschild, and it's Bush's mind as well as his talent that keeps her enthralled. ''When we met, there was this instant rapport, we were kindred spirits,'' Lady de Rothschild adds. ''He knows the history of everything: period furniture, fashion, people. So when we're together, we go off on these long conversations.''</p>
        <p>To Bush, a room should reflect its occupant. ''Everybody's trying so hard to be stylish, everybody's too overly design conscious,'' he says, recalling the cognoscenti's disappointment when Jacqueline Onassis's legendarily luxurious apartment turned out to be merely pretty in photographs published after her death. ''People said it was so ugly, so dull, but I thought it was perfect. It was the backdrop to a fascinating woman. Rooms shouldn't compete with the people who live in them.'' And, he adds, eyes widening in astonishment, ''since when has 'pretty' been a dirty word?''</p>
        <p>His look? He doesn't have a label for what he does, and doesn't want one, though one observer called it tradition-with-a-twist. Bush isn't so sure, but he accepts the description -- for now. ''I'm still formulating what I'm doing, where I'm going,'' he says. ''I'm always learning. I never want to lose that.''</p>
