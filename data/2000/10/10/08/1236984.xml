        <p>Claire Fagin letter on Wendy Lesser's October 1 article proposes different dream cast for TV's Law and Order (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Wendy Lesser's article ''It May Be Timely, but It's Way Past Its Prime'' [Oct. 1], on our mutual addiction, ''Law and Order,'' evoked a slightly different dream cast than mine. My team would be Michael Moriarty, Richard Brooks, Chris Noth and Jerry Orbach. There is no comparison between Sam Waterston and his assistant district attorneys, and Michael Moriarty and Richard Brooks. Mr. Moriarty brought intelligence, compassion and integrity to the role without the pomposity and self-righteousness that is either Mr. Waterston's interpretation or the way the writing for him has changed the role. And Richard Brooks was superb and creative. The show was clearer and grittier early on, but fortunately the reruns, even twice seen, are terrific.</p>
