        <p>A Bay Area World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics would be a tame preliminary to a turf battle between the owners of the two teams. That battle may never develop, but it simmers close to the surface.</p>
        <p>The object of the potential scrap: San Jose. The Giants have it; the Athletics want it.</p>
        <p>''Obviously there has been a three-decade debate on the relationship of the Giants and the A's in the Bay Area, and baseball frankly has attempted to solve it in many different ways over the years,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said. ''It's something I'm monitoring extremely closely and I continue to talk to both clubs.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' wildly successful new home, Pacific Bell Park, has only exacerbated the tension between the teams, making the team 12 miles away on the other side of the water feel even more like the Bay Area's stepchild.</p>
        <p>The Oakland owners, Stephen Schott and Ken Hofmann, are said by some people in baseball to want either to move the team to San Jose or neighboring Santa Clara, or, perhaps preferably, receive permission to sell to someone who would move the team to San Jose or Santa Clara.</p>
        <p>Calls to the owners seeking clarification of their position were not returned; Jim Young, a club spokesman, said the owners ''don't make themselves available to the press.''</p>
        <p>Michael Crowley, the club president, said he wasn't sure ''what the owners have done at this point.''</p>
        <p>But he added, ''There's no question that the economic engine of the Bay Area, if not the world, is the Silicon Valley.''</p>
        <p>Peter Magowan, the Giants' managing partner, left no doubt about his position. San Jose and Santa Clara are in Santa Clara County, he noted and explained that Santa Clara County is an integral part of the established Giants territory.</p>
        <p>''When Schott and Hofmann bought the A's franchise, they knew what territorial rights the A's had and what territorial rights the Giants had,'' Magowan said. ''Santa Clara County is in the Giants' territorial rights so they can't really go there if we object. If they want to violate our territory, there will be a battle.''</p>
        <p>The Major League Constitution delineates each team's operating territory. In the case of other two-team areas -- New York, Chicago and Los Angeles/Anaheim -- the territories listed for each team are the same, with the provision that they ''shall be shared'' with the other team.</p>
        <p>However, the same formula does not apply with the Giants and the Athletics. The Athletics have Alameda and Contra Costa counties, both on their side of the bay. The Giants have San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey and Marin, a string of counties that occupy the coast line north and south of San Francisco. ''We have been assured by Bud Selig that he will be supportive of every franchise's territorial rights,'' Magowan said.</p>
        <p>Any change in the existing understanding would require a three-quarters vote among the 30 major league clubs.</p>
        <p>''If the Athletics want to go right across the street from Yankee Stadium, they could do it if they could persuade three-quarters of the clubs to go along with that,'' Magowan said. ''But I think all the clubs know if they vote to violate this guy's territorial rights, then the precedent has been set for the violation of their territorial rights so I don't expect that to be a very successful initiative.''</p>
        <p>The Athletics' owners bought the team five years ago and tried to sell it last year, but the league owners tabled the proposed $122 million deal, effectively killing the sale. The general feeling among the owners of other teams was that the prospective purchasing group did not have pockets deep enough to operate the team and would most likely be looking to sell it themselves in a few years.</p>
        <p>Schott and Hofmann have not attempted to sell the team since, but they have been reported to have spoken with officials and others in the potentially lucrative San Jose/Santa Clara area. In fact, one official said Selig told club officials to cease and desist after newspaper articles began appearing about their talks.</p>
        <p>Santa Clara County, 40 miles south of San Francisco, is in the heart of Silicon Valley, where a team would most likely prosper far more than some existing teams.</p>
        <p>''This is a privately built ballpark,'' Magowan said of the Giants' pride and joy. ''We paid for this ourselves. The people who helped build this are our fans and the heart of our fan base is in San Mateo County and Santa Clara County, so all of the people who bought charter seats and bought sponsorships and bought suites, their loyalty to the Giants would be adrift if there were a competing stadium in San Jose.''</p>
        <p>Just last week city officials in Oakland came up with a site for a new ballpark in their town that they speculate could be as beneficial financially to the Athletics as Pacific Bell Park is to the Giants. But given the experience across the bay, the team's owners would certainly be expected to finance a significant portion of the construction, and they have shown no inclination to take that economic step.</p>
        <p>The Giants drew 3,315,330 fans this season, the Athletics 1,728,888.</p>
        <p>''From the team's perspective, what's happening with our attendance right now is certainly a concern,'' Crowley said. ''We've said from the start we're going to make an attempt to make it work in Oakland.''</p>
        <p>How long will they make the attempt? ''That remains to be seen,'' the executive said.</p>
        <p>While the Athletics struggle, the Giants have increased their revenue to about $145 million from $68 million last year. They will show a profit of about $7 million. They made their $20 million mortgage payment for this year in one line item on the business ledger: Last season they sold $3 million in stadium sponsorships, this year $23 million.</p>
        <p>While Giants officials express confidence that baseball will maintain the status quo in the Bay Area, they will exhale only when Selig issues a final decision on the matter. He is not expected to do that for some time.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Bud Selig wants to do anything that would help a relocated franchise be successful if their success comes at the expense of making an already successful franchise into a nonsuccessful one,'' Magowan said. ''That's what he has to really think about.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying San Jose isn't a lot better market than Oakland. I know it is. Anybody would know it is. It's a bigger market. It's faster growing. There's more money down there. There's more corporate support down there. Nobody argues with that. The question is would it hurt the Giants. The answer to that is yes, it would. The conclusion is, therefore, I think, by Bud Selig, it should not be done.''</p>
        <p>Asked what the Athletics thought the commissioner's position should be, Crowley said: ''I think Bud has to act in what he feels is the best interests of baseball. That's his charter.''</p>
        <p>Apathy in Montreal</p>
        <p>The franchise most urgently in need of relocation is the Montreal Expos. With an attendance of 926,263, they were the only team that didn't attract one million fans. People in Montreal once cared about the team, but at this point if the Expos left, would anyone miss them?</p>
        <p>The question is if Jeffrey Loria, the managing partner, wanted to move the team to northern Virginia, could he do it? Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' owner, has said he will do whatever was necessary to block a team from moving into the Washington-northern Virginia area, but that area is not part of the Orioles' territory.</p>
        <p>Their territory is listed as the city of Baltimore and five counties in Maryland, nothing outside the state.</p>
        <p>Going Against the Norm</p>
        <p>One of the major pieces of statistical evidence presented by the Blue Ribbon Panel on Baseball Economics in dealing with payroll disparity was that from 1995 through 1999, no team with a payroll in the third and fourth quartiles won a playoff game.</p>
        <p>Oakland has ruined that perfect record, winning two games of their playoff series against the Yankees. However, the Athletics' victories have been the only ones registered by a team in payroll quartiles III and IV. They have also lost two games to the Yankees , and the Chicago White Sox lost all three of their games with Seattle. Four of the playoff teams are in the first quartile and two are in the second.</p>
        <p>So Much for Milestones</p>
        <p>So Todd Helton did not hit .400, Darin Erstad did not break the record for hits in a season, Jose Lima did not give up the most home runs ever by a pitcher, no batter hit 60 home runs for the first time in three years, the season went without a no-hitter for the first time since 1989 and no team changed managers during the season for the first time since 1942. Of course, a week after the season, five teams have fired their managers.</p>
        <p>And for the first time in history, no team finished with a won-lost percentage as high as .600 or as low as .400. One more victory by the Giants or another loss for Philadelphia or the Chicago Cubs would have prevented history from being made.</p>
