        <p>How to lure new audiences and hold on to the old ones? Easy. Produce popular plays and musicals with starry casts. Or at least go for the fashion of the moment: diversity, classics and contemporary works that offer easy associations, familiar comforts and multicultural assurances.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, the surest way to keep the seats empty is to put on new works by unheard-of writers with casts of unknowns.</p>
        <p>If that's the common wisdom, three uncommon professional theaters in New Jersey don't care. The artistic directors of the Forum in Metuchen, Playwrights Theater of New Jersey in Madison and the New Jersey Repertory Company in Long Branch are all producing new works, and new works only, this season. For them, the future of theater depends on the  sounds of new voices. And they know their audiences  will listen.</p>
        <p>It's not that other professional theaters are turning away from the untested. In addition to one world premiere at Luna Stage in Montclair, the American Stage in Teaneck and George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick have two on tap, one of them a musical.  And the Passage Theater in Trenton has three new works in various stages of development.</p>
        <p>It's just that the theaters highlighted here are devoting their seasons to new works exclusively.  Meanwhile, allow the Forum one lapse: a well-known  modern play by a well-known playwright, ''I'm Not Rappaport'' by Herb Gardner. Why?</p>
        <p>''Well, we've got to survive,'' said Peter J. Loewy, the theater's otherwise risk-taking producing artistic director.</p>
        <p>''And that helps support shows like 'Elephant Sighs' and 'Sons of Don Juan',''</p>
        <p>he added, mentioning two of four new plays in a season that he describes as ''quite a departure for us.''</p>
        <p>That it is, the Forum having made a bit of a name for itself in 18 years, first as a second home for unsung musicals, then as a welcoming place for plays with Jewish themes.</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Loewy is forsaking ethnic roots, not with ''Rappaport'' as a safety net and ''The Jazz Singer'' in a new adaptationn.</p>
        <p>Both the new -- and the diverse -- will be on display in ''Sons of Don Juan,'' about a Cuban night club singer -- a hair dresser by day -- in Union City, which has a large Cuban population. And ''Eddie and the Cruisers,'' Mr. Loewy's own adaptation, with Kenny Vance, of the 1980's cult movie, is trying to attract another audience, rock 'n' roll fans who don't usually go to the theater.</p>
        <p>''Elephant Sighs,'' by Ed Simpson, the Forum season opener, is ''a guy play,'' in the words of Mr. Simpson, an associate professor of theater at Indiana  University of Pennsylvania. While not intended to be a response to the films ''First Wives Club'' and ''Waiting to Exhale,'' in a way it is.</p>
        <p>''I don't really know any men like those,'' the playwright said. ''I've written about decent family men who live their lives trying to do the right thing.  They love their wives, they honor their women.''</p>
        <p>At the three-year-old New Jersey Rep, 10 of the 12 plays produced so far by the theater have been new works. ''By now, the audience has come to expect the unlikely,'' said the company's executive producer Gabor Barabas.</p>
        <p>Of this season's four, three are world premieres: ''In Search of Red River Dog,'' ''Piaf in Vienna'' and ''Immortal Interlude,'' a musical. The fourth, ''An Unhappy Woman,'' is a New Jersey first. In the theater's Monday night series, 70 new plays  have been given staged readings.</p>
        <p>Why do Dr. Barabas, the director of the pediatric neurological program at Monmouth Medical Center by day, and his wife, SuzAnne Barabas, the theater's full-time artistic director, devote themselves to new  plays?</p>
        <p>''We are acutely aware of how difficult it is for new playwrights to  get their work on,'' he said. ''They need a place to take chances, to make mistakes, to get to where their promise may be. Theater is a threatened art form. It can stagnate unless new works are done. We're not so much about producing new plays as we are about trying to keep the theater alive.''</p>
        <p>While New Jersey Rep is still experimenting with nurturing playwrights and evolving plays, the Playwrights Theater of New Jersey, now in its 16th season, has become known as the state's new play development center, with defined phases in a play's evolution: round-table readings, concert readings and, for the second season, three fully staged  productions.</p>
        <p>Its season opener and first musical, ''Dance With Me,'' is a revue that means to create a theatrical context for songs by John and Johanna Hall and Jonell Mosser, from the familiar (''Half Moon,'' a hit for Janis Joplin) to the lesser-known.</p>
        <p>''Criminal Acts,'' the season's second new work, is ''about three youths searching for morality when there's no way of making the world right for them,'' Mr. Megel said.</p>
        <p>And the final play is a project actually, since it consists of 10 short pieces by as many playwrights, under the collective title ''Free Market.'' The project is a meditation on jobs -- from a poodle trainer to a spiritual healer to the more mundane. It is to move intact to an off-off Broadway theater when the run in Madison concludes in May.</p>
        <p>''Our audiences have become loyal participants in the process of play writing,'' Mr. Megel said. ''They  want something different. They want to be in on the unknown. They look to theatergoing as an adventure.''</p>
        <p>A Really New Season</p>
