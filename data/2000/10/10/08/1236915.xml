        <p>ONE of the most surprising and rewarding exhibitions of the new season is ''Mediterranean: From Courbet to Matisse'' at the Grand Palais. Its subject is the discovery, from 1850 to 1914, of the south of France as a place that was waiting for great new art to be born.</p>
        <p>Not everyone in Paris got the point of this show ahead of time. What could it be, if not a rerun of achievements that have already been amply celebrated? Cezanne, Monet, Renoir, Bonnard, Matisse and Picasso have been in and out of major exhibitions forever, or so it seems. Official consecration was the last thing they needed.</p>
        <p>''Mediterranean: From Courbet to Matisse'' was organized by Francoise Cachin, who has overall charge of 32 French national museums and oversees to a certain extent 1,000 smaller institutions countrywide. It seemed implausible that she could plan and supervise this major exhibition down to its every last detail.</p>
        <p>But this is a show that no one else has ever attempted. Ms. Cachin had distinct advantages and has taken advantage of all of them. She was brought up in a house in Saint-Tropez called La Hune, which was bought by her grandfather, the painter Paul Signac, in 1897. During the critical moment of the Fauve movement, La Hune was central to the development of a new kind of French painting.</p>
        <p>This show is not, however, a family memoir. Ms. Cachin is steeped in every aspect of her subject and has also mastered the literature of the area. Her 122-page introduction to the catalog starts at the moment when almost the whole of the Mediterranean coast of France was avoided by the cultivated traveler. She writes, for instance, that in 1675 Madame de Sevigne said that anyone who had ever taken a deep breath in the air of Marseille would know that there was something disreputable about the city.</p>
        <p>By 1861, that tide had turned. When she was convalescing near Toulon, George Sand wrote: ''I never dreamed that our poor France had anything so beautiful to show. People are always going abroad in search of something better. But maybe the best of all -- better even than the Bosphorus -- is what we have here.''</p>
        <p>SOMEONE who agreed with her, though on different grounds, was Gustave Courbet. His was a time when the sea was regarded in general as ugly, boring and potentially dangerous; fishermen liked to live in the back of their houses to avoid looking at it. It was Courbet who painted the little picture that greets the visitor at the start of the show, where it hangs on a very large wall, all by itself.</p>
        <p>The painting, ''The Edge of the Sea at Palavas,'' bears out what was said long ago by the French critic Remy de Gourmont -- that ''the most important creation of the 19th century may have been our conception of the sea.'' Painted in 1854, before the area could be reached by train from Paris, it shows a man standing on a rock at the sea's edge. With his back to us, he holds his big hat high in the air in an ecstatic salute to the ocean. Whereas others had found the sheer immensity of the sea unnerving, Courbet reacted to it, as he said himself, in the way a man reacts to his beloved.</p>
        <p>If other artists did not rival Courbet's panache, they nonetheless had daring, determination and tenacity. By 1864, Cezanne was working at L'Estaque, near Marseille, to which he remained faithful until 1886, when he was driven out by new buildings that ruined the view. Cezanne's three paintings of L'Estaque give the present show its point of departure. It could even be said of his ''Rocks at L'Estaque'' of 1882 that it can be read almost as a self-portrait, so intense was his stubborn determination to get on the mat with his intractable subject.</p>
        <p>In this context it should be said that although Renoir was not one to let the struggle show, his one contribution to the present exhibition is also a painting of rocks at L'Estaque dated 1882. By his own account, Renoir met Cezanne there that year, and they worked together. Undeniably, Renoir did put into the painting a muscle that did not come to him every day.</p>
        <p>As with all exhibitions, the curator's problem is not to get good paintings but to get the best paintings, and to explain them, both in the artists' own words and in an intelligent and informed commentary. The works in ''Courbet to Matisse'' are about as good as they can be, all the way to the final room. There are Bonnards that remind us that in 1946 he said he would like to introduce himself to the young painters of 2000 with his paintings fresh and intact, as if he ''had arrived on butterflies' wings.''</p>
        <p>Matisse imparts his final word with two of the 20th century's finest paintings -- the ''Door-Window,'' made in the autumn of 1914, and the ''Interior With Violin,'' of 1917-18. Anyone who does not regard it as a privilege to see these in the same room in the middle of Paris is a functional illiterate where painting is concerned.</p>
        <p>The same courtesy is extended to everyone from the original South of France group. But where this show differs from others on the subject is that it introduces a large group of international sympathizers, many of whom are rarely or never discussed in this context. There are, for instance, a Norwegian (Edvard Munch), a Czech (Frantisek Kupka), two Spaniards (Joaquin Sorolla and Santiago Rusinol), a Swiss (Felix Vallotton), a Dane (J. F. Willumsen) and a Catalan (Joaquim Mir).</p>
        <p>None of these is either a passenger or a courtesy case. Every one of them has an unfamiliar take on the subject. The same is true of Ernest Meissonier, a favorite of the Paris Salon in the second half of the 19th century, who brings an unexpectedly light and delicate hand to a scene of horseback riding in Antibes in 1868.</p>
        <p>And although Munch did not usually walk on the sunny side of the street, he, too, brought an unspoiled enthusiasm to an early view (1891) of the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. That famous parade ground had at the time no paved roads, no automobiles and almost no public. But Munch made much with little.</p>
        <p>Much else could be spelled out. Monet was no one's idea of a social or an environmental critic, but in his ''Villas in Bordighera'' of 1884 he made a subtle and maybe unconscious comment on social change -- the arrival, in other words, of villas that stood high above the simple two-story houses of an earlier day. Many a charming town came to be destroyed in this way.</p>
        <p>Among first-time visitors, none was more enthusiastic than Vincent van Gogh, who arrived in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, between Sete and Martigues, in the spring of 1888. ''At last I am in the Midi!'' he wrote to his brother, Theo. And later: ''The Mediterranean has a color like a  mackerel -- always changing, that is to say. You never know whether it's green or violet. One's never quite sure that it's blue.''</p>
        <p>This was an archetypal first response to a major adventure that is wonderfully recorded in page after page of the catalog, and on wall after wall in the Grand Palais.</p>
