        <p>Followers of the Falun Gong sect  mounted their largest, most coordinated protests in a year on China's National Day, showing that their numbers may have been thinned by the government's year-and-a-half crackdown on the group but that their spirit has not been broken.</p>
        <p>Despite efforts by the police to screen people traveling by train and bus toward the capital, hundreds of Falun Gong faithful made it onto the square crowded with tens of thousands of people out for the holiday. The scattered protests were brief, ending in arrest, but their frequency forced police to close part of the square for at least half an hour.</p>
