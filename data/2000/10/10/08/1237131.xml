        <p>Is life in the city getting better?</p>
        <p>For half the New Yorkers who responded to a City Council poll, the answer was a resounding ''not really.''</p>
        <p>But the results of the poll, which were released Wednesday, were not all gloomy. Eighty-three percent of the 2,100 respondents to the random telephone survey rated the city as a good or excellent place for economic opportunity. Sixty-eight percent gave the same positive rating to the city as a place to live.</p>
        <p>The survey, sponsored by the City Council and conducted in August by researchers at the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, was the first of what the Council expects to be an annual poll of public opinion about the performance of city government. The survey had a 3 percent margin of error.</p>
        <p>(Despite the fact that those polled were kept on the phone for almost half an hour, 80 percent of the people called agreed to participate.)</p>
        <p>Respondents cited education, crime and housing as issues that should be the top priorities of city government. Issues like police misconduct, taxes and the environment, which often make their way into headlines and mayoral politics, were low on the list of concerns.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most surprising were findings on more narrowly drawn questions about life in the city and the quality of government services. Respondents clearly indicated that they worried about the cost of housing, with 31 percent saying they were paying more than they could afford, and 45 percent saying they had seriously considered leaving the city because housing costs were so high.</p>
        <p>Among the most bothersome problems cited were an unexpectedly long list of seemingly minor complaints: broken pay phones, overflowing public trash containers, suspicious tap water, dim street lights, waiting on hold for a 911 operator, littered sidewalks, the lack of public toilets, and taxicabs that ignore waiting passengers.</p>
        <p>The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said of these findings: ''New York is a first-rate city with a booming economy. We should expect that our trash baskets don't overflow and that our pay phones shouldn't all be broken.''</p>
        <p>Public libraries and parks were the services that got the highest marks.</p>
        <p>When those polled were asked how they felt about the people running city government, 46 percent said they had ''some confidence.'' Another 27 percent said they had either ''very little confidence'' or ''no confidence at all.''</p>
