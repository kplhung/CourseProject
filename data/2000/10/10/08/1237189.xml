        <p>As Election Day draws near, it is time to remember that this country has had a lot of presidential losers. In fact, Rutgers University has an exhibit about them, ''The Dust Bin of History: Presidential Losers, 1796-1996.''</p>
        <p>The list is complete -- from John Adams, who lost to George Washington, through Bob Dole, who lost to Bill Clinton -- represented in buttons, paintings, photographs, pamphlets, cartoons, posters and attack ads of the day. The 1872 loser, Horace Greeley, is pictured in a cartoon in the clutches of the tobacco lobby. The 1856 loser, John Fremont, is shown in the clutches of the suffragettes. New Jersey itself has had its share of losers: General George McClellan, an 1864 presidential candidate, and Theodore Frelinghuysen, an 1856 vice presidential candidate.</p>

        <p>Wendell Willkie, a well-known loser, made the interesting observation in 1940 on a button about his opponent, F.D.R.: ''No man is good three times.'' The exhibition runs through Oct. 28.</p>
