        <p>WHEN I first came to New York, in 1985, a friend and I were sitting in what was then called the Kenny Scharf Room downstairs at the Palladium and this hip-looking old guy walked in with a gorgeous chick on each arm.</p>
        <p>It was Pierre Elliott Trudeau.</p>
        <p>That's my lasting memory of the late Canadian prime minister, whose recent death has been mourned fanatically in my native land, which I happened to visit last weekend. The television, radio and newspaper coverage of his legacy was nonstop. Beating the separatists. Bilingualism. Creating a national charter of rights. And most impressive of all, making Canada cool. He would have been 66 when I saw him, retired after almost 16 years in power and still making the scene.</p>
        <p>The man had style. Almost everything about him was the antithesis of the two men jogging for the presidency in this country. Not just his slightly pink politics and subversive sense of humor. ''An exciting party,'' he once declared, ''should have both blondes and brunettes.''  But he would never have shown up for a debate in the same suit and tie as his opponent.</p>
        <p>''Style is the man himself,'' Trudeau said, quoting Buffon, an 18th-century French aristocrat and polymath with whom he no doubt identified.</p>
        <p>Al Gore and George W. Bush play it pathologically safe. The archive pictures of Trudeau reprinted after his death are a rogue's gallery of sartorial bravado. Half the time he looks more like a pimp than a prime minister. A fedora and cape for a football game. A full-length fur to go ice-skating. A white jacket with the collar spread way outside the lapel for a photo op with Ronald Reagan. Ascots, buckskin fringe jackets, striped sailor shirts, berets, Eskimo garb -- he pulled it all off. In the worst fashion excesses of the 70's, he still looks hip.</p>
        <p>No consultant told him to make a red rose in his lapel his signature. He just did.</p>
        <p>Televised coverage of the Liberal Party convention at which Trudeau won the leadership was playing in the background of my sixth-birthday party. It must have had what Mr. Bush might call a ''subliminable'' effect, because 10 years later I had a big red Trudeau poster on the wall next to my bed, no doubt hoping that some of his legendary mojo would rub off.</p>
        <p>''The state,'' he famously decreed, ''has no business in the bedrooms of the nation.'' Yeah, baby!</p>
        <p>Court the women's vote? They chased him down the street! The word Trudeaumania was coined to account for the sexed-up wave of female adulation that swept him into power in 1968, when he was a 48-year-old academic.</p>
        <p>In a great picture from that year, the campaign bus has broken down and Trudeau is dancing what could be the mashed potato on the side of the highway with an ''unidentified woman.'' There are many such women in the archives. Jealous pundits joked, How could anybody who combs his hair like that be prime minister of Canada? As an early adopter of the Caesar look, he gave balding men hope.</p>
        <p>In 1968, The Daily Telegraph introduced British readers to Trudeau -- who was half Anglo- and half French-Canadian -- as ''a curious mixture of Left Bank and James Bond.'' What better role model for Canada's male youth than a swinger who jumped into his Mercedes convertible without opening the door? An article in The Globe and Mail last weekend recalled ''the ladies' man who served a roast chicken dinner to his Friday night date, chicken sandwiches to the beauty who turned up for lunch the next day and chicken soup to date No. 3.''</p>
        <p>Over his long career, Trudeau dated Barbra Streisand, Margot Kidder  and, of course, Margaret Sinclair, the ''flower child'' who would become Mrs. Trudeau when she was 22 and he 51. They met at a Club Med in Tahiti. Just 18 then, she was vacationing with her parents.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streisand said of her old boyfriend, ''He was unusual, an athlete with a poetic soul.'' His former wife (the couple divorced in 1984) called him ''a beautiful guy who taught me a lot about loving.''</p>
        <p>I'm proud to have had one girlfriend in common with the ''philosopher king,'' as he was known. Her identity? To reveal it would be ungentlemanly. But I will rule out anyone involved with the movie ''Yentl.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of his incorrigible dandyism and tendency to pirouette at state functions, a rumor once circulated that Trudeau was gay. Some poor reporter was charged with the task of obtaining a denial. Trudeau dared any man who made such an accusation to leave him alone with his wife for one hour.</p>
        <p>Confidence, not power, was his ultimate aphrodisiac. In The National Post, Sondra Gottlieb, the wife of the former Canadian ambassador to Washington, wrote that when Trudeau was a lowly parliamentary secretary, he could be standing alone at a party and within five minutes half the room would gather around him. ''Pierre Trudeau never had to work a room in his life,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Jesuits taught him discipline in high school in Montreal, where he excelled at diving, canoeing, skiing, gymnastics and judo, as well as academics. But he was also unpredictable (that is, un-Canadian).</p>
        <p>In 1944, he went to Mexico to learn Spanish but blew off the official itinerary to hitchhike across the country. After stints at Harvard, the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, he toured Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India, China and the Soviet Union. His high jinks bordered on the Hemingwayesque. In 1948, Yugoslavia expelled him as an Israeli spy, mostly because of his beatnik beard and biblical get-up. He got in trouble for throwing snowballs at a statue of Stalin in Red Square. And the United States Coast Guard picked him up off Key West, trying to row to Castro's Cuba.</p>
        <p>Marxism swayed his studies in Paris (they were putting something in the Gauloises back then) and appropriately, he defeated a Hegel scholar to win his first seat in Parliament. But he was also a devout Catholic, though he did not call Jesus Christ his favorite philosopher.</p>
        <p>Did he have a favorite? In The Globe and Mail, Ron Graham, an editor who once worked on a book with Trudeau, recalled quoting a line of Pascal to him one day over lunch.</p>
        <p>''Ah, yes -- Pascal,'' Trudeau replied. ''I used it once on a woman.'' In French, of course, ''It had its effect.''</p>
        <p>I wonder what he was wearing.</p>
        <p>TRIBUTE  Correction:  October 10, 2000, Tuesday  An article in Sunday Styles this week about the flamboyance of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the late Canadian prime minister, misspelled the surname of an author who is the wife of a former Canadian ambassador to Washington and who recently wrote about Mr. Trudeau's personal attractiveness. She is Sondra Gotlieb, not Gottlieb.</p>
