        <p>Eden White, a songwriter and singer, was married yesterday to Jed Ronald Morey, a radio executive. The Rev. E. Bonnie Goodwin, a Congregational minister, officiated at the Vanderbilt, a catering hall and concert venue in Plainview, N.Y., owned by the bridegroom's family.</p>
        <p>Ms. White, 30, also works in New York as an artists and repertory coordinator for the jazz and classics division of Capitol Records. She graduated from Tufts University. She is a daughter of Janice M. White, a social worker who lives in Centerville, Mass., and Dr. Allen J. White of Hyannis, Mass., who owns Health Management Associates, a company there that develops nursing homes and assisted living facilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morey, 27, is president of the Morey Organization, a family company based in Garden City, N.Y., that also owns the rock radio stations WLIR-FM and WXXP-FM on Long Island. He graduated from Skidmore College. He is a son of Brenda and Ronald J. Morey of Brookville, N.Y. His father founded the Morey Organization.</p>
        <p>The couple met two years ago at the Lilith Fair tour concert in Bryant Park in New York. After Mr. Morey watched Ms. White, the opening act, he used his radio station credentials to get backstage. ''I hung out like a groupie and tried to catch her eye,'' he recalled. ''I thought she was completely captivating.''</p>
