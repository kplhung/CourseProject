        <p>Shaquille O'Neal was pulverizing a platoon of Dallas Mavericks centers during a game last season when the 6-foot-3-inch guard Erick Strickland got an idea. Though 10 inches shorter and 105 pounds lighter than the Los Angeles Lakers' wonder, Strickland marched over to his exasperated coach, Don Nelson, and asked to guard O'Neal.</p>
        <p>''I said: 'Coach, put me in the game. I'll cover him,' '' Strickland recalled while recuperating from the first of two Knicks practices on Friday. ''He didn't dunk on me. Granted, Shaq's 300 pounds. He's going to do what he wants, and we had to double-team him. But I still took the challenge. I covered him for half a quarter, so I'm not scared of any challenge. I'm not scared of anything.''</p>

        <p>Shaquille O'Neal was pulverizing a platoon of Dallas Mavericks centers during a game last season when the 6-foot-3-inch guard Erick Strickland got an idea. Though 10 inches shorter and 105 pounds lighter than the Los Angeles Lakers' wonder, Strickland marched over to his exasperated coach, Don Nelson, and asked to guard O'Neal.</p>
        <p>''I said: 'Coach, put me in the game. I'll cover him,' '' Strickland recalled while recuperating from the first of two Knicks practices on Friday. ''He didn't dunk on me. Granted, Shaq's 300 pounds. He's going to do what he wants, and we had to double-team him. But I still took the challenge. I covered him for half a quarter, so I'm not scared of any challenge. I'm not scared of anything.''</p>
        <p>Not that Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy plans to have Strickland guard centers, but clearly the fearless guard is a player he could grow to love. The same heart, desire and combative spirit that made John Starks one of Van Gundy's favorite court warriors exist in Strickland.</p>
        <p>''Erick is a really tough kid,'' Van Gundy said. ''He plays extremely hard. He's my type of player.''</p>
        <p>The problem for Strickland is that the Knicks' perimeter is full of Van Gundy-type players. Already relegated to a backup's role, Strickland, who joined the Knicks on a draft-night trade last June, will have to compete for minutes with the starters Charlie Ward, Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell and the reserves Glen Rice and Chris Childs. When the Knicks traded for Strickland, who averaged 12.8 points and 4.8 rebounds last season as the Dallas starting shooting guard, the intent was for him to back up Houston, add juice to the Knicks practices by pushing the starters and to serve as insurance in case of injury.</p>
        <p>But the Knicks' subsequent trading of Patrick Ewing and addition of Rice, whose demand for minutes at small forward will give Sprewell more playing time in the backcourt, seems to imply that Strickland or Childs is in for lots of time on the bench.</p>
        <p>''You'd be less than truthful to say that when we traded for Glen Rice that it didn't hurt all the perimeter players' opportunities for minutes,'' Van Gundy said. ''So we'll find out who helps us win the most, and whoever that is, we'll play. Someone could argue that we're too deep. How it all works out now that we've traded for Glen, I can't tell you right now.''</p>
        <p>Strickland, who can opt out of his contract after this season, said, perhaps wishfully, that there is room for everyone to play.</p>
        <p>''I'm not even worried about minutes,'' Strickland said. ''I do a lot of different things on the court that I think they'll be able to use and I know I'll play. I'm not worried about Chris and Charlie. They're great players and we're all going to be played. We all do certain things and at different times we can use it to our advantage.''</p>
        <p>Strickland, 26, does a little bit of everything, which is what has enabled him to become a fifth-year veteran after going undrafted out of Nebraska and playing 16 games in the Continental Basketball Association in the 1996-97 season. He is more of a natural shooting guard who can go on big-time scoring binges. He had 36 points against Phoenix, 31 against New Jersey and 26 against San Antonio last season and averaged 15.4 points in helping the Mavericks to a 16-10 record over the last two months of the season.</p>
        <p>He is a solid 3-point shooter, hitting 39 percent from behind the arc last season, and he can use his muscle to get to the basket against smaller point guards and taller but thinner shooting guards. More than anything, Strickland is a terrific athlete who was an all-state performer in football, basketball and baseball as a high school senior in Nebraska.</p>
        <p>One of the top receivers in the nation, he was recruited to play football at Nebraska, Florida State and U.C.L.A., and was drafted in 1992 as an outfielder by the Florida Marlins, for whom he played two seasons of Class A ball. Strickland, who is built like a running back, said he decided to play basketball in college because of a shoulder injury he sustained in football.</p>
        <p>It's that all-around athletic experience that allows Strickland to mix it up with success against taller frontcourt players in the N.B.A. He is one of the best rebounders in the league among guards, and last season, he guarded San Antonio's Tim Duncan for the entire fourth quarter before tipping in the game-winning basket just before the buzzer sounded.</p>
        <p>''That comes from my whole background -- my baseball background, my football background, my father, the strength and the heart that he's instilled in me, and then my faith in God,'' said Strickland, whose father was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force. ''I fear no man.''</p>
        <p>With Houston and Sprewell ahead of him, Strickland's best bet for playing time with the Knicks is at point guard, where, despite his size, he needs the most work. He is a solid ballhandler, but distributing and running an offense do not come naturally to him. He has been turnover-prone at the point in scrimmages thus far, leading Van Gundy to make a joke on Friday, saying, ''He's a true Knick right now: he defends his butt off and he throws it away on every possession.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Coach JEFF VAN GUNDY said that MARCUS CAMBY would start at center in the Knicks' preseason opener against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden. Van Gundy, who praised Camby's play over the past few days, said he expected Camby to start during the regular season as well, though he cautioned that against dominating centers he might not start Camby to avoid getting him in early foul trouble. Van Gundy's decision gives the Knicks a starting five of Camby, LARRY JOHNSON, LATRELL SPREWELL, ALLAN HOUSTON and CHARLIE WARD. . . . Van Gundy said that the rookie LAVOR POSTELL was essentially assured of a spot on the roster. STEPHEN HOWARD and JOHN CELESTAND were waived. . . . The Knicks, who joined the NAACP's boycott of South Carolina last year and moved their training camp from Charleston, have drawn the group's fire for ignoring the boycott this year. The boycott is over the state's flying of the Confederate flag. The team said it had reached a compromise it knew would not be satisfactory to everyone.</p>
