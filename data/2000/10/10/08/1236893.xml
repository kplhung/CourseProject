        <p>With the quadrennial ritual of presidential debates now under way, the discussion has turned, as ever, to tangential matters like which candidate seems more statesmanlike and which one is more telegenic. But what of the debate itself? Do the televised exchanges between the two front-runners bear any relation to the ancient rhetorical art that bears the same name? And if so, what advice do its most skilled practitioners have to offer? We asked Christopher Park, a star of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society, and Michael Horowitz, a recent graduate of Emory and winner (with Jon Paul Lupo) of the 2000 National Debate Tournament, to share some of the secrets of their skills.</p>

        <p>With the quadrennial ritual of presidential debates now under way, the discussion has turned, as ever, to tangential matters like which candidate seems more statesmanlike and which one is more telegenic. But what of the debate itself? Do the televised exchanges between the two front-runners bear any relation to the ancient rhetorical art that bears the same name? And if so, what advice do its most skilled practitioners have to offer? We asked Christopher Park, a star of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society, and Michael Horowitz, a recent graduate of Emory and winner (with Jon Paul Lupo) of the 2000 National Debate Tournament, to share some of the secrets of their skills.</p>
        <p>Q: If you were coaching these two for the debates, what advice would you give them on their competitive strategy?</p>
        <p>Horowitz: I'd use the same catch phrases I use when I coach a high-school debate team. The first thing is: you can't debate to not lose. It's the worst thing you can do ever. You don't appear confident, and in an academic debate, it makes you look incompetent.</p>
        <p>Park: In parliamentary debate, we try to stress what we call signposting: making sure that you've prepackaged your terminology in a way that is concise and catchy enough that it can be very easily transcribed by the judges in a limited period of time. You want to limit the amount of interpretation and editorializing that the judge does. In this case, you obviously don't have formal judges, but you don't want to be putting too much power in the hands of the audience to make their own impressions.</p>
        <p>Horowitz: I tell my debaters that it's all about debating on your ground and not on your opponent's ground. And you've got to point out the contradictions in your opponent's arguments, because then you're using your opponents arguments against them.</p>
        <p>Park: Right. During the course of a competitive debate round, when you have prolonged speeches and issue-oriented, rapid-fire exchange of individual contradictions and line-by-line rebuttals, what ultimately decides these things is what we call crystallization -- being able to make holistic summaries of the jumble that you've heard. What distinguishes the presidential debates from ours is that they have to crystallize constantly throughout the round, because they have shorter periods of time to speak, so each of their sound bites shouldn't just be an issue but should be related back to some ideological or philosophical backbone.</p>
        <p>Horowitz: In policy debate, we call crystallization ''overviews.'' At the top of your last rebuttal speech, you try to explain very concisely in 30 seconds why you're winning. I think that stepping back from the lingo and the ''line by line'' and analyzing in a broader sense why you're winning -- that's the most important part of debate, what separates good debaters from great debaters. Good debaters can say: Here's your answer. Here's my answer. Great debaters can step back and look at the big picture and figure out how arguments interrelate and explain what that means.</p>
        <p>Park: Right. Though I'd be surprised and disappointed to hear a candidate say, ''Well, let me refer you back to my signpost'' or ''Now I'd like to crystallize.'' These are techniques we have catch phrases for, but they can very easily be adapted into conversational vernacular. One variable will be in the audience. I remember over the summer when I was really bored, I watched an old C-Span telecast of the Reagan-Mondale debate.</p>
        <p>Horowitz: You must have been really bored.</p>
        <p>Park: I had the flu, which was my justification. But I noticed the mediators continually asked the audience not to chime in with applause, and the audience ignored them. So the audience can play an unforeseen role.</p>
        <p>We tell our younger debaters, Don't be afraid to float an idea, to play with an argument, see what the audience reaction is and then adjust accordingly.</p>
        <p>Q: What would you tell the candidates to do to psych themselves up?</p>
        <p>Park: I think -- Mike, maybe you'll disagree -- especially in our higher profile rounds, it's almost more important to psyche yourself down and to stay calm.</p>
        <p>Horowitz: Yeah. In a large-scale debate situation, I always thought you had to have ice in your veins. And getting too caught up in minutiae of debate preparation can only lead to failure.</p>
        <p>Park: Right. And I think the most effective rhetorical flourishes are probably the most inadvertent. So rather than try to think ahead and kind of plan for a one-liner, they're probably better off just trying to be spontaneous. A lot of debaters believe that the harder you try to be funny, the less successful you are.</p>
        <p>Horowitz: I don't know. One of the best debate teams I ever saw used to write down their jokes before a tournament. I think the same may be true for Bush and Gore in terms of key phrases. In terms of persuasive flourishes, how you hold yourself in a debate, making eye contact, things like that, you're right: you can't really practice that. You can't look in the mirror and go, ''Ooh, I look credible today.''</p>
        <p>Q: What if during a debate someone gets in a real zinger, a ''You're no John Kennedy'' line? How should a candidate respond?</p>
        <p>Park: Do as much damage control as possible -- and realize your chances of coming up with a rejoinder that has more impact are very slim. But I'd be surprised if the debaters can tell which moments are, in fact, big.</p>
        <p>Horowitz: You know, one of the best tactics out in the real world for disarming your opponent is to not blow them off, but to make their argument seem not credible, like ''that's a joke.'' Very rarely do politicians take that tack. Humor's a powerful weapon.</p>
