        <p>Air France and British Airways are seeking ways to keep the loyalty of their most lucrative passengers, those who shuttled across the North Atlantic on the supersonic Concordes, which have been grounded since a July 25 crash near Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris that killed 113 people.</p>
        <p>It cost about $10,000 round trip to fly on the Concorde, but the ability to cross the North Atlantic and return in a day built a cadre of customers for the two airlines, helping them sell these same passengers lucrative first-  and business-class seats on other routes.</p>

        <p>Air France and British Airways are seeking ways to keep the loyalty of their most lucrative passengers, those who shuttled across the North Atlantic on the supersonic Concordes, which have been grounded since a July 25 crash near Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris that killed 113 people.</p>
        <p>It cost about $10,000 round trip to fly on the Concorde, but the ability to cross the North Atlantic and return in a day built a cadre of customers for the two airlines, helping them sell these same passengers lucrative first-  and business-class seats on other routes.</p>
        <p>Air France said that on Oct. 29 it will add a flight that departs from Paris at 8:30 a.m. and is scheduled to land at Kennedy Airport at 10:50 a.m. Currently Air France's earliest flights from Paris arrive at 12:25 p.m. at Newark and 1:10 p.m. at Kennedy.</p>
        <p>British Airways said that to help retain its Concorde customers it expanded its Club World business-class cabin with 32 additional seats on two of its daily flights between Kennedy and Heathrow Airport outside London. The expansion was scheduled to be completed by the middle of September.</p>
        <p>Air France does not plan to expand its first-  and business-class cabins, said Diane Cornman, a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Raymond L. Neidl, a travel industry analyst at the ING Barings securities brokerage, said that with all flights now subsonic,  there will be efforts by competitors to lure away Concorde regulars. He said that American Airlines is the carrier most likely to benefit from the Concorde's being grounded, but added that ''so many people needed the time the Concorde saved to justify trips that a lot of business may just be lost.''</p>
