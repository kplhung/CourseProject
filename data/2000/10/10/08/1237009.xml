        <p>WHEN Lorenzo Papa was a boy, he loved professional wrestling, and so did his dad.</p>
        <p>His father would brag that he knew the famous wrestler Bruno Sammartino and often took Lorenzo to the Westchester County Center to see wrestling shows.</p>
        <p>Now he wishes he hadn't.</p>
        <p>Lorenzo's enthusiasm for wrestling grew as he got older, and so did his parents' dismay. They had immigrated here from Italy as teenagers, and his father made a hard living in the garment industry and moved his family to a decent working-class neighborhood in Port Chester.</p>
        <p>''In high school they'd ask me, 'Why are you still watching this?' said Mr. Papa, now 25, ''and then in college they'd say, 'Why are you still watching this?' ''</p>
        <p>But they knew the answer: their son wanted to become a pro wrestler. Still, Mr. Papa graduated from Syracuse University with a business degree and took a job selling advertisements for The Journal News. But this year he quit his job to concentrate on becoming a wrestler.</p>
        <p>For young, college-educated men from Westchester, pro wrestling may not be a typical career choice. But Mr. Papa and a group of his friends all aspire to be wrestlers. He practices with others from the New Rochelle area, all of whom work side jobs -- a college admissions officer, a custodian, a health food store manager -- while trying to become wrestlers.</p>
        <p>''We were all bitten with the bug when we were kids and never grew out of it,'' Mr. Papa said. ''Most people think pro wrestlers are trailer park kids who can't do anything else, but you can't be a dummy and do this well.''</p>
        <p>His father, however, does not agree. He is so incensed about his son's decision that he refuses to hear, see or speak about wrestling anymore. He has never been to one of his son's matches and has urged him to return to The Journal News.</p>
        <p>''If I'm watching it on TV, he leaves the room.'' Mr. Papa said. ''He says, 'How you gonna buy an engagement ring? How you gonna buy a house?' '' But Mr. Papa's mind is only on the kind of ring with ropes around it and money and fame inside.</p>
        <p>Every wrestler plays a character. Mr. Papa has two, one good and one bad. When he plays the ''heel,'' the bad guy, he is Lil' Papa. Lil' Papa has a shaved head, a leopard-print singlet and black pants and boots and will use any dirty trick to win. Lil' Papa taunts the crowd by calling everyone in their town ugly. Ultimately, Li'l Papa cowers and loses in the ring. When he plays the good guy, he is Rick Phoenix, an all-American hero who wears a phoenix emblem on his shirt and always rises victorious from the ashes of his opponent's bad sportsmanship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papa is a decent wrestler physically, but more important, he is a good showman. Also, he thinks like an entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>In high school he created Jello Mania, a wrestling match between students and teachers in a tub of green gelatin. He got teachers to wrestle students and raised money by selling ads for a program he created.</p>
        <p>More recently he made good money as a party promoter for nightclubs in Manhattan, but wrestling has kept him from the necessary mingling and schmoozing to do well. Money is tight now. He lives with his parents and performs in small-town wrestling shows every few weeks, but the pay barely covers gas money.</p>
        <p>Still, he knows the time has never been better to turn his obsession into cash.</p>
        <p>Pro wrestling has exploded in recent years. Both the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling regularly sell out arenas. Wrestlers are writing best-selling memoirs and becoming politicians, actors and recording artists.</p>
        <p>Wrestlers who make it on television usually sign contracts for at least $100,000 their first year. And established stars are millionaires through performance contracts, endorsements and merchandising.</p>
        <p>Still, on the flip side, the chances of hitting the big time are remote. There are only about 150 wrestlers in those two leagues combined, and many thousands are trying to break in.</p>
        <p>''I know the odds are a billion to one, but I don't want to hear it,'' Mr. Papa said. ''There are millions of people trying to become actors, and you don't go telling them they won't make it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Papa began watching wrestling on Saturday mornings when he was in fourth grade. ''My jaw dropped; I was mesmerized,'' he recalled. ''I watched once, and I was hooked. It gets into your blood like an addiction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Papa has piles of snapshots of himself from the 1980's, posing with wrestlers like Sergeant Slaughter, Dusty Rhodes, Bob Backlund and King Kong Bundy. He bought dozens of wrestling dolls and went to hundreds of matches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papa was the biggest child in his class up until high school. Then he stopped growing, and since there were few small pro wrestlers in those days, he packed away the dream and joined the high school wrestling and football teams.</p>
        <p>But in recent years, there has been more opportunity for smaller pro wrestlers, often called highfliers, who do flips and leaps from the top ropes of the ring. And Mr. Papa, who is 5-foot-6 and 175 pounds, can do them. He has always loved working a crowd. He acted in dozens of school plays and ran for student office in order to make speeches.</p>
        <p>''I've always known how to take a mike and -- what we call in wrestling -- get over,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His most vivid childhood memories are of being on the floor of the Meadowlands arena with tens of thousands of screaming fans cheering larger-than-life super heroes standing on turnbuckles.</p>
        <p>As a teenager he would sneak backstage at the County Center during wrestling shows and stand in the corner mesmerized, watching the wrestlers. ''I was more interested in what they were doing behind the scenes than in the ring,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In those days, many of the wrestlers drove Cadillacs, and Mr. Papa found that he could gain entry to the wrestlers' parking area in his parents' Cadillac.</p>
        <p>He would park wrestlers' cars for them and often drive them to different places in town and wait while they ate post-match meals, not in their spandex and boots, but in their jeans, polo shirts and loafers.</p>
        <p>Now he has gotten his own taste of fan adoration, and he likes it. At a recent show in New Rochelle, he sat at an autograph table and ''couldn't give my pictures away.'' After performing, however, he was mobbed on his way out by about 30 children asking for his autograph.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papa works out with weights five days a week at a gym in Port Chester, and he goes to wrestling practice four days a week at the Johnny Rodz Wrestling School at Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>There, in knee pads, high-top sneakers and workout clothes, aspiring wrestlers drill moves for hours on end, learning how to roll when landing and slap the mat to make it sound like a big slam. They learn how to throw and take fake punches and kicks.</p>
        <p>Johnny Rodz's real name is Johnny Rodriguez. He is a member of the World Wrestling Federation Hall of Fame and has run the school for 16 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodz, a former recruiter for wrestling promoters, still has connections in the business. Several of his students are now in Extreme Championship Wrestling, a nationally televised league started by Paul Heyman of Scarsdale, and two students, Devon Dudley from New Rochelle and Tazz from Brooklyn, are W.W.F. stars.</p>
        <p>When league executives call looking for recruits, Mr. Rodz recommends his top students. Now Mr. Papa is at the top of the class, Mr. Rodz said, and ''has a good shot'' at making it to a pro league.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows wrestling is fake, but it is also dangerous. Pile drivers, low blows and eye gouges all take their toll. Mr. Papa can barely get out of bed the morning after a practice, and the shows leave him bruised for weeks. He has friends from Westchester with metal rods in their legs from wrestling injuries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papa has cut himself with hidden razor blades during matches to start bleeding for the crowd. Recently, an opponent tried a power bomb, slamming Mr. Papa head first to the mat, causing three bulging disks in his neck. That needed several months of physical therapy.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, at an exhibition at Gleason's, Mr. Papa fell from the ring and landed head first on the concrete. For minutes, he could not feel his arms or legs. He gashed his head and got 16 stitches.</p>
        <p>''It's repetitive, it's dangerous and it hurts, but it's fun,'' he said recently, driving his Jeep Cherokee in traffic home from Gleason's. Practice at Gleason's takes about six hours out of his day.</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot of my time, and it's a big investment that may never add up to anything,'' he said. ''But when you step out of that curtain and see the crowd, it's such a boost of adrenaline, there's nothing like it.''</p>
        <p>That was the situation recently at a show Mr. Papa helped organize at a church bazaar in Port Chester.</p>
        <p>As a fat man in overalls and a midget helped set up a wrestling ring on a crab grass outfield next to the Fun Slide, Mr. Papa paced nearby on his cell phone, giving directions to the guys coming from Brooklyn. Then the midget wanted to know where the nearest strip club was.</p>
        <p>Inside the church's basement bingo hall, it looked like a carnival dressing room: midgets, fat men, guys in capes and muscle men in singlets pumping iron barbells. They slopped on baby oil to make the muscles glisten and wrapped their wrists and ankles in shiny black electrical tape. Other accessories include knee pads, sunglasses, bandannas, tattoos, hockey masks and gold championship belts.</p>
        <p>Beneath the large bingo sign, a row of elderly church ladies in aprons stood at long tables kneading dough for the zeppole booth and explaining to the midgets how zeppoles are made.</p>
        <p>A large bearded man in his 50's unpacked his duffel bag, laying his gold watch on top of red canvas high-top sneakers and denim overalls. It was Hillbilly Cousin Luke, a W.W.F. Hall of Famer and one of the luminaries hired to draw fans to the event. Another was Jimmy (Superfly) Snuka, another Hall of Famer, known for his soaring dives off the turnbuckle in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Snuka, who kept stepping out for cigarette breaks, looked like an Indian chief. He smiled but said nothing as fans came up to shake his big, weathered hands. He spent about 10 minutes in the ring and then sold photographs and autographs at a carnival booth for $10 each.</p>
        <p>Just before going out, the wrestlers planned their matches. And got a pep talk from the musclebound Mr. Rodz, dressed in a pink guayabera and black slacks. No profanity, he says. It is a church event, but more importantly, a videotape of the event will be given to pro league promoters.</p>
        <p>''If you have to use a chair, keep it in the ring,'' he says. ''I have a good feeling about this,'' he told the ambitious young wrestlers. ''A lot of you could get picked up soon by W.C.W. Maybe you, or you, or you.''</p>
        <p>Then the wrestlers storm the ring, leap-frogging and hip-tossing one another and doing arm drags, powder-outs, Irish whips, clean-houses and double ax-handle dominators. The bleachers are packed with hundreds of fairgoers eating calzones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papa runs out wearing his old blue Port Chester High School football jersey. The young crowd begins to boo and jeer. He chugs from a water bottle and spits streams of water at them. He leaps into the ring like a swaggering villain and further taunts the crowd, mostly residents of Port Chester. He plays on the contempt that residents sometimes have for higher-income towns nearby.</p>
        <p>''I hated this town growing up, and I still hate it,'' he yells. ''In fact, when people ask me where I'm from, I say Rye.''</p>
        <p>The crowd erupts in boos, Mr. Papa tears off his Port Chester High School jersey and begins stomping and spitting on it. He calls Port Chester ''a town full of losers'' and adds that ''the only good thing to come outta this town is me.''</p>
        <p>The fans erupt in a frenzy of boos, some light-hearted and some not. In fact, after the show he would get phone calls from some spectators berating him for bad mouthing Port Chester.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Papa and his partner begin to beat their good-guy opponents senseless. Mr. Papa flips his man and fakes a yawn to the crowd. He spits in his opponent's face and flings him into the ropes.</p>
        <p>As he rebounds back, Mr. Papa leaps in the air and lands a flying kick with both feet to his head. Then he climbs the turnbuckle and dives into the air.</p>
        <p>For a moment, he seems to float high above the canvas, buoyed by the screams of hundreds of wrestling fans. Hanging against a backdrop of spectators, their mouths agape, he is no longer just another kid from Port Chester. Now other fathers and sons are watching him.</p>
        <p>He crashes back down to the canvas, delivering a vicious body slam, and the crowd groans.</p>
        <p>Of course, the tide inevitably turns, and soon the good guy is holding Mr. Papa above his head and spinning him. The crowd roars, and a grown man in a polo shirt and penny loafers jumps to his feet, cheering. Mr. Papa gets thrown out of the ring and falls about 10 feet to the grass. He and his partner scamper away in defeat.</p>
        <p>Win or lose, Mr. Papa loves to be in the ring and said he has no intention of giving up his dream, despite his parents' wishes.</p>
        <p>''I can understand my parents' reaction,'' he said. ''They sacrificed a lot to put me through college, and now they think I'm wasting it.''</p>
        <p>But he added, ''It's the only thing I want to do with my life.</p>
