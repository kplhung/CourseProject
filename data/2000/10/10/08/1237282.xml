        <p>An 11-year-old boy walking home from school on Friday was wounded by a stray bullet fired during a fight between two gangs on a major Queens thoroughfare, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The youngster was on his way home from Public School 86 in the Briarwood section of Queens about 3:30 p.m. Friday when he was shot in front of 87-85 Parsons Boulevard, near Hillside Avenue, the police said.</p>
        <p>The boy, Binnay Rodriguez, who lives a few blocks from where he was shot, was taken to St. Vincents Medical Center-Mary Immaculate Division, where he was listed in stable condition. A small-caliber bullet lodged in soft tissue just beneath the skin in his neck.</p>
        <p>''He's quite lucky,'' said Dr. Neil M. Richards, the hospital's director of trauma surgery. He said the boy would probably be released today. '' He's a brave little tough guy, but very respectful,'' Dr. Richards said.</p>
        <p>Detectives canvassed the area where the shooting had occurred. They said they believed that it had stemmed from a dispute between two gangs, the Latin Kings and another group called Money Over Bitches, or M.O.B. Two .22-caliber shell casings were found. The incident is being investigated by detectives from the 103rd Precinct and the gang investigation division.</p>
