      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The writing portion of the standardized state tests given to New Jersey's public school fourth graders for the past two years has been evaluated again with a kinder, gentler grading system. In most districts, scores improved for both 1999 and 2000 under the new system. In the last two years, the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment scores in writing were so low that a number of administrators, parents and teachers began to question the validity of the test. When the State Department of Education released scores in other subjects in August, it withheld the language arts scores because on some writing questions where students could score zero to four points, almost 75 percent got one point or less on several items.</p>
