        <p>FOR those who want to hear music as clearly from their Discmans as they would in a recording studio, Dolby and Lake Technologies Ltd. have come up with what they call Dolby Headphone technology.</p>
        <p>The technology, which will be licensed to consumer electronics manufacturers, gives listeners ''the illusion that they are surrounded by five speakers, or in a recording studio.'' said its chief developer, David McGrath, research director at Lake Technology, which is based in Sydney, Australia.</p>

        <p>FOR those who want to hear music as clearly from their Discmans as they would in a recording studio, Dolby and Lake Technologies Ltd. have come up with what they call Dolby Headphone technology.</p>
        <p>The technology, which will be licensed to consumer electronics manufacturers, gives listeners ''the illusion that they are surrounded by five speakers, or in a recording studio.'' said its chief developer, David McGrath, research director at Lake Technology, which is based in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>''Listening to music designed for speakers on headphones is not the way the original creator of the music intended it,'' Mr. McGrath said. ''Headphones have been broken ever since they were first invented,'' he added, meaning that the sound quality has been inadequate.</p>
        <p>To achieve such sharp and clear head phones into a five-channel listening experience, Mr. McGrath said, a chip is added to a DVD player or headphones, or software is added to a personal computer.</p>
        <p>Nine years in development at Lake Technologies, the sound processing system was sold two years ago to Dolby, which is based in San Francisco. It is already being sold in personal computers in Japan and should be available in DVD players and headphones in the United States early next year. A headphones plug-in for the Real Jukebox Player, for example, will cost $19.95. In a DVD player, it may be included in the package. For PC's with a DVD drive, the headphones will be $39.95.</p>
        <p>The headphone technology represents ''a mathematical algorithm which adds an extra function to a DVD player or home theater receiver,'' Mr. McGrath said. ''It really means the amplifier that drives your speakers comes built into your DVD or audio visual receiver,'' he added. ''It does its little piece of magic.''</p>
