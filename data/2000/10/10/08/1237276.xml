        <p>Brown flanker Stephen Campbell, who made a team-record 19 receptions a week ago, had eight more yesterday against Fordham at Jack Coffey Field. But his biggest play of the day came on a kickoff that he ran back 83 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>That touchdown -- Campbell's first ever on a kickoff return -- came after Fordham had come back from a 21-0 first-quarter deficit to trail by only 21-14. The return was also the first of three touchdowns that the Bears (3-1) scored in the second half en route to a 44-17 victory.</p>
        <p>''Campbell's kickoff return was a back breaker after we had pulled to within 7,'' said Dave Clawson, the second-year Fordham coach. ''Our kids missed a lot of tackles on that runback. But I'm proud of the way we battled back.''</p>
        <p>Fordham's special teams also missed more than a few tackles when Brandon Buchanan ran back the game's opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. That 7-0 lead quickly increased to 21-0 when Brown converted an interception into a 2-yard touchdown run by tailback Mike Malan and quarterback Eric Webber connected with Campbell on a 20-yard scoring pass less than 10 minutes into the game.</p>
        <p>But after four consecutive interceptions, Fordham (2-4) managed a 13-play, 65-yard drive that ended when tailback Arthur Gaskin scored from 7 yards out with 2 minutes 37 seconds left in the first half.</p>
        <p>Two passes by Mike Mucci, Fordham's freshman quarterback, accounted for 57 yards on the Rams' second scoring drive, which also covered 65 yards. It culminated with a 1-yard plunge by Mucci in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>But then the 6-foot-3-inch 200-pound Campbell, who was leading Division I-AA in receptions and receiving yards per game, scooped up a squib kick by Brian Colsant on the Brown 17 and sidestepped his way 83 yards down the right side for the touchdown.</p>
        <p>''I just followed my blockers all the way,'' said Campbell who, through Brown's first three games, had averaged 12.5 receptions and 121 receiving yards. ''I got some great blocks along the way.''</p>
        <p>Campbell had 8 catches yesterday for 96 yards. After benefiting from the passing of James Perry, who broke 17 Ivy League records before graduating last spring, Campbell is thriving in tandem with Webber, a senior. Webber started yesterday's game as the top passer in Division I-AA with an average of 32 completions and 348 yards passing a game. Yesterday, he completed 23 of 39 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions.</p>
        <p>Malan, who rushed for a career-high 216 yards against Fordham last year, amassed 129 yards on 39 carries yesterday. His last carry resulted in his second score of the day, a 13-yard run that was Brown's final touchdown.</p>
        <p>Mucci was hurt by three interceptions, two deep in Brown territory, and by about a half-dozen dropped passes. He completed 15 of 32 throws for 151 yards and ran nine times, usually out of necessity, for 26 yards.</p>
        <p>''Brown has as good a collection of skilled guys as we'll probably see all year,'' Clawson said. ''But we hurt ourselves by tackling poorly, especially on special teams. And we didn't play very smart football.''  COLLEGE FOOTBALL</p>
