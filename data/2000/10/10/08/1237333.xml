        <p>It was beyond Clinton-Lazio. Higher than Wall Street. Deeper than Hamlet moralizing over dead Ophelia.

        <p>It was beyond Clinton-Lazio. Higher than Wall Street. Deeper than Hamlet moralizing over dead Ophelia. It was a gorgeous autumn Saturday for baseball, the Yankees and the Mets were in town for crucial playoff games on the same day, and for New Yorkers dreaming of a Subway Series little else mattered.</p>
        <p>''This is shaping up to be the best weekend of my life as a sports fan,'' said Paul McPolin, 34, who had tickets to the Mets games Saturday and today. ''I think sports fans are definitely jacked up about this stuff. People saw the promise of a Subway Series last year, and the dream is alive again.''</p>
        <p>There had never been two baseball playoff games in New York on the same day, although the Yankees had faced the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants in separate crosstown World Series years ago, before there were division playoff games. And baseball fever was running at least as high as it was this past July 8, when the Mets and Yankees played the city's first split-park major league doubleheader in nearly a century.</p>
        <p>Clad in Mets and Yankees paraphernalia, nearly 110,000 fans streamed into Shea and Yankee Stadiums yesterday for the late-afternoon Mets game with San Francisco and the Yankees night game with Oakland, and countless thousands more watched the doubleheader at home or in jammed sports bars.</p>
        <p>The Mets kept their World Series hopes alive with a stunning 3-2 victory in the 13th inning last night. The Mets' afternoon start ran well into the Yankees' game, and fans at home were forced to use their remote to flip between the two games -- the Mets on Fox and the Yankees on NBC. Crowds in sports bars were luckier because they could watch the games on different televisions.</p>
        <p>An informal survey turned up plenty of bravado and no lack of contempt between the rivals. But for many fans -- towel-waving shriekers who normally give no quarter to the enemy -- there was a strange spirit of generosity, even civic boosterism, at large: Yankee fans rooting for the Mets, and vice-versa, temporarily of course, all in the interest of promoting a crosstown World Series, or at least having a New York team in the championship.</p>
        <p>''If it can't be the Yankees, God forbid, then I hope it's the Mets because it's still New York,'' said Jamie Ward, 19, of Mastic, N.Y., who arrived at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx with her mother and brother, all three in matching Yankee sweat shirts. ''No matter what, you always root for New York.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Menezes, 49, who lives in Flushing near Shea Stadium but has been a Yankees fan since coming to New York from Pakistan 16 years ago, raved about the recent performance of the Mets, especially their 10th-inning victory over the Giants on Thursday night. ''I couldn't sleep that night,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jeff Rosenberg, 28, a Mets fan from Queens, said: ''It's a chance for the fans of both teams to swagger a bit. People seem to be having a good time with it. They're forgetting about their own problems for a little while, and it's all New Yorkers, not just Yankee fans or Mets fans.''</p>
        <p>Rosenberg, a sanitation worker, said he had noticed something else in recent days around town -- a kind of old-fashioned upbeat feeling. ''You can tell people are in better spirits,'' he said. ''They'll say 'How you doing today?' It brings out a little pride. I can see that just walking through the streets.''</p>
        <p>Outside Yankee Stadium yesterday, as game time approached and the crowds swelled, Eric Millard, 27, and his wife, Aimee, 25, of Norwalk, Conn., spoke of the excitement. ''The energy in the crowd is amazing,'' Aimee Millard said. ''It's wonderful. It definitely makes a difference that they're both playing at home.''</p>
        <p>In the Pennants Fever Sports Bar on Northern Boulvard in Flushing, Kenneth Mangus, 50, of Forest Hills, said: ''I'm a Yankee fan from way back, but I want to see the Mets win. This would be the greatest thing that ever transpired, reliving the 50's: the Yankees versus the Dodgers, the Yankees versus the Giants, and now the Yankees versus the Mets.''</p>
        <p>At a ticket window at Shea, Kevin Goldstein, 37, of Manhattan, held his 9-month-old daughter, Eleanor, in his arms and the leash of his poodle, Mookie Wilson, whose namesake is a Mets coach and was the center fielder of the 1986 world championship Mets. As he bought tickets, Goldstein bounced Eleanor gently and sang to her: ''Let's go Mets! Let's go Mets!'' She beamed, revealing a tooth.</p>
        <p>It was a day made for baseball. Brilliant sunlight cast long shadows during the afternoon game at Shea, while a white-glove half moon rode over Yankee Stadium in the nightcap. The October air was brisk, and there was a timelessness about the settings, as if the outfields were forever green, the grandstands always packed and the scoreboard endlessly set in favor of the home team.</p>
        <p>At midafternoon, long before the crowds began streaming into Yankee Stadium, three boys played ball on a vacant lot nearby off River Avenue. They had a couple of gloves, a bat and what looked like an old rubber Spaldeen. Elvin Rojas, 12, and Daniel Delgado, 13, did the pitching and hitting, while Julio Sanchez, 8, had to shag the fly balls.</p>
        <p>Amid the chatter, it was not hard to see the idols at work -- Bernie Williams loping like a deer in the Yankee outfield, the Mets' Edgardo Alfonzo calm as a cat at the plate. The boys could also imagine a Subway Series. ''You'll have all of New York in one stadium,'' Daniel said. ''It'll be like a million people.''</p>
