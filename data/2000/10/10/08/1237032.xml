        <p>MIDTOWN  Your Space or Mine: Sympathy for the Pedestrian</p>
        <p>Public plazas and atriums have become fixtures in New York,  spurred by zoning changes in 1961 that offered pedestrians breathing room as a tradeoff for taller towers. But questions have been raised as to their success. Most recently a study supported by the Municipal Art Society found that nearly half of the city's 503 public plazas and atriums did not comply with city rules.</p>
        <p>The legacy of and impact of these privately owned public spaces is being examined in the Municipal Art Society's exhibition ''The World's Most Expensive Public Space.'' It  features photographs, models, drawings and maps of 300 of these spaces. In addition, a series of public programs on the topic will include walking tours, a panel discussion and symposium, and a film screening.</p>

        <p>FLUSHING MEADOWS  A Borough's History, The Jazz Version</p>
        <p>The Astoria Jazz Band is an offshoot of the Astoria Big Band, which was founded in 1986 by Carol Sudhalter, a baritone saxophonist. The 12-piece jazz band (pictured below) was formed out of the desire to perform big-band-style music at places  that could not hold 16 musicians. The band has produced two recordings, ''Soon'' and ''Who Will Buy.''</p>
        <p>This Saturday the jazz band will perform its original composition ''Queens: A Jazz History of the Borough Through the Music and Memories of Leonard Gaskin, Bassist.''</p>
        <p>The concert presents the history through narration by Mr. Gaskin, a bassist and 30-year resident of the borough. He has performed with Louis Armstrong's All Stars and jazz greats like Dizzy Gillespie and Dexter Gordon.</p>

        <p>CENTRAL PARK  Bang the Drum Gladly, In Celebration of the Spirit</p>
        <p>Visitors can drum, sing and dance on Saturday at the New York Drumming Circle's Second Annual Shamanic Circle Gathering. For the last three years, members of the Drumming Circle have been studying with teachers known as shamans from the Amazon and the high Andes of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
        <p>Saturday's event is a celebration of the spirit world, and the public is  invited to take a rattle or a drum, or a notepad and a pencil, or a bandanna and a blanket. Picnics are encouraged but alcohol is prohibited.</p>
