        <p>Sweetly oblivious to the ichthyological metaphors so often heard in the workplace, a trade association for pet supply makers is trying to promote Wednesday, Oct. 25, as ''Take a Fish to Work Day.''</p>
        <p>Representatives of the group, the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, will spend a few hours that morning in the Empire State Building in New York and at a Chicago location to be determined, handing out free tropical fish and starter kits.</p>
        <p>Pets in general and fish in particular are a calming influence in a busy workplace, according to the group.</p>
        <p>The people at Freshwater Software in Boulder, Colo., certainly believe it. At their six-month-old headquarters, aquariums are used instead of cubicle walls to divide an otherwise open office area into personal spaces for the company's 48 employees. ''Our desks are organized in a wavelike fashion,'' said Jacqueline Anderson, the director of marketing, ''and on top of each desk is a very large fish tank. They are soothing and fun to look at.''</p>
        <p>The company, which makes tools for monitoring Web site reliability, has no chief aquatic officer; the job of maintaining the tanks is outsourced. But one employee has volunteered to feed the fish daily. And there haven't been any wisecracks from visitors about swimming with the barracudas, or piranhas, or sharks, Ms. Anderson said: ''Everyone who walks in comments on how calm and peaceful it is.''</p>
