        <p>After a stormy week, analysts saw little in the near-term to soothe the jarred psyches of investors, who watched both the upstanding Dow drop and the frontier-town Nasdaq get pummeled.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, but it remained on guard against inflation by continuing its stated bias toward higher rates -- despite mixed signals on just how much the economy may be slowing. For traders besieged by earnings warnings, news that the Fed was not yet considering interest rate cuts was unsettling.</p>
        <p>But stocks, especially in the new-economy sector, are also suffering a hangover from their own valuation brew. Lower profits, steep energy prices and the possibility of higher rates will all exact tolls.</p>
        <p>What's happening is exactly what chairman Greenspan would like to see: the market is deflating the tech bubble, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Banks, who predicted that the downturn was not yet over.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq skidded 8.5 percent this week, to 3,361.012, while the Dow industrials were hurt less, falling only 0.5 percent, to 10,596.54.</p>
