        <p>This is what television has taught me about race in my own country. I am a 42-year-old American and I am white and this is what I've learned from a lifetime of situation comedies and one-hour cop dramas and commercials and those earnest documentaries and from the evening news and from UPN and from Bill Cosby and Flip Wilson and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and from Heckle and Jeckle and from the Olympics and from the N.B.A. According to my television, black people can be many things in our modern America. To the television industry, though, and to the men and women responsible for what it manufactures, they always seem to be only that, black people. Never just people.</p>
        <p>This is one point, I think, among several being made by the terrifying TV minstrel show in Spike Lee's new film ''Bamboozled,'' which opened Friday. An indictment with the feel, if not the scope, of ''Network'' or ''A Face in the Crowd,'' it is another murderous satire in the long tradition of the movies' sly condemnation of the evil, ignorance and absurdity inherent in their bastard stepchild, commercial television.</p>
        <p>The premise of the film is simple and gallingly probable: a self-loathing black television writer (Damon Wayans) is ordered by his white network boss and frantic, aspirant homey (Michael Rapaport) to develop an urban (read ''black'') hit series. The writer, in a pointed act of career suicide, delivers ''Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show'' -- a blackface variety show, a ''coon show'' right down to the chickens and the watermelons and the bug-eyed plantation patter, starring two street performers (Savion Glover as Mantan and Tommy Davidson as Sleep 'n' Eat). Inevitably, it becomes the hottest show on TV.</p>
        <p>That this deeply flawed medium, television, was the gravest missed opportunity of the 20th century was agreed upon decades ago by the big thinkers and academics who decide such things. Television might have become the most powerful instrument in history for education or human betterment or cultural enrichment. Instead it was co-opted by Madison Avenue to become just another advertising tool, a boorish sideshow for the puerile amusement and systematic fleecing of the rubes. As an engine for our national economy, a device to sell more headache powder and pancake batter and fabric softener, it was, and remains, unrivaled.</p>
        <p>More ominous in those long ago, three network days was its unprecedented ability to concentrate the nation's attention, to create or destroy figures of national stature, stars or demagogues, overnight. (More accurately, with the overnight ratings.) For every Uncle Miltie there was a Joe McCarthy, and the danger of early television often lay in its inability (or unwillingness) to distinguish or differentiate between the two. This Newtonian cycle of action and reaction, of electronic creation and destruction was first and most beautifully attacked by Budd Schulberg in his screenplay for ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957). Of the great movies about television, it is the most chilling because it is the most plausible.</p>
        <p>It chronicles the rise to ratings gigantism of a bumpkin savant by the name of Lonesome Rhodes. Mr. Schulberg and the director Elia Kazan get the Nietzschean peapicker and crackerbarrel fascist Rhodes (Andy Griffith) from the outhouse to the penthouse to the front door of the White House and back again in two hours. That your favorite performer was not what he seemed, but turned out in fact to be a megalomaniacal sociopath, a cornpone Caesar, cut to the very heart of what television did then and does now: repackage reality and personality as a serialized deception, as entertainment.</p>
        <p>At a time when American paranoia over totalitarianism was at its height, and cults of personality were both the cause of and the balm for our fears, what Mr. Schulberg understood so well was not just the mechanical means by which stars are made to burn bright on television, but the flaw in human character that makes such a thing seem possible and desirable and necessary.</p>
        <p>''Network'' (1976), too, reflected the age in which it was made, the mid-70's, the beginning of that era in which the vertically integrated media conglomerate became a ruthless and predatory organism, self-replicating and anti-human. Paddy Chayefsky's oracular script anticipated our current fears about the concentration of information among just a handful of companies accountable to no one, and saw clearly the coming of an age in which all things, even public executions, were permissible on television as long as they generated a number.</p>
        <p>In fact, television has been a staple source of stories for the movies since its infancy. The relationship between film and television has always been a bumptious and fractious thing, at least in part because historically the professional and social hierarchies of those two businesses were as rigidly limited, and limiting, as the court of Louis the Sun King. Film was always the more exclusive club. Television was a consolation prize. (You'll make millions on your series, but no one takes you seriously.) Film -- or cinema, as the literary quarterlies like to call it -- is a director's medium. It is an artist's medium, in fact, at least to hear directors tell it. Television, with its proportionately smaller budgets and five-day shooting schedules, is a performer's medium, according to actors, and almost everyone agrees that there is very little auteur theory at work in a show like ''Nanny and the Professor.''</p>
        <p>In the last 50 years there have been literally hundreds of films that take television to task for its bad taste and its intrusions on our privacy and its slavish devotion to money and the Hollywood community of not-so-well-intentioned boobs responsible for it all. Television for its part portrays the movie business as a playground for self-important, oversexed blowhards in berets and jodhpurs barking instructions through a cardboard megaphone.</p>
        <p>In short, film, being the better-looking and older of the two forms, has something of a superiority complex. Television, though younger, uglier and not very bright, has the weight of its numbers behind it. More people saw that naked fat guy on one episode of ''Survivor'' than have seen all the showings anywhere at any time of ''La Dolce Vita,''  ''The Seven Samurai'' and ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' combined. Such is the sad calculus of popular culture.</p>
        <p>Thus does ''Bamboozled'' find itself part of the long history of film at odds with television. It is specifically critical of the cynicism and institutionalized racism that limits the portrayal of African-Americans on television to those stereotypes with which white television executives are familiar and comfortable -- with what they're used to seeing from the window of the Town Car while they're being driven to work.</p>
        <p>To this end, Mr. Lee takes the kind of chance that only a satirist with a background of mainstream success can afford to take. The idea of a postmodern minstrel show as a runaway network success is so scalding and so far outside the comfort zone of most politically correct conversation that Mr. Lee's point would likely be made even if he had only threatened to make the film or if the film itself weren't any good. And that question I leave to the film critics.</p>
        <p>But does ''Bamboozled'' accurately reflect the dismal condition of racial inequity in television? Certainly. Even viewed casually, the shows that constitute the bulk of primetime programming on upstart networks like UPN and WB tip over into the sort of call-and-response comedy that would have been familiar to steamboat audiences 120 years ago. Are blacks caricatured and stereotyped by television? Certainly. But then so is everyone else -- TV deals in types, not characters -- and the oversimplification of entire races and populations has been television's hallmark for half a century.</p>
        <p>Does ''Bamboozled'' accurately represent the way television gets made? Yes and no. It's a fable, not a how-to, and while the blackface performances are galvanizing to the movie audience, some may notice the absence of any television cameras in the TV studio. The empty spirit of the medium, though, as embodied by the TV executives responsible, is as honest, albeit broad, a representation as you'll see this side of a network pitch meeting.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important: will ''Bamboozled'' change anything? Yes. Maybe. Who knows? Television executives will feel some heat in the newspapers or on the talk shows; they'll make, for a few weeks or months, the right noises about endowing a program to bring more African-Americans into corner office jobs at the networks and the studios. There will be a loud, brief call for proportional hiring practices around the sitcom writing tables in Hollywood, without the usual demurrals about the awkward disincentives of affirmative action. There will be some racket and some heat and some light thrown on things, and maybe 20 years from now they'll write about a movie that carried everybody forward half a step, that alarmed some folks, that got some people thinking differently about some other people and that caused, all in all, quite a stink.</p>
        <p>And isn't that, at the end of the day, the point of satire?</p>
