        <p>Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, looked down the gorgeous hall in the Kremlin of which he was now master. Seated before him, on a muggy summer day, were some 30 men who represented the better part of Russia's capitalist class. They were known as oligarchs, from the Greek-derived ''oligarchy,'' meaning rule of the few. In the Yeltsin era of the 1990's, so much power passed into their hands that the word had fit them like a glove. Putin -- a diminutive man who had made lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B. -- was here to tell them that their rule was over.</p>
        <p>''You built this state yourselves, to a great degree,'' he began, ''through the political or semipolitical structures under your control, so there is no point in blaming the reflection in the mirror.'' The attack was the verbal equivalent of deashibari -- a judo move designed to throw the opponent instantly -- which Putin has said is his favorite gambit. They were, in truth, already off balance. The oligarchic period had made them all very rich. But for most of them, it was an unstable, robber-baron kind of wealth that could be snatched away at any time. Not far from the gilded hall, they knew, Putin was keeping kompromat on them, material gathered by the security agencies on their rise to wealth -- piles that were, a Putin adviser said, ''meters high.''</p>
        <p>But if he has the information and the power of the security services at his back, they have the money. Russian capitalism is a deformed and ugly beast, but the men around the table made it and own it. ''I think Putin understands that he can't just move against business,'' one of the most powerful of them, Mikhail Fridman, had said a few days before the meeting. ''It's too important now.''</p>
        <p>The talk around the table was not heated. There were no surprises. It was the kind of solemn, carefully orchestrated show at which Russia excels. Its outcome, however, will be as weighty for the country as any meeting Putin has convened in his short presidency. For it points up two areas of critical choice. The first is whether Russia's top businessmen can throw off a decade of corruption, strong-arm tactics, internecine feuds and cheating foreigners to emerge as credible financial and industrial leaders. The other, more immediate, questions are whether the independent media, such as they are, can be preserved -- and whether they can develop.</p>
        <p>Since assuming the presidency, Putin has exhibited increasing impatience with dissenting media voices and the magnates who employ them, Vladimir Gusinsky and Boris Berezovsky. In June, Gusinsky was arrested and jailed briefly on charges of embezzlement. The charges were dropped, but not before the heavily indebted Gusinsky signed a deal transferring Media-Most, his conglomerate of newspaper and broadcasting properties, to Gazprom, the government-dominated energy company, for $300 million. Now he is saying he agreed to the transaction in jail, under duress, and the government is threatening new investigations.</p>
        <p>In August, old wounds were rubbed afresh by the treatment Putin received for his handling of the Kursk tragedy. After offering a few consoling words to relatives of the victims, he ripped into the media, who were ''destroying the country and the military'' by evading taxes: ''They want to influence the masses and show the army and the political leadership of the country that we need them, that they had us hooked, that we should be afraid of them, that we should listen to them and let them plunder the country, the army and the fleet. That is their real aim. Unfortunately, we cannot order them to stop, although that would be the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>With Berezovsky, as with Gusinsky, he did the next best thing, which was to try to buy him out. So far, Berezovsky has resisted official arm-twisting to sell his 49 percent stake in the ORT television network, offering instead to give the shares to journalists and intellectuals. ''I will not do anything under pressure,'' he says. ''I am prepared to go to jail if necessary.''</p>
        <p>The two media moguls, who have little popular support, serve a dual purpose for Putin. By attacking them as corrupt, the president intimidates all the other oligarchs, bringing them into line. By destroying Berezovsky and Gusinsky, he could bring the independent media under government control, all under the guise of fighting corruption. Berezovsky and Gusinsky, no fools, know this is the game that is being played, and they are shouting about it to their most receptive audience -- the West.</p>
        <p>Berezovsky, who played a major role in bringing Putin to power, is particularly exercised. ''The first thing Putin did was to consolidate political power,'' he said during a recent swing through the United States to rally political support. ''Next, it will be the media. When he has economic problems, then he will think he has to control oil companies, gas companies.''</p>
        <p>Shrewdly, or perhaps in desperation, Berezovsky has sought to parry Putin's thrusts by turning the issue into a global referendum on the president himself. ''His target is to make Russia into a real, liberal democracy,'' Beresovsky says. ''But he thinks the way to do that is authoritarian. I told him, 'You try to find simple solutions to complex problems.' He doesn't understand the scale of the problems.''</p>
        <p>Berezovsky, a ruthless businessman who was not above using his ORT network for political ends in the 1996 presidential campaign, makes an awkward messenger for democracy and freedom. But the lines have been drawn. ''Maybe I'm stupid to fight him,'' Berezovsky says, adding that it is not just democracy that's at issue. ''If he continues this way, he'll also destroy business in Russia.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps, but his erstwhile colleagues in the business elite are betting exactly the opposite. If they behave themselves, they believe -- pay their taxes, stop meddling in politics and forswear sweetheart deals from unscrupulous politicians -- then Putin will spare them the fate of their media-owning brethren. This would allow them to consolidate their gains and emerge as pillars of a new and respectable business community. That is their hope, at any rate.</p>
        <p>Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven built and run the Alfa Group of companies. During our talk in his high-ceilinged office, Fridman directed me to a recent newspaper interview with the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov -- once known as Misha 2 Percent for his alleged habit of demanding a commission on deals he sanctioned when he was finance minister. Kasyanov said that Yeltsin had allowed business to do much as it liked, but that those days were over. Fridman agreed with him: ''Business was young in Yeltsin's days, and I think it was right that it wasn't prosecuted. It was completely informal, this protection from the law. It was never written down, but we all understood it.''</p>
        <p>This protection was both from the law, an uncertain commodity still in Russia, and from the new political classes who hated both the oligarchs and Yeltsin. Their weapon -- as Putin's is now -- was often kompromat. I saw one of these dossiers last year in Moscow. It purported to be the product of the Duma's security committee under the chairmanship of the Communist deputy, Viktor Ilyukhin. ''Mikhail Fridman,'' it read, ''born in 1964 in the city of Lvov, former Ukrainian Republic, a Jew. Pyotr Aven, born 1955 in Moscow, a Jew.''</p>
        <p>It said that Fridman had used criminals to further his business activities, that Aven had dealt in drugs, that Fridman corrupted senior police officials in Kazhakstan and that Aven was fired from his job as trade minister after an intelligence agency investigation showed ''embezzlement, damage to the economic interests of the country and criminal ties with the secret service of Israel.'' The allegation of drug running also turned up in a report published in August by the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity. The accusation -- that the Alfa Group's leaders had organized drug shipments from Central Asia to Europe -- was based on a United States intelligence source, based in turn on an interview with an unnamed former K.G.B. agent. When I asked Fridman about it, he shrugged and said, ''That stuff's always around.''</p>
        <p>In the course of the interview, which took place about a week before the showdown with Putin, Fridman's cell phone rang. He spoke softly at first, but then became forceful and louder. ''Tell him we must have it soon,'' he told the caller. ''We're ready for it now.'' He clicked off the phone. ''That was Nemtsov.'' Boris Nemtsov, a former prime minister, is now the leader of the Union of Right Forces, an economically liberal party that receives major financial support from Fridman and Aven. That evening, the TV news would show Nemtsov saying that Putin had agreed to meet and that this should put an end to the attacks on the ''oligarchs.''</p>
        <p>Fridman continued: ''I think the best plan would be if Putin were to declare an amnesty on everything that happened in the past. There were breaches of the law, but to open all that up again, to undo privatizations three or four years after they happened, it's crazy.''</p>
        <p>Aven, speaking in his office down the hall, surrounded by his extraordinary collection of Russian 19th-century paintings, offered a scathing assessment of the Yeltsin period: ''Those who were closest to Yeltsin behaved as if they were running the government. Put yourself in Putin's shoes. You can't have that kind of relationship!''</p>
        <p>Yet state power and private business have been intertwined for more than a decade. The oligarchs quickly learned that they could not guarantee their wealth and power without a network of contacts and clients in the sprawling and ever-growing presidential and government bureaucracy. In the late 1980's, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who built up the Menatep group of companies and the oil company Yukos, traded a career in the Komsomol, the Communist youth organization, for a risky future in the emerging private sector. He took care at each stage to attract the support of the state and benefited from that closeness by winning a string of lucrative state contracts. Vladimir Potanin, chairman of a large conglomerate, Interros, followed his father, a senior trade official, into the foreign trade ministry. His connections there enabled him to land government accounts for his new bank, Oneximbank.</p>
        <p>Fridman, a Ukrainian Jew and very much an outsider, saw his Alfa Group take off when he recruited Aven, the first trade minister of the new Russian government. And the new kid on the block, Roman Abramovich, now probably the most powerful, wealthy and certainly the most discreet of the oligarchs, grew strong under the tutelage of Berezovsky within the Kremlin ''family.''</p>
        <p>The apogee of oligarchic influence was reached in 1996, with their collective decision to underwrite Yeltsin's re-election campaign in return for huge slices of state property at extraordinarily low prices -- the so-called ''loans for shares'' deal. It made many of them, already rich, superrich. It made oil barons of Khodorkovsky, Berezovsky, Potanin, Abramovich and, later, Aven and Fridman.</p>
        <p>But the party ended in August 1998, when the ruble collapsed, the economy nose-dived and living standards fell by 20 percent. After that, they could never sail their yachts into Nice harbor with a shipload of models -- as Potanin was known to do -- with the same insouciance. Russia was -- is -- near collapse; many Russians are close to hunger. For now, and for some time to come, discretion will be the watchword.</p>
        <p>Putin came to power through Yeltsin and his ''family,'' including the court oligarchs. But though he ran with the system, he is increasingly defying it. Instead, he is building his Kremlin power base around the National Security Council. He has put an old K.G.B. friend from St. Petersburg, Sergei Ivanov, at its head: no large decisions are taken without his consultation. The most important of his three immediate deputies is Oleg Chernov, a man wholly hidden from the public gaze but credited with formidable intelligence. He is now seen as the oligarchs' nemesis.</p>
        <p>Chernov has been entrusted with some of the most delicate work of the new presidency. He has been making contact with American business leaders, trying to rekindle an interest in Russia that was demolished in the ruble collapse. Top level sessions between selected business executives and Putin are scheduled for next month.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Chernov has worked on those meters-high towers of files -- especially on the cash flows of the oligarchs and where their money is stashed. He has made contact with the Swiss procurator general's office, which is plowing through a huge investigation into Russian companies registered in the country -- in particular those controlled or created by Berezovsky. The National Security Council, whose top leadership is composed almost entirely of former K.G.B. officials, is the sword of Damocles above the oligarchs' heads, its files the guarantee of their continued good behavior.</p>
        <p>The most plugged-in of the oligarchs had known for some time what the atmosphere was in the Kremlin and had resolved to make a deal to avoid a conflict they might lose. Vladimir Potanin, sitting on the edge of a chair in his grand office, had been better plugged in than anyone. Yet I was surprised by how shaken he seemed, how earnestly he wished for peace. He, like many of the oligarchs, had been threatened. He had received what he described as a ''racketeering letter, a discredit to the state,'' from the Russian procurator general, accusing him of paying $140 million less than fair value for one of the jewels of his empire, Norilsk Nickel, among the world's biggest nickel producers and the largest producer of palladium.</p>
        <p>''Earlier this year,'' he told me, ''I convened a meeting of a number of my colleagues and said to them, 'We must admit we're not popular!' Someone suggested hiring an image consultancy. I said that we have to go further than that. Ordinary people who can't afford to go to visit their families in Russia see us going to St.-Tropez and calling it a business trip. We have to make sure we pay all of our personal taxes. We should be irreproachable personally.'' I asked what the outcome was. ''We didn't agree.''</p>
        <p>But he was eager to show that he knew the game was up. ''We're like clay at the moment,'' he said. ''We've been made soft by the attacks, and now we're waiting to be molded, though, of course, we won't stay like this forever. We know, most of us, that we can't fight the central power.''</p>
        <p>Thus, they sued for peace, and it seems they have got it. By the end of the Kremlin meeting, Putin had committed himself to the amnesty that Fridman and Potanin had called for. ''The president reiterated his position, that authorities would not review the outcome of privatizations,'' read a news release from Putin's office. ''But it is unacceptable for competing companies to use state institutions and law enforcement agencies to achieve their goals.''</p>
        <p>But Putin has not entirely ruled out further investigating the privatizations. ''I believe it will depend on whether or not his reforms cause a strong business revival,'' says Aleksandr Tsipko, the chief political analyst at the Gorbachev Fund in Moscow. ''If they do not, I think he will take the natural resources back into state ownership, leaving the industry in private hands.''</p>
        <p>Under this kind of pressure, the banking and energy oligarchs have been scrambling to show loyalty. Potanin told me that ''we were very much children of our times. That is how it was then. Now, we have to change. Those who cannot will have themselves to blame for anything that happens.''</p>
        <p>One thing they cannot change is their ethnic identity. In a country where Jewishness is best kept quiet, nearly all of the oligarchs are Jewish. Most of them keep a low profile. ''People already hate us because we're in business,'' Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the sardonic head of Yukos oil, told the writer Chrystia Freeland. ''Why give them something else?''</p>
        <p>To their dismay, Gusinsky has. A very public supporter of Israel and the president of the Russian branch of the World Jewish Congress, Gusinsky hasn't hesitated to blame anti-Semitism in the Kremlin for his business problems. ''He should not have done that,'' Aven says. ''Fridman gives half a million dollars a year to Jewish charities -- of his own money! But quietly. There are Jews in the Kremlin, appointed under Putin. There is anti-Semitism lower down, in the middle ranks of the security services and the government, but that has always been so.''</p>
        <p>Since the meeting, the Kremlin has sought to capitalize on the new malleability of the oligarchs. Chernov has expressed surprise at the details they have confided. These include revelations about the finances of Prime Minister Kasyanov, who had formerly been a client of Berezovsky's and Abramovich's, and about those of the former prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, said to be one of the richest men in Russia.</p>
        <p>And business is changing, eroding the world in which the oligarchs lived for much of the 90's. Outside directors, including Western fund managers, are forcing themselves on the boards of the privatized companies. While the threat of prosecution is mostly in abeyance, the oligarchs are still being pushed hard to pay taxes -- pressure backed by figures that show, for example, that Abramovich's Sibneft paid one-third of what other oil companies paid in taxes. The push on taxes is underpinned by a new code described by Putin as ''the most important event in the country's life.'' The vast gas and electricity monopolies -- Gazprom and RAO-UES -- are now being hounded by the state. Putin pushed Chernomyrdin out of the chairmanship of Gazprom and will appoint a new chief executive soon; the company's tax payments are being investigated, as are those of RAO-UES.</p>
        <p>If the story ended here it would be an anticlimax -- Putin told the oligarchs to shape up and they did. But it is complicated by the issue of press freedom, and we are sure to hear more from the two oligarchs who remain unreconciled -- Berezovsky and Gusinsky. Though many of the oligarchs have some media properties, only these two control big television channels as well as newspapers, magazines and publishing houses. If the Kremlin squashes them, as both have been at pains to point out, it also squashes the independent media.</p>
        <p>Boris Berezovsky was the iconic figure of the oligarchic age. No one was closer to Yeltsin's ''family'' -- the little group composed of the former president's younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and his closest aides and drinking and bathing buddies. He had links with the leaders of the Chechen revolt and manipulated them for political and personal gain. He reshaped Russia's media. He survived two assassination attempts. When for some months he was deputy secretary of the National Security Council, he used his position to jet about the old Soviet Union and negotiate with the presidents and ministers of the former republics.</p>
        <p>Yet he usually disposed of shares in his companies -- exercising only ''influence.'' Like T.S. Eliot's mystery cat, Macavity, he was at once ubiquitous and not (quite) there. Now he claims to have virtually nothing. ''I was at the Israeli Embassy,'' he said, ''and had to fill in a form in which it asked my profession. I thought of putting 'Unemployed.''' Indeed, in an interview, Berezovsky looks a changed man. Gone is his hawkish, aggressive manner. His hair has thinned noticeably, and he seems older and more humble, perhaps a bit too self-consciously.</p>
        <p>George Soros, the American financier, tried and failed to do business with Berezovsky in the late 90's, when the Russian was at the height of his power. Berezovsky, Soros wrote in The New York Review of Books, ''could not make the transition to legitimacy; his only chance of survival was to keep people entangled in the web of illegitimate relations that he had established.'' He has failed in this, but not for want of trying. He got to know Putin and supported his bid for the presidency. He assisted Yeltsin's closest aides -- his chief of staff, Aleksandr Voloshin, and his former chief, Valentin Yumashev -- in creating Unity, a pro-Putin group that came from nothing to be the second biggest party in the Duma.</p>
        <p>But now Berezovsky is out in the cold, having renounced his seat in the Duma and the immunity from prosecution that it brings. While he has said goodbye to the Duma, however, he has not left politics. His new manifestation is as an oppositionist-democrat -- freedom fighter, almost. He explained the switch in his customary swift, nervy and elegant manner:</p>
        <p>''Nowadays, the president and his circle just don't understand what I'm proposing and don't understand the consequences of what they're doing. So while I don't rule out any further opportunities to convince the powers that be, I think that persuasion has to move to another level -- that is, of forming a constructive opposition to the presidential authority. The one way to have a dialogue with power in Russia is to have power yourself.'' With almost 49 percent of the ORT channel and as the one who pays the bills and salaries, his power to counter power remains immense.</p>
        <p>The challenge posed by Vladimir Gusinsky is, in some ways, even sharper. For Gusinsky was never part of Putin's inner circle. Rather, he is an oppositionist, as he was to Yeltsin in the latter period of his presidency. He is a familiar figure in the West: a wealthy press baron who takes on an administration he dislikes. But such a figure has never existed in Russia. It is an open question whether it can now.</p>
        <p>Gusinsky has already been exiled once -- by Yeltsin. Putin's security services went one further, imprisoning him for four days in June. Released, he was confined to Moscow, but released again in July after Putin's tte--tte with President Clinton at the economic summit meeting in Okinawa. As soon as the order was lifted, Gusinsky took his private jet to Spain, where he remains today in his villa.</p>
        <p>Gusinsky is not a good man among rogues. A former -- and unsuccessful -- theater director, he is volatile of temper, has a long memory for a grudge and employs a small army of ex-K.G.B. men who are notoriously tough in the service of their master. Leonid Skoptsov, main aide to Kakha Bendukidze, told me that his boss had met Gusinsky one day in the corridors of the Russian Duma, shortly after he had bought the Uralmash plant. Gusinsky asked how much he paid for it, and Bendukidze named a sum of around $1 million. ''That's nothing!'' Gusinsky said, laughing, ''I paid that for the deputy minister of finance. And it will be a better investment!''</p>
        <p>Gusinsky was the only one of the major business figures to back a rival to Putin -- Yuri Luzhkov- right up to and through the elections in March. When Gusinsky met him in the late 1980's, Luzhkov was a middling-to-senior Moscow bureaucrat. His appetite for work, his ambition and his control of the city's housing stock propelled him to become, in 1992, a hugely powerful and popular mayor -- so powerful and popular that, by 1998, he thought himself ready to stand for the presidency of Russia, with the support of Gusinsky's media.</p>
        <p>Until late 1999, it seemed as if he had little competition -- certainly not from the buttoned-up, former K.G.B. officer whom the Kremlin, incredibly, had made prime minister and seemed to think would succeed Yeltsin. Putin's triumph -- which owed much to an onslaught on Luzhkov from Berezovsky's ORT channel -- has left the Moscow mayor fearful and uncharacteristically humble. And not without reason: in August, the interior ministry announced an investigation into allegations of corruption on the part of 30 city hall officials, two of them senior.</p>
        <p>But Gusinsky did not follow Luzhkov's example. His media kept up -- even stepped up -- their critical coverage of Putin and of the war in Chechnya that Putin had, as prime minister, unleashed and continues as president. Gusinsky has attracted some of the most independent-minded and talented journalists in Russia, people who say they are there because they believe in a free press and will fight for it. These include Yevgeny Kiselyev of NTV and Mikhail Berger, who edits Media-Most's main daily newspaper, Sevodnya (Today).</p>
        <p>I went to see Berger in the paper's down-at-the-heels quarters just off Leningrad Avenue. ''Gusinsky doesn't direct us what to write,'' he said, as his senior colleagues milled outside his sparse office waiting for the morning editorial meeting. ''All of the editors in the group have the same mentality. We're liberals; we believe in a liberal society. That's what annoys the Kremlin.''</p>
        <p>He told me of a meeting between several chief editors of daily newspapers and Putin earlier in the year, in the Kremlin: ''I asked him why he never consented to be interviewed for Sevodnya or on NTV. He said: 'I talk to journalists who have the same opinions as I do. When the journalists there share my point of view, then I'll give you an interview.'''</p>
        <p>The impression I gained from Berger, of one determined to carry on pulling on the bear's tail, was deepened by talking to Igor Shenderovich. He is the main creative mind behind ''Kukly'' (''Puppets''), a weekly show on NTV that satirizes politicians and other public figures. Shenderovich calmly and humorously talked of Putin as one who ''obviously has an inferiority complex. In that he is very different from Yeltsin. Yeltsin, for all his obvious failings, felt himself to be a president. Putin does not.''</p>
        <p>The previous episode of ''Kukly'' had shown Putin as Girolamo Savonarola, the monk who held Florence in a puritanical grip for a few years at the end of the 15th century. Eventually, he was deposed and hanged by the faction that could no longer bear his apocalyptic tirades against corruption. It was, no doubt, unfair, as was Berger's depiction of a thin-skinned politician overreacting to liberal criticism. But that goes with the turf of a democratic leader. Gusinsky's stable of journalists are issuing an implicit challenge to Putin: Can you take it? Are you a democratic leader?</p>
        <p>If he answers in the affirmative, it will be in conflict with at least some part of his nature. I went to see Yevgeny Kiselyev, the general director of NTV, in his office in the Ostankino TV center, a little before a fire badly damaged its broadcasting tower. He told me that a high Kremlin official had called on him at the end of last year with a list of ''desires.'' He had noted them down on a piece of paper, which he produced and read. At the top of the list was the desire that ''Kukly'' drop the puppet of Vladimir Putin, then still the prime minister.</p>
        <p>Kiselyev and his team decided they would give their visitor what he wanted. In the next episode, there was no prime minister. Instead Aleksandr Voloshin, the highest official in the Kremlin, was shown as Moses, bringing down tablets to the Israelites from a supreme being whose existence was shrouded in clouds above Mount Sinai.</p>
        <p>But Moses-Voloshin and the Israelites have a problem. They don't know how to address the supreme being. In the end, they settle on the title ''Lord God,'' or in Russian, ''Gospod Bog,'' and then decide to shorten it to the initials G.B. As every adult viewer in Russia recognized, G.B. is a shortening for ''gosudarstvennaya bezopasnost,'' or state security. The supreme being was the highest state security functionary of them all, the former K.G.B. colonel, Vladimir Putin.</p>
        <p>Far more serious, for Putin and Russia, was the sinking of the Kursk attack submarine in August. The media were sharply critical of the naval authorities for lying about the date of the submarine's disappearance and the date of the request for foreign assistance, for their refusal to release the names of the crew and for the shabby treatment of the relatives of the victims. But they reserved their harshest words for the failure of Vladimir Putin, then on holiday in the Black Sea, to fly to the headquarters of the Northern Fleet to meet in timely fashion with the anxious relatives.</p>
        <p>The oligarch-owned channels did suffer discrimination in reporting the story. Only the state-controlled channel, RTR, was allowed to cover the belated meeting, in the closed port of Vidyayevo, between the president and the relatives. In an interview with The Moscow News, a correspondent for the German television channel RTL claimed that RTR's chief, Oleg Dobrodeyev -- who was using RTL's satellite transmission facilities because RTR had none of their own on the spot -- screened out the more bitter moments and looked for shots ''where the atmosphere was more or less calm.'' It is an allegation that Arkady Mamontov, the RTR correspondent, angrily denies. ''Everything that was said into the camera was instantly transmitted,'' he says. ''I never got orders not to ask tricky questions.''</p>
        <p>Putin's priorities are, first, to save the state from disintegration; second, to get some economic growth; and third, to draw the countries that were republics of the former Soviet Union closer to it. His economy, artificially buoyed by high oil prices, remains stubbornly unreformed; his army remains stuck in a murderous guerrilla war in Chechnya; and Russia is falling behind daily in the global struggle for economic advantage and modernization. As he wrestles with these problems, the questions of how to deepen democracy or to assure freedom for his tormentors take second place. Indeed, his thoughts are more likely to be, How do we get control of their media or, failing that, transfer control to people more likely to like us?</p>
        <p>The Russia Putin has inherited has not yet made the transition from authoritarianism to solid democratic habit. Boris Yeltsin was too careless of institutions, too absent from the construction of the new state, to bequeath more than an anarchic market grafted on top of a decaying command economy. Putin can still return to autocracy, whip his business class into line, muzzle the media. The new political season now starting in Moscow should answer a looming question: Is the new leader of Russia capable of recognizing that some scourges are essential to democratic practice and must be tolerated? The signs are not all that encouraging.</p>
        <p>''Putin thinks the Russian people are not prepared for democracy,'' says one insider, who refused to be identified. ''He says, 'We need to push them toward democracy, using power.'</p>
        <p>''I asked him, 'Don't you think this is a contradiction?'</p>
        <p>''I don't think so,' he said.''</p>
