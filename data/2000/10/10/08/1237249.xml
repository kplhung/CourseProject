        <p>Fuzzy math?</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas started strong at a rollicking town hall meeting this morning where the crowd at a community college gym was pounding the bleachers as if at a basketball game.</p>
        <p>Tieless, in a blue shirt, and roaming the floor with a handheld microphone, Mr. Bush accused his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, of favoring ''Gore-gantuan government.'' He thundered that Mr. Gore ''likes Hillary-Care. He wants to nationalize the health care system of America.'' But Mr. Bush then perplexingly added, speaking of Mr. Gore, ''He wants the doctors making every decision on behalf of every patient in the country.'' (He usually says bureaucrats, not doctors.)</p>
        <p>Undaunted, Mr. Bush, campaigning in this west-central Florida city near Tampa, held a baby. He greeted a 102-year-old. And he did not miss a beat when a man yelled from the crowd and pre-empted his usual riff about the need for strong military. ''He took my punch line,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We need a speechwriter.''</p>
        <p>Soon, he did seem in need of a speechwriter as he tried to explain how the tax code works and why a single mother earning $22,000 and raising two children can end up paying taxes at a higher marginal rate than someone earning $200,000.</p>
        <p>It came out as a meaningless array of numbers and addition. ''She starts to lose her earned income tax credit,'' Mr. Bush said. ''For the first time she's in the 15 percent bracket. When you add another 15 percent, or 16.2 percent, payroll tax on top of that, plus the 2.9, I mean the payroll tax and the Medicare tax, 16.4 percent, you end up with a high marginal rate. And that's not right, and that's not fair. And we're going to do something about it. We're going to drop the rate and lower the . . .''</p>
        <p>Instead of finishing his sentence he made a guttural noise, and quietly consulted his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, who was sitting nearby and smiling.</p>
        <p>Then trying again, Mr. Bush began spitting out numbers like a computer gone haywire, saying, ''15.3 percent, 12.4 and 2.9.'' (Only the real cognoscenti would know that he had just corrected his addition, putting together the 12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax and the 2.9 percent Medicare tax to get 15.3 percent.)</p>
        <p>''I was trying to do some fuzzy math,'' Mr. Bush said, using the phrase he had repeated often during Tuesday's debate as a way of rebutting Mr. Gore's charges that Mr. Bush's tax cut disproportionately favors the wealthy. ''Yeah, I used his calculator. Then I used the real one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did better a little later when a man in the audience proposed eliminating hundred dollar bills as a way to make it more difficult for drug dealers to stash their cash.</p>
        <p>''Well I really hadn't thought about it,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's an interesting idea.'' A few seconds later he added, ''What I'm trying to do is get some more people to have $100 bills.''</p>
        <p>Some politicians might get defensive about such tangles. Mr. Bush laughs at himself. At another town hall meeting, earlier this week, he brought up his propensity for scrambling words. ''Sometimes, you know, I might mangle a syl-LA-ble occasionally. Get it?'' he said breezily, deliberately putting the emphasis in the wrong place.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush unexpectedly held a news conference on an airport tarmac in Florida on Friday night, it was his first one since mid-September, when he was pummeled with questions about a Republican commercial attacking Mr. Gore's health care proposals in which the word ''rats'' flashes on the screen.</p>
        <p>Never mind that Republicans had been sending out regular e-mail messages counting how many days the reporters on Mr. Gore's campaign plane had been held ''hostage'' without a news conference. (He held his first one in 67 days on Sept. 22.) To keep from stepping on his campaign message of the day, Mr. Bush adopted the same technique.</p>
        <p>Efforts to question him failed. When Mr. Bush appeared the day after the presidential debate with a police group to receive its endorsement, he waved off questions, saying ''I got questioned out last night.''</p>
        <p>It might have all worked fine except that the governor is sociable and actually seems to like bantering with the reporters at the back of his campaign plane. But with no news conferences, reporters rebelled and refused to allow him to speak to them off the record and off camera.</p>
        <p>Each day this week, aides to Mr. Bush have come back to the press section of the plane like a scouting party to see if the governor could come back for some unrecorded chatter. Each day reporters said no. Sometimes Mr. Bush took to standing in the alcove between the staff section of the plane and the press section, only to be rebuffed.</p>
        <p>So he had a news conference. And as soon as it was over he asked one of the first reporters he saw whether he could now resume his schmooze sessions at the back of the plane.</p>
