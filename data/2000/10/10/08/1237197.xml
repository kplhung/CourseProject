      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Bushies kept telling me that, eventually, I would feel the Cheney magic. They said it would tingle ''like champagne,'' as one member of the clan put it.</p>
        <p>In the debate on Thursday night, Big Time finally got to me -- big time. I was swept up in a vanilla gust of Cheney chic.</p>
        <p>Let Al Gore sigh and roll his eyes and do his smarmy Eddie Haskell. (''With all due respect, Mrs. Cleaver, for a mom you're quite a babe.'') Let W. snort and sniffle and get that look of thinly veiled terror when he hears a three-syllable name with too many consonants in it. Let Holy Joe gush about his personal odyssey of ethnic acceptance. Bring me the bald, pasty head of Big Time.</p>
        <p>In a race where every gesture is contrived, every event is stage managed, and all the phrases, comebacks and footwear are focus-grouped, Big Time never stoops to conquer.</p>
        <p>It was 50 minutes into the vice-presidential debate before the Republican even bothered to look at the camera and address the viewers at home, rather than Bernard Shaw.</p>
        <p>It's curiously refreshing to see a candidate act so aloof, and even vaguely put out, as though the campaign were taking precious time away from his golden-years fishing.</p>
        <p>The other guys are always cuddling, kissing, misting, sharing family stories and trying to Feel Deeply all the injustices of the world.</p>
        <p>Big Time is an unrepentant old-school guy, an insider's insider who blanches at glad-handing and gauzy handling. He does Feel Deeply, but he Feels Deeply that it was wrong for the press to hound him into giving up his stock options. He Feels Deeply, as he showed when he tried to restrict the press during Desert Storm, that he much prefers the Second Amendment to the First.</p>
        <p>He may be politically atavistic and autistic, but at least he's authentic.</p>
        <p>It's bracing to see a candidate who doesn't even bother to pretend that he's having a good time reading to schoolchildren or letting babies drool on him or hearing sob stories from the downtrodden. He is here as a Bush family retainer, after all. He prefers to pander up.</p>
        <p>He is a Republican who got rich buoyed by government connections and contracts, even though he protested in the debate that ''the government had absolutely nothing to do'' his success. He shares with W. the rugged pretense that he is an utterly self-made man.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Shaw told the two running mates that they should pretend to be black for a question on racial profiling, Holy Joe was happy to get jiggy with it. Big Time, however, had the honesty to look at Mr. Shaw as though he were whack.</p>
        <p>''Well, Bernie,'' he began, ''I, I'd like to answer your question to the best of my ability but I -- I don't think I can understand fully what it would be like.''</p>
        <p>In the debate, it became clear that Mr. Cheney is not so much running for vice president as Chief of Staff, or Chaperone. He will be the smart disciplinarian who, with that phlegmatic baritone monotone, will tether the squirmy, squeaky W. He will keep an eye on the nuclear codes while Junior sits in the Oval, playing video golf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney provided the heft for the intellectually unburdened Gerald Ford. He can do it again for W.</p>
        <p>He is preternaturally placid. The excitable Bushes, who hate being upstaged and who hate disloyalty, find that reassuring.</p>
        <p>But they sell Big Time short. In the debate, he was so smooth that he inadvertently made W. look as if he were still in political diapers.</p>
        <p>In Washington, you always have to be very suspicious of anyone who is not fairly panting with ambition, anyone who seems self-effacing.</p>
        <p>If Dick Cheney were in a Tom Clancy-style thriller, he'd be the White House official who blends into the woodwork in the first act, only to quietly usurp the president in the second -- the bespectacled puppetmaster who blackmails uncooperative congressmen, fakes authorizations for C.I.A. covert operations and makes deals with cartels.</p>
        <p>Think Gene Hackman as a conniving Cheney turning on Keanu Reeves as a hapless President W. (And, of course, Angela Lansbury, circa ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' as Lynne.)</p>
        <p>What if Big Time's thin lips hide a crocodile's grin?</p>
        <p>Be afraid, Bushes. Be very afraid.</p>
