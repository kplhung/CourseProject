        <p>Clair Watson, Creative Consultant  Photograph by Gillian Laub</p>
        <p>Clair Watson's two passions have always been art and fashion, but who knew she'd find the best of both in other people's castoffs? Eight years ago, she was ''restructured'' out of a job at Benetton. So the Indian-born, English-raised Watson -- a thrift-store addict who favors a mod 1960's look -- answered an ad in The New York Times for a merchandiser position at the Irvington Institute Thrift Shop. The first window display she mounted -- which had a stars-and-stripes theme for the Fourth of July -- caused fireworks. From there, Watson, now 46, was recruited to give the City Opera Thrift Shop a much-needed makeover. ''The idea of 'thrift' and 'opera' in the same name appealed to me,'' she says. Working with style-world figures like Lorry Newhouse, Hamish Bowles and Amy Fine Collins, Watson organized opera-themed benefit events -- like ''Vixen,'' from Janacek's opera ''The Cunning Little Vixen'' -- that catapulted the shop into gossip columns and fashion magazines. Next month, Watson's ''Three Oranges'' event, named for the Prokofiev opera ''The Love for Three Oranges,'' will feature a furniture-and-collectibles sale. Now, she's modernizing the gift shop for the City Opera and developing an ''anti-icon'' logo, which, she promises, ''will not be dreary.''</p>

        <p>Charles D. Scheips Jr., Director, Conde Nast Archive  Photograph by Christian Witkin</p>
        <p>In our postmodern age, the 20th century is one big style mine: keep flipping through images, and you'll strike gold. Decorators, fashion designers and magazine editors alike pore over pictures of houses and celebrities as if they are the Dead Sea Scrolls; you never know when that photograph of Babe Paley</p>
        <p>or of Sister Parish's living room might inspire the Next Big Thing. And in the lifestyle-publishing world, the mother lode of style images is the Conde Nast Archive. Steichen, de Meyer, Beaton, Horst, Penn -- you name it, it's in there, represented by one iconic image after another in magazines like Vogue, House &amp; Garden and Vanity Fair. The archive had become a bit of a buried treasure -- until Charlie Scheips showed up as a freelancer in 1993 and began holding the gems up to the light. Now the archive's director, Scheips, 41, sees it as ''a content provider for both our own magazines and the outside world.'' He adds, ''We've covered the who's who of the 20th century.'' The archive is lending photographs to major exhibitions of the work of Steichen, Horst and John Rawlings, among others, and Scheips is also building a database. The archive will eventually encompass virtually every photograph and illustration in the company's holdings -- a number he estimates at between one million and two million. Scheips relishes his custodial role. ''To bring the past to a new generation is very exciting,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Mayer Rus, Editor, Interior Design  Photograph by Rishad Mistri</p>
        <p>Interior Design magazine is the bible of the commercial-design industry, but Mayer Rus is not your typical trade-magazine editor. Rus, 33, favors Phat Farm and Nike over suits and ties. He once showed up at the magazine's black-tie hall-of-fame awards with a tattoo on his (shaved) head. And everybody who knows him knows his dog, Louise. Rus, who majored in art history at Yale University, never planned on going into publishing; he just fell into it and ''learned on the job, like Madonna.'' But he learned fast, landing the top spot at the age of 28, even though the folks at the magazine's parent company, Cahners, had never seen anything like him before. ''My cubicle was decked out in Ivana Trump covers from The Post,'' he explains. Now, Interior Design devotes as much space to art, fashion and popular culture as it does to law offices and department stores. And then there is its notorious back-page column, Intervention, in which Rus -- under the nom de plume of Addison DeWitt, the viper-tongued theater critic in ''All About Eve'' -- skewers the industry's sacred cows. ''I object to the notion that a trade magazine has to be less sexy than a consumer magazine,'' he argues. ''A little bit of naughtiness has served me well.''</p>
        <p>Miranda Brooks Landscape Designer  Photograph by Jeff Riedel</p>
        <p>Restlessness is a virtue for Miranda Brooks. The 32-year-old British native, who arrived in New York seven years ago, knows that gardens, even when completed, are never done. ''They keep changing,'' Brooks explains. ''I never stop working on them, and I'm never satisfied.'' This vigilance keeps Brooks on the go, from London to Turkey to the Caribbean, working on houses with architects like Annabelle Selldorf and David Chipperfield, for clients like the model Stella Tennant; Vogue's editor, Anna Wintour (Brooks is a Vogue contributing editor); and assorted Rothschilds. Brooks's first commercial project, at the Shore Club, Philip Pilevsky's forthcoming Miami Beach hotel, allowed her to use giant versions of her signature water tanks and to comb local nurseries for the ''most organic-looking'' trees. (Brooks complains that Americans like their trees ''too pruned and perfect, like lollipops.'') Her Top 10 list includes Humphry Repton, the 18th-century landscape architect, and Moorish and Indian gardens. But there are greener pastures to conquer. ''I'm longing to go to Japan,'' Brooks says. ''That's my next quest. Time for a change.''</p>
        <p>Steven Sclaroff, Interior Designer  Photograph by Deborah Jaffe</p>
        <p>Steven Sclaroff has always had a knack for mixing the old with the new. By the age of 12, he was working in an antiques shop, and at 16 he was selling modern and Arts and Crafts furniture to dealers at flea markets. After studying architecture at Carnegie Mellon and falling in love with both Pittsburgh's industrial buildings and its glut of castoff Gilded Age antiques, Sclaroff settled in New York, where his first, unglamorous-but-useful job was designing chain drug and shoe stores. In 1994, he joined Aero Studios, the downtown-chic firm whose clients have ranged from Giorgio Armani to the bathroom-fixtures company Waterworks. Last year, Sclaroff, 35, set up shop on his own, designing a video-editing studio filled with midcentury European furniture, the accessories moguls Kate and Andy Spade's weekend house in Southampton, N.Y., and their Jack Spade store in SoHo. Sclaroff now sells his own line of wood-and-glass lamps and has designed a series of doorknobs in bronze and brass for Nanz Custom Hardware. ''I don't really like all the plastic stuff,'' he says. ''I'm into classic, durable materials. They impart more of a quality experience to whatever you're using.''</p>
        <p>Alexa Hampton, Interior Designer  Photograph by Fredric Reshew</p>
        <p>When, at the tender age of 27, Alexa Hampton suddenly found herself the head of the decorating firm founded by her father, the legendary Mark Hampton, who died in 1998 at 58, the big question seemed to be, can she do it? Two years later, Hampton may still be a bit awed by her title -- ''C.E.O. seems kind of funny for a decorating firm,'' she muses -- but the answer is an unequivocal yes. The designer, with her mane of honey-blond hair, husky voice and no-nonsense manner, is maintaining the firm's traditional approach, but in her own young, unfussy style. ''We have a bunch of big houses, mostly in the east, a house abroad, we've done a couple of planes, and we're working on a ship,'' she says, ticking off her list. For anyone we know? ''Nobody wants people knowing how they spend their money these days,'' she says. Then there are the new pieces she's designing for Hickory Chair's Mark Hampton Collection and furniture and fabrics under her own name for Kravet. Hampton, whose passions include Florentine architecture and naval history, doesn't have a signature style. ''My father taught me that you had to learn all the styles, become familiar with the language of design. After that, mixing is so much easier.''</p>
