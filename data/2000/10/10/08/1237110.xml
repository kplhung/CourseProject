        <p>A battle in the long war between humans and pigeons is being waged in a small corner of Bensonhurst. So far, it seems the pigeons are winning.</p>
        <p>Scores of the birds have chosen a tower at the Bay 50th Street elevated subway station as a favorite roosting site. Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the tower, say they have taken great pains to rid the area of pigeons. But people who live near the tower say nothing effective has been done. The proof was on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>''We have to park our car down the street, or else it would be covered in it,'' said Angelo Santamarco, whose apartment is situated at Stillwell Avenue near Avenue X, referring to the droppings that covered the sidewalk, porch and even handrails in front of his house. ''And when you leave, you really got to make a run for it. Or you'll be covered, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Santamarco said the problem had gotten much worse in recent years, and was especially acute at night, when pigeons, and blackbirds too, spend time cooing and dropping.</p>
        <p>Last March, Mr. Santamarco's mother, Vincenza Rotante, who also lives in his building, called the Bensonhurst West End Community Council and asked for help. The council's president, Carmine Santa Maria, then wrote to the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden.</p>
        <p>In his letter, Mr. Santa Maria said complaints about droppings were common near the elevated train.</p>
        <p>''I know Brooklyn is a great place to live in, but unfortunately so do the pigeons,'' he wrote. ''Can't we encourage them to move elsewhere, like Manhattan?''</p>
        <p>Well, not really. Mr. Golden wrote to the M.T.A., which hired a company to trap the pigeons and release them at least 50 miles away to prevent homing, said Melissa Farley, an M.T.A. spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Santamarco said he had not seen anyone setting traps. A visitor on Friday saw several pigeons landing on the structure's crossbeams, which were covered in a filthy gray. Evidence of several failed efforts at pigeon control was everywhere: hundreds of spikes; old, torn netting covered with feces and feathers, a sound box, even a wooden owl meant to scare pigeons. ''None of it works,'' said Mr. Santamarco, adding that M.T.A. workers used to hose down the sidewalk periodically but no longer did so.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farley said officials would return to the site ''and try to do something: We are aware of the problem.''</p>
