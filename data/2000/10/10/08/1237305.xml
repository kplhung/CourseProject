        <p>The Europeans brought their pie-charts (the French call them camemberts) to the United Nations to demonstrate how much the European Union gave to the organization's various budgets compared with the richer United States, and why Washington did not deserve the cut in dues demanded by Congress. European and American shares of the world's total gross national product, on which basic national dues are assessed, are about the same: 29 percent.</p>
        <p>But the Europeans pay 36.7 percent of the United Nations' regular budget of $1 billion a year, compared with the Americans' 25 percent (when Washington pays at all). Congress wants that lowered to 22 percent, or it will withhold even more payments. In peacekeeping, the gap is wider: 39 percent for Europe, 25 percent for the United States.</p>
