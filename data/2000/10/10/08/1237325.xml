        <p>Last December, Christie's, the London-based auction house, was forcing out its chief executive, Christopher M. Davidge, who had fallen from favor with the company's new owner. Christie's executives and lawyers played tough and negotiations turned bitter as Christmas approached.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge, a third-generation Christie's employee attuned to slights in an upper-class society where he never felt comfortable, was angered over what he regarded as a paltry severance package, two friends said.</p>
        <p>After all, he had driven Christie's from perennial second place to the equal of its longtime rival, Sotheby's. But the friends said he was more worried that he was being set up to take the blame if a dormant antitrust investigation by the United States Justice Department in New York ever came to life.</p>
        <p>So when Christie's demanded all of his business records, Mr. Davidge turned the tables and produced a bonanza. He dug out private files of his handwritten notes to Christie's one-time chairman, Sir Anthony Tennant, and gave them to his lawyer, who, by late December, had dumped them in the laps of the company's criminal lawyers in New York. The impact still reverberates through the $4 billion-a-year auction world, which will never be the same.</p>
        <p>Those files described years of price fixing and collusion between Mr. Davidge and his counterpart at Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks. They recounted secret conversations and meetings in apartments, restaurants and limousines to discuss fixing the commissions paid by thousands of customers, dividing up superrich clients and a host of other steps to stifle competition and pump up profits.</p>
        <p>The nearly 500 pages, filled with incriminating detail, were a road map to what A. Douglas Melamed, a senior Justice Department official, described last week as ''classic cartel behavior -- price fixing, pure and simple.''</p>
        <p>The impact of the records was immediate at Christie's. Before January was out, the auction house threw itself at the mercy of the government, offering to cooperate in exchange for amnesty from prosecution.</p>
        <p>Interviews in recent months with lawyers, auction house employees and other people involved in the criminal and civil cases stemming from the arrangement between the auction houses provided new information about how the scandal unfolded and where it might be headed. Because the investigation is continuing and the civil settlement has not been approved by the judge, most of those interviewed spoke on the condition that their names not be used.</p>
        <p>Through his lawyer, Mr. Davidge turned away all requests for interviews. Ms. Brooks declined to be interviewed while the case is pending.</p>
        <p>But coupled with court records and other documents, the interviews provide a stark account of how a nearly defunct antitrust investigation grew into a supercharged inquiry that is exacting hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and has changed the world of auctions.</p>
        <p>The material shows that the two dominant auction houses, which offer substantially the same services to the sellers and buyers of fine art and antiques, conspired for at least six years to eliminate the only bargaining tool available to their clients -- the ability to negotiate on the basis of fees.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, Christie's refusal to be generous with its departing chief executive might be one of history's clearest lessons in being penny-wise and pound-foolish.</p>
        <p>Resignations and Pleas</p>
        <p>Throughout the year, the scandal has unfolded amid the drama of resignations by Ms. Brooks, 50, and her boss, A. Alfred Taubman, 75, the chairman of Sotheby's, as well as a $512 million settlement of civil suits against the auction houses and, most recently, guilty pleas to criminal charges by Ms. Brooks and Sotheby's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taubman, who owns a controlling interest in the Manhattan-based Sotheby's,  was forced to resign as chairman in February. He has been named by the government as a focus of its investigation. Mr. Taubman  and Sir Anthony, both of whom have been identified by Mr. Davidge as the instigators of the collusion, have denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Taubman and Sir Anthony declined requests for interviews.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the inquiry is Mr. Davidge, 55, the former chief executive who never really fit in at the stuffy pinnacle of the British upper class, where bloodlines and old-school ties are prized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge was the third generation of his family employed by Christie's and by far the most successful. But he never forgot the fate of the first family member to work there, his grandfather. He was a clerk at Christie's when he died at 44.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, Mr. Davidge described to a friend what the family said had followed his grandfather's death. Two Christie's representatives paid a call on his grandmother and explained that she would get a pension of seven pounds a month, a miserly amount even at the time. As part of the deal, they suggested she send her young son, Roy, to work at the auction house.</p>
        <p>Roy Davidge rose to company secretary, an administrative post, but he never earned enough to move his family out of public housing. Still, he persuaded his son Christopher, who was 20, to join the firm as an  apprentice printer in 1965.</p>
        <p>It is a wonder young Davidge took the job. In an interview several years ago with The Sunday Telegraph of London, he said he grew up disliking Christie's because of its treatment of his father, who died at 54. ''The chap next door who worked as a butcher's assistant earned more than my father,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Despite his resentment, or perhaps because of it, Mr. Davidge excelled. Within a decade, he was running the printing operation. By 1985, he was managing director in charge of the British operation. By 1993 he took over everything as chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge's business acumen and heavy promotional spending to woo customers increased sales and finally propelled Christie's over Sotheby's to No. 1 in sales revenue in 1997, ending 43 years in second place. But the ascension came at a price as he drew the wrath of the old guard by unceremoniously replacing deadwood with aggressive younger employees.</p>
        <p>For all his success, Mr. Davidge, with his blow-dried hair, gold jewelry and custom-made suits with pink linings, never fit into the clubby atmosphere. He once told The Financial Times that the place was ''like the Conservative Party, full of pomposity, arrogance, filled with people from a narrow social circle, who were not commercially aware.''</p>
        <p>''They recognized that the place needed a manager,'' he said, ''but wanted to limit my involvement to below stairs.''</p>
        <p>In 1992, faced with a possible hostile takeover and a declining market, Christie's board had turned directly to the business world for a new chairman -- Sir Anthony, who was the chairman of Guinness, the large beverage company. Unlike Mr. Davidge, his social pedigree was impeccable, from his education at Eton and Cambridge to knighthood.</p>
        <p>Sir Anthony, 70, had taken the helm of Guinness in 1987 when it was recovering from a stock-trading scandal. By the time he left, he was credited with turning it into one of the world's most profitable beverage companies.</p>
        <p>The secret to his success, he told The Financial Times in 1991, was forming marketing and distribution alliances with competitors. By the time he left Guinness it had joint venture agreements with 30 competitors, which effectively divided the European market for premium drinks among the companies. While the tactics did not raise eyebrows in Europe, they would likely have come under scrutiny in the stringent antitrust atmosphere in the United States.</p>
        <p>Accord Dated to 1993</p>
        <p>The conspiracy between the two houses started at least as early as April 1993, according to admissions by Ms. Brooks and Sotheby's in Federal District Court in Manhattan last week. That would have been within months of Sir Anthony's arrival at Christie's in January 1993.</p>
        <p>In statements to federal antitrust prosecutors, Mr. Davidge said Sir Anthony told him he had met with Mr. Taubman, the Sotheby's chairman, and that the two men had agreed to make their businesses more profitable by coordinating various matters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge said that Sir Anthony then instructed him to meet with Ms. Brooks, who was running Sotheby's American operation, to work out the details, said several people involved in the investigation.</p>
        <p>One document turned over by Mr. Davidge was a memorandum to him from Sir Anthony that could be interpreted as authorizing the scheme after a meeting with Mr. Taubman, people who have seen it said.</p>
        <p>In another memorandum after Mr. Davidge expressed anxiety about laws in the United States, Sir Anthony wrote that Mr. Davidge should not worry about regulators,  these people said.</p>
        <p>Most of the voluminous Davidge records, however, are his handwritten reports to Sir Anthony about meetings with Ms. Brooks, covering the subjects they discussed and outlining the agreements they reached.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how much evidence there is that Mr. Taubman or Sir Anthony initiated the conspiracy or intended to break any laws. Ms. Brooks has told prosecutors that she was acting on the instructions of Mr. Taubman and that she reported to him frequently, said participants in the interview.</p>
        <p>Early in her career at Sotheby's, Ms. Brooks and Mr. Taubman became close, developing something of a father-daughter relationship, Sotheby's employees have said.</p>
        <p>But there were times, auction house officials said, when it was unclear just who was boss. The Yale-educated Ms. Brooks, strikingly tall and exuberant, was known for her strong personality, volatile temper and big ego. Over the years she wanted to be perceived as the face and voice of the auction house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taubman admired her energy, her ideas and, some employees say, her upper-class background. She was reared on the North Shore of Long Island. Mr. Taubman, who grew up poor in Detroit, was a self-made millionaire many times over from developing shopping centers. He was not part of the jet set collectors who make up Sotheby's top client list. Yet he yearned for the glamorous life.</p>
        <p>In 1983 he acquired the majority holding in Sotheby's and moved quickly up the social ladder with his wife, Judy, a former Miss Israel. The status he attained in controlling Sotheby's brought him invitations to hunts at English country houses and society parties in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taubman occasionally rubbed elbows with Sir Anthony at social events in Britain or the United States, but people close to Mr. Taubman contended that the two men never discussed business or collusion at these events.</p>
        <p>Some of those involved in the investigation say other people at both auction houses knew of the conspiracy. But in the plea bargain with Sotheby's, the Justice Department said it would not charge anyone at the company except Ms. Brooks and possibly Mr. Taubman, as long as the employees  cooperated.</p>
        <p>In any case, according to Ms. Brooks's own guilty plea and accounts from lawyers and other people involved in the investigation, the conspiracy was carried out by Mr. Davidge and Ms. Brooks, who met secretly many times over six years and designed schemes that cheated customers by limiting competition.</p>
        <p>Collusion on Sellers' Fees</p>
        <p>One early meeting occurred at Ms. Brooks's rambling apartment off Lexington Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Another time, Mr. Davidge took the Concorde from London to New York, met Ms. Brooks in the back of a limousine near Kennedy Airport and returned by Concorde the same day. Other conversations took place in out-of-the-way restaurants in London and New York where neither of them  was likely to be recognized.</p>
        <p>In recent months, prosecutors struggled to establish collusion between the two houses when they set identical fees charged to buyers in 1993. But the 1993 buyers' action did not figure in last week's guilty pleas by Sotheby's and Ms. Brooks. In any case, Ms. Brooks and Sotheby's admitted that there had been collusion between the two houses in early 1995 on sellers' fees, not long after Ms. Brooks was promoted from president of Sotheby's America to chief executive of the entire company.</p>
        <p>That March, Christie's announced that it was increasing the fee charged to sellers at its auctions. Previously, sellers had paid a flat fee of 10 percent of the value of the item sold. The change replaced the flat fee with a sliding scale that ranged from 2 percent to 20 percent, depending on the value of the item. Six weeks later. Sotheby's followed suit, announcing an identical fee structure.</p>
        <p>What was not disclosed was that Mr. Davidge and Ms. Brooks had agreed on the structure in advance and even decided that Christie's would announce it first, according to court records. They also agreed to exchange lists of preferred customers at each house who were not charged a seller's fee or were charged lower fees because their collections were so eagerly sought by the  houses. Those customers could be exempt from the new structure, but new exemptions were prohibited, according to the agreement.</p>
        <p>Fixing the fees and exchanging the lists limited the bargaining ability of thousands of people who wanted to sell works at either of the houses, which together dominate the industry with more than 90 percent of the business worldwide. It was also a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which prohibits combinations in restraint of trade. The agreement to fix sellers' fees was to become a major element of future civil suits against the auction houses.</p>
        <p>Cheating Monitor Reported</p>
        <p>The Davidge files recount more than the fixing of commission fees. Lawyers who have seen the files say they describe a meeting at which Mr. Davidge and Ms. Brooks agreed to restrict the ability of sellers to negotiate the terms of loans they received before the sale of works. Auction houses commonly lend a seller money before a sale, often to cover such things as estate taxes. The interest rate on the loan is negotiable. But Ms. Brooks and Mr. Davidge set a minimum interest rate, though it is unclear whether they adhered to the agreement.</p>
        <p>Another matter the two executives discussed was monitoring each other for possible cheating, said people and documents filed by the government in the Brooks plea. The two exchanged their preferred client lists as a way of policing each other and actually held meetings at which they discussed the issue of cheating, people involved in the investigation said. They also agreed to stop making charitable contributions to woo sellers like family foundations, museums and libraries, the Justice Department said.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's and Christie's were so dominant that anyone who wanted a job in the upper reaches of the auction world had to work at one of those two houses. To keep employees in check and salaries down, Mr. Davidge and Ms. Brooks discussed informing each other when senior people from the opposing house applied for a job with them, according to one of the Davidge memorandums. It is uncertain whether the anti-poaching scheme was implemented.</p>
        <p>In 1997, two years after the new commission structure for sellers was implemented,  a chill cut through the auction and art industry in New York. For reasons that have never been made public, prosecutors in the New York office of the Justice Department's antitrust division issued subpoenas for records from 17 galleries and the two big auction houses. Truckloads of records, from phone logs and date books to internal correspondence and sales catalogs, were hauled away from Christie's and Sotheby's.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the galleries formed an ad hoc committee and met to discuss the investigation, but lawyers for the two auction houses declined to attend, saying they had done nothing wrong, said gallery owners who were involved in the committee.</p>
        <p>Weeks passed and the federal investigation seemed to be going nowhere. The threat seemed to fade as the auction business boomed alongside the soaring stock market.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Francois Pinault, a wealthy Frenchman whose holdings included Printemps, France's biggest department store, and Chateau Latour winery, bought Christie's for $1.2 billion.</p>
        <p>The new owner and Mr. Davidge did not hit it off. People who worked at Christie's said Mr. Pinault found Mr. Davidge's management style to be abrasive and the personal styles of the two men clashed. Further, Mr. Pinault had a history of buying a company, studying it for a year and then replacing the top management.</p>
        <p>By late last year, Mr. Davidge was on his way out. What remained was deciding a severance package suitable to cushion the fall. But Christie's negotiators were reluctant to meet his demands.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was only a negotiating tactic by the auction house, but Mr. Davidge felt the company was setting him up to take the blame if the dormant antitrust investigation  resurfaced, friends said. He became nervous enough to seek advice from a defense lawyer from Chicago, William Joseph Linklater, who had been involved in several high-profile antitrust cases in recent years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge then produced his correspondence with Sir Anthony, and Mr. Linklater turned it over to Christie's criminal lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in New York. Because of the subpoena issued in 1997, the lawyers were obligated to turn over the records to prosecutors.</p>
        <p>A provision of antitrust law allows one of the participants in a scheme to receive  amnesty in exchange for coming forward and disclosing everything it knows about the illegal activities. By mid-January, Christie's lawyers had approached the prosecutors and received amnesty for the company and its executives, including Mr. Davidge, who officially left the firm on Dec. 24.</p>
        <p>Within days, word had reached Ms. Brooks that the government investigation had resumed with a passion. Lawyers involved in the inquiry said Ms. Brooks received permission from Sotheby's to approach the prosecutors and ask for amnesty for herself. She was told that she was too late. Amnesty is limited to one party and Christie's had beaten her to the door.</p>
        <p>The first public word came last Jan. 28, when Christie's disclosed in a statement that it ''recently became aware of information relevant to the antitrust investigation'' and turned it over to the government.</p>
        <p>Two days later, Herbert Black, a Montreal collector, filed the first civil lawsuit against the two auction houses, accusing  them of fixing prices. Within weeks, hundreds of separate suits would be filed and later consolidated into one class-action suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The fallout continued. On Feb. 21, Ms. Brooks and Mr. Taubman resigned from Sotheby's. Members of Sotheby's board said Mr. Taubman resisted for three days, arguing passionately that he had done nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>Chill Between Houses</p>
        <p>As events spun out, the atmosphere at Sotheby's and Christie's grew chilly. Experts who thought they were competing tooth-and-nail for the best property felt angry and personally betrayed. Many were  vocal in their disgust, saying that the company heads had not just cheated customers but their staffs as well.</p>
        <p>The skirmishing intensified on two fronts. Both auction houses were desperate to limit the fallout and officials telephoned and visited major customers in an effort to calm them. At the same time, the houses were fighting a rising number of civil suits in Federal District Court in Manhattan, where lawyers for customers were being led by the  firm of Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks negotiated with prosecutors through the summer, trying to structure a plea bargain in which she could avoid a prison sentence. In interviews with prosecutors, she and one of her lawyers, Stephen E. Kaufman, said she could provide evidence about Mr. Taubman's role in the antitrust scheme, people who sat in on the sessions said. The government refused to guarantee no prison time and she faces up to three years and a potentially huge fine.</p>
        <p>In pleading guilty on Thursday, Ms. Brooks agreed to let Judge Richard N. Berman determine whether her cooperation warranted probation or prison. She is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 5.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said in court papers on Thursday that Mr. Taubman was now the sole target of the ongoing inquiry at Sotheby's. Ms. Brooks's guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the government means Mr. Taubman may face incriminating testimony from his one-time protege.</p>
        <p>In a statement after the Brooks plea, Mr. Taubman vowed to fight in court if necessary and said, ''Whatever Ms. Brooks chose to do, she did completely on her own without my knowledge or approval.''</p>
        <p>He has already agreed to pay $156 million of the $256 million Sotheby's will contribute to settle the civil suits, plus another $30 million to settle a stockholders' suit. Christie's will pay an equal $256 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidge has been interviewed several times in New York by prosecutors, explaining the significance of his memorandums and filling in details about his meetings with Ms. Brooks, said lawyers involved in the case. As long as they continue to cooperate, he and Christie's are safe from prosecution under the amnesty agreement and the auction house indemnified its former chief executive against any civil damages. Sir Anthony, who left Christie's in 1996, is not covered by the amnesty because he has refused to cooperate with the investigation, top Christie's officials said.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Davidge negotiated a severance package worth about $7.5 million, though $3 million is being withheld until he completes his cooperation in the case, according to court documents</p>
        <p>Of late, Mr. Davidge has been seen frequently at London's better restaurants and he recently sent out invitations to his wedding in December, when he will marry an Indian woman who used to work at Christie's. Some invitations included first-class tickets to India for the ceremony, said people who received them.</p>
