        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I'm not embarrassed to say I've been watching ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' since Day One. As Steve Vineberg pointed out, the show has been misperceived by the general public as campy or teen-oriented. The fact is that there are many viewers like me -- a 45-year-old man -- who watch the show not because it tells stories about teenagers, but rather because of its terrific writing. Indeed, it ranks on my list of must-see TV, right along with the equally well-written ''E.R.,''  ''The Sopranos,''  ''Law and Order,''  ''The X-Files'' and ''The West Wing.'' Joss Whedon and his staff consistently put out one of the best series on television, one that not only unfailingly entertains but also stretches the limits of what series television can be.</p>
