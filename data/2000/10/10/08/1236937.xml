        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article on Riverside Drive [''A Serene Setting Above the Hudson,'' Oct. 1], an area I have been privileged to call home for most of my life, mentions Grant's Tomb as one of the monuments that add ''a sense of history'' to the drive. Indeed, this treasured monument recently underwent substantial renovation to restore its original splendor. Visitors and neighborhood residents have long admired this edifice, particularly after dark, when it is illuminated dramatically against the night sky.</p>
        <p>What many readers may not know is that Grant's Tomb is currently being obscured by the construction of a monolithic building commissioned by the Manhattan School of Music. What was formerly a striking view from across 123rd Street is now obliterated, and the monument can no longer be seen from most of the east side of Broadway in the immediate vicinity.</p>

        <p>The music school, which rushed into construction before appropriate feedback or objection could be voiced by the community, has refused to consider any modifications in terms of height or other accommodation. What a shame that one institution's selfishness is compromising the beauty of this proud monument.  PEGGY THOMSON  Manhattan</p>
