        <p>Americans are now expected to spend decades of their lives -- not years -- in retirement, and that may not be a good thing, according to a researcher at the International Longevity Center-USA, a nonprofit group in New York.</p>

        <p>Americans are now expected to spend decades of their lives -- not years -- in retirement, and that may not be a good thing, according to a researcher at the International Longevity Center-USA, a nonprofit group in New York.</p>
        <p>''Twenty or twenty-five years of retirement may sound pretty good to people who have worked hard all their lives, but whether it's good for their health, or the health of the nation, is another matter,'' said Dr. Robert N. Butler, president of the group and a co-editor of a book, ''Longevity and Quality of Life: Opportunities and Challenges.''</p>
        <p>''Inactivity is one of the greatest threats to the physical and mental health of older people,'' Dr. Butler said.</p>
        <p>It turns out that Americans agree. Findings from a recent national survey suggest that workers want to continue to work after full-time employment -- but on their own terms. In the survey, by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers and the Center for Survey Research and Analysis at the University of Connecticut, 1,005 workers, chosen at random, were interviewed between Aug. 4 and 31.</p>
        <p>Three-fourths of the workers said they would like to retire early from their permanent, full-time jobs. But only 10 percent of those surveyed said they would stop working after leaving those positions.</p>
        <p>Nearly 70 percent said they would continue to work even if they had enough money to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.</p>
