        <p>Taking an Auto Plant Tour</p>
        <p>Q. For part of a proposed trip through ''blue collar'' America, could you list auto plants that offer tours in the mid-Atlantic states and or in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois? -- Howard S. Edelstein, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Auto plants open to the public for general interest tours are a rarity in the area you mention. But there is one in Illinois. Wherever you go, what you see is likely to include painted bodies moving along an assembly line, doors removed to make it easier to install interior trim, instrument panels, seats and other parts; and then engines and transmissions put in and the key turned in the ignition for the first time.</p>

        <p>Taking an Auto Plant Tour</p>
        <p>Q. For part of a proposed trip through ''blue collar'' America, could you list auto plants that offer tours in the mid-Atlantic states and or in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois? -- Howard S. Edelstein, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Auto plants open to the public for general interest tours are a rarity in the area you mention. But there is one in Illinois. Wherever you go, what you see is likely to include painted bodies moving along an assembly line, doors removed to make it easier to install interior trim, instrument panels, seats and other parts; and then engines and transmissions put in and the key turned in the ignition for the first time.</p>
        <p>Tours usually require reservations and run 60 to 90 minutes. It's a good idea to call before going since schedules do change. The use of cameras is not permitted, and some plants, citing safety reasons, ask that visitors not wear open-toed shoes. The minimum age for visitors can range from 6 to 14. Admission is free unless otherwise indicated.</p>
        <p>In Normal, Ill., there's a Mitsubishi plant that makes the Mitsubishi Galant, Eclipse and Spyder and the Dodge Stratus and Sebring. (Mitsubishi is owned in part by DaimlerChrysler.) The schedule changes quarterly: through Dec. 15, tours will given on Friday at 9:15 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Information: (309) 888-8203.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the United States, you can choose from the following:</p>
        <p>ALABAMA  The Mercedes-Benz plant and museum in Vance, (888) 286-8762, gives tours Monday to Friday, 9, 9:15, 11 and 11:15 a.m., and 1 and 1:15 p.m. Admission includes the museum, where you can see a three-wheel motorized Benz carriage from the 1880's and a 1907 Simplex. Admission: $4, $3 seniors; free for Mercedes-Benz Car Club of America members. On Saturday, the plant is closed, but the museum is open, free.</p>
        <p>KENTUCKY  The Chevrolet Corvette plant in Bowling Green, (270) 745-8287, has tours from Monday to Friday at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Displays at the National Corvette Museum, (800) 538-3883, include one of the first Corvettes (1953) and the only 1983 model (no 1983 models were sold because they didn't measure up to G.M. standards). Hours: seven days a week 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $8, $6 seniors, $20 for a family.</p>
        <p>At the Ford plant in Louisville, three models of S.U.V.'s -- the Explorer Spirit, Mountaineer, Sport and Sport Trac -- are made. Tours are given on Monday at 9 a.m. Information: (502) 364-3625.</p>
        <p>The Toyota plant in Georgetown, where the Camry, Avalon and Sienna Minivan are made, runs a tour by tram Monday to Friday at 10 a.m., noon and 2 p.m. and a 6 p.m. tour on Thursday. Information: (800) 866-4485 or (502) 868-4036.</p>
        <p>SOUTH CAROLINA  The BMW plant in Spartanburg, (888) 868-7269, has a visitors center and a museum, where the highlights include a 1930 Dixi (the first vehicle BMW produced) and at least 2 of the 15 Art Cars, cars that such people as Robert Rauschenberg have made into a work of art. Tours from Tuesday to Friday at 10 and 10:15 a.m. and 12:15, 12:30, 2 and 2:15 p.m. Admission: $5, $3.50 for students and BMW Car Club owners.</p>
        <p>TENNESSEE  The site of the Spring Hill plant, which makes Saturns, is a bit of surprise: it's an old farm for walking horses, and the barn is now a welcome center. Tours of the plant, aboard a tram, run at 10 a.m. and 1, 2:30 and 3:30 p.m. on Monday and at those times plus 8:30 a.m. from Tuesday to Thursday. Information: (800) 326-3321.</p>
        <p>The Nissan plant in Smyrna makes the Altima, the Xterra sport utility vehicle and Frontier pickup trucks. Tours, by tram, run Tuesday at 8:30 and 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Information: (615) 459-1444.</p>
        <p>To France With a Niece</p>
        <p>Q. I am making plans to escort my 15-year-old niece on her first trip to France. Since she is a minor and I am not her parent, do I need any paperwork in case of emergencies, either medical or involving immigration officials? -- Pamela Whitney Hawkes, Boston</p>
        <p>A. Perhaps you're thinking of a country such as Mexico where notarized parental consent is required in the situation you describe. Not so for holders of American passports visiting France, said Remi Marechaux, deputy director of the press section at the French Embassy in Washington. But he did say it would be useful to have a notarized letter from your niece's parents authorizing you to take charge of their daughter.</p>
        <p>As for medical assistance, Dr. Michel Lavollay, counselor for health at the embassy, said that in a life-threatening situation, help would be provided for your niece without awaiting authorization. In a nonemergency case, he said, parents can authorize an adult to act, as they would, for example, authorize a school to act in loco parentis.</p>
        <p>If an authorization includes a reference to medical decisions, having a translation into French is recommended, since it could remove any possible obstacle, Dr. Lavollay said. He also suggested that the authorization list conditions such as allergies.</p>
        <p>Visiting West Point</p>
        <p>Q. I am interested in attending a cadet parade at West Point. What is the schedule? -- Grace L. Dougherty, Southbury, Conn.</p>
        <p>A. Parades, better known as reviews, take place on the Plain, the Point's parade ground, and typically last 30 to 40 minutes, with the cadets marching to the music of the West Point Military Band. Since reviews are scheduled whenever there are Saturday home football games, you will have a chance to attend on Oct. 21 at 9 a.m. (with the entire corps of 4,000 cadets marching) and Nov. 4 and 18, both at 10 a.m., with half the corps. On Saturday, Oct. 28, on plebe parent weekend, first-year cadets will march at 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>Parades resume in the spring. Usually, there are a few in April and several in May, most of them when the school year ends. Reviews do not take place in heavy rain. Information: the visitors center, (845) 938-2638, or www.usma.edu.</p>
        <p>While at the Point, you can visit the museum free and roam the grounds. There's a one-hour tour for $6 ($3 for children under 12) given by West Point Tours, (845) 446-4724. It runs about every 30 to 40 minutes between 10 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and on Sunday from 11 to 3:30. Saturday tours are not held when there is a home football game, and from Nov. 1 to March 31 there are one-hour tours only at 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. A two-hour tour runs less frequently and costs $8 and $5. It includes the old Cadet Chapel and the old cemetery where such people as the generals George Custer and Winfield Scott and the football coach Red Blaik are buried.</p>
