        <p>NEXT month, in Ames, Iowa, Iona College has a shot at finishing in the Final Four. But this is the national championship in cross country, not basketball, the sport that usually draws all the attention at this small college on North Avenue here.</p>
        <p>The school's basketball coach, Jeff Ruland, can only dream of having as strong a starting five as Mick Byrne's top five runners.</p>
        <p>Last Saturday, in their first meet of the year, Iona narrowly defeated William &amp; Mary College of Williamsburg, Va., to win its own Meet of  Champions at its home course in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. Twenty-two other colleges competed, including Alabama and Kentucky, but it was Iona's race to win or lose.</p>
        <p>That's the clout a team holds when it begins the year as the fourth-ranked team in the country, behind only Stanford, Colorado and Arkansas. Providence College has since slipped ahead of Iona in the national rankings, but the Gaels are a determined and diverse bunch. Of its top seven runners, two are from Ireland, two from Britain, two from the United States and one is from Spain.</p>
        <p>''And they all get along,'' Byrne said, jokingly. He is a Dublin native who has been coaching at Iona for 16 years. ''It's all about recruiting. I have a lot of connections in Ireland and I go over once or twice a year. But I also go to the European Junior Championships every year, too. Ninety-five percent of Division I cross-country colleges have international students on their teams.''</p>
        <p>No Iona team has ever held a national ranking as high as the cross-country team does now. The runners agree it all comes down to hard training and chemistry.</p>
        <p>''I love all these guys,'' said Jay Wassell, a 22-year-old fifth-year senior from New Jersey. ''We're all really good friends. It'd be nice to have some more Americans. But we have a diverse group and I want seven guys on the line that want to win as bad as I do.''</p>
        <p>At the Meet of Champions, Vincent Mulvey from Dublin led Iona's charge finishing fifth in 24:46. Miguel Pinto of Salamanca, Spain, finished sixth, four seconds later. Graeme Reid of Glasgow was ninth, five seconds later and Wassell finished 14th, 14 seconds after Reid.</p>
        <p>What nearly cost Iona the race to fifteenth-ranked William &amp; Mary was that one top Iona runner, Peter Riley of Manchester, England, dropped out of the five-mile race after two miles with calf cramps. Corey Ricci-Munn, an American, did not race because of an illness.</p>
        <p>But the team hopes to peak at the National Championships on the campus of Iowa State University.</p>
        <p>Last year the Gaels finished ninth in the nation and if their current ranking is accurate, they have an excellent shot at finishing in the top four teams this year. So the team is treaining through these early races so they will be at their best on Nov. 20.</p>
        <p>For Mulvey, an all-American last year, that means running 92 miles in training runs and two interval speed workouts the week before the meet.</p>
        <p>''You have to train hard,'' said Mulvey, a 22-year-old senior, who at 5-foot-4 and 118 pounds is one of the smallest, gifted runners in the college ranks. ''Hard training will get you further than talent. Obviously, you have to have a good heart and lungs, but not everyone can make the sacrifice.''</p>
        <p>For Mulvey, that means getting up early with the rest of the team and  putting in the miles on the Leatherstocking Trails in the Bronx or the trails in the Nature Center behind New Rochelle High School. Longer afternoon runs occur after classes on the road or up at the Rockerfeller Estates in Tarrytown. It even means forgoing the Guinness.</p>
        <p>''Running is 90 percent mental,'' said Mulvey, in his thick Irish brogue. ''A race is like a poker game. I look around to see the reactions on the other guy's faces and listen to their breathing. They're doing the same thing. You keep some cards close to your chest and try to fool people into thinking you're feeling better than you are.''</p>
        <p>The Van Cortlandt course is one of the most famous and toughest in the  country. Cemetery Hill in the woods has stranded many runners over the years and asphalt paths on the course grind down runners' legs. Mulvey, Pinto and Reid were still able to run sub-5 minute miles over the entire course, prompting Reid to say, ''We were ripping it up.''</p>
        <p>Why are the Irish and British runners so good in long-distance races?</p>
        <p>''I think it has to do with maturity,'' said Mulvey, who is expected to qualify for the Irish national team that will run in the World Cross-Country Championships in Dublin in March. ''We run 8-kilometer races when we're 17, whereas American kids run only 5-kilometer high school  meets. We have a good work ethic, too.''</p>
        <p>Byrne said, ''Traditionally, a lot more of the Irish and British kids come from the countryside where the nearest school is 5 to 10 miles away. Cross-country is a glory sport in Ireland. I don't know why it isn't here.''</p>
        <p>Wassell believes it is the ''truest sport.''</p>
        <p>''It's man versus man,'' he said. ''A lot of people in other sports can convince themselves that they're the best if they score a lot of points. But some of the best cross-country runners ever, like Eammon Coghlin and Marcus O'Sullivan, ran this exact course and we can compare our times to theirs.''</p>
        <p>But Byrne points out that cross-country is a team sport and if Iona is to win the college's first national championship in any sport, every runner will have to ''hit it right'' in Iowa.</p>
        <p>''When you get to this level of competition, anything can happen.''</p>
