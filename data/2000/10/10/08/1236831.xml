        <p>The Fourth Great Awakening &amp; the Future</p>
        <p>Of Egalitarianism</p>
        <p>By Robert William Fogel.</p>

        <p>If poor people today grow nearly as tall, live almost as long and surf roughly as many cable channels as rich people, shouldn't liberals stop whining? If the spiritual benefits of education are so indispensable that funds for lifelong learning (especially for needy kids and depressed older people) need to rise by a stunning $400 billion each year, shouldn't conservatives pay up? It gives you some feel for how ideologically refreshing the latest book by Robert Fogel, the 1993 Nobel laureate in economic science, is that his answer to both these questions is a matter-of-fact yes. ''The Fourth Great Awakening &amp; the Future of Egalitarianism'' is an ambitious effort to account for the cycles of reform in American history. While its religious-historical framework is a bit overwrought, Fogel's book is remarkable for weaving insights from history, religion, biology, nutrition, demography, economics and even a field called ''technophysio evolution'' into an integrated perspective that suggests how the priorities of today's left and right might meld into a powerful new egalitarian agenda to complete the nation's unfinished business.</p>
        <p>Shunning the prejudices of current political debate, in which the label ''egalitarian'' is even more fatal than ''liberal,'' Fogel argues that ''the egalitarian creed . . . is at the core of American political culture.'' Much of political history, he argues, involves the swing between rival interpretations of this creed, one emphasizing ''equality of opportunity,'' the other ''equality of condition.'' The ebb and flow of these reform paradigms, Fogel says, has turned on whether the prevailing religious ethic viewed poverty and disadvantage as the wages of sin, or as the by-product of broader flaws in society.</p>
        <p>Fogel traces this battle through America's previous religious awakenings. The first, in the mid-1700's, saw revivalist leaders assail the corrupt church hierarchy, helping fuel the related war on British rule in the American Revolution. The second great awakening, starting in the early 1800's and peaking at midcentury, preached the struggle against sin as the path to grace, and gave rise to the temperance and abolitionist movements. The third great awakening, stretching from 1890 to 1930 and beyond, was born in the flood of displaced farm workers and new immigrants to the cities and led to the reforms associated with the Progressives, the New Deal and, eventually, the Great Society. Fogel's fourth great awakening began in the 1960's and shapes politics today. Nearly a third of the electorate now claims membership in ''enthusiastic religion,'' powering the anti-abortion, antitax and welfare reform movements. Partly in response to the exhaustion of the third awakening's redistributive agenda, Fogel argues, the religious pendulum has swung back toward an emphasis on individual responsibility.</p>
        <p>Fogel concedes that his analysis ends up ''tying political history far more closely to religion than some historians consider warranted.'' Most readers will, I think, agree. It may be true, as Fogel contends, that ''the evangelical churches represent the leading edge'' of reform in our society. But it's hard not to view the Depression as the truer inspiration of the New Deal agenda, to cite just one example. And when Fogel recasts familiar battles (like the clash between labor and business at the turn of the century) as showdowns between the end of one awakening and the rise of another, the results feel forced.</p>
        <p>Luckily, these aspects of Fogel's framework are easy to skip over, allowing one to feast on the surprising and illuminating data he has culled from various disciplines. Consider: Life expectancy in New York and Philadelphia in the 1830's averaged 24 years, six years less than that of Southern slaves. Nutrition was so poor in the early 1900's that one-third of American men were deemed too weak to serve in World War I. Our species has so mastered our environment that we've increased our body size by 50 percent and life spans by more than 100 percent in just 300 years. The saturation of consumer goods is so complete that American homes now boast more than one radio per ear.</p>
        <p>These facts and hundreds like them help Fogel to make his case that life is vastly better today, even for the worst-off Americans. Which raises a provocative question: what is the proper angle of vision for reformers -- the long historical view, or a look down today's mean streets? If your standards for outrage are set by the ages, little on the current American scene seems a cause for alarm. But the long view can be so olympian as to counsel a weirdly informed indifference to the fate of millions with scant hope.</p>
        <p>It is a measure of Fogel's subtlety that he is able to encompass both perspectives. Even as he catalogs the country's enormous progress, he's filled with ideas about what should come next. Fogel is aware that government played a big role in increasing incomes and life spans for the poor over the last century, largely through subsidies for education, pensions and public health. Indeed, he sees the ''egalitarian revolution'' of the 20th century as a huge success save for one thing: the ''glaring failure to promote moral behavior'' in a society more prone today than a century ago to teenage pregnancy, single motherhood, drug addiction and crime. In Fogel's view, ''immaterial'' goods -- a sense of purpose, a commitment to family and a work ethic -- are now more important than mere cash in lifting up the poor. These spiritual gaps aren't easy to fill, since they're transferred through intimate relationships, not government handouts. Fogel thus calls for a revolutionary expansion in mentoring and similar forms of extended education, aimed at disadvantaged kids, single mothers and the elderly. With material comfort freeing ordinary Americans to seek self-realization, and productivity increases likely to make retirement at age 55 routine before long, Fogel predicts a surge in volunteerism that could go far to address the virtue gap.</p>
        <p>While this emphasis sounds conservative, Fogel insists that the next generation of reform needn't be either/or -- that Great Society liberals and tough-love conservatives should find common ground promoting education, pensions and health care, as well as curbing drugs and media violence. If his history is any guide, Fogel's dream may not come true, but it's worth hoping our politics can grope its way toward approaches as catholic and inclusive as his own vision plainly is.</p>
