        <p>In the department store, after scouring racks and squinting into mirrors, you come away with a wardrobe that will define you as a woman of charm and discernment, or maybe you vow to return when your hips are slimmer and bank balance heftier.

        <p>In the department store, after scouring racks and squinting into mirrors, you come away with a wardrobe that will define you as a woman of charm and discernment, or maybe you vow to return when your hips are slimmer and bank balance heftier. Whether laden with finds or empty-handed, you invariably drift to the cosmetics counter, where the makeup diva waits, eager not only to help you find the perfect lipstick for fall but also to reveal the secrets of beauty, if you will allow her to dab a little of this moisturizer on the back of your hand.</p>
        <p>Depending on the company she represents, she is called an artist, a stylist, a beauty consultant, a representative, an associate -- never a saleslady, although she spends seven hours a day on her feet in a store.</p>
        <p>Her job is to get the product off the shelves and into a little bag dangling from your wrist, but to hear her tell it, her job is to maximize your potential and make you feel good about yourself.</p>
        <p>According to Alexandra Salazar, the willowy, soft-spoken stylist for Calvin Klein at Saks Fifth Avenue: ''I love it when a woman sits down and leaves feeling very gratified. I love feeling that I've helped her in some way.''</p>
        <p>''It's always been inside me to make people feel better about themselves,'' reveals Dwana Evans, who vibrates energy from behind the Christian Dior counter at Lord &amp; Taylor. ''I tune into what the individual client needs.''</p>
        <p>Martine Manojlovic, the Junoesque beauty at the Sisley counter at Bergdorf Goodman, prides herself on the number of customers who return: ''A lot of people say: 'Martine, I don't know what to do. Tell me what to use. What works best for me?' I have at this point a fairly good clientele because they believe in me.''</p>
        <p>All this love and concern can powerfully attract or it can repel. It depends on how you feel about surrendering control. Once you are on that stool and under her fingers, the consultant owns you. You are playing the role of client in the public arena of the department store, and you must stay until the final curtain. Strong-willed individuals are able to hijack the scene and impose their own script, often using the stool as confessional. At Chanel, while the hapless artist tried to draw a smooth line around her lips, a shopper once jabbered about her efforts to get off psychotropic drugs.</p>
        <p>If you're like me, you fall into the Stockholm syndrome; you identify with the associate, lose all sense of who you are and end up buying everything she recommends. The last time I stopped at a counter for blush, I left glassy-eyed, lugging a five-step cleansing program, three eye shadows and some green cream I never could figure out how to use.</p>
        <p>Rumor has it that, as an incentive to push products, the consultant receives a commission. She may or may not, but it's generally a tiny 3 percent bonus. There is confusion over whom she works for. Is it the cosmetic company or the store? What kind of training has she had? Some work for the company, some work for the store and some have a joint relationship with both. Her indoctrination may emphasize sales technique, or ''customer service and addressing customer needs,'' as Laura Cicchelli, vice president of marketing for Calvin Klein Color, calls it; or it could consist solely of product information, as at Sephora, where the staff is geared to answer questions but never push a sale.</p>
        <p>Even if a representative is trained to sell, the instruction period rarely lasts a week. Her Svengali effect has more to do with your vulnerability than her selling skill. You usually get to her after shopping for clothes, which involves watching the flab on your upper arms jiggle while you pull garments on and off over your head. You are demoralized and your hair is a fright. She on the other hand looks great. You want her to make you look great, but worry that she will make you look like a clown.</p>
        <p>Rest assured that she is almost painfully schooled to obey customer wishes. The weakest negative whisper will cause her to drop the transfer tattoo. ''We get a lot of people who want the 'I'm not wearing any makeup' look,'' says Catherine Vitulli (M.A.C. at Macy's), who cheerfully complies even though she herself flaunts glitter eyeliner at 2 in the afternoon. In unguarded moments, some admit to being a little tired of the fresh face. ''I think makeup should be fun,'' says Aileen Riordan of Sephora. ''I don't think you should be scared to wear red eye shadow, you know?''</p>
        <p>If you still find the makeup diva intimidating, it may help to think of her as someone like you, a bird of passage among the lipstick displays, whose interests and dreams reach far beyond the tip of her mascara wand. Manojlovic, for instance, is a classically trained singer with a rock 'n' roll band whose music career is on hold while she focuses on her 2-year-old daughter. Dawn Glass (Trish McEvoy, Bloomingdale's) studied journalism and photography in college. Her ideal job would be working for National Geographic, taking pictures of animals and going around the world.</p>
        <p>So next time you're trolling the counters and someone with flawless eyeliner asks, ''May I help you?'' hop on that stool and let her have a go.</p>
        <p>If when you get home you can't figure out what to do with that green cream, just give a call; she'll be happy to explain it to you again.</p>
