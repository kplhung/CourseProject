        <p>AFTER its performances today in Morristown and next weekend in New Brunswick, American Repertory Ballet may want to rethink its name. The dances choreographed by its English-born director, Graham Lustig, are set to tangos by Astor Piazzolla, a Brazilian, to a piano piece by the English composer Michael Nyman, and to a concerto by Poulenc whose dance Mr. Lustig named ''Paramour.'' So, repertory of America, where are you now?</p>
        <p>It's in there somewhere. These dances may qualify for the country's famous melting pot, but the one with homegrown American credentials -- in addition to ''Angels in the Architecture,'' Mark Godden's Shaker version of Aaron Copland's ''Appalachian Spring'' -- is a brand-new ballet to film music by Bernard Herrmann. Choreographed by Kirk Peterson of American Ballet Theater and deceptively named ''Fandango Furioso,'' it combines segments from Herrmann's classic film collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock.</p>

        <p>AFTER its performances today in Morristown and next weekend in New Brunswick, American Repertory Ballet may want to rethink its name. The dances choreographed by its English-born director, Graham Lustig, are set to tangos by Astor Piazzolla, a Brazilian, to a piano piece by the English composer Michael Nyman, and to a concerto by Poulenc whose dance Mr. Lustig named ''Paramour.'' So, repertory of America, where are you now?</p>
        <p>It's in there somewhere. These dances may qualify for the country's famous melting pot, but the one with homegrown American credentials -- in addition to ''Angels in the Architecture,'' Mark Godden's Shaker version of Aaron Copland's ''Appalachian Spring'' -- is a brand-new ballet to film music by Bernard Herrmann. Choreographed by Kirk Peterson of American Ballet Theater and deceptively named ''Fandango Furioso,'' it combines segments from Herrmann's classic film collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock.</p>
        <p>The selection of ''Angels,'' ''Paramour'' and ''Fandango,'' all firsts for the New Brunswick-based company, suggests that Mr. Lustig has had a productive first year in this post, not only directing but choreographing and commissioning. These choices also display his wide-ranging interest in dances other than ballet, and forms of expression beyond dance. All three ballets are choreographed to music composed for another purpose: the concerto was intended for the concert hall, ''Appalachian Spring'' (a title Martha Graham chose at random) was not ballet but modern dance, and Mr. Peterson's new work was a film score by a Hollywood composer.</p>
        <p>The use of movie music also shows what many choreographers already know: marrying visual and musical elements can make both look better.  (In fact, Herrmann, who died in 1975, composed ballet music himself back in the Depression years.)</p>
        <p>And as often happens in filmmaking, not all the music prepared survives the editing process; accompaniments to scenes that don't make the final cut land right along with them on the cutting room floor. That was the case with the ''Fandango'' score, some of which is therefore to be heard Saturday for the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lustig described his ballet, which is for six couples, as ''plotless, with fandango moves and holds, and inherent drama because of the nature of the music.'' Menacing and urgent, the low motoric sounds show influences of ''Rite of Spring'' and ''Peter and the Wolf,'' both part of Herrmann's Russian heritage.</p>
        <p>Herrmann once said that audiences would accept avant-garde techniques provided they fit the dramatic situation. Listening to the ominous repetitive patterns in excerpts from ''Psycho,'' ''Vertigo'' and ''North by Northwest'' on the CD ''Bernard Herrmann Film Scores,'' one imagines a young minimalist like Philip Glass taking notes.</p>
        <p>Next weekend's performances are the company's first with the Princeton Symphony Orchestra, formerly called the Princeton Chamber Orchestra; the conductor is Mark Laycock. ''It's a dream come true,'' said Mr. Lustig, ''a whole program built around the orchestra.''</p>
        <p>''Paramour,'' a dance for couples in a salon, was the fruit of Mr. Lustig's trip to Paris, during which he read Anais Nin's diaries, the Henry Miller episode. Commissioned while Mr. Lustig was with the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, it featured a senior ballerina, Galina Samsova. Her role is to be danced next weekend by Kyra Nichols, a principal ballerina at the New York City ballet, and also a Princeton resident who teaches at the Ballet School. Alex Nichols, her brother, is one of the company's lighting designers, and designed ''Fandango'' and ''Paramour.''</p>
        <p>This program with orchestra is at the State Theater. Today's Community Theater performances are part of ''Discover Jersey Arts Discover Dance/New Jersey,'' a new weekend event with seven companies presenting dances and open rehearsals.  American Repertory's are ''Pas de Pizazz,'' a pas de deux with the principal dancers Douglas Martin and Mary Barton, set to Piazzolla tangos, and Mr. Lustig's new ''Standstill,'' for five girls and a boy, set to Mr. Nyman's ''The Lady in the Red Hat.''  The dancers are in Princeton Ballet School's top division, now named American Repertory Ballet Workshop. ''My hope,'' said Mr. Lustig, ''is that in time the workshop will become another arm, representing the company at hospitals and charity events.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lustig's next productions, including ''The Nutcracker,'' ''Lambarena'' and ''Turn of the Screw,'' again hover on the far borderline of American repertory. Well, hooray for the melting pot factor.</p>
