        <p>PHRAGMITES australis is thriving in a tidal marsh near you. The prodigious growth of this native species of reed grass may seem benign, but to experts in Connecticut the rapid spread of phrag, as it is called, is an ominous sign that something is not quite right.</p>
        <p>The Department of Environmental Protection's wildlife division and the state chapter of the Nature Conservancy are particularly concerned with the lower Connecticut River tidelands. The expansion of phragmites in this area is worrisome because the species had never been so invasive that far down the river. And, while such behavior is typical for an exotic, non-native species, phragmites is a native species that has been in Connecticut as long as 5,000 years, according to evidence from peat core samples.</p>
        <p>The D.E.P. and the conservancy are collaborating on a wetlands restoration project at Lords Cove in Lyme to eradicate the phragmites growing on 200 of the cove's 1,100 acres and expanding at a rate of 30 acres a year. The project requires spraying an herbicide called Rodeo, a course of action the conservancy has avoided because it prefers natural controls, but one the D.E.P. regularly uses for habitat management.</p>
        <p>''Phrag was more of an upland plant, but something happened to alter its course in the 19th century,'' said Nathan Frohling, program director of the conservancy's Tidelands project. ''Various theories have been propounded -- it's a hybrid or foreign species, it's the result of human activity that's changed the balance of nutrients in the tidelands -- but it's still not clear what has triggered it.''</p>
        <p>While research is being done on the cause, the current effort at Lords Cove and a three-year, $600,000 program by the D.E.P. at Great Island (Roger Tory Peterson refuge), South Cove and other sites along the Connecticut River are seen as emergency measures to stem the rising phragmites problem.</p>
        <p>Paul Capotosto, a D.E.P. wetlands restoration biologist who is in charge of the program, estimates that 2,000 acres of phragmites are growing almost out of control along the river.</p>
        <p>''Phrag can be a good screen for wildlife in small stands,'' Mr. Capotosto said. ''But in dense stands it takes over, growing too thickly for birds to even fly into it. It grows as tall as 15 feet and the roots go three to four feet underground, so there's no way to just yank it out. Threatened and endangered species are in danger of now being overtaken.''</p>
        <p>''Phrag is a monoculture that squeezes out all other species,'' Mr. Frohling said. ''But it isn't just the species that are endangered; it's the habitat itself, this brackish tidal marsh, that is rare.''</p>
        <p>Lords Cove, a centerpiece of the conservancy's Connecticut River Tidelands project, is home to several  bird species, including the threatened bald eagle, and 10 plant species listed as endangered, threatened or of special concern in Connecticut. It is one of 40 areas in the world that the Nature Conservancy included on its ''Last Great Places'' list in 1993 (three other places in New England were also listed: Block Island, Cape Cod and the southern Berkshires).</p>
        <p>''Tidal marshes are part of what makes the Connecticut River Tidelands great, and Lords Cove is the biggest of these brackish tidal marshes,'' Mr. Frohling said.</p>
        <p>Thus, the conservancy was willing to try the spraying with D.E.P., but only after the lengthy process of securing permission and access from 60 homeowners in the area, most of whom enthusiastically support the project.</p>
        <p>''Rodeo is a nonselective herbicide,'' Mr. Capotosto said, ''but because the phrag grows so thickly that's all it ends up killing. Compared to some of the stuff I've seen people put on those perfect Fairfield County lawns, Rodeo is benign.''</p>
        <p>Because state law prohibits aerial spraying of herbicide, the work must be done from the ground, using amphibious vehicles called argos and hydra tracks. The contractor, Aquatic Control Technology, of Sutton, Mass., uses teams of three to operate the vehicles, spraying herbicide on one 50-foot swath at a time. The company has also been hired to spray in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, which are having similar phragmite problems, and it guarantees an 85 percent eradication rate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Capotosto is satisfied with the efficacy of the program, citing a 35-acre site sprayed once two years ago. To increase the benefit, the D.E.P. sent crews into a sprayed area after the phragmites had died, to clear and mulch the newly restored soil. Today, a healthy mixture of bullrush, cattails, wild rice, sedge grass, marsh flea bane and marsh mellow (a type of hibiscus) has been restored. Phragmites has returned to about 10 acres. The D.E.P. will continue to spray through September on Great Island, on the Old Lyme side of the Connecticut River.</p>
        <p>''This is labor intensive,'' Mr. Capotosto said, ''and a lot more difficult than if we could just take a helicopter in and see exactly where we were spraying.''</p>
        <p>When asked about the conservancy's ultimate goals, Mr. Frohling said, ''We want some of the other native vegetation to return and to control the phrag to a manageable level. We would also like to help find other ways, besides spraying, to control it. People ask me, 'Why do it if it just comes back?' But we are losing this rare habitat so fast, we see this as a stop-gap measure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Capotosto tried to put the phragmites problem in perspective by comparing it with kudzu, the botanical bane of the South, which he saw for the first time on a recent trip to rural Georgia. ''Thank God, phrag isn't like kudzu,'' he said. ''That stuff just grows up and over anything that gets in its way. If we had that up here . . . wow!''</p>
