        <p>In the last few years, the Trenton police department has faced union troubles, discipline problems and a high-profile shooting that raised an outcry over the poor relationship between the police and the community. Now, the police director, with a mandate from the mayor's office, has hired the man credited with turning around New York City's mammoth police force to see if he can do the same for Trenton.</p>
        <p>William Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner, will spend several months working with the Trenton police. According to James B. Golden Jr., the Trenton police director, Mr. Bratton and a team of five consultants will help the department improve its community relations, pinpoint trouble spots and attract federal grant money to pay for the work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golden, who had applied New York's community policing strategy to his last job in Saginaw, Mich., said the plan was to reorganize the department to cover 30 neighborhood beats. He said officers would focus on preventing crime, rather than making arrests. ''Responding to incidents after they occur and arresting people is not a solution to a crime problem,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton is not someone to hide from the spotlight. Most recently, he very publicly pondered joining the New York mayoral race, only deciding recently that he would not seek the job. In a recent interview, he described his life since leaving 1 Police Plaza, including ongoing work with the police department in Fortaleza , Brazil, and meeting with an Israeli brigadier general to talk about community policing as a solution to the problems there.</p>
        <p>With 375 officers to serve a population of about 88,000, the Trenton police department is slightly smaller than a New York City  precinct. Proposed changes include many of the ideas implemented in New York and elsewhere: a computer system to target high-crime areas for more police patrols; increasing commanders' accountability for crime reduction; and assigning officers to permanent community beats.</p>
        <p>While some people, including police union officials, have voiced doubts about the plan, particularly regarding the $134,000 the city has agreed to pay Mr. Bratton, most seem to be taking a wait-and-see attitude. Both the mayor and the police director say that bringing in an outside consultant is the fastest way to fix problems that citizens have complained about for years.</p>
        <p>Changes in the department are being pushed by Mayor Douglas H. Palmer. The mayor has made no secret of his belief that the department has not done enough to control crime in Trenton, or to change the city's reputation as a dangerous, high-crime area. The union has responded by picketing his community meetings, handing out T-shirts condemning his administration, and hiring a banner-trailing airplane to fly over the city to denounce the mayor.</p>
        <p>Last year, the mayor pushed through a referendum to replace the police chief -- who was protected by civil service laws -- with a police director, who could be fired at any time. After a nationwide search, Mayor Palmer hired Mr. Golden, a former Philadelphia police captain.</p>
        <p>The most frequent complaint the mayor and the new director heard from community groups was that the police had little contact with residents other than those being arrested. Marge Caldwell-Wilson, president of the Trenton Council of Civic Associations, said the police spent their time dashing from one call to another and had little chance to know the community. ''The feeling was they did not care,'' she said. ''They came to work and then they left.''</p>
        <p>Officer Leonard Cipriano, the president of the police union local, said the rank and file officers were ''optimistic'' about the new director's philosophy of community policing. But he said the city needs to recognize that its officers are low paid, ill-equipped and swamped with one of the highest volumes of emergency calls in the state. The officers carry emergency equipment made in the 1960's and drive patrol cars with an average of 103,000 miles on the odometer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cipriano said Trenton tried a community policing program nine years ago, but the city was strapped for money and ''that went out the window.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton said Trenton can make improvements without spending more money. Although he said it was too early to provide specific examples, he said many problems involve a ''prioritization of resources.''</p>
        <p>''In New York City that was done without any additional money for equipment, technology,'' he said. ''The only thing that went up in New York was personnel costs.''</p>
