        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to ''Ivy League Fever'': There are many private counselors who are very professional and ethical. Disturbing, however, is the attitude of some independent counselors and some parents that their involvement with the child should not be shared with the school counselor. What are these messages?</p>
        <p>The student is made to feel that he/she is doing something wrong, for why else is there a need for secrecy? Many students have a close, trusting relationship with the school counselor and are made to feel uncomfortable withholding this information. Another message for the student is that he/she is not capable of managing the college application process. What does this do to the student's sense of confidence?</p>
        <p>In addition, the prevalence of independent counselors in our area does foster a two-tier system of the haves and the have nots. More and more families are raising children with a sense of entitlement and with the message that one does not necessarily have to work hard at mastering a skill but instead someone can be hired to do anything. This is enabling behavior and children are learning to be dependent, not independent.</p>
        <p>Families in Westchester County are fortunate to be attending some of the finest schools in the country. In each high school there are trained, certified school counselors who are competent, knowledgeable and eager to help all of our students to continue their education past high school and to he able to set and reach obtainable goals.</p>
