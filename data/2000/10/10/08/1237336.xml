        <p>HAD a cameraman not been on hand when 12-year-old Muhammad al-Durrah and his father walked into a firefight last Saturday, the boy might just have been another faceless casualty. As it is, the image of Muhammad's death has become the latest totem in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Father and son had apparently found themselves in the midst of a skirmish between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers at Netzarim junction, the site of an Israeli army post and the setting for numerous confrontations over the years. Initially, Israeli army officials said that the bullets that killed Muhammad must have come from the Palestinian side. Later, the army took responsiblity, but suggested that both father and son had been part of the crowd throwing stones and Molotov cocktails. Mr. Al-Durrah and others have said that he and his son were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that the Israeli soldiers had targeted the boy as he tried to take cover behind his father. The Army flatly denied that charge and by week's end alleged that the Palestinian Authority was regularly offering money to parents who let their children join the conflict and perhaps become symbols themselves.</p>

        <p>Father and son had apparently found themselves in the midst of a skirmish between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers at Netzarim junction, the site of an Israeli army post and the setting for numerous confrontations over the years. Initially, Israeli army officials said that the bullets that killed Muhammad must have come from the Palestinian side. Later, the army took responsiblity, but suggested that both father and son had been part of the crowd throwing stones and Molotov cocktails. Mr. Al-Durrah and others have said that he and his son were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that the Israeli soldiers had targeted the boy as he tried to take cover behind his father. The Army flatly denied that charge and by week's end alleged that the Palestinian Authority was regularly offering money to parents who let their children join the conflict and perhaps become symbols themselves.</p>
        <p>From the start 13 years ago of the Palestinian uprisings known as the intifada through last Friday, more than 330 people under the age of 17 have been killed in fighting between the two sides, nine of them in the past week, according to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization. Most have been Palestinians in the occupied territories, but at least 18 were Israeli.</p>
        <p>The imbalance, of course, stems largely from the nature of the intifada itself. The central tactic was the organization of teenagers to confront and provoke armed soldiers by throwing rocks at them.</p>
        <p>Last week's fatalities included Mohammad Abu Assi, who was killed during another confrontation with Israeli security forces at Netzarim junction Wednesday night, five days after his 13th birthday, and Sarah Abdel Haq, 2, who was killed by gunfire -- her family said it was from Israelis -- on Sunday.</p>
        <p>An investigation into the shooting of Muhammad continues, but it was the unremarkable details of the boy's life -- he preferred soccer to schoolwork, enjoyed riding his bicycle and had a passion for cars -- that left so many Israelis and Palestinians stunned by his loss.</p>
