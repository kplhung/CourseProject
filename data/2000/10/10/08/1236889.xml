        <p>Q: Third world debt is not an inherently sexy issue. How did you find your way to it?</p>
        <p>U2 was involved in Live Aid, and I ended up going to Ethiopia and working there for some time with my wife, Ali. We were so high on the idea that Live Aid raised $200 million. And then you discover years later that that's what Africa is spending every few weeks servicing its debt. I thought we'd never forget what we'd been through in Ethiopia, but then those images just faded away. When this campaign for debt cancellation came up, I got interested again and I thought, O.K., there's 19,000 children dying every day. What are we arguing about here? That's a long answer to a short question, but I'm Irish, you'll have to forgive me.</p>

        <p>Q: Third world debt is not an inherently sexy issue. How did you find your way to it?</p>
        <p>U2 was involved in Live Aid, and I ended up going to Ethiopia and working there for some time with my wife, Ali. We were so high on the idea that Live Aid raised $200 million. And then you discover years later that that's what Africa is spending every few weeks servicing its debt. I thought we'd never forget what we'd been through in Ethiopia, but then those images just faded away. When this campaign for debt cancellation came up, I got interested again and I thought, O.K., there's 19,000 children dying every day. What are we arguing about here? That's a long answer to a short question, but I'm Irish, you'll have to forgive me.</p>
        <p>And you thought you could help because you're a celebrity?</p>
        <p>There are people much better qualified to do this than me. But as it happens, we live in this culture where people think pop stars and film stars are more important than nurses and firemen. I'm prepared to work with that. But I'm as skeptical as anyone would be about celebrities and causes -- and I will dare to say to you that I don't think of myself as a celebrity per se.</p>
        <p>Screaming fans everywhere you go -- that's the first hint you're a celebrity. How do you bone up on these issues?</p>
        <p>Sadly, I do my homework. I've a soft spot for the boring minutiae. I read the Charter of the United Nations before meeting with Kofi Annan. I read the Meltzer report, and then I'll read C. Fred Bergsten's defense of institutions like the World Bank and the I.M.F. It's embarrassing to admit. I'm aware that it's a lot more glamorous to be on the barricade with a handkerchief around your nose than it is to be at the meeting with a briefcase and a bowler hat, but I think that we're getting more done this way.</p>
        <p>O.K., you call James Wolfensohn, the head of the World Bank, and you say: ''This is Bono. I want to come talk to you about debt relief.'' What does he say -- Oh, good, Limp Bizkit was just finishing up a seminar on NAFTA''?</p>
        <p>I know a lot of these people are bemused at first. But I know the subject, sometimes better than they do. As it turns out, we had a very amusing meeting with Jim Wolfensohn because Bob Geldof was with me. We're no sooner in the door when Geldof is booming at him -- right from 1 to 11. At one point Jim, who started an early initiative calling for relief on a smaller scale, got out of the headlock and turned to me and said, ''So, you were knighted.'' And I'm going: ''No, no, I'm the good cop. That's Sir Bob Geldof.'' He was great, actually. With some of these people, I'm expecting to meet Satan, and they disappoint me.</p>
        <p>What was the first big step in your transformation?</p>
        <p>I've had an ongoing relationship with an economics professor at Harvard named Jeffrey Sachs. At the first meeting, I said, Is this achievable? I've not got flowers in my hair; I only want to be part of this if it's practical. Having a relationship with him is great, because if I'm having a meeting with Sandy Berger, and he's going, 'How much is this going to cost us?' I can say, 'I'll have the numbers for you in the morning, sir.' I've talked to people like Paul Volcker or Robert Rubin. When I met with Senator Jesse Helms, he wept. What exactly did you do to make Jesse Helms weep?</p>
        <p>I talked to him about the Biblical origin of the idea of Jubilee Year, the idea that every 49 years, you were supposed to release people from their debt and slaves were supposed to be set free. It's very punk rock for God, but I think it's in Leviticus. He was genuinely moved by the story of the continent of Africa, and he said to me, ''America needs to do more.'' I think he felt it as a burden on a spiritual level.</p>
        <p>And you met with the Pope too. He tried on your sunglasses, didn't he?</p>
        <p>The photos will never be seen, for fear of the T-shirts.</p>
        <p>What effect does your activism have on the band's public profile?</p>
        <p>It's difficult lately because we're trying to put out an album, and this stuff is very unhip. It's not a good look, and I kind of promised the band I'd stop doing these interviews last month, but we have this thing coming up in Congress -- a possible $435 million appropriation.</p>
        <p>I'm a singer, not a politician, and I think you don't want the two to get confused. It's not O.K. to be on CNN talking about people starving and then tell the interviewer that your new album is coming out in six months. And I don't want to be the singer who, when people think of you, they roll the blinds down, shouting, ''We've paid at the office.'' But God willing, next year we'll have got the money and I'll have got my record collection back in order.</p>
