        <p>WINTER, when crowds thin out, is a time for tranquillity in the national parks as well as reduced rates at lodges that remain open. But this winter may not be as serene as snowshoers, cross-country skiers and other visitors had hoped.</p>
        <p>Despite much publicity this year, snowmobiling will not be banned this winter. Even when new restrictions on snowmobiles are put forward (probably this month) and approved (probably for next winter), there are still likely to be 19 parks where they are allowed, most in Alaska.</p>
        <p>This winter, snowmobiling is legal in 41 national parks, national recreation areas and other places under Park Service jurisdiction. The new rule is expected to ban it from 11 parks, said Kym Hall, the Park Service regulations program manager.</p>
        <p>They are Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area in Montana and Wyoming; Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado; the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia; Cedar Breaks National Monument in Utah; Crater Lake National Park in Oregon; Curecanti National Recreation Area in Colorado; the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area; the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site in Iowa; Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park in Washington, and the Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota. In the Delaware Water Gap, it might be barred by the superintendent even before a national rule does so.</p>
        <p>Existing rules are expected to be revised in 11 other places; an environmental assessment, now going on, must be drafted for each place before rules are proposed. The places on this list are Acadia National Park in Maine; Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin; Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah; Grand Portage National Monument in Minnesota; North Cascades National Park and Lake Chelan and Ross Lake National Recreation Areas in Washington; Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan; Rocky Mountain National Park; St. Croix National Scenic Riverway in Wisconsin, and Zion National Park in Utah.</p>
        <p>Grand Teton and Yellowstone, which now admit snowmobiles on specific unplowed roads, are not on the list for the new regulation because they are developing a separate plan under a court order derived from an environmental group's lawsuit. The rules for the affected parks will all jibe in the end, Ms. Hall said.</p>
        <p>Outlook at Acadia</p>
        <p>At Acadia in Maine, which has not had a lot of snow in the last four years, according to the superintendent, Paul Haertel, there have been fewer than 400 visits by snowmobiles  in each of those winters, rangers estimated. In any case, Mr. Haertel said, he expected that the new rule would stop snowmobiling in the park by next winter.</p>
        <p>Cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are big attractions because they use the carriage roads, where motor vehicles are banned except for one link open to snowmobiles.</p>
        <p>With parks offering attractive wintertime deals, it's no surprise that there are so many visitors around to complain about snowmobiles. Blackwoods Campground, with a hand pump for water and chemical toilets, is open free from about Dec. 1 to April 1. There are no other accommodations in the park, but the area has many bed and breakfasts as well as motels in Ellsworth. Acadia: (207) 288-3338; www.nps.gov/acad.</p>
        <p>Bob Showler, the supervisory interpretive ranger at Zion National Park, said that the visitor centers stayed open all winter but that Zion had only 72,000 visitors last December in contrast with 376,000 in August. People come to hike and to look at the canyon walls.</p>
        <p>Zion Lodge, about two-thirds of the way from the south entrance toward the Temple of Sinawava at the north end, stays open all winter, offering reduced-rate packages. These are available Sunday through Thursday from Dec. 1 to March 14, except in  holiday periods. The rate is $65 for a standard room with breakfast for two; $75 for a cabin with fireplace, and $95 for a suite. Taxes and surcharges totaling about 10 percent and tips are not included. Zion Lodge: (303) 297-2757.</p>
        <p>Canyon de Chelly</p>
        <p>Thunderbird Lodge, a motel in the Canyon de Chelly National Monument near Chinle, Ariz., also offers winter rates. Canyon de Chelly (pronounced duh-SHAY), famous for red rock splits in the earth where the Anasazi lived between 350 and 1300,  is on the Navajo reservation.</p>
        <p>Winter daytime temperatures can be 20 to 30 degrees, but there is not a lot of snow, so sights remain accessible. Guides must lead any drives or hikes, other than the walk to White House, the best-known ruin.</p>
        <p>The lodge winter rates, in effect from Nov. 1 to March 31, are $58.50 for a single; $65 for a double, $71 for a triple and $77 for a quad. A suite is $90.50. Taxes of 8 percent are extra.</p>
        <p>Half-day tours of the canyon in six-wheel trucks with upholstered seats are offered by the lodge at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.; $39, and $30 ages 12 or under, plus 5.5 percent tax. Guides discuss the canyon's history and sacred places. Thunderbird Lodge: (520) 674-5841. Canyon de Chelly National Monument: (520) 674-5500.</p>
        <p>Yellowstone, in Wyoming, is a favorite among winter parkgoers. Two lodges, the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, have joined with the nonprofit Yellowstone Association Institute in a series of packages available from January through early March.</p>
        <p>Winter Wolf Discovery is new. It includes wildlife viewing in the Lamar Valley and talks about the reintroduction of wolves in the park. The package includes two nights in a room with bath at Mammoth Hot Springs; two breakfasts and lunches per person, and in-park transportation. Rates start at $215 a person, with two in a room, for Yellowstone Association members and $225 for nonmembers. Taxes of about $19 a person are extra.</p>
        <p>The Wonderland package is intended to be a broader introduction to the park: three nights in a room with bath at Mammoth Hot Springs and two nights at the Snow Lodge. Participants ride Yellowstone's  snowcoaches, cross-country ski and snowshoe to learn about wildlife and geology. Breakfasts and lunches are included. Prices start at $685 a person, double, for Yellowstone Association members, $695 for nonmembers. Taxes of about $43 a person are extra. Secret Snowscapes is basically a four-night version of the Wonderland plan. Yellowstone Lodges: (307) 344-5566. Yellowstone National Park: (307) 344-7381.</p>
        <p>The Lake Crescent Lodge in the Olympic National Park in Washington shuts after the last Sunday in October, except for its four Roosevelt Fireplace Cottages, which are open Friday, Saturday and Sunday ($76.60 a night in winter, with tax).</p>
        <p>The cottages have heat but no kitchens. A small refrigerator and a coffee maker are provided in winter. There is little snow, but the cottages may be quieter than even serenity seekers want. They are remote -- 22 miles west of Port Angeles on the Olympic Peninsula -- lacking in amenities and ''very simple,'' the reservationist said, a judgment that was confirmed by a friend who has been there. Nevertheless, they are  booked well in advance. Lake Crescent Lodge: (360) 928-3211.</p>
