        <p>John Nasuta blew a puff of steamy breath into the beam of his flashlight to gauge the wind direction, scanned the surrounding blackness and then stepped in a fresh saucer of cow manure. Domenic, his 7-year-old son, tittered.</p>
        <p>There was still half an hour before dawn and Mr. Nasuta was looking for a good downwind spot before daylight would give him away to even the most farsighted coyote. ''It's like hunting the bionic man,'' he said, his voice filled with awe. ''Their senses are so good, it's only a matter of seconds before they know you're there.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey's fourth coyote-hunting season started Sept. 30, and Mr. Nasuta was eager to make up for his dismal performance of last year, when 30 forays into the forest yielded plenty of sightings but no trophies. ''It's like the lottery,'' he said. ''Sooner or later, you're bound to get one.'</p>
        <p>This morning he was seeking one in a 15,000-acre state park near Vernon, in Sussex County on the New York border. The park has nature preserves for endangered wildlife but allows hunting in other areas.</p>
        <p>And in New Jersey's continuing war between man and beast, Mr. Nasuta stands on the front line. His mission, more than just love of sport, is to put a dent in a coyote population that he thinks has gotten out of hand. Since the first Eastern coyote was spotted near here in the 1950's, wildlife officials say, the German shepherd-sized predator has flourished in the state's fields and forested corridors.</p>
        <p>Wildlife officials estimate that there are 1,500 to 2,000 coyotes in the state and say they have been sighted in all 21 counties. The animal has succeeded because of its wariness, craftiness and willingness to eat just about anything. The officials also mention the state's 1987 ban on leg-hold traps, and they point out that the coyote's supply of food is plentiful, from road kill to rodents and the occasional backyard dog. Coyotes have been known to take down a newborn fawn and last year made meals of about a dozen sheep.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nasuta and a handful of other hunters say they fear that these highly skilled predators could do much more serious damage. ''One day, a coyote is going to jump onto someone's deck, grab their kid and run off,'' Mr. Nasuta said, as Domenic held tightly to his arm. ''It's only a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>No one has been killed in an encounter with a coyote in New Jersey, but a Hunterdon County woman fell and broke her leg last year as she tried to keep one from attacking her dog. She said the coyote tried to drag her by her coat collar until a neighbor chased it away.</p>
        <p>Across the state, the animals' increasingly common visits to inhabited areas are provoking alarm. A pack of coyotes that appeared on a Morris County soccer field two years ago caused school officials to postpone the game. Worried residents have been phoning in sightings to wildlife officers as the animals adapt more and more to living around people.</p>
        <p>''People call us saying, 'I thought these animals only lived out West,' '' said Bob Eriksen, supervising biologist with the State Division of Fish and Wildlife. ''I tell them, 'Not anymore.' '' Still, Mr. Eriksen and others say, there is no reason for alarm. ''Attacks on humans are very, very rare,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So far, the Eastern coyote and its Western cousin have managed to thrive despite the efforts to shoot, trap and poison them. ''They're slicker than you and I,'' said Jim Applegate, a professor of natural resources at Cook College in New Brunswick.</p>
        <p>''The wily coyote is not just a myth.''</p>
        <p>It certainly appears to be more wily than its better-armed enemies. Since New Jersey inaugurated a hunting season for coyote three years ago -- almost 2,000 people have spent $2.50 each for an annual coyote-hunting permit -- fewer than two dozen animals have been killed. The take has  been so dismal, state officials said, that they decided this year to eliminate the permit and to change the hunting season from one month, February, to October through December.</p>
        <p>''People got pretty discouraged sitting out there in the middle of February with nothing to show for it,'' said Larry Herrighty, chief of the State Bureau of Wildlife Management. ''I guess it takes a dedicated hunter to pursue a coyote.''</p>
        <p>Compared with the uproar over New Jersey's proposed bear hunt, which Gov. Christine Todd Whitman canceled last month after vehement protests by animal rights groups, the outcry over coyote hunting has been minimal. A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Animal Rights Alliance, Janine Motta, said her organization was not planning to protest the coyote-hunting season. ''Quite frankly, the general public is a bit apathetic when it comes to coyotes,'' she said. ''Lots of kids have teddy bears. Not too many kids grow up with little stuffed coyotes.''</p>
        <p>Nor are fears of disease a major concern, officials indicated.</p>
        <p>One of the staunchest defenders of the coyote is Stu Chaifetz, a Green Party candidate for Congress from Brick Township, in Ocean County. He fasted several times during the first three hunting seasons to publicize his opposition, but has decided to drop the practice. Besides what he considers the cruelty of the hunt, he says it is counterproductive to eliminate the only predator that is helping to reduce the state's growing deer population. ''It just doesn't make any sense,'' Mr. Chaifetz said. ''They're not bothering anyone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasuta couldn't disagree more. ''These animal rights freaks think they're dealing with Disney animals,'' he said. ''But what will they say to the parent of a kid who gets eaten by one of these things?''</p>
        <p>Declaring his hunting trip ''a religious holiday,'' he took the day off from his job as a carpenter, jostled Domenic awake at 2:30 a.m. and made the 90-minute drive from his home in suburban Garfield, in Bergen County, fortified with homemade pumpkin bread and armed with a bow and six arrows. (In the first six weeks of the season, no guns are allowed.) Mr. Nasuta, 45, took along an impressive array of calling devices and foam decoys, among them three turkeys and a spotted fawn.</p>
        <p>As daylight started coloring the sky and the fog began to lift, he sprayed a cloud of fox urine (to mask the human scent) and hunched at the base of a giant oak tree. He and Domenic then began setting off a chorus of clucking and gobbling turkey calls as the dummy birds, set on metal poles, bobbed in the breeze. Suddenly there was a hair-raising coyote wail from just yards away.</p>
        <p>An impressionable observer, stationed at a nearby tree, was left breathless. A few moments later, the sounds subsided. The quarry never appeared.</p>
        <p>After sitting motionless for 15 minutes, Mr. Nasuta removed the face netting he uses for concealment and stood up to stretch. What happened to the coyote? the unschooled tag-along asked. The howling, he was told, was simply a taped recording from a cassette player Mr. Nasuta carried.</p>
        <p>All morning, the father-son hunting party moved along the ridge using an assortment of prerecorded calls: the classic pack of yelping coyotes, the heart-rending cry of an orphaned fawn and the whimpering squeaks of a wounded hare. The coyotes were not fooled.</p>
        <p>As they tramped through the woods empty-handed, Domenic, in the time-honored tradition of the outfoxed hunter, looked up at his father and suggested a way out of the ignominy. ''Let's tell Mom that we got a coyote,'' he said. ''But after we got it, we'll say, a bear came along and ran off with it.''</p>
