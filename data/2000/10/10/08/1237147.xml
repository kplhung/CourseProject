        <p>HAS the Internet made the often-predicted revolution in mutual fund marketing -- the death of the salesman -- dawn at last?</p>
        <p>For much of the 76-year history of the fund business, the accepted view was that funds were sold, not bought. Relatively few potential customers were familiar with funds or found in them much in the way of either cocktail-party conversation or investment promise. So brokers would have to sell them, and the idea of them, to investors, and be paid a commission, or sales load, for doing so.</p>
        <p>That began to change in the 1980's, when investing in general and mutual funds in particular became a popular preoccupation. Investors took the initiative, the demand skyrocketed and the funds seemed to sell themselves. The future, many people said, would belong to the no-load fund, as investors realized that they could avoid costly sales charges.</p>
        <p>But while the no-load concept may have won the intellectual battle, it has yet to conquer the world. Intermediaries still sell about two-thirds of fund shares; in fact, that proportion is up slightly from a decade ago.</p>
        <p>The Internet is opening a new battle front against sales loads. The kind of in-depth fund information that investors once could receive only from brokers is now readily available online -- and usually free. Many fund families allow investors to switch money among funds over the Internet. And in recent months, a handful of funds normally available only with sales charges have begun to take orders to buy or sell shares online with little or no sales charge.</p>
        <p>So should the tens of thousands of people who make handsome livings recommending and selling fund shares start looking for another line of work? Maybe not just yet.</p>
        <p>Because there are now so many funds available -- 5,000 equity funds alone -- overwhelmed investors will still turn to brokers and financial planners for help.</p>
        <p>''We fully expect intermediaries to strongly dominate'' the business well into the future, said Steve Cummings, an analyst for the Financial Research Corporation, a financial services consultant in Boston. He expects direct sales of fund shares, either online or through the mail, to decline to 20 percent of transactions by 2005.</p>
        <p>According to Burt Greenwald, a longtime fund official who now has his own consulting firm in Philadelphia, the role of the intermediary is not shrinking, just changing. ''It used to be that he was the presumed fount of all knowledge'' about investments, someone to whom an investor would essentially turn over his money, Mr. Greenwald said. ''But that's no longer the case.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the sales representative or planner has become an adviser, someone who can help sort through the myriad of boasts, goals, annual fees, tax strategies and other factors in choosing funds. ''Information is so widely available, it's suffocating investors,'' including the knowledgeable ones who want to remain in control of their financial assets, Mr. Greenwald said. ''The advice function has taken over.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Internet's impact on mutual funds is growing. Investors now routinely log on to reinvest dividends, to read prospectuses and reports, and to download purchase forms that they print out and mail in with a check. Intermediaries like E*Trade and Charles Schwab operate online ''supermarkets'' where their customers can buy any of hundreds of funds.</p>
        <p>And the federal law permitting electronic ''signatures,'' which took effect last week, has opened the door for fund companies to make it as easy to buy fund shares online as it is to buy stocks.</p>
        <p>Among the first of the direct online fund sellers was General Electric, which said in February that it would offer shares in its 21 G.E. Funds on the Internet, and waive the 5.75 percent load charged when shares were bought through intermediaries. (The funds, originally sold only to G.E. employees, were opened to public investors in the 1990's.) The funds were advertised nationally for the first time during the Olympic Games on NBC, a G.E. subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Tim Benedict, a spokesman for G.E.'s fund unit, summed up a fundamental marketing shift toward nontraditional channels, including fee-based planners, wrap programs and 401(k) plans, that occurred during the last decade.</p>
        <p>''It used to be load versus no-load,'' he said. ''Now it's advice versus no-advice.''</p>
        <p>The Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup is also exploring the frontiers of fund marketing. Its AssetOne money management program offers more than 1,500 load and load-waived funds that, beginning on Oct. 15, can be bought online as well as through sales representatives. In May, a rule restricting mutual funds to 30 percent of an AssetOne portfolio was scrapped; now there is no limit.</p>
        <p>''More and more clients want to buy and sell funds, and instead of a commission they'd rather pay a fee,'' said Pam Parker, the program's director.</p>
        <p>AssetOne accounts, which require a $50,000 minimum, are charged a flat fee on an annual basis, based on the size of the account, starting at 1 percent of assets for the first $1 million and declining for larger amounts.</p>
        <p>Strong Investments, a Milwaukee-based sponsor of no-load funds, is moving in another direction by creating a new group of funds for distribution through planners and other third-party advisers who will charge for their services. Strong hopes to start the new funds next month.</p>
        <p>AT the same time, Strong is developing a way to sell its no-load funds directly on the Internet to consumers with whom it has no previous tie. Brian Melter, the company's manager for e-commerce, said bank-account verification would be ''almost instantaneous'' now that the new electronic signature law is in effect, overcoming an obstacle to same-day purchases.</p>
        <p>This new sales avenue is ''a definite turning point'' in fund evolution, Mr. Melter said, as more investors, especially middle-income people unable to afford expensive consultants, are nonetheless willing to pay for basic guidance.</p>
        <p>David G. Dietze, president of Point View Financial Services in Summit, N.J., agreed with the premise. ''There's a lot of discretionary income out there,'' he said, and these middle-income investors will pay for help in picking a mutual fund, even if their accounts are not of the size to interest a financial planner.</p>
        <p>Over all, then, the two sales channels of mutual funds are converging, with the load funds offering no-load clones and the no-load funds selling more shares through intermediaries.</p>
        <p>Peter A. Harbeck, president of SunAmerica Asset Management, echoed the attitudes of many load-fund operators when he said his company was not eager to help investors bypass traditional sales channels, including Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber. ''We strongly believe that people need and desire help,'' Mr. Harbeck said. Transactions made easy by the Internet may eventually take hold, he said, ''but the key thing is knowing what to buy.''</p>
