        <p>LAST month, Jeffrey C. Hines shoveled some dirt in Seattle. He did the same the month before in San Francisco, and next month he'll do some digging in Guadalajara, Mexico. After a string of sluggish years in the wake of the real estate crash of the mid-1980's, groundbreakings are again routine for Mr. Hines, the president of Hines Interests L.P. in Houston.</p>
        <p>''We're keeping busy,'' said Mr. Hines, who after a decade of grooming took over day-to-day operations of the 33-year-old real estate firm in 1990, when his father, Gerald D. Hines, its  founder, assumed the title of chairman. And now that the father, who is 75, has moved to London to lead the company's international projects, the son, 44, is making his own mark.</p>
        <p>Gerald Hines is known for his conceptual and aesthetic skills -- he visualized trophy skyscrapers where others saw nothing but cow pasture. But Jeffrey, serious-minded and soft-spoken, is strongest in finance. ''He's a numbers guy,'' said Marc J. Shapiro, vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, which has longstanding ties to Hines as both tenant and lender.</p>
        <p>In addition to his ability to play tournament-level bridge -- and to tick off the batting average of just about every player in Major League Baseball -- Jeffrey Hines knows how to finance deals. During his tenure, the company has raised $6 billion to acquire and develop properties in the United States and abroad.</p>
        <p>Typical is a $410 million fund formed in 1996 with the Trust Company of the West Group and Dean Witter Realty for projects in emerging markets like Brazil, Poland, Russia and China. There are also financing partnerships with the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the giant pension fund known as Calpers, and with General Motors Asset Management. ''We used to raise money one project at a time,'' said Mr. Hines, who attended Williams College and Harvard Business School.</p>
        <p>Under his father, the company seldom if ever sold or acquired buildings. Perhaps that was because Gerald Hines had a reputation for developing landmarks that helped to define the skylines of Houston, San Francisco, Detroit and New York. ''Dad saw buying as a negative,'' Mr. Hines said. ''He was into building, not rehabbing.''</p>
        <p>His father hired, and notably kept on budget, architects like Cesar Pelli, I. M. Pei and Philip Johnson to build the eye-catching properties that make up the company's 190 million-square-foot portfolio.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Hines appreciates attractive architecture, but he is more swayed by the bottom line. ''You have to look at the realities of the market,'' he said, and if the numbers indicate, ''you get over any attachment you might have to a property.'' Such was the case with Houston's Galleria shopping complex, complete with indoor ice rink, which Hines shed in 1999.</p>
        <p>Louis B. Cushman, chief executive of Cushman Realty in Houston, who knows both father and son, said, ''Jeff Hines has helped take the business in new directions now that the days of building so-called edifice complexes or corporate monuments are over.''</p>
        <p>New projects pay more attention to the interior environment. ''Tenants are wanting more low-rise office campuses that have a more casual and open feel,'' Jeffrey Hines explained.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cushman also noted the many projects that Hines had undertaken as a third-party developer, including the Audrey Jones Beck Building of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and the Boston Red Sox spring training ballpark in Fort Myers, Fla. ''After the market turned in the 80's, it was clear we had to make some changes,'' Jeffrey Hines said. ''It isn't possible to be just a developer in the traditional sense anymore.''</p>
        <p>That does not mean that Hines has abandoned traditional development. It has several projects under way in the United States and Latin America, but the push is overseas. Using cash from several funds that his son has amassed, Gerald Hines is directing large undertakings like Diagonal Mar, a $600 million, 84-acre project in Barcelona, Spain, that will include retail, office and residential space as well as a resort and public park.</p>
        <p>Other large-scale developments include office and residential complexes in Germany, the Czech Republic, France, Poland, Russia and China. ''Hines Interests is way out in front in the international arena,'' said William C. Wheaton, professor of economics and director of the Center for Real Estate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Hines said the decision to go global was, again, based on the numbers. ''We saw high rental rates and high return and little or no competition,'' he said. And domestic Hines tenants had complained about not being able to find office space and housing as they expanded abroad.</p>
        <p>GIVEN the opportunity to again build striking new properties, Gerald Hines moved to London with his wife and teenage children in 1995. Divorced from Jeffrey's mother, he remarried 19 years ago, around the time his son married. As a result, Jeffrey Hines's four children have an aunt and uncle who are their contemporaries. ''It makes things interesting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cushman said he thought the absence of Gerald Hines had made it easier for the son ''to fill some pretty big shoes.'' When not trying to live up to the industry's high expectations, Jeffrey might be found playing cards with his family -- just as he once played cards with his father. A self-described ''sports nut,'' he also loves fantasy baseball.</p>
        <p>''It's all numbers,'' he said, ''a great way to learn probability, risk and reward.''</p>
