        <p>The MetroStars' turnaround from worst in the league to a goal away from reaching the championship game of Major League Soccer can be attributed to the attitude and efforts of players and the team's new management.</p>
        <p>A disputed goal with two minutes left Friday night sent the visiting MetroStars to a 3-2 defeat against the Chicago Fire in the third and final game of their playoff semifinal. In next Sunday's M.L.S. Cup 2000 in Washington, Chicago will meet the Kansas City Wizards, who defeated the Los Angeles Galaxy in the semifinals.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, meanwhile, will leave on Oct. 22 for two exhibition games in Germany and Austria. They will return Nov. 1 and start planning for next season.</p>
        <p>Lothar Matthaus will be the MetroStars' marquee attraction in Europe, but whether he returns is one of the team's biggest questions. Matthaus, a 39-year-old German superstar, is considering several options.</p>
        <p>Matthaus was partly responsible for the MetroStars' remarkable turnaround from a record of 7-25 last year to an Eastern Division title and a record of 17-12-3 this season. General Manager Nick Sakiewicz said yesterday from Chicago that he would meet with Matthaus after the exhibition tour. ''I will see where his head is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sakiewicz said he would sit down and evaluate each player. His priority, however, is the MetroStars' plan to build a stadium exclusively for soccer.</p>
        <p>''The next 30 days, the stadium project will step into final gear,'' Sakiewicz said.</p>
        <p>He and Coach Octavio Zambrano, who joined the team after last season, have been given most of the credit for the team's turnaround. They, in turn, are giving all the credit to the players.</p>
        <p>The rest of the 12-team league recognized the efforts of the MetroStars this season.</p>
        <p>Zambrano is a finalist for coach of the year, and Sakiewicz, last year's executive of the year with Tampa Bay, is again a finalist for that award.</p>
        <p>''What this means is that people who follow the sport closely are giving us credit for what we've done,'' Zambrano said.</p>
        <p>On the players' side, Clint Mathis, perhaps the one most responsible for the MetroStars' success in the regular season, is one of three finalists for the most valuable player award, while Tab Ramos is a finalist for comeback player of the year.</p>
        <p>Mathis finished second in the league in scoring, behind Tampa Bay's Mamadou Diallo, with 46 points; he had 16 goals and 14 assists. He also set a league record by scoring five goals in a game against Dallas. Ramos had his best season and could play a key role on the United States national team in the World Cup qualifying game against Costa Rica on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Sakiewicz said everyone on the team would trade individual honors for the championship trophy. Zambrano said he believed the MetroStars would be playing for the trophy if a couple of calls had gone in their favor Friday night.</p>
        <p>Zambrano and goalkeeper Mike Ammann said they thought Ante Razov had scored the winning goal from an offside position in the 88th minute. The disputed play came after the referee disallowed a goal by Adolfo Valencia, who had scored both MetroStars goals, ruling that he was offside. The call infuriated Ammann, who said, ''We had a clear goal taken away from us.''</p>
