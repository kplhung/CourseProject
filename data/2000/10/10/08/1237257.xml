        <p>Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore are presenting voters with perhaps the starkest choice in decades over the kind of people they would select as judges for the federal bench, according to legal analysts and several of the candidates' closest advisers.</p>
        <p>The presidential candidates themselves demonstrated as much in Tuesday night's debate as they clashed sharply over the judicial philosophy they would seek in the candidates they would appoint to the Supreme Court. And this election also comes at a time when not only the Supreme Court but also many of the nation's appellate courts are finely balanced ideologically.</p>
        <p>How the federal bench is shaped in the next four or eight years, scholars say, could have a profound effect on such issues as the extent of federal power in relation to the states, the constitutionality of affirmative action programs, the lengths to which the government may go in aiding parochial school students and how much states may be permitted to limit abortion rights.</p>
        <p>''In a sense, this is the single biggest issue before the country in this election in terms of differences between the two candidates,'' said William E. Leuchtenberg, a history professor at the University of North Carolina. ''Here you have two candidates who are in a number of other respects fighting for the center, but in this issue their points of views are sharply defined, with Bush certain to name conservatives to the bench and Gore prepared to choose more liberal judges.''</p>
        <p>Terry Eastland, a senior Justice Department official in the Reagan administration and a court analyst, said that while changes on the Supreme Court were probable, given the ages and health of some of the justices, they were far from certain, especially over the next four-year presidential term. But Mr. Eastland said there was little doubt that the next president would have a large role in shaping the nation's 13 circuit courts of appeal, the level just below the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''Whoever is elected will necessarily have the opportunity to alter the direction at the level of the federal courts of appeal and may well also have the opportunity at the Supreme Court level,'' Mr. Eastland said.</p>
        <p>And as the Supreme Court agrees to decide ever fewer cases each year, the appeals courts have taken on greater importance as their rulings often remain the law of the land.</p>
        <p>Professor Leuchtenberg said that with respect to judicial appointments, ''this is probably the most critical moment in the history of the judiciary since F.D.R.'s second term.'' President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Supreme Court appointments, which began in his second term, were crucial in validating the notion that the federal government could regulate the national economy, the underpinning of the New Deal.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the issue of court appointments has had little effect in modern presidential elections. Yet each side has a small but highly motivated constituency on this issue, and Governor Bush, of Texas, and Vice President Gore have given unmistakable signals, as they did Tuesday night, to those groups as to how they would pick judicial nominees.</p>
        <p>While it is clear, for example, that each candidate would try to name judges who agree with his view on abortion, each insisted in the debate that he would not impose any ''litmus test.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the candidates have left little doubt in the messages they are sending to their supporters. Governor Bush discovered in the primary season that indirect assurances that he would name only reliable conservatives were not sufficient. That was because the influential group of Republicans eagerly hoping to gain control of the White House and the nominating procedure has adopted ''No More Souters'' as its private slogan, one G.O.P. adviser said.</p>
        <p>The reference is to Justice David H. Souter, who has proved to be emblematic to conservatives of disappointment and even ideological betrayal. Justice Souter was nominated by President George Bush in 1990 with assurances to conservatives that despite his meager record as a federal appeals court judge, he would prove a reliable member of the court's conservative coalition. Instead, he has often voted with the court's liberal bloc.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush, after meeting with his advisers, decided to offer an explicit and hard-to-mistake signal and said that the justices he most admired were Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are widely viewed as the court's two most resolute conservatives and reliable foes of court rulings extending abortion rights.</p>
        <p>''The voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench, people who will strictly interpret the Constitution and will not use the bench to write social policy,'' Governor Bush said Tuesday night. ''I don't believe in liberal, activist judges; I believe in strict constructionists, and those are the kind of judges I will appoint.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore responded: ''In my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with the -- with our country and our history. I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment. And when the phrase 'strict constructionist' is used, and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying that the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade,'' the 1973 ruling that first found a constitutional right to abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said his appointees would ''have a philosophy that I think would make it quite likely'' that they would uphold the Roe decision.</p>
        <p>One factor that could alter all the speculation of how either candidate would select judges as president is the eventual political makeup of the Senate, which screens the nominees through the confirmation process. The kind of people a president nominates for the bench often depends on whether the Senate is controlled by his party or the opposition and by how much.</p>
        <p>One Bush adviser said that to deal with the ''no more Souters'' issue, a new Republican administration would try to choose candidates with established records on the major issues. Lawyers who are advising Governor Bush said in interviews that his most likely models for appointing judges were his father, President Bush, and President Ronald Reagan, both of whom turned the process over to a group of committed conservatives.</p>
        <p>It is far less clear that Mr. Gore would closely follow President Clinton's approach in choosing judges. Mr. Clinton generally chose lawyers with moderate philosophical leanings and did not try to provide a counterweight to the previous 12 years in which Republicans sought to turn the courts rightward.</p>
        <p>Many liberal advocacy groups are hopeful that Mr. Gore would be bolder than Mr. Clinton in his court choices.</p>
        <p>How the Supreme Court might change after the election depends not only on who wins but also on two other even more speculative issues: who, if any, of the current justices might retire and who the new president would choose to replace them.</p>
        <p>The speculation as to retirements has focused largely on the three oldest members of the court, Justice John Paul Stevens, who is 80, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who turned 76 last Sunday, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 70. All three were named to the court by Republican presidents, but they have assumed markedly different ideological roles.</p>
        <p>The chief justice is the most reliably conservative of the trio, with Justice Stevens voting often with the liberal bloc and Justice O'Connor a conservative who sometimes votes with the liberal bloc.</p>
        <p>David A. Yalof, a political scientist at the University of Connecticut who has studied the Supreme Court appointment process, said that decisions on retirement might depend on who is in the White House.</p>
        <p>''For example, if Gore won, it's possible Rehnquist might try to hang on,'' he said. ''Whereas he might be inclined to leave and turn over the process of choosing his successor to Bush.''</p>
        <p>Professor Yalof noted that ''not every president gets the chance to choose a Supreme Court justice, especially in the first four years.''</p>
        <p>One thing the guess lists of both candidates have in common is the presence of Hispanic candidates, as it is generally believed that both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore would like to reap the credit for naming the first Hispanic member of the court.</p>
        <p>On the Democratic side, the potential Hispanic candidates include Judge Jose A. Cabranes, 59, a federal appeals court judge in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Other possible Hispanic nominees for a Gore White House would be Judge Fortunato P. Benavides, 53, a federal appeals court judge in Austin, Tex., and Judge Sonia Sotomayor, 46, a federal appeals court judge in New York.</p>
        <p>Other possible Supreme Court nominees in a Gore administration include two members of the appeals court in Washington, Judge David S.  Tatel, 58, and Judge Merrick B. Garland, 47. Another leading candidate would be Walter E. Dellinger, 59, a former solicitor general and constitutional scholar.</p>
        <p>Three other federal appeals court judges who might be considered are Diane P. Wood, 50, in Chicago, Martha Craig Daughtrey, 57, in Nashville, and Mary Margaret McKeown, 49, in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Lawyers close to Governor Bush say their leading Hispanic candidate would be Emilio M. Garza, 53, an appeals court judge in San Antonio.</p>
        <p>But the two most prominently talked-about candidates are judges on the appeals court based in Richmond, Va. Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, 56, who sits in Charlottesville, and J. Michael Luttig, 46, who sits in Alexandria, are conservative jurists who have written bold opinions limiting federal power.</p>
        <p>Another favorite with the conservative lawyers who would be influential in a Bush administration is Judge Jerry E. Smith, 53, a federal appeals court judge in Houston. Other candidates include Judge Edith H. Jones, 51, who sits on the same court as Judge Smith, and Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, 52, an appeals court judge in Chicago who is a leading judicial exponent of the so-called law and economics school.</p>
        <p>On the current court, a shift of one or two votes on some issues could have profound consequences. For example, the court's five most conservative members, Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia, O'Connor,  Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy have formed a bloc to curtail federal power over the states.</p>
        <p>Another issue that roughly divides 5 to 4 is racial preference in hiring and education, although Justice O'Connor is regarded as a crucial swing vote. A one-vote shift could put the justices more clearly behind affirmative action programs or put the programs out of business.</p>
        <p>Abortion rights advocates and Mr. Gore have asserted that the court is one vote away from sharply curtailing the right to an abortion, though that is probably an exaggeration. There are only three solid votes on the court to overturn Roe: Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas. Justice Kennedy has usually sided with the liberal bloc and Justice O'Connor to form a 6-to-3 majority that is generally in favor of abortion rights. Justice Kennedy sided, however, with the conservative minority in last term's 5-to-4 ruling striking down a Nebraska law outlawing a form of late-term abortion.</p>
