        <p>Colonial Symphony's season opener will feature violin solo by Sheryl Staples, conducted by Yehuda Gilad, who was instrumental in introducing Staples to her future husband, timpanist Barry Centanni; photo (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>By profession, Yehuda Gilad is a conductor, not a marriage-maker. But the Colonial Symphony's Morristown season opens with a little evidence that Mr. Gilad is both. When Sheryl Staples, Saturday's soloist in the Beethoven Violin Concerto, came from Los Angeles four years ago to perform with the orchestra, its timpanist, Barry Centanni, was smitten. As casually as he could, he asked Mr. Gilad about Ms. Staples' life out west, and about her, er, husband. Learning from Mr. Gilad that she was, in fact, single, he managed to wait till the second rehearsal to approach her.  Cut to the chase -- or to last April's wedding cake.</p>
        <p>The longer version of this romance is that since the couple, who now live in Bloomfield, met,Ms. Staples has become principal associate concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic, and was a soloist in its recent Mendelssohn festival.</p>

        <p>By profession, Yehuda Gilad is a conductor, not a marriage-maker. But the Colonial Symphony's Morristown season opens with a little evidence that Mr. Gilad is both. When Sheryl Staples, Saturday's soloist in the Beethoven Violin Concerto, came from Los Angeles four years ago to perform with the orchestra, its timpanist, Barry Centanni, was smitten. As casually as he could, he asked Mr. Gilad about Ms. Staples' life out west, and about her, er, husband. Learning from Mr. Gilad that she was, in fact, single, he managed to wait till the second rehearsal to approach her.  Cut to the chase -- or to last April's wedding cake.</p>
        <p>The longer version of this romance is that since the couple, who now live in Bloomfield, met,Ms. Staples has become principal associate concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic, and was a soloist in its recent Mendelssohn festival.</p>
        <p>Last fall, James R. Oestreich, writing in The New York Times, found it hard to believe that Ms. Staples was responsible for improving the whole violin section, but conceded that ''the coincidence of timing is uncanny, and there Ms. Staples was.''</p>
        <p>The Community Theater concert, for which Mr. Gilad goes back to his conducting hat, so to speak, begins with a pre-concert talk by Martin Bookspan and the premiere of  ''Lament,'' a memorial movement by David Sampson, a Morristown resident. It is pure coincidence that the evening is called ''Heartstrings.''  Isn't it?</p>
