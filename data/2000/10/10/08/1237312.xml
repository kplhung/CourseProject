        <p>UNLESS the Yankees win tonight's decisive fifth game at Oakland to salvage their American League division series, they will be branded as having suffered the most colossal collapse in baseball history.</p>
        <p>Including last night's 11-1 defeat at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees have lost 17 of their last 22, and eight straight before winning the second and third games of this three-of-five-game series.</p>
        <p>When the Yankees wobbled through late September, they didn't back into their first-place finish in the A.L. East so much as they toppled backward into it. And now they are threatening to upstage the 1964 Philadelphia Phillies as baseball's most famous failures, possibly for the same reason: using starters on less than their usual rest.</p>
        <p>Working on three days' rest instead of four, Roger Clemens was pounded in last night's loss. Andy Pettitte will be tonight's starter, again on only three days' rest.</p>
        <p>''I can't worry about it because he's my starter,'' Joe Torre, the Yankee manager, said, alluding to Pettitte. ''We made that decision. You make your committment and you go for it.''</p>
        <p>The 1964 Phillies held a six-and-a-half-game lead with only 12 games left before losing 10 straight games as the St. Louis Cardinals, with the right-hander Bob Gibson and third baseman Ken Boyer, rallied to win that National League pennant in a four-team race that also included the Cincinnati Reds and the San Francisco Giants.</p>
        <p>During that losing streak, Gene Mauch, the Phillies' manager, was so desperate, he twice started each of his two most dependable pitchers, the right-hander Jim Bunning and the left-hander Chris Short, with two days' rest instead of their usual three days' rest. The Phillies lost all four.</p>
        <p>Torre has risked making the same mistake. Unable to trust Denny Neagle as his fourth starter, Torre came back with Clemens last night on only three days' rest. Now he must wonder if Pettitte, who combined with Mariano Rivera for a 4-0 shutout in Wednesday's second game, can be effective.</p>
        <p>After opening a seven-game homestand at Connie Mack Stadium with three losses to the Reds, the Phillies lost four to the Milwaukee Braves. Torre, then the Braves' 24-year-old catcher, drove in a total of 7 runs with 11 hits, including 2 homers and 2 triples.</p>
        <p>''Everything the Phillies did turned out wrong,'' Torre recalled. ''I remember one of the Phillies hit a ground ball to our third baseman, Eddie Mathews, who faked a throw to first base, then turned and tagged out the Phillies' runner at third who had wandered off the bag.''</p>
        <p>As the final week of that season began, the Reds were in first place after a nine-game winning streak. The Cardinals, sweeping three from the Phillies in St. Louis, surged to the pennant on the final Sunday with an 11-5 victory over the Mets as Tim McCarver caught a foul pop for the final out.</p>
        <p>''Whenever a good team goes into a tailspin late in the season,'' McCarver, now a Yankees broadcaster, said of that 1964 pennant race, ''I remember how those Phillies collapsed and how we came on to win.''</p>
        <p>The Phillies won their last two games in Cincinnati to salvage some of their pride, and when the Phillies' chartered jet rolled up to the gate at the Philadelphia airport that Sunday night, Mauch took the intercom.</p>
        <p>''I want to be the first one off,'' the Phillies' manager told his players. ''You guys didn't lose it. I did.''</p>
        <p>Through the years, other first-place teams have blown a big lead only to lose the pennant or a division title in a race that went down to the final days of the season, if not in a playoff.</p>
        <p>But two of those teams, the 1951 Brooklyn Dodgers and the 1978 Boston Red Sox (managed by Don Zimmer, now a Yankee coach), didn't play nearly as poorly at the end as these Yankees.</p>
        <p>The 1951 Dodgers didn't blow the pennant as much as the 1951 Giants snatched it with a 37-7 finish. After being 13 1/2 games ahead in mid-August, the Dodgers were a respectable 26-22, including two theatrical victories on the final weekend in Philadelphia as Don Newcombe outpitched Robin Roberts, 5-0, and Jackie Robinson hit a 14th-inning home run for a 9-8 triumph.</p>
        <p>In their N.L. pennant playoff, the Giants won the decisive third game, 5-4, on Bobby Thomson's three-run ninth-inning homer off Ralph Branca at the Polo Grounds -- arguably baseball's most memorable single moment.</p>
        <p>The 1978 Red Sox, after having been 14 games ahead of the Yankees on July 19, skidded into second place that September, but won their last eight games, forcing a one-game playoff that the Yankees won when Bucky Dent lofted a three-run homer off Mike Torrez into the net atop Fenway Park's left-field wall.</p>
        <p>The 1969 Cubs, who were nine and a half games ahead in mid-August and still five ahead with only 25 games remaining, lost 7 straight, 10 of 11, and 14 of 20 as the Mets streaked past them to win the N.L. East by 8 games.</p>
        <p>Oddly, the Phillies' phlop, coupled with the Cardinals' winning the pennant, affected Yankee history. When the Phillies appeared almost certain to win the pennant in what was then a 10-team league, the Cardinals' beer-baron owner, the late Gussie Busch, quietly decided to fire Johnny Keane and hire Leo Durocher, then a coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers, as the Cardinal manager for 1965.</p>
        <p>When the Cardinals won the pennant and then conquered the Yankees in the World Series, Yogi Berra was inexplicably fired as the Yankee manager, and Keane, who knew of Busch's plan, left the Cardinals and joined the Yankees as Berra's surprise successor.</p>
        <p>But more than anything else, 1964 is remembered in baseball for how the Phillies blew the pennant they apparently had so wrapped up with two weeks remaining that they were selling World Series tickets. And now the Yankees may replace those 1964 Phillies in the most negative niche in baseball history.</p>
