        <p>CONTACT, or the hope of contact, was the operative notion when Simon Rattle conducted Duke Ellington at Carnegie Hall recently: two forces rushing toward each other, giddy with the prospect of embrace. Contact, real or imagined, existed on so many levels that there is hardly room to list them.</p>
        <p>Certainly, sheer sound for its own sake was at the top. First came the symphonic luxury of Luther Henderson's Ellington arrangements: soft strings and horns saying hello to Ellington's brilliantly strident brass choruses. Second were the players themselves, as members of the Orchestra of St. Luke's wore broad grins and bobbed heads to the beat, scarcely believing this momentary liberation from the customary sobriety of their work.</p>

        <p>CONTACT, or the hope of contact, was the operative notion when Simon Rattle conducted Duke Ellington at Carnegie Hall recently: two forces rushing toward each other, giddy with the prospect of embrace. Contact, real or imagined, existed on so many levels that there is hardly room to list them.</p>
        <p>Certainly, sheer sound for its own sake was at the top. First came the symphonic luxury of Luther Henderson's Ellington arrangements: soft strings and horns saying hello to Ellington's brilliantly strident brass choruses. Second were the players themselves, as members of the Orchestra of St. Luke's wore broad grins and bobbed heads to the beat, scarcely believing this momentary liberation from the customary sobriety of their work.</p>
        <p>The contingent of jazz soloists, a distinguished group, seemed highly pleased to be playing in such a mecca of European culture and taking part in the regimented doings of classical music. Audiences at first didn't know whether to applaud during the music or not, but gradually decided they would. Less easy to reconcile was conservatory stiffness trying to cope with the sophisticated looseness of jazz's rhythm and meter. The jazz players seemed equally uncomfortable with European foursquareness.</p>
        <p>Here were two cultural forces in so many ways having nothing to do with each other that one wondered why they were trying in the first place. Certainly, jazz, as a self-contained art form, has no further aspiration than self-improvement. The old idea of music as a pyramid, with classical music at the top, has largely gone away, but there was at this event at least a hint of the old ways.</p>
        <p>Maybe this was why Sir Simon's between-numbers patter seemed so nervous and contrived. His respect for this music, and his credible execution of it, were genuine, but this was a man not on his own ground and knowing it. The evening kept tiptoeing away from any suggestion that a lower art form was trying to assimilate as a higher one showed its broad-mindedness by mixing with lower orders. In the process, everyone protested a bit too much.</p>
        <p>Ellington, of course, had classical-music aspirations of his own, as his two set pieces played after intermission demonstrate. ''Harlem'' and the ''Far East Suite'' take some nasty bites out of concert formality, and they at least avoid the general sappiness of Mr. Henderson's other symphonic arrangements. Here, however, is Ellington himself on foreign territory, trying through some sort of inner or outward obligation to succeed at someone else's game. Both pieces leave me restless and unsatisfied.</p>
        <p>Anyone who went to Carnegie Hall looking for cultural contact should have known the game was up 10 minutes into the evening. ''Take the A Train'' traded brilliant blasts of music from 10 jazz soloists with delicate oboe solos from within the orchestra. The two contingents might just as well have been in different cities. The development of jazz-band sonorities like Ellington's grew from earlier musicians operating in less than ideal conditions and needing ways to command attention. Oboes and violins were nurtured in tamer, quieter concert-hall environments.</p>
        <p>The extraordinary subtlety of Clark Terry's fluegelhorn solos shared some of the timbre of the St. Luke's French horns, but French horns and the culture they represent spoke a different language in a different accent and a different sense of rhythm. Dianne Reeves, a sensuous vocalist, and Regina Carter, a highly entertaining violinist, both used electronic amplification, another jarring discord in this proposed union.</p>
        <p>Taken piecemeal, a lot of the concert was irresistible. Besides Mr. Terry, there were Wycliffe Gordon's explosive trombone playing and Bobby Watson's aggressive alto saxophone. Joe Lovano's tenor sax played delicious and delicate obbligatos to Ms. Reeves's singing. The Orchestra of St. Luke's sounded splendid as well, although when the jazz ensemble was in action, the orchestra's presence ranged from superfluous to totally overwhelmed and thus nonexistent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henderson's whole-tone passages in ''Sophisticated Lady'' demonstrated a certain familiarity with Debussy but did nothing for the character of Ellington's great composition. The gentler accompaniments for Ms. Reeves's numbers sounded pleasant enough but came uncomfortably close to easy-listening. Nelson Riddle's arrangements for Frank Sinatra and Linda Ronstadt used the same dreamy genre with a stunning originality, one that these versions of ''Something to Live For'' and ''You're the One'' never managed.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's human nature that we're dealing with, and a natural urge to connect. Indeed, one of our first impulses when we make new friends is to introduce them to our old ones. But in the case of Duke Ellington Meets Classical Music, I would suggest that one plus one equaled less than two. So many of Mr. Henderson's touches seemed intent on showing us his prowess in classical orchestral style, and no one could doubt his easy sophistication. Pure Ellington, on the other hand, got lost in the demonstration. Listen to the Ellington band on records, and be lifted up by the sharpness and energy, an edge and a bite that a symphony orchestra can only dilute and weaken.</p>
        <p>Maybe someone will one day discover a common ground for these two significant branches of music, but the question remains: do we really need to? The idea of high and low art is increasingly difficult to maintain, and it is dawning on us keepers of the classical music flame that we are not the art but one of many arts. Sir Simon's concert -- peopled by splendid musicians working hard and joyously, and experienced by an enthusiastic audience -- still had more to do with separation than with contact.</p>
