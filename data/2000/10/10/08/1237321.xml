        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania sounded unconvincingly exuberant when he introduced his colleague, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in this fast-growing town west of Philadelphia on the morning after the year's first presidential debate.</p>
        <p>''Isn't it great,'' he asked, ''to wake up the day after a smashing victory?''</p>
        <p>Never mind that very few politicians, pundits or other political professionals, in this state or elsewhere, thought that Mr. Bush had won a ''smashing victory'' over Vice President Al Gore. Most considered the outcome more like a draw, with an edge, perhaps, to Mr. Gore on substance and to Mr. Bush on demeanor.  But whatever the result, the underlying reality is that Pennsylvania Republicans have little reason for exuberance about this year's race for the White House.</p>
        <p>When they are not uttering brave, morale-boosting words for public consumption, Republican politicians concede that with about 4 1/2 weeks until Election Day, Mr. Bush faces a steep uphill fight here. One respected poll shows him 12 percentage points behind, and another puts him 4 back.  Most professionals sense that the real margin must be in between.</p>
        <p>And that has national significance.  Pennsylvania, whose 23 electoral votes are the country's fifth-largest prize, has been one of a half-dozen or so major battlegrounds from the start of the 2000 campaign. If it slips from Mr. Bush's grasp, he will have to win Florida and most of the other swing states -- like Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio -- to win a majority in the Electoral College.</p>
        <p>''Unless something amazing happens, and I really can't imagine what it might be, Pennsylvania is a lost cause for Bush,'' said Prof. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University, west of Lancaster, Pa. ''It's starting to look an awful lot like 1992 and 1996. Nine percent for Bill Clinton, both times, and about the same for Gore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's biggest problem lies here in the Philadelphia suburbs, in the four counties that form a semicircle around the city, from Bucks in the north through Montgomery and Chester to Delaware in the south.  When Republicans like Mr. Ridge and the state's senior senator, Arlen Specter, do well, they almost always run strongly in the suburbs, helping to offset the usual big Democratic vote in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>In 1992 and 1996, however, Mr. Clinton spoiled that formula, doing well enough in the suburbs to carry the state. Since then, the suburbs have kept growing at the expense of Philadelphia; once redistricting has been completed in the next year or so, the city will probably have two districts, a loss of one, and the suburbs will have four or five.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Mr. Clinton captured the Eighth Congressional District, composed largely of leafy Bucks County, by 8,000 votes. He took Montgomery County's 13th Congressional District, which includes the aristocratic Main Line suburbs, by 22,000 votes.</p>
        <p>Private polls taken recently for local candidates show Mr. Gore doing nearly as well, with a chance, in the view of one Democratic strategist, of breaking even in the four-county region, losing lopsidedly Republican Chester but winning Montgomery by a solid margin.</p>
        <p>''Gore's hard to like,'' Professor Madonna said, ''but his stands on the issues fit the suburbs. Bush is having trouble with Republican women there, especially the younger ones, and with independents. A lot of it is abortion. It may not be at the top of the agenda, it may not be what they talk about first, but it's there. It's always there, and it certainly hurts Bush.''</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania has relatively few registered independents, and Democrats outnumber Republicans on voter rolls by more than 474,000, according to the latest tally. So it is obviously crucial for any statewide Republican candidate to hold every vote in his partisan base. Mr. Bush is in trouble here because he has failed to do that, at least so far.</p>
        <p>Four weeks ago, Mr. Bush came to Pennsylvania, a state with an unusually large number of old people -- second only to Florida, by some reckonings -- to announce his prescription drug plan. Mr. Gore was pounding away at him on the health care issue. But older people, the polls indicate, have continued to drift toward the Democrats, perhaps because Mr. Gore's drug plan is simpler and relies less on H.M.O.'s and drug companies, both unpopular in the state.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, in another visit to the state, Mr. Bush huddled with the Republican chairmen of the four suburban counties in Media, another picturesque town west of Philadelphia.  The subject: how to halt the alarming slide in his fortunes in this region.</p>
        <p>According to participants, Mr. Bush sought suggestions and got them.</p>
        <p>''We told him he needed to come in here more, let more people see him,'' said Alan Novak, the Chester County and also the Pennsylvania Republican chairman. ''And we told him that he needed to challenge the barrage of negative ads that the Democrats have been running here, picturing him as a failure on education, health care and the environment during his time as governor.''</p>
        <p>The debate Tuesday, Mr. Novak argued, ''put the personality factor back into the election, and that's  nothing but good for our side, because Gore comes across as pedantic, rude, the kid who never puts his hand down in class.''</p>
        <p>On issues, Mr. Novak said, Mr. Bush must ''show his centrist side.''</p>
        <p>West Chester, Radnor, Doylestown and the other suburbs tend to be moderate places. Mr. Ridge, not a particularly partisan governor, is especially popular here. So Mr. Bush's emphasis during the debate on his record of working successfully with both parties went down well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush worked hard during the debate to allay suburban women's fears about his opposition to abortion. When Mr. Gore charged that his rival would ''appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade,'' the Supreme Court decision upholding a woman's right to choose an abortion, Mr. Bush replied that ''voters should assume that I have no litmus test'' on abortion when nominating judges.</p>
        <p>The Texan also gave a decidedly soft-edged answer to a question from the moderator of the debate, Jim Lehrer, when Mr. Lehrer asked whether Mr. Bush, if elected, would try to overturn last week's decision by the Food and Drug Administration allowing doctors dispense RU-486, an abortion-inducing pill.</p>
        <p>While he was ''disappointed'' by the decision, Governor Bush commented, he doubted that a president had the power to overturn such a decision (although the F.D.A. commissioner serves at the pleasure of the president). He added mildly, ''I hope the F.D.A. took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.''</p>
        <p>In his speech to a jubilant crowd at the Hollinger Field House at West Chester University, Mr. Bush steered well clear of social and cultural issues, emphasizing instead his tax cut plans and his contention that Mr. Gore would add ''thousands of bureaucrats'' to the federal payroll.</p>
        <p>But there was no evidence this week, either in the polls or in random interviews with voters here and at the big shopping mall at King of Prussia, north of here, that he was making much headway on abortion or on education, another topic on which suburban women tend to prefer the vice president. Mr. Ridge said that on abortion, in particular, everyone who cares already knows where the two candidates stand.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the state, the picture is more mixed. Allentown and the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre area, both north of Philadelphia, have a record of going with the statewide presidential winner, and both are closely contested this time. Scranton has seen more television commercials than any other city this year.</p>
        <p>But in hilly southwestern Pennsylvania, in the hardscrabble valleys of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, where steel was once king, Mr. Gore has recovered after a beginning so hesitant it stunned local politicians.</p>
        <p>When the vice president traveled to the area on Memorial Day, Lou Lignelli, the district director for Representative Frank R. Mascara, a Democrat, listened to his rather lackluster speech and commented unhappily, ''Gore just doesn't have it.'' By this week, Mr. Lignelli had changed his mind. He said he thought Mr. Gore could stage a blowout in the region and state.</p>
        <p>What happened?</p>
        <p>''The Gore campaign got its act together,'' he said. ''They moved to Nashville, they got themselves a better campaign manager, and then Gore picked Lieberman for vice president. That dissipated the morality issue in one fell swoop, and the morality issue counts for something in an area like this.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Novak promised that Mr. Bush would be back to Pennsylvania at least once every week until the election. His father, former President George Bush, who ran strongly in southeastern Pennsylvania in 1988 and narrowly carried the state, is due in the state next week. Perhaps he can supply the answer to the hard question his son asked at that meeting in Media in September: Why did the Reagan-Bush suburban majorities of the 1980's disappear in the 1990's?</p>
        <p>About This Series</p>
        <p>A series of articles last month examined four swing states -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan -- that are likely to be critical in the presidential race. This is the first of four articles revisiting the race in those states.</p>
