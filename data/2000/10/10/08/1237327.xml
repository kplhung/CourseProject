        <p>As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict spread into Lebanon and threatened to engulf the region, Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued Yasir Arafat a 48-hour deadline for restraining violent protests before Israeli troops would be authorized to use ''all available means'' to quell the riots.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, a former commander of Israel's army, delivered the ultimatum tonight, after Lebanese guerrillas pierced the Israeli border to abduct three Israeli soldiers and Palestinians sacked and burned a Jewish holy site, known as Joseph's Tomb, following the withdrawal of Israeli guards.</p>
        <p>''If we do not see a change in the patterns of violence over the next two days we will interpret this as an abandonment of the peace process by Arafat,'' Mr. Barak said. ''And we will instruct the Israeli Army and security forces to use all available means to stop the violence.''</p>
        <p>The Palestinians responded by ridiculing Mr. Barak's suggestion that the Israeli Army had been restrained in a nine-day confrontation that has cost more than 80 lives, most of them Palestinian.</p>
        <p>Ahmed Qurie, the Palestinian legislative speaker, said: ''Barak is giving ultimatums today -- to the Lebanese, the Syrians and now the Palestinians. But who started this conflict?''</p>
        <p>At the United Nations, the Security Council adopted a resolution today condemning the ''excessive use of force'' against the Palestinians. [Page 10.]</p>
        <p>The spread of violence to the north and the Lebanese border, which has been quiet since Israeli troops withdrew from southern Lebanon in May, started with a volatile demonstration by Palestinian refugees bused there from camps inside Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Israeli soldiers shot dead at least one refugee and wounded dozens who tried to break through the border fence, prompting Lebanese guerrillas to reawaken their dormant struggle against Israel.</p>
        <p>The Shiite Muslim guerrillas of the Hezbollah movement lobbed Katyusha rockets at an Israeli military post, injuring three soldiers. Under cover of fire, they also sneaked across the border and kidnapped three Israeli soldiers patrolling an area, the Shebaa Farms, that is still claimed by Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah said the kidnapping was carried out in the name of the 12-year-old Palestinian boy, Muhammad al-Durra, who was shot dead in the Gaza Strip last weekend.</p>
        <p>Lebanese guerrillas last seized a member of Israel's armed forces, Ron Arad, in 1986. He was later turned over to Hezbollah and is feared to be dead. Hezbollah said today that it would seek to trade its three new captives for about a dozen Lebanese held in Israeli jails, including two guerrilla leaders.</p>
        <p>After the abductions, the Israelis gave chase across the border with helicopter gunships, which strafed the area and fired rockets. Two cars were reportedly hit, wounding their civilian passengers.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Barak, who pledged many times to retaliate harshly against any guerrilla aggression after the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon ended, sent warplanes to strike back at the Hezbollah sources of fire. Israel also began massing troops, tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers along its northern border in what resembled ''an inverted withdrawal,'' a radio reporter said.</p>
        <p>In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian rioting against Israeli forces continued to rage, and, in the evening, the Israeli Army reported heavy firing on the Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area and a Jewish neighborhood in Hebron. Some settlers fired back, and the army began positioning tanks for a possible retaliation.</p>
        <p>''Up until now, our response has been restrained by peace process considerations,'' a senior military official said. ''If this were warfare, the response would be different.''</p>
        <p>And once the Sabbath ended, armed Jewish settlers began blocking junctions, Israeli television said, in some cases stoning cars with Palestinian license plates. They were protesting the Israeli withdrawal from Joseph's Tomb and the brief pullback from the Al Aksa Mosque area Friday.</p>
        <p>Late tonight, an Israeli bus heading for the Gaza Strip town of Rafah was fired on from a Palestinian-controlled area and eight Israelis were wounded, prompting Mr. Barak to close Gaza's airport. And Israel Radio reported a Palestinian was killed in the West Bank by a Jewish settler firing shots from a car.</p>
        <p>President Clinton spoke three times today with Mr. Barak, twice with Mr. Arafat and once with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, according to a senior White House official. ''What we're trying to do first is get the violence stopped so that this does not turn into a death spiral,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Addressing his nation tonight, Mr. Barak said Israel had entered a new stage in its history, when it would again be fighting for its right to exist in the Middle East. Looking unusually haggard, he stopped just short of pronouncing the peace effort dead, saying instead that it had reached a critical juncture.</p>
        <p>He sounded pessimistic. ''The other side has apparently chosen violence, and it will bear the responsibility for this choice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fiery and determined during a visit to Spain, Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, accused the Israelis of stepping up a campaign of violence against the Palestinians and of ''imposing a veritable siege on the Palestinian territories with the aim of starving our people.'' Israel has closed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza, a typical move before the Jewish Day of Atonement, which begins on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat have made promises to curtail the rioting and gun battles that threaten to bury the peace effort along with an ever-mounting number of casualties.</p>
        <p>But despite several supposed cease-fires, the fighting has continued, leaving a death toll of at least 83 after nine days. An Israeli civilian was among those killed today.</p>
        <p>Late tonight, Mr. Barak convened his security cabinet to discuss military options.</p>
        <p>''Are you ready for war?'' Yitzhak Herzog, Israel's cabinet secretary, asked a reporter before the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was also expected to start negotiations tonight to form what is being described here as a ''national emergency government'' uniting left and right. That would mean joining forces with Ariel Sharon, the right-wing opposition leader, whom the Arab world holds responsible for provoking the present wave of violence by a visit last week to a contested holy site in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>In a public message to Lebanon and Syria, Mr. Barak demanded that both governments exert their influence on anti-Israeli organizations in southern Lebanon and halt the ''hostile activity.''</p>
        <p>''We see Syria as being primarily responsible for the events in Lebanon in general,'' Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister, said on Israel Radio tonight, ''and for these incidents specifically.''</p>
        <p>The new Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, who was receiving the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, in Damascus today, blamed Israel for the ''dangerous situation,'' and his foreign minister called the Hezbollah action ''legitimate.'' Students there pelted the American Embassy with rocks and rubbish.</p>
        <p>Throughout the Middle East, with anti-Israeli demonstrations raging, a sense was growing that the fragile peace built over the last two decades was stretched to a breaking point over exploding hostilities.</p>
        <p>Even Jordan, usually placid, grew tense after troops opened fire on Palestinian refugees demanding that the Israeli Embassy be closed.</p>
        <p>Today, an Israeli effort to damp the conflict with the Palestinians went ''catastrophically wrong,'' according to an Israeli general, Benny Ganz.</p>
        <p>After American-observed negotiations with the Palestinians, Mr. Barak decided to eliminate a deadly point of friction by taking the domestic political risk of what he termed a temporary evacuation of Israeli forces from Joseph's Tomb, a heavily fortified island of Israeli control in the middle of Palestinian-ruled Nablus, in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>But even as the Israelis were pulling out, the agreement was breaking down. An Israeli officer was wounded as shots were fired in the presence of Palestinian security officials.</p>
        <p>And just hours after Israeli forces withdrew, a raucous Palestinian victory celebration turned gleefully destructive. Palestinians pushed past their own security officers to smash and set fire to the Jewish holy site, which Israel had entrusted to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>As Palestinian troops stood by,  hundreds of Palestinian men set upon the shrine with pickaxes and crowbars while black smoke billowed from the structure.</p>
        <p>The moment shaped Mr. Barak's decision by day's end to announce a deadline. In Israel's view, the Palestinian failure to protect the shrine raised serious questions about whether a truce agreement -- not to mention a peace deal -- could be trusted.</p>
        <p>''I'm concerned about the future,'' said Nahman Shai, a spokesman for the Israeli government. ''What does it mean? Is this the way that Yasir Arafat respects his commitments?''</p>
        <p>But that problem, which loomed large this morning, had been overshadowed by late afternoon by the renewal of a dormant conflict on the Israeli-Lebanese border.</p>
        <p>''All week, the question has been not only whether Arafat wants to bring the violence under control, but whether he was capable of it,'' a diplomat here said. ''Now we add to that a fire being lit across the region.''</p>
