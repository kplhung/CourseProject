        <p>Hegel</p>
        <p>A Biography.</p>
        <p>By Terry Pinkard.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 780 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Cambridge University Press. $39.95.</p>
        <p>According to the 18th-century philosopher David Hume, rigorous thinking in the solitude of his study led him ineluctably to the conclusion that neither he himself nor the physical world could be known to exist. But as soon as he went outside, he cheerfully admitted, he was as convinced of the reality of his walk through the streets of London as anyone else. Three philosophical generations later, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) could not have had a more different idea of the significance, or the results, of philosophical inquiry. Philosophy had a place in the greater world as a guide to the inner nature of reality and the key to a well-ordered life. It represented the climax of creation: the universe had passed through the eons of natural history and epochs of social history to achieve an understanding of its structure -- in Hegel's own thinking.</p>
        <p>At a time when philosophy has for the most part settled down to a quiet life of academic distinction of little interest to nonprofessionals, the conditions under which such extravagant claims could be maintained form an interesting historical puzzle. One of the merits of ''Hegel: A Biography'' is the light Terry Pinkard casts on this question. A common difficulty of the biographer of a thinker -- the absence of dramatic adventures away from the lecture hall or writing table -- turns into an advantage. In a text somewhat shorter than the latest Harry Potter, Pinkard manages to sketch the political modernization of Germany under the impact of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the post-Waterloo regime of restoration plus reform, providing a framework for the tale of his protagonist's career as theology student, tutor, newspaper editor, school principal and teacher and his final ascension to the leading ranks of the Berlin professoriate. We also learn what there is to know of Hegel's personal life: his student friendship with the poet HRated PG-13lderlin, the ill-treated illegitimate son born at the very time he was working out his theoretical celebration of family life, his love of wine, his many friends, his kindness and conscientiousness toward students, his obsessive enmity to academic rivals, his happy marriage to a woman apparently not put off -- as others in his circle were -- by his sexism.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Pinkard, a professor of philosophy at Georgetown University, does a creditable job of explaining Hegel's strictly philosophical ideas and largely overcomes the barrier of Hegel's notoriously obscure style. Much philosophy in Germany in Hegel's day took the form of responses to the ideas of Immanuel Kant. Awakened by Hume's skepticism from what he called the ''dogmatic slumbers'' induced by theologically inflected thought, Kant strove to demonstrate the possibility of true scientific knowledge and the rationality of ethics, aesthetic judgments and even religion. The cost of this demonstration was a distinction between reality-as-known-by-us and things as they are ''in themselves,'' which we cannot know.</p>
        <p>This seemed to Hegel to preserve too much of Hume's skepticism. His way out was to locate the problem in the terms in which it was framed. In Pinkard's paraphrase of Hegel's rethinking of the nature of knowledge, ''we do not begin reflection as isolated individual agents'' but ''within a way of life,'' sharing a ''social space'' of ''norms, entitlements and commitments.'' Knowledge, therefore, is historical in character: Kant's views were part of the Enlightenment's demand for freedom, both to understand the natural world and to shape the social world independently of tradition and dogma; Hegel's understanding that freedom can be exercised by people only as they are part of self-governing social wholes completes this spiritual movement.</p>
        <p>Actually, Hegel argued, this has been the implicit content of all culture. Religions, for instance, always venerated the human mind in the guises of various gods, and art presented the human ability to shape the world in the form of objects whose form manifested in historically specific ways this content of human mental freedom. But only philosophy ''completes the task of self-knowing that art and religion begin: bringing to self-consciousness not merely what matters to a particular 'people' but what ultimately matters to mankind in general -- that is, what 'spirit' really is.'' Thus philosophy is the intellectual discipline of modern times, the essential element in the creation of cultured people able at last to realize the human capacity for self-government. Like so many other modern thinkers, Hegel reserved the exercise of this capacity for a minority, a ''universal estate'' responsible for articulating the general interests of humankind. Only with government in the hands of university-trained civil servants and, ultimately, their teachers, that is, could Germany avoid the anarchy and terror of the French Revolution. As Pinkard puts it, the university was the center of modern culture, ''and philosophy -- Hegel's philosophy -- was the 'focal point' of the university.''</p>
        <p>This was not just Hegel's megalomaniac vision; he was such a significant social figure that the daylong celebration of his 56th birthday got greater play in the Berlin press than had a party for the king of Prussia (who responded by issuing an edict forbidding the reporting of any birthday other than his own).</p>
        <p>Yet it is clear that Hegel's thinking itself was governed by the historicity he stressed as fundamental to the life of ''spirit.'' While he took the word Wissenschaft, ''science,'' as the name for philosophical system-building, even in Germany ''science'' in its currently more central meaning, the empirically controlled study of nature, rapidly became the intellectual watchword.</p>
        <p>Pinkard is, unfortunately, too quick to accept Hegel's usage of Wissenschaft without explaining it, just as he notes Hegel's insistence on producing a general ''system'' of ideas without explaining what it meant or why it mattered. Similarly, he is content to note that ''Hegel was not in his own eyes offering up a 'bourgeois' philosophy.'' But, of course, in ''defending and articulating the rationality of the post-Napoleonic world,'' Hegel was providing a philosophy for the social order whose ''sacred site'' he identified as the stock exchange. By reducing social history to politics, Pinkard avoids, for example, examining the relation of Hegel's view of women to the emergence of the bourgeois family that he celebrated. And he limits his ability to explain just why in Germany around 1800 philosophy came to seem so central. Perhaps, a philosopher himself, Pinkard is happy just to savor that moment.</p>
