        <p>THE Emelin in Mamaroneck gave theater a good run, with season after season of homegrown productions of plays. But the audiences weren't there.</p>
        <p>Now it's easing audiences back to plays, mostly with short runs of touring productions. But something new and different is in the works: solo shows by established theater artists under the banner of a cabaret series.</p>
        <p>But when you get right down to it, what's the difference?</p>
        <p>Donna McKechnie, who will open the series next Saturday night, had the help of the playwright Christopher Durang in putting together ''The Music and the Mirror,'' a program named for Ms. McKechnie's signature song and dance in the original company of ''A Chorus Line.'' She will perform it, in an abridged version, at the Emelin, on Saturday (two shows, 7 and 9:30).</p>
        <p>In February the Emelin will also feature a cabaret performance by Kaye Ballard, a star of all media, who explains: ''It's theater. That's why I'm doing it.''</p>
        <p>Thus the Emelin's series, which runs through May, raises anew the question of the real difference between cabaret and theater. And the answer, essentially, is: there is no difference -- excepting the presence or absence of tables, glasses with ice cubes and other distractions associated with old-time night club rudeness. But then if it isn't one distraction, it's another: customers bearing beepers, cell phones and lozenges in cellophane wrappers.</p>
        <p>As boundaries between art forms are increasingly blurred, the list of established stage performers who develop their own shows grows, and the Emelin cabaret lineup is among the most luminous.</p>
        <p>Following Ms. McKechnie will be Priscilla Lopez (Nov. 18), Ruthie Henshall, an Olivier winner in London, (Dec. 9); Sally Mayes (Jan. 13), Alison Fraser (Feb. 10), Sam Harris (March 24), Lee Roy Reams (April 21) and Bonnie Franklin (May 19). As a way for the Emelin's managing director, John Raymond, to signal that the torch is being passed, Joan Crowe, a newcomer and a New Rochelle resident, is to appear in April.</p>
        <p>Cabaret has evolved from the long gone saloons, speak-easies, supper clubs and bistros to a legitimate, not just alternative, theater form. For old-timers like Ms. Ballard, cabaret, under any name, replaced vaudeville -- and Ms. Ballard played the toniest of them all: the Blue Angel, the Bon Soir, the St. Regis.</p>
        <p>And practically speaking, as musical theater wanes, or more positively  put, as it is being redefined, its most practiced performers are writing and collaborating on their own performance pieces, which are, more often than not, a storybook of their lives in theater, with songs as intrinsic to their themes as they are integrated to the book in a traditional musical.</p>
        <p>It's their show. And it's a job. It can also turn into an annuity.</p>
        <p>Of the possibilities of cabaret, Ms. McKechnie said: ''This is how the audience can see a performer perform, not just a singer singing a song. Or a dancer dancing. I can't take what I do into small clubs.'' In her show, which she described as show biz and real life, Ms. McKechnie is to re-create the original choreography of Michael Bennett and Bob Fosse. ''It's my way of honoring them, and it's a piece of history,'' she said. And for the strictly real life part, she will tell of her date with Fred Astaire.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Lopez, another ''Chorus Line'' original, doing a show about herself was scary. ''I said, 'never' but I know that my time to do it is now,'' she said. ''And I'm going to have a good time.''</p>
        <p>So will musical comedy buffs. Such cult followers should be advised that Ms. Lopez is to sing two songs from ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' -- yes, the musical that closed on Broadway after two previews. Ms. Lopez was in the chorus.</p>
        <p>''Just for ambience,'' Mr. Raymond said, the Emelin is to bring in five tables -- no, drinks will not be served -- at ringside. ''But this is still theater,'' he said with assurance. ''Our audiences are not accustomed to theater here anymore. Cabaret is bringing it back.''</p>
