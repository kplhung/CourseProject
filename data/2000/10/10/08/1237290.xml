        <p>Each month, at least one woman comes into Katterman's Sand Point  Pharmacy in Seattle to ask for a prescription drug. None of the women have seen or spoken to a doctor but each says she needs the drug immediately.</p>
        <p>The routine for a pharmacist there, Beverly Schaefer, never varies. First she ushers the woman into a private cubicle. Then she counsels them and gives them the prescription pill.</p>
        <p>The pill is an emergency contraceptive that can prevent pregnancy if it is taken within 72 hours after intercourse, and it is part of what public health officials say is a revolution that is potentially as important -- if quieter -- as the one initiated by the recent approval of the abortion-inducing pill, mifepristone, or RU-486. While mifepristone offers a way to end pregnancies, the emergency contraceptive pill can prevent them.</p>
        <p>The contraceptive pill's name is Plan B (as in, If Plan A -- the usual means of preventing pregnancy -- fails, try Plan B). Groups in several states expect to provide the pill to women who have not seen a doctor first. Washington has already done so. And Katterman's Pharmacy is one of 155 pharmacies, about 13 percent of those in the state of Washington, that are providing the pill under these circumstances. Women who want to find a pharmacy near them need only call 1 (888) not-2-late or visit the Web site not-2-late.com. The Web site from the maker of Plan B has a similarly catchy name -- GoToPlanB.com.</p>
        <p>Public health groups in Alaska are testing a pilot program to make emergency contraceptives available to women without requiring them to see a doctor, and groups in California and Oregon will soon put into place their own pilot programs. Earlier this month, Norway became the first country to make a similar drug, called NorLevo, available over the counter, on shelves and out in the open along with headache remedies and cold medicines. And on Thursday, the French Parliament changed its law on contraceptives to allow nurses to give NorLevo to teenage girls in schools, said Dr. Andre Ulmann, whose company, HRA-Pharma, makes NorLevo.</p>
        <p>Not only is Plan B approved in the United States as a prescription drug, but public health advocates have also gotten contraceptive pills approved in Canada and some African, Asian, and South American countries, including some, like Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela, where abortion is illegal.</p>
        <p>The new pill has the same ultimate effect as the old ''morning-after pill'' -- it uses high doses of hormones to prevent pregnancy. But the morning-after pill was never an actual product. Doctors would mix it up themselves, ripping open packets of birth control pills and telling women to take several of them -- the exact dose depended on the brand of pills. The regimen, while effective, often caused nausea and vomiting. The new pill, in contrast, is packaged, marketed and designed specifically to prevent pregnancy. It also has fewer side effects.</p>
        <p>But the emergency contraception pills are not universally accepted. While most public health experts and doctors say the pills are contraceptives, not abortion-inducing drugs, because they work before a fertilized egg has implanted itself in the uterus, some abortion opponents disagree. The National Right to Life Committee, for example, asked to comment on the pills, sent a fax saying that as far as it is concerned, once an egg is fertilized, a human life has begun. And most pharmacies in Washington, including Mrs. Schaefer's, have no signs advertising emergency contraception. ''There could be some controversy,'' Mrs. Schaefer explained.</p>
        <p>But, said Elise Wells, a public health advocate who helped start the Washington project and is now starting the one in Alaska, there has been little outcry in Washington from opponents. ''There had been concern that there would be protests and pickets, but that has not happened,'' Ms. Wells said.</p>
        <p>Public health advocates say the pill could provide enormous benefits.</p>
        <p>''Our belief is that if emergency contraception pills really were widely used, to their maximum potential, then the number of unintended pregnancies could be cut in half,'' said Dr. James Trussell, associate dean at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. ''It has a huge potential. But I can guarantee you that the emphasis in that sentence is on potential,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Plan B was born out of the passion of people like Dr. Trussell. It was the deliberate conception of a consortium of public health advocates who decided that there was a crying need for the drug, located a Hungarian company to make it and formed a company to market it in the United States. On July 28, 1999, the pill was approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration, and on Aug. 23, 1999, the marketing company, called the Women's Capital Corporation,  filled its first order -- for Planned Parenthood of Pasadena, Calif.</p>
        <p>At first, Plan B was sold only to groups like public health clinics and Planned Parenthood. But about two months ago the company put the pills into commercial distribution. It does not yet have sales figures from pharmacies. The company says that within the next year it will apply to the F.D.A. to sell Plan B over the counter.</p>
        <p>For 25 years, doctors have known that women can prevent most pregnancies by taking high doses of birth control pills within 72 hours after having unprotected intercourse -- the exact number of pills needed varied depending on the brand. Ordinarily, 8 out of 100 women who have unprotected intercourse during the second or third week of their menstrual cycle will become pregnant. But if they take high doses of birth control pills, just two will become pregnant.</p>
        <p>Medical experts say that a fetus is not harmed if a women takes emergency contraceptives and remains pregnant, and for that reason most experts say that women do not need pregnancy tests before taking the pill. The exact reason why the pills work is not established, Dr. Trussell said, although one thought is that they alter the uterine lining, making it inhospitable to a fertilized egg.</p>
        <p>But there were two problems with using birth control pills for emergency contraception. One is that half the women who take them feel nauseated and nearly one in five vomits, raising questions of whether women should take anti-nausea medication first and whether they should take more pills if they vomit. The other problem was simply the way the pills were provided. Doctors waited for women to ask for them. And even when women did ask, the pills hardly looked like routine medicine.</p>
        <p>''A lot of us felt that so long as physicians and nurses were cutting up packages of birth control pills and sticking them in an envelope with mimeographed instructions, this would never gain acceptance,'' said Dr. Sharon Camp, director of the Women's Capital Corporation, which markets and distributes Plan B. ''It looked like something from an insurgent feminist health clinic.''</p>
        <p>In July 1995, a small company, Gynetics, was formed to market a pill that would essentially be a high dose of ordinary birth control pills. The pill, called Preven, is still on the market, largely unstocked by drugstores and unknown by American women, Dr. Trussell said. Public health advocates thought they could do better.</p>
        <p>In December 1995, an international consortium of advocates for emergency contraception sought a company to make a pill specifically for emergency contraception that did not have the side effects of birth control pills. They found Gedeon Richter, a Hungarian firm, to make a pill consisting solely of a synthetic hormone, a progestin. Women would take one progestin pill immediately and a second one 12 hours later. The old birth control pill regimen provided women with a combination of estrogen and progestin.</p>
        <p>With the pill in production, the World Health Organization, a member of the consortium, then tested it, finding in an international study that it was just as effective as using birth control pills for emergency contraceptives. But with this pill, just 23 percent of women complained of nausea -- 50 percent fewer than with birth control pills -- and 5.6 percent vomited, 70 percent fewer compared with birth control pills.</p>
        <p>''This clearly is a better mousetrap,'' Dr. Camp said. ''It is easier to administer and easier to use.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, Dr. Camp started the company to market the drug. ''We think it is the world's smallest drug company,'' she said. ''It has three and a half people.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Camp said that although she loved the proposed name for the drug, Plan B, the F.D.A. was taken aback. ''It took seven months of appeal to get that trade name approved by the F.D.A.,'' Dr. Camp said. ''The guys at the nomenclature committee did not get it. They said the name is flippant.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the state of Washington did not wait for Plan B to get on the market. In March 1998, advocates, led by a nonprofit group called the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, or Path, along with the state's pharmacy association, the Washington State Board of Pharmacy, the University of Washington, and the public relations agency Elgin DDB -- the same company that helped with the promotion of mifepristone -- put into place a program that exploited a unique feature of the state's laws.</p>
        <p>In Washington, a pharmacist can form an agreement with a doctor in which the doctor delegates authority to the pharmacist to dispense specific prescription products, like pills or vaccines. The agreements can go into detail about such things as counseling patients and making sure that the drugs are appropriate for them.</p>
        <p>The method could work for morning-after pills, the advocates reasoned. At first the pharmacists gave women high doses of birth control pills or Preven, but more recently they have been giving out Plan B.</p>
        <p>So far, 30,000 women have received the pills, said Jane Hutchings at Path. Other states have slightly different laws but several, including Oregon, California and Alaska, could allow similar arrangements.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Schaefer of Katterman's Sand Point Pharmacy signed up right at the beginning, she said. But her interest started out as rather dispassionate. That changed when she met the doctor behind the prescriptions.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Schaefer, who had never heard of the doctor and knew nothing about her, set off to a neighborhood she did not know to meet the doctor and get the necessary papers in order. When she saw the doctor's office, she was shocked.</p>
        <p>''It had bars on the window. I had to show a picture ID to get in,'' Mrs. Schaefer recalled. ''I walked into this little waiting room and there were probably 30 women sitting there crying quietly. There was not a soul over the age of 25.''</p>
        <p>It turned out that the doctor ran an abortion clinic.</p>
        <p>''If I ever had any doubts about why I was doing this, that did it for me,'' Mrs. Schaefer said. ''If I could prevent anyone from being in that room, that would be my goal.''</p>
