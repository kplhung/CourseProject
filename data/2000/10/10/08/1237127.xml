        <p>Living with foul odors is a way of life for Harlem residents who live near the North River Water Pollution Control Plant. But now the city plans to decrease environmental monitoring of the site, and residents are furious.</p>
        <p>''Without that accountability and an action taken, this place could screw up the whole community,'' said Preston Stahly, who lives across the street from the plant. ''I think it's sort of a sewage Chernobyl.''</p>
        <p>The North River Community Environmental Review Board met with city officials Tuesday night to demand that the city step up its air quality monitoring for the sewage  plant, which is on the Hudson River between 137th and 145th Streets.</p>
        <p>The group wants the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which checks the plant and environs  for pollutants, to upgrade air monitoring devices and to install more monitors inside the plant and in Riverbank State Park. It also wants meteorological testing stations and continued testing for all pollutants.</p>
        <p>Jeff Ryan, a spokesman for the D.E.P., said the agency was working to meet the group's requests and would continue monitoring for some pollutants, including hydrogen sulfide. But it would no longer test for carbon monoxide and semivolatile organic compounds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan said that six years of environmental data collected at the plant and in the area showed that  those contaminants were not present in harmful amounts. He said the  State Department of Health found that discomforts associated with the plant's foul odors to be the only danger to public health.</p>
        <p>But L. Ann Rocker, chairwoman of the environmental group, said the community could not trust the test results because for two years, the data were collected by Intertek Testing Services.</p>
        <p>Several Intertek employees were indicted in September by a federal grand jury in Dallas on charges of falsifying data at Superfund and hazardous waste sites in Texas and other Western states.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, that is suspicious and invalidates any data that is collected,'' Ms. Rocker said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan said the incident had nothing to do with the Harlem tests.</p>
        <p>''It was something that was done in another office in another state,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We have no reason to believe that the data here was altered.''</p>
