        <p>BLUE STARS, flowering spurge, bowman's root: there's no hint of autumn splendor in their names, and yet combinations of these native perennials provide powerful color boosts to fall gardens.</p>
        <p>They do so with yellow through red foliage displays that decorate areas where flowers bloomed earlier.</p>
        <p>Though the various blue stars (Amsonias) differ in size and leaf form, each is a golden presence in fall gardens. Of the three I know best, WILLOW BLUE STAR  (A. tabernaemontana) is the most widely grown, having been incorporated in gardens as long ago as colonial times. It forms huge mounds of billowing beauty. Given sun, it will top out at more than three feet and can spread as much as six feet. In the bright shade of a north-facing location, its height and spread are more contained.</p>
        <p>Willow blue star's light blue flowers open for two to three weeks in May in central New Jersey gardens and cover the plant with pompons formed by tight flower clusters. Each flower in the cluster looks like a blue star. Throughout summer, the shimmering, lanceolate leaves catch sun, and at times, their rustling evokes images of willow trees.</p>
        <p>And then comes October and the stunning presence of its golden glory.</p>
        <p>Summer drought can shorten its fall performance, as it did last year, but its display should last several weeks this year.</p>
        <p>This is a plant for large borders that can handle flourishes of grand beauty. Thus, though I have long admired it in a friend's garden, I have never grown it in my in-town lot. I was delighted to learn about a DWARF BLUE STAR  form six years ago and immediately bought it. Botanists are arguing over its proper designation, debating as to whether it is a separate species or simply a variety. In any case, it is generally sold as Amsonia montana and is perfect for smaller gardens.</p>
        <p>Dwarf blue star is only two feet tall, with a spread of three feet. Many feel the spring flowers are a more intense blue than those on willow blue star.</p>
        <p>In a sunny border, I have paired it with the white, daisylike flowers of kalimeris, also known as Japanese aster. Just as the last blue flowers on dwarf blue star fade, the summer-long production of kalimeris flowers begins. Now, with only dark green foliage left on kalimeris, the golden leaves of dwarf blue star create a lovely contrast.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in a bright shade border dwarf blue star is a charming presence in the late spring garden and its golden foliage contributes the only color right now.</p>
        <p>ARKANSAS AMSONIA  (A. hubrectii) is a newcomer to the garden scene. Discovered in 1942, it languished in obscurity until Bob McCartney, owner of the Woodlanders nursery, offered it commercially in the early 1980's. Savvy landscape designers have been planting it ever since.</p>
        <p>Arkansas amsonia is so strikingly different from the other two blue stars that I'm surprised botanists aren't debating its classification, too. While it does bear blue, star-shaped spring flowers, its soft, curving leaves are as fine as pine needles. They swirl about sturdy stems in clumps three to four feet tall. In fall, they turn a sumptuous golden tan and are especially beautiful fluttering in late-season sunlight.</p>
        <p>Since the leaves on this blue star change color several weeks later than the other two, they create a wonderful November farewell to my garden year. To keep the Arkansas amsonia height more in line with my small borders, I cut them back to a foot after they finish flowering. Untouched, they are especially striking on hillsides.</p>
        <p>FLOWERING SPURGE  (Euphorbia corollata) is a dependable sun-to-bright-shade bloomer in summer gardens, producing tiny white flowers from July into September. In other aspects, it is rather fickle. Its height varies from one to four feet, and the slim, two-inch-long blue-green leaves turn anywhere from yellow to fiery red.</p>
        <p>I've paired it with boltonias, which start to open their white, asterlike flowers in early September. Thus, just as flowering spurge stops blooming, the boltonia kicks in. The colorful fall foliage on the flowering spurge adds just the right accent to this grouping.</p>
        <p>BOWMAN'S ROOT  is my favorite fall foliage perennial, and I find it hard to fathom why it is not more widely known and grown. Often listed as Gillenia trifoliata in printed material, it is now officially dubbed as Porteranthus trifoliata.</p>
        <p>Shrublike in appearance, bowman's root is a compact two-to-four-foot-tall perennial. The more sun, the larger the plant. Even without flowers, its red stems and glossy cut-leaf foliage are handsome. In June, myriad white star-shaped flowers cover the plant, inevitably drawing oohs and ahs from those who are not familiar with it.</p>
        <p>It is now, however, that it is truly outstanding, because its leaves turn a fiery red and light up fading perennial borders. To further heighten the burning glow, I surround the plants with pots of white chrysanthemums.</p>
        <p>These perennials certainly show that one should never judge a plant solely by its name.</p>
