        <p>I took care of my father in the last months of his life as he battled stomach cancer.

        <p>I took care of my father in the last months of his life as he battled stomach cancer. I slept in the bedroom next to his, monitoring every hour of his day and night, and I treasured our closeness -- in large part because it came so late in his life. Before his illness, he always kept us all at arm's length. He was quick to anger if we challenged him, intolerant of scrutiny of any kind. And then, only weeks before I lost him forever, I learned why.</p>
        <p>He had gone in eight short months from being a skiing, bike-racing, dating man of 70 to a shrunken, exhausted soul with paper-thin skin, and in this condition he revealed to my brother, sister and me the shameful secret he had kept buried since childhood: when he was 14, his mother and sister had deliberately set fire to their dry goods shop to collect insurance money. It was late at night, and the couple who lived in the apartment above the store came running out from the flames, screaming and carrying their children in their arms. They could have easily been killed.</p>
        <p>My father had no part in planning the arson, but he saw what happened, and it changed his life forever.</p>
        <p>''I came from people who were despicable,'' he told us through a flood of tears. ''They set this fire out of their own greed. I tried to excuse it by telling myself that survival forced us to do these things.'' He looked anguished. ''Survival? We had enough to eat. We had a place to sleep. We had our own store. Some of our neighbors considered us rich. To risk killing children so you can make a fancier store? That's evil. I was part of evil. Now you see why I'm ready to die?''</p>
        <p>My brother asked, ''Are you saying you deserve to die?''</p>
        <p>''No, no,'' he insisted. ''It's not that. It's that I'm tired of living with shame. I've held on to it all these years. I'm exhausted from trying to cover up, driving and driving myself. Dying is the way I can let go of it at last.'' But even after he confessed, he did not forgive himself. Shame had been his companion in life, and it went with him into death.</p>
        <p>In search of some way to deal with the pain of losing him, I turned to religious traditions, though my family had ignored them for two generations. I began attending synagogue to say Kaddish. I was a neophyte, but by Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, I had learned the Hebrew word ''teshuvah.'' Literally, it means to return; on Yom Kippur it is used to describe the work of remembering who you once knew yourself to be. I recited the Vidui, a list of transgressions from A to Z: we abuse, we betray, we are cruel, we destroy, we embitter, we falsify, we gossip, we hate, we insult . . . we yield to evil. And I learned that the hardest work of atonement is not naming your transgressions, but finding the courage to forgive yourself for pain inflicted on others -- an exercise that brings you face to face with shame.</p>
        <p>During Yiskor, the prayers in memory of the dead, the rabbi asked the congregation: ''If this day is about forgiveness, why do we remember people whose lives are over? Hasn't their chance for forgiveness passed?'' We waited for his answer: ''They have a new chance for forgiveness through you. You bring them into this day through your prayers, your memories.'' I was sobbing before I knew it, in agony at the memory of how my father's life had been constricted by shame. Every day, every action, every relationship had been defined by his efforts to cover and hide his secret -- and the sin wasn't even his, though he felt complicit in it. My father revered honesty; how awful he must have felt concealing this horrible vision for nearly 60 years. He treasured family and friendship; how wretched it must have been for him to hold himself apart from people for fear of being found out. It all seemed unbearably sad.</p>
        <p>I followed my rabbi's direction: I brought my father into the day through my memories of him. I felt his presence as surely as if his hands were on my shoulders. And then I understood the miracle of my father's confession. In confronting yourself truthfully, you start to forgive yourself, and with forgiveness comes the possibility of a new beginning. My father had created a new beginning, not for himself -- it was too late for that -- but for us, his children. He showed us his courage, his determination to face his shame. Facing the truth restored my father to himself, but it also restored him to us. In his final days, he at last allowed himself to feel loved and to give love in return. I live every day in that love he found.</p>
